THE BIG PROFILE
SIMON PEGG
By Dave Itzkoff
If Simon Pegg were forced to name the collaborator who brought the warmest glow to his geek-culture-connoisseur's heart, it wouldn't be his ''Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol'' co-star Tom Cruise or the director Brad Bird. He would probably say Steven Spielberg, who directed him and Nick Frost in ''The Adventures of Tintin'' and caused some we're-not-worthy moments. ''We'd say, very casually: 'So what was it like shooting ''Close Encounters''? Was that fun?' '' Pegg says. ''He'd tell us a big, long story about it, and we'd just nod and be like, 'Yeah, whatever.' And then we'd get outside and scream and hold each other.''
WASHINGTON MONUMENTS
WOW, THAT'S SOME AWESOME HAIR, MR. MODERATOR! 
By Matt Bai
I loved the idea of Donald Trump moderating a well-attended Republican presidential debate. Sure, maybe it debased the process a little, if that's even possible at this point. But after what seems like 400 debates in which the questions were asked by TV pundits, Tea Party members and ghosts from the Reagan administration, we deserved some levity. That Mitt Romney, Rick Perry and others decided to skip the event would mean only one thing: the world could get to hear from Rick Santorum.

VIVA CONTROL GROUPS
By Jacob Goldstein
There are three main offenses that can get you fired from Caesars, says the gambling company's C.E.O., Gary Loveman, who is also a former Harvard professor with a Ph.D. in economics. They are stealing, harassment and, perhaps most important, running an experiment without a control group. The company has studied everything from who responds best to freebies to how to get waiters to move more high-margin items. Regarding the latter, offer a bonus that's not too big. ''Too large an incentive makes the waiter obnoxious,'' he says.
CREATIVE CHEATING
By Heather Havrilesky
Science now bears out what the girlfriends of musicians, poets and painters have known for centuries: creative people are more likely to cheat than their less creative counterparts. Researchers at Harvard and Duke have found that creative thinkers are more likely to take unethical shortcuts for gain, possibly because their talents make them better at rationalizing bad behavior. And don't creative people also believe they can win us back with a creative apology, a creative excuse or a creative defense in court? ''This is an interesting possibility,'' says the lead researcher, Dr. Francesca Gino. But the bottom line, Gino said, is that ''creativity makes people more morally flexible.''
THE MOB AND YOU
REMEMBER THE NEEDIEST
By Tom Folsom
When exchanging gifts with colleagues, avoid the example set by the mobster Joe Colombo. In return for a diamond watch, he offered members of the Gallo family ''the same cheap ties,'' recalled Peter Diapoulos, a k a Pete the Greek. During the Gallo-Colombo war of the 1970s, he was shot in Columbus Circle.

BITE ME!
By Hope Reeves
Since most dog bites come from pets owned by family, friends or neighbors, suing may seem out of the question. Not true, says Kenneth M. Phillips, a Beverly Hills lawyer who focuses on ''dog-bite law.'' Phillips claims to have recovered tens of millions of dollars over 30 years. He says: ''It's often the homeowners' insurance that pays. Why wouldn't they want their loved ones to benefit?''
TO THE MOON, NOVELISTS
By Maud Newton
In this era of space-flight cutbacks and dangerously outmoded reactors, do we need better speculative fiction to fuel innovation? The author of ''Snow Crash,'' Neal Stephenson, thinks so. Denouncing today's pessimistic sci-fi, he advocates a return to the techno-optimism of the genre's golden age, which brought us ''Asimov's robots'' and ''Heinlein's rocket ships.'' NASA, meanwhile, has dispatched its scientists to assist Tor Books authors in developing a series of ''NASA-inspired works of fiction.''

HEADLINE: Slapped Wrists At WaMu

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
WHEN Washington Mutual collapsed in 2008, it was the largest bank failure in American history. So the $64.7 million settlement struck last week by federal banking regulators and three former WaMu executives seems like small potatoes indeed.
Worse, most of the money didn't even come from the former executives' pockets. Instead, it came from directors' and officers' liability insurance policies paid for by the bank.
The deal, agreed to by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, requires that the men, among them Kerry Killinger, WaMu's former chief executive, forgo claims for insurance coverage and some past compensation that they had requested from the bankruptcy court. 
To anyone familiar with WaMu's Wild West lending practices -- ''The Power of Yes'' was the bank's motto -- the agreement might seem like yet another example of the minimalist punishment meted out to major players in the credit boom and bust.
Here are the particulars: Mr. Killinger paid $275,000 in cash. He also agreed to forfeit claims against his WaMu retirement accounts with a face amount of $7.5 million.
These sums are a pittance when set against the $88 million in compensation that Mr. Killinger received from the bank from 2001 to 2007.
Stephen Rotella, WaMu's former president, paid $100,000 in cash and gave up a claim to $11.5 million in compensation. David Schneider, its former home loans president, paid $50,000 and forfeited a claim to $5.8 million.
Mr. Rotella and Mr. Schneider were able to hang on to other claims that they have filed in the WaMu bankruptcy: Mr. Rotella retained a retirement account valued at $5.4 million, while Mr. Schneider kept a $1.9 million claim. It is unclear whether WaMu will pay these claims, of course. If it does, the executives will have to pay taxes on them.
''Pretty soft,'' is how Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate's permanent subcommittee on investigations, characterized the settlement in an interview on Friday.
''Washington Mutual Bank epitomizes everything that went wrong with the banking industry and contributed to the financial crisis, so the F.D.I.C. was right to go after the bank's leadership,'' Mr. Levin said in a statement issued on Tuesday. ''Former WaMu executives Killinger, Rotella and Schneider are truly the 1 percent: they got bonus upon bonus when the bank did well, but when they led the bank to collapse, insurance and indemnity clauses shielded them from paying any penalty for their wrongdoing.''
Officials at the F.D.I.C. said they were pleased with the settlement and that it maximized its recoveries. The $64.7 million will be combined with $125 million that WaMu's holding company agreed to relinquish to the regulator.
Although the settlement probably disappoints anyone hoping executives might be held personally accountable, it does illustrate what regulators are up against when litigating these matters.
For starters, the F.D.I.C. faced a time constraint. The insurance policies being tapped by the regulator were declining steadily in value as others making claims against the bank were paid.
The F.D.I.C. also had to confront the circular nature of the continuing WaMu bankruptcy and the claims being made against the institution. If the regulator had asked for higher payments from the former executives, the men could have turned around and requested that the bankrupt company pay the amounts under its indemnification policies. If the company did have to cover the F.D.I.C.'s requests, it could reduce the $125 million that WaMu has agreed to give the regulator.
Given these risks and the costs of continuing litigation, the F.D.I.C. said, it made sense to complete the $64.7 million deal.
Lawyers representing Mr. Killinger and Mr. Schneider did not respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Rotella issued this statement through a spokesman: ''I believe the facts clearly demonstrate that during my brief tenure at WaMu, my efforts substantially reduced risk and addressed highly challenging business problems that predated my arrival. I continue to strongly dispute the F.D.I.C.'s allegations and regret that we did not have more time to finish restructuring WaMu successfully.''
Mr. Levin's dismay over the settlement probably arises from his deep knowledge of WaMu and its practices. After all, he led the Senate's 2010 investigation into the origins of the financial crisis, producing a 650-page report on actions taken by WaMu, Goldman Sachs and the credit ratings agencies, among others.
Mr. Levin's office referred the findings to prosecutors for possible follow-up. Not much has happened since.
The damning report detailed WaMu's questionable operations as well as those of its regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision. That feckless agency was responsible for overseeing three of the biggest disasters in mortgage lending history: Countrywide Bank, IndyMac Bancorp and WaMu. Mercifully, the Dodd-Frank law put an end to the O.T.S., folding it into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
ARE the WaMu executives out of the woods? They're getting close. Last summer, the Justice Department shut down its criminal investigation into WaMu and its officials, concluding that the evidence it had amassed ''did not meet the exacting standards for criminal charges in connection with the bank's failure.''
Mr. Levin noted that the O.C.C. could still act against WaMu's former executives.
''There are some real possible enforcement actions they can take to go after civil money penalties,'' he said. ''They have the ability to go after securities violations for securities WaMu issued that were defective or misleading, unsafe and unsound practices, breach of fiduciary duty, general disregard for banking regulations -- there's still a way to get more accountability.''
Asked whether the O.C.C. would pursue such actions, a spokesman declined to comment.
Unfortunately, the agency's history does not suggest that it will act aggressively on this matter. If past is prologue, the accountability deficit that many Americans find so disturbing is likely to grow even larger.

HEADLINE: Mitt Romney Makes a Rare Sunday Television Show Appearance

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney sits down with Chris Wallace of "Fox News Sunday" and talks about President Obama, his wife's diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and the word "zany." 

 BODY:
In an interview with Chris Wallace on "Fox News Sunday," in his first Sunday morning television show appearance in nearly two years, Mitt Romney sat down for a wide-ranging conversation that included how he would take on President Obama - and how Mr. Obama would try to portray him - in a general election and how he dealt with his wife's diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.
Mr. Wallace began the interview by pointing out that in a general election, President Obama plans to position himself as a champion for the middle class, while painting the Republican nominee - whoever that may be - "as pushing tax cuts for the wealthy, spending cuts for the poor and rolling back regulations that help protect people and the environment."
Aren't you vulnerable to that, Mr. Wallace asked Mr. Romney, whose net worth is estimated at $200 million.
Mr. Romney responded that it was exactly the opposite. President Obama is "extraordinarily vulnerable," Mr. Romney said, "because we'll say 'How did that work Mr. President? Your four years in office, just how would those programs work? Did the poverty decline in this country or did it go up? How about joblessness?'" 
President Obama, he added, "came into office and said 'Let me borrow $787 billion and I'll keep unemployment below 8 percent,' which itself was an extraordinarily high number. And it hasn't been below 8 percent since. His policies have not worked."
Mr. Romney added that he wasn't opposed to regulation, but favored "updated and modern" regulation that encourage business growth.
"His great failing is he does not understand how this economy works and how his policies have made it harder for this economy to put Americans back to work," Mr. Romney said. "I do know how the economy works and my policies are designed to get people what they desperately want, not care for being poor. They want to stop being poor, have a good job and have a bright future."
Mr. Romney, however, praised Mr. Obama for capturing and killing Osama bin Laden.
"We're delighted that he gave the order to take out Osama bin Laden," Mr. Romney said. "Any president would have done that, but this one did, and that's a good thing. I'm not going to say everything he's done is wrong."
When the topic turned to Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House who is now leading in many national polls, Mr. Romney stood by his earlier assessment that Mr. Gingrich has been an "unreliable" conservative leader, as well as "zany."
"We're different and a campaign is about pointing out differences," said Mr. Romney, who in recent weeks has ramped up his attacks on Mr. Gingrich.
Referring to the plan proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin to overhaul Medicare, Mr. Romney said that while almost every Congressional Republican stood together in support of the plan, Mr. Gingrich used his perch to undermine it.
"And the world watched to see, O.K., are we going to have progress?" Mr. Romney said. "And the speaker said, 'This is right-wing social engineering.' Talk about unreliable. At a critical time, he cut the legs out from underneath a very important message. The same was true with regards to cap and trade," under which polluters pay for excess pollution. 
As for "zany," a word Mr. Romney used to describe Mr. Gingrich in an interview with The New York Times, he explained: "I don't think you would call mirrors in space to light highways at night particularly practical, or a lunar colony a practical idea, not at a stage like this."
Mr. Wallace also pushed Mr. Romney on what he called "Romneycare," the individual mandate health care program Mr. Romney put in place in Massachusetts when he was the governor here. In 2004 interview on "Meet the Press," Mr. Wallace pointed out, Mr. Romney had said it would be a good idea if other states adopted what he called his "mandate approach."
"I like what we did, I'm proud of what we did," Mr. Romney said. "I'm not going to tell Texas what Texas has to do, or California or New York. I think the ideas that we put forth work. We'll see which parts of them work and which don't. But I'm not, as president of the United States, going to do what this president did, which is to impose his will on the entire nation."
The interview was highly anticipated, as Mr. Wallace had waged an on-air campaign this year to get Mr. Romney to appear on his show.
"We have now interviewed all the major Republican candidates in our 2012 'One on One' series - except Mitt Romney," Mr. Wallace said, following an interview with Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. "He has not appeared on this program or any Sunday talk show since March of 2010. We invited Gov. Romney again this week, but his campaign says he is still not ready to sit down for an interview."
But after an interview with Fox's Bret Baier, in which Mr. Romney appeared testy and defensive, the Romney campaign sent him out on a media blitz, including Mr. Wallace's show.
Near the end of the interview, with lasted roughly 30 minutes and was pre-taped Saturday morning in Charleston, S.C., Mr. Romney turned emotional when talking about his wife, Ann, who has weathered diagnoses of multiple sclerosis and breast cancer.
"How would you describe your relationship?" Mr. Wallace asked. "Are you sweethearts? Are you partners? Are you best friends?"
"All three," Mr. Romney replied. "Ann and I fell in love when we were in high school. It doesn't happen to a lot of people." 
He added: She's a remarkable woman. And she's gone through some tough times. She had a diagnosis of M.S., she's had breast cancer. And my feelings and passion for Ann haven't changed in the slightest over the years, other than to become stronger."
Mr. Romney said that the "toughest time" in his life was standing with Ann as she got her multiple sclerosis diagnosis.
"We stood up and hugged each other," Mr. Romney said. "And I said to her, 'As long as it's not something fatal, I'm just fine.' But I'm, look, I'm happy in life as long as I've got my soul mate with me. And Ann is."
He said that the period was especially bleak for Ann, who was often exhausted and no longer able to care for their family in the way that she previously had.
"And I said, 'Look, I don't care what the meals are like, you know, I like cold cereal and peanut butter sandwiches,'" Mr. Romney said. "We could do fine with that as long as we have each other. And if you think about what makes a difference to you in your life, it's people. Life is all about the people you love." 
He added: "Death, that's a different matter. Death, I don't know that I can handle death. Disease and hardship, we can handle as long as we have the people we love around us."

HEADLINE: Making a List, and Taking It to the Pawnshop

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN and STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Children in San Mateo, Calif., whispered their wish lists to Santa Claus this weekend at Best Collateral, a pawnshop in a strip mall about 20 miles south of San Francisco.
And if their parents didn't mind discounted gifts -- well, to be realistic, used or hocked ones -- they did their shopping there, too.
Christmas this year has come to the neighborhood pawnshop -- and business is booming like never before. 
Sue Gallagher, 54, is one shopper who now works through her Christmas list at a pawnshop before heading to Wal-Mart or Target.
She recently bought a television for her daughter at Tom's Pawn Shop in Lake Jackson, Tex., a ''decent-sized flat-screen TV for less than $100.'' She described the experience as festive, with ''garlands and tinsel and some music playing in the background.''
''I didn't feel like I was shopping in a pawnshop,'' said Ms. Gallagher, who works for a nursing service.
Tom's is not the only pawnshop that is thriving. At the Pawn America chain of stores in the Midwest, the founder Brad Rixmann said his business was up 50 percent this holiday season over last year. In San Diego, Yigal Adato, a co-owner of CashCo Pawn, said customers were showing up with Christmas lists, desperate to save money.
''We've had a couple of customers who say, 'You know, if it wasn't for you guys' prices, my kids wouldn't be getting anything this year,' '' Mr. Adato said.
While some customers have always bought Christmas gifts at pawnshops, only recently has the idea gained widespread acceptance, said Emmett Murphy, a spokesman for the National Pawnbrokers Association. So far, this holiday season has been the best one yet, he said.
Many pawnshops, in turn, are embracing holiday shoppers like never before, offering promotions long deployed by more traditional stores, like ''25 Days of Deals,'' ''Black Friday'' specials -- even visits from Santa. It underlines how the recession has hit those at the bottom of the economic spectrum, for whom even Wal-Mart can be too expensive.
''We want people to think of us as an alternative to Target, Best Buy,'' Mr. Rixmann said. ''You can buy stocking stuffers for next to nothing.''
The gloomy economy is the most immediate explanation, but industry experts also point to the success of television shows like ''Pawn Stars,'' which have attracted a more mainstream audience to the stores.
''People look at it now as a place to find stuff and find a bargain, where before they may have been afraid of it or figured it was all stolen,'' said Mark J. Perry, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, Flint.
Pawnshops get their name from the fact that customers can ''pawn'' merchandise as collateral in exchange for a loan. When the money is paid back -- with interest of course -- pawnbrokers return the merchandise.
If the customer doesn't pay back the money, however, the pawnbroker keeps the merchandise and resells it.
In the years since the economy has soured, pawnshops have been making more loans than ever, and the average amount of a loan has grown from $80 in 2008 to $150 today, said Mr. Murphy. In addition, pawnbrokers were flooded by customers looking to sell gold jewelry when gold prices soared this year.
On the retail side, sales had been more tepid before the holiday surge, because many customers are flat-out broke. Owners of pawnshops melted down much of the jewelry in stock because there were so few buyers, Mr. Murphy said. But the tide has turned, at least for some pawnshops. Sleek chains that resemble mainstream, big-box retailers and offer a much wider range of merchandise, some of it new, are replacing mom-and-pop shops. As the industry consolidates, the number of pawnshops has fallen to roughly 10,000 from 12,500 in 2008, Mr. Murphy said.
Mr. Rixmann of Pawn America said his own trajectory illustrates the trend: his first store was 700 square feet; and one of his newest stores, in Madison, Wis., is 35,000 square feet in a former Circuit City.
Mr. Adato of CashCo Pawn said about 60 percent of its sales started on layaway, because ''people might need a paycheck or two to pay it off.'' And he offers even deeper discounts around the holidays. December sales include half off diamond jewelry, 30 percent off electronics and 40 percent off tools.
La Familia Pawn and Jewelry, a chain of shops based in Florida, threw a ''Why Wait Wednesday'' event the day before Thanksgiving, trying to get an edge on stores like Wal-Mart that offered Thanksgiving specials. Revenue over Thanksgiving weekend rose 40 percent from a year ago, La Familia's co-founder and chief financial officer, Woody Whitcomb, said.
Other pawn stores have a way to go before shoppers feel the warm glow of the holidays. Richard Sears, 43, who owns the Jazzy Dog Cafe in Orlando, Fla., said he was shopping more and more at pawnshops now because his ''restaurant is getting clobbered.''
While they have put up holiday decorations, the shops he frequents are ''in the really worst parts of town,'' he said.
''They try,'' Mr. Sears said, ''but it's hard to be festive when you're putting garlands on burglar bars.''
Don Bellville, the executive vice president of Best Collateral, a group of pawnshops in California, said his stores had embraced the holidays in the last two years by offering deals, bringing in Santa and putting some snowflakes in the windows. But he acknowledged there were limits on how far any pawnshop could go.
''Macy's we are not,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Oil Drilling Rig Sinks in Storm Off Eastern Russia, Leaving 49 Missing and 4 Dead

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- An oil drilling rig that was being towed in a storm sank Sunday off the coast of Sakhalin Island, Russia, with 67 people on board, most of whom are still missing. 
Rescuers found 14 survivors, 4 bodies and two life rafts floating empty in the frigid Pacific Ocean, off Russia's east coast just north of Japan. The rig was not operating when it listed in high waves and sank.
The two ships that had been towing the rig, an icebreaker and a tugboat, found the 14 survivors, according to a statement from the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations.
Later, reports by the Interfax news agency said rescuers pulled four bodies from the sea, and found the two empty life rafts, leaving 49 people unaccounted for by early Sunday evening.
Officials said search teams would work into the night, despite high seas, and that the crew had access to survival equipment, including life vests. The ministry of transport said the rig sank quickly, within about 20 minutes, at about 2 a.m.
Water flowed into the structure, the ministry staid, after pipes were damaged by the tow lines.
''The rig's water discharge systems were operating at their maximum capacity,'' but that did not help, Interfax reported, quoting an unidentified Transportation Ministry official.
The accident appears to have put the lives of more workers in danger than the April 2010 disaster at BP's Macondo drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11. The well blowout caused a spill that spewed oil into the gulf for months.
Though the Russian rig, called Kolskoye, was not drilling when it sank, the accident was a setback for Russia's ambitions to expand offshore drilling to replace declining output on land, and maintain oil exports that are vital to the country's economy.
As the United States has taken a go-slow approach to drilling in icy, northern waters off the coast of Alaska, the Russians have pushed ahead with plans to drill in their sector of the Arctic Ocean and other storm-prone and ice-clogged areas, where rescue and cleanup work is considerably more complex.
The Russian national oil company, Rosneft, created a joint venture this year with Exxon Mobil to look for oil in the Kara Sea, an inlet off the Arctic Ocean. Under the deal, Exxon and Rosneft agreed to finance a research institute in St. Petersburg, Russia, to study maritime safety for the oil industry in icy seas.
Sakhalin Island lies in the Sea of Okhotsk, which covers a petroleum-rich shelf where Exxon Mobil and Shell have already have developed offshore fields. The sea is a part of the Pacific Ocean bordered by the Kuril Island chain and the eastern coast of Siberia, and it is partly covered by ice floes in the winter.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Learning From the Military

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Military Children Stay a Step Ahead of Public School Students,'' by Michael Winerip (On Education column, Dec. 12): 
No preparation for standardized tests, no mandated teacher evaluations, no teacher bashing, a place where ''children are children'' and outperform the average American public school student. Is this Finland? An upscale private school? As you report, it is neither; it is a military base school in North Carolina.
There are some lessons here for our policy makers to consider before they leap on the bandwagon of grandiose, and ultimately ineffective, school reform initiatives. When parents are not burdened by unemployment, threats of foreclosure and worries about health care, and when they are provided time off to attend a school production or to coach a school team, they support their schools and encourage their children to succeed academically.
When educators are recognized as professionals who are capable of making sound instructional decisions that are based on student needs and not on government mandates, they achieve good results. And when children are taught well rather than test-prepped, they achieve beyond expectations -- and they discover the joy in learning that we seek for all our children.

HEADLINE: The Road From Poverty to Health

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''To Fix Health, Help the Poor'' (Op-Ed, Dec. 9):
Although Elizabeth H. Bradley and Lauren Taylor never use the words ''social determinants of health,'' they are illustrating the profound truth that it is the circumstances in which people live and work that determine the health status of any population, in any nation.
Along with that come some counterintuitive truths. First, that health care, while crucial to individual survival, makes at best a modest contribution to population health. 
Second, that most social and economic policies are in effect health policies because of their impact on those social determinants. Even a perfect American health care system (let alone what we have now) cannot by itself fix our abysmal maldistribution of health.
When my colleagues and I worked at the nation's first community health center in the Mississippi Delta in the 1960s, our doctors saved many lives and eased much suffering.
We repaired collapsing plantation shacks. We built sanitary privies. In the face of devastating poverty, unemployment and malnutrition, we organized a cooperative farm where residents grew tons of vegetables, and we found pathways to jobs and education.
Those interventions did far more to save lives, ease suffering and improve our target population's health than our medical care did.
H. JACK GEIGER Brooklyn, Dec. 9, 2011
The writer is professor emeritus of community medicine at the City University of New York Medical School.
To the Editor:
Elizabeth H. Bradley and Lauren Taylor make a convincing case for more public financing of essential social services to achieve a healthier society rather than concentrating spending on health care services per se. In reading the description of the services their study included, I was surprised and dismayed not to find education on their list.
Surely a good education has as much of an effect on lifelong health and well-being as employment-training programs or any of the other programs they cite.
Further, spending on social services leverages our direct investment in schools in the same way it does for health care. Only when children have the basic necessities -- proper nutrition and a stable and supporting home -- can they truly take advantage of the opportunities that education provides.
I'd like to see a follow-up to the study that includes education spending. My guess is that the results would be similarly enlightening.
THERESA LANG Brooklyn, Dec. 10, 2011
To the Editor:
The fact is that we waste far too much of our economy on a health care system that is financed and administered more like a credit-default swap than like the social service it should be, and the inequity of the system itself undermines population health.
The Affordable Care Act begins to realign the health system toward equity, and its opponents attack public financing for health care through Medicare and Medicaid, as well as other safety-net spending for social services.
Advocacy for successfully carrying out the law can and should extend to all forms of social supports that benefit the 99 percent, including supports for income, food sufficiency, environmental safety, education and transportation, as well as reducing social and economic discrimination.
ELLEN R. SHAFFER Director, Center for Policy Analysis San Francisco, Dec. 10, 2011
To the Editor:
Elizabeth H. Bradley and Lauren Taylor are correct that social programs to help the poor will improve overall health in the United States. There is robust data demonstrating that health care accounts for only about 20 percent of health outcomes; genes, 35 percent; and other influences, the rest. Poverty is clearly one adverse influence, but lifestyles are major determinants of how long and how well we live.
Smoking, diet, alcohol, drugs, guns (homicide, suicide), sexual behavior and so on are all crucially important. Money spent on government programs to make healthy choices the default will pay huge dividends and are very cost-effective. Even at the risk of being said to encourage a ''nanny state,'' they should become a financing focus for the next decade if we are to improve the health of the population.

The writer is a professor of medicine at Northwestern University and immediate past president of the Chicago Board of Health.
To the Editor:
Relying on government control at one end of the spectrum, or practicing laissez-faire at the other, are only temporary fixes to a deeper and more malignant disease process: How can the health care system empower the people to take more responsibility for their own health?

HEADLINE: Will China Break?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Consider the following picture: Recent growth has relied on a huge construction boom fueled by surging real estate prices, and exhibiting all the classic signs of a bubble. There was rapid growth in credit -- with much of that growth taking place not through traditional banking but rather through unregulated ''shadow banking'' neither subject to government supervision nor backed by government guarantees. Now the bubble is bursting -- and there are real reasons to fear financial and economic crisis.
Am I describing Japan at the end of the 1980s? Or am I describing America in 2007? I could be. But right now I'm talking about China, which is emerging as another danger spot in a world economy that really, really doesn't need this right now. 
I've been reluctant to weigh in on the Chinese situation, in part because it's so hard to know what's really happening. All economic statistics are best seen as a peculiarly boring form of science fiction, but China's numbers are more fictional than most. I'd turn to real China experts for guidance, but no two experts seem to be telling the same story.
Still, even the official data are troubling -- and recent news is sufficiently dramatic to ring alarm bells.
The most striking thing about the Chinese economy over the past decade was the way household consumption, although rising, lagged behind overall growth. At this point consumer spending is only about 35 percent of G.D.P., about half the level in the United States.
So who's buying the goods and services China produces? Part of the answer is, well, we are: as the consumer share of the economy declined, China increasingly relied on trade surpluses to keep manufacturing afloat. But the bigger story from China's point of view is investment spending, which has soared to almost half of G.D.P.
The obvious question is, with consumer demand relatively weak, what motivated all that investment? And the answer, to an important extent, is that it depended on an ever-inflating real estate bubble. Real estate investment has roughly doubled as a share of G.D.P. since 2000, accounting directly for more than half of the overall rise in investment. And surely much of the rest of the increase was from firms expanding to sell to the burgeoning construction industry.
Do we actually know that real estate was a bubble? It exhibited all the signs: not just rising prices, but also the kind of speculative fever all too familiar from our own experiences just a few years back -- think coastal Florida.
And there was another parallel with U.S. experience: as credit boomed, much of it came not from banks but from an unsupervised, unprotected shadow banking system. There were huge differences in detail: shadow banking American style tended to involve prestigious Wall Street firms and complex financial instruments, while the Chinese version tends to run through underground banks and even pawnshops. Yet the consequences were similar: in China as in America a few years ago, the financial system may be much more vulnerable than data on conventional banking reveal.
Now the bubble is visibly bursting. How much damage will it do to the Chinese economy -- and the world?
Some commentators say not to worry, that China has strong, smart leaders who will do whatever is necessary to cope with a downturn. Implied though not often stated is the thought that China can do what it takes because it doesn't have to worry about democratic niceties.
To me, however, these sound like famous last words. After all, I remember very well getting similar assurances about Japan in the 1980s, where the brilliant bureaucrats at the Ministry of Finance supposedly had everything under control. And later, there were assurances that America would never, ever, repeat the mistakes that led to Japan's lost decade -- when we are, in reality, doing even worse than Japan did.
For what it's worth, statements about economic policy from Chinese officials don't strike me as being especially clear-headed. In particular, the way China has been lashing out at foreigners -- among other things, imposing a punitive tariff on imports of U.S.-made autos that will do nothing to help its economy but will help poison trade relations -- does not sound like a mature government that knows what it's doing.
And anecdotal evidence suggests that while China's government may not be constrained by rule of law, it is constrained by pervasive corruption, which means that what actually happens at the local level may bear little resemblance to what is ordered in Beijing.
I hope that I'm being needlessly alarmist here. But it's impossible not to be worried: China's story just sounds too much like the crack-ups we've already seen elsewhere. And a world economy already suffering from the mess in Europe really, really doesn't need a new epicenter of crisis.

HEADLINE: Rules Stretched As Green Cards Go to Investors

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN and KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
Affluent foreigners are rushing to take advantage of a federal immigration program that offers them the chance to obtain a green card in return for investing in construction projects in the United States. With credit tight, the program has unexpectedly turned into a mainstay for the financing of these projects in New York, California, Texas and other states.
The number of foreign applicants, each of whom must invest at least $500,000 in a project, has nearly quadrupled in the last two years, to more than 3,800 in the 2011 fiscal year, officials said. Demand has grown so fast that the Obama administration, which is championing the program, is seeking to streamline the application process.
Still, some critics of the program have described it as an improper use of the immigration system to spur economic development -- a cash-for-visas scheme. And an examination of the program by The New York Times suggests that in New York, developers and state officials are stretching the rules to qualify projects for this foreign financing. 
These developers are often relying on gerrymandering techniques to create development zones that are supposedly in areas of high unemployment -- and thus eligible for special concessions -- but actually are in prosperous ones, according to federal and state records.
One of the more prominent projects is a 34-story glass tower in Manhattan that is to cost $750 million, one-fifth of which is to come from foreign investors seeking green cards. Called the International Gem Tower, it is rising near Fifth Avenue in the diamond district of Manhattan, one of the wealthiest areas in the country.
Yet through the selective use of census statistics, state officials have classified the area as one plagued by high unemployment, the federal and state records show. As a result, the developer has increased the project's chances of attracting foreigners who will accept little, if any, return on their investment in the project if it means they can secure American visas for their families.
A senior federal immigration official, Alejandro Mayorkas, acknowledged in an interview on Friday that the program might need more scrutiny. Mr. Mayorkas and other federal officials said they were concerned that some of the maps that New York and other states were approving might not adhere to the spirit and intent of the regulations.
The Times's review of the program in New York indicates that several other major projects are also based on questionable maps.
For example, the Battery Maritime Building, at the foot of Manhattan near Wall Street, has been classified as being located in an area that needs help attracting jobs. That designation is the result of a development zone whose outlines resemble a gerrymandered political district, project documents show.
The zone snakes up through the Lower East Side, skirting the wealthy enclaves of Battery Park City and TriBeCa, and then jumps across the East River to annex the Farragut Houses project in Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn.
In fact, the small census tract that contains the Farragut Houses has become a go-to area for developers seeking to use the visa program: its unemployed residents have been counted toward three projects already.
The giant Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn, which abuts well-heeled brownstone neighborhoods, has also qualified for the special concessions using a gerrymandered high-unemployment district: the crescent-shaped zone swings more than two miles to the northeast to include poor sections of Crown Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant. A local blogger and critic of Atlantic Yards, Norman Oder, has referred to the map as ''the Bed-Stuy Boomerang.''
Since 2008, developers have raised or have planned to raise close to $1 billion on these projects in New York City, according to federal and state records. Almost all of that money would come in increments of $500,000 -- much of it from residents of China -- and pour into wealthy areas.
In interviews, New York State economic-development officials praised the program but were reluctant to accept responsibility for administering it. Indeed, some state officials who certified projects for the program acknowledged that they did not know what was being built. They said they were following guidance from federal regulators.
''This program serves as a valuable tool to support job-creating projects that will put areas of high unemployment on a continued path to economic recovery and growth,'' said Austin Shafran, a spokesman for Empire State Development, the state agency that oversees the program in New York.
Urged on by federal and state officials, investors in faraway places like Shanghai and Seoul along with American developers have been flocking to the program, which was created by Congress during the recession of 1990.
Under the program, known as EB-5, investors receive a visa that provides residency for two years and can be converted into a permanent green card if the holders can show the investment produced at least 10 jobs, even if the project has not been completed.
With the surge in EB-5 projects, many lawyers and consultants, in the United States and overseas, are getting involved. In China alone, more than 500 agents are jockeying to connect wealthy Chinese people to American developers, experts said.
Investors throng EB-5 conferences. Many, successful in their own countries, said they wanted to secure American residency for their children. But the competition has given rise to unsavory practices, EB-5 lawyers and consultants said, like agents who falsely promise guaranteed returns.
The minimum investment in the program was set at $1 million and has not changed in more than 20 years. But if the project is in a rural area or a place where the unemployment rate is 50 percent above the national average, the threshold for investing is $500,000, not $1 million.
By creating development zones that are ruled eligible for $500,000 investments, urban developers are at an advantage in luring contributions.
The zone drawn up for the Gem Tower consists of two census tracts in Midtown Manhattan. According to census figures, the tract that contains the project had an unemployment rate of zero for the last five years.
But the State Labor Department calculated that there were enough unemployed people in an adjoining census tract -- one that includes Times Square -- to justify calling the small zone an area of high unemployment.
Lela Goren, director general of Extell New York Regional Center, which is helping to raise the EB-5 investments for the Gem Tower, said she could not explain how the tower's zone qualified as needy. ''It qualifies, whatever the numbers, and it got approved,'' Ms. Goren said.
The consultants arranging the EB-5 financing for the Battery Maritime and Atlantic Yards projects declined to comment.
Officials in other states expressed dismay over how New York developers were using the program. They said New York was unfairly siphoning off investments from less-developed areas.
''A lot of projects are in areas that are head-scratchers,'' said James Candido, an official with Vermont's Department of Economic Development.
Other states have sometimes not allowed such questionable development zones. California told a developer to relocate a manufacturing plant for a surgical-products company from a more prosperous part of San Jose to a poorer one, said Brook J. Taylor, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development in California.
Federal regulators said states determined whether projects were located in areas of ''greatest need.''
''The question is, are the state authorities adhering to the spirit of the law?'' said Mr. Mayorkas, the federal immigration official who is the director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. ''Where is the project being developed, and where are the jobs being created? Are the people from the areas of high unemployment being employed? Because that's really the purpose. If they're not being hired from those areas, then the question is justified.''
Mr. Mayorkas, whose staff has been scrambling to keep up with the boom in the program, said in the interview on Friday that he was concerned about allegations of gerrymandering.
If some project designations were not achieving ''legislative intent,'' he said, ''then I think that is something that we need to consider as the laws are reviewed.''

HEADLINE: Don't Tax the Rich. Tax Inequality Itself.

BYLINE: By IAN AYRES and AARON S. EDLIN. 
Ian Ayres, a professor of law at Yale, is the author of ''Carrots and Sticks: Unlock the Power of Incentives to Get Things Done.'' Aaron S. Edlin, a professor of law and of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, is co-editor of ''The Economists' Voice: Top Economists Take On Today's Problems.''

 BODY:
THE progressive reformer and eminent jurist Louis D. Brandeis once said, ''We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we cannot have both.'' Brandeis lived at a time when enormous disparities between the rich and the poor led to violent labor unrest and ultimately to a reform movement.
Over the last three decades, income inequality has again soared to the sort of levels that alarmed Brandeis. In 1980, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans made 9.1 percent of our nation's pre-tax income; by 2006 that share had risen to 18.8 percent -- slightly higher than when Brandeis joined the Supreme Court in 1916. 
Congress might have countered this increased concentration but, instead, tax changes have exacerbated the trend: in after-tax dollars, our wealthiest 1 percent over this same period went from receiving 7.7 percent to 16.3 percent of our nation's income.
What we call the Brandeis Ratio -- the ratio of the average income of the nation's richest 1 percent to the median household income -- has skyrocketed since Ronald Reagan took office. In 1980 the average 1-percenter made 12.5 times the median income, but in 2006 (the latest year for which data is available) the average income of our richest 1 percent was a whopping 36 times greater than that of the median household.
Brandeis understood that at some point the concentration of economic power could undermine the democratic requisite of dispersed political power. This concern looms large in today's America, where billionaires are allowed to spend unlimited amounts of money on their own campaigns or expressly advocating the election of others.
We believe that we have reached the Brandeis tipping point. It would be bad for our democracy if 1-percenters started making 40 or 50 times as much as the median American.
Enough is enough. Congress should reform our tax law to put the brakes on further inequality. Specifically, we propose an automatic extra tax on the income of the top 1 percent of earners -- a tax that would limit the after-tax incomes of this club to 36 times the median household income.
Importantly, our Brandeis tax does not target excessive income per se; it only caps inequality. Billionaires could double their current income without the tax kicking in -- as long as the median income also doubles. The sky is the limit for the rich as long as the ''rising tide lifts all boats.'' Indeed, the tax gives job creators an extra reason to make sure that corporate wealth does in fact trickle down.
Here's how the tax would work. Once a year, the Internal Revenue Service would calculate the Brandeis ratio of the previous year. If the average 1-percenter made more than 36 times the income of the median American household, then the I.R.S. would create a new tax bracket for the highest 1 percent of income and calculate a marginal income tax rate for that bracket sufficient to reduce the after-tax Brandeis ratio to 36.
This new tax, if triggered, would apply only to income in excess of the poorest 1-percenter -- currently about $330,000 per year. Our Brandeis tax is conservative in that it doesn't attempt to reverse the gains of the wealthy in the last 30 years. It is not a ''claw back'' tax. It merely assures that things don't get worse.
A key aspect of our proposal is the tax's automatic nature. Congress need only act once to protect our future. Just as our tax brackets automatically adjust with the inflation rate, Congress could specify nondiscretionary conditions under which the Brandeis tax would automatically go into effect.
Part of our goal is to change the way politicians speak about income equality. Framing the income of the wealthy in relation to the median income will help us all keep in mind the relative success of the middle class. Our grandparents would be shocked to learn that the average income of the 1-percent club has skyrocketed to more than 30 times the median income -- just as we will be shocked if 20 years from now 1-percenters make 80 times the median, which is where we will be if inequality continues to grow at the current rate unabated.
The Occupy Wall Street movement is right to decry the increasing power of the 1 percent as a threat to democracy. President Obama is right to characterize the present as a ''make-or-break moment'' for the middle class. As 1-percenters ourselves, we call on Congress, for the sake of democracy, to end the continued erosion of economic equality in our nation.

HEADLINE: Apple App Makers on Edge for Holidays

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
On Christmas morning, millions of people will unwrap new iPads, iPhones and iPod Touches -- and immediately start downloading games and other applications for them. It is the biggest day of the year for app sales, which can mean big money for developers.
That is, if they manage to get their apps through Apple's review process and into the App Store before everyone at Apple goes on vacation. 
Each year around Christmas, Apple stops accepting app submissions and updating its store for a while. This year the shutdown starts on Thursday and runs for eight days.
In the weeks leading up to the cutoff, developers often pull all-nighters so they can get their work to Apple in time.
''There's a mad scramble for developers,'' said Marc Edwards, lead designer at Bjango, an Australian app maker. ''In terms of money, it can be a really big deal.''
It is hard to begrudge Apple for wanting to give its employees a break. But the App Store freeze at Christmas, and the crunch time leading up to it, underscore Apple's power in the world of mobile apps and the lengths developers are willing to go to meet its demands.
In short, Apple is a powerful gatekeeper, and for more than a week it is keeping the gate closed.
''If you are a developer and want to sell an app for the iPhone, you have to go through Apple,'' said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research who tracks the wireless industry.
''That's not true of Android or most other outlets,'' he added. ''I can't think of another company that has such a dominant lock on the channel to sell to an audience.''
Android, the smartphone software made by Google, has the second-biggest app economy after Apple. And it does not have Apple's stringent and sometimes inscrutable board of testers and reviewers, who can reject any app that, in their judgment, does not meet the company's technical or content standards.
Android developers can sell their apps through a variety of third-party outlets like Amazon.com and GetJar, as well as the Google-run Android Marketplace, which is happy to accept new apps any day of the year.
But developers say that although Android phones are now bigger sellers than iPhones, it is still more lucrative to build apps for Apple products.
The stakes are higher than ever this year because AT&T is no longer the only carrier in the United States selling the iPhone, so there are more potential customers. Apple declined to comment on the App Store freeze.
Bryan Duke, a part-time app developer in Las Vegas, has seen firsthand how much of a difference one day can make.
One of his apps is an air hockey game that costs 99 cents and usually averages about 300 downloads a day. But on Christmas Day last year there were 1,834. Apple keeps 30 percent of the revenue.
''It's typical to see a jump on any major holiday, but Christmas is the biggest one,'' Mr. Duke said. ''I'm certainly hoping for a nice big Christmas bump this year.''
Flurry, a mobile analytics firm, estimated that in the period from Dec. 23 to Dec. 26 last year, 240 million applications were downloaded to Apple mobile devices, or about 20 percent of the total downloads for the month.
The promise of a Christmas bonanza was enough to motivate David Barnard, the founder of App Cubby, a developer in Austin, Tex., to jump into creating a notifications app, just days before the deadline.
Mr. Barnard and his small team have built apps like Tweet Speaker, which reads Twitter messages aloud, and Mirror, which turns the iPhone screen into a mirror with the help of the front-facing camera.
''If we can get that snowball rolling and get it right, we can ride the momentum,'' he said. ''We're going to give it a shot.''
John Shahidi, chief executive of RockLive, a mobile application developer in Los Angeles, said his company started working on a soccer game in August, with an eye toward Christmas.
''We needed the extra time as insurance to make sure that we are visible in the App Store and have time for any updates,'' he said. Inevitably, though, there was a rush at the end. ''I can't tell you the last time I've slept eight hours,'' he said.
Although RockLive's app, called Heads Up, sailed through Apple's review process and went on sale this month, Mr. Shahidi said he was keeping an eye out for any bugs or problems that might require a software update. Fixes also need to be submitted before Thursday to have a chance of clearing Apple's hurdles in time.
Otherwise, a flawed application could lead to bad user reviews in the App Store, causing sales to suffer.
It is not just the smaller developers that are hoping to profit from the Christmas rush. Big software makers, which have more flexibility in pricing, develop strategies like putting some applications on sale and pushing out fancy new ones to attract downloads.
Electronics Arts, the giant game company that sells titles like Tetris and The Sims for Apple devices, said it was offering 36 new games and updates for the holidays, including The Sims FreePlay.
Steven Stamstad, vice president for global marketing at the company, said it started planning 18 to 24 months in advance to make sure it capitalized on the season.
Mr. Stamstad compared the company's preparations to the way the movie studios planned for summer blockbusters. ''We do a considerable amount of planning in terms of development, launches and putting items on sale,'' he said.
Some developers simply prefer to avoid the nail-biting stress of trying to get into the store before the shutdown, then hoping nothing goes wrong and that their app gets noticed amid the hundreds of other new ones flooding the market.
''In my experience it's a good thing to avoid launching at Christmas, because a lot of the big companies are launching games,'' said Oliver Cameron, who is working on an address book application called Everyme. ''It's easy to get drowned out in the store.''
Instead, Mr. Cameron said he planned to wait until the relative quiet of early January.

HEADLINE: After Yearlong Competition, Mayor Is Said to Pick Cornell for Science School

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg plans to announce on Monday that he has chosen Cornell University to create a new science graduate school on Roosevelt Island, capping an intense yearlong competition in his ambitious bid to spur a boom in New York City's high-tech sector. 
For the mayor, it is a chance to leave a lasting legacy that he hopes will make the city a world leader in computer engineering and transform the city's economy. For Cornell, it could mean a chance to be the kind of incubator for new businesses -- and the lucrative patents that come with them -- that Stanford University has been in California and M.I.T. in Massachusetts, and to elevate its already-prestigious engineering and computer science programs to the uppermost ranks.
The announcement, to take place at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center on the Upper East Side, according to people briefed on the plan, will come three days after Stanford pulled out of the contest, and Cornell announced a $350 million gift, the largest in its history, to help bankroll its proposal.
Speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the matter publicly, those briefed said that Cornell had long before emerged as the front-runner. ''It was already very much along the way to this result,'' one said.
Still, they said, the mayor may not have ruled out the possibility of anointing two winners: the other contenders are Columbia University, a consortium led by New York University, and Carnegie Mellon.
Cornell proposed a campus with 2.1 million square feet of building space at a cost of more than $2 billion, accommodating more than 2,000 students, with classrooms, laboratories, housing and a conference center, among other facilities. The project, to be built over a generation, would include a range of unusual environmental features, like heavy use of solar energy and geothermal wells.
City officials had originally planned to choose a winner by year's end. But after seeing the voluminous proposals submitted on Oct. 28, they warned not to expect an announcement until January, so the timing of Monday's announcement was a bit of a surprise.
Yet Cornell is in a hurry: it has promised to have classes running by next September, a year ahead of the date the city had requested.
''There's a lot of work to do, and a real desire to get things rolling in the time the mayor has left in office,'' one person briefed on the plan said.
The city is providing the land on Roosevelt Island, currently occupied by a little-used hospital, as well as $100 million in infrastructure improvements to ease building.
Stanford, seen as an early front-runner, balked at meeting some of the city's conditions during negotiations in recent weeks. City officials also said it was not clear that Stanford's entire team -- administration, faculty and alumni -- was as wholeheartedly behind the project as Cornell's people were, measured in part by Cornell's ability to raise money for it.

HEADLINE: De Blasio Backs Wage Bill In a Challenge to Quinn

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
With the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, courting business leaders as she prepares to run for mayor, Bill de Blasio, the public advocate and one of her chief rivals, has thrown his support behind a much-disputed bill that would increase wages for workers in city-subsidized development projects -- a move that could force Ms. Quinn to take a position on the issue.
In a letter that he sent to both Ms. Quinn and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Sunday evening, Mr. de Blasio wrote that New York City was not doing enough to expand economic opportunities and that the so-called living wage bill represented an ''immediate and important'' step the city could take. 
''The desperate state of New York City's middle class, the experience of other localities, and improvements made to the bill in recent months have collectively convinced me that the time has come to pass a living wage bill that uses the power of our economic development dollars to reduce income inequality,'' Mr. de Blasio wrote in the letter.
The legislation would require that employees who work in projects that receive aid from the city be paid at least $10 an hour with benefits, or $11.50 an hour without benefits. The state minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.
The bill is supported by a majority of the City Council, as well as by labor unions and members of the clergy, but opposed by business groups and by Mr. Bloomberg. Ms. Quinn, who can effectively kill legislation by not bringing it to a vote, has not said if she supports the measure.
The wage debate has put her in something of a political vise. She began her career as a housing advocate, but as she prepares a mayoral campaign, she has tried to convince leaders of the business community that she will be a centrist, pro-business mayor in the mold of Mr. Bloomberg.
In a statement late Sunday night, Jamie McShane, a spokesman for Ms. Quinn said, ''We've received the public advocate's letter late this evening. We're going to review it and we appreciate his input.''
Apart from John C. Liu, the city comptroller, whose mayoral prospects are seen as having been dimmed by an investigation into his fund-raising practices, Mr. de Blasio is the only one of Ms. Quinn's likely Democratic primary opponents so far to come out in favor of the wage bill.
In an interview, he said he was swayed not by political calculus, but by discussions over two months with both advocates and opponents of the measure. Among the things that struck him most, he said, was that opponents did not offer any ideas on how to address income inequality. The wage measure, while imperfect, at least represented a step in that direction, he added.
Mr. de Blasio in the letter did urge one change to the bill -- increasing the amount of annual revenue, from $5 million, that a business must earn to cause the requirement to kick in. That, he said, would protect smaller businesses.
In recent weeks, two powerful labor unions, 1199 SEIU, which represents health care workers, and the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council, have expressed support.
Ms. Quinn held a hearing last month on the bill, but has not yet scheduled a final hearing or a vote.
''I think it's time to move it forward,'' Mr. de Blasio said.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 21, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in some editions on Monday about a decision by the New York City public advocate, Bill de Blasio, to support the so-called living wage bill before the City Council erroneously included an organization among those that supported it. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York has not taken a position on the bill.

PERSON: Kim Jong-il 

HEADLINE: Kim Jong-il, Dictator Who Turned North Korea Into a Nuclear State, Dies

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Choe Sang-hun contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Called the ''Dear Leader'' by his people, Kim Jong-il presided with an iron hand over a country he kept on the edge of starvation and collapse, fostering perhaps the last personality cult in the Communist world even as he banished citizens deemed disloyal to gulags or sent assassins after defectors.
He came to power after the death in 1994 of his father, Kim Il-sung, North Korea's founder. His inheritance was an impoverished country with an uncertain place in a post-cold-war era. He played his one card, his nuclear weapons program, brilliantly, first defying efforts by the administration of George W. Bush to push his country over the brink, then exploiting America's distraction with the war in Iraq to harvest enough nuclear fuel from his main nuclear reactor at Yongbyon to produce the fuel for six to eight weapons.
Throughout, he remained an unknowable figure. Everything about him was guesswork, from the exact date and place of his birth to the mythologized events of his rise in a country formed by the hasty division of the Korean Peninsula at the end of World War II. 
North Koreans heard about him only as their ''peerless leader'' and ''the great successor to the revolutionary cause.'' His portrait hangs beside that of his father, Kim Il-sung, in every North Korean household and building. Towers, banners and even rock faces across the country bear slogans praising him.
Mr. Kim was a source of fascination inside the Central Intelligence Agency, which interviewed his mistresses, tried to track his whereabouts and psychoanalyzed his motives. And he was an object of parody in American culture.
Short and round, he wore elevator shoes, oversize sunglasses and a bouffant hairdo -- a Hollywood stereotype of the wacky post-cold-war dictator. Mr. Kim himself was fascinated by film. He orchestrated the kidnapping of an actress and a director, both of them South Koreans, in an effort to build a domestic movie industry. He was said to keep a personal library of 20,000 foreign films, including the complete James Bond series, his favorite. But he rarely saw the outside world, save from the windows of his luxury train, which occasionally took him to China.
He was derided and denounced. President George W. Bush called him a ''pygmy'' and included his country in the ''axis of evil.'' Children's books in South Korea depicted him as a red devil with horns and fangs. Yet those who met him were surprised by his serious demeanor and his knowledge of events beyond the hermit kingdom he controlled.
''He was a very outspoken person,'' said Roh Moo-hyun, who as South Korea's president met Mr. Kim in Pyongyang in 2007. ''He was the most flexible man in North Korea.''
Wendy Sherman, now the No. 3 official in the State Department, who served as counselor to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and accompanied her to North Korea, said in 2008: ''He was smart, engaged, knowledgeable, self-confident, sort of the master-director of all he surveyed.''
Ms. Albright met Mr. Kim in October 2000 in what turned out to be a futile effort to strike a deal with North Korea over limiting its missile program before President Bill Clinton left office.
''There was no denying the dictatorial state that he ruled,'' Ms. Sherman said. ''There was no denying the freedoms that didn't exist. But at the time, there were a lot of questions in the U.S. about whether he was really in control, and we left with no doubt that he was.''
When Ms. Albright and Ms. Sherman sat down to talk through a 14-point list of concerns about North Korea's missile program, ''he didn't know the answers to every question, but he knew a lot more than most leaders would -- and he was a conceptual thinker,'' Ms. Sherman added.
A Deal With Washington
President Bush said during his first term in office that he would never tolerate a nuclear North Korea, but as his presidency wound down, many of his aides believed he did exactly that.
It was not until the spring of 2007 that Mr. Bush was told by the Israelis that North Korea was helping Syria build a nuclear reactor; before the Syrians or the North Koreans were confronted with that evidence, Israel sent bombers on a secret mission to destroy the Syrian plant. The North Koreans have never explained their role.
By the time Mr. Bush left office, the administration had moved from four years of confrontation with the North to three years of halting negotiations. Led by Christopher R. Hill, a veteran American diplomat, the negotiations resulted in a deal that hawks hated: the United States agreed to supply North Korea with large amounts of fuel oil in return for the dismantlement of the aging Yongbyon plant, described by inspectors as a radioactive accident waiting to happen.
Mr. Kim played a weak hand very well. He succeeded in fending off pressure from Washington and Beijing, and forcing Washington to talk with him and ultimately to haggle with him. He chopped up and dragged out negotiations, holding on to his nuclear fuel and whatever weapons he had produced, giving him continued leverage. It is that arsenal that now worries American and Asian officials, who fear that plotting generals and party leaders may fight to control it as they pick Mr. Kim's successor.
''When the history of this era is written,'' said Graham Allison, a Harvard professor and expert on proliferation, ''the scorecard will be Kim 8, Bush 0.''
But if ''he was the greatest master of survival, against all odds,'' said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul, ''it was his own people who paid the price, and the price was pretty high.''
Mr. Kim's policy of songun, or ''army first,'' lavished the country's scarce resources on the military, at 1.1 million-strong the world's fifth largest. During his rule, the North expanded its ballistic missile arsenal and, in October 2006, became the eighth country in the world to conduct a nuclear test.
But as the North's economy shrank, its isolation deepened. Possibly as many as 2 million people -- almost 10 percent of the population -- died in a famine in the mid-to-late 1990s brought on by incompetence and natural disasters.
''Do not expect me to change!'' is a popular catchphrase credited to Mr. Kim and used to exhort his people to remain loyal to his socialist ways.
Mr. Kim is believed to have been born in Siberia in 1941, when his father, Kim Il-sung, was in exile in the Soviet Union. But in North Korea's official accounts, he was born in 1942, in a cabin, Abe Lincoln-like. The cabin was in a secret camp of anti-Japanese guerrillas his father commanded on Mount Paektu, a holy piece of land in Korean mythology. The event, the official Korean Central News Agency would often say, was accompanied by the appearance of a bright star in the sky and a double-rainbow that touched the earth.
Little is known of his upbringing, apart from the official statement that he graduated in 1964 from Kim Il-sung University, one of the country's many monuments to his father. At the time, North Korea was enmeshed in the cold war, and the younger Kim watched many crises unfold from close up, including North Korea's seizure of the Pueblo, an American spy ship, in 1968. He appeared episodically at state events, rarely speaking. When he did, he revealed a high-pitched voice and little of his father's easygoing charisma.
In his youth and middle age, there were stories about his playboy lifestyle. There were tales of lavish meals at a time his country was starving -- his cook wrote a book after leaving the country -- and his wavy hair and lifted heels, along with a passion for top-label liquor, made him the butt of jokes.
There was also speculation that he was involved in the 1983 bombing of a South Korean political delegation in Burma, and that he had known of, and perhaps had ordered, the kidnapping of Japanese citizens. Nothing was proved.
Washington put North Korea on its list of state sponsors of terrorism after North Korean agents planted a bomb that blew up a South Korean passenger jet in 1987 -- under instructions from Mr. Kim, according to one of the agents, who was caught alive.
Mr. Kim campaigned for power relentlessly. He bowed to his father at the front porch each morning and offered to put the shoes on the father's feet long before he was elected to the Politburo, at age 32, in 1974, according to a 2006 memoir by Hwang Jang-yop, a former North Korean Workers' Party secretary who was a key aide for the Kim regime before his defection to Seoul in 1997. (Mr. Hwang died in 2010.)
''At an early age, Kim Jong-il mastered the mechanics of power,'' Mr. Hwang wrote in the memoir.
It was not until 1993, as the existence of the Yongbyon nuclear plant and North Korea's nuclear weapons ambitions became publicly known, that Mr. Kim appeared to be his father's undisputed successor. That year, he became head of the National Defense Commission, the North's most powerful agency, in charge of the military.
In 1994, in a showdown with the United States, North Korea threatened to turn its stockpile of nuclear fuel into bombs. It was the closest the two countries came to war since the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. The standoff was defused when Kim Il-sung welcomed former President Jimmy Carter, who pushed Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kim into a deal.
Within a month, however, the country's founder and Great Leader was dead. Many doubted at the time that the younger Kim would take over. There were rumors of a military coup, and theories that he would be allowed to keep his fast cars and to consort with visiting European ''entertainers'' as long as he did not try to run the country. Like much intelligence about North Korea, that turned out to be wrong.
Mr. Kim has three sons, any of whom could potentially have succeeded him. But his home life is a mystery.
His oldest son, Kim Jong-nam, would have been the natural choice to succeed him. But he had a handicap: his mother never married Mr. Kim. Since his health crisis, in 2008, Mr. Kim had been grooming his third son, Kim Jong-un, believed to be in his late 20s, to be his successor. Reports from North Korea on Monday suggested that Kim Jong-un was in charge.
Mr. Kim consolidated power in the late 1990s, and flexed his muscle by testing a North Korean missile over Japan, sending that much larger and more powerful nation into a panic. It was through episodes like this that Mr. Kim learned true power: that he could blackmail his way to survival.
But he could not learn to feed his own people, and his country became even more dependent on China for food and fuel and on ''humanitarian'' donations from South Korea and the United States. In June 2000, Mr. Kim played host in Pyongyang, the North's capital, to the first summit meeting with a South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, since the peninsula was divided more than five decades before.
Pressuring Pyongyang
The South Korean leader received the Nobel Peace Prize later that year, though his reputation was soon tainted by revelations that a South Korean company had paid off the North Koreans, and presumably their leader, to arrange the trip.
Once President Bush took office in January 2001, all cooperation between Washington and Seoul over how to deal with the North came to a crashing halt. Mr. Bush rejected the South's ''sunshine policy'' of engagement with North Korea, and ended Clinton-era talks that he viewed as dangerous appeasement.
A concerted effort began to push North Korea over the brink, and set off an uprising against Kim Jong-il's leadership. To the degree Washington could, it cut off North Korean trade, its access to cash and its ability to export weapons and drugs. Mr. Bush called Mr. Kim a ''tyrant'' who ''starves his own people.''
In October 2002, the administration presented North Korea with evidence that it had secretly tried to evade the 1994 nuclear agreement with the United States by purchasing equipment to enrich uranium from Abdul Qadeer Khan, a founder of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. The evidence was strong -- the United States had tracked the shipments with spy satellites -- but the C.I.A. overstated its confidence that the North was building separate, secret nuclear facilities.
That led to a confrontation that changed the nature of the North Korean threat. Mr. Kim ordered the ouster of United Nations inspectors who had been stationed at Yongbyon. The United States pressed for an end to fuel shipments to the North. In retaliation, from January through March 2003, just as the United States military was barreling toward the invasion of Iraq, Mr. Kim did what his father had come so very close to doing nine years before: he announced that he was reprocessing spent fuel rods into bomb fuel.
After the invasion of Iraq, Mr. Kim was not seen for nearly two months; there were reports that he had gone into hiding, thinking he was Mr. Bush's next target. He emerged only to start another confrontation in 2006, first with a series of missile tests, then, in October, the North's first nuclear test.
Some Asian and American officials interpreted Mr. Kim's decision as a fit of pique because ''six-party talks'' -- negotiations among North Korea, China, South Korea, Russia, the United States and Japan -- were moving so slowly. Others said that Mr. Kim had simply learned from Saddam Hussein's mistakes and determined that he would never face the United States without a nuclear weapon.
The test itself was something of a fizzle; it ended with a sub-kiloton explosion, less than a tenth of the power of the bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. But Mr. Kim had made his point. He was condemned in the United Nations, and China briefly cut off oil and other trade. But within months the United States agreed on a new series of negotiations.
While there were many starts and stops, and disagreements over what it means to fully dismantle a nuclear program, in the summer of 2007 Mr. Kim agreed to stop the production of new nuclear fuel at Yongbyon. By then he presumably had all the weapons he needed.
The plant began to be dismantled, and in the summer of 2008 the Bush administration talked about starting up with Mr. Kim on the hardest negotiations of all, over the price of giving up North Korea's nuclear arsenal. He died before the talks could seriously begin. .
As soon as President Obama came into office, Mr. Kim ordered a second nuclear test, this one more successful than the first. And he waited out the predictable hail of international condemnation. The move aborted efforts by Mr. Obama to engage with the North Koreans. And the next three years were spent with the United States and South Korea demanding the North live up to the denuclearization pledges it made during the Bush administration.
Instead, it did the opposite. In November 2010, the North Koreans showed a visiting American scientist from Stanford University, Siegfried Hecker, an apparently working uranium enrichment plant that the country had been building for years, and that the C.I.A. had missed, though the agency had been right about other secret facilities. The plant gave North Korea a new way to produce nuclear weapons, even as his people fell into another food shortage.
The same year, the North made two attacks against the South Korean military, sinking a ship and later shelling an island near Northern waters. The episodes caused the United States and South Korea to conduct new joint exercises, even while the Chinese, apparently fearing a complete collapse of the North Korean regime, increased its economic aid.
Despite his ill health, he was reported to have visited one of the units that attacked the South, to hand out medals, and recently managed one last visit to his benefactors in China. But it is unclear whether his son and presumed successor accompanied him on the trip.

HEADLINE: States of Conflict: A Final Update

BYLINE: By IAN LIVINGSTON, MICHAEL E. O'HANLON and AMY UNIKEWICZ

 BODY:
A VERSION of this chart has been appearing in the Op-Ed pages every few months for eight years. The first was published eight months after the invasion of Iraq, and data from the conflicts in Afghanistan and Pakistan were added in more recent years. Gains have been made in these three countries, but violence persists and peace is by no means assured. Nonetheless, with the end of the war in Iraq officially announced last week, this will be the last of the series.
Of the three, Iraq has presented the most extreme swings. In the months after the invasion, the country was relatively quiet -- at least on the surface -- but then it exploded in violence. Since 2007, however, war-related violence has declined more than tenfold, even as the role of United States forces has gradually shrunk. That, along with accelerating economic progress, is the good news. The bad news is that violence persists. Politics remain unstable and there are signs of increasing sectarian division. This fall, the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a Shiite, summarily arrested hundreds of former Baathists, many of them Sunnis. Fewer than 40 percent of Iraqis say they are hopeful about the future. 
Pakistan has seen some slight political progress since the military dictatorship ended in 2008. And the rise of the Pakistani Taliban appears to have been checked by the Pakistani Army. But extremist violence and assassinations continue, and civilian control of the country is weak. A recession -- set off by the financial crisis in the United States -- has set back the country's economic trajectory. And elements in the government and security service appear to be playing a double, if not triple, game in Afghanistan. The United States has less and less confidence that Pakistan can be viewed as an ally.
Afghanistan was relatively peaceful in 2003, when the recently deposed Taliban had yet to start a full-fledged insurgency. Since then the country has returned to a state of war. President George W. Bush, and to a greater extent President Obama, responded with a major increase in troop levels. The fruits of those efforts are finally emerging -- nationwide, there were 20 percent fewer insurgent attacks in the latter part of 2011 than in the same months of 2010. But that statistic masks the fact that, in the east of the country near the Pakistani border, there were actually 20 percent more insurgent attacks in that period. And a culture of corruption -- which American aid has often inadvertently reinforced -- continues to infect almost every sector of business and government. Nonetheless, the average Afghan's quality of life has improved. And the Afghan Army is increasingly competent, though still relatively small.
Finally, Al Qaeda writ large is much weaker than it was eight years ago. More than half of its top leaders have been arrested or killed -- including, this year, Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki. But we must keep a wary eye on it, as well as on related terrorist groups, like the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba.
On balance, it has been an extremely painful and costly decade. But it does seem possible to conclude, with cautious optimism, that America is somewhat safer. And we are certainly closer than ever to ending our current round of overseas wars.

HEADLINE: Pakistani Strains Prompt Leader to Race Home

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT and SALMAN MASOOD

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- A tense showdown between Pakistan's powerful army and its besieged civilian government brought President Asif Ali Zardari hurrying back from Dubai early on Monday, after weeks of growing concerns by his supporters that the military has been moving to strengthen its role in the country's governance.
Pushed by the army, a Pakistani Supreme Court hearing set to begin on Monday will investigate whether Mr. Zardari's government was behind an unsigned memorandum that surfaced in October, purportedly asking the Obama administration's help to curb the military's influence and avert a possible coup in the wake of the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May.
The case has brought tensions between Pakistan's military and its civilian leaders to perhaps its highest pitch since Mr. Zardari was elected three years ago. And it may also complicate America's efforts to bring its relationship with Pakistan out of crisis after the Bin Laden raid and American airstrikes last month that killed 26 on the Pakistani side of the border with Afghanistan. That roiling period of dispute has also strengthened the military's hand in the country's affairs. 
''The military and civilian leadership are on a collision course,'' said Talat Masood, a political analyst and retired lieutenant general.
Soon after the memo became public, the army demanded that the government investigate allegations that the memo was orchestrated by Husain Haqqani, then Pakistan's ambassador to the United States and a close aide to Mr. Zardari -- a charge Mr. Haqqani denied as he was recalled from his post. Opposition lawmakers quickly joined the chorus calling for action, and message records appearing to implicate the ambassador were leaked to the news media.
The civilian government denies having anything to do with the memo and warned that Parliament, the media, the civil society and the international community would not tolerate a military dictatorship in Pakistan. But in a filing to the Supreme Court last week, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the Pakistani Army chief, asked the court to investigate the controversial memo and its origins fully, saying it ''unsuccessfully attempted to lower the morale of the Pakistan Army.''
Adding to the political drama has been the absence of Mr. Zardari, 56, who unexpectedly left the country on Dec. 6 for medical treatment and was recuperating at his home in Dubai from what his doctor called strokelike symptoms. Associates of Mr. Zardari's said he returned to Karachi to confront the allegations and possible efforts to deem him physically or mentally unfit to keep his job. Some Pakistani analysts also questioned whether civilian officials had secretly cut a deal to concede to the military broader influence over the nation's affairs beyond foreign and national security policy.
Beginning Monday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments from lawyers from all sides and could decide to dismiss the matter if it finds no merit. More likely, however, is that the court will appoint a special commission to investigate what the news media here have dubbed Memogate, a process that could last weeks or months, inflicting more political pain on Mr. Zardari.
The Pakistani military's frayed relationship with the United States may also be contributing to the shift between the military and the civilian government here, giving the generals a freer hand to expand their role in running Pakistan's affairs beyond foreign and national security policy, even if from behind the scenes.
''The military sees the NATO airstrike as an opportunity to effect a comeback from the loss of face from the Bin Laden raid,'' said Ali Dayan Hasan, Pakistan director for Human Rights Watch in Lahore. ''But they're also tapping into genuine public anger and resentment against the Americans, and that's shrinking the space the Zardari government has to operate in and expanding the influence the military already has.''
The conflicting positions before the Supreme Court have laid bare deep civilian-military tensions that have stewed since Mr. Zardari took office in September 2008, an accidental ascent for a man known more as a wheeler-dealer than a leader. After the assassination of his wife, Benazir Bhutto, in December 2007, the Bush administration threw its reluctant support behind Mr. Zardari and his pledge to be a willing partner in combating terrorism.
It was not long before Mr. Zardari was on the outs with the military, as revealed in diplomatic cables made public last year by WikiLeaks, the antisecrecy organization.
Mr. Zardari, who spent 11 years in prison on ultimately unproved corruption charges, feared for his position and possibly his life. In one cable, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. told Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain in March 2009 that Mr. Zardari had told him that the ''ISI director and Kayani will take me out.'' The ISI is the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, the country's powerful spy agency.
Mr. Zardari's suspicions were not groundless. In another cable, General Kayani told the United States ambassador at the time, Anne W. Patterson, that he ''might, however reluctantly,'' pressure Mr. Zardari to resign and presumably leave Pakistan.
Over its 64-year history Pakistan has had several army coups and meddling by the military behind the scenes to engineer pliant governments, often with the support of the judiciary.
But most Pakistani analysts and Western diplomats said in the past week that a military coup now was unlikely. The generals, frustrated as they are with what they view as a corrupt, incompetent civilian administration, have no appetite for taking over the country at a time of a plunging economy, severe energy shortages and rising extremism, these officials said. After an unusual three-hour meeting here on Friday night with General Kayani, Pakistan's prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, dismissed reports of a standoff with the generals. But analysts and some government officials said that the split between the military and the civilian government was likely to widen in the coming days.
''Two different positions are taken by the army and the civilian government,'' said one government official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the dispute. ''Both can't be right or wrong at the same time. The confrontation is now at a very acute level.''
The dispute has caused a media frenzy. On Friday, Express, a popular Urdu daily newspaper, led its Web site with an article whose headline blazed: ''Army and Government Face to Face.''
The military has already managed to oust Mr. Haqqani, who was forced to resign as ambassador on Nov. 22 after accusations by a Pakistani-American businessman, Mansoor Ijaz, that Mr. Haqqani had masterminded the memo, a charge that he stoutly denies. Adm. Mike Mullen, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has acknowledged receiving the memo but said he ignored it as not credible.
The Pakistani newspaper Dawn said Friday in an editorial: ''Mr. Zardari needs to return to Pakistan to try and calm nerves and quell speculation that refuses to die down. Like it or not, the reality of Pakistan is that threats to the democratic process do lurk in the shadows.''
Some Pakistani and Western officials said last week that if Mr. Zardari returned, it could be only for a cameo appearance before Dec. 27, the fourth anniversary of the death of Ms. Bhutto, the two-time former prime minister, in a gun and bomb attack in the city of Rawalpindi, near Islamabad.
After that, Mr. Zardari would probably leave for a long -- perhaps permanent -- convalescence in London or Dubai, the officials said. By early Monday, neither Mr. Zardari nor his aides had signaled how long he would stay.
''The president is, thankfully, fit and healthy, and that is why he has returned,'' Shazia Marri, information minister for Sindh Province, of which Karachi is the capital, told Reuters. ''However, his activities over the next few days will depend on what the doctors advise.''

HEADLINE: As Gingrich's Star Rises, So Do G.O.P. Concerns

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- From the House that Newt Gingrich once ran through the Washington establishment to state capitals across the nation, some Republicans are going public with their concerns that Mr. Gingrich would be a weak general election candidate and a drag on the party's fortunes if he won the presidential nomination.
''Since we don't know how he got here, I don't know how he can be stopped,'' said Ed Rogers, a longtime Washington lobbyist and party strategist who worked for the first President George Bush. 
Mr. Rogers, who has not endorsed anyone, is like many in the party who esteem Mr. Gingrich for his achievement in leading Republicans to the control of Congress in 1994, after 40 years in the House minority, but who recoil from the prospect of him at the top of the ticket given the controversy, scandal and electoral defeats that defined his four years as speaker.
Late Saturday, former Senator Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican nominee, endorsed Mitt Romney, whose campaign is now anticipating a long and hard-fought nominating battle against Mr. Gingrich. Last week, Mr. Romney won the endorsement of Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolinawhich holds the first Southern primary, on Jan. 21.
Mr. Gingrich's team has dismissed the criticism as coming from Romney supporters, and has pointed to grass-roots support for his candidacy. For all the anxiety about him, from establishment Republicans to Tea Party conservatives, he has surged in polls nationwide and in the early voting states. Many voters say they have been persuaded by his combative, confident and learned performances in 13 Republican debates that Mr. Gingrich could best take on President Obama.
Yet some Republicans on Capitol Hill say that Mr. Gingrich would not only lose to Mr. Obama, but that he could take other Republican candidates down, too, in a year when high unemployment has driven hopes within the party of capturing the White House and the Senate while holding control of the House.
Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican who served in the House when Mr. Gingrich was speaker, has been an outspoken critic. ''I've had any number of members of Congress come over to me and thank me for what I'm saying,'' he said. ''They say, 'This guy is going to kill us if he gets the nomination.' ''
Mr. Gingrich was ''a disaster'' as speaker and most likely would be as a nominee, Mr. King said, given his ''compulsion to exaggerate,'' erratically changing ideas, intellectual arrogance and the grandiosity of his self-comparisons to the likes of Winston Churchill and others.
Representative Charles Bass, a New Hampshire Republican who was elected in the Gingrich-led wave of 1994, agreed. He recently endorsed Mr. Romney.
''I don't see Speaker Gingrich having appeal with the independent vote, which is the largest vote in my state and it's obviously my base along with the Republican vote,'' Mr. Bass said -- suggesting his own vulnerability if Mr. Gingrich heads the ticket.
''There's nothing about Speaker Gingrich that looks any more disciplined than he was in the 1990s,'' said Terry Nelson, formerly a top campaign strategist for President George W. Bush and Senator John McCain who is neutral after having worked for Tim Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor who quit the race in August.
Mr. Nelson recalled that Mr. Bush built his 2000 campaign on the promise to be ''a different kind of Republican'' -- different, among other things, from the Gingrich-led Republicans in Congress. And for all Mr. Gingrich's controversies back then, ''the whole period since his speakership has yet to be explored,'' Mr. Nelson said.
Already Mr. Gingrich has had to defend his lucrative consulting work for Freddie Mac, the housing finance giant, and his previous positions on global warming and for an individual health insurance mandate.
As thoroughly as Mr. Gingrich was covered as speaker, such vetting ''would increase 100-fold'' were he the nominee, Mr. Nelson said. ''So you have to wonder -- since he's so voluble about his thoughts -- would that be an effective way to run for president? I think not.''
Stuart Rothenberg, an independent analyst of Congressional races, said that Mr. Gingrich could hurt other Republicans running next year. ''There are some Republican insiders I talk to who think it would be a full-fledged blowout,'' he said.
Some of the anxiety also reflects Mr. Gingrich's failure so far to build a campaign organization.
''The fact that he has no infrastructure scares me to death,'' said a party chairman in a battleground state, who asked not to be named given his need to remain neutral.
''Our job is to work hand in hand with the nominee and his people to turn out every persuadable, likely Republican voter that we can,'' the party chairman said, recalling how the weak and late-starting McCain organization in 2008 handicapped Republicans against the Obama campaign.
''How do we make sure this train wreck doesn't happen?'' he added. ''That's the conversation among the politicos.''
Greatly stoking the concerns of Mr. Gingrich's Republican critics is that there is little time to alter the political dynamic before the critical first nominating contests because the Christmas and New Year's holidays will limit campaigning. ''The holiday calendar is his friend,'' said Mr. Rogers, the party strategist. ''As the holidays are about to distract everybody, there isn't a G.O.P. star chamber of the elite few that really run the show behind the scenes. I wish there were.''
Some Tea Party conservatives have even begun talking of a brokered Republican convention in August to push for a candidate they feel is more conservative.
''What is amazing is how many people feel this way,'' said Adam Brandon, a spokesman for FreedomWorks, a group affiliated with the Tea Party movement. ''If you had a concerted effort, someone could force a brokered convention. The hard part is finding the right person.''

HEADLINE: Buyout Profits Keep Flowing to Romney

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE, CHRISTOPHER DREW and JULIE CRESWELL; Peter Lattman and Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Almost 13 years ago, Mitt Romney left Bain Capital, the successful private equity firm he had helped start, and moved to Utah to rescue the Salt Lake City Olympic Games and begin a second career in public life.
Yet when it came to his considerable personal wealth, Mr. Romney never really left Bain.
In what would be the final deal of his private equity career, he negotiated a retirement agreement with his former partners that has paid him a share of Bain's profits ever since, bringing the Romney family millions of dollars in income each year and bolstering the fortune that has helped finance Mr. Romney's political aspirations.
The arrangement allowed Mr. Romney to pursue his career in public life while enjoying much of the financial upside of being a Bain partner as the company grew into a global investing behemoth. 
In the process, Bain continued to buy and restructure companies, potentially leaving Mr. Romney exposed to further criticism that he has grown wealthier over the last decade partly as a result of layoffs. Moreover, much of his income from the arrangement has probably qualified for a lower tax rate than ordinary income under a tax provision favorable to hedge fund and private equity managers, which has become a point of contention in the battle over economic inequality.
An examination of Mr. Romney's public financial disclosures, as well as interviews with former Bain partners, business associates and counselors to his campaign, reveals the extent of his financial relationship with Bain Capital and how it has allowed him to continue amassing a personal fortune while building a political career.
Though Mr. Romney left Bain in early 1999, he received a share of the corporate buyout and investment profits enjoyed by partners from all Bain deals through February 2009: four global buyout funds and 18 other funds, more than twice as many over all as Mr. Romney had a share of the year he left. He was also given the right to invest his own money alongside his former partners. Because some of the funds and deals covered by Mr. Romney's agreement will not fully wind down for several years, Mr. Romney is still entitled to a share of some of Bain's profits.
During his political career, Mr. Romney has promoted his experience as a businessman while deflecting criticism of layoffs caused by private equity deals by noting that he left Bain in 1999. But records and interviews show that in the years since, he has benefited from at least a few Bain deals that resulted in upheaval for companies, workers and communities.
One lucrative deal for Bain involved KB Toys, a company based in Pittsfield, Mass., which one of the firm's partnerships bought in 2000. Three years later, when Mr. Romney was the governor of Massachusetts, the company began closing stores and laying off thousands of employees. More recently, Bain helped lead the private equity purchase of Clear Channel Communications, the nation's largest radio station operator, which resulted in the loss of 2,500 jobs.
Much information about Mr. Romney's wealth is not known publicly. Federal law does not obligate him to disclose the precise details of his investments. He has declined to release his tax returns, and his campaign last week refused to say what tax rate he paid on his Bain earnings.
But since Mr. Romney's payouts from Bain have come partly from the firm's share of profits on its customers' investments, that income probably qualifies for the 15 percent tax rate reserved for capital gains, rather than the 35 percent that wealthy taxpayers pay on ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Service allows investment managers to pay the lower rate on the share of profits, known in the industry as ''carried interest,'' that they receive for running funds for investors.
''These are options that are not available to the ordinary taxpayer,'' said Victor Fleischer, a law professor at the University of Colorado who studies financial firms. ''You continue to take your carried interest -- a return on labor, not capital invested -- and you're paying 15 percent on it instead of high marginal income rates.''
Mr. Romney is among the wealthiest candidates ever to run for president, with a family fortune that his campaign has estimated at $190 million to $250 million. In the years since he left Bain, much of his wealth has migrated into investments outside the company or into family trusts, including an additional $100 million set aside for his five sons.
But the family's Bain holdings are still considerable: in his 2011 disclosure, Mr. Romney reported Bain assets between $12.4 million and $60.9 million, which provided between $1.5 million and $9.3 million in income. The blind trust for his wife, Ann, held at least another $10 million, generating income of at least $4.1 million. Because the campaign is required to provide only a minimum value for some Bain assets now held by Mrs. Romney, the total could be far more.
A spokesman for Bain declined to comment on the specifics of the arrangement, citing confidentiality agreements with Mr. Romney.
Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, said, ''This was a typical market deal. Bain Capital has no incentive to overpay Governor Romney, and they didn't.''
While other private equity firms have granted departing founders and senior executives a share of carried interest, also known as ''carry,'' Mr. Romney's retirement deal appears unusual for its length and the number of future funds it covered.
''Ten years ago, I would have said receiving carry on two successor funds would be considered fairly normal,'' said Cedric Teissier, a partner and general counsel at Triago, which raises money for private equity firms. Mr. Teissier said an arrangement like Mr. Romney's ''would probably be on the extravagant side.''
Other executives contended that the deal did not make Mr. Romney nearly as wealthy as his peers in private equity who took their firms public.
Profitable Percentages
While Mr. Romney is often described as a founder of Bain Capital, it originally grew out of another business: the management consulting firm Bain & Company, which spun off the private equity arm in 1984.
It was early in the leveraged buyout era, when sharp-elbowed Wall Street dealmakers like Henry R. Kravis, Stephen A. Schwarzman and Peter G. Peterson were starting private equity firms that raised money from investors -- university endowments and state pension funds -- and combined it with enormous amounts of debt to buy companies.
Bain & Company's patriarch, Bill Bain, persuaded Mr. Romney, one of his rising stars, and several other young Bain consultants to run Bain's new private equity operation. The majority of the $37 million raised for Bain Capital's first fund came from Bain & Company.
Small early deals, like a $2 million investment in an office supply store that would become Staples, proved successful. Bain's funds -- and deals -- grew quickly, with acquisitions like Domino's Pizza and the Sealy mattress company.
About every three years, the firm raised a new buyout fund, each doing business for about a decade: buying companies, restructuring and streamlining them, and then selling them, usually for a profit. In the early 1990s, the firm formed a new management entity, Bain Capital Inc. Mr. Romney was given full ownership, although it is not clear how much of his own money he invested.
Private equity firms typically act as the general partner for each fund they create. The firms collect an annual management fee equal to 2 percent of the fund during the period it is buying and restructuring companies. When companies are resold, the firm's partners also split a percentage of the profits. Bain's returns were so good, averaging 88 percent annually through the late 1990s, that it began taking 30 percent of the profits instead of the traditional 20 percent.
Former Bain officials say that when Mr. Romney ran the firm, he motivated colleagues by spreading profits widely and keeping a smaller percentage, often in the single digits, for himself. He and his co-workers also invested their own money in most of the deals to increase their personal returns.
Eventually, Mr. Romney turned his sights beyond the business world. In February 1999, he left Bain to help turn around the troubled organization of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. In 2001, Mr. Romney announced that he had formally transferred his ownership of Bain Capital Inc. to other partners.
But behind the scenes, Mr. Romney had negotiated his retirement agreement. Although he would no longer be a partner, he would continue to be paid a part of the firm's profits in buyout deals and other businesses, much as active partners were. The agreement would cover any new fund or venture started by his former partners until February 2009, although his stake would decline with each successive fund.
He and his wife also would be permitted to invest their own money in co-investment vehicles typically reserved for Bain executives.
While some former business associates said they considered the deal generous, others said Mr. Romney might have gotten even more from Bain had he not wanted a quick move into public life.
''He made a very sweet deal, he had a very good exit,'' said one former Bain partner, who requested anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. ''But my guess is, given the actual economic value of Bain Capital at the time, Mitt walked away with less than he could have if he did not take into account the adverse publicity and attention that a battle with former partners would have caused if he had negotiated and played hardball.''
Some specifics of Mr. Romney's holdings were revealed when, fresh off his successful stint running the Games, he entered the 2002 campaign for Massachusetts governor.
A disclosure form filed with the Massachusetts Ethics Commission, detailing the Romneys' finances for the previous year, reported stakes ranging from 2.1 percent to 16.5 percent of the firm's share of the profits in several Bain funds created before Mr. Romney left.
After taking office in 2003, Mr. Romney moved the bulk of his assets into two blind trusts, according to his Massachusetts financial disclosures. Today, many of the family's Bain assets appear to be held in Mrs. Romney's blind trust.
The 1999 retirement deal turned out to have a huge upside that few could have predicted: the golden age of private equity was just around the corner.
A Share of Huge Growth
Like the giants of the business, KKR and Blackstone, Bain's business ballooned in the years after Mr. Romney left. Private equity firms, armed with megafunds and cheap and easy Wall Street financing, set their sights on acquiring big brand-name companies. Bain formed a venture capital arm, spun off affiliates to pursue private equity investments in Europe and Asia and expanded Sankaty Advisors, an affiliate that makes investments in debt securities.
Mr. Romney's campaign declined to specify his share in the Bain funds started after he left. But even as his share of profits declined over time, the size of those funds was growing enormously.
In 1999, Bain had about $4 billion in assets under management, 100 or so employees and a single office, in Boston. In 2005, Bain had over $21 billion in its funds. Today, Bain manages about $66 billion over all, with 900 employees and 10 offices in 6 countries.
By giving Mr. Romney a stake in funds after his departure, Bain's partners effectively compensated him for his founding interest in the firm without having to write him a large check or taking Bain public, which would have allowed Mr. Romney to continue holding equity in the firm or cash out by selling his shares on the public market.
''One of the benefits of going public is that the founding generation of leaders can monetize their ownership stakes in their firms,'' said Scott M. Sperling, a co-president of the private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners. ''Bain has decided to remain a private partnership and chosen a different way to compensate its founder, which is not unusual.''
While Bain's deals typically yielded enormous profits for its investors and partners, several have led to serious financial problems -- and sizable layoffs -- at companies it acquired.
The 2000 purchase of KB Toys, then one of the country's largest toy retailers, became one of the most contentious.
As in most Bain deals, the partnership put up a small fraction of the money -- in this case $18 million -- and borrowed the rest of the $302 million purchase price. Just 16 months later, the toy company borrowed more to pay Bain and its investors an $85 million dividend.
That gave Mr. Romney and the other partners a quick 370 percent return on their money. But it also left the toy company with a heavy debt burden. Before long, the company began closing stores around the country and laid off 3,400 workers. It filed for bankruptcy protection in 2004.
Two more recent deals have also led to spiraling debt loads and layoffs. Since Bain and another private equity firm led a buyout in 2008 of Clear Channel Communications, the company has struggled under nearly $20 billion in debt and has cut 2,500 jobs.
Sensata Technologies, a European company that makes sensors and controls used by the auto and aerospace industries, prospered after a Bain-led buyout in 2006, but the firm also laid off several hundred American workers. Most of the jobs were moved overseas, and the federal Labor Department spent at least $780,000 to retrain some people who lost their jobs.
While difficult competitive and economic conditions have contributed to those companies' problems, Democrats have already made layoffs at Bain companies during Mr. Romney's tenure at the firm a centerpiece of their attacks on him. Americans United for Change, an independent group backed by organized labor, has begun an ad campaign comparing Mr. Romney to Gordon Gekko, the marauding buyout king portrayed in the movie ''Wall Street.''
''Bain Capital is proud of the work our employees and management teams do to build growing businesses and deliver superior returns for our investors,'' said Alex Stanton, a Bain spokesman. ''Mitt Romney has had no involvement with the management of the firm or any of our investments since February 1999. We understand some may question our record for political purposes, but our focus remains on building great companies and improving their operations.''
Mr. Romney has expressed regret for lost jobs while defending the work of private equity firms in creating efficient and successful companies.
''In each case, we tried to grow an enterprise and, in doing so, hopefully provide a better future for those associated with that enterprise,'' Mr. Romney said in an interview Sunday on Fox News Channel.
Tax Benefits
Tax treatment of hedge fund and private equity compensation has been another point of political contention. The debate in Washington boils down to whether the ''sweat equity'' provided by investment managers in putting deals together should entitle them to the special 15 percent tax rate on long-term capital gains, as opposed to the rates of up to 35 percent that normally apply to people providing services.
The lower rate had traditionally been reserved for investors who put their own capital at risk, but I.R.S. rulings in the early 1990s extended it to the share of profits paid to private equity and hedge fund managers. Democrats in Congress have periodically sought to rescind that privilege, and the Obama administration is considering another push to change that provision.
Mr. Romney's retirement deal, like that of other private equity managers who keep a portion of their firms' profits when they retire, could give him the lower rate on profits from deals he had nothing to do with.
''The rationale for having a capital gains preference is to encourage investors to put their cash into investments,'' said Mr. Fleischer, the University of Colorado law professor. ''Romney here isn't even putting in any labor.''
Much remains unknown about the Romneys' remaining holdings in Bain. Federal law does not require candidates to report underlying assets held by hedge funds or private equity firms in which they are invested, since the firms typically do not provide that information to their investors. Moreover, many of the family's Bain assets reside in Mrs. Romney's blind trust, which has looser disclosure requirements.
Much of that uncertainty would evaporate if Mr. Romney was elected: federal officeholders are not permitted to hold such private equity and hedge fund investments. If elected, Mr. Romney would most likely have to unwind his stakes in all Bain funds.

HEADLINE: Last Convoy of American Troops Leaves Iraq, Marking a War's End

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO and MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT; Duraid Adnan contributed reporting from Baghdad, and an employee of The New York Times from Mosul.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- The last convoy of American troops drove into Kuwait on Sunday morning, punctuating the end of the nearly nine-year war in Iraq.
As an indication of the country the United States is leaving behind, for security reasons the last soldiers made no time for goodbyes to Iraqis with whom they had become acquainted. To keep details of the final trip secret from insurgents -- or Iraqi security officers aligned with militias -- interpreters for the last unit to leave the base called local tribal sheiks and government leaders on Saturday morning and conveyed that business would go on as usual, not letting on that all the Americans would soon be gone.
The crossing brought a close to a final troop withdrawal drawn out over weeks of ceremonies in Baghdad and around Iraq, including a formal if muted flag-folding ceremony on Thursday, as well as visits by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, and a trip to Washington by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki.
The last troop movement out of Iraq, which included about 110 vehicles and 500 soldiers, began in darkness. Around 2:30 a.m., the convoy snaked out of Contingency Operating Base Adder, near the southern city of Nasiriya, and headed toward the border. 
As dawn approached on Sunday, the last trucks began to cross the border into Kuwait at an outpost lighted by floodlights and secured by barbed wire.
''I just can't wait to call my wife and kids and let them know I am safe,'' said Sgt. First Class Rodolfo Ruiz just before his armored vehicle crossed over the border. ''I am really feeling it now.''
Shortly after enterng Kuwait, Sergeant Ruiz told the men in his vehicle: ''Hey, guys, you made it.''
Then, he ordered the vehicles in his convoy not to flash their lights or honk their horns.
Many troops wondered how the Iraqis, whom they had worked closely with and trained over the past year, would react when they awakened on Sunday to find that the remaining American troops on the base had left without saying anything.
''The Iraqis are going to wake up in the morning, and nobody will be there,'' said a soldier who identified himself only as Specialist Joseph. He said he had emigrated to the United States from Iraq in 2009 and enlisted a year later, and refused to give his full name because he worried for his family's safety.
The reaction among Iraqis was muted, as it had been for weeks as the Americans packed up. Live images of the last convoy arriving in Kuwait were not shown on local television, as they were around the world. Some Iraqis were unaware on Sunday that the last of the American soldiers -- aside from a vestigial force at the embassy -- had left.
''I just heard from you that they've withdrawn,'' Mustafa Younis, an auto mechanic in Mosul, said to a reporter. ''We've been waiting for this day since 2003. When they invaded us, we carried our machine guns and went out to fight them. We decided to do suicide operations against them. They committed many crimes, and we lost a lot of things because of them.''
Some celebrated even before the final departure. On Saturday evening, Ahmed Haider, a teacher in the Khadimiya district of Baghdad, took his family out to a restaurant for a meal of pizza and sandwiches to mark the occasion.
''I feel so happy,'' he said. ''This is the real happiness for all Iraqis, and I do not know why people are not making a big deal of it.''
Of course, many Iraqis fear what comes next, and the withdrawal came against the backdrop of political crisis in Baghdad. A large group of mostly Sunni lawmakers announced a boycott of Parliament on Saturday in protest of a wave of arrests by the Shiite-dominated government that swept up a number of their aides and security guards.
Several guards who work for Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, a top Sunni leader, have been arrested, and the government is said to be preparing a case against Mr. Hashimi on terrorism charges.
Fearing that insurgents would try to attack the last Americans leaving the country, the military treated all convoys like combat missions.
As the armored vehicles drove through the desert, Marine, Navy and Army helicopters and planes flew overhead, scanning the ground for insurgents and preparing to respond if the convoys were attacked.
Col. Douglas Crissman, one of the military's top commanders in southern Iraq, said Friday in an interview that he planned to be in a Black Hawk helicopter over the convoy with special communication equipment.
''It is a little bit weird,'' he said, referring to how he had not told his counterparts in the Iraqi military when the Americans were leaving. ''But the professionals among them understand.''
Over the past year, Colonel Crissman and his troops spearheaded the military's efforts to ensure the security of Tampa, the long highway that passes through southern Iraq, which a majority of convoys passed through on the way out of the country.
''Ninety-five percent of what we have done has been for everyone else,'' Colonel Crissman said.
Across the highway, the military built relationships with 20 tribal sheiks, paying them to clear the highway of garbage, making it difficult for insurgents to hide roadside bombs in blown-out tires and trash.
Along with keeping the highway clean, the military hoped that the sheiks would help police the highway and provide intelligence on militants.
''I can't possibly be all places at one time,'' Colonel Crissman said in an interview in May. ''There are real incentives for them to keep the highway safe. Those sheiks we have the best relationships with and have kept their highways clear and safe will be the most likely ones to get renewed for the remainder of the year.''
All American troops were legally obligated to leave by the end of the month, but President Obama, in announcing in October the end of military operations here, promised that everyone would be home for the holidays.
Still, the United States will continue to play a role in Iraq. The largest American Embassy in the world is located here, and in the wake of the military departure it is doubling in size -- to roughly 16,000 people, most of them contractors. Under the authority of the ambassador will be fewer than 200 military personnel, to guard the embassy and oversee the sale of weapons to the Iraqi government.
History's final judgment on the war, which claimed nearly 4,500 American lives and cost almost $1 trillion, may not be determined for decades.
But as the last troop convoy crossed over, it marked neither victory, nor defeat, but a kind of stalemate -- one in which the optimists say violence has been reduced to a level that will allow the country to continue on its lurching path toward stability and democracy, and in which the pessimists say the American presence has been a Band-Aid on a festering wound.
''Things will go worse in Iraq after the U.S. withdrawal, on all levels -- security, economics and services,'' said Hatem Imam, a businessman in Basra. ''We are not ready for this.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Rejects Plan to Extend Payroll Tax Cut

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Helene Cooper contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House Republican leader on Sunday flatly rejected a short-term, bipartisan Senate measure to extend a payroll tax break and unemployment insurance, setting the stage for a bitter year-end Congressional collision and the potential loss of benefits for millions of Americans.
In an interview on ''Meet The Press'' on NBC, Speaker John A. Boehner said his members broadly opposed the two-month extension that passed the Senate 89 to 10, believing that it would be ''just kicking the can down the road.''
''It's time to just stop, do our work, resolve the differences and extend this for one year,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''How can you have tax policy for two months?'' 
The surprising setback threatened the holiday plans of lawmakers and President Obama, deeply embarrassed Republican leaders in both chambers and raised the specter of a year-end tax increase that economists have warned could set back the already fragile economic recovery.
The House is scheduled to take up the Senate bill -- passed in a rare Saturday session -- when members return to Capitol Hill on Monday night. House leaders expect the bill to fail and their members to then consider and perhaps vote on an amended version that same night.
Representative Tom Reed, a freshman Republican from upstate New York, said Monday: ''I am adamantly opposed to a short-term two-month extension bill. Enough is enough. If that's what the Senate believes is leadership, then I believe the Senate is a complete failure.
''Two months of policy for doctors, American workers and people suffering on unemployment is just plain ridiculous,'' Mr. Reed said. ''We should do at least a year's extension, if not further.''
Contrary to suggestions by some Democrats, Mr. Reed said, ''There was no representation from the speaker that he would be able to get support for a two-month deal'' in the House.
''We want to do long-term policy, not short-term politics,'' Mr. Reed said. ''The American people deserve more than short-term Band-Aids.''
Democrats, led by Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, reacted angrily to the turn of events in the House.
''When we met last week, Speaker Boehner requested that Senator McConnell and I work out a compromise,'' Mr. Reid said, referring to the minority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. ''Neither side got everything they wanted, but we forged a middle ground that passed the Senate by an overwhelming bipartisan majority.''
Although Mr. McConnell, like scores of his colleagues, voted for the Senate-brokered bill, he retreated from the measure on Sunday, throwing his support behind Mr. Boehner's idea to come up with a yearlong extension, which was the original goal of Mr. Obama and Senate Democrats.
''The House and the president both want a full-year extension,'' Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, said in an e-mail to reporters. ''The best way to resolve the difference between the two-month extension and the full-year bill, and provide certainty for job creators, employees and the long-term unemployed, is through regular order, as the speaker suggested.''
The once-seemingly sure deal, which allowed the Senate to recess for the year, was for a $33 billion package of bills to keep the Social Security tax paid by most workers at 4.2 percent rather than 6.2 percent, extend unemployment benefits for those already receiving them, and avoid reductions in Medicare payments to doctors. The measure would be effective through February.
But the deal slid off the rails abruptly on Saturday, just hours after the Senate vote, when House Republicans balked after being briefed about the terms by their leaders. Even a sweetener provision to speed the decision process for construction of an oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast could not mollify them. Mr. Boehner had called the provision a ''victory.''
So in a matter of hours, a hastily written agreement between Senate leaders -- one Mr. McConnell said Saturday on the Senate floor was ''not designed to fail but designed to pass'' -- gave way to chaos..
Just how hard Mr. Boehner tried to sell the bill is a matter of debate. Some Republican aides said that Mr. Boehner had warned Mr. McConnell his conference would be wary of the Senate deal, and that Mr. Boehner had presented it to his members in the conference call as one of several options. But a number of House members who participated in the call said Mr. Boehner told them they should accept the deal, however imperfect, and fight for a better one next year.
Republican leaders are seeking a deal for a full-year extension of the payroll tax cut to try to blunt what are certain to be Democratic accusations heading into an election year that Republicans are against tax cuts for low- and middle-income workers.
The conflict over the Senate bill reflects the fundamental unease that many rank-and-file Republicans have expressed for weeks over extending the tax holiday, which would replace the tax increase that would have gone toward the Social Security fund with general fund money.
It also mirrors a well-established pattern of House conservatives undermining Mr. Boehner's efforts to reach bipartisan compromises on a variety of fiscal matters. In July, Mr. Boehner and Mr. Obama were close to reaching a large deficit-reduction agreement but retreated when it became clear that the most conservative House Republicans would not agree to new revenue measures like increasing the income tax paid by the wealthy.
''We are witnessing a pattern of Speaker Boehner walking away from bipartisan compromises to kowtow to his extreme Tea Party wing of his caucus,'' Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said in a statement. ''This is the latest example of the Tea Party Republicans sacrificing the good of the country on the altar of extreme ideology.''
While some Republicans said Sunday that it was clear last week that House members might dislike the Senate bill, there was little indication of that on Saturday. Senators finished up the last bits of their business, including the vote on the payroll tax extension and a large spending bill, said their goodbyes and left for the holidays.
Senate Democrats indicated on Sunday that they had no intention of returning to Washington before the opening of the next session in January.
''There are only two choices for the House Republicans at this point,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate. ''Pass this bipartisan compromise or else they alone will be responsible for letting taxes rise on the middle class.''
There is a slight possibility that some Republicans would join with Democrats to pass it, which would be a disaster for Mr. Boehner's leadership. Mr. Boehner could also amend the bill to include a one-year extension of the payroll tax reduction and some conservative policy riders to make it acceptable to a majority of his conference, and hope that the Senate would return to negotiate a new bipartisan conference measure based on the two chambers' bills.

HEADLINE: Feminism's Uneven Success

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: For all the progress women have made on many fronts in the United States, paid family leave, child care and other social benefits lag behind those of many other countries, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
In the United States, as elsewhere, feminism could be characterized as the most successful social movement of the 20th century. Yet, perhaps because of its uneven impact, it seems to be losing momentum. 
Cultural and political mobilization around women's rights led to important legal gains, including the right to vote, prohibitions on overt discrimination and access to contraception. Women increased their participation in paid employment and political office, and many climbed into professional and managerial jobs. 
Over the last 20 years, however, the pace of change in attitudes, labor force participation and relative earnings has slowed, leading to speculation about the "end of the gender revolution." 
In my view, this revolution has not ended. But it has, like most revolutions, fallen far short of its ideals. In 2010, women's earnings, adjusted for factors that could affect pay - like age, race, education, number of children in the household and part-time status - amounted to about 86 percent of men's.

Perhaps movement toward equality is necessarily slow. Some people seem to worry that men won't want to marry women who are not their subordinates. And many women seem to prefer predominantly female occupations, even though they pay less. 
Gender inequality in earnings strongly reflects the penalty imposed on caregivers who take time out of paid employment. Median full-time salaries of young, unmarried, childless women under 30 living in cities are higher than those of their male counterparts. 
Demographic differences among women now have a large class dimension. A substantial share of women with a college degree - 23 percent of those ages 40 to 44 in 2008 - remain childless. Yet the college educated are now more likely than others to marry, a factor that contributes to their higher family income. Married fathers are more likely than others to live with their children and contribute directly to their care. 
Class and racial and ethnic differences among women have intensified over time. The higher earnings of college-educated mothers make it possible for them to purchase child care and help with housework (typically performed by low-wage women workers). A recent paper by the economists Delia Furtado and Heinrich Hock shows that the number of low-skill immigrants living in a large city reduces the tradeoff between employment and fertility for women college graduates. 
Outsourcing of care responsibilities can have many positive effects, but it reduces the potential for cross-class gender coalitions. Emphasis on changes in women's average or median earnings relative to men often conceals growing inequality among women. 
As Leslie McCall, a Northwestern University sociologist, describes recent trends, "Absolute gains among women as a whole, and visible absolute gains among more highly educated women in particular, came at the expense of the worsening situation of low-skilled women, whose real wages have been falling." 
A college education often provides access to relatively flexible jobs. As Jennifer Cheeseman Day of the Census Bureau explains in this webinar recently orchestrated by the Population Association of America, women in professional-managerial occupations are more likely than other working women to reduce their hours of employment when they have a preschool child, a factor that can help them achieve better work/family balance. 
Women in less remunerative occupations are often forced to choose between making do with long hours or finding part-time jobs that pay even more poorly and don't offer benefits. 
In the same webinar, I discussed the chart above, showing that employed college-educated women are now more likely than they once were to enjoy some paid leave from employment upon the birth of their first child - 66 percent in 2006-8 compared with 27 percent in 1971-5. Employed mothers without a high school degree, by contrast, have remained stuck at 18 percent. 
As the webinar also points out, paid family leave is a universal entitlement in virtually all other affluent countries, where child care and early childhood education are also subsidized more generously. 
Demographic and economic differences among both women and men in the United States make it difficult to mobilize support for such policies here. And in the absence of such policies, inequality is likely to intensify. 
The gender revolution didn't cause this problem, but it is surely being hindered by it.

What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: End-of-the-Year Lists
Here's a list of 10 things that have shaped our lives over the last 10 years. Joshua M. Brown offers the 10 biggest moments for the markets, a slide show displays the most innovative products, and Anthony Weiner leads the 10 worst media disasters of the year. Andrew O'Hehir lists his 10 top movies, Gizmodo lists the most expensive computer bugs, and let's not forget the top 10 pranks of 2011. More? O.K. Google issues its 10 most searched terms. And here are the most overused buzzwords on LinkedIn this year. Wendy's wins top tweet of 2011. Lifehacker shares its most popular Windows downloads and posts, and of course there are the 50 most viral videos of the year. Can you guess the 20 most played Christmas songs on the radio?
The Economy: Pop the Corks?
Small-business confidence grows for the third month in a row. Economic data is outperforming expectations, so the Fed says the economy is healthier and plans no new steps. Here's a graphic summary of the Federal Reserve chairman's decade in Washington. President Obama says unemployment could be 8 percent by the election. Bill McBride says 8 percent is possible, "but it seems unlikely unless growth picks up." Manufacturing (pdf) has another great quarter. And even though Champagne sales are at a record high, a money manager says the markets are readying for a recession. Ezra Klein says we're not even close to solving our economic problems. And Derek Thompson proves that economists are usually wrong - except for David Rosenberg, named Fortune's best economist of Wall Street. Barry Eichengreen says 2012 will be a year of muddling through. A plastic bag sabotages the news.
The Data: More Jobs 
The New York and Philadelphia Feds report improvement. Retail sales rise less than expected -- although some people are still impressed. Not Nathan Martin, however: "The reportis grossly overstated due to measurement in dollars and also due to substitution bias which fails to account for stores that have closed." Monthly payments for new homes have never been lower. The number of job openings in October was essentially unchanged from September. But weekly unemployment claims fall to a three-year low. Even as bank credit hits its highest level since before the crisis, Janean Chun wonders why more small businesses aren't getting loans from big banks.
Your People: A Turnover Calculator
Try this calculator to see how much employee turnover hurts your business. A new report finds one in five workers suffer from a mental illness that affects productivity. Top earners were hit hard in the recession. In a TED talk, Sheryl Sandberg explains why we have too few women leaders. A majority of Americans say they would rat out a boss. Here's a list of jobs where people work the most for the least. A third of business owners work more than 40 hours a week. The Bureau of Economic Analysis releases a new compensation by county report. The Startup Boy explains why you can't hire: "There isn't a shortage of developers and designers. There's a surplus of founders." Gar Alperovitz says that more companies are becoming worker-owned. Facebook, Google, Apple and Rackspace are voted the best places to work in 2012. Jimmy Kimmel wonders which kids got the worst Christmas presents.
Around the Country: A Brick-and-Mortar App Store?
San Francisco plans to "put more money into consumer" pockets by raising the minimum wage above $10. Congrats to the top 10 women-led businesses in Boston. Los Angeles wants to be a beachhead for tech start-ups. Six small businesses in Texas talk about how they're coping with the economy. A Boulder, Colo., business owner opens an honest-to-goodness app store. Entrepreneurs plan a "hybrid accelerator" in Baltimore. San Francisco regulates dog walkers, and here's why I'm kicking my dog out of my bed.A woman leaves $13 million to her pet cat.
Around the World: Migrating Back to India
China, a bright spot in trade, plans to impose duties on American cars. Here's how to prove something you want to believe, for example: is Facebook driving the Greek debt crisis? Mark Marich reports that it's getting easier to do business around the world: "Over the past six years, 94 percent of the economies covered have made their regulatory environment more business-friendly." A bunch of Kazakhstani 9-year-olds fight each other after a hockey game. A Wharton blogger explains why more people are migrating back to India. A boy enjoys Italy, Brazil ... and ice cream.
Start-Up: A Solution to the Mail Crisis
The United States Postal Service delays its planned closing of branches for another five months, but an Austin start-up may have the solution. H&M stores introduce a Dragon Tattoo line. Here's start-up secret No. 5: know when to walk away. A financing firm joins the Startup America partnership. Jason Finger offers two million reasons to start (or invest in) a small business today. Jive Software's initial public offering signals that investors are hungry for social networking stocks. But the forecast remains gloomy for start-up financing.
Red Tape Update: Comparing Tax Proposals
A senator introduces bipartisan legislation to encourage entrepreneurs and innovators to start companies. The Tax Foundation offers a great side-by-side comparison of the Republican presidential candidates' tax proposals. Paul Kedrosky posts three tax graphs that are NOT boring. Here are 10 last-minute tax breaks for 2011. Karen Klein discusses resources for veterans who want to run a small business. The White House cuts production of presidential coins, and James E. Miller wonders if nickels and pennies will disappear. Some small businesses are working harder for federal contracting opportunities. A thief gets caught after pocket-dialing 911.
Ideas: And the Most Expensive Airport Is ...
Paychex introduces a Web site to help entrepreneurs start, grow and manage a business. Ivana Taylor lists her favorite start-up books. A new social media platform connects farmers and buyers. Scientists get closer to solving a puzzle about the universe, but here's a bigger discovery -- hairy limbs may keep bedbugs at bay. BizFilings announces its Small Business Roundtable. Can you guess the most expensive American airport to fly from? Mike Pugh lists three ways to stay accessible to customers during the holidays. And Network Solutions proposes 12 ways to make over your business in 2012.
Marketing: Southwest Gives Chills
Constant Contact creates a new category for small-business marketing. Jeremy Epstein explains how Southwest Airlines gave him the chills (the good kind). Here's a graphic showing the top 20 marketing automation software solutions. Your dentist may be breaking the law by offering deals on Groupon and LivingSocial. Stacey Acevero explains how color can affect your online press releases. People are spending more time getting their news from mobile devices than from print media. Anthony Saladino explains how to build credibility and consumer confidence: "Collect testimonials. Consumers often feel more comfortable purchasing from a company if they see positive reviews from other satisfied customers." John Jantsch suggests five trends that will shape small businesses in 2012.
The Week's Bests
Way to Fix the Economy. Matt Yglesias explains how eliminating paper money could end recessions: "People prefer to keep money in bank accounts because it's convenient and because you get interest on it. If the rates were driven below zero - in effect a tax on holding cash in the bank - people would just withdraw money and store it in shoe boxes instead. What if all transactions were electronic, so the only way to avoid keeping money in a negative-rate account was to go out and buy something with the money? Well, then, we would have solved our depression problem."
Way to Get More Customers With Fewer Leads. Mike Volpe gives a few tips: "Create middle-of-the-funnel content. Middle-of-the-funnel content is specific and ties in information about your industry to your product. An example of this may be an e-book that discusses how you use your product to overcome an industry-related challenge or even an offer such as a demo that brings your lead closer to a sale. You need to start by generating white bread leads with top-of-the-funnel offers and then use your middle-of-the-funnel offers to turn them into hearty loaves of wheat bread!"
Way to Accomplish More by Doing Less. Tony Schwartz suggests: "Consider the study that the performance expert Anders Ericcson did of violinists at the Berlin Academy of Music. The best of the violinists practiced in sessions no longer than 90 minutes, and took a break in between each one. They almost never practiced more than four and a half hours over a day. What they instinctively understood was the law of diminishing returns. The top violinists also got an average of more than eight hours of sleep a night, and took a 20- to 30-minute nap every afternoon. Over a week, they slept 16 hours more than the average American does."

HEADLINE: The Plight of China's Favored Sons

BYLINE: ALEXANDRA HARNEY


HIGHLIGHT: For China's government, social stability is threatened by a gender imbalance likely to leave up to 40 million Chinese without a wife. 

 BODY:
ZHUHAI, China - In the rural Chinese town where Li Yiming grew up, the gossip mill starts to turn if a man is still single at 25. As he nears this milestone, the 23-year-old Li, an assembly-line worker in the coastal city of Zhuhai, is despondent. He knows he'll never earn enough at any factory to win the approval of his girlfriend's parents.
Finding a spouse isn't easy anywhere. But Li (whose name has been changed) is part of a cohort of millions of Chinese men, the favored sons, whose chances of ever getting married are particularly slim. After a rapid decline in fertility rates and decades of sex-selective abortions, there are now many more potential grooms than brides in China. This "marriage squeeze," as demographers call the imbalance, is not a historical first - Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea have all had trouble marrying off their men - but in China it may be unprecedented in scale. 
According to Dudley Poston, a professor of sociology at Texas A&M University, and his colleagues, 40 million Chinese men alive today will likely be left without a wife. That's more people than the population of California. 
Uneducated men from the countryside like Li have the worst prospects because many marriages in rural China are local. Traditional family ties often mean that the first choice for a spouse is someone from the same town. But sex ratios at birth (S.R.B.) - the ratio of boys born to girls - are generally much higher in the countryside than in the cities. And so the market dynamics of marriage for men in rural areas are much worse than in the cities.
Demographers consider a natural S.R.B. to be between 104 and 107 boys born for every 100 girls. Nationally, China's sex ratio at birth is 120 boys per 100 girls; in rural areas, where couples often have more than one child, the S.R.B. for second children rises to 145 (and in nine provinces, it's a staggering 160, according to Poston). By comparison, the U.S. sex ratio at birth is 105 boys per 100 girls. The main reason for this gap is the use of ultrasound scanners to determine the gender of fetuses, followed by the abortion of many female ones. 
The other reason Li will have a hard time finding a wife is the "no money, no honey" dynamic. Chinese brides and their parents prefer men with the highest possible income, in particular those who own property. A recent study by the China Youth Daily found that 35 percent of women of marrying age would not consider tying the knot with a man who didn't own property or who couldn't afford to buy some. Li earns about $3,400 a year and his girlfriend's parents expect him to buy an apartment that costs about $47,000.
What will happen if so many Chinese men never get married?Wei Shang-jin, of Columbia University, and Zhang Xiaobo, of the International Food Policy Research Institute, predict that China's marriage squeeze could stimulate economic growth by prodding men to work harder in order to woo a bride. But most projections are not so sanguine.
Some observers predict that disgruntled bachelors like Li will go on strike to ask for more money or may resort to crime. Texas A&M's Poston argues that cases of H.I.V. could rise as men congregate in "bachelor ghettos" in big cities. Others still warn that China may be more likely to go to war to keep its single men out of trouble at home.
At a minimum, the marriage squeeze will widen various disparities in Chinese society today: between the rich and the poor, the cities and the countryside, those with property and those without. None of these is a good scenario for a Chinese government whose primary objective is stability.

HEADLINE: Behind the Cover Story: Jonathan Mahler on Benton Harbor

BYLINE: RACHEL NOLAN


HIGHLIGHT: An interview with Jonathan Mahler on states of emergency, race riots, downsizing cities, and what's next for Michigan. 

 BODY:
Q.
Benton Harbor is an extreme example of several trends - bankruptcy, racial segregation and, above all, income inequality. How many places like Benton Harbor are there in America?
A.
Benton Harbor really is an extreme example - to be the poorest town in a state as deeply troubled as Michigan is no mean feat - but as you say the underlying problems are hardly unique. The downward spiral - the absence of jobs creates a kind of permanent underclass; the permanent underclass creates a declining tax base; the declining tax base damages city services, local schools most of all, making positive change that much more difficult - is all too common in American cities now. What is different about Benton Harbor is that, for better or worse, it has a Fortune 500 company with a vested interest in its future.
Q.
One of the leaders of the Harbor Shores development, Marcus Robinson imagines a very attractive future for Benton Harbor as an affluent African-American town. But you write that the parts of Benton Harbor that are being renewed from one perspective and gentrified from another, from the golf club to the arts district, are white-dominated. In the '60s it seems Benton Harbor was less segregated. Did prosperity somehow track with increased racial mixing? You mention race riots - what happened?
A.
I'm not sure Benton Harbor was ever fully, comfortably integrated, though it certainly did have a much larger white population and, because of all of the factory jobs, less income disparity. Once the jobs started disappearing, the vast majority of the white people did, too. Harbor Shores, the resort development, will presumably bring white people back, but not working-class white people, who could never afford the homes there.
One thing I didn't really have the room to get into in the piece is that in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Benton Harbor became a kind of national symbol of the enduring racial divide in America. It was the setting for"The Other Side of the River," Alex Kotlowitz's excellent 1998 book about the death of a local black teenager last seen running down a street in St. Joseph, the predominantly white, middle-class town across the river. Then, in 2003, race riots erupted when a 27-year-old black man crashed his motorcycle into the side of an abandoned building in Benton Harbor while being chased by two white police officers. The national media flooded in. All of the attention that the town received actually contributed to the state's resolve to get involved - which helped get Harbor Shores off the ground.
Q.
At Benton Harbor's height, you write, 20,000 people lived there. Now 10,000 people live there. What is being done with the empty houses?
A.
A lot of the houses are abandoned. Some have already been razed, and a lot more will be razed soon, thanks to a big grant from HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development].
Q.
There is now a whole branch of urban planning devoted not to growing cities but to downsizing them. Parts of Detroit have become urban farms. When East German cities emptied out after reunification in 1990, municipal authorities literally turned the lights out in some areas. Does anyone imagine that Benton Harbor will regain enough population to avoid these types of measures?
A.
Yeah, in 1970s New York, serious thought was given to a plan known as "planned shrinkage" - basically abandoning some of the worst ghettos in the South Bronx and elsewhere. It's hard to imagine Benton Harbor not ultimately emptying out, whether it's a plan engineered by city and state administrators or just inevitable attrition, though where these people will go is anybody's guess. I think the concern among many there is that the city is basically going to drive them out with higher taxes, water rates, etc. And the more paranoid fear is that Whirlpool and Harbor Shores want them out so they can have their way with the land.
Q.
Roger Lange is an interesting figure in your article. Chief of the combined fire and police departments, he doesn't seem to have many resources at his disposal. Does he complain about the jury-rigged fire trucks you describe?
A.
Actually, no. Lange is a big supporter of what Joe Harris has been doing in Benton Harbor. He also claims that his police force is managing just fine after Harris's budget cuts, largely because he's been able to hire part-timers to replace the full-time, salaried employees he has lost.
Q.
Are the laws that allowed Harris to take over as an emergency manager in Benton Harbor on the books in states other than Michigan? If the only criterion for takeover were that city be "failing," I could think of a lot of candidates - in California, Florida, Nevada.
A.
I'm not an expert on this, but my understanding is that some states have provisions that allow cities to declare states of emergency - and in so doing, request help from the state - but that Michigan's Emergency Manager legislation is unique. The powers it gives an appointee of the state to circumvent elected officials really are breathtaking.

HEADLINE: It's Time to Rethink 'Temporary'

BYLINE: ALLISON ARIEFF


HIGHLIGHT: There are compelling reasons right now to move away from "static" architecture and embrace impermanence. 

 BODY:
We tend to view architecture as permanent, as aspiring to the status of monuments. And that kind of architecture has its place. But so does architecture of a different sort.
For most of the first decade of the 2000s, architecture was about the statement building. Whether it was a controversial memorial or an impossibly luxurious condo tower, architecture's raison d'etre was to make a lasting impression. Architecture has always been synonymous with permanence, but should it be?
In the last few years, the opposite may be true. Architectural billings are at an all-time low. Major commissions are few and far between. The architecture that's been making news is fast and fleeting: pop-up shops, food carts, marketplaces, performance spaces. And while many manifestations of the genre have jumped the shark (i.e., a Toys R Us pop-up shop), there is undeniable opportunity in the temporary: it is an apt response to a civilization in flux. And like many prevailing trends - collaborative consumption (a.k.a., "sharing"), community gardens, barter and trade - "temporary" is so retro that it's become radical.
In November, I had the pleasure of moderating Motopia, a panel at University of Southern California's School of Architecture, with Robert Kronenburg, an architect, professor at University of Liverpool and portable/temporary/mobile guru. Author of a shelf full of books on the topic, including "Flexible: Architecture that Responds to Change," "Portable Architecture: Design and Technology" and "Houses in Motion: The Genesis," Kronenburg is a man obsessed.
Mobility has an innate potency, Kronenburg believes. Movable environments are more dynamic than static ones, so why should architecture be so static? The idea that perhaps all buildings shouldn't aspire to permanence represents a huge shift for architecture. Without that burden, architects, designers, builders and developers can take advantage of and implement current technologies faster. Architecture could be reusable, recyclable and sustainable. Recast in this way, it could better solve seemingly unsolvable problems. And still succeed in creating a sense of place.
In his presentation, Kronenburg offered examples of how portable, temporary architecture has been used in every aspect of human activity, including health care (from Florence Nightingale'sredesigned hospitals to the Airstream trailers used as mobile medical clinics during the Kennedy Administration), housing (from yurts to tents to architect Shigeru Ban's post-earthquake paper houses), culture and commerce (stage sets and Great Exhibition buildings, centuries-old Bouqinistes along the Seine, mobile food, art and music venues offering everything from the recording of stories to tasty creme brulees.) 
Kronenburg made a compelling argument that the experimentation inherent in such structures challenges preconceived notions about what buildings can and should be. The strategy of temporality, he explained, "adapts to unpredictable demands, provides more for less, and encourages innovation." And he stressed that it's time for end-users, designers, architects, manufacturers and construction firms to rethink their attitude toward temporary, portable and mobile architecture.
This is as true for development and city planning as it is for architecture. City-making may have happened all at once at the desks of master planners like Daniel Burnham or Robert Moses, but that's really not the way things happen today. No single master plan can anticipate the evolving and varied needs of an increasingly diverse population or achieve the resiliency, responsiveness and flexibility that shorter-term, experimental endeavors can. Which is not to say long-term planning doesn't have its place. The two work well hand in hand. Mike Lydon, founding principal of The Street Plans Collaborative, argues for injecting spontaneity into urban development, and sees these temporary interventions (what he calls "tactical urbanism") as short-term actions to effect long-term change.
Though there's been tremendous media attention given to quick and cheap projects like San Francisco's Pavement to Parks and New York's "gutter cafes," Lydon sees something bigger than fodder for the style section. "A lot of these things were not just fun and cool," he says. "It was not just a bottom-up effort. It's not D.I.Y. urbanism. It's a continuum of ideas, techniques and tactics being employed at all different scales."
"We're seeing a lot of these things emerge for three reasons," Lydon continues. "One, the economy. People have to be more creative about getting things done. Two, the Internet. Even four or five years ago we couldn't share tactics and techniques via YouTube or Facebook. Something can happen randomly in Dallas and now we can hear about it right away. This is feeding into this idea of growth, of bi-coastal competition between New York and San Francisco, say, about who does the cooler, better things. And three, demographic shifts. Urban neighborhoods are gentrifying, changing. They're bringing in people looking to improve neighborhoods themselves. People are smart and engaged and working a 40-hour week. But they have enough spare time to get involved and this seems like a natural step."
Lydon isn't advocating an end to planning but encourages more short-term doing, experimenting, testing (which can be a far more satisfying alternative to waiting for projects to pass). While this may not directly change existing codes or zoning regulations, that's O.K. because, as Lydon explains, the practices employed "shine a direct light on old ways of thinking, old policies that are in place." 
The Dallas group Build a Better Block - which quickly leapt from a tiny grass-roots collective to an active partner in city endeavors - has demonstrated that when you expose weaknesses, change happens. If their temporary interventions violate existing codes, Build a Better Block just paints a sign informing passers-by of that fact. They have altered regulations in this fashion. Sometimes - not always - bureaucracy gets out of the way and allows for real change to happen.
Testing things out can also help developers chart the right course for their projects. Says Lydon, "A developer can really learn what's working in the neighborhood from a marketplace perspective - it could really inform or change their plans. Hopefully they can ingratiate themselves with the neighborhood and build community. There is real potential if the developers are really looking to do that."
And they are. Brooklyn's De Kalb Market, for example, was supposed to be in place for just three years, but became a neighborhood center where there hadn't been much of one before. "People gravitated towards it," says Lydon. "People like going there. You run the risk of people lamenting the loss of that. The developer would be smart to integrate things like the community garden - [giving residents an] opportunity to keep growing food on the site. The radio station could get a permanent space. The beer garden could be kept."
San Francisco's PROXY project is similar. Retail, restaurants and cultural spaces housed within an artful configuration of shipping containers, designed by Envelope Architecture and Design, were given a five-year temporary home on government-owned vacant lots in the city's Hayes Valley neighborhood while developers opted to sit tight during the recession. Affordable housing is promised for the site; the developers will now be able to create it in a neighborhood that has become increasingly vibrant and pedestrian-friendly.
On an even larger scale, the major developer Forest City has been testing these ideas of trial and error in the 5M Project in downtown San Francisco. While waiting out the downturn, the folks behind 5M have been beta-testing tenants and uses at their 5th & Mission location, which was (and still is) home to the San Francisco Chronicle and now also to organizations like TechShop, the co-working space HubSoma, the art gallery Intersection for the Arts, the tech company Square and a smattering of food carts to feed those hungry, hardworking tenants. A few years earlier, Forest City would have been more likely to throw up an office tower with some luxury condos on top and call it a day: according to a company vice president, Alexa Arena, the recession allowed Forest City to spend time "re-imagining places for our emerging economy and what kind of environment helps facilitate that."
In "The Interventionist's Toolkit," the critic Mimi Zeiger wrote that the real success for D.I.Y. urbanist interventions won't be based on any one project but will "happen when we can evaluate the movement based on outreach, economic impact, community empowerment, entrepreneurship, sustainability and design. We're not quite there yet."
She's right. And one doesn't have to search for examples of temporary projects that not only failed but did so catastrophically (see: Hurricane Katrina trailers, for example). A huge reason for tactical urbanism's appeal relates to politics. As one practitioner put it, "We're doing these things to combat the slowness of government." 
But all of this is more than a response to bureaucracy; at its best it's a bold expression of unfettered thinking and creativity and there's certainly not enough of that going around these days. An embrace of the temporary and tactical may not be perfect, but it could be one of the strongest tools in the arsenal of city-building we've got.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg TV Hires Former CNBC Anchor

BYLINE: BRIAN STELTER


HIGHLIGHT: Trish Regan, a former anchor on CNBC, will join Bloomberg Television as an anchor on "Street Smart.'' 

 BODY:
10:40 a.m. | Updated | For the third time this month, a former CNBC anchor has found a new job at a CNBC rival.
On Monday Bloomberg Television announced that Trish Regan, who was an anchor for CNBC until this year, is becoming an anchor of "Street Smart," its 3 to 5 p.m. newscast, which covers the closing of the United States markets. The two current anchors, Lisa Murphy and Adam Johnson, will stay on the newscast with her.
Ms. Regan will also anchor some prime time specials and some of Bloomberg's election year news coverage. "She'll play a key role on our Bloomberg team as we move forward with our goal of becoming the most influential business and financial news network," Andrew Morse, the head of Bloomberg Television in the United States, said in a statement.
Since exiting CNBC, Ms. Regan has been appearing on ABC's "Good Morning America" and "World News" as an economic expert. Before she joined CNBC, she was a correspondent for the "CBS Evening News."
At Bloomberg, Ms. Regan will have more screen time but a smaller American audience than she had at CNBC, which is the dominant business news network in the nation. Bloomberg is not publicly rated by Nielsen, but the private ratings show that it has a smaller share of the audience than Fox Business, CNBC's other rival in the business news category.
At any given time this year, about 197,000 people were watching CNBC and about 58,000 were watching Fox Business. But those numbers obscure the fact that business news networks attract a well-heeled, out-of-home audience that is not measured by Nielsen.
About two weeks ago Fox Business Melissa Francis, who had been an anchor of CNBC's "Power Lunch" program. Ms. Francis saw her role at CNBC reduced when the channel made changes to its lineup earlier this fall.
And last week, Bloomberg hired Guy Johnson, who had been an anchor for CNBC Europe. He will be a London-based anchor for the channel.
"Bloomberg Television's multiple media platforms represent a real advantage as my colleagues and I continue to report from the forefront of the eurozone crisis," Mr. Johnson said in a statement. "I eagerly look forward to the challenge of making sense of this story for the millions of viewers that tune in every day."

HEADLINE: Saab Bankruptcy: Long Before the Fall, Innovations Aplenty

BYLINE: PHIL PATTON


HIGHLIGHT: With the Swedish automaker's bankruptcy, a legacy of automotive quirk and iconoclasm appears to be ending. 

 BODY:
Barring an unforeseen rescue, Saab's long, strange trip through Swedish courts and Chinese office towers appears to be over.
As reported in The Times on Monday, the automaker's attempts to work out a deal with a Chinese company ran aground on the refusal of General Motors, its former owner, to allow critical technology licenses to be transferred. G.M. retained a veto over the deal through key stock ownership and it did not want some of the technologies to surface as potential competition to its joint venture in China with the S.A.I.C. Motor Corporation.
Apropos of the season, over a figurative warm mug of glogg, Wheels is recollecting th e company that popularized seat heaters, just one of many innovations that were personal and practical in a way that came to distinguish the company's approach to building cars.
Saab was established in the late 1940s as the offspring of a Swedish aviation company. Its name is an acronym for Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget, or Swedish Airplane Company, founded in 1937 to build aircraft for the Swedish Air Force, a job that Saab AB, the aeronautics and defense company, continues to do.
The first Saab bodies were strikingly literal renditions of the aerodynamic wisdom of the day. Beginning with the 92, the cars were the work of Sixten Sason, a Swedish industrial designer born in 1912 who also drafted Hasselblad cameras, Electrolux vaccuum cleaners and Husqvarna tools. Sason's last model, the 99 of 1969, introduced pioneering design features like a wrap-around windshield and hatchback.
With the 900 convertible, the company helped resuscitate the drop top after much of the car industry had given up on it. Saab helped popularize the use of disc brakes and famously positioned the ignition away from the steering column, at the level of the gearshift.
Saabs was also notorious for their electrical problems and the inevitable joke, "They named it Saab because that's what you do when you see the repair bill."
But more than any other, one Saab innovation has exerted outsize influence on the industry. That is the company's establishment of the small-displacement turbocharged engine as the way to resolve the conflicting desires for fuel economy and available torque. Ford's EcoBoost engines and G.M.'s 2-liter units are just the latest proof of the idea's salience.
Saab was always the offbeat choice. "Made by trolls in Trollhattan" read the bumper stickers of proud Saab owners, referencing the Swedish city in which most Saabs were produced.
The first Saab sold in the United States was brought over in 1956 by an import agent, Ralph Millet, whose challenge was to identify dealers eager to sell an odd-looking car with a two-stroke, 3-cylinder engine. But Saab outlasted French and Italian automakers like Peugeot and Fiat in the American market.
Saab has always had a tweedy, academic reputation. Kurt Vonnegut, the novelist and essayist, managed a Saab dealership on Cape Cod. In his book "A Man Without a Country," he quipped that the experience negatively impacted his writing career. "I believe my failure as a dealer so long ago explains what would otherwise remain a deep mystery: why the Swedes have never given me a Nobel Prize for literature," he wrote.
As a branch of General Motors, Saab put its own griffin-head badges on a Subaru Impreza (the 9-2X) and a reworked Chevrolet TrailBlazer (the 9-7X).
Saab's plans for the future were embodied in two famous concepts. The Aero X design study, inspired by Saab's "born from jets" marketing message, reflected the influence of aeronautics. Anthony Lo, the chief designer, said that the concept, which never entered production or otherwise greatly influenced design at the company, was inspired by the Gripen jet fighter, a joint venture of Saab and BAE Systems, sold around the world.
More recently, the PhoeniX concept and sketches for a future 9-3 by young star designer Jason Castriota raised hopes that the brand would make bold statements again. Mr. Castriota described the shape as having been inspired by the earliest Saabs, the so-called Ur Saab of Sason, distinguished by its teardrop shape and canopy. Protruding shapes at the C-pillars swept backward as flying buttresses, or winglets, in a ribbon effect -- a striking, romantic and perhaps last gesture, it turns out.

HEADLINE: Climate Panel Needs to Follow its Own Advice

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The chairman of an an international climate panel draws scrutiny for statements on policy choices. 

 BODY:
I believe it's time for Rajendra K. Pachauri to take a new approach to discussing climate change or leave the chairmanship of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change after nearly a decade in that position. There is an unavoidable and counterproductive blurriness to the line between his personal advocacy for climate action -- which is his right as an individual -- and his stature as the leader of the panel, which was established in 1988 as "a policy relevant but policy neutral organization."
The latest crystallization of this problem came last Thursday, when Pachauri participated in a meeting on "Extreme Climate Risks and California's Future," organized by California Gov. Jerry Brown.
Pachauri was part of a spirited discussion with Gov. Brown and Sir Richard Branson, the entrepreneur and adventurer who's taken on the climate issue through his Carbon War Room effort (the moderator was Felicity Barringer of The Times). The men chatted about everything from economic troubles and the housing bubble to opportunities for remaking California's energy mix to ways to deal with people obstructing such changes.
Mark Hertsgaard, who covers the environment for The Nation, filed a post Thursday on the Grist blog describing a jocular moment:
Pachauri joked that [Richard] Branson could give climate deniers tickets on the aviation mogul's planned flights into outer space. "Perhaps it could be a one-way ticket," Pachauri said, smiling, "though I'm not sure space deserves them."
That post was amended Sunday night after it became clear -- through a series of e-mail exchanges I initiated with both Pachauri and Hertsgaard -- that the concept of sending certain people into space originated with Branson. But in reviewing video of the proceedings posted on the conference Web site it's also clear that Pachauri enthusiastically amplified on the notion.
One could discount this as jocular banter, of course. And it pales beside some of the extremely vicious rhetoric that has developed elsewhere in the climate debate. But the full tape, outside the joking, actually makes things worse, to my mind. It vividly illustrates the blurring that I see undercutting the credibility of the climate panel just when it is needed most -- as the organization gets into high gear on its fifth assessment of climate change, which will roll out in 2013 and 2014.
Here's Pachauri's longer statement, the first part of which is spot on and illustrates how it's possible to convey meaning and import without advocacy: 
On the role of the I.P.C.C., what we are trying to do is to tell the world, through scientific work, which involves the best scientists, thousands of them mobilized and working together without any compensation from the I.P.C.C., purely as a labor of love, is the fact that if we don't do something the impacts are going to get progressively more negative.
But the tail end of the comment illustrates a pattern that Pachauri, in particular, has slid into year after year:
And the solutions are so much in the field of attractive options that we ought to get on with it. And we've heard so many co-benefits. Energy security. If you're sending hundreds of billions of dollars to other parts of the world you're depriving your own citizens of the opportunity to invest that money in doing other productive things. So I think we've got to bring about this transition. And those who are becoming obstacles in implementing what is rational should be made the responsibility of Sir Richard to give this one-way ticket to outer space. Of course space would be unfortunate to get some of these fellows.
Over the weekend, I was involved in extended e-mail exchanges with Pachauri, Hertsgaard, Branson's office and Barringer to try to clarify who said what (all before the video clarified things). This morning, once the situation was clear, Pachauri sent this note:
This whole thing was in jest, and you would notice that I did not name anybody or group. Indeed, if it were not for Sir Richard making that comment I would not have said anything like this to extend the joke further. To be honest the whole thing was in the form of light banter, and I do not even recall the second reference, to be honest. But in retrospect I should not have said it. I agree entirely.
In an interview in 2009, after another instance in which Pachauri advocated particular policies, he defended his approach this way:
"When I quote from the I.P.C.C. I make sure that whatever I say is totally accurate," he said. "But that doesn't prevent me from expressing my own views. I do get criticism, but if you stand still you won't get anywhere."
To my eye, Pachauri has strayed too often into policy statements that, to my mind, go well beyond what the panel, in its charter and its new communication plan, is supposed to do "to ensure objectivity and transparency as well as safe-guard the IPCC as a policy-relevant but policy-neutral organization."
Of course, my views are simply those of someone who has relied on the panel as a journalist since it was created as a remarkable experiment in science analysis and communication in 1988. (Here's a comprehensive paper by Alan Hecht and Dennis Tirpak putting the panel in broader context.)
But my views largely mesh with the conclusions of the review of the climate panel's procedures by the InterAcademy Council, the network of the world's national academies of science, which last year concluded:
Straying into advocacy can only hurt I.P.C.C.'s credibility.
The climate panel itself, in meetings earlier this year, largely embraced the council's conclusions and issued guidance for its administrative staff to create a communications plan:
...to support the "ability of the IPCC spokespersons to provide neutral and objective statements that are grounded in the assessments reports" as "this will be essential to preserving the trust and confidence placed in the IPCC by decisions makers and other key audiences."
Of course, similar issues have arisen when government scientists, most notably James E. Hansen of NASA, have become campaigners for particular policies on emissions and critics of those with other views or agendas.
But for the leadership of the climate panel, I see the bar as substantially higher. Hansen, as a citizen and government employee, can interpret the laws on professional obligations and personal rights as he sees fit and deal with the resulting plaudits and attacks.
As the panel's communication plan goes from outline to final form, it'll be great to see more clarity on how its leaders might work to clarify lines that are far too fuzzy today.
With that in mind, in late November the panel distributed a letter to governments and various organizations seeking input on its plan. I wish that invitation had gone out to the full range of users, including the public here and in other countries. As a starting point, feel free to read the current incarnation of the panel's communications strategy, and to offer ideas below.

In Today's Times:

        
House Speaker John A. Boehner rejected a short-term, bipartisan Senate measure to extend a payroll tax break and unemployment insurance, citing antipathy toward having only two months of tax policy, Jennifer Steinhauer reports. Opposition from the Republican leader sets the stage for a bitter year-end Congressional collision and the potential loss of benefits for millions of Americans.
        
Many in the Republican party respect Newt Gingrich for his achievement in leading the G.O.P. to control of Congress in 1994, but recoil from the prospect of him at the top of the presidential ticket, given the controversy, scandal and defeats that define Mr. Gingrich's four years as House speaker, Jackie Calmes reports. Some Republicans are beginning to go public with their concerns that Mr. Gingrich would be a weak general election candidate and a drag on the party's fortunes if he wins the nomination.
        
In what would be the final deal of his private equity career, Mitt Romney negotiated a retirement agreement with his former partners at Bain Capital that has paid him a share of the company's profits ever since, Nicholas Confessore, Christopher Drew and Julie Creswell report. The arrangement allowed Mr. Romney to pursue a career in public life while enjoying much of the financial upside of being a partner at a global investing behemoth.
Around the Web:

        
Newt Gingrich is beefing up his organization with the addition of a new political director, Politico reports. Martin Baker, a veteran G.O.P. operative, is expected to start work Monday.
        
Jon M. Huntsman Jr. has already declared himself the victor in the New Hampshire primary, Politico reports.

HEADLINE: Ad Spending Slowed to a Crawl in the 3rd Quarter, Report Finds

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The growth was a "barely palpable" 0.4 percent, Kantar Media reported. While midsize advertisers increased their spending, the largest companies decided to become very conservative in their spending. 

 BODY:
Like traffic on the way to the beach on a summer Friday afternoon, advertising spending in the third quarter barely moved, according to a report to be released on Monday morning.
But like that traffic, which eventually arrives at the beach, the spending in the third quarter among American advertisers did, indeed, inch forward when compared with the third quarter of 2010.
The report, from the Kantar Media unit of WPP, confirms suggestions made recently by several advertising forecasters that marketers had tapped the brakes during July, August and September.
But despite speculation that ad spending in the third quarter would actually decline - for the first quarter since 2009 - it, in fact, increased, according to Kantar Media, albeit by a scant 0.4 percent.
The slowdown in growth was fueled by a decision among the largest marketers to become "even more conservative with their ad budgets," said Jon Swallen, senior vice president for research at the Kantar Media North America unit of Kantar Media in New York.
Their pullback offset "the healthy spending growth occurring among midsize advertisers," Mr. Swallen said.
For instance, 8 of the 10 largest ad spenders in the third quarter reduced their outlays when compared with the same period of last year. The combined result for the Top 10 was a decline of 3.3 percent.
The nation's biggest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, and the second biggest, AT&T, each cut ad spending in the quarter by 0.7 percent, Kantar Media reported.
The largest reductions among the 10 leading advertisers in the quarter were made by Pfizer, No. 9, which was down 11.9 percent; and General Motors, No. 3, down 11.1 percent.
The only two marketers in the Top 10 that increased spending in the third quarter were L'Oreal, No. 6, up 18.1 percent; and the Chrysler Group, No. 8, which increased by 9.2 percent.
The 0.4 percent increase over all, which Mr. Swallen described as "barely palpable," is part of a pattern of deceleration for 2011; growth in ad spending has declined each quarter so far. The increases were 4.1 percent in the first quarter, and 2.8 percent in the second quarter.
For the first nine months of the year, Kantar Media reported, ad spending rose 1.5 percent from the same period of 2010.
As minuscule as the third-quarter gain was, ad spending in the United States has now grown for seven consecutive quarters since the end of 2009; the 0.4 percent increase is the smallest of the seven.
Looking at the third quarter by the type of media in which marketers spent their ad dollars, newspapers again took it on the chin.
Two forms of media related to newspapers endured the largest declines in ad spending in the third quarter. They were the free-standing inserts, mostly distributed through newspapers, which were down 6.4 percent, and newspaper media itself, which was down 3.7 percent.
Among the three kinds of newspaper media, only one, Spanish-language newspapers, grew in the quarter, by 2.9 percent. National newspapers fell 0.3 percent and local newspapers fell 4.4 percent.
Internet media, usually a growth category, also declined in the third quarter, according to the report, by 2.9 percent, as a drop in paid search of 14.4 percent offset a gain in display advertising of 15.8 percent.
The results for the rest of the media categories in the quarter were:

        
television media, up 3.2 percent;
        
magazine media, down 1.2 percent;
        
radio media, up 1.1 percent;
        
outdoor media, up 3.2 percent.
Looking at ad spending in the third quarter by categories, 7 of the top 10 gained, by percentages ranging from 2.1 percent, for automotive marketers (the biggest category), to 10.6 percent for direct-response marketers.
The categories that declined in the quarter were travel and tourism, down 4.4 percent; food and candy, down 5.7 percent; and telecommunications, down 6.1 percent.
Kantar Media is one of two large companies that track ad spending. The other, Nielsen, typically issues its quarterly reports after Kantar Media does.

HEADLINE: Polymetal Chief Hopes London Listing Spurs Deals

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: As the Russian gold and silver producer Polymetal joins a major British stock index, its chief executive, Vitaly N. Nesis, is seeking to attract international investors and expand its operations, mainly in the former Soviet Union. 

 BODY:
LONDON - As the Russian gold producer Polymetal joins a major British stock index, its chief executive is seeking to attract international investors and expand its operations, mainly in the former Soviet Union. 
On Monday, Polymetal and Evraz, a steel maker partly owned by the Russian billionaire Roman A. Abramovich, became the first Russian companies to be included in the FTSE 100 share index in London. Last month, Polymetal moved its main listing to London. 
The decision comes as its chief executive, Vitaly N. Nesis, has moved to remake the gold company into a more shareholder-friendly firm consistent with the practices of large international businesses. Bad corporate governance rather than local politics has been the biggest obstacle for Russian companies seeking to attract foreign capital, Mr. Nesis said on Monday.
 Polymetal, which owns silver and gold mines in Russia, had to appoint several independent directors to its board and sell more than 50 percent of the company on the stock market to qualify for the benchmark listing. Still, some analysts have expressed criticism that three shareholders, including Mr. Nesis's brother, still control a combined 45 percent of the company.
"I understand these concerns and there is always room to improve," Mr. Nesis said in an interview at the London Stock Exchange. But he added that changes must not be rushed and that "it was difficult for the large shareholders to accept the independence of the board, and that even when they act together they can't have the influence as before. It's a relatively lengthy thought process."
Mr. Nesis said he picked a stock listing in London rather than New York because British investors "are more familiar with Russia and understand the companies better." The higher regulatory cost associated with an American share listing was another reason, he said.
Mr. Nesis said investors in London "realize that the issue with Russian companies lies with corporate government not with the Russian government. In the U.S., people worry about political risk, which I don't think is important for Russia's economic development."
Street protests in Moscow challenging the recent election as well as corruption and judicial fraud prompted the country's stock market to drop over the last two weeks. Many investors were spooked by the short-term instability in the country even if Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin is widely expected to be elected president in March.
Mr. Nesis said he hoped "the situation in Russia would improve and that the protests would hopefully prompt them to do something about the most pressing problems."
Polymetal, which is based in St. Petersburg, plans to expand its operations, mainly in the former Soviet Union, Mr. Nesis said. 
"There's no reason for us to go to Latin America or Southeast Asia," he said. "The former Soviet Union is huge, and I feel we have enough opportunities for the next decade."
The company expects to take advantage of financing difficulties faced by some smaller rivals, which find it harder to get credit from banks or through selling equity. 
"It's a buyers' market," Mr. Nesis said. "I expect this to develop even more favorably for us in the next 12 months despite the high gold prices."
An earlier version stated that Vitaly N. Nesis, Polymetal's chief executive, was among the shareholders that own 45 percent. The group includes his brother.

HEADLINE: Britain Backs Banking Overhaul

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: By 2019, investment banking and retail banking operations in Britain would be different legal entities and financed separately, under the planned regulatory overhaul. 

 BODY:
LONDON -- The British government plans stricter banking regulations that would force banks to separate their investment banking operations from those businesses that take deposits.
The chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, said on Monday that the government would seek to pass laws by 2015 to strengthen financial regulation as proposed by an independent commission led by John Vickers, a former Bank of England chief economist. The new laws would then apply by 2019 the latest.
"These are the most far-reaching reforms of British banking in modern history," Mr. Osborne said in a speech to Parliament. The overhaul is intended to allow Britain to stay "home to one of the world's leading financial centers without exposing British taxpayers to the massive costs of those banks failing."
The new rules represent a bigger change for the banking industry here than the Dodd-Frank overhaul has meant for banks in the United States, some analysts have argued. Under the British regulations, investment banking and retail banking operations would be different legal entities and financed separately. The rules would also require banks to set aside a slightly bigger capital cushion than required by the Basel III regulations. Only Switzerland has asked its banks to hold more capital to absorb future potential losses so far.
British banks would have to shield deposits of individuals and small and medium-size companies in their consumer bank from investment banking activities, like trading. This means banks would no longer be able to use deposits to finance investment banking units. Investment banking businesses would also be allowed to fail without affecting the rest of the bank. The new rules would not apply to subsidiaries of non-British banks in Britain.
"Business models need to be fundamentally overhauled," Jon Pain, head of financial services risk consulting in Britain at KPMG, said. Major banks should not be "fooled" by the timetable as they "will need to make some serious decisions before June," he added.
Angela Knight, head of the British Bankers' Association, played down the impact of the changes, saying that the government's decision was just "the next stage of a program of reform" and that "banks have already made significant changes to how they operate."
Some banking executives have argued that the new rules will be expensive for the banks at a time when the industry is already struggling with sluggish growth and volatile markets. Some banks, including HSBC, have previously said they will consider moving their headquarters abroad if the new regulation is too punishing.
Mr. Osborne denied Monday that the rules would make London less attractive as a financial center.
He said the reforms were expected to cost the banking industry as much as 8 billion, or about $12 billion, because banks would no longer benefit from the perceived guarantee that the government would bail them out.
The government asked the Vickers commission last year to come up with proposals of how best to protect taxpayers from having to bail out financial institutions during any future banking crises. Britain's government spent more than $1 trillion bailing out ailing financial institutions during the recent financial crisis and still owns stakes in two of the country's largest banks, Royal Bank of Scotland and the Lloyds Banking Group.

HEADLINE: AT&T Ends $39 Billion Bid for T-Mobile

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: AT&#038;T acknowledged that it could not overcome opposition from the Obama administration to creating the nation's biggest cellphone service provider. 

 BODY:
AT&T on Monday ended its effort to buy T-Mobile USA, acknowledging that it could not overcome stiff opposition by the Obama administration to form the nation's biggest cellphone service provider.
The decision to scrap the $39 billion takeover - which would have been the biggest deal of the year - is a major setback for AT&T, which had pinned its hopes for growth on the acquisition. The company wanted T-Mobile's cellular airwaves, or spectrum, to relieve its congested network and offer faster service for data-hungry devices like the iPhone.
And the deal's end leaves T-Mobile, the weakest of the four national operators, with an uncertain future.
For the Obama administration, the collapse of the deal is confirmation that it has reinvigorated antitrust oversight that it said had become weak under its predecessor. The Justice Department took the aggressive step of suing to block the deal in late August, while the Federal Communications Commission had signaled its intent to fight the merger as well.
"People in this town didn't think that the department was willing to take the risk to litigate big, complex cases," said a senior Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because employees were not authorized to go beyond the department's public statement. "But this puts down a very firm marker that we are taking antitrust enforcement very seriously."
The company had sought to offer concessions to win regulatory approval, including potentially selling more than a quarter of T-Mobile's customers and spectrum to a competitor like Leap Wireless.
Other ideas included possible network-sharing agreements, though those were less fully developed.
After the F.C.C. declared its opposition to the deal, AT&T withdrew its application for approval from the agency on Thanksgiving. Last week, AT&T asked for a delay in the Justice Department lawsuit as it weighed its options.
By this last weekend, AT&T had concluded that no change to its bid would have been enough to pass muster, according to people briefed on the matter.
A merger of the two companies, consumer advocates had said, would have created a duopoly of AT&T and Verizon Wireless with almost three-quarters of the market between them.
"Consumers won today," Sharis A. Pozen, the Justice Department's acting assistant attorney general for antitrust, said in a statement. "Had AT&T acquired T-Mobile, consumers in the wireless marketplace would have faced higher prices and reduced innovation."
AT&T will pay Deutsche Telekom $4 billion in cash and wireless spectrum access as a break-up fee under the terms of the merger announced in March. After taxes, however, the financial hit to AT&T will be only about $1.5 billion, or roughly two months' worth of cash flow. The two companies will now begin a seven-year roaming agreement that will expand T-Mobile's national coverage.
That agreement, however, does not solve AT&T's network constraints. Nor does it shore up T-Mobile's diminishing competitive position. Deutsche Telekom has indicated that it would like to dispose of T-Mobile eventually, having failed to develop it into a stronger competitor to AT&T, Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel.
The push for a merger was spearheaded by Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T's chairman and chief executive, in his first bold strategic step since taking the reins in 2007.
To support the deal, AT&T lined up an assortment of lawmakers, corporate customers and local partners to promote the benefits of the merger.
But that campaign held little sway over government regulators, who were skeptical of arguments that uniting two of the nation's biggest wireless companies would not harm competition. The Justice Department joined with several state attorneys general in its antitrust lawsuit and hired prominent outside counsel. And the F.C.C. published its staff's 157-page internal report laying out its concerns about the deal.
AT&T had prepared for battle with the government, adopting at times an openly hostile stance toward the F.C.C. And few people thought the Justice Department would be able to fend off AT&T, whose Washington lobbying operation is legendary.
Still, the companies said from the beginning that they were willing to consider conditions that might be required to allow the deal to proceed. And the Justice Department had taken criticism for approving other big deals, including Comcast's takeover of NBCUniversal.
In the case of AT&T, Justice Department officials repeatedly signaled that they would oppose the deal, and finally sued the company in late summer.
On Monday, AT&T said it would continue to invest in expanding its network. But Mr. Stephenson warned lawmakers that they must take action to increase the availability of wireless spectrum to help expand faster cellular data coverage.
"The mobile Internet is a dynamic industry that can be a critical driver in restoring American economic growth and job creation, but only if companies are allowed to react quickly to customer needs and market forces," he said.
Analysts said that Deutsche Telekom must weigh the future of T-Mobile, including a potential sale of assets or an initial public offering.
One potential partner is Dish Network, the satellite TV provider. Its chief executive, Joseph Clayton , told Bloomberg News last week that his company was willing to pool its wireless holdings with T-Mobile's to create a stronger competitor to AT&T and Verizon.
"T-Mobile is probably going to be profoundly damaged by this," Tero Kuittinen, an independent research analyst, said. "They should have done some strategic rethinking instead of chasing this mirage, this dream of a merger. Now they've lost a lot of time."

HEADLINE: For Wall St.'s Big Players, the Holiday Party Is Still Over

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Goldman, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America shelve their official celebrations to avoid the costs and the criticism. 

 BODY:
Three years after the financial crisis, the Grinch still hovers over Wall Street.
In the precrisis era, big banks were renowned for their extravagant holiday parties. Goldman Sachs once rented out huge halls for its end-of-year galas, which featured appearances by performers such as Harry Connick Jr. and Bette Midler. In 2007, Morgan Stanley took over several floors of Lotus, then a popular Manhattan nightclub.
But, mindful of mass layoffs, flagging profits and sustained anger on Main Street, the nation's largest banks have canceled firm-sponsored celebrations or moved them in-house to avoid the costs and the criticism. 
 For the fourth year in a row, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have shelved their official holiday parties. The investment banking divisions of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America have also decided against them. But groups of employees at all five firms were permitted to hold - and pay for - their own festivities.
European firms, hit hard by the sovereign debt crisis, have also scaled back. The Royal Bank of Scotland, which is still part-owned by the British government, allowed some division heads to partially subsidize their employee parties with up to 10, or about $15, a person in company money. But employees in the American branches of the bank had to pay for their own parties this year, according to a company spokeswoman. 
Corporate holiday parties, in general, are on the wane. This year, only 74 percent of companies are holding them, down from 95 percent in 2006, according to a survey of 120 companies conducted by Amrop Battalia Winston, an executive search firm.
The dearth of company-sponsored holiday parties has jolted the owners of the bars, restaurants and lounges that housed the parties, the tabs for which could run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Steven Greenberg, the owner of 230 Fifth, a rooftop lounge in Manhattan, estimates that Wall Street nightlife used to account for 20 percent of his business. 
 Now, bank parties at 230 Fifth "are nonexistent, period," said Mr. Greenberg, though he said that business from foreign tourists has helped replace lost bookings. "They're concerned about doing layoffs and on the same day having a press report saying that they're having a big holiday party," he said.
Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan, and Citigroup all declined to comment.
With large American firms cutting back on holiday parties, private equity firms, hedge funds and others that operate farther from the public eye are taking their place. 
Bridgewater Associates, the giant hedge fund headquartered in Westport, Conn., rented out the Webster Bank Arena, a 10,000-seat arena in nearby Bridgeport, for its holiday party, according to several people with knowledge of the event. The Royal Bank of Canada held a party for its New York office at Chelsea Piers, in a high-end event space that can accommodate up to 2,000 guests, according to two people who attended but were not authorized to speak on the record about it. 
Credit Suisse's investment banking division held its celebration at Bar Basque, owned by the restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow. The bank provided an open bar and food including chicken parmesan sandwiches and fried olives.
 Still, even that party "paled in comparison to last year's," said a person who attended Credit Suisse's party and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
 At banks without official parties, some employees are making do with less.
 A group of Morgan Stanley employees held an unofficial holiday party with an "ugly sweater" theme at an Upper East Side bar, according to a person with knowledge of the event, while other employees of the firm partied at Dream, a hotel with a rooftop bar in Midtown Manhattan. A group of R.B.S. employees held an informal event at the Powerhouse Lounge in Jersey City.
 Other firms have emphasized charitable giving programs intended to draw attention to their good works. One year after holding a grand gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art to celebrate its 25th anniversary, the Blackstone Group, the private equity firm co-founded by Stephen A. Schwarzman, held a coat drive at its holiday party, a low-key affair in the Waldorf Astoria hotel, according to a person with knowledge of the event. 
 Those kinds of events can provide the morale boost of a holiday party without the reputational risks, experts say.
 "At this point, the crazy, expensive caviar nights don't make sense, but maybe something more subdued would be more appropriate," said Alison Brod, who runs a New York-based public relations firm. "It's pretty sad to do nothing."

HEADLINE: For Medicare, We Must Cut Costs, Not Shift Them

BYLINE: EZEKIEL J. EMANUEL


HIGHLIGHT: A plan to reform Medicare through "premium support" won't slow the growth of health care spending. 

 BODY:
Suddenly, everybody is talking about turning Medicare into a voucher program. It's not a new idea. It's been two decades since wonks first started talking seriously about "premium support" and the idea of replacing Medicare with a competitive marketplace in which older people could shop for health insurance. But the idea got new life last week when Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democrat with a long record on health care, joined Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee, in suggesting that such a scheme was the best way to cut health care spending while providing for the medical needs of the elderly. The plan resembles a proposal that Alice Rivlin, who was budget director under President Clinton, and Pete Domenici, a longtime Republican senator, have also recently been promoting.
Nobody questions that Medicare needs to be reformed. According to the Congressional Budget Office, by 2035 health care will be 26 percent of the total economy, and Medicare alone will be about 6 percent. If nothing is done to check its growth, federal health care spending will consume almost 40 percent of the budget, and could eventually bankrupt the government. But premium support plans aren't the way to reform Medicare. 
In the Wyden-Ryan proposal, the government would give each older citizen a certain amount of money - basically, a voucher - with which to buy a health insurance policy. The recipients would decide which policy to buy, based on whatever combination of benefits and price they found most appealing. If they chose a plan that cost more than the voucher, they would have to pay the difference. An earlier premium support plan by Mr. Ryan would have totally replaced traditional Medicare. This latest one would preserve Medicare as an option - although, critically, it would not guarantee that the voucher was enough to make Medicare affordable or ensure that private plans could not design a benefits package to attract only the healthiest patients. If this doesn't sound like the kind of sweeping reform that will save us it's because it isn't. 
Truth be told, I am not opposed to the government's providing Americans vouchers with which to buy health insurance. In 2005, Victor Fuchs, a health economist at Stanford, and I proposed a voucher plan that would apply to all Americans, and I still believe that universal vouchers could cut the cost of health care. But premium support for Medicare beneficiaries alone will not. 
Premium support is classic cost shifting, rather than cost cutting. Unless growth in health care costs is low, Medicare beneficiaries will just have to pick up the difference between the voucher's value and the cost of the health insurance plan they purchase. In fact, the original Ryan plan would have increased out-of-pocket costs for older people by more than $6,000 in 2022. And we can't depend on competition to bring costs down. Competition among insurance companies in general has not lowered them - in fact, from 1970 through 2009, Medicare spending per beneficiary grew at a slower rate than that of private health insurance. 
Many premium support plans contain a spending cap meant to check the growth of Medicare. But whether this works depends upon a very technical - but essential - point: How fast will the amount of the premium support grow? Will it grow with inflation? With gross domestic product? With overall health care spending? When they say the "devil is in the details" this is what they mean. Under the Rivlin-Domenici plan, the value of the voucher would be capped at the rate of overall economic growth plus one percentage point - less than health care inflation has historically been. The Wyden-Ryan plan replaces the voucher cap with an overall cap on Medicare spending using the same target. Excess spending would prompt cuts to doctors and other providers, or an increase in payments by wealthier Medicare beneficiaries.
And yet this change saves nothing in the federal budget. That is because the Affordable Care Act already created a mechanism to reduce spending in Medicare to the growth in gross domestic product plus one percentage point. Starting in 2020 the Independent Payment Advisory Board is required to submit proposals to cut Medicare spending if the growth in spending exceeds that level. However, the board is specifically prohibited from rationing care, raising taxes or premiums, increasing cost-sharing, restricting benefits or modifying eligibility - thereby protecting beneficiaries. Its proposals become law unless Congress or the president votes to institute other reforms that save as much money. 
The only way to gain additional savings is to cap the premium's growth at the same rate as the growth in G.D.P. or an even lower rate. But because this wouldn't decrease the cost of Medicare or the price of an insurance plan, it would end up shifting more and more costs to the elderly. 
One of the biggest problems in the Wyden-Ryan plan is a result of what is called adverse selection. If you pay an insurance company the same amount for all enrollees, it will want to avoid insuring sick people in order to save money. Under the Wyden-Ryan plan, insurance companies would have to accept both the healthy and the sick. But they would still compete to cover the healthiest Medicare beneficiaries, offering them desirable services like health club memberships, while leaving the rest to traditional Medicare. As a result, Medicare would end up with significantly higher costs. 
So if premium support plans aren't the answer, what should be done about Medicare? To address the root of the cost problem, we must change how we pay doctors and hospitals. We must move away from fee-for-service payments to bundled payments that include all the costs of caring for a patient, thereby encouraging providers to keep patients healthy and avoid unnecessary services. Medicare should announce that it will make this change by Jan. 1, 2022, and that it will begin by switching to bundled payments for cardiac and orthopedic surgery within one year and for cancer patients within five. 
Premium support will not reduce the government's costs without shifting those costs to older people who can't afford them. Only a plan that transforms how we pay doctors and other health care providers can do that.

HEADLINE: Cuts for the Already Retired

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Retired police and firefighters from Central Falls, R.I., have agreed to sharp pension cuts, a step thought to be unprecedented in municipal bankruptcy and one that could prompt similar attempts by other distressed governments.
If approved by the bankruptcy court, the agreement could be groundbreaking, said Matthew J. McGowan, the lawyer representing the retirees.
''This is the first time there's been an agreement of the police and firefighters of any city or town to take the cut,'' he said, referring to those already retired, who are typically spared when union contracts change. ''I've told these guys they're like the canary in the coal mine. I know that there are other places watching this.''
As cities, towns and counties struggle with fiscal pain, there has been speculation that they could shed their pension obligations in bankruptcy. Some have said it might, in fact, be easier for local governments to drop those obligations than it is for companies, which use a different chapter of the bankruptcy code. Large steel companies, airlines and auto suppliers like Delphi have terminated pension plans in bankruptcy. 
''But it's a fight that municipalities haven't been willing to fight,'' said David Skeel, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who writes frequently on bankruptcy.
Municipalities have been reluctant because public pensions are protected by statutes and constitutional provisions meant to make them nearly airtight. And even if the rules could be broken in bankruptcy, that would present a different problem. Local officials who want to cut pensions do not, as a rule, want to shortchange their bondholders for fear of not being able to borrow in the future -- yet bankruptcy law requires that both types of creditors be treated equitably.
Rhode Island sought to sidestep the issue with a law that gave bondholders more protections than retirees. Central Falls's retirees used that issue to gain some bargaining power, extracting a commitment from the state to seek extra money for the next five years. The extra money is not a sure thing, though, and would not cover all the cuts to the retirees over those years.
The last American city to work its way through Chapter 9 bankruptcy was Vallejo, Calif., which finished the process this year. It had to navigate similar stumbling blocks. Initially, it planned to cut its workers' and retirees' pensions, but it changed course when California's giant state pension system, which administered Vallejo's plan, threatened a costly and debilitating court battle.
Vallejo instead cut pay, health care and other benefits, as well as city services and payments to its bondholders, and left the pensions intact. Even though the bondholders faced a loss, all parties eventually agreed they had been treated equitably, and the state passed a law making it easier for Vallejo to continue borrowing.
The episode strengthened the perception that public retirement plans were unalterable, even in bankruptcy.
''Central Falls is undermining that,'' said Mr. Skeel, who wrote about Vallejo's bankruptcy for a coming issue of The University of Chicago Law Review.
Central Falls had little choice. For years, its government failed to contribute enough to its police and firefighters' pension fund, and the fund effectively ran out of money this fall. The city, which had also promised the retirees comprehensive health benefits, could not cover the pension and health payments out of its general revenue.
The police and firefighters have known for months that drastic cuts were looming. Last month, the unions representing active workers negotiated new contracts, which called for workers to complete at least 25 years to receive pensions, instead of 20. Workers will also have to meet much more rigorous standards to qualify for disability pensions.
Until now, 60 percent of Central Falls police officers and firefighters have retired on full disability pensions, drawing the inflation-protected and tax-free payments even when they embarked on new careers. One of them, at 43, has become a prominent personal-injury lawyer and can be seen in television ads shooting baskets and pretending to fall down a manhole. That retiree, Robert Levine, a former police officer, said his disability was the result of an on-duty car crash where he was not at fault, and that his pension had been granted lawfully after his condition was certified by three different doctors.
The retirees, who are not represented by the unions, voted in favor of their pension reductions last week. The cuts would be up to 55 percent of each retiree's benefits, which now vary widely, from about $4,000 to $46,000 a year, depending on final salary, years of service and other factors. A few retirees would give up more than $25,000 a year. Central Falls's police and firefighters do not participate in Social Security.
The new agreement also reduces the annual cost-of-living adjustments and requires retirees to start contributing toward the cost of their health benefits. But it does not take disability pensions away from retirees -- something that could become a sticking point.
In the negotiations, the state's revenue director promised to seek money from the state -- enough to pay most retirees a supplement of several thousand dollars a year for five years.
Having recently enacted a big and painful package of pension cuts for state workers and teachers, Rhode Island legislators say they are in no mood to help a city's retirees who stripped their own pension fund, often collecting disability pensions when they were well enough to work.
The retirees' lawyer, Mr. McGowan, won support for the state money by threatening to challenge a state law enacted just before Central Falls declared bankruptcy last summer. The law protects holders of general-obligation bonds issued by Rhode Island and its municipalities by giving them priority in bankruptcy. Without the law, investors could find themselves subject to the same losses as the retirees.
The state law was intended to prevent a contagion effect, in which Central Falls's bankruptcy would frighten investors away from other cities' bonds, driving up borrowing costs across the state.
The idea of shielding municipal bondholders during bankruptcy is controversial, however.
''It's not clear to me that you ought to be protecting bondholders,'' said Mr. Skeel. ''It seems unfair to me that you're singling out one type of creditor to bear the burden, and another type not to.''
Mr. McGowan, the retirees' lawyer, said he had threatened to sue Central Falls's bondholders on the argument that the state law had given them a ''voidable fraudulent transfer''-- an abusive deal that could be undone by a bankruptcy court. He said the state did not want such a challenge, so it agreed to push for pension supplements.
Theodore Orson, who represents Central Falls's state-appointed receiver in the bankruptcy, said negotiations would have been impossible without the law. He said he thought Chapter 9 should be amended to give cities the ability to shield their bondholders if they could show a compelling need to do so. But that would take an act of Congress, and federal lawmakers, at odds over their own debt and deficit, show no interest in taking on the cities' fiscal woes.
''One thing I think we've demonstrated in Rhode Island is, we really have a functional state government,'' Mr. Orson said. ''We are pulling together and making what we believe to be difficult decisions that you don't see Congress making right now.''

HEADLINE: Seattle Bans Plastic Bags, and Sets a Charge for Paper

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
SEATTLE -- The City Council here voted unanimously on Monday to ban plastic grocery bags and charge a 5-cent fee on paper bags -- and this time city leaders hope the ban actually takes effect. 
Three years ago, Seattle city officials became the first in the nation to approve a fee on paper and plastic bags, instituting a charge of 20 cents for each bag provided by many retail stores. The idea was to create a financial incentive to reduce pollution: the fee was supposed to prompt people to bring reusable bags with them to shop.
But before the 2008 fee took effect, the plastic-bag industry led a petition drive that forced the issue onto a citywide ballot. In August 2009, in the midst of the recession and after the industry spent $1.4 million on the campaign, Seattle voters rejected the fee.
''Twenty cents felt kind of punitive, especially for low-income folks,'' said Mike O'Brien, a council member whose committee introduced the current bill.
Instead of becoming a leader on the issue, Seattle watched as other cities moved forward with bans and fees.
''There's a competitive side to seeing who can come up with the most progressive legislation,'' said Mr. O'Brien, who was a local Sierra Club leader, and a candidate for the Council, when the bag fee was on the ballot.
Now Seattle is the fourth city in the state to approve a ban, modeling its measure closely on one approved this year in Bellingham. Some larger cities, including San Francisco, Washington and Portland, Ore., have also instituted bans and fees. But plenty of places are still wrestling with the subject. In Los Angeles, the City Council has studied the issue for four years.
Arguments persist about the environmental drawbacks and benefits of each type of bag. Mr. O'Brien said one reason the Council was allowing paper bags was because the city has one of the highest rates in the nation for paper bag recycling, about 85 percent, while it recycles only about 13 percent of the 292 million plastic bags distributed in the city. Under the ban, plastic bags could still be provided for produce and bulk grocery items.
Many of the area's largest grocers and retailers support the new measure. But it is opposed by the plastic bag industry. An industry spokesman said Monday that it had not decided whether it would try to put the measure before voters yet again.
Mark Daniels, vice president of sustainability and environmental policy for Hilex Poly, a plastics maker and recycler, said bans were ''badly misguided efforts.''
He added, ''Moving consumers away from plastic bags only pushes people to less environmentally friendly options such as paper bags, which require more energy to produce and transport, and reusable bags, which are not recyclable.''

HEADLINE: Once Sued, Many Are Twice Shy

BYLINE: By PAULINE W. CHEN, M.D.

 BODY:
Within months of completing my training, I received the call that every doctor dreads.
''You've been named in a malpractice lawsuit,'' said the hospital administrator on the other end of the line.
The family of a patient I had seen briefly a year before believed that a colleague's decision not to operate hastened her demise. Now their lawyers, combing through the medical records, believed that a single sentence in my note brought that doctor's decision into question. As a second or maybe even third opinion, I had written that the woman was a ''possible candidate'' for surgery.
The truth was that when I saw her she was a possible candidate, but only tenuously so. In fact, her health deteriorated so rapidly that by the time she finished seeing all the specialists and returned to her original surgeon, the chances of her surviving any treatment, no matter how heroic, were almost nil. 
Though I knew all that, in the weeks after that telephone call I couldn't help questioning myself, going over the case in my mind as soon as I woke up, then again and again late into the night. I froze with fear every time I was asked for my opinion on a diagnosis or treatment plan and became a master at evasion, littering my assessments and write-ups with words like ''maybe,'' ''perhaps'' and ''will await further work-up.'' And I wondered if my colleagues knew, if the blot on my record had already soaked through the fabric of my professional reputation.
In the end, the family dropped the case; I never met with any lawyers or went to court. But memories of the all-encompassing threat of a claim came flooding back when I read a recent study of how litigation affects doctors.
Medical malpractice lawsuits have existed in the United States for more than 150 years, though today, most medical errors are never pursued in court, and a large majority of claims never result in any kind of payment to patients. And even though the direct and indirect costs of such suits account for only 2.4 percent of total health care costs, that's still $55 billion yearly. To say nothing of the even more important social costs, an issue addressed last month in The Journal of the American College of Surgeons.
Researchers surveyed more than 7,000 surgeons and found that nearly one in four were in the midst of litigation. Surgeons involved in a recent lawsuit were more likely to suffer from depression and burnout, including feelings of emotional exhaustion and detachment, a low sense of accomplishment and even thoughts of suicide.
''Malpractice is at the top of the list of major stressors for most physicians,'' said Dr. Charles M. Balch, the lead author and a professor of surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. ''It's right up there with financial distress, serious work-home conflicts and life-and-death circumstances.''
Other studies estimate that, depending on the specialty, anywhere from 75 percent to 99 percent of practicing doctors will over the course of a lifetime be threatened with a lawsuit. ''We are not talking about some small subset of physicians who are vulnerable because they are weak,'' said Dr. Tait D. Shanafelt, a co-author and associate professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. ''Malpractice affects a wide swath of our colleagues and their patients.''
Doctors who have been sued may end up practicing defensive medicine, ordering unnecessary tests and medications or refusing to treat patients with more complex illnesses altogether as a safeguard against future litigation. Those same doctors can also become burned out, which can lead to even more errors, and more malpractice claims.
''Burnout may be what reinforces the connections between malpractice, defensive medicine and poor-quality care,'' said Amitabh Chandra, a professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and an economist who has written extensively on medical malpractice.
The study authors propose that one way to disrupt the negative cycle is to improve communication between patients and doctors, so that patients are aware of the risks that can occur despite a doctor's best efforts. Another important step is instituting programs that continue those conversations even after an error occurs. ''We need supportive work environments and more programs that allow doctors and patients to resolve issues directly,'' Dr. Balch said.
But change will require looking at malpractice reform in a new way, one that gives weight not just to the economic costs but to the ways reform might affect how patients and doctors interact.
''Ultimately we are dealing with doctors who are working under enormous pressures,'' Dr. Chandra said. ''For them, the emotional costs are colossal.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Jobs Created by a Pipeline

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Keystone Claptrap'' (editorial, Dec. 13): In the wake of our economic struggles, the United States has been looking for ways to grow our economy and put Americans back to work. There aren't many obvious solutions, but the Keystone XL oil pipeline is one of them. 
The developer of the pipeline, TransCanada, says it will create 20,000 construction and manufacturing jobs in the United States, and a report by the Perryman Group indicates that we would see an additional 118,000 indirect jobs. Nearly 1,000 companies in 47 states will have a hand in building this pipeline -- injecting $20 billion into our economy, according to TransCanada.
Manufacturers are a vital sector of the American economy and use one-third of our nation's energy supply. Affordable energy is critical to their ability to remain competitive in the global marketplace.
The State Department has done exhaustive studies on the environmental impact of the pipeline and has found no significant risks.
We need neither the political theater that has accompanied this project nor the attacks calling construction jobs temporary because they have a project completion date. The Keystone XL pipeline will mean jobs and economic growth for Americans and not for workers in other countries.
JAY TIMMONS TERRY O'SULLIVAN Washington, Dec. 14, 2011

HEADLINE: Iran Admits Western Sanctions Are Inflicting Damage

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Artin Afkhami contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Iran's veneer of stoicism toward the Western sanctions that have disrupted its economy showed some new strains on Monday, as the deputy oil minister acknowledged a decline in domestic petroleum production because of dwindling foreign investment, and four-year-old talks between the Iranians and Poland's biggest natural gas developer collapsed.
The Iranians also suffered an embarrassment after prematurely announcing that a Russian oil company had committed $1 billion to help revive a dormant oil field in Iran's southwest. Hours later, the Russian company, Tatneft, denied on its Web site that a deal had been signed. And there were signals that Saudi Arabia, which Iran had confidently predicted last week would not increase oil production to compensate for any Iranian shortfall caused by the sanctions, was becoming increasingly irritated with Iran. 
Together, the developments portrayed Iran, with the world's fourth-largest oil reserves and second-largest natural gas reserves, as struggling more than it had admitted from the effects of the Western sanctions, despite its official denunciations of them as desperate measures doomed to fail or backfire.
The sanctions, imposed to pressure Iran into ending its suspect nuclear program, were strengthened last month, with the possibility of more onerous restrictions on Iran's central bank and oil industry looming from the United States and the European Union. Under a measure that is likely to be signed into law by President Obama, foreign entities that do business with Iran's central bank, the conduit for Iran's oil revenue, could face severe penalties if they do business in the United States.
Iran's deputy oil minister, Ahmad Qalebani, appeared to have made an unusual disclosure about the effects of sanctions in an article reported by the official Iranian Students' News Agency, which quoted him as saying Iran's crude oil production in 2011 had declined from the year before. He said the decline was ''due to lack of investment in oil field development.''
Iran produced about 4 million barrels a day of oil in 2010 and is producing about 3.5 million barrels this year.
Mr. Qalebani's disclosure followed recent warnings by other Iranian officials that the effects of sanctions had become more acute. The foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, was quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency as saying, ''We cannot pretend the sanctions are not having an effect.'' The governor of Iran's central bank, Mahmoud Bahmani, told reporters in Iran last week that the country must act as if it were ''under siege,'' Agence France-Presse reported.
The collapsed talks on a deal with Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo, a leading developer and distributor of natural gas, involved the Lavan natural gas field in the Persian Gulf, one of Iran's largest deposits. Iran's semiofficial Mehr News Agency said the Polish company would be replaced by a consortium of Iranian companies. It was unclear precisely why the talks failed, but the withdrawal of the Polish company clearly reflected the new pressures on foreign companies not to engage in commitments with Iran.
Even Russia, which has strongly opposed the Western sanctions against Iran, appeared to be backtracking on a deal after Iranian news agencies said Tatneft had signed a $1 billion agreement to develop the Zagheh field in southern Iran. The company said in a statement that it had ''not entered into any agreements, contracts'' and had ''not accepted any other undertakings relating to oil and gas projects in Iran.''
Additional pressure aimed at Iran came from Saudi Arabia, Iran's wary neighbor and oil-producing rival. Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, in remarks clearly aimed at Iran, told a meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a six-member group of Arab oil producers, ''No doubt you all know that we are targeted in our safety and security.''

HEADLINE: For Exiles, Iraq Beckons And Repels

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO; Omar al-Jawoshy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- Ali al-Subiahi returned from his family's self-imposed exile in the United States to reclaim a sense of himself in a new Iraq.
At 26, he runs a string of private schools in Baghdad, bankrolled by his earnings as an interpreter for the United States military. He has adapted, showing what he considers an American entrepreneurial flair, advertising for his schools on blast walls left from the bloodiest days of the war.
As an American citizen, and a former military employee, he remains fearful for his life. But as an Iraqi, and a Muslim, he finds living here easier than in his family's new home in Lincoln, Neb., where strip clubs, liquor stores and churches are part of the nearby suburban landscape.
''Besides security, life is simpler over here,'' he said as he sat surrounded by textbooks in one of his schools in Dora, a neighborhood that only a few years ago was a sectarian battleground. ''I understand people better.'' 
The Subiahi family fled Saddam Hussein's Iraq in 1999 when his father became a wanted man for opposing the government. Family members later cheered their adopted country's invasion of their homeland. Then, like other Americans, they watched, helpless, as a war that was supposed to be short and triumphal dragged on.
Over time, their future dimmed, the victim of America's increasing wariness of its Muslims and economic shocks that punished immigrants and nonimmigrants alike.
Now, with the departure of the last group of American soldiers from Iraq, the watershed moment for the United States is becoming an emotional turning point for the family as well.
Mr. Subiahi's youngest brother, a teenager, cannot imagine leaving the United States; an increasingly devout sister is not sure she can stay. Two other siblings are waffling.
Their mother is in Iraq, at least for now, to help set up Mr. Subiahi's schools, which are financing the family home in Nebraska.
His father will not budge.
''I am American,'' he said recently. ''Our religion says that your home is where you are welcomed.''
Ali al-Subiahi's school in Dora is in a clean and well-kept villa just up the road from a police checkpoint. The neighborhood was once home to a large Christian population, but most Christians left during the sectarian bloodletting that peaked in 2006 and 2007.
He said he originally came back to Iraq, in 2004, for money; he could earn nearly $10,000 a month as an interpreter.
But the longer he remained, the more he wanted to make a difference. And, he said, his horizons were more limited in the United States.
A high school graduate, he felt his options were working at McDonald's or following the path of many an immigrant and starting a business. He and his brother-in-law tried running a small grocery, but they said they gave up because taxes were too high to make a profit.
''I lost faith in the States as far as opening a small business,'' said Mr. Subiahi, who gave a blistering critique of America's financial priorities. ''They take care of the really poor people who can't afford bread or who don't want to work, or they take care of the wealthy people.''
Gesturing toward his mother, Haifaa, he said she could find only menial work in the United States, even though she had been a school principal in Iraq. ''In one country, you work as a cafeteria worker, and in one country, you are a school principal,'' he said. ''Where would you rather be?''
That is not to say returning has been easy.
The war claimed the lives of eight members of his extended family, casualties of a civil war whose premise -- identification by sect -- was a concept the family had not dwelled on before. Mr. Subiahi did not even know his background until he was asked on the application to be an interpreter. (His father is Shiite; his mother is Sunni.)
He can't even go out at night for a pack of cigarettes without worrying his mother, who knows that many Iraqi interpreters for the United States have been targeted as traitors.
She greets his every return with the same words: ''Thank God you are back.''
The family home in Lincoln is a comfortable suburban house with a brick front and cream-colored shutters, a world away from Iraq's disrepair.
Ali's father, Hussein al-Subiahi, is the master of the house, although it is in his son's name. A proud man who sometimes speaks of himself in the third person, Hussein walks with a limp from being shot during Iraq's war with Iran in the 1980s.
As he showed off his adopted hometown, the senior Mr. Subiahi recounted his family's journey. He was an air force officer when he heard a rumor that he was on a list of assassination targets for allegations he plotted against the government. Having seen Saddam Hussein's cruelties up close, he took no chances. The family escaped to Syria through the mountains of Kurdistan and began casting about for a permanent home.
''No one accepted us -- Jordan, Saudi, Egypt,'' Mr. Subiahi said. ''No one accepted us, just the United States.''
When the family arrived in the United States, he told his children and wife to ''forget Iraq.'' Now, with the war over, he lives among signs of the family's divide over which country is really theirs.
In Ali's room, passages from the Koran hang on the wall, and the closet is stuffed with mementos of his military service: a helmet, photos with his Marine buddies.
Ali's youngest brother, Mahmoud, surrounds himself with all things American. A junior at Lincoln East High School, he favors baggy jeans in the style of some rappers. He visited Iraq briefly after the American invasion and decided he hated it and would never return.
Their 31-year-old married sister, Shaimaa, lives across town, not far from the grocery Ali gave up.
Shaimaa has been increasingly tempted to return to Iraq since she began wearing a hijab three years ago and immediately noticed people's cooling toward her.
In Iraq, she reasons, it will be easier to raise her daughter as a proper Muslim, one who ''can keep her virginity until she is married.''
Even the family patriarch, Hussein, acknowledges that America can be an uncomfortable fit.
He has never found steady work in Nebraska. And he is angry that some fellow Americans appear to blame all Muslims for the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. ''America destroyed Vietnam, and we don't say Christians destroyed Vietnam,'' he said.
Still, he returns, always, to the gratitude he feels for being given a new homeland.
Scrolling through old photographs on a computer, he stops at one of him and some friends taken in Kirkuk in 1977.
Everyone in it suffered in Iraq's turmoil. Two were killed in the war with Iran; another spent a year in an Iranian jail. He flipped to another picture: an Iraqi general he knew.
His fate: ''Nobody knows.''
Ali is more focused on Iraq's future than its past, and his story is perhaps a small measure of hope for the eventual return of Iraq's educated middle class, once the backbone of a cosmopolitan society.
By opening schools (four so far), he is hoping to help lay a foundation for a freer Iraq.
He notes that the schools are open to all sects, all religions, even nonbelievers.
But there are some subjects he cannot touch. The curriculum is still dictated by the Ministry of Education, and that means lessons on Saddam's tyranny or the American war are off limits; bureaucrats say schoolchildren are not ready for a reckoning with their country's recent, tortured past.
Ali does not pretend that his motives are all high-minded; he came for upward mobility and is finding it. In the business's first year in operation last year, he earned $75,000, tens of thousands of dollars more than he might have made flipping burgers.
For his father, the legacy of the war is clear. ''When I hear from people in my tribe, they say, 'Please bless the United States, please bless George Bush for our freedom,' '' he said.
Ali does not disagree. He summed up life in the old Iraq with a chilling comment on the depth of fear: ''If you hated Saddam, you couldn't even say it to yourself. Your conscience might go and snitch.''
He is simply having more trouble than his father piecing the two halves of his life together and deciding which country he will ultimately choose.
The choice may not be entirely his. His future, like the fate of the American legacy here, will be written in the war's epilogue, which started when the last of America's soldiers crossed the border into Kuwait, leaving Iraqis to decide whether they can live together in peace.

PERSON: Warren Hellman 

HEADLINE: Warren Hellman, 77, Investor Who Loved Bluegrass, Dies

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Warren Hellman, a Wall Street investor who was president of Lehman Brothers and whose passion for bluegrass inspired him to create a San Francisco music festival that draws hundreds of thousands of people a year, died on Sunday in San Francisco. He was 77.
The cause was complications of leukemia, according to a spokeswoman for Hellman & Freidman, the investment firm he co-founded. 
Mr. Hellman, whose parents came from two prominent San Francisco families, had a finance career on both coasts. After nearly 20 years at Lehman in New York, he started several money management businesses, including Hellman & Friedman in San Francisco, one of the country's most successful private equity funds.
More recently Mr. Hellman focused on philanthropy, bestowing millions of dollars on cultural, educational and medical charities in the Bay Area.
The three-day concert he founded, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, held each year in Golden Gate Park, has been financed entirely by him.
Wiry, impish and informal -- he favored frayed khakis and cowboy shirts -- Mr. Hellman was something of a free spirit. He traveled around the country with his bluegrass band, the Wronglers, performing with them as recently as October. An accomplished endurance athlete, he twice completed a 100-mile running race through the Sierra Nevada mountains.
''Warren was an individualist,'' said James D. Wolfensohn, the former president of the World Bank and a business-school classmate of Mr. Hellman's. ''He had the confidence and access that comes along with being from a prominent family, but never rested on his laurels and lived the life he wanted.''
Frederick Warren Hellman was born on July 25, 1934, in Manhattan. He was not, as many assumed, an heir to the Hellmann's mayonnaise fortune; his pedigree was in the finance and rag trades. His father was Marco F. Hellman, an investment banker. His mother was the former Ruth Koshland, whose relatives were prosperous wool merchants in California.
His great-grandfather, Isaias W. Hellman, was a Jewish immigrant from Bavaria who became one of California's leading financiers and served as president of Wells Fargo Nevada National Bank, which later became Wells Fargo.
Mr. Hellman grew up in San Francisco and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, where he played varsity water polo. After graduating from Harvard Business School in 1959, he joined Lehman Brothers, where his uncle, Frederick L. Ehrman, was a senior executive and later chairman.
An aggressive dealmaker at Lehman, Mr. Hellman earned the nickname Hurricane Hellman. At 26, he became the youngest partner in the firm's history, and in 1973, at 39, president. The firm's partners ousted Mr. Ehrman that year, and Mr. Hellman had to deliver the news to his uncle.
In Ken Auletta's 1985 book, ''Greed and Glory on Wall Street: The Fall of the House of Lehman,'' Mr. Hellman is quoted as saying that he couldn't recall the expression on Mr. Ehrman's face because he had stared at his uncle's feet for the entire conversation. (He clearly remembered that Mr. Ehrman's socks were gray and bunched around his ankles, however.)
After leaving Lehman in 1977, Mr. Hellman moved to Boston, where he helped start two investment firms: Hellman, Jordan, a manager of stock portfolios; and a venture capital fund that invested in start-up technology companies. That fund, now called Matrix Partners, was an early backer of Apple Computer.
After moving back to San Francisco, Mr. Hellman and Tully Friedman, an investment banker at Salomon Brothers, started Hellman & Friedman in 1984. He said he had set out to build a firm that did the exact opposite of Lehman, which he described as nasty and corrosive.
With Hellman & Friedman he orchestrated its buyout of Levi Strauss as well as its investments in the Nasdaq and the advertising company Young & Rubicam. Today the firm's holdings include the media companies Getty Images and Nielsen.
Until recently Mr. Hellman arose daily at 4:30 a.m. for a 16-mile run through the Presidio before heading into the office. He was a five-time age group national champion in ride and tie, a combination of cross-country running and horseback riding. In the 1970s he co-founded the Stratton Mountain School in Vermont for competitive junior skiers and later served as president of the United States ski team.
He gradually turned over the management of Hellman & Friedman to his partners and concentrated on civic pursuits, among them the construction of an underground parking garage in Golden Gate Park and providing the financial backing for The Bay Citizen, a nonprofit local news organization that provides content to The New York Times.
Banjo picking and bluegrass were his longtime loves, and in 2001 he hosted a one-day free concert featuring Emmylou Harris and Alison Krauss. Hardly Strictly Bluegrass is now a three-day event that draws more than 750,000 people a year, its organizers say. And it offers more than bluegrass; the rock stars Elvis Costello, Patti Smith and John Mellencamp have been among the performers. It has also featured the Wronglers, Mr. Hellman's band, which released an album this year, ''Heirloom Music,'' with Jimmie Dale Gilmore.
Last week, city officials renamed Speedway Meadow, the site of the festival, Hellman's Hollow.
Mr. Hellman's wife of 56 years, Chris, survives him, as do four children, Mick, Tricia Gibbs, Frances Hellman and Judith Hellman; 12 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.
In 2009, Mr. Hellman and his daughter Tricia, a doctor, celebrated a joint bar and bat mitzvah, ceremonies typically for 13-year-olds. Though he began studying the Torah in the 1980s, Mr. Hellman grew up secular, and neither he nor his children or grandchildren had had a bar mitzvah.
Mr. Hellman told a local Jewish weekly newspaper that the ritual -- during which he wore a yarmulke bearing a ''Cal'' logo, an homage to his alma mater -- had connected him to his past.
''After 75 years, I have come home,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Backs Apple In Patent Ruling That Hits Google

BYLINE: By NICK WINGFIELD

 BODY:
A federal agency ruled on Monday that a set of important features commonly found in smartphones are protected by an Apple patent, a decision that could force changes in how Google's Android phones function.
The ruling, by the United States International Trade Commission, is one of the most significant so far in a growing array of closely watched patent battles being waged around the globe by nearly all of the major players in the mobile industry. These fights reflect the heated competition among the companies, especially as Android phones gain market share.
At the heart of the disputes are the kind of small but convenient features that would cause many people to complain if they were not in their smartphones. For example, the case decided Monday involves the technology that lets you tap your finger once on the touch screen to call a phone number that is written inside an e-mail or text message. It also involves the technology that allows you to schedule a calendar appointment, again with a single tap of the finger, for a date mentioned in an e-mail. 
HTC, the defendant in the case and a Taiwan-based mobile phone maker using the Android system, said in a statement after the ruling that it would adapt its features to comply with the court's decision. The company called them ''small'' parts of the user's experience.
The ruling was only a partial victory for Apple because the commission overruled an earlier decision in Apple's favor in the case, involving a different, more technical patent related to how software is organized internally on mobile devices. It would have been hard for HTC to adapt its devices to avoid infringing that patent, legal experts said.
The decision could potentially affect far more phones than those made by HTC because the underlying target of the suit is Google, creator of the Android system that now powers more than half of all smartphones sold worldwide. Apple is suing several other makers of Android devices, as is Microsoft, and companies that make Android products are returning the favor in most instances through countersuits.
''It's an important victory for Apple, but it's just one of many battles,'' said Alexander Poltorak, chief executive of the General Patent Corporation, an intellectual property strategy firm, adding that the ruling will pressure other Android phone makers to license the technology from Apple or make changes to avoid patent infringement issues.
The ruling by the six-member commission, which can take action against unfair trade practices by companies whose products are imported into the United States, will prevent HTC from selling phones in the United States that infringe the patent starting April 19.
To take effect, President Obama's trade representative must sign the order. He could decide to overrule the commission's finding, though such actions are rare. It also can be appealed.
Apple has also sued HTC in federal court accusing it of patent infringement, while HTC has filed suits of its own against Apple with the trade commission and in federal court.
The patent battles reflect the intense competition in the smartphone market. In the third quarter of 2011, phones running the Android system accounted for 52.5 percent of devices sold worldwide, up from 25.3 percent in the period of 2010. Apple's share of this market fell to 15 percent, from 16.6 percent, in the same period.
Apple's late chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, was outspoken in saying that Google had improperly copied many of the iPhone's innovations, telling his biographer that he was going to ''destroy Android, because it's a stolen product.''
After the ruling on Monday, Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, said, ''We think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours.''
Grace Lei, HTC's general counsel, said in a statement that the company was happy the commission ruled against Apple on other patents involved in the case. ''We are very pleased with the determination and we respect it,'' Ms. Lei said.
A Google spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
The growing complexity of mobile devices has greatly expanded the range of patents that can be used as weapons in the business, and their robust sales have made them a lucrative target.
Florian Mueller, an intellectual property analyst in Germany and author of a popular blog on patents estimates that the number of patent lawsuits related to the mobile business worldwide is approaching 100.
In addition to antenna designs and other traditional patents that are held by cellular companies, relative newcomers to the business, like Apple and Microsoft, are using patents that originated from computer products. Apple applied for one of the patents at issue in the HTC case -- for detecting phone numbers and other forms of data -- in 1996, 11 years before the iPhone was released.
''Convergence threw them all together and opened up new product opportunities,'' said James E. Bessen, an economist and lecturer at the Boston University School of Law.
The HTC Corporation sold more than 12 million cellphones in the third quarter, according to Gartner. That made the company the world's seventh-largest seller of cellphones, ahead of Motorola and just behind Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry. Its phones include the Droid Incredible, an Android phone sold by Verizon Wireless and the HTC Titan, which has the Windows Phone operating system and is sold by AT&T.
HTC said it would comply with the commission's ruling by removing a feature that currently gives users a list of options whenever they receive, say, a phone number in a message on their smartphones. The users will no longer get a menu giving them the choice to save the phone number in their contact lists, dial the number or send a text message to it. Instead, HTC said it would give them only the option of dialing the number.
United States Customs and Border Protection will determine whether HTC's changes are sufficient to comply with the ruling.
Apple is thought to have sued HTC, along with Samsung, another maker of Android phones and tablets, rather than Google itself because those companies profit directly from the sale of Android products. Patent lawyers say a frontal assault on Google would be a tougher legal challenge because the company gives away its Android operating system to hardware makers, making money instead through advertising from Internet services on Android phones.
Oracle has sued Google directly, accusing it of patent infringement through Android. The British telecom provider BT on Monday said it also sued Google, in part over alleged patent infringements in Android.
Patent lawsuits among technology companies typically end up being settled or avoided entirely through cross-licensing deals, with the weaker party often agreeing to pay a licensing royalty on every product sold containing the technology in question. Microsoft, for example, signed licensing agreements with HTC, Samsung and other companies in which Microsoft receives an undisclosed royalty from the sale of their Android devices.
Apple appears less motivated by getting royalties from the companies it is suing, though some patent experts believe that could be posturing on its part. Mr. Jobs's criticisms took on more urgency as Android began to gain a bigger share of the smartphone market during the last two years.
But when he expressed those criticisms to his biographer, Walter Isaacson, he said he told Eric E. Schmidt, now the executive chairman of Google and a former Apple board member, that he didn't want money from Google.
''If you offer me $5 billion, I won't want it,'' Mr. Jobs told Mr. Schmidt, according to the book, ''Steve Jobs.'' ''I've got plenty of money. I want you to stop using our ideas in Android, that's all.''
Mr. Mueller, the patent analyst, says he believes Apple is unlikely to settle with its Android rivals because it has the most of any company to lose from the rise of Android. ''The Apple rhetoric from the beginning was about theft of intellectual property,'' said Mr. Mueller, who has done research work for Microsoft, a Google competitor. ''That's a lot more combative.''
Google has amped up its own rhetoric as well. In early August, David Drummond, the company's senior vice president and chief legal officer, decried ''a hostile, organized campaign against Android by Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and other companies, waged through bogus patents.''
Less than two weeks later, though, Google announced a plan to acquire the cellphone maker Motorola Mobility Holdings for $12.5 billion, a move that was viewed partly as an effort to bolster Google's weak patent portfolio in the mobile business. That deal is still pending.
While the subject of Android was clearly an emotional issue for Mr. Jobs, there's no evidence yet that his death in October has altered Apple's willingness to reach a compromise with makers of Android products.

HEADLINE: Indexes Fall On Skidding Bank Shares

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and BINYAMIN APPELBAUM; Christine Hauser contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Talk about a bad anniversary present.
Two years after Brian T. Moynihan became Bank of America's chief executive, the beleaguered bank's shares crashed through the psychologically important $5 mark on Monday, the lowest they've traded since March 2009. Other bank stocks including Morgan Stanley fell even harder on Monday as investors fretted on renewed concerns about bank capital cushions and a darkening economic outlook in Europe.
When Mr. Moynihan was appointed to the top job on Dec. 16, 2009, Bank of America was trading near $15 a share, a far cry from the $4.99 at which it closed Monday. The loss of two-thirds of its value far exceeds the drop in other battered financial institutions like Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo over the same period. 
''This is like a fire in a 10-story building,'' said Mark T. Williams, a former Federal Reserve bank examiner who now teaches courses on banking at Boston University. ''It's burning through each floor as investors dump their shares.''
Financial stocks fell by more than 2 percent Monday in the United States, leading the entire stock market down. The Dow Jones industrial average closed off 100.13 points, or 0.8 percent, at 11,766.26. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 1.2 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 1.3 percent. The Dow is now down more than 2 percent this month, while the S.& P. is down more than 3 percent.
Trading on Wall Street had opened higher, but then turned negative in the late morning. Analysts said that market moves were expected to be exaggerated, with lighter volumes in a holiday week.
During the day, some focus shifted to European sovereign debt troubles as the European Central Bankwarned of a perilous year ahead. The sovereign debt crisis is colliding with slower economic growth and a dearth of market financing for banks.
A report in The Wall Street Journal that the Federal Reserve would rebuff pressure from American banks and go along with international recommendations on capital levels for banks also affected the markets, analysts said.
Citigroup fell 4.7 percent and Morgan Stanley 5.5 percent.
For Bank of America, which tumbled 4.1 percent, trading below $5 represents one more embarrassment this year. The company, based in Charlotte, N.C., recently lost its title as the country's largest bank by assets to JPMorgan Chase. More than anything else, Bank of America's problems stem from its disastrous 2008 acquisition of Countrywide Financial, the subprime mortgage giant whose excesses have come to symbolize the housing bubble of the last decade. It now faces lawsuits from investors seeking to force it to buy back billions in soured mortgages.
In addition, slow economic growth and ultra-low interest rates are eating into profit margins in traditional businesses like commercial lending. What's more, capital markets where banks help companies raise money and make deals have slowed in recent weeks, hurting results at Bank of America's investment banking unit.
Even a $5 billion investment by Warren E. Buffett this summer has failed to mollify sellers -- he has lost roughly $1.5 billion on paper, although the generous terms of his purchase agreement protect him against losses.
Along with more fundamental factors, institutional money managers are also quietly dumping their losers before 2012 arrives, a practice known as ''window dressing,'' which removes stocks like Bank of America when investors read year-end reports.
''It's a headache that a lot of money managers don't want,'' said one mutual fund manager who insisted on anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly. ''Managers don't want endowments and other clients asking them why they own Bank of America.''
Some observers have speculated that going below $5 would force some institutional investors to unload Bank of America stock because of rules forbidding them to own shares in the low single digits. But Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura, played down the likelihood of that.
''I don't think there are a lot of funds that need to sell below $5, although it's a nice round number that people can point to and say 'uh-oh,' '' he noted. ''I guess there is some concern that if anyone was heroic enough to step in and buy, this is another reason not to.''
Besides Europe's financial problems and the overhang from hundreds of billions in bad mortgage debt, banks also face worries about new rules requiring them to set aside more capital that could lower future profits. ''For financials, the higher capital requirements mean they have less money to make money with,'' said Brad Sorensen, an analyst for the Schwab Center for Financial Research. ''In an already tough environment, it gets a little bit more difficult.'' The Federal Reserve plans to publish this week a draft of new rules for systemically important financial companies, including banks with at least $50 billion in assets, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
The regulations include details of tougher capital requirements constraining the ability of those institutions to fund their operations with borrowed money. The United States won an international agreement to impose such requirements earlier this year, overcoming the initial opposition of European nations. Leaders of the Group of 20 nations endorsed the agreement at a November meeting.
The rules will require companies at the heart of the global financial system to raise a larger share of their funding by selling shares or holding on to profits, rather than borrowing money. For the most important firms, like JPMorgan Chase, the threshold will be 2.5 percentage points higher than the baseline requirement of 7 percent. The supplemental threshold will be lower for firms with less central roles.
The draft that the Fed plans to release this week will describe the new rules, but not which requirements will apply to specific financial firms.
Daniel K. Tarullo, appointed to the Fed's board of governors after the financial crisis to oversee its regulatory responsibilities, has long advocated for higher capital standards as necessary to increase the resilience of the financial system. The Fed initially hoped to publish a draft of the rules this summer, but was delayed by the complexity of incorporating various requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
In Europe, stocks had a choppy day on most major European exchanges, falling early, then rebounding in midsession before ending mixed.
The dollar gained against other major currencies. The euro fell to $1.2994 from $1.3034 late Friday.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 12/32, to 101 23/32. The yield fell to 1.81 percent, from 1.85 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Banking Worries Send Stocks Lower in U.S.

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; David Jolly and Jack Ewing contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Financial stocks fell by more than 2 percent in the United States on Monday and shares were mixed in Europe after remarks by European Central Bank officials and the prospect of increasing capital requirements suggested further challenges ahead for banks.
Asian indexes were lower after the news of the death of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, raised concerns about regional stability. 
Trading on Wall Street had opened higher but then turned negative in late morning. Analysts said that market moves were expected to be exaggerated, with lighter volumes in a holiday week.
During the day, some focus shifted to European sovereign debt troubles as the president of the E.C.B., Mario Draghi, forecast a difficult year for banks. Comments by Mr. Draghi in The Financial Times that dimmed the prospect of large-scale government bond purchases by the central bank -- as well as a report in The Wall Street Journal that the Federal Reserve would rebuff pressure from American banks and go along with international recommendations on capital levels for banks -- also affected the markets, analysts said.
''That kind of set a little bit of a negative tone,'' said Brad Sorensen, an analyst for the Schwab Center for Financial Research. ''For financials, the higher capital requirements mean they have less money to make money with. In an already tough environment, it gets a little bit more difficult.''
He added, ''Any time there is some uncertainty there, that kind of frightens the market a little bit.''
The Dow Jones industrial average closed off 100.13 points, or 0.8 percent, at 11,766.26. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 1.2 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 1.3 percent.
Bank of America dropped to $4.99, a decline of more than 4 percent. Morgan Stanley was down 5.5 percent, to $14.16.
While Mr. Draghi warned of a difficult year for banks, credit crunches are already visible in some countries like Ireland, Vitor Constancio, the vice president of the E.C.B., told reporters in Europe on Monday. Meanwhile, slower economic growth is likely to lead to an increase in bad loans, which will further weaken lenders.
Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, said it was difficult to tie the day's market movements to what was going on in Europe but said there was ''overarching concern in my view'' considering that there had been strong demand for the E.C.B. funding program, suggesting that banks margins could be pinched.
''Just in terms of the market performance today it is a little similar to Friday, when you have a pop at the open and then lost ground,'' Mr. Hembre said. ''There is somewhat of a European influence in that. It is not like there is any real dominant news story.''
Stocks had a choppy day on most major European exchanges, falling early, then rebounding in midsession before ending mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed slightly higher, or about a quarter of a point. The index in Paris, the CAC 40, was up less than 0.1 percent, while the German DAX was down 0.5 percent. The FTSE 100 index in London was down 0.4 percent.
United States bonds were down 4 basis points to 1.81 percent in yield. German government bonds, which along with the United States Treasuries are considered to be among the most secure investments in the world, were little changed, suggesting investors were calm after the shock of the Korean news wore off. They closed up 3 basis points to 1.875.
The dollar gained against other major currencies. The euro fell to $1.3017 from $1.3046 late Friday in New York.
In Asia, the Tokyo benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell 1.3 percent. The Sydney market index S.&P./ASX 200 fell 2.4 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell 1.2 percent and in Shanghai the composite index fell 0.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Twitter Use By Militants In Somalia Incites U.S.

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

 BODY:
NAIROBI, Kenya -- The United States government is increasingly concerned about the Twitter account of the Shabab militant group of Somalia, with American officials saying Monday that they were ''looking closely'' at the militants' use of Twitter and the possible measures to take in response. 
American officials would not disclose what action they were considering. But some American officials said the government was exploring legal options to shut down the Shabab's new Twitter account, potentially opening a debate over the line between free speech and support for terrorism.
Over the past two weeks, the Shabab, brutal Islamists known for chopping off hands and starving the famine-stricken populace, have been firing off pithy Twitter messages referring to their attacks and taunting the Kenyan military, which sent troops into Somalia in October to battle the Shabab.
''Your inexperienced boys flee from confrontation & flinch in the face of death,'' said a Shabab post addressed to the Kenyan Army.
Most of the Shabab's Twitter messages are in English, not Somali, and are clearly meant for an outside audience. American officials said they were worried that the Shabab might be using Twitter to reach potential recruits in the West.
Officials across the American government, from the State Department to local law enforcement, have said one of the top terrorism threats to the United States is the potential for American militants to travel to Somalia to fight with the Shabab and then return home to wreak havoc.
Already, several Americans have killed themselves as suicide bombers in Somalia working for the Shabab, who have claimed hundreds of victims with such attacks. The group has been fighting Somalia's transitional federal government, which is the internationally recognized authority and a recipient of millions of dollars from the United States government.
American officials say they may have the legal authority to demand that Twitter close the Shabab's account, @HSMPress, which had more than 4,600 followers as of Monday night.
Twitter, based in San Francisco, has about 100 million users. A company spokesman, Matt Graves, said on Monday, ''I appreciate your offer for Twitter to provide perspective for the story, but we are declining comment on this one.''
The Shabab have pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda, and in 2008 the State Department listed the group as a ''specially designated global terrorist'' and said it posed a significant risk of committing ''acts of terrorism that threaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.''
A State Department spokesman said, ''We are looking closely at the facts of this situation to determine what the appropriate next steps might be.''
The Shabab have imposed a draconian version of Islam in the areas of southern Somalia that they control, yanking out gold teeth, beheading shopkeepers, sawing off arms and stoning adulterers. Yet, at the same time, they have shown technological savvy, showcasing their work through slick propaganda videos, Web sites and electronic chat rooms.
The State Department said federal law enforcement agencies had taken action in the past against individuals using ''Web hosting and related services.''

HEADLINE: An Inconvenient Truth

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
There is so much about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that we should be angry about.
In their heyday, these strange hybrids -- part corporation, part government agency -- were the biggest bullies in Washington, quick to bludgeon critics who dared suggest that their dual missions of maximizing profits while making homeownership affordable for low- and moderate-income Americans were incompatible. They steamrolled their regulator and pushed back at any suggestion that their capital was inadequate.
For years, they essentially wrote most of the legislation that affected them, which they larded with loopholes. In the mid-2000s, they had giant accounting scandals. Eventually, their quest for profits led them to make a belated, disastrous foray into subprime mortgages, which ended with their collapse, and which has cost taxpayers about $150 billion. Tragically, Fannie and Freddie could have led a housing recovery -- if they hadn't become crippled wards of the state instead. 
Yet these real sins have been largely overlooked in favor of imagined ones. Over at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, two resident scholars, Peter Wallison and Edward Pinto, have concocted what has since become a Republican meme: namely, that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were ground zero for the entire crisis, leading the private sector off the cliff with their affordable housing mandates and massive subprime holdings.
The truth is the opposite: Fannie and Freddie got into subprime mortgages, with great trepidation, only in 2005 and 2006, and only because they were losing so much market share to Wall Street. Among other things, the Wallison-Pinto case relies on inflated data -- Pinto classifies just about anything that is not a 30-year-fixed mortgage as ''subprime.'' The reality is that Fannie and Freddie followed the private sector off the cliff instead of the other way around.
Nevertheless, Wallison, who was a member of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission -- charged with investigating the root causes of the crisis -- wrote a 99-page dissent when the F.C.I.C. issued its final report, claiming it was all Fannie and Freddie's fault. In a column I wrote at the time, I described Wallison's dissent as a ''lonely, loony cri de coeur.'' He's been trying to get me to take it back ever since.
On Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission waded into the Fannie/Freddie wars by filing a lawsuit against three executives from each company. The complaint charges them with making ''materially false'' disclosures about the size of the companies' subprime portfolios.
In unveiling the lawsuit, Robert Khuzami, the agency's enforcement chief, said that the S.E.C.'s action showed that ''all individuals, regardless of their rank or position, will be held accountable.'' Not really. What it shows is how desperate the S.E.C. has become to bring a crowd-pleasing case.
The complaint is extraordinarily weak. Taking its cues from the Wallison/Pinto school of inflated data, it claims that Fannie and Freddie failed to reveal to investors the true extent of their subprime portfolios. To make this claim, however, the S.E.C. has included categories of loans, such as so-called Alt-A loans, that may have had a subprime characteristic, such as low documentation, but which were often made to borrowers with high credit scores.
There are no damning internal e-mails in the complaint, with executives contradicting their public statements, and no examples of sleazy insider stock sales. A quick look at Fannie and Freddie financial disclosure statements shows that they clearly laid out the credit characteristics of their mortgage portfolios, even if they didn't label every non-30-year-fixed loan as subprime. More than a year ago, a federal judge presiding over a shareholder lawsuit against Fannie Mae threw out the allegations surrounding lack of disclosure. Why? Because, he said, the company's disclosure of its subprime portfolio had been adequate.
There is something else missing from the S.E.C. complaint, which Wallison and Pinto also conveniently ignore: default data. The truth is, for all their mistakes, Fannie and Freddie had some scruples about the nonprime loans they did make -- and they have the default numbers to prove it.
For instance, according to David Min, a leading Wallison critic at the Center for American Progress, as of the second quarter of 2010, the delinquency rate on all Fannie and Freddie guaranteed loans was 5.9 percent. By contrast, the national average was 9.11 percent. The Fannie and Freddie Alt-A default rate is similarly much lower than the national default rate. The only possible explanation for this is that many of the loans being characterized by the S.E.C. and Wallison/Pinto as ''subprime'' are not, in fact, true subprime mortgages.
After the S.E.C. filed its charges on Friday, I received an e-mail from Wallison, suggesting that the complaint proved that he had been right and that I had wronged him. I now concede that he is half-right. Loony though his theory may be, he's sure not lonely anymore.

HEADLINE: Pecan Thieves in Georgia Enjoying A Windfall, at $1.50 a Pound

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
FORT VALLEY, Ga. -- To an enterprising thief, or even a casual dabbler in crime, the fallen pecans that cover thousands of acres of unpatrolled Georgia nut orchards might as well be a carpet of nickels.
Scoop up a pound -- 30 nuts or so -- and it can be cashed in for as much as $1.50 at the local buying station. A more organized criminal might cut a hole in a fence at a nut-cleaning plant and drive away with a couple of thousand dollars' worth of top-quality pecans.
Nut theft has long been a reality here in the nation's pecan belt. It has become such a way of life that a south Georgia rapper, Hawkdogg, even has a song about it: ''Crank Dat Pecan.'' But this season, which began in October and ends in January, the thefts appear to be at record levels, growers and the police say. 
''We've had people go in there stealing pecans just like they're going to a hardware store and taking a hammer and nails,'' said Duke Lane, owner of Lane's Southern Orchards and president of the Georgia Pecan Growers Association.
At least 50 people have been caught on his 2,600-acre orchard this year, Mr. Lane said.
''If somebody's hungry and they want a handful of nuts, that's one thing,'' he said. ''But this is different. These guys have whole sacks.''
To protect themselves, growers have installed security cameras. But since most thefts happen at night, it's hard to identify the culprits. The growers have hired security guards and added fences topped with barbed wire. But the orchards are too large to patrol effectively, and thieves cut through the chain link almost as soon as it goes up.
Still, pecan thieves are being caught in numbers that are nearly double what they were in 2010.
In Peach County, about a two-hour drive south from Atlanta, more than 30 arrests have been made this season, said Capt. Kenny M. Cameron of the sheriff's office. One person was caught stealing 1,400 pounds of the nuts.
Farther south, in Mitchell County, there have been 37 reports of pecan thefts in the last two months, resulting in 16 arrests. Four were for felonies, said Joseph K. Mulholland, the district attorney for a five-county region that includes some of Georgia's top pecan orchards.
The price of pecans is high this season, making them particularly lucrative for growers and thieves alike.
''Right now, you're basically picking money off the ground,'' Mr. Mulholland said.
Extreme drought and heat have hurt pecan production for Georgia's biggest competitor, Texas, where the crop could be down by as much as 40 percent, according to agricultural extension reports.
Meanwhile, demand for pecans in China and other countries has been growing. Sixty-five percent of the crop from Georgia's biggest pecan grower goes overseas. Premium growers can get a healthy $3 a pound these days.
That means prices are up in the casual ''yard nut'' market, too. In rural Georgia, selling pecans that have fallen from the trees in one's yard is a country version of returning cans and bottles for instant cash.
Nut processors have drive-up buying stations in several farming communities, and it is nearly impossible to tell a bag of legitimate yard nuts from a stolen one. Thieves also set up roadside stands or sell to people who act as middlemen, gathering small amounts until they have enough to head to the broker.
''Somebody's going to buy that nut no questions asked,'' said Charles Evans, the state's largest pecan grower, who goes by the nickname Chop. Mr. Evans's crews will process more than seven million pounds of nuts this season. He is not sure how much he will lose to theft, but estimates it will be tens of thousands of pounds.
Certainly, thieves in Georgia steal all kinds of fruits and vegetables, but pecans are a particularly easy target. Growers use machines to shake pecans off trees, and usually leave them on the ground for a few days before they are mechanically scooped up. And plenty fall from the trees on their own..
And unlike a delicate, fast-ripening peach, a pecan can be stored until a buyer is found. ''With a peach, it's like you're holding a melting ice cube and trying to unload it,'' Mr. Evans said.
A troubled economy is also contributing to the high rate of pecan theft, said Deputy Tim Hardy of the Peach County sheriff's office. ''People are trying to make a few extra bucks for the holidays or to make ends meet,'' he said. As a result, law enforcement officials are making more vigorous use of a Georgia law that makes it a felony to steal more than $500 worth of agricultural products.
As a scare tactic, officers are increasingly charging pecan thieves with burglary instead of trespassing, Mr. Mulholland, the district attorney, said.
In Peach County Magistrate Court last week, four pecan cases were on the docket. They all involved criminal trespassing charges, which means the defendants had been caught with small amounts.
One person did not appear, and the other three were let off with warnings. They had been picking nuts up along the side of the road and outside fenced orchards with no signs warning them off.
Two of the defendants, Jeanette Ogle and Randall Sorrow Jr., both in their 20s and engaged to be married, said they had been collecting nuts so Ms. Ogle's mother could make holiday pies. When the farmer caught them, the couple offered to give back their bucket of pecans. Instead, he called the sheriff.
They learned their lesson: it is a rare pecan in this part of the country that does not belong to someone else.
And they have definitely changed their dessert plans for the holiday. ''I think we're going to go for a pumpkin pie,'' Ms. Ogle said. ''I don't want to see another pecan right now.''

HEADLINE: Helping a Son Cope With Diabetes, While Juggling Her Own Challenges

BYLINE: By MATHEW R. WARREN

 BODY:
Playtime and parties can be dangerous pastimes for Joshua Cancino-Betanzos.
Joshua, 9, has an insulin pump in his abdomen, and he has to be extra careful because any jostling in the schoolyard could easily stop it from working properly.
He is also not free to enjoy sweets as other children can. Recently, he dreaded a school party where treats were to be served; his mother offered to make him his own cake so he would not feel left out. 
Joshua is still learning to cope with his illness, Type 1 diabetes, but he is an expert on recognizing the symptoms of a diabetic episode.
''I can tell that something is wrong when I get really, really thirsty and have blurry vision,'' he said.
When Joshua was 6, no one knew the true nature of his illness, not even doctors in Mexico, where he lived with his family. They misdiagnosed his condition for months, his mother, Virna Cancino, said. It was only after he fell into a coma and needed emergency treatment that the physicians got the diagnosis right, she said.
In 2008, Ms. Cancino left Mexico and headed to New York with her two youngest sons, Joshua and Sebastian Cancino-Betanzos, who was 8 at the time. The plan was to reunite with the boys' father, who was already in the city.
Ms. Cancino, who had worked as a hotel receptionist, hoped to find a decent job to help support her family. She also oversees Joshua's medical needs: he has to have regular insulin injections, a carefully regulated diet and a check of his glucose levels three times a day.
''I didn't realize it was going to be so hard having a child with this kind of problem,'' Ms. Cancino, 42, said. ''It requires a lot of attention.''
Once in New York, Joshua began seeing a pediatrician regularly and was fitted with the insulin pump. His treatment is paid for through Child Health Plus, a state insurance plan for low-income families.
Ms. Cancino found work as a housekeeper, and the boys began attending school in Queens. But throughout the year, the school nurse, who checked Joshua's glucose after lunch, would frequently summon Ms. Cancino because of his condition. To keep the school from sending him to the emergency room, Ms. Cancino would leave work to pick him up and attend to the problem; it usually involved adjusting his insulin dosage.
Because of Joshua's need for constant care and a worsening circulation condition of her own, Ms. Cancino was unable to keep her job, she said. She has chronic venous insufficiency, in which the leg veins struggle to return blood to the heart, causing terrible pain.
At the same time, life with her children's father, a restaurant cook, was becoming increasingly volatile. He physically abused her, she said, and was eventually arrested. He is now in proceedings to be deported to Mexico, she said.
But Ms. Cancino says she has forgiven him. She fears that his deportation may mean losing the $1,400 a month he pays in child support. It is her only source of income, covering all the family's expenses, including $600 a month in rent for her and her children to share a two-bedroom apartment with a roommate in Richmond Hill, Queens.
''To me he wasn't good at all, but he is a good father,'' she said. ''We still depend on him a lot.''
With the help of Sanctuary for Families, an organization that works with victims of domestic violence, Ms. Cancino was granted a U visa, given to immigrants who are victims of certain crimes.
Ms. Cancino was emboldened to try to re-enter the work force, but felt unprepared. She decided to attend career-readiness workshops in Lower Manhattan at Sanctuary for Families, an affiliate of the Community Service Society of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. But the trip from her home was more than she could afford. The agency drew $416 from the fund to cover the cost of four monthly MetroCards so that she could travel to the workshops.
Ms. Cancino has improved her typing skills, taken a class on data entry and brushed up on resume-writing and preparing for job interviews. She hopes that despite a tough economy, her new skills will help her find an office job.
Joshua says he feels lucky for all the sacrifices his mother has made. He hopes to become a veterinarian.
His mother, though, believes she would make a good nurse, a job for which she says she has been well trained.
''I learned from Joshua,'' she said. ''I've been practically his personal nurse.''

HEADLINE: House Republicans Refuse to Budge on Extension of Payroll Tax Cut

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Under fire from senators in their own party, House Republicans on Monday prepared to reject a Senate measure to extend a payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits for millions of Americans for two months, and demanded that the Senate reopen negotiations over the benefits.
Democrats, however, imagining the political wind at their backs, said they would not return to the Capitol to negotiate further until the House passed the short-term bill, one that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, negotiated and voted for, along with 38 other Republican senators on Saturday.
The House had been planning to vote on the two-month payroll tax bill on Monday night. But after a two-hour meeting of their caucus, House Republican leaders postponed the floor debate and the vote to Tuesday.
''The votes will take place tomorrow in the light of day,'' said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 3 House Republican. 
However, rather than have a straight up-or-down vote, the House will implement a procedural maneuver in which they will ''reject'' the Senate bill while requesting to go to conference with members of that chamber in a single measure, protecting House members from having to actually vote against extending a payroll tax cut. During the conference meeting among Republican members, some members expressed concern about effectively voting for a tax increase on the eve of an election year, said some who attended.
Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, said he was confident that he had the votes to reject the Senate version of the bill.
The standoff leaves Mr. Boehner ending the year exactly where he began, in the middle of a nasty fiscal fight with Senate Democrats and his conservative freshmen in revolt, making it difficult to find a middle ground between mollifying his conference and coming up with legislation to avert disaster. But Mr. Boehner said repeatedly on Monday that he believed a deal for a one-year extension could still be struck, even with the Senate essentially adjourned for the year and the tax break set to expire on Jan. 1.
''I don't believe the differences are that significant that we can't do this for a whole year,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''Why punt this until the end of February when we can just do this now and get it over with?''
Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader, urged Mr. Boehner to allow an up-or-down vote. ''With millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet, it would be unconscionable for Speaker Boehner to block a bipartisan agreement that would protect middle-class families from the thousand-dollar tax increase looming on January first,'' Mr. Reid said in a statement.
A core group of conservative House members, many of them newcomers who provided the Republican majority, have balked all year at short-term spending agreements, including proposed legislation to raise the debt ceiling and bills to increase disaster funding. It remained far from clear Monday night how, or whether, the tax cuts would be extended for 160 million workers and millions of unemployed Americans would continue to get jobless benefits next year.
''We are witnessing the concluding convulsion of confrontation and obstruction in the most unproductive, Tea Party-dominated partisan session of the Congress -- the most partisan of which I have participated,'' Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, said during a news briefing on Monday. He has served in Congress for three decades.
The impasse began over the weekend when House Republicans said they would reject the Senate measure, which passed 89 to 10. It would, for two months, extend the payroll tax cut, continue unemployment benefits and prevent a cut in fees paid to doctors who accept Medicare, and would allow lawmakers and the White House time to work out their differences on how to pay for a yearlong extension.
Many rank-and-file Republicans have questioned continuing the payroll tax break, because it would reduce the flow of revenue to the Social Security trust fund, which would be replaced by payments from the Treasury. But House Republican leaders said on Monday that their objection was not to the tax cut itself, but to the temporary nature of the fix.
''We don't need to be governing in two-month increments,'' Representative Eric Cantor, the Virginia Republican and majority leader, said on CNN. Mr. Boehner, who said on Monday that he never assured the Senate that such a package would pass his chamber, did insist on and win a sweetener provision, one that would speed the review process for construction of an oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast.
On Monday, with House Republicans moving ahead with their plans to block the bill, some of their counterparts in the Senate issued strong rebukes.
''The House Republicans' plan to scuttle the deal to help middle-class families is irresponsible and wrong,'' said Senator Scott P. Brown, Republican of Massachusetts. He was echoed by other Republican senators, including Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and Dean Heller of Nevada; all three of them face re-election in 2012.
But Republican freshmen in the House, several of whom held a news conference on Monday to describe their position, said they were not particularly moved by the Republican senators or pressure from Democrats.
The Senate's decision to go with a two-month bill showed ''a failure of leadership in the entire Senate -- it's Democrat and Republican,'' said Representative Tom Reed, a freshman Republican from upstate New York. ''If that's what the Senate believes is leadership, then I believe the Senate is a complete failure.''
Democrats, on defense most of the year against the will of the House, found themselves in an unusual position on Monday, content to sit back as Republicans fought among themselves. Senate Democrats did send out videos on Twitter of Mr. McConnell giving a high five to a colleague after the bill's passage, meant to be the final act of the first session of the 112th Congress.
As lawmakers fought, payroll specialists told Congress on Monday that the two-month change in Social Security payroll tax rates envisioned in the Senate bill was not workable.
In a letter to Congressional leaders, Pete A. Isberg, president of the National Payroll Reporting Consortium, a trade group, said there was not enough notice to accommodate the proposal.
Many payroll administrators will have difficulty adjusting computer systems before January or even February, Mr. Isberg said. ''Taxpayers who are paid more than $18,350 in the first two months of the year could be confused or upset by application of the higher tax rate,'' he said. If employers do not change their payroll systems in time, he said, they may try to ''collect additional taxes late in the year'' for those months.
Online Correction: December 19, 2011, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A previous version of this article misstated the vote in the Senate on Saturday on a bill to extend a payroll tax cut and jobless benefits for two months; the bill passed 89 to 10, not 89 to 19.

HEADLINE: AT&T, in Major Setback, Drops Its Bid for T-Mobile

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
AT&T on Monday ended its effort to buy T-Mobile USA, acknowledging that it could not overcome stiff opposition by the Obama administration to form the nation's biggest cellphone service provider.
The decision to scrap the $39 billion takeover - which would have been the biggest deal of the year - is a major setback for AT&T, which had pinned its hopes for growth on the acquisition. The company wanted T-Mobile's cellular airwaves, or spectrum, to relieve its congested network and offer faster service for data-hungry devices like the iPhone.
And the deal's end leaves T-Mobile, the weakest of the four national operators, with an uncertain future. 
For the Obama administration, the collapse of the deal is confirmation that it has reinvigorated antitrust oversight that it said had become weak under its predecessor. The Justice Department took the aggressive step of suing to block the deal in late August, while the Federal Communications Commission had signaled its intent to fight the merger as well.
''People in this town didn't think that the department was willing to take the risk to litigate big, complex cases,'' said a senior Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because employees were not authorized to go beyond the department's public statement. ''But this puts down a very firm marker that we are taking antitrust enforcement very seriously.''
The company had sought to offer concessions to win regulatory approval, including potentially selling more than a quarter of T-Mobile's customers and spectrum to a competitor like Leap Wireless.
Other ideas included possible network-sharing agreements, though those were less fully developed.
After the F.C.C. declared its opposition to the deal, AT&T withdrew its application for approval from the agency on Thanksgiving. Last week, AT&T asked for a delay in the Justice Department lawsuit as it weighed its options.
By this last weekend, AT&T had concluded that no change to its bid would have been enough to pass muster, according to people briefed on the matter.
A merger of the two companies, consumer advocates had said, would have created a duopoly of AT&T and Verizon Wireless with almost three-quarters of the market between them.
''Consumers won today,'' Sharis A. Pozen, the Justice Department's acting assistant attorney general for antitrust, said in a statement. ''Had AT&T acquired T-Mobile, consumers in the wireless marketplace would have faced higher prices and reduced innovation.''
AT&T will pay Deutsche Telekom $4 billion in cash and wireless spectrum access as a break-up fee under the terms of the merger announced in March. After taxes, however, the financial hit to AT&T will be only about $1.5 billion, or roughly two months' worth of cash flow. The two companies will now begin a seven-year roaming agreement that will expand T-Mobile's national coverage.
That agreement, however, does not solve AT&T's network constraints. Nor does it shore up T-Mobile's diminishing competitive position. Deutsche Telekom has indicated that it would like to dispose of T-Mobile eventually, having failed to develop it into a stronger competitor to AT&T, Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel.
The push for a merger was spearheaded by Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T's chairman and chief executive, in his first bold strategic step since taking the reins in 2007.
To support the deal, AT&T lined up an assortment of lawmakers, corporate customers and local partners to promote the benefits of the merger.
But that campaign held little sway over government regulators, who were skeptical of arguments that uniting two of the nation's biggest wireless companies would not harm competition. The Justice Department joined with several state attorneys general in its antitrust lawsuit and hired prominent outside counsel. And the F.C.C. published its staff's 157-page internal report laying out its concerns about the deal.
AT&T had prepared for battle with the government, adopting at times an openly hostile stance toward the F.C.C. And few people thought the Justice Department would be able to fend off AT&T, whose Washington lobbying operation is legendary.
Still, the companies said from the beginning that they were willing to consider conditions that might be required to allow the deal to proceed. And the Justice Department had taken criticism for approving other big deals, including Comcast's takeover of NBCUniversal.
In the case of AT&T, Justice Department officials repeatedly signaled that they would oppose the deal, and finally sued the company in late summer.
On Monday, AT&T said it would continue to invest in expanding its network. But Mr. Stephenson warned lawmakers that they must take action to increase the availability of wireless spectrum to help expand faster cellular data coverage.
''The mobile Internet is a dynamic industry that can be a critical driver in restoring American economic growth and job creation, but only if companies are allowed to react quickly to customer needs and market forces,'' he said.
Analysts said that Deutsche Telekom must weigh the future of T-Mobile, including a potential sale of assets or an initial public offering.
One potential partner is Dish Network, the satellite TV provider. Its chief executive, Joseph Clayton , told Bloomberg News last week that his company was willing to pool its wireless holdings with T-Mobile's to create a stronger competitor to AT&T and Verizon.
''T-Mobile is probably going to be profoundly damaged by this,'' Tero Kuittinen, an independent research analyst, said. ''They should have done some strategic rethinking instead of chasing this mirage, this dream of a merger. Now they've lost a lot of time.''

HEADLINE: China Exerts Influence Nurtured Over Decades

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Michael Wines contributed reporting, and Li Bibo and Mia Lia contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China, North Korea's foremost ally, appears to be moving quickly to try to ensure stability in a crippled and isolated nation now facing a leadership transition fraught with dangers.
According to former government officials and analysts, both Chinese and foreign, China's leaders had been hoping that Kim Jong-il, who died on Saturday, would live for at least two or three more years to solidify the succession process that he had begun with his youngest son, Kim Jong-un. Uncertainty now looms, not only over whether the younger Kim can consolidate his power in the face of competing elite factions, but also over whether the elder Kim's economic initiatives will continue, which had included several visits to China to study it as a model for possible economic reforms.
So, the analysts and former officials say, the Chinese are seeking to deepen their influence over senior North Korean officials, particularly in the military, and to use the channels they have kept open with North Korea even as the West, frustrated over its nuclear intransigence, closed doors. China's highest priority is one shared far more broadly: guarding against a rise in tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula. That is a distinct possibility if North Korean generals try to reinforce their hold on power through aggression toward South Korea. 
''At this moment, China might provide the best chance of stability,'' said Robert Carlin, a former State Department official and fellow at Stanford University who travels to North Korea.
''They want to be the best informed and have a modicum of influence and have people consulting with them at this moment,'' Mr. Carlin said. ''The rest of us are deaf, dumb, blind and with our arms tied behind our backs.''
John Delury, a scholar of China and the two Koreas at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea, said: ''Chinese diplomats are the only ones who can pick up the phone and talk to North Korean counterparts about what is going on, what to expect. This reveals the fatal weakness in Washington and Seoul's over-reliance on sanctions over the past three years.''
The worries among some Chinese were evident. ''The death significantly enhances uncertainty on the peninsula,'' said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. ''In my personal view, the succession is very hastily arranged, and Kim Jong-un is very ill prepared to take over.''
China values North Korea as a buffer state that keeps American troops in South Korea at a distance, but relations between the two communist countries have endured complicated twists in recent years. Chinese officials were upset by North Korea's sudden shelling of Yeonpyeong Island in South Korea last year, and have lobbied North Korea to refrain from further military actions, analysts say. Earlier in 2010, China was put in an awkward position when South Korea and the United States accused North Korea of sinking the Cheonan, a South Korean warship, with a torpedo. The United States pressured China to agree with its allegation, which China refused to do. North Korea denied any involvement.
Those episodes, while increasing strains, have also made North Korea more dependent on China. China and South Korea recently accounted for 55 percent to 80 percent of North Korea's trade, according to a paper published this year by two scholars of North Korea at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics, Stephan Haggard and Marcus Noland. After the Cheonan sinking, most of North Korea's trade with South Korea stopped, making China an even bigger partner.
Exact trade figures are difficult to pinpoint. A paper published in December 2010 by the Congressional Research Service estimated that in 2009, exports from North Korea to China increased to $793 million, while Chinese exports to the North slowed slightly to $1.9 billion. Chinese trade and investment undercut the economic sanctions that the United States and other nations imposed on North Korea to try to halt its nuclear program.
The trade can take many forms. Susan Shirk, a former State Department official and professor of political science at the University of California at San Diego, said she had spoken with a North Korean man in Pyongyang in September who was conducting state-to-state trade with China. She said the man worked for the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and he was selling iron ore to China at the price that China pays to large trade partners like Australia; in return, he was buying corn from China at the price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange that day.
North Korean leaders are also trying to jump-start the languishing trade zone of Rason on the Chinese border and to get Chinese businesses to invest in tourism infrastructure, including a creaking cruise ship running between Rason and the Mount Kumgang nature park.
''China and North Korea are locked in this dance of interdependency,'' said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, an analyst based in Beijing for the International Crisis Group. ''China is going to have to continue to be a big benefactor and bankroll North Korea to a big extent.''
On Monday, as anxieties over North Korea's path bubbled to the surface in Beijing, so did signs of mourning. People brought bouquets of white flowers to the North Korean Embassy in Beijing and were allowed inside. Police officers surrounding the building kept all others at a distance. Asked about visas, a guard said, ''Come back next year.'' The flag atop the embassy roof was lowered to half-staff. One resident of Beijing with ties to North Korea said telephone operators in Pyongyang were crying when he got through to a call center there.
Evening newspapers in China ran front-page headlines. Xinhua, the state news agency, cited a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ma Zhaoxu, who called Mr. Kim a ''great leader'' and added, ''China and North Korea will strive together to continue making positive contributions.''
There were some irreverent takes. Netease, a popular Internet portal, ran a topics page with a headline saying, ''Kim Jong-il's Death Shows the Importance of Losing Weight.'' The subtitle was even more subversive: ''A government is just like a human body, in that neither can afford to be too fat.''

HEADLINE: Britain Plans to Make Banks Split Off Investment Business

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- The British government plans stricter banking regulations that would force banks to separate their investment banking operations from those businesses that take deposits.
The chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, said on Monday that the government would seek to pass laws by 2015 to strengthen financial regulation as proposed by an independent commission led by John Vickers, a former Bank of England chief economist. The new laws would then apply by 2019 the latest. 
''These are the most far-reaching reforms of British banking in modern history,'' Mr. Osborne said in a speech to Parliament. The overhaul is intended to allow Britain to stay ''home to one of the world's leading financial centers without exposing British taxpayers to the massive costs of those banks failing.''
The new rules represent a bigger change for the banking industry here than the Dodd-Frank overhaul has meant for banks in the United States, some analysts have argued. Under the British regulations, investment banking and retail banking operations would be different legal entities and financed separately. The rules would also require banks to set aside a slightly bigger capital cushion than required by the Basel III regulations. Only Switzerland has asked its banks to hold more capital to absorb future potential losses so far.
British banks would have to shield deposits of individuals and small and medium-size companies in their consumer bank from investment banking activities, like trading. This means banks would no longer be able to use deposits to finance investment banking units. Investment banking businesses would also be allowed to fail without affecting the rest of the bank. The new rules would not apply to subsidiaries of non-British banks in Britain.
''Business models need to be fundamentally overhauled,'' Jon Pain, head of financial services risk consulting in Britain at KPMG, said. Major banks should not be ''fooled'' by the timetable as they ''will need to make some serious decisions before June,'' he added.
Angela Knight, head of the British Bankers' Association, played down the impact of the changes, saying that the government's decision was just ''the next stage of a program of reform'' and that ''banks have already made significant changes to how they operate.''
Some banking executives have argued that the new rules will be expensive for the banks at a time when the industry is already struggling with sluggish growth and volatile markets. Some banks, including HSBC, have previously said they will consider moving their headquarters abroad if the new regulation is too punishing.
Mr. Osborne denied Monday that the rules would make London less attractive as a financial center.
He said the reforms were expected to cost the banking industry as much as 8 billion, or about $12 billion, because banks would no longer benefit from the perceived guarantee that the government would bail them out.
The government asked the Vickers commission last year to come up with proposals of how best to protect taxpayers from having to bail out financial institutions during any future banking crises. Britain's government spent more than $1 trillion bailing out ailing financial institutions during the recent financial crisis and still owns stakes in two of the country's largest banks, Royal Bank of Scotland and the Lloyds Banking Group.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Middle-Class Agenda

 BODY:
Earlier this month, President Obama delivered his first unabashed 2012 campaign speech. Unlike his opponents, Mr. Obama acknowledged the ravages of income equality, the hollowing out of the American middle class. There is no hyperbole in the urgency he conveyed about ''a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and for all those who are fighting to get into the middle class.''
The challenge for Mr. Obama is to translate the plight of the middle class into an agenda for broad prosperity. Congress's inability to cleanly extend even emergency measures though 2012 -- including the temporary payroll tax cut and federal unemployment benefits -- underscores the difficulty. The alternative is continued decline.
Recent government data show that 100 million Americans, or about one in three, are living in poverty or very close to it. Of 13.3 million unemployed Americans now searching for work, 5.7 million have been looking for more than six months, while millions more have given up altogether. Even a job is no guarantee of middle-class security. The real median income of working-age households has declined, from $61,600 in 2000 to $55,300 in 2010 -- the result of abysmally slow job growth even before the onset of the recession. 
Economic growth alone, even if it accelerated, would not be enough to restore the middle class. Mr. Obama refuted the Republican notion that market forces alone can ensure broad prosperity, when the economic health of American families also depends on government action.
It was a speech that called out for a plan. Here are the elements that matter most:
CREATING GOOD JOBS Despite Republican obstructionism, Mr. Obama must continue to offer stimulus bills that include spending for public works, high-tech manufacturing and an infrastructure bank. He must stress that obstruction costs jobs -- the bill recently filibustered by Republicans would have created an estimated 1.9 million jobs in 2012. The Republican stance also endangers future prosperity by denying needed infrastructure upgrades and making it likely that international competitors will outstrip America in jobs and technology.
In particular, Mr. Obama needs to debunk the notion that job creation is at odds with environmental protection. Republicans have portrayed opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline as a job killer. The truth is, oil addiction and the failure to invest in new energy sources will be far bigger job killers. What's needed is a plan to create millions of clean energy jobs and to link those jobs to workers in fossil fuel industries who otherwise would be displaced. The climate bill that died in 2010 would have begun that transformation; the need to try again only becomes more pressing with each passing year.
At the same time, Mr. Obama cannot ignore that most of the fast-growing occupations in America are lower-paying service jobs, like home health care and food service, in which it's all but impossible to make a living. To lift wages requires generous tax credits for low earners, a higher minimum wage, and guaranteed health care so that wages are not consumed by medical costs. Job training efforts must also focus on the service sector, helping to build so-called career ladders, say, from home health aid to licensed vocational nurse.
STOPPING FORECLOSURES In his Kansas speech, Mr. Obama said banks ''should be working to keep responsible homeowners in their homes.'' That's too weak. The banks have never made an all-out effort to help homeowners and unless compelled to do so, they never will, because, in many cases, they can make more by foreclosing rather than by modifying troubled loans.
Federal agencies can keep working with some state attorneys general and try to settle with banks over foreclosure abuses in exchange for a commitment from them to modify some $20 billion worth of troubled loans, or they can conduct a thorough federal investigation into the banks' conduct during the mortgage bubble, looking for a far bigger settlement. The market is beset with $700 billion of negative equity; potential bank abuses are unexplored; the public is demanding accountability. Mr. Obama should opt for a thorough federal inquiry.
In the meantime, an antiforeclosure plan that is up to the scale of the problem would include unrelenting political pressure for principal write-downs of underwater loans, expanded refinancings for borrowers in high-rate loans, and forbearance for unemployed homeowners.
REGULATING THE BANKS Mr. Obama said banks are fighting the Dodd-Frank reform ''every inch of the way.''
The question is what he will do to fight back. A good start would be for him to tell the American public whether the law is capable of performing as intended. Is he confident that a major bank on the verge of failure could be successfully dismantled? Is he sure that risky bank trading will be sufficiently curtailed? If he is not confident that the law can work as intended, he must ensure better implementation or call for a revamp of the statute itself.
He can also personally advance specific Dodd-Frank provisions. Republicans are intent on destroying the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; Mr. Obama should try to recess appoint his nominee to lead the bureau, Richard Cordray, whom Republicans recently filibustered. Mr. Obama must make clear that he supports a strong Dodd-Frank disclosure rule on the ratio of the pay of chief executives to that of rank-and-file employees. Such disclosure is crucial to changing the corporate norms that have allowed for unjustifiably vast pay discrepancies.
RAISING TAXES, REDUCING THE DEFICITTax reform is essential. But there is no way to build public consensus for broad reform without first reversing the lavish tax breaks for the rich. In addition to letting the high-end Bush-era tax cuts expire at the end of 2012, Mr. Obama could call for all forms of income to be taxed at the same rates, rather than allowing lower rates for investment income, which flows mostly to wealthy Americans. Income tax rates also need to be adjusted at the top of the scale, so that the affluent, say, couples with taxable income of $400,000 a year, are not paying the same top rate as multimillionaires.
Mr. Obama should also drop his opposition to a financial transactions tax. That stance may have made sense when the banks were reeling from the financial crisis, but it is now at odds with a stated desire to rein in the financial sector and raise needed revenue.
Mr. Obama has more than established his willingness to cut the deficit, agreeing to spending cuts that, in fact, are too deep for the weak economy. Now he needs to dominate the deficit debate, not by trying to meet Republican demands for ever more spending cuts, but by explaining that more cuts would undermine the recovery. In the near term, high-end tax increases are a better way to control the deficit. They are less of a drag on economic activity than broad tax increases or federal spending cuts.
More jobs. Fewer foreclosures. Less financial risk. Progressive taxation. Those policies will give the middle class a fighting chance. But the list is not exhaustive. The pillars of a healthy middle class also include public education, Social Security, unions, child care, affirmative action and, not least, campaign finance reform, since inequality is reinforced by the political power of the wealthy.

HEADLINE: China's Newest Province?

BYLINE: By VICTOR CHA. 
Victor Cha, a professor at Georgetown and author of the forthcoming book ''The Impossible State: North Korea, Past, and Future,'' was director of Asian affairs at the White House from 2004 to 2007.

 BODY:
Washington
NORTH KOREA as we know it is over. Whether it comes apart in the next few weeks or over several months, the regime will not be able to hold together after the untimely death of its leader, Kim Jong-il. How America responds -- and, perhaps even more important, how America responds to how China responds -- will determine whether the region moves toward greater stability or falls into conflict.
Mr. Kim's death could not have come at a worse time for North Korea. Economically broken, starving and politically isolated, this dark kingdom was in the midst of preparations to hand power over to his not-yet-30-year-old son, the untested Kim Jong-un. The ''great successor,'' as he has been dubbed by the state media, is surrounded by elders who are no less sick than his father and a military that chafed at his promotion to four-star general last year without having served a day in the army. Such a system simply cannot hold. 
The transition comes at a time when the United States has been trying to get nuclear negotiations back on track. Those efforts have now been replaced by a scramble for plans to control loose nuclear weapons, should the regime collapse.
And yet Washington remains powerless. Any outreach to the young Mr. Kim or to other possible competitors could create more problems during the transition, and would certainly be viewed as threatening by China. Since Kim Jong-il's stroke in 2008, the United States and South Korea have been working on contingency plans to deal with just such a situation, but they all thought they would have years, if not a decade.
The allies' best move, then, is to wait and see what China does. Among China's core foreign-policy principles is the maintenance of a divided Korean Peninsula, and so Beijing's statements about preserving continuity of North Korea's leadership should come as no surprise. Since 2008 it has drawn closer to the regime, publicly defending its leaders and investing heavily in the mineral mines on the Chinese-North Korean border.
But even as Beijing sticks close to its little Communist brother, there are intense debates within its leadership about whether the North is a strategic liability. It was one thing to back a hermetic but stable regime under Kim Jong-il; it will be harder to underwrite an untested leadership. For Xi Jinping, expected to become China's president over the next year, the first major foreign policy decision will be whether to shed North Korea or effectively adopt it as a province.
All indications are that Beijing will pursue the latter course, in no small part because of a bias among its leadership to support the status quo, rather than to confront dramatic change. And yet ''adopting'' North Korea could be dramatic in itself. China may go all in, doling out early invitations and new assistance packages to the young Mr. Kim, conditioning them on promises of economic reform.
While some observers hope that Kim Jong-il's death will unleash democratic regime change, China will work strongly against that possibility, especially if such efforts receive support from South Korea or the United States. Given that Beijing has the only eyes inside the North, Washington and Seoul could do little in response.
Yet even China's best-laid plans may come apart. The assistance may be too little, too late, especially given the problems the new leadership will face. A clear channel of dialogue involving the United States, China and South Korea is needed now more than ever.
And yet such a dialogue is completely absent since Kim Jong-il's stroke. Beijing has deflected every official and unofficial overture from Washington to have quiet discussions on potential North Korean instability. Before, China let its fears of Western interests get the better of it; wiser Chinese judgment should lead authorities to open such a channel now. The three sides should open with a conversation on all our fears about what could happen in a collapsing North -- loose nukes, refugee flows, artillery attacks -- and how each would respond.
With so little known about the inner workings of this dark kingdom, miscalculation by any side in response to developments inside the North is a very real possibility given the hair-trigger alerts of the militaries on the peninsula.
None of this will be easy. For China, the uncertainty surrounding North Korea comes against the backdrop of Mr. Obama's ''pivot'' to Asia and assertion that the region is America's new strategic priority. This has already created insecurities in Beijing that will make genuine dialogue with the United States even more challenging -- and thus all the more necessary.

HEADLINE: Easing Anxiety Of Fretful Asia Is Task of Heir

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; Su-hyun Lee contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea; Mark Landler from Washington; and Edward Wong from Beijing.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- The death of Kim Jong-il, the hermetic North Korea leader, threw the rest of Asia into deep anxiety Monday and reverberated across the Pacific. Friends and enemies of the nuclear-armed country fretted over whether it was now facing an unpredictable power struggle -- even as the official North Korean press proclaimed that Mr. Kim's cherubic-faced youngest son was his successor.
The son, Kim Jong-un, is such an unknown that the world did not even know what he looked like until last year. Believed to be in his 20s, he faces enormous uncertainty over his ability to retain power in one of the most opaque and repressive nations -- the last bastion of hard-line Communism.
Even if he can, questions loom about Kim Jong-un's ability to manage North Korea's ravaged economy, with its chronic shortages and deprivations, to avoid a complete collapse. 
''Kim Jong-un's first priority will be regime survival,'' said Chang Yong-seok, senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University in South Korea.
The North Korean announcement that Kim Jong-il, 69, had died of a heart attack while on a train trip Saturday -- an unexplained 48-hour delay that only further unnerved North Korea's neighbors -- sent South Korea scrambling into a high state of military alert. South Korea's stock market tumbled 3.4 percent. The leaders of South Korea, Japan and the United States all conferred urgently, reflecting both the surprise of Mr. Kim's death and the possibility of belligerent behavior from paranoid Pyongyang officials.
In Washington, the Obama administration, emphasizing the need for stability on the Korean Peninsula, delayed any decisions on the resumption of food aid or a new round of bilateral talks with the North Koreans. Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, told reporters, ''We need to see where they are and where they go as they move through their transition period.''
Even China, North Korea's most important ally and benefactor, appeared caught off guard by Mr. Kim's demise. Chinese leaders had been hoping that he would live at least a few more years to more solidly cement the succession of his son. On Monday, China was moving quickly to deepen its influence over senior officials in North Korea and particularly with those in the military, according to Chinese and foreign former government officials and analysts.
For now, the reclusive leadership is offering few clues as to what, if any, changes the death of the dictator could bring. It did, however, send a strong signal that at least for now, the powerful military and other parts of the nation's small, privileged ruling elite would go along with the Kim family's ambitions to extend its rule to a third generation.
Within hours of the announcement of Mr. Kim's death, North Korea's ruling Workers Party released a statement calling on the nation to unite ''under the leadership of our comrade Kim Jong-un.''
The younger Mr. Kim was also named head of the committee overseeing his father's funeral, set for Dec. 28 -- a move that some analysts interpreted as evidence that the transfer of power to the son was proceeding smoothly so far. Analysts said they expected the funeral to be an elaborate public display, not only of reverence for the deceased leader, but also of national unity behind the new one.
''The first test of the new leadership will be its handling of the death itself,'' said John Delury, a professor of international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul.
Some analysts said Kim Jong-il had used the three years after his stroke in 2008 to build support for this untested son. They also said that members of North Korea's ruling class might also recognize that, at least for now, they have no choice but to accept the succession: Mr. Kim's two older sons are seen as lazy playboys, while any move to reject the family could undermine the legitimacy of the entire leadership.
''Kim Jong-il used the years after his stroke to build a consensus among the elite that his son would be the face of North Korea after he was gone,'' said Kim Yeon-su, a professor of North Korean studies at the National Defense University in Seoul. He added that this was an easy face to sell: with plump cheeks, short-cropped hair and a hard gaze, Kim Jong-un looks strikingly similar to his grandfather Kim Il-sung, the founder of North Korea, still revered as a god.
What happens after the funeral, however, is fraught with uncertainty.
Nobody outside North Korea knows whether the military will accept the Kim succession. The only precedent is the last transition, when Kim Jong-il took over after the 1994 death of his father, Kim Il-sung, and uncertainty over his true authority lasted years. In that case, the son observed a three-year period of traditional mourning before formally taking control, reflecting the government's odd mixing of ancient Confucian monarchy with a 20th-century Stalinist personality cult.
With the death of Kim Jong-il, most analysts expect his anointed son to observe a similar period of mourning and to try to quickly consolidate his power. But while his father had more than a decade to build support between being named as heir and actually taking power, Kim Jong-un was publicly presented as successor in 2010, seen at a military parade with his father.
Masao Okonogi, a specialist on North Korea at Keio University in Tokyo, said that during the new leader's first few years, North Korea would most likely avoid confrontation with the United States and its allies, like South Korea.
That was the route taken by Kim Jong-il after his father's death, said Mr. Okonogi, and he seemed to hold out an olive branch by observing a 1994 deal negotiated by his father to freeze construction of two reactors suspected of use in North Korea's covert atomic weapons program. North Korea eventually suspended the deal in 2003, three years before testing its first nuclear weapon.
''Look for Kim Jong-un to make some offer, like to restart the six-party talks,'' Mr. Okonogi said, referring to stalled multilateral negotiations on dismantling the North's nuclear weapons. ''He'll need to reduce tensions with the United States in order to buy time.''
Some analysts said the new leader would probably use this time to try to fulfill his father's promise to turn North Korea into a ''strong and prosperous'' country by 2012. To do that, he must revive a moribund economy that ranks near the bottom of the world in many measures, including per capita gross domestic product of $1,800 per year, versus $30,000 in technologically advanced South Korea. The North's unwillingness to forsake the centrally planned economic system, its severe isolation and its utter reliance on food and fuel handouts from China and international aid groups have perpetuated or deepened the crisis.
Even if the son managed to stabilize the economy and opened North Korea to the outside world, it would take tens of billions of dollars' worth of new investment to raise the standard of living at a time when much of the rest of the world is in recession.
Given Kim Jong-un's relatively weak domestic position, Mr. Okonogi and other analysts said some kind of group rule could emerge. Much speculation has centered on whether Kim Jong-il's apparent second-in-command, his brother-in-law, Jang Song-taek, could emerge as a regent. However, analysts said there were no signs of that on Monday in the propaganda that followed the death announcement.
Beyond that, analysts said there were signs that Kim Jong-un has been following his father's example by starting to build a power base in the military. Last year, the younger Mr. Kim was proclaimed a four-star general by his father, who also named him vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, the country's most powerful body. Mr. Kim also appeared to burnish his credentials with the military by overseeing the artillery bombardment of a border island. He was also believed to have had a role in an attack last year on a South Korean warship; the South blamed the North for the sinking of the warship, but the North denied responsibility.
Mr. Kim could emerge beholden to the military, casting doubts on whether he can alter the country's direction. But Mr. Chang and other analysts said a change of generation might bring a re-evaluation of the North's isolation. They said they see hope in the new leader's childhood, spent at a boarding school in Switzerland, and his reported ability to speak English and German.
They say that growing numbers of North Korean officials are visiting neighboring China to see the success of its three-decade embrace of market economics under authoritarian rule. Recent visitors to North Korea say there are already signs of growing commercial links with China, including a new class of wealthy traders and an influx of Chinese-made consumer goods.
''The new leadership knows it will have to prove its mettle in the first few years,'' said Mr. Delury, who visited Pyongyang in September. ''Economic reform will be the single biggest challenge it faces.''

HEADLINE: Kim's Death Inspires Worries and Anxiety

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
LONDON -- The death of Kim Jong-il provoked uncertainty, anxiety and calls for a peaceful succession on Monday as governments within the region and beyond awaited some signal from North Korea about its nuclear intentions and the prospects, if any, for a new relationship with the world beyond its borders.
The uncertain response was colored by the secretive nature of the regime in Pyongyang, which has groomed Mr. Kim's youngest son, King Jong-un, as the heir-apparent, but allowed little of substance to be known about him. The trepidation deepened when the South Korean news agency reported that, before the announcement of Mr. Kim's death, North Korea tested an unspecified number of short-range missiles on Monday morning.
The reported test came as outsiders peering into the opaque and unpredictable politics of North Korea said they hoped the transition from father to son would be achieved without worsening tensions on the Korean peninsula. 
In Europe, moreover, government officials in Britain and Germany said the transition could offer North Korea an opportunity to enhance the lives of its impoverished people and to emerge from isolation by working to resolve the international stalemate over its nuclear arsenal
Even as state media in Pyongyang referred to Kim Jong-un as ''the great successor,'' Japan said it hoped Kim Jong-il's death ''does not have an adverse effect on the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula.''
A statement from the Chinese authorities -- whose reaction to potential turmoil in North Korea could dominate the regional response -- offered ''deep condolences'' and suggested a degree of alarm in Beijing.
In South Korea, facing North Korea's vast, nuclear-armed military, the armed forces went on high alert as President Lee Myung-bak called for calm and urged residents to pursue their normal lives, news reports said. President Lee was reported to have spoken to leaders in Washington and Tokyo as the Obama administration sought to assure its regional allies.
A White House statement said: ''We remain committed to stability on the Korean peninsula and to the freedom and security of our allies.''
Another key player was Russia. Bloomberg News quoted South Korea's presidential office as saying President Lee and his Russian counterpart, Dimitri A. Medvedev, agreed to work closely together for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula following the elder Mr. Kim's death.
In Beijing, China's Xinhua news agency quoted the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ma Zhaoxu, as saying Beijing was ''distressed'' to learn of the death. ''We express our grief about this and extend our condolences to the people of North Korea.''
Mr. Ma praised Mr. Kim as a ''great leader'' who made ''important contributions'' to relations with China. ''We are confident that the North Korean people will be able to turn their anguish into strength and unify as one,'' Reuters quoted the Chinese official as saying.
''China and North Korea will strive together to continue making positive contributions to consolidating and developing the traditional friendship between our two parties, governments and peoples and to preserving the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and the region.''
The measured Chinese response, offering continued support, was significant because the Pyongyang regime depends on China as an ally in its diplomacy and for help with food and fuel to support its crippled economy. In the months before his death, Mr. Kim traveled to China twice, most recently in August.
His secretive visits to China -- which were usually by train and were not announced until he had returned home -- were seen by regional specialists as important in securing Beijing's acceptance of the succession. From China's perspective, the uneasy relationship with North Korea is both an element in its contest with the United States and its allies in the region and a source of concern over the costs of economic and diplomatic support for the isolated regime in Pyongyang.
Some specialists said they discerned a note of alarm in the Chinese response, suggesting that Beijing, calculating that the elder Mr. Kim would survive for several years, had been taken by surprise. ''This has really come out of the blue. It's not like it had been rumored for a while giving everyone time to properly prepare,'' Cai Jian, an expert on Korean affairs at Fudan University in Shanghai, told Reuters.
''China's biggest worry will be over North Korea's stability, and China's aim will be to ensure the country remains stable,'' the expert said. ''I think security will be stepped up in North Korea, and China is also likely to tighten security along the border.''
In Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said at a news conference, ''We hope this sudden event does not have an adverse effect on the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula,'' Reuters reported after a hastily called ministerial meeting on security.
''Prime Minister Noda told members of the security meeting to strengthen information-gathering efforts, work closely and share information with relevant states including the United States, South Korea and China, and to prepare for any unexpected circumstances. The government hopes to take appropriate action as needed,'' Mr. Fujimura said.
But he added that government leaders at the security meeting had not decided whether to raise the level of alert for Japan's military.
''I ordered each division within the ministry to do their utmost in information gathering and in staying vigilant and watchful,'' a spokesman quoted Defense Minister Yasuo Ichikawa as saying.
Japan has no diplomatic ties with North Korea and the relationship is strained by distrust dating to Japan's 35-year occupation of the Korean peninsula in the 20th century, ending in 1945.
Like others in the region, Japan is also worried by the unpredictability and risks surrounding North Korea's nuclear capabilities. Efforts to normalize relations have been stalled for years over the emotional issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea and other concerns.
After the announcement of Mr. Kim's death, Asian markets fell and European stocks initially followed them lower before recovering somewhat.
In Australia, Treasurer Wayne Swan, who is also the acting prime minister, urged North Korea to act ''more responsibly both domestically and internationally,'' Bloomberg News said.
Foreign Secretary William Hague of Britain said in a statement that a new leader ''could be a turning point for North Korea.''
''We hope that their new leadership will recognize that engagement with the international community offers the best prospect of improving the lives of ordinary North Korean people,'' he said. ''We encourage North Korea to work for peace and security in the region and take the steps necessary to allow the resumption of the six-party talks on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.''
In Berlin, the German Foreign Ministry said it hoped the transition would offer a chance for North Korea to open to the outside world.
''It is, of course, an opportunity that things there will change,'' the German Foreign Ministry spokesman, Dirk Augustin, told reporters. ''We have clear demands to North Korea: It must abandon its nuclear program; the catastrophic situation of the people must improve; and political and economic reforms must be implemented.''
The French foreign minister, Alain Juppe, said Paris was hoping the people of North Korea would one day ''find freedom.''

HEADLINE: Cornell Alumnus Behind $350 Million Gift to Build Science School in the City

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA; Stephanie Strom contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The donor whose $350 million gift will be critical in building Cornell University's new high-tech graduate school on Roosevelt Island is Atlantic Philanthropies, whose founder, Charles F. Feeney, is a Cornell alumnus who made billions of dollars through the Duty Free Shoppers Group.
Mr. Feeney, 80, has spent much of the last three decades giving away his fortune, with large gifts to universities all over the world and an unusual degree of anonymity. Cornell officials revealed in 2007 that he had given some $600 million to the university over the years, yet nothing on its Ithaca campus -- where he graduated from the School of Hotel Management in 1956 -- bears Mr. Feeney's name. 
The $350 million gift, the largest in the university's history, was announced on Friday, but the donor was not named. Officials at Atlantic Philanthropies confirmed on Monday evening that it was Mr. Feeney, a native of Elizabeth, N.J., who is known for his frugality -- he flies coach, owns neither a home nor a car, and wears a $15 watch -- as well as his philanthropic generosity, particularly to medical research.
''This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity,'' Mr. Feeney said in a statement released by Atlantic Philanthropies, ''to create economic and educational opportunity on a transformational scale.''
The statement echoed what Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said hours earlier at a news conference officially crowning Cornell, with its partner, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, the winner of an intense international competition to build the new graduate school.
''Today will be remembered as a defining moment,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, making official what had been apparent since Cornell's chief rival, Stanford University, withdrew its bid for the campus on Friday. ''In a word, this project is going to be transformative.''
Revealing details of the $2 billion plan for the first time, Mr. Bloomberg and the presidents of the two universities said it would include a $150 million venture capital fund for start-up companies that agree to remain in New York for three years, as well as math and science education support for 10,000 city children. They estimated that building the campus would create 20,000 construction jobs, and that it would spin off 600 new businesses over the next generation, creating 30,000 more jobs and as much as $1.4 billion in tax revenue. The city is providing the land and up to $100 million in infrastructure improvements.
''New York City is positioned to become the new technology capital of the world,'' said David J. Skorton, the Cornell president, whose personal lobbying and fund-raising commitment to the project proved important in winning the competition.
That has long been a goal for Mr. Bloomberg, who noted that the city had only recently surpassed much-smaller Boston in attracting venture capital for high-tech start-ups, and that such businesses here face a chronic shortage of engineers.
Mr. Bloomberg has repeatedly said he could choose more than one winner. He emphasized during the announcement that the city was still negotiating with other schools in the Applied Sciences NYC initiative: Columbia University, which wants to make a new science center part of its expansion in West Harlem; Carnegie Mellon University, whose joint proposal with Steiner Studios is for a parcel the city offered in the Brooklyn Navy Yard; and a consortium led by New York University focused on Downtown Brooklyn.
''We're eager and hopeful that we'll be able to find ways to help them realize their proposals,'' he said.
He declined to cite specifics when asked about Stanford's decision to drop out, though he said that he had spoken to the university president, John Hennessy, and that he hoped Stanford might some day come to New York. ''The program that we want may not exactly fit what they want,'' he said.
City officials spent two months poring over 10,000 pages of documents submitted in seven proposals from 17 institutions. Mr. Bloomberg picked the Cornell-Technion plan, he said, because it was ''far and away the boldest and most ambitious'' and had an ''incredibly aggressive schedule.''
The two universities promise to start offering classes next September in temporary space, and to complete 300,000 square feet of space on Roosevelt Island by 2017 and more than 2 million square feet by 2037. Plans call for about 280 faculty members and 2,500 students in master's and doctoral programs, a larger contingent than the universities had proposed a few months ago.
The schools have also committed to training at least 200 teachers each year in science education.
The universities plan to organize the campus around three overlapping, shifting ''hubs'': technologies for ''connective media,'' applicable to everything from finance to social media; health care industries; and sustainable development, chosen in part to mesh with the city's existing strengths.
Each institution brought critical ingredients to winning the competition. Cornell needed Technion, which has played a role in Israel similar to the role Stanford has had in Silicon Valley, supplying talent and resources that help hundreds of companies set up shop near its Haifa campus. And Technion needed a local partner: ''6,000 miles, the Atlantic, the Mediterranean -- too far,'' the school's president, Peretz Lavie, noted at the news conference.
Asked what role he might play in financing the campus, the mayor, a billionaire, drew laughter when he said, drily, ''You assume that when they make the phone calls, I'd be on the list.''
Topping the list is Mr. Feeney, whose Atlantic Philanthropies had assets of $2.1 billion at the end of 2010, and has announced plans to give it all away over the next decade. The philanthropy was created in 1982 by Mr. Feeney, who has transferred virtually all of his assets to the charity. It has recently become involved with human rights causes. Last year, Atlantic distributed $285 million; the year before, $375 million.

PERSON: Kim Jong-il 

HEADLINE: Kim Jong-il, Dictator Who Turned North Korea Into a Nuclear State, Dies

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Choe Sang-hun contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Kim Jong-il, the reclusive dictator who kept North Korea at the edge of starvation and collapse, banished to gulags citizens deemed disloyal and turned the country into a nuclear weapons state, died Saturday morning, the North's official news media announced on Monday. He was reported to be 69.
He had been in ill health since a reported stroke in 2008.
Called the ''Dear Leader'' by his people, Mr. Kim, the son of North Korea's founder, remained an unknowable figure. Everything about him was guesswork, from the exact date and place of his birth to the mythologized events of his rise in a country formed by the hasty division of the Korean Peninsula at the end of World War II. 
North Koreans heard about him only as their ''peerless leader'' and ''the great successor to the revolutionary cause.'' Yet he fostered what was perhaps the last personality cult in the Communist world. His portrait hangs beside that of his father, Kim Il-sung, in nearly every North Korean household and building. Towers, banners and even rock faces across the country bear slogans praising him.
Mr. Kim was a source of fascination inside the Central Intelligence Agency, which interviewed his mistresses, tried to track his whereabouts and sought to psychoanalyze his motives. And he was an object of parody in American culture.
Short and round, he wore elevator shoes, oversize sunglasses and a bouffant hairdo -- a Hollywood stereotype of the wacky post-cold-war dictator. Mr. Kim was fascinated by film. He orchestrated the kidnapping of an actress and a director, both of them South Koreans, in an effort to build a domestic movie industry. He was said to keep a personal library of 20,000 foreign films, including the complete James Bond series, his favorite. But he rarely saw the outside world, save from the windows of his luxury train, which occasionally took him to China.
He was derided and denounced. President George W. Bush called him a ''pygmy'' and included his country in the ''axis of evil.'' Children's books in South Korea depicted him as a red devil with horns and fangs. Yet those who met him were surprised by his serious demeanor and his knowledge of events beyond the hermit kingdom he controlled.
''He was a very outspoken person,'' said Roh Moo-hyun, who as South Korea's president met Mr. Kim in Pyongyang, the North's capital, in 2007. ''He was the most flexible man in North Korea.''
Wendy Sherman, now the No. 3 official in the State Department, who was counselor to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and accompanied her to North Korea, said in 2008, ''He was smart, engaged, knowledgeable, self-confident, sort of the master-director of all he surveyed.''
Ms. Albright met Mr. Kim in October 2000 in what turned out to be a futile effort to strike a deal with North Korea over limiting its missile program before President Bill Clinton left office.
''There was no denying the dictatorial state that he ruled,'' Ms. Sherman said. ''There was no denying the freedoms that didn't exist. But at the time, there were a lot of questions in the U.S. about whether he was really in control, and we left with no doubt that he was.''
When Ms. Albright and Ms. Sherman sat down with him to talk through a 14-point list of concerns about North Korea's missile program, ''he didn't know the answers to every question, but he knew a lot more than most leaders would -- and he was a conceptual thinker,'' Ms. Sherman said.
And though he presided over a country that was starving and broke, he played his one card, his nuclear weapons program, brilliantly, first defying the Bush administration's efforts to push his country over the brink, then exploiting America's distraction with the war in Iraq to harvest enough nuclear fuel from his main nuclear reactor at Yongbyon to produce the fuel for six to eight weapons.
A Deal With Washington
Mr. Bush said during his first term in office that he would never tolerate a nuclear North Korea, but as his presidency wound down, many White House aides believed that he did exactly that.
It was not until the spring of 2007 that Mr. Bush was told by the Israelis that North Korea was helping Syria build a nuclear reactor; before the Syrians or the North Koreans were confronted with that evidence, Israel sent bombers on a secret mission to destroy the Syrian plant. The North Koreans have never explained their role.
By the time Mr. Bush left office, the administration had moved from four years of confrontation with the North to three years of halting negotiations. Led by Christopher R. Hill, a veteran American diplomat, the negotiations resulted in a deal that hawks hated: the United States agreed to supply North Korea with large amounts of fuel oil in return for the dismantlement of the aging Yongbyon plant, described by inspectors as a radioactive accident waiting to happen.
Mr. Kim played a weak hand very well. He succeeded in fending off pressure from Washington and Beijing, and in forcing Washington to talk and ultimately haggle with him. He dragged out negotiations, holding on to his nuclear fuel and whatever weapons he had produced, giving him continued leverage. It is that arsenal that now worries American and Asian officials, who fear that plotting generals and party leaders may fight to control it as they pick Mr. Kim's successor.
''When the history of this era is written,'' said Graham Allison, a Harvard professor and expert on nuclear proliferation, ''the scorecard will be Kim 8, Bush 0.''
But if ''he was the greatest master of survival, against all odds,'' said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul, South Korea, ''it was his own people who paid the price, and the price was pretty high.''
Mr. Kim's policy of songun, or ''army first,'' lavished the country's scarce resources on the military, at 1.1 million-strong the world's fifth largest. During his rule, the North expanded its ballistic missile arsenal and, in October 2006, became the eighth country in the world to conduct a nuclear test.
But as the North's economy shrank, its isolation deepened. Possibly as many as two million people -- almost 10 percent of the population -- died in a famine in the mid- to late 1990s brought on by incompetence and natural disasters.
''Do not expect me to change!'' is a popular catchphrase credited to Mr. Kim and used to exhort his people to remain loyal to his socialist ways.
Mr. Kim is believed to have been born in Siberia in 1941, when his father, Kim Il-sung, was in exile in the Soviet Union. But in North Korea's official accounts, he was born in 1942, in a cabin, Abe Lincoln-like. The cabin was in a secret camp of anti-Japanese guerrillas his father commanded on Mount Paektu, a holy piece of land in Korean mythology. The event, the official Korean Central News Agency would often say, was accompanied by the appearance of a bright star in the sky and a double-rainbow that touched the earth.
Little is known of his upbringing, apart from the official statement that he graduated in 1964 from Kim Il-sung University, one of the country's many monuments to his father. At the time, North Korea was enmeshed in the cold war, and the younger Kim watched many crises unfold from close up, including North Korea's seizure of the Pueblo, an American spy ship, in 1968. He appeared episodically at state events, rarely speaking. When he did, he revealed a high-pitched voice and little of his father's easygoing charisma.
In his youth and middle age, there were stories about his playboy lifestyle. There were tales of lavish meals at a time when his country was starving -- his cook wrote a book after leaving the country -- and his wavy hair and lifted heels, along with a passion for top-label liquor, made him the butt of jokes.
There was also speculation that he was involved in the 1983 bombing of a South Korean political delegation in Burma, now known as Myanmar, and that he had known of the kidnapping of Japanese citizens and perhaps had ordered it. Nothing was proved.
Washington put North Korea on its list of state sponsors of terrorism after North Korean agents planted a bomb that blew up a South Korean passenger jet in 1987 -- under instructions from Mr. Kim, according to one of the agents, who was caught alive.
Mr. Kim campaigned for power relentlessly. He bowed to his father at the front porch each morning and offered to put the shoes on the father's feet long before he was elected to the Politburo, at age 32, in 1974, said Hwang Jang-yop, a former North Korean Workers' Party secretary who had been a key aide for the Kim regime before his defection to Seoul in 1997.
''At an early age, Kim Jong-il mastered the mechanics of power,'' Mr. Hwang said.
It was not until 1993, as the existence of the Yongbyon nuclear plant and North Korea's nuclear weapons ambitions became publicly known, that Mr. Kim appeared to be his father's undisputed successor. That year, he became head of the National Defense Commission, the North's most powerful agency, in charge of the military.
In 1994, in a showdown with the United States, North Korea threatened to turn its stockpile of nuclear fuel into bombs. It was the closest the two countries came to war since the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. The standoff was defused when Kim Il-sung welcomed former President Jimmy Carter, who pushed Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kim into a deal.
Within a month, however, the country's founder and ''Great Leader'' was dead. Many doubted at the time that the younger Kim would take over. There were rumors of a military coup, and theories that he would be allowed to keep his fast cars and to consort with visiting European ''entertainers'' as long as he did not try to run the country. Like much intelligence about North Korea, that turned out to be wrong.
Mr. Kim has three sons, any of whom could potentially have succeeded him. But his home life is a mystery.
His oldest son, Kim Jong-nam, would have been the natural choice to succeed him. But he had a handicap: his mother never married Mr. Kim. Since his health crisis, in 2008, Mr. Kim had been grooming his third son, Kim Jong-un, to be his successor. The son is believed to be in his late 20s.
Mr. Kim consolidated power in the late 1990s, flexing his muscle by testing a North Korean missile over Japan and sending Japan, a much larger and more powerful nation, into a panic. It was through episodes like this that Mr. Kim learned true power: that he could blackmail his way to survival.
But he could not learn to feed his own people, and his country became even more dependent on China for food and fuel and on ''humanitarian'' donations from South Korea and the United States. In June 2000, Mr. Kim played host in Pyongyang to the first summit meeting with a South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, since the peninsula was divided more than five decades before.
Pressuring Pyongyang
The South Korean leader received the Nobel Peace Prize later that year, though his reputation was soon tainted by revelations that a South Korean company had paid off the North Koreans, and presumably their leader, to arrange the trip.
Once President Bush took office in January 2001, all cooperation between Washington and Seoul over how to deal with the North came to a crashing halt. Mr. Bush rejected the South's ''sunshine policy'' of engagement with North Korea, and ended Clinton-era talks that he viewed as dangerous appeasement.
A concerted effort to push North Korea over the brink began, setting off an uprising against Kim Jong-il's leadership. To the degree Washington could, it cut off North Korean trade, its access to cash and its ability to export weapons and drugs. Mr. Bush called Mr. Kim a ''tyrant'' who ''starves his own people.''
In October 2002, the administration presented North Korea with evidence that Pyongyang had secretly tried to evade the 1994 nuclear agreement with the United States by purchasing equipment to enrich uranium from Abdul Qadeer Khan, a founder of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. The evidence was strong -- the United States had tracked the shipments with spy satellites -- but the C.I.A. overstated its confidence that the North was building separate, secret nuclear facilities.
That led to a confrontation that changed the nature of the North Korean threat. Mr. Kim ordered the ouster of United Nations inspectors who had been stationed at Yongbyon. The United States pressed for an end to fuel shipments to the North. In retaliation, from January through March 2003, just as the United States military was barreling toward the invasion of Iraq, Mr. Kim did what his father had come so very close to doing nine years before: he announced that he was reprocessing spent fuel rods into bomb fuel.
After the invasion of Iraq, Mr. Kim was not seen for nearly two months; there were reports that he had gone into hiding, thinking he was Mr. Bush's next target. He emerged only to start another confrontation in 2006, first with a series of missile tests, then, in October, with the North's first nuclear test.
Some Asian and American officials interpreted Mr. Kim's decision as a fit of pique because ''six-party talks'' -- negotiations among North Korea, China, South Korea, Russia, the United States and Japan -- were moving so slowly. Others said Mr. Kim had simply learned from Saddam Hussein's mistakes and determined that he would never face the United States without a nuclear weapon.
The test itself was something of a fizzle; it ended with a sub-kiloton explosion, less than a tenth of the power of the bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945. But Mr. Kim had made his point. He was condemned in the United Nations, and China briefly cut off oil and other trade. But within months the United States agreed on a new series of negotiations.
While there were many starts and stops, and disagreements over what it means to dismantle a nuclear program fully, Mr. Kim agreed in the summer of 2007 to stop the production of new nuclear fuel at Yongbyon. By then he presumably had all the weapons he needed.
The plant began to be dismantled, and in the summer of 2008 the Bush administration talked about starting on the hardest negotiations of all, over the price of giving up North Korea's nuclear arsenal. Mr. Kim died before serious talks could begin.
As soon as President Obama took office, Mr. Kim ordered a second nuclear test, this one more successful than the first. And he waited out the predictable hail of international condemnation. The move aborted any efforts by Mr. Obama to engage with the North Koreans. And the next three years were spent with the United States and South Korea demanding that the North live up to the denuclearization pledges it had made during the Bush administration.
Instead, it did the opposite. In November 2010, the North Koreans showed a visiting American scientist from Stanford University, Siegfried Hecker, an apparently working uranium enrichment plant that the country had been building for years and that the C.I.A. had missed, though the agency had been right about other secret facilities. The plant gave North Korea a new way to produce nuclear weapons, even as his people fell into another food shortage.
The same year, the North made two attacks against the South Korean military, sinking a ship and later shelling an island near Northern waters. The episodes caused the United States and South Korea to conduct new joint exercises, even while the Chinese, apparently fearing a complete collapse of the North Korean regime, increased its economic aid.
Despite his ill health, Mr. Kim was reported to have visited one of the units that attacked the South, to hand out medals, and recently managed one last visit to his benefactors in China. But it is unclear whether his son and presumed successor accompanied him.

HEADLINE: For the Big Players of Wall St., the Holiday Party Is Still Over

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
Three years after the financial crisis, the Grinch still hovers over Wall Street.
In the precrisis era, big banks were renowned for their extravagant holiday parties. Goldman Sachs once rented out huge halls for its end-of-year galas, which featured appearances by performers such as Harry Connick Jr. and Bette Midler. In 2007, Morgan Stanley took over several floors of Lotus, then a popular Manhattan nightclub.
But, mindful of mass layoffs, flagging profits and sustained anger on Main Street, the nation's largest banks have canceled firm-sponsored celebrations or moved them in-house to avoid the costs and the criticism. 
For the fourth year in a row, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have shelved their official holiday parties. The investment banking divisions of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America have also decided against them. But groups of employees at all five firms were permitted to hold - and pay for - their own festivities.
European firms, hit hard by the sovereign debt crisis, have also scaled back. The Royal Bank of Scotland, which is still part-owned by the British government, allowed some division heads to partially subsidize their employee parties with up to 10, or about $15, a person in company money. But employees in the American branches of the bank had to pay for their own parties this year, according to a company spokeswoman.
Corporate holiday parties, in general, are on the wane. This year, only 74 percent of companies are holding them, down from 95 percent in 2006, according to a survey of 120 companies conducted by Amrop Battalia Winston, an executive search firm.
The dearth of company-sponsored holiday parties has jolted the owners of the bars, restaurants and lounges that housed the parties, the tabs for which could run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Steven Greenberg, the owner of 230 Fifth, a rooftop lounge in Manhattan, estimates that Wall Street nightlife used to account for 20 percent of his business.
Now, bank parties at 230 Fifth ''are nonexistent, period,'' said Mr. Greenberg, though he said that business from foreign tourists has helped replace lost bookings. ''They're concerned about doing layoffs and on the same day having a press report saying that they're having a big holiday party,'' he said.
Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan, and Citigroup all declined to comment.
With large American firms cutting back on holiday parties, private equity firms, hedge funds and others that operate farther from the public eye are taking their place.
Bridgewater Associates, the giant hedge fund headquartered in Westport, Conn., rented out the Webster Bank Arena, a 10,000-seat arena in nearby Bridgeport, for its holiday party, according to several people with knowledge of the event. The Royal Bank of Canada held a party for its New York office at Chelsea Piers, in a high-end event space that can accommodate up to 2,000 guests, according to two people who attended but were not authorized to speak on the record about it.
Credit Suisse's investment banking division held its celebration at Bar Basque, owned by the restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow. The bank provided an open bar and food including chicken parmesan sandwiches and fried olives.
Still, even that party ''paled in comparison to last year's,'' said a person who attended Credit Suisse's party and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
At banks without official parties, some employees are making do with less.
A group of Morgan Stanley employees held an unofficial holiday party with an ''ugly sweater'' theme at an Upper East Side bar, according to a person with knowledge of the event, while other employees of the firm partied at Dream, a hotel with a rooftop bar in Midtown Manhattan. A group of R.B.S. employees held an informal event at the Powerhouse Lounge in Jersey City.
Other firms have emphasized charitable giving programs intended to draw attention to their good works. One year after holding a grand gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art to celebrate its 25th anniversary, the Blackstone Group, the private equity firm co-founded by Stephen A. Schwarzman, held a coat drive at its holiday party, a low-key affair in the Waldorf Astoria hotel, according to a person with knowledge of the event.
Those kinds of events can provide the morale boost of a holiday party without the reputational risks, experts say.
''At this point, the crazy, expensive caviar nights don't make sense, but maybe something more subdued would be more appropriate,'' said Alison Brod, who runs a New York-based public relations firm. ''It's pretty sad to do nothing.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: New Leader for Urban Institute

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: Sarah Rosen Wartell, a housing expert and economic policy analyst, will become the president of the Washington-based research organization in February. 

 BODY:
Sarah Rosen Wartell, a housing expert and economic policy analyst, will become the president of the Urban Institute in February, the Washington-based research organization said Tuesday.
Ms. Wartell is the co-founder of the Center for American Progress, the progressive policy research organization and advocacy group, and currently heads its housing finance program. She will succeed Robert D. Reischauer, the former head of the Congressional Budget Office, at the helm of the 43-year-old nonpartisan institute. 
In an interview, Ms. Wartell said that she hoped to bolster the institute's profile and make its research more relevant to policy debates. "Urban has this really remarkable collection of scholars and analytical tools and models," she said. "My goal is to protect what Urban is - a place of tremendous and renowned scholarship and research - while trying to make its studies more accessible and visible, so that policy makers of all political stripes can use them."
She cited the influential Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, as an example. "It has done a very good job of doing relatively quick turnaround analysis of tax policy," she said. "They're a go-to site, and people, whether proponents or opponents of a proposal, rely on it." 
Before helping to found the Center for American Progress in 2003, Ms. Wartell served in the Clinton administration as deputy assistant to the president for economic policy and as deputy director of the National Economic Council. She also worked in the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Ms. Wartell said she hoped to continue working on housing finance issues while managing the Urban Institute, which has 10 centers on policy topics including health care costs, poverty, criminal justice, immigration and unemployment. "How we rebuild housing finance in the wake of the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac," she said. "That's obviously not going away as a problem."

HEADLINE: Yale and Columbia Reimburse Gay Employees for Extra Taxes

BYLINE: TARA SIEGEL BERNARD


HIGHLIGHT: Columbia and Yale will soon begin to reimburse its gay employees for the extra costs that they owe on the value of their partners' health insurance. 

 BODY:
Two Ivy League universities will soon begin reimbursing some of its gay and lesbian employees for the extra taxes they incur when their partners are covered by their health insurance.
Both Columbia and Yale University will begin covering these extra costs on Jan. 1.
Heterosexual married couples don't owe the tax because they are viewed as an economic unit in the eyes of the federal government. But under federal law, employer-provided health benefits for domestic partners are counted as taxable income (if the partner is not considered a dependent), so same-sex couples are taxed on the value of the coverage. On top of that, the employees cannot use pretax dollars to pay for their premiums, unlike their opposite-sex married counterparts.
Over the last couple of years, an increasing number of employers have begun to reimburse their gay and lesbian employees because they cannot avoid the tax by getting married (at least for federal purposes). We've been keeping tabs on the growing number of companies who are adopting the policy on this chart.
Yale, which is in Connecticut, where same-sex marriage is legal, will cover at least a portion of the costs for employees with same-sex spouses and those who are joined by a civil union (employees who merely have same-sex domestic partners are not covered). In addition, the benefit will only be extended to employees whose spouses are not eligible for coverage elsewhere. And instead of calculating each person's liability, it will pay eligible employees $125 a month, or $1,500 a year, to cover the costs, a figure it came up with by averaging the costs across employees. The payments will be included in each paycheck.
The inequity became readily apparent last year, when Yale's payroll system made an error and failed to withhold these taxes. Employees who were affected received a letter that said the university would pay the tax and deduct the amount it paid from employees' future paychecks, which some employees said they felt wasn't fair.
Columbia University, which is in New York, another state where gay marriage is legal, said it would pay eligible employees with same-sex partners $1,000 over the course of the year. The policy will go into effect next year for nonunion salaried employees. The benefit would need to be negotiated through collective bargaining for unionized employees, a Columbia spokesman said.
Columbia and Yale join Bowdoin College, which adopted the policy in 2010, and Syracuse University, which began reimbursing its employees in January 2011. Syracuse calculates each eligible employee's individual liability and then pays up to $1,000 over the year. Graduate assistants are also covered, but they receive their credit as a lump sum at the end of the calendar year.
Do you know of any other universities that have adopted similar policies?

HEADLINE: Answers to Reader Questions About Law School

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Answers to a selection of reader questions about legal education. 

 BODY:
On Sunday, The Times's David Segal concluded a series of articles about the economics of law schools, with an article on the cover of Sunday Business, For Law Schools, a Price to Play the A.B.A.'s Way. The article notes that the American Bar Association's rules for accreditation are a significant factor in the costs of legal education, which may in turn limit the availability of low-cost legal services.
Readers had plenty to say about the article, and others submitted questions for Mr. Segal to Economix. Below are his responses to a selection.
Q.
Some law schools now offer an accelerated, 2 year program. Given the ABA and the law schools exercise dominion over who is let into the profession, and given the training at these schools is at most fair, and at worst inadequate training for actual legal work, and real training takes place on the job, isn't it problematic to require 3 years of questionable "training," and 100K-200K tuition loads, as a sort of "cost of admission" to the profession, disconnected from actual value of training received, especially at lower tier schools, where the students cannot hope to ever pay off their debt?
I understand the ABA wishes to limit entry to the profession so they can artificially maintain an above-market wage at top firms... but isn't this problematic (morally, economically, politically, socially, I'm not sure) when the poor have extremely limited access to legal assistance?

-Mike, from Boston
A.
 Not only is three years of law school the standard, but in the United States, you need to attend college before you can become a law student. For nearly every new lawyer, that means seven years of school, for a degree that, as you and others have pointed out, could take two years and some apprentice work. 
Is it crazy to train an 18-year-old to practice law? Must he or she first attend college? Well, the example of Britain is instructive. Law there is an undergraduate degree. 
The point isn't that all lawyers should take two or three years of legal training, and skip college. It's that right now, there is just one option in this country - the A.B.A. accredited diploma, which requires seven years of school. No wonder so many grads enter the working world with a mountain of debt. And no wonder there aren't a host of price points for people in need of legal services.
Q.

-Jonathan, from New York City
A.
 By anointing the A.B.A. as the regulator of law schools, the Department of Education put the organization in a bit of an awkward spot. It has been in the past, and always will be in the future, under the suspicion that it has, at minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest. One could always wonder: Was this decision or that decision about limiting the number of lawyers made because of concerns for current members. And if so, is that fair?
In effect, the A.B.A. is the legal profession's version of a union. And when you ask a union, "How many others should be allowed into your trade?" the answer is clouded - or again, appears to be clouded - by the interests of those already in the business.
To your last question - Americans have a long-held distaste for regulated markets and central planning. And in a way, that is what you are asking: Why can't this group just sensibly predict the size of the legal market, then tailor the number of graduates to the market's size and fluctuations?
That's a tricky business even for a disinterested party. But the A.B.A. is not a disinterested party. And it is unlikely to consider so-called access to justice issues as it makes that calculation. Look at New York City. Something like 1 percent of litigants in debt cases and foreclosure cases can afford a lawyer. In divorce cases, both husband and wife are typically unrepresented. Even middle-class consumers are unable to afford lawyers in many parts of the country. 
That's why the United States placed last among high-income nations when it comes to the affordability of lawyers, in the survey I cited in the piece.
So. How big is the market? How many lawyers do we need? That depends. By one measure - the number of unemployed lawyers today - the market seems oversaturated. By another - the number of people who need but don't hire lawyers because they can't afford them - the market seems desperately wanting. 
Q.

- Evan, from New York City
A.
 It is entirely possible that Duncan's grads will face the same practical knowledge deficit that I described in an earlier story. As for the actual number of lawyers needed in the Appalachians of Tennessee and Kentucky, can't help you there.
You're raising good questions that I did not endeavor to answer. For practical reasons. When you write a series like this one, you try to avoid repeating yourself. Another way to put that is: You ask one question at a time, because you make one core point at a time. The story of Duncan teases out the the role of A.B.A. accreditation in the cost of tuition. But absolutely, the questions I raised in other stories can be asked of Duncan, too. It's just that those questions can be asked of every law school. What makes Duncan singular and I think particularly interesting is that it is now knocking on the door of the A.B.A. and asking to be let in. Which neatly illuminates how much it costs for nothing more than the privilege of knocking.
Q.
Having to hire a "brain surgeon" when what you need is a "plumber" is an example of the wrongs of the legal system, to paraphrase Professor Morris. But so is having to hire a plumber when what you need is a brain surgeon, especially if your adversary has a team of brain surgeons at the ready. Loosening the ABA regulations could also mean that poorer people in court are left with lawyers with less preparation than their adversaries. In addition, hiring - at legal aid agencies included - is still based on law school prestige. Expansion of ABA certifications might therefore not have the large effect the article hints.
The focus on ABA should instead be on (1) increasing funding from the government or other sources to legal services corporations-which are sorely in decline, as the Times pointed out back in August; and (2) increasing Loan Repayment Assistance Programs, so that the law students who do take these jobs can do so realistically - not with frills, but with roofs. Without these changes, law students will continue to look for only for the kind of work that is realistic to repay bills, not just the kind of law that is needed. The cycle will continue.
- Beth, from Minnesota
A.
 I don't agree. There isn't enough government money to fund legal aid for the needs of the poor and middle class who now can't afford lawyers. More manageable loan repayment is a fine idea, but again, not even close to sufficient. 
Why? This gets to the other question of my story: who gets to define who practices law? The United States definition is now exceptionally narrow and limited to one species of student - one who has four years of college and three years of A.B.A.-approved training. 
Until that definition is expanded, this country will lag far behind when it comes to access to justice. Prof. Morriss's point is that you sometimes need a plumber. Not that you always need a plumber. By all means, let's keep producing the brain surgeon version of an attorney. There will always be work for those graduates, though there is less of it these days. 
But why not produce an attorney, or legal adviser, for lower-grade skirmishes? There are thousands that go un-lawyered every day in this country because most lawyers are simply priced out of that market.
Q.
- ellewilson, from Vermont
A.
 Good question.
Q.
Our housing bubble was formed from the same combination of private profit (incentive) and socialized cost (moral hazard).
A financial bubble forms when everyone is buying a good regardless of value and using debt to do so. The education bubble is still swelling, but it will burst.
- J. Sweeney, from West Chester, Pa.
A.
 Another answer I've heard is to force schools to assume some of the risk of their graduates' loans. Put some of their skin in the game. That might make them less willing to sign up students who are unlikely to find work. But as I say in the story, that measure, and the ones you describe, may help bring the cost down at some of the high-end schools. What interested me in the story of Duncan was the fee at the entry level - the price of gaining admission to the A.B.A. 
Q.
- Bill Day, from Washington, D.C.
A.
 If you see blanket hostility to lawyers in my story, I am mystified as to where you found it.
But to your point. Consider the case of C.P.A.'s. If you're a corporation and want a top-level accountant, by all means, spend a lot of money on a C.P.A. He or she has spent a lot of money getting trained, and you'll pay serious money and get extremely good service. 
What if you just need to go to a retail tax preparer, for a simple tax return? You can get an accountant at any number of national chains - I do - but but he or she won't necessarily be a C.P.A. You'll pay a fraction of the price, and you'll get your taxes done.
Q.
- Lilly, from Indianapolis
A.
 It would help. Again, see above for my arguments about other types of legal degrees. But you're right - U.S. News isn't helping. Right now, its algorithm gives a school credit for spending more money on students. On one level this looks sensible - a school that spends on books and teachers, etc., may well be better than one that scrimps on same. 
But as a professor I spoke to put it, a law school could literally burn a huge sum of money and, as long as the flames were meant to teach something to the students - the craziness of the U.S. News algorithm, perhaps? - the school would benefit in the rankings.

HEADLINE: Benton Harbor: An Addendum by Chris Savage

BYLINE: JONATHAN MAHLER


HIGHLIGHT: A missive from Michigan. 

 BODY:
While I was in Benton Harbor, Mich., reporting this week's cover article, I met a guy named Chris Savage and his wife one night for some pizza and beer. (We also went the beach and watched a pretty spectacular sunset on Lake Michigan.)
Chris is a scientist, but he also writes an indispensable blog on the Michigan political scene, eclectablog.com.He's written a lot about Benton Harbor, particularly in the context of the state's emergency-manager legislation, known as PA 4 (Public Act 4). Over the weekend, he wrote me a characteristically insightful e-mail about the legislation that I think makes great supplemental reading to the story itself. It follows, only very slightly edited, for space:
I wanted to comment broadly on the issue of PA 4 since it plays such an important role, both in Benton Harbor and in the state as a whole. When Michigan first passed an Emergency Financial Manager law under the Blanchard administration (a Democrat) as Public Act 101 (later strengthened under Public Act 72), it did not contain provisions that allowed for the dismissal of local elected officials or for the power to break contracts as the current law, passed this past spring, does. It's notable that what used to be called Emergency Financial Managers are now, since the passage of PA 4, simply called Emergency Managers (E.M.'s). The removal of the word "financial" is important because it indicates that these men and women have control over more than just "balancing the books."
As I wrote back in July, the new law gives the E.M.'s control over far more than just the day-to-day finances of a city or school district.
Here's a sample of his powers:
1) Assume complete control over local governments and can prohibit elected officials' access to office facilities, e-mail and internal information systems
2) Remove current department heads, administrators
3) Sell, lease, convey, assign or other use or transfer assets of the local government or school district
4) Dissolve or disincorporate the local government and assign its assets
5) Develop academic and educational plans
6) Receive and disburse all federal, state and local funds earmarked for the local government or school district
7) "Take any other action or exercise any power or authority of any officer, employee, department, board, commission or other similar entity of the local government whether elected or appointed"

No. 5 should give us all pause. Why should E.M.'s, whose only qualification be that they "have a minimum of five years' experience and demonstrable expertise in business, financial or local or state budgetary matters" be setting academic and educational plans? I have seen the training materials for the training sessions held for potential E.M.'s, and they contain nothing that would help an E.M. develop academic and educational plans. In fact, the trainings were run primarily by representatives from companies who stand to benefit financially as E.M.'s outsource many of the tasks normally handled by a municipality or school district. This is a big red flag for those of us who worry that PA 4 is a not-so-subtle vehicle for forcing privatization of our governments and schools.
Perhaps more important, as it relates to your article, E.M.'s are not tasked with solving the systemic problems that brought the cities and schools to the crisis point where an E.M. is being considered. As is very clear from your piece, Benton Harbor isn't where it is today solely because its finances were mismanaged. The crisis was decades in the making, and nothing that Joe Harris has done will solve the crushing poverty, rampant unemployment and under-employment, poor education and lack of experience and training in governance that created this "emergency." Once Harris departs, all of those problems will remain, and there is little reason to believe that they won't be right back in the same emergency situation in a few short years.
Finally, it's hard to look at which cities are being impacted without questioning why PA 4 is having such an astonishingly disparate impact on majority African-American cities. Benton Harbor, Flint, Pontiac and Ecorse are all cities that are more than half African-American. In fact, if Detroit and Inkster are assigned E.M.'s (both of which are in the process), literally more than half of the African-Americans in the state of Michigan will be without local representative government, and their cities will be controlled by a single individual. While I won't argue that this is intentional, it certainly is a result and something that has justifiably come to the attention of U.S. Justice Department.
I understand that Michigan cities like Benton Harbor are struggling and help is needed. The Snyder administration's recent cuts in revenue sharing to cities and cuts to our public schools have only made matters much worse. My contention is that we must start from the baseline that democracy, even at the local level, must be preserved. Democracy isn't always pretty and "the people" sometimes elect unqualified representatives. But that's not an excuse to disenfranchise our citizens and democracy should be sacrosanct, the baseline from which we evaluate any potential solution. I reject the notion that this is the only answer.
Chris Savage

HEADLINE: Why 'Solutions Journalism' Matters, Too

BYLINE: DAVID BORNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: Our crises and problems are well covered in the media, but solutions to those problems often aren't. That can change. 

 BODY:
On Friday, I did a recap of stories that we had featured in Fixes over the past year - and I was surprised to discover that many of the organizations we'd written about had managed to expand their work, even in a difficult economy and political context. Looking back at the range of changes that had occurred during the past year, I was reminded of the remark by Robert Kennedy: "Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance."
In this modest sampling of changes, ripples were clearly being sent forth in multiple directions. In fact, some of the changes could be described as small waves - they included measurable progress mitigating homelessness, improving the foster care system, reducing rural poverty, addressing health disparities, and alleviating a variety of other problems.

In the comments, readers expressed appreciation for being afforded this view of reality. Janet, from Salt Lake City, wrote: "Thank you for this summary of wonderful work being done throughout the world. I needed this news." Marcia, from California, commented that she planned to use the stories to stimulate action among people she knew. "Since democracy begins locally, I will share your column with local leaders in my small community, which has a large low-income, uneducated parent population and high unemployment as well as a strong community spirit to promote the common welfare." She added: "Responsibility for action is too often shoved off to elected officials, bureaucrats and not assumed by local citizens."
A reader named Bdcbrooklyngirl added that the column was a welcome counterpoint to the "unending gush of we're-going-to-Hell-in-a-handbasket I feel bombarded with daily." She asked why there couldn't be more reporting about solutions in the news. "Bringing these things to the forefront of our national conversation could be the biggest and most effective single change yet," she commented. "It certainly couldn't hurt."
Each week in Fixes, readers make similar comments about the relative scarcity of solution-focused stories in the news and their desire for more of them. It's a sentiment that is shared by many. In a 1997 study of attitudes toward the press, the nonprofit polling and research group Public Agenda found that 79 percent of respondents agreed with the statement: "A reporter's job is to cover bad news." And, in 2008, the Associated Press published a study (pdf) which found that young consumers of news felt "debilitated by information overload and unsatisfying news experiences."
"Adding to news fatigue among these participants was the widespread belief that 'all news today is negative,'" the report noted. "Over and over again in the study, the negativity of news - tragedy, crisis, war, terror - added to the desire to tune out." (p.43) "The implication for the news industry," the researchers added, was to "counter the audience's anxiety and overload with compelling content delivered in innovative ways." (p.44)
Obviously, we think that solutions should be investigated and examined more often in the news - or we wouldn't be writing this column. But we recognize that journalists also have to be especially mindful to avoid reporting that could be construed as advocacy. (There's already enough unadulterated opinion - even propaganda - that passes for news today. As Daniel Patrick Moynihan is reputed to have said: "Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.") So when we draw attention to organizations because we think there's something they're doing right, as opposed to wrong, we try to be extra thorough in our reporting - giving more weight to evidence than arguments of the he-said-she-said or ideological variety.
By their nature, solution-oriented stories tend to be forward-looking - we usually explore ideas we believe have potential to grow, as opposed to events that occurred in the past - so there is always considerable scope to get it wrong, and that adds to the challenge. My big fear is writing about something I think is sensible, effective and efficient only to discover that it's wrong-headed, harmful and wasteful. Feedback from readers is a big help. In every column, I learn from readers' criticisms, experiences and expertise.
As readers have noted, solutions remain an under-represented part of the news - particularly given the astonishing changes that have occurred around the world in recent years. Over the past two or three decades, millions of organizations have sprouted up globally to tackle problems in new ways - doing everything from protecting marine life, grasslands and forests, advancing rights and opportunities for women, gays and lesbians, disabled people and ethnic minorities, organizing to overthrow dictators, and inventing or restructuring institutions to deliver things like fresh water, health care, education, financial services and electricity to the world's poor.
The collective explosion of nonprofits, nongovernmental organizations, social-purpose businesses, "benefit corporations," dot-orgs, dot-nets, and so forth, has been described by scholars as a major global "power shift." Bill Drayton, the founder of Ashoka, the leading fellowship of social entrepreneurs, has coined these changes the rise of the "citizen sector." The author Paul Hawken believes that the sheer number of organizations and people pursuing social change represents the "largest movement the world has ever seen." But unlike business people, movie makers, scientists or home gardeners, there's still no section where readers can regularly expect to find news about their efforts.
The majority of publishers, editors and reporters contend that the primary role of journalism is to expose wrongdoing. The general public also supports this function. But, today, along with all the other changes in media, it's fair to say that what is sometimes called solutions journalism should be seen as a legitimate branch of reporting - one that needs to be held to the same standards of accuracy and professionalism as other forms (rather than seen as a kind of fluffy feel-good feature to be offered, say, during the holiday season).
Journalism is a feedback mechanism to help society self-correct. We know from behavioral science that information about a problem alone is rarely sufficient to generate corrective action. People need to know what they can do - and how. That doesn't mean including a little "good news" now and them, but regularly presenting people with innovative ideas and realistic pathways and possibilities that remain outside their view frame. In this sense, solutions journalism needs to be interwoven with traditional journalism - it rounds out the story, so to speak.
Without it, society suffers. Over the past 35 years, Americans' confidence in virtually every major institution - medicine, education, corporations, organized labor and religion, the press, and all three branches of government - has declined markedly. (Only the military has risen in esteem.) "[The baby boomers] initial suspicion of the Pentagon and two presidents, Johnson and Nixon, spread like kudzu into a general cynicism about all established institutions," the journalist Michael Kinsley has written. "This reflexive and crippling cynicism is now shared across the political spectrum."
In Public Opinion, the journalist Walter Lippmann commented, "The way in which the world is imagined determines at any particular moment what men will do." The media plays a big part in how people imagine reality; journalists shape perceptions by what they choose to highlight and what they overlook. Reporters will always be needed to play the crucial watchdog role - uncovering malfeasance, corruption and betrayals of trust. But increasingly, there is a new problem that the press needs to be addressing as well - it's not so much about people doing terrible things that are hidden from view, it's about people doing remarkable things that are hidden from view. John Locke wrote, "It is one thing to show a man that he is in error, and another to put him in possession of truth."
In that spirit, we urge you to keep reading, keep sending us ideas, and keep being critical - holding us to the highest standards of journalism. And as Caroline, from Brooklyn wrote, "Kudos to all [the] organizations, and the people who have made positive change in their communities. May 2012 be even brighter!"

AT&T Ends $39 Billion Bid for T-Mobile | AT&T on Monday ended its effort to buy T-Mobile USA, acknowledging that it could not overcome stiff opposition by the Obama administration to form the nation's biggest cellphone service provider.
The decision to scrap the $39 billion takeover - which would have been the biggest deal of the year - is a major setback for AT&T, which had pinned its hopes for growth on the acquisition. The company wanted T-Mobile's cellular airwaves, or spectrum, to relieve its congested network and offer faster service for data-hungry devices like the iPhone.

HEADLINE: Cutting the Corporate Tax Rate Is No Economic Panacea

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Corporate taxes in the United States are not particularly high compared with other nations when they are accurately compared, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Last week, a nice woman contacted me to see if I was interested in the work of a bipartisan coalition she worked for that was promoting a cut in the corporate tax rate. I told her that I was disinclined to believe that it would have much impact but didn't take the time to explain why. This is why.
First, insofar as taxes affect businesses, more than 90 percent of businesses are not really affected by the corporate tax. They are sole proprietorships, partnerships or S corporations that are essentially taxed only on the individual tax schedule. 
The corporate tax affects only C corporations, legal entities separate and distinct from their owners, the shareholders. The income of C corporations is taxed twice - once at the corporate level and again when the corporation's income is paid out to its owners.
Therefore, the tax burden on C corporations is a function of both the corporate tax rate and the personal tax rate on dividends. To be valid, an international comparison of corporate taxes must take both into account.

This table uses data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development: 
The inclusion of taxes both at the corporate level and on dividends changes our perspective on which countries are high tax and which are low tax. For example, Ireland has the lowest statutory corporate tax rate among O.E.C.D. countries, yet is still a relatively high-tax country because of the high tax rate it imposes on dividends. By contrast, Japan has the highest statutory corporate tax rate but only the 12th highest overall rate because it has one of the lowest tax rates on dividends.
Those advocating a cut in the corporate tax rate today generally ignore the tax on dividends, as well as many other provisions of United States and foreign tax law that may reduce the effective tax rate well below the statutory rate. 
A recent study found that only 25 percent of the largest American corporations pay anywhere close to the statutory corporate tax rate of 35 percent on their earnings, while 40 percent pay less than half that rate. 
Indeed, General Electric, the nation's largest corporation, paid no federal corporate taxes in the United States in 2010, according to a report in The New York Times.
It is not as if advocates of reducing the corporate tax rate are ignorant of the impact of taxes on dividends in terms of the overall corporate tax burden. In 2003, they made much of the fact that taxes on dividends went as high as 39.6 percent, thus giving the United States a very high combined corporate tax rate. 
As President George W. Bush explained in a speech on Jan. 7, 2003:
We can begin by treating investors fairly and equally in our tax laws. As it is now, many investments are taxed not once but twice. First, the I.R.S. taxes a company on its profit. Then it taxes the investors who receive the profits as dividends. The result of this double taxation is that for all the profit a company earns, shareholders who receive dividends keep as little as 40 cents on the dollar....
It's fair to tax a company's profits. It's not fair to double tax by taxing the shareholder on the same profits. So today, for the good of our senior citizens and to support capital formation across the land, I'm asking the United States Congress to abolish the double taxation of dividends....
By ending this investment penalty, we will strengthen investor confidence. See, by ending double taxation of dividends, we will increase the return on investing, which will draw more money into the markets to provide capital to build factories, to buy equipment, hire more people.
In the end, even a Republican-controlled Congress balked at abolishing taxes on dividends, as President Bush demanded, and instead reduced the tax on dividends to a maximum of 15 percent, among the lowest rates in major countries.
Although one often hears conservatives say that cutting the corporate tax rate would jump-start growth, it's worth noting that the original Bush proposal to sharply reduce the combined corporate tax rate by abolishing taxes on dividends would have been likely to have only a very modest effect on growth. 
According to a report by the Council of Economic Advisers on Feb. 4, 2003, the original Bush tax package, which also included provisions intended to increase saving and investment, would have only raised the growth of real gross domestic product by 0.2 percent a year. 
An article in the December issue of the National Tax Journal finds that the long-run effect of cutting the corporate tax rate to 30 percent would have a similarly modest impact.
It is extremely simplistic to look only at the statutory corporate tax rate in evaluating the economic effects of the corporate tax. Many other factors must be taken into consideration.
And while it may be a good idea to reduce the corporate tax rate as part of a tax reform package, the idea that this will jump-start growth is nonsense.

HEADLINE: Councilman's Aide in a Santa Suit, Wearing a Punk-Rock Past

BYLINE: PATRICK WALL


HIGHLIGHT: Justin Brannan, a founding member of two noted hardcore bands, is making a very different name for himself in local politics. 

 BODY:
Santa had a few minutes to kill before a holiday party the other evening, so he pulled up his sleeves and showed off some of his tattoos: a dragon, a sailboat and, inked across the nape of his neck, the phrase, "Meat Is Murder."
The man in red, played by Justin Brannan, was sitting in the Brooklyn office of his boss, City Councilman Vincent J. Gentile, whose district includes Bay Ridge and Dyker Heights. Mr. Brannan, 33, is the councilman's director of communications and legislative affairs.
He also happens to be a former Wall Street back-office worker and a founding member of two world-touring hardcore punk bands.
"We have legions of screaming fans in Croatia," Mr. Brannan said recently. "Then I walk down Third Avenue, and no one knows who I am." 
Mr. Brannan was a sophomore at Xaverian High School, a Catholic boys' school in Bay Ridge, when he and some friends formed the hardcore band Indecision, with Mr. Brannan on chainsaw guitar. The group's raucous sound - think feral growls and machine-gun rhythms - and its radical politics soon elevated it from local bars to larger venues.
After Indecision dissolved, Mr. Brannan and other Indecision alums formed Most Precious Blood, which released three albums and toured six continents before going on indefinite hiatus in 2007.
Between tours, Mr. Brannan worked as a temporary employee for Wall Street banks and had a short-lived radio career, as an intern for "The Howard Stern Show," and a traffic reporter for WNEW-FM.
In 2007, he landed a job at the investment bank Bear Stearns, where he worked until the company imploded the next year.
After Bear Stearns, Mr. Brannan did consulting and fund-raising work for local nonprofit groups. His girlfriend, now fiancee, opened an after-school art program for children in a storefront on Third Avenue, the kind of business that might have seemed out of place a decade or two ago in famously conservative Bay Ridge but is now part of the neighborhood's changing face. And through all his connections, Mr. Brannan grew more active in local politics.
Michael Esposito, a former Indecision bandmate who now runs the Gold Coast Delicatessen, where Mr. Brannan was doing his Santa thing, said that his old friend has grown from "the king of prank phone calls" into one of the neighborhood's new crop of movers.
In the spring, Mr. Brannan was hired as Mr. Gentile's press aide. Compared with the past, when Mr. Brannan fretted about unruly mosh pits or the collapse of the world financial system, today he sweats over storm drains, senior centers and litter baskets.
He must also throw water on the occasional political flare-up, such as the news that the Campaign Finance Board fined Mr. Gentile nearly $27,000 for spending violations. (Mr. Brannan said that accounting errors were to blame.)
But Mr. Brannan's ambitions seem to extend beyond the councilman's office.
He is president of a newly formed political club, the Bay Ridge Democrats, which has already played host to some impressive guests, including the New York City comptroller, John Liu, and the public advocate, Bill de Blasio. Not surprisingly, Mr. Brannan's name has come up in conversations among some Democrats about possible candidates to challenge the Republican State Senator Martin J. Golden.
For now, Mr. Brannan said, he had no plans to run for office, though he has not ruled out the possibility down the line.
Any future campaigns will be complicated by Mr. Brannan's colorful past. Already, one conservative blog has called attention to a Most Precious Blood album, "Our Lady of Annihilation," whose cover features an image of the Virgin Mary with explosives strapped to her body. 
"That's something I'll probably have to pay a consultant millions of dollars to explain," said Mr. Brannan, who added that the image was meant to evoke "the lunacy of killing in the name of religion."
At the holiday party at Gold Coast, sponsored by the Merchants of Third Avenue Association (Mr. Brannan is a member), the old thrasher let out a hearty, "Ho, ho, ho!" to a flurry of camera flashes. Later, in his red suit and white beard, he grabbed a microphone and addressed the crowd.
"I just want to say," said the punk rock-politico Santa, "that Bay Ridge is my favorite place on Earth."

HEADLINE: Is Republican Infighting Helping Obama?

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Squabbling among Republicans on the campaign trail and on Capitol Hill may give President Obama a chance to regain his political footing. 

 BODY:
Has Republican squabbling given President Obama a chance to recover his political footing just as his re-election year begins? 
Deep divisions among Congressional Republicans have led to political gridlock on the extension of Mr. Obama's popular payroll tax cut, producing an issue that the president has been using to hammer his opponents as out of touch with middle-class Americans.
That legislative dispute is playing out against the backdrop of an increasingly nasty - and potentially drawn-out - Republican presidential primary, in which the attacks against Mr. Obama have temporarily faded into the background while the contenders assail one another.
And now, a new survey suggests that the view of Mr. Obama in the eyes of the general public has begun to improve just as he prepares to make the case for another term in the White House. A Washington Post-ABC poll on Monday put his approval rating at 49 percent, his best since the spring. 
And the poll suggests that the public's estimation of him has increased as its approval of Republicans in Congress has plummeted. Just 20 percent approved of Congressional Republicans. The poll also found that Mr. Obama holds a 15-point edge over Republicans in Congress on the question of who does a better job of protecting the middle class.
Mr. Obama still faces steep challenges, including a fragile economy with high unemployment that could yet go higher before Election Day next November. And the rhetorical honeymoon from the Republican presidential candidates will abruptly end as soon as they pick a nominee.
But in the meantime, aides to the president said they are pleased with the progress Mr. Obama has made in better communicating the contrast between himself and his Republican opponents.
"He has been very effective since the summer in consistently presenting his economic message, which speaks to the need, not just to recover from the recession, but to rebuild the economic security the middle class has lost," said David Axelrod, one of the president's top political advisers.
"And it's been a pretty stark contrast with what's going on on the other side," he noted.
Republicans in Congress have been trying to maneuver blame for the payroll tax on Mr. Obama by linking approval to an oil pipeline deal that the administration had delayed. But that tactic became more difficult after a deal was reached over the weekend with Senate Republicans. A two-month extension of the tax cut passed 89-10, one of the most bipartisan votes in recent memory.
On Monday night, House Republicans refused to accept the two-month deal embraced by their party colleagues in the Senate. Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies pounced, blaming conservatives in the House for standing in the way of a deal just days before Christmas.
Jay Carney, the president's press secretary, earlier in the day expressed dismay about a "situation where the things that have broad bipartisan support, have broad, broad American public support, cannot get done because a sub-faction of one party in one house basically dictating the direction of the majority in that house. It makes it very difficult."
House Republicans explained their opposition to the two-month deal as a desire to have a year-long extension of the tax cut. "House Republicans don't believe we should have to settle for tax policy in two-month increments," one senior aide said. "That's no way to govern, and it's no way to help our economy."
But even some Republican strategists said Monday night that party leaders in the House had put their members in a very difficult position.
"Democrats are clearly on the high ground of reasonableness here," Steve Schmidt, who helped run Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, said on MSNBC. "When you're in a rock-throwing fight, you always want to be on the side that's throwing the rocks downhill."
He added: "It's not a great fight for the Republicans."
If the legislative battles by Republicans are inadvertently raising Mr. Obama's political fortunes, the party's presidential nominating contest is not helping Republicans either.
At the first Republican debates held during the summer, most of the candidates on the stage reserved their most stinging rhetorical fire for Mr. Obama, calling him a failure and repeatedly questioning his ability to lead the country out of economic decline.
In the first debate in New Hampshire in June, Mr. Romney said flatly that "this president has failed." Newt Gingrich offered that "the Obama administration is an anti-jobs, anti-business, anti-America's energy industry."
Some of that language remains a staple of stump speeches. But as voting nears in Iowa in early January, Mr. Obama has become something of an afterthought. Instead, the candidates are focused on undermining each other - and national media coverage of the race is focused on the flaws that they are highlighting.
That leaves Mr. Obama - who does not have a primary to worry about - free to work on honing an effective message for the campaign next year.
Mr. Obama's political advisers said his improvement in the polls may be the result of a slowly improving economy, the Republican infighting and a better communication strategy. One adviser added: "The end of the Iraq war also was a noteworthy event."
But the people charged with getting Mr. Obama re-elected understand that political fortunes are fleeting, especially with a public that has demonstrated its frustration with the Washington political game.
The Republican divisions may be helping the president's poll numbers now. But what matters more is the situation next September, when the Republican Party has united around a nominee with just a couple of months before the election.
That's when Mr. Obama's advisers will know whether he has regained his footing.

HEADLINE: Wanted: A Ron Paul for Policing

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A study published on Monday in "Pediatrics" indicates that nearly one in three Americans will be arrested by age 23. 

 BODY:
I don't support Ron Paul and I can't imagine how his libertarian philosophy could possibly work, especially at a time when the crippled economy is crying out for effective government. But I appreciate the novelty he has brought to the Republican primaries, and the way he sometimes breaks with right-wing orthodoxy. When the other presidential aspirants compete to out-tough each other on foreign policy, for example, I think it's useful to have Mr. Paul jump in and say-as he did at the last debate-that the "greatest danger" is a president who "will overreact."
I bring this up because a couple of news stories I read recently have made me want to hear Ron Paul on criminal justice, or someone like him - someone who commands national attention, preferably on the right because that's more effective when it comes to law and order, who's willing to express concern about overreaction in policing.

A study published on Monday in "Pediatrics" (and reported widely) indicates that nearly one in three Americans will be arrested by age 23. A previous study, conducted 44 years ago, had put that figure at 22 percent. That's a depressing, but not exactly surprising, increase, which the authors attribute to a justice system that is more aggressive than it used to be. Local police departments pursue minor offenses, including drug violations, more vigorously than in the past. It's the broken windows theory run amok.
Law-and-order types might shrug off these findings, and point to the fact that violent crime rates have been declining steadily over the last 15 years. But even if rounding up kids has contributed to that trend, surely we need a better balance. If you've been arrested it's harder to get a job, or a loan - harder, that is, to function as an adult.
Although the "Pediatrics" study did not break down its findings by ethnicity, it is well-known that early contact with the criminal justice system is more common among some groups than others. On Sunday the Times ran a very moving op-ed by a 23-year-old black man, Nicholas K. Peart, who's been stopped on the streets of New York numerous times-first when he was celebrating his 18th birthday with friends in Manhattan, the second time when he was leaving his grandmother's home in Brooklyn. On each occasion he was stopped, frisked, searched, asked for his ID, and then let go. Mr. Peart notes that minorities in New York are disproportionately affected by the police department stop-and frisk policy: The N.Y.P.D. has recorded more than 600,000 stops, and 84 percent were of blacks or Latinos.-statistic that cannot be simply explained away by saying that more crimes take place in parts of the city with large black or Latino populations
At some point the price we pay for trying to keep communities safe-obviously an admirable goal in theory-becomes intolerably high. Mr. Paul has spoken out against federal legislation passed after the Sept. 11 attacks that reduce basic liberties in the name of national defense; overly-aggressive policing in the name of local defense has the same effect.

HEADLINE: As City Closes In on 50 Millionth Visitor, British Couple to Be Feted

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Tourism officials are honoring Craig Johnson and Lucy Foulger, both of England, as the honorary 50 millionth visitors because the United Kingdom was the No. 1 source of foreign visitors to the city. 

 BODY:
Spending an hour or so with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in Times Square was not part of the plan that Craig Johnson and Lucy Foulger had laid out for their wedding day.
But that was before New York officials decided to crown the British couple the honorary 50 millionth visitors to the city this year. At noon on Tuesday, less than an hour after they were scheduled to be married in Rockefeller Center, Mr. Johnson and Ms. Foulger were expected to be the guests of honor at a news conference in the oh-so-romantic, pulsing heart of Manhattan.
Mr. Bloomberg is expected to announce that the city has drawn a record number of tourists this year and is just days away from cracking the 50 million mark. The staff of the city's tourism marketing arm, NYC & Company, was forecasting that the target would be met within a day or two of Christmas.
Promoting the city's attraction in overseas markets has been one of Mr. Bloomberg's priorities because foreigners tend to spend more in the city's hotels, restaurants, museums and stores than the typical domestic tourist does. His office estimates that visitors will spend $32 billion in the city this year and that that spending will spur an additional $16 billion in economic activity as people who work in tourism-related businesses spend the money they take in.
For agreeing to merge their special day with one of the mayor's, the couple will be rewarded handsomely: They have been offered a bundle of prizes - mostly in the form of gift cards and tickets to shows - with a face value of considerably more than $25,000. 
Among the merchants that contributed to the bounty were American Express, Travelocity, Bloomingdale's, F.A.O. Schwarz and the Tribeca Grill restaurant. NYC & Company, which derives its revenue from its corporate members and from allocations of city money, has agreed to pay any taxes the couple incur on the prizes, but is not assuming the costs of their trip or the wedding, a city official said.
Tourism officials settled on honoring a family from England because the United Kingdom was the No. 1 source of foreign visitors to the city. They chose Mr. Johnson and Ms. Foulger largely because of their history with the city: The couple first visited New York 10 years ago, just before 9/11, and stayed in the Millennium Hotel near the World Trade Center. 
They were already planning to bring a group of friends and relatives, including their two young children, to New York this week when they were invited to be saluted by the mayor, surrounded by thousands of other tourists from around the world in the pedestrian plaza that never goes dark.

HEADLINE: Perry Dismisses Gingrich's Complaint of 'Negative' Campaigning

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Perry indicated that he had no plans to stop drawing contrasts in the final two weeks before the Iowa caucuses. 

 BODY:
DE WITT, Iowa - Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said Tuesday that he was not concerned by a complaint from a Republican rival, Newt Gingrich, that the tenor of the presidential primary race had grown too negative and indicated that he had no plans to stop drawing contrasts in the final two weeks before the Iowa caucuses.
"As long as no one is misstating the facts, I don't consider that to be negative," Mr. Perry said. "It's always in the eye of the beholder."
For weeks, Mr. Perry's advertisements have dominated the television and radio airwaves in Iowa. He has spent more money here than any other Republican candidate. Some of his ads have drawn sharp distinctions with Mr. Gingrich and another rival, Mitt Romney.
"If someone is saying something that's truthful - even though one person might consider it negative - I don't get concerned that it's doing anything other than expressing the truth of the matter," Mr. Perry said, stopping for a moment after shaking hands in the downtown business district of this eastern Iowa town shortly after lunchtime. 
As he took questions from reporters, Mr. Perry said he believed that his campaign was gaining strength in Iowa. He said he looked forward to a debate over the economy and foreign policy with President Obama. A freelance photographer and writer from Chicago, who was in the group of reporters, asked Mr. Perry how he could compete with Mr. Obama's foreign policy credentials, including the killing of Osama bin Laden.
"I would suggest to you that it was Navy Seals and our intelligence community that was the reason that Bin Laden was taken out," Mr. Perry said, "not the president of the United States."
With two weeks remaining before the Iowa caucuses open the Republican nominating contest, Mr. Perry has encountered several undecided voters on his bus tour of the state. He has tried to make his case, promoting himself as the outsider in the race. He urged Republican voters to take a careful look at his rivals.
"Newt's been on the inside," Mr. Perry said Tuesday. "He's practically the grandfather of earmarks."
In his television ads and in fliers landing in the mailboxes of voters here, Mr. Perry has criticized Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Romney for their previous support of health care mandates.
"Do you want an insider, whether it's Wall Street or Washington?" Mr. Perry said. "Or do you want an outsider like myself?"

HEADLINE: A Rhetorical Return for 'YOYO' Economics

BYLINE: HELENE COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: A phrase coined in 2006 bounces back into the discourse of a presidential election year. 

 BODY:
Just in time for the presidential campaign season, "you're on your own" economics -- a k a YOYO -- has returned to the rhetorical landscape.
YOYO economics, a term coined by the economist Jared Bernstein in his 2006 book "All Together Now: Common Sense for a Fair Economy," is meant to refer - critically, of course - to the idea that many Republican economic proposals simply shift risk from the government and big corporations to individuals and families.
Acronym alert: In his book, Mr. Bernstein also offered up WITT - "we're in this together" -- as the counter to YOYO.
Democrats really liked the two phrases, and they showed up in a number of places. Mr. Bernstein said that when he was working at the White House as economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., he "certainly waxed critically about YOYO economics," although he wasn't sure if President Obama ever saw his book.
Whether the president did or not, he has now taken up the task of criticizing YOYO. During a recent speech in Kansas -- one that Mr. Obama has told aides he considers one of his most important as president -- he sharply criticized the idea of trickle-down economics, saying: "It doesn't work. It's never worked."
"We simply cannot return to this brand of 'you're on your own' economics if we're serious about rebuilding the middle class in this country," Mr. Obama said. "We know that it doesn't result in a strong economy. It results in an economy that invests too little in its people and its future. It doesn't result in a prosperity that trickles down; it results in a prosperity that's enjoyed by fewer and fewer of our citizens."
Mr. Obama isn't the only one to invoke YOYO recently.
In his new book, "Back to Work," Bill Clinton writes: "Over the last 30 years, this 'financialization' of the American economy, combined with the anti-government tax cuts, weaker oversight of everything from banks to polluters, and, in the last decade, lax enforcement of our trade agreements has created a 'you're on your own' economic and social policy that is the bedrock of anti-government governance."
And then, he moved swiftly to WITT, writing, "We need to get back to a 'we're in this together' mind-set."

HEADLINE: Explaining Obama's Approval Rating Bounce

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: One popular theory is that the president is benefiting from the battle over the payroll tax cut with Congress, but it seems more likely that an improving economy is making Americans less pessimistic. 

 BODY:
President Obama has seen improved approval ratings in the past few weeks. His approval rating in the average of six polls tracked by Real Clear Politics now stands at 46.5 percent. That's the highest the figure has been since July, and is up from a low of about 42 percent in early October.
The improvement in Mr. Obama's numbers, while fairly modest, is potentially meaningful. A relatively simple analysis of historical data that I conducted earlier this year found that an approval rating of 46 or 47 percent has represented the rough break-even point at which presidents are equally likely to win or lose a second term. Re-election becomes unlikely but not impossible if the president is below this mark -- the quality of his opponent and the presence of third-party candidates can alter the outcome -- and probable but not certain if it is closer to 50 percent. (Note, however, that Mr. Obama's disapproval ratings still exceed his approval ratings in most polls, which may be the better benchmark.)
But what is driving the change? One popular theory is that Mr. Obama is benefiting from the confrontation with Congress over the payroll tax cut:
A CNN/ORC International Poll out Tuesday also indicates that the partisan battle over extending the payroll tax cut may be partially responsible for the jump in the president's numbers.
I would suggest that another explanation is much more plausible: Mr. Obama's improved approval ratings reflect rising economic expectations.

The American economy is by no means in good shape -- not when 13.3 million Americans remain out of work, even by the insufficiently inclusive definition that the Bureau of Labor Statistics prefers. However, there have been some promising signs.
The White House got a good headline number in this month's unemployment report, with the unemployment rate dropping to 8.6 percent from 9 percent. Although the details of the report were not as strong, the findings have been bolstered by a steady decline in the number of initial claims for unemployment insurance, which are at their lowest levels since 2008. Meanwhile, housing starts are up, retail sales figures have been reasonably good, and various regional and national manufacturing indexes are generally coming in above expectations.
Perhaps more important from the White House's perspective, there are clear signs that Americans are becoming less pessimistic about the economy's performance. Gallup's daily tracking of economic confidence has shown it rebounding to the point it was at before the debt ceiling debates of July and August, which had scared Main Street and Wall Street alike. The two major monthly consumer confidence surveys, from the Conference Board and the University of Michigan, have also shown improvement.
Again, this is not to suggest that these numbers are actually good. But they seem to have returned to a sort of equilibrium that they've been at for much of the last two years.
Likewise, having an approval rating of about 46 or 47 percent is familiar territory for Mr. Obama. His approval ratings have generally been in that range since January 2010, with the exceptions of rally-around-the-flag bounces following the attempted assassination of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and the killing of Osama bin Laden, and what now looks to have been a temporary dip after the debt ceiling debacle.
I am not an economic determinist who says economic numbers are the only thing that matters; the relationships are more tenuous than that. However, my view is that the economy deserves the "right of first refusal." If you can explain a change in approval ratings based on economic attitudes -- and I think you can in this case -- this will usually be necessary and sufficient.
By contrast, I find it unlikely that Mr. Obama's approval ratings are improving because he is being compared favorably to Congress. Voters can judge each branch of government on its own terms. After the debt ceiling debate, they were perfectly happy to cast a pox upon all houses, with both Mr. Obama's and Congress's approval ratings sliding.
This debate over interpreting Mr. Obama's approval ratings has some implications for the current argument in Congress over the payroll tax cut. If you believe that his improved ratings reflect his outmaneuvering Congress, then perhaps it is to his benefit if the argument extends on past the new year. But if you believe instead that the ratings have more to do with improved economic confidence, this could be a dangerous game. Even if the tax cuts are eventually extended, as seems likely, a temporary decline in Americans' take-home pay in January would nevertheless represent a disruptive influence at the very moment that Americans are starting to believe in the economy again.
Rising economic expectations also represent a mixed blessing for the White House over the longer term. To be sure, the White House would rather see these numbers rise than fall. It should be encouraging to Mr. Obama that voters now seem inclined to take a "wait and see" approach on him, rather than simply giving up on his leadership, as had seemed possible during the summer. But the economy still faces significant headwinds, most notably from Europe as well as from the ongoing process of deleveraging after the financial crisis. The consensus of economists in the Wall Street Journal forecasting panel are predicting G.D.P. growth of just 2.3 percent next year. Although these forecasts are often wildly inaccurate, the odds are against Mr. Obama benefiting from the robust growth that helped Bill Clinton win re-election in 1996 or Ronald Reagan in 1984, and it would not take all that much to tip the economy back into recession.

HEADLINE: Romney Reworks Stump Speech, but Keeps Focus on Obama

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER and MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney cast President Obama as a president turning away from American exceptionalism, and giving up on the mission of making the country better. 

 BODY:
BEDFORD, N.H. - Mitt Romney drew some of the sharpest and harshest distinctions yet between himself and President Obama on Tuesday night, painting the upcoming election as a choice between "two destinies" - his vision of a capitalist society based on merit and enterprise, versus what he called the president's embrace of entitlement programs and an intent "to use the invisible boot of government to bring us all down." 
Turning President John F. Kennedy's famous call to action on its head, Mr. Romney declared that President Obama was now asking Americans: "What can the country do for you?"
And seeking to co-opt Mr. Obama's message of hope from 2008, he declared that "we will not surrender our dreams to the failures of this president."
Mr. Romney presented a new and updated version of his stump speech here the night before he was set to kick off a three-day, nine-town bus tour through the state. 
He warned of a president turning away from American exceptionalism, and giving up on the mission of making the country better.
"I am tired of a president who wakes up every day, looks out across America and is proud to announce, 'It could be worse.'"
"It could be worse?" Mr. Romney asked. "Is that what it means to be an American? It could be worse?"
Describing his philosophy, he said, "I have a vision of a very different America, an America united not by our limits but by our ambitions, our hopes and our shared dreams," Mr. Romney said.
The speech was carefully crafted, with Mr. Romney and his staff working up until Tuesday to smooth it out. He delivered it under special overhead lights and the help of two teleprompters, and four cameras from his campaign filmed the scene (expect an ad coming soon to a New Hampshire media market near you) as a coterie of his aides watched from the back. 
Mr. Romney did not mention any of his Republican rivals in the speech, keeping his focus entirely on Mr. Obama, and portraying the November election as a fight over more than just policy and deficit reduction differences.
"The battle we face today is more than a fight over our budget," he said. "It's a battle for America's soul."
Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for Mr. Obama's re-election campaign, said in an e-mail statement that he was surprised Mr. Romney was able to deliver his speech "with a straight face."
"Governor Romney claims to want to level the playing field to create opportunity, but all his policies do is stack the deck against the middle class," he wrote. "He has repackaged the same policies that caused the economic crisis and led to the insecurity middle class families have been facing. The president is fighting to build an economy where hard work and responsibility are rewarded, everyone plays by the same rules whether on Wall Street or Main Street and economic security for the middle class is restored."

HEADLINE: Vander Plaats Endorses Santorum

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Rick Santorum wins a highly coveted endorsement from one of the state's social conservative leaders. 

 BODY:
DE WITT, Iowa - Rick Santorum, who was the first Republican presidential hopeful to visit all 99 Iowa counties in a quest to gain traction for the party's nomination, received a lift on Tuesday by collecting a highly coveted endorsement from Bob Vander Plaats, one of the most visible leaders of the Christian conservative movement.
Two weeks before the Iowa caucuses open the Republican nominating contest, many of the state's evangelical voters have yet to unify behind one candidate. Tensions among influential groups have split the support of Christian conservatives, but Mr. Vander Plaats urged party activists to support Mr. Santorum.
"It just shows that we're the candidate the folks see as on the way up," Mr. Santorum said after learning of the endorsement. "We're the candidate right now that has the momentum, that has the message that is resonating to the people of Iowa, and I think they are probably catching that."
Mr. Vander Plaats, who has sought to put his imprint on the Republican presidential race, and other evangelical leaders have talked openly about their difficulty in choosing a candidate. For weeks, Mr. Vander Plaats has made supportive statements about Newt Gingrich, which touched off a storm of criticism among social conservatives here. 
As he made his announcement on Tuesday, Mr. Vander Plaats did not stop with only an endorsement. He urged other socially conservative candidates to consider dropping out of the race and extending their support to Mr. Santorum, so he "could quickly vault into first place and win the nomination."
That suggestion was dismissed by campaign advisers to rival candidates.
For Mr. Santorum, the backing of Mr. Vander Plaats and Chuck Hurley, another prominent conservative leader, the endorsement comes at a critical time. He is trying to persuade Republican voters in Iowa to give his candidacy a second look, hoping that a stronger than expected finish could help him break through.
"He could be the Huckabee in this race," Mr. Vander Plaats told reporters, referring to former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2008.
At this late stage in the campaign, it remains an open question how the endorsement from Mr. Vander Plaats will affect the race. His political activity, including leading the effort to remove three judges from the Iowa Supreme Court last year in a battle over same-sex marriage, has made him a lightning rod in some Republican circles.
The Family Leader, a conservative group that Mr. Vander Plaats formed after losing a bid for the Republican nomination for Iowa governor last year, narrowed its choices last month to Mr. Santorum, Gov.Rick Perry of Texas, Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Mr. Gingrich.
The board of directors of the Family Leader announced Tuesday that they would formally remain neutral in the race because of divided loyalties among candidates. Mr. Vander Plaats and Mr. Hurley said their endorsements were personal and were not made as representatives of their organizations.
Mr. Perry, Mr. Gingrich and Mrs. Bachmann had aggressively courted the socially conservative leaders, hoping that an endorsement would provide a burst of momentum in the closing weeks of the contest here. As his campaign bus rolled through eastern Iowa on Tuesday, Mr. Perry reminded reporters that the Family Leader group remained neutral.
"You've got a number of really serious conservatives in the race, both social and fiscal conservatives," Mr. Perry said, noting Mr. Santorum and Mrs. Bachmann by name. "I was not surprised at all that they stayed neutral, but you'd always love to get good endorsements like that."
While social conservatives have held an outsize influence in previous campaigns here, polls show that the economy is the overriding issue for all Republicans who plan to attend the caucuses on Jan. 3. By failing to coalesce around a single candidate, Republicans here say the weight of evangelical voters could be diminished.

To the Editor:
Re ''As Permafrost Thaws, Scientists Study the Risks'' (''Temperature Rising'' series, front page, Dec. 17) and ''Beyond Durban'' (editorial, Dec. 17):
It is clearly time for the human race to make radical moves to save the livability of our only planet home. We in the United States are unlikely to persuade China and India to forgo huge rises in emissions unless we agree to limit or even stop our own advances in living standards, as well as make big reductions in per capita emissions. 
Economic growth in the United States has meant bigger cars, bigger houses and more gadgets, all of which we could do without. We could regain and maintain a reasonably healthy employment picture with little or no growth by essentially sharing jobs, a sharing effectuated by decreases in working hours in step with productivity advances.
Adopting such a regime would be politically difficult, perhaps impossible. But you never know unless you try, and the suffering that failure would bring would be incalculable. Surely even the leaders of the oil industry have grandchildren they care about.
BARBARA R. BERGMANN Washington, Dec. 17, 2011
The writer is professor emerita of economics at the University of Maryland and American University.
To the Editor:
You blame everyone except the United States for the scandalously inadequate world climate talks in Durban, South Africa (editorial, Dec. 17). It is we who have refused to ''play by the same rules as everyone else,'' from the United States' refusal to ratify the Kyoto treaty to this administration's refusal at Durban to accept binding limits before the end of the decade.
Borrowing a Republican talking point, you deflect attention to India and China. American carbon dioxide emissions rose 4 percent in 2010. Our pollution per capita is still far higher than China's or India's. Moreover, rich countries have the lion's share of cumulative emissions.
Scientists warn that humanity must -- and can -- cut emissions by 2020 to avoid a tipping point where warming creates more warming. President Obama must return with conviction to his earlier but indecisive effort to use the economic crisis as an opportunity to transform the American economy. Only this time, rather than cutting deals with corporate polluters, he -- and we -- must confront the pollution of politics by money.
DAVID KEPPEL Bloomington, Ind., Dec. 17, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''Environmentalists Get Down to Earth'' (news analysis, Sunday Review, Dec. 18):
It would be hard to find ''a tougher moment over the last 40 years to be a leader in the American environmental movement'' only if your sole focus is the national debate. All the rest of us -- at the local, state and regional levels -- have known for years what the nationals are only now realizing: we've got to engage people closer to where they live.
That's also where we'll make positive changes on energy and other big issues. The article cites good examples: coal plants, fracking and clean water. Progress on those issues is not happening in Congress. In state and regional arenas, it is.
For those of us who have worked there these last 40 years, the time for our earthbound experience, savvy and skills has arrived. It's actually a great time to be in the environmental movement. We're pleased to welcome national organizations to the action.

HEADLINE: Fresh From a Fisherman's Small Boat, a Stew

BYLINE: By DAVID TANIS

 BODY:
A JOLLY fishmonger is an inspiration. Alex Villani, well known to Greenmarket shoppers in Manhattan and Brooklyn, is just that: smiling, laughing, joking and incredibly hard-working.
''It's hard work but it's fun,'' he said. Rising well before dawn to make the long drive from Mattituck on eastern Long Island, his truck loaded with fresh-caught fish and shellfish, he and his wife, Stephanie, set up their Blue Moon Fish stand at several markets each week. Their customers are loyal, and everything usually sells out early.
Mr. Villani mostly fishes solo in his small boat. Most of his days are spent in watery solitude, far from the bustling city, so perhaps this accounts for his sunny disposition on land. But one suspects he is just a happy man regardless. 
Sales are brisk and the line moves quickly. ''Got any herring?'' asked an older gent who wanted to pickle some to satisfy a memory from childhood. ''Alex, you get my e-mail about the oysters for my party?'' The requests kept coming. A pound of bay scallops. Pound and a half of scrod. Three swordfish steaks.
The blackboard announces what is for sale today: skate, flounder, hake, blackfish (tautog), cod, clams, mussels, squid, sea bass, striped bass, monkfish, razor clams, swordfish. You can buy whole fish or fillets, and fish heads are free for the asking. There is also a variety of cured and smoked fish products and sometimes smoked eel.
For nearly 25 years the Villanis have maintained a tradition of braving the elements and staying open until Christmas Eve, before taking a well-deserved hiatus during the coldest months of the year. That way their customers can be assured of the opportunity to make a seven-fish Italian feast, should they be so inclined. Or, like Mr. Villani, they can just relax with a pile of raw oysters. ''But don't dawdle, I'm closing at 11:30, maybe noon,'' he said.
Looking over the spanking-fresh assortment, I want to buy everything. Finally I choose a few ingredients for a hearty fish and shellfish stew, good for a chilly winter evening. It will veer Mediterranean, with a base of leeks and onions, a bit of tomato, potatoes, saffron and garlic.
It is a pleasure to buy fish right from the source, from a smiling fisherman, no less. And buying from a small-boat operation means getting sustainably caught fish, as well as supporting a local economy. Which is also something to smile about.
Recipe: Fishmonger's Stew
Time: 45 minutes
1 dozen medium-small clams, like littlenecks
1 pound mussels
3/4 pound monkfish or other firm-fleshed white fish, in 1-inch cubes
3/4 pound scrod, flounder, or other soft-fleshed white fish, in 1-inch cubes
3/4 pound squid, in 1/2-inch rings, plus tentacles
1/2 pound bay scallops, optional
Salt and pepper
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups medium-diced onions
3 cups medium-diced leeks, rinsed of grit
1/2 cup diced canned tomato
2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves, or a few thyme sprigs
1 bay leaf
Pinch of saffron, about 1/8 teaspoon
4 garlic cloves, chopped
1 teaspoon paprika
Pinch red pepper flakes
6 cups fish stock, chicken broth, or water
1 pound Yellow Finn or russet potatoes, peeled, in 1/2-inch slices
Garlic-saffron sauce, see recipe.
1. Soak the clams in cold water to remove grit and sand, then drain. Rinse and de-beard the mussels. Put the monkfish, scrod, squid and bay scallops (if using) in separate small bowls. Season the fish lightly with salt and pepper.
2. Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed soup pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions and leeks and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato, thyme, bay leaf, saffron, garlic, paprika and red pepper flakes. Season generously with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, for another 5 minutes.
3. Turn the heat to high, add the fish stock, chicken broth or water, and bring to a boil. Taste for salt and adjust to taste. Add the potatoes and reduce the heat so they simmer gently until firm-tender, about 10 minutes. (The stew may be prepared to this point up to 2 hours ahead.)
4. To finish the stew, return the heat to a brisk simmer. Add the clams and cook till they open, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the mussels, monkfish and scrod and simmer until the mussels open, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the squid and scallops, if using, and cook 1 minute more. Turn off the heat, stir in the garlic-saffron sauce.
Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
Recipe: Garlic-Saffron Sauce
Time: 10 minutes
1 cup crustless day-old French bread, in 1/2-inch cubes
2 or 3 garlic cloves
Salt
Pinch of saffron, about 1/8 teaspoon
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped parsley.
1. Soak the bread in cold water for 1 minute and squeeze dry. Mash garlic and salt into a paste. Put it in a mortar with the bread and pound together with the saffron, or mix it all in a blender.
2. Gradually whisk in the olive oil to make a thick sauce. Add the lemon juice, parsley and salt. Keep the sauce at room temperature.
Yield: 1/3 cup.

HEADLINE: Living With Multiple Sclerosis, and Separated From the World by a Stairway

BYLINE: By MATHEW R. WARREN

 BODY:
Twenty-one steps keep Diane Kessler a virtual prisoner in her home.
Ms. Kessler, who learned she had multiple sclerosis in 1991, can no longer make her way down from her second-floor apartment in Elmsford, N.Y., on her own. To go anywhere, she must depend on her son or a network of neighbors to carry her.
''I don't say 'Why me?'; I don't look at it that way,'' Ms. Kessler, 54, said. ''I don't have a lot of energy and my legs get weak, but my arms are pretty strong, thank God.''
Though Ms. Kessler uses an electric scooter most of the time, she tries to walk on level ground as much as possible with the aid of her arms. On a recent afternoon in her apartment, in Westchester County, she demonstrated her technique. Propping up her thin frame against the kitchen counter, she took a step and grabbed onto a wall, then swung her other leg around, placed her weight on a chair and took another step, reaching her scooter. 
''I try to do as much as I can because, psychologically, it's good for the head,'' Ms. Kessler, a New York City native, said in an accent that revealed her Brooklyn upbringing.
While the trip down the stairs that run alongside her two-story building has become too dangerous for her alone, she can still make the trip up, pulling herself along the railing -- a feat that can take up to half an hour.
''Sometimes I wish I could just stand up and walk and do everything,'' she said. ''I try, I really do.''
Ms. Kessler lives with her 34-year-old son, and aside from trips to the doctor or the grocery store, she spends most of her time in her home, watching television and playing with their 11-year-old cat, T.C. (Too Cute), and 3-year-old golden brown pit bull, King.
In recent years, Ms. Kessler has developed a special relationship with King, battling him in tugs of war and exercising her arms in the process.
''He's very comforting,'' she said. ''I talk to him when I'm upset. I tell him everything. Some things you don't tell people, even your closest friends.''
Ms. Kessler, who until 1997 worked as an accounts-payable secretary for a wholesale food distributor, is not one to complain, but she admits to missing one thing that the disease has taken from her.
''I miss my heels,'' she said, referring to her shoes. ''When you have M.S., you don't feel like a woman.''
Still, she said, she does what she can. It takes her two and a half hours to fashion her neatly plucked eyebrows, using one hand to hold the other to control the shaking. She also trims and feathers her own bangs. She can afford to go to the beauty parlor only once or twice a year, she said.
Ms. Kessler receives $547 a month in Social Security disability benefits and $1,500 in alimony from an ex-husband, but that will end in December 2012, she said. The rent for her two-bedroom apartment is $1,326 a month. Her son is currently unemployed.
Medicare pays for some of the costs of her medications, but not all. When she was struggling to pay her bills, Ms. Kessler turned to Westchester Jewish Community Services, a beneficiary of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. In July, WJCS drew $450 from the fund to help Ms. Kessler pay outstanding phone and electric bills, and to fill a prescription.
She will become eligible for Medicaid once her alimony runs out next year, she said, and she is working on other housing options.
''What's somebody like her doing living in a place like this?'' a neighbor, Steve Beemer, asked recently, standing atop the steep set of stairs that leads to Ms. Kessler's door. Mr. Beemer, 62, a glass cutter, is one of those who carry Ms. Kessler down the steps.
''She doesn't weigh anything,'' he said, scooping her up in his arms as they both laughed. ''She's a sack of potatoes.''
Ms. Kessler, settling onto her scooter, said she hoped one day to have her own little place, ''with a backyard.''

HEADLINE: A Fight to Make Banks More Prudent

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- For Philipp M. Hildebrand, it was a reminder of what happens when you get between bankers and their bonuses.
Mr. Hildebrand, the president of the Swiss central bank, was called ''arrogant'' and ''egotistical'' by bankers quoted anonymously in the pages of Swiss newspapers. His supposed sin: Wanting banks to hold extra capital. The fact that Mr. Hildebrand was himself a former hedge fund manager in New York seemed only to heighten the sense that he had betrayed his profession.
''He'll never find another job in Switzerland,'' the Swiss newspaper Der Sonntag quoted an unnamed high-ranking banker as threatening Mr. Hildebrand in 2010.
The unusually bitter attacks on a central bank chief were a measure of what was at stake. Mr. Hildebrand, 48, had a high-visibility role in a struggle between bankers trying to preserve their most lucrative business practices and regulators trying to defuse a system that, many believe, nearly blew up the world economy. 
''Many of us on the public side had to deal with industry push-back, at times amplified by public coverage,'' Mr. Hildebrand said. ''One lesson that emerges is that the capacity of the financial industry to lobby for its short-term interests is far reaching.''
The debate centers on an international accord that most people outside the industry have never heard of, the so-called Basel III rules. The core issue and main point of dispute is capital -- the money that banks accumulate through issuing stock and holding onto profits, money that they do not have to repay. The regulators want banks to finance their operations with more capital and less borrowed money. Advocates argue that the bigger the capital buffer, the greater the stability of the financial system. But financing operations from capital, rather than borrowing money, is less profitable, and that means lower bonuses.
''In the financial crisis the banks got the upside and the public got the downside,'' said Stephen G. Cecchetti, head of the monetary and economic department of the Bank for International Settlements, in Basel, Switzerland. The bank houses the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the secretive panel that establishes global banking standards. ''We want to make sure that doesn't happen again.''
After some fierce battles, proponents of the tighter rules have achieved some success in pushing through measures that will force banks to reduce risk. The Federal Reserve on Tuesday published draft regulations that draw heavily on the agreements reached in Basel. But there is a long phase-in period that the banking industry could use to try to water down the rules. And many economists fear that the new regulatory regime still allows banks to take outsize risks.
Flaws in earlier Basel rules, known as Basel II, allowed the financial crisis to gather in the first place, many economists say, enabling the illusion that banks were comfortably cushioned against risk. In fact, the banks had badly underestimated the malignant potential of their holdings. Faulty regulation also worsened the European sovereign debt crisis, assigning government bonds virtually zero risk. That encouraged banks to extend billions in credit to countries like Greece and Italy, setting up a dangerous correlation between the solvency of countries and the health of banks. The thinking, in effect, was ''Why imprison capital to insure against losses that were unlikely ever to happen?''
The technical term was ''risk weighted assets.'' It was as if a homeowner only had to make a down payment on the part of a house that might catch fire. Other parts of the property, like the swimming pool and the lawn, would not count.
The flaws in this model became obvious in the days after investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008. Banks that appeared to be well capitalized discovered that they had hugely underestimated risk. Derivatives tied to the United States real estate market, with top credit ratings, suddenly became impossible to sell and effectively worthless.
One of the most vivid examples was right around the corner from Mr. Hildebrand's office in Zurich, the Swiss bank UBS. In the years before the crisis, UBS was, on paper, one of the best capitalized banks in the world. But in the course of 2008 UBS rapidly depleted its cushion as it absorbed losses from investments in the American real estate market.
On paper the risk-weighted assets of UBS -- the total of all the money it had at risk -- were 374 billion Swiss francs (about $400 billion in today's dollars) at the end of 2007. But that was an adjusted figure based on the bank's overly optimistic estimate of the amount at risk.
Gross assets, counting everything without adjusting for perceived risk, were much larger: 3.3 trillion Swiss francs. Measured against these total assets, UBS capital was well below 2 percent.
In October 2008, the Swiss National Bank, where Mr. Hildebrand was then vice president, was forced to commit $60 billion to rescue UBS.
In response, Mr. Hildebrand as well as top officials in the United States and Britain began trying to revive an old-fashioned idea, the so-called leverage ratio, as an extra layer of insurance in addition to tougher capital requirements for risk-weighted assets.
The aim was to set a minimum level of capital to be held against gross assets, regardless of estimated risk, to restrain the banks' strong incentive to make optimistic assumptions and supercharge leverage.
Banks considered the leverage ratio a blunt tool, an insult to all the investments they had made in the last decade to create sophisticated risk management systems, as well as a threat to potential profits and payouts to top bankers.
A few months before Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, when UBS was already in trouble and Swiss regulators proposed a leverage ratio as part of a package of new capital rules, ''the reaction was that we were completely crazy,'' said Daniel Zuberbuhler, vice chairman of the board of the Swiss financial regulator, known as Finma.
After Lehman, the mood swung sharply. ''My impression was that at the highest political level there was pretty close to a global consensus that things needed to change,'' said Stefan Ingves, governor of Sweden's central bank, who has been chairman of the Basel Committee since June.
But there was powerful resistance from organizations like the Washington-based Institute of International Finance, whose membership includes most of the world's largest banks.
Industry groups lobbied their national representatives on the Basel Committee furiously, to some effect. In countries like Germany and France, bankers helped convince top officials that differences in accounting standards effectively required European banks to hold more capital than their counterparts in the United States, putting them at a disadvantage.
The debate peaked in mid-2010, as the European sovereign debt crisis was emerging as a threat to the survival of the euro. In July of that year, the heads of central banks and top regulatory officials, who oversee the work of the Basel Committee, met to try to sign off on an agreement that would be approved by the Group of 20 leaders.
It was, Mr. Hildebrand and other participants agree, a difficult meeting. More than 50 representatives of 27 countries sat around a large elliptical table in a conference room at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel. Jean-Claude Trichet, then president of the European Central Bank, served as chairman.
According to several participants, the debate frequently became emotional, and it looked as if the meeting could break up without reaching an agreement, leaving the global financial system as vulnerable as before.
Mr. Trichet reminded the participants that it was up to them to prevent another financial crisis. The Western democracies, he warned darkly, could not survive another.
And he used a simple pressure tactic. The meeting began in the morning, with only beverages like coffee and water for sustenance. At lunchtime, employees set up a buffet lunch, but Mr. Trichet refused to adjourn.
The meeting dragged on until late afternoon. Finally, the exhausted and hungry delegates agreed on a compromise. It included a leverage ratio of 3 percent of assets, as well as several other provisions advocated by the Swiss, British and Americans but opposed by the banks. But the leverage ratio would not be fully enforced until 2018, to give banks plenty of time to raise more capital.
Soon after, the leaders of the G-20 nations endorsed the proposals. But that is hardly the end of the story. The rules are simply a benchmark, and it is up to individual nations to enshrine them in local law.
The Institute of International Finance has published studies maintaining that the Basel rules will force banks to substantially curtail lending and undercut economic growth. One study predicted that the Basel III rules would cost seven million jobs. Many economists counter that such studies ignore the huge cost to society of financial crises.
Mr. Cecchetti, of the Bank for International Settlements, called the Institute of International Finance forecasts ''completely outside historical experience.''
Will Basel III make the world a safer place?
Many economists worry that the leverage ratio, at just 3 percent, is much too low. Banks can still borrow $32 for every dollar they hold in capital.
In Switzerland, Mr. Hildebrand pushed for local rules that would be more rigorous than the Basel rules. It was this push that inspired so much bile from the banks in 2010.
But circumstances were on Mr. Hildebrand's side. As Swiss legislators were debating the proposals earlier this year, UBS disclosed that a 31-year-old employee had caused losses of $2.3 billion by making unauthorized trades.
Afterward, it was harder for banks to argue they had learned the lessons of the crisis. The law passed.

HEADLINE: Carnival Cruise Campaign Focuses on the First-Timers

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
A NEW television commercial for Carnival Cruise Lines opens with a couple looking over the railing of a cruise ship.
''Ah,'' says the man, ''so much better than last year.''
Suddenly the commercial cuts to a flashback, first to the same man screaming in the driver's seat of a vehicle, then to the woman in the passenger seat, also screaming, and kicking the dashboard. An exterior shot reveals that the couple is in a vehicle at a campsite, where a bear and a lion are on their hind legs pawing at the vehicle.
''Throw the food out the window!'' the man screams, as the bear roars. 
Cut to the ship, where the woman takes a bite of a chocolate covered strawberry and says, ''Never again.''
The commercial closes with a voiceover: ''How about a change of scenery this year? Get aboard a Carnival cruise and get more fun for all.''
Scheduled to be introduced on Dec. 26, the campaign is by Arnold Worldwide in Boston, part of Havas, and also includes print, outdoor and online advertising.
About a dozen humorous ads in what the brand calls the ''land versus sea'' campaign follow a similar format: calm moments on a cruise ship bookend a flashback of a fiasco from an earlier vacation. In one, a family is upside down on a stalled roller coaster; in another, a young man and woman visit his uncle, who hugs the woman inappropriately.
The campaign is directed at ''cruise rookies,'' or the 76 percent of the American population (according to Cruise Lines International Association data) who have never taken a cruise, said James Berra, chief marketing officer of Carnival.
By depicting ''elements of land vacations where you're making trade-offs,'' the new commercials get consumers to ''reappraise the category and think directly about Carnival,'' Mr. Berra said.
For those who have never booked a cruise, the primary deal-breaker is the cost, with 33 percent considering the base rate too expensive and an additional 26 percent fearing hidden onboard costs for items like food and drinks, according to a survey by Mintel, a market research firm.
Other reasons for staying ashore include concerns that cruises will be too crowded (18 percent), cabins will be too small (14 percent), and the schedule will be too structured (13 percent).
Along with advertising prices that are competitive with land-based vacations (as low as $300), the new Carnival campaign aims to change such perceptions by showing passengers in roomy cabins with private decks, and who are relaxing rather than participating in scheduled activities.
Actors and actresses in the spots are pleasant-looking but not movie star attractive and that, said Roger Baldacci, executive creative director at Arnold Worldwide in Boston, is deliberate.
''When we cast the commercials we try to represent everyday Americans,'' Mr. Baldacci said.
For travelers loath to book a flight to a destination like Miami to begin a cruise there, Carnival is taking a regional approach to its advertising. Unlike earlier campaigns where it bought blanket national television advertising, Carnival is concentrating heavily on 19 markets that have ports or are within driving distance of its 15 American departure ports. The cruise line has 23 ships that depart from those ports.
''Half of the United States is within a five-hour drive from one of our ports,'' Mr. Berra said. ''We're de-emphasizing the Nebraskas and Wyomings of the world and putting more emphasis on places like D.C. and Baltimore.'' (Baltimore is a home port and Washington is nearby.)
Carnival spent $66.4 million on advertising in 2010, more than Norwegian Cruise Line, which spent $56.3 million, and Royal Caribbean International, which spent $53.5 million, according to Kantar Media.
In a television campaign scheduled to begin on Jan. 9, Royal Caribbean also will seek to appeal to those who have not taken a cruise before, but will show ships only in passing and focus more on the appeal of the ocean.
Commercials show city dwellers who encounter conch shells that are ringing and, when they pick them up, they are greeted by the voice of a woman who identifies herself as the sea and asks such questions as, ''When's the last time you visited me?''
The tagline for the campaign: ''The sea is calling. Answer it royally.''
The cruise industry has been expanding for the past two decades, from 3.5 million passengers sailing from American and Canadian ports in 1990 to 10.8 million in 2010, according to the Cruise Lines International Association.
Along with flagship Carnival Cruise Lines, Carnival Corporation, which began in 1972, owns nine other lines, including luxury lines Seabourn and Cunard.
The parent company's entire fleet comprises 100 ships with a capacity for carrying about 8.5 million passengers annually, and it had revenue of $14.5 billion in 2010, up from $13.5 billion in 2009.
In travel industry parlance, the Carnival line is midscale, placing it above economy brands, but below upscale and luxury.
''Carnival is definitely the Chevrolet, the entry-level that everyone can afford and which is a good quality product,'' said Tom Botts, a managing partner at Hudson Crossing, an advisory firm dedicated to the travel industry. ''But it's not like a Seabourn or a Cunard that's up at the Mercedes level.''
As for the new Carnival campaign, Mr. Botts lauded its humor, and how the commercials emphasized the accessibility of cruises to the middle class.
''The message now is, 'Hey, anyone can do this and it's for everybody,' '' Mr. Bott said of the approach. ''It's not all Aristotle Onassis on his yacht -- it's Joe Sixpack drinking a Budweiser.''

HEADLINE: An Auction Of Debt In Spain Lifts Euro

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Spain's borrowing costs plummeted Tuesday at a debt auction, helping to lift the euro and stocks, as the European Central Bank began rolling out a new lending program that could encourage banks to buy euro-zone government bonds.
The Spanish Treasury sold 5.6 billion, or $7.3 billion, of debt, more than the 4.5 billion it had planned to sell after it met with solid demand. It sold three-month bills priced to yield 1.74 percent, down from the 5.11 percent it paid to sell similar securities on Nov. 22. It also sold six-month debt securities at an average yield of 2.44 percent, compared with the 5.227 percent it paid in November. 
The euro bounced up to $1.3120 Tuesday, from $1.2998 late Monday in New York. U.S. stocks opened higher Tuesday, following major European stock indexes, which rose around 2 percent.
The solid result will come as welcome news for Mariano Rajoy, who will take office Wednesday as prime minister of Spain. Analysts attributed the positive result -- as well as a strong Spanish auction last week -- partly to the new E.C.B. initiative.
The central bank on Dec. 8 cut its main interest rate target to 1 percent from 1.25 percent, and said it would begin offering banks unlimited loans of up to three years at that rate, from a maximum of one year previously. It also said it would accept a wider range of collateral for those loans.
The program, officially known as a long-term repo operation, ''is very important,'' Laurent Fransolet, a European rate strategist at Barclays Capital in London, said. ''but it's not easy to understand, so many commentators haven't been focusing on it.''
Mr. Fransolet cautioned that the main purpose of the operation was not to bolster euro-zone sovereign debt, but rather to ensure banks had the funds to refinance themselves ''for a long time.''
The E.C.B.'s new facility does, however, make it possible for banks to borrow from the central bank to fund purchases of government bonds. Using the so-called carry trade, a bank that borrows at 1 percent and buys bonds that yield 4 percent pockets 3 percentage points of yield as income.
The euro-zone credit market has been hurt by the seemingly endless debt crisis , with the E.C.B. warning Monday that some indications were showing levels of stress greater than in the immediate aftermath? of the Lehman Brothers collapse of September 2008.
The E.C.B. will announce the results of its three-year liquidity injection on Wednesday morning, and there is wide uncertainty over the degree of demand. In a Reuters poll, traders estimated banks would ask in aggregate for as little as 50 billion to as much as 450 billion.
''Given the ongoing stresses in the banking system, we expect there to be high demand for these loans,'' Ben May, an economist in London with Capital Economics, said in a research note. ''Nonetheless, we doubt that banks in the region's most troubled economies will go for broke and purchase vast quantities of their governments' debt in a bid to bring bond yields down and avoid damaging sovereign defaults.''
The central bank's policy move ''is something very big,'' Mr. Fransolet said, but he questioned whether it represented ''a complete change of direction'' for the euro zone.
''I think you need a lot of other things,'' he said. With a huge round of government debt up for refinancing next year, he added, ''The jury is still out.''
In a reminder of the sword hanging over the heads of European leaders, Fitch Ratings warned that the AAA rating it has assigned to the debt issued by the euro-zone bailout vehicle, the European Financial Stability Facility, ''largely depends on France and Germany retaining their AAA status.''
Fitch noted that its decision last week to revise the outlook for France to ''negative'' meant that the risk of a downgrade of the bailout fund had also risen.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: As Further Sanctions Loom, Plunge In Currency's Value Unsettles Iran

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Artin Afkhami contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Iran's currency, the rial, tumbled in value to its lowest level ever against the dollar on Tuesday in panic selling caused in part by the country's increased economic isolation from international sanctions, an unbridled inflation problem and worries that government officials there are ideologically incapable of devising a workable solution.
The rial's value has been weakening for months, but the traumatic drop on Tuesday reflected what Iranian economists called a new level of economic anxiety in the country, exacerbated by conflicting information coming out of the Tehran hierarchy that reinforced a sense of indecision and confusion. 
A report in Iran's state-run news media that the government had decided to suspend trading relations with the United Arab Emirates in retaliation for that country's support of American sanctions on Iran -- denied later by Iran's vice president -- apparently contributed to a rush by Iranian merchants and trading companies to sell their rials for other currencies. The United Arab Emirates is a major gateway for Iran's exports.
''This is the most serious financial crisis they've faced, with multiple things coming to a head,'' said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, a professor of economics at Virginia Tech and an authority on Iran's economy. ''I have the feeling that really nobody is in charge of economic policy, nobody who can quickly think on their feet.''
By day's end, Iran's Fars News Agency was reporting that it cost 15,150 rials to buy one dollar in Tehran, compared with 13,400 rials to the dollar a few days earlier. In late October, it cost about 12,500 rials to buy one dollar in the capital city, which means the Iranian currency has plunged in value by about 20 percent against the dollar in the past few months.
The currency crisis could hardly come at a worse time for Iran, which has been pummeled economically by the cumulative effects of four rounds of United Nations Security Council sanctions, as well as sanctions imposed by the United States, Canada and the European Union over the country's suspect nuclear energy program.
An increasing number of international companies are no longer willing to engage in new business with Iran; the European Union has talked about imposing a boycott on Iran's oil, its major export; and the Obama administration is expected to enact a harsh law soon that could severely penalize banks in friendly countries that do business with Iran's Central Bank. Officials in Iran have spoken more frankly in recent days about the destructive impact of Iran's isolation.
The United States Treasury Department added to the pain on Tuesday, putting 10 companies based in Malta on a blacklist for acting as front companies for the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, which has already been blacklisted. The Treasury said in statement that it took the action because the Iranian shipping line and its subsidiaries ''have increasingly relied upon multiple front companies and agents to overcome the impact of U.S. and international sanctions and increased scrutiny of their behavior.''
The rial's loss in value partly reflects the impact of a stubborn inflation problem in Iran, caused in part by the government's phasing out of subsidies for fuel and other staples that has caused prices to rise sharply. To cushion the impact on Iranian consumers, the government distributed cash payments, which in some ways worsened the inflation problem by increasing the supply of rials in Iran. Iran's official news media have said the inflation rate was about 20 percent, although outside estimates were higher.
Economists said the Iran government is hampered in its ability to control inflation partly because of Islamic prohibitions on charging interest, which prevents banks from offering attractive rates that would encourage Iranians to keep their money in savings accounts. Such a step would take money out of circulation.
Some said the catalyst on Tuesday for the panic selling of rials in Iran was an announcement carried by the semiofficial Mehr News Agency that Iran had temporarily stopped imports from the United Arab Emirates ''as a punitive measure'' because its government had expressed support for the Western sanctions.
Later in the day, Vice President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi was quoted by Mehr as saying that the earlier announcement was an overstatement, and that Iran had only issued a warning because ''the U.A.E. has done something, under the pressure of America, which does not hurt Iran but hurts itself.'' He was further quoted as exhorting the Emirates leaders to ''not succumb to American pressure.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 22, 2011; December 26, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about a plunge in the value of Iran's currency, the rial, caused in part by reports that Iran had suspended trade relations with the United Arab Emirates, quoted incorrectly from a statement by Iran's vice president, Mohammad-Reza Rahimi, in which he warned the United Arab Emirates against supporting American sanctions against Iran. Mr. Rahimi said such support ''does not hurt Iran but hurts itself.'' He did not say ''does not hurt the U.S. but hurts itself.''
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about a plunge in the value of the rial, Iran's currency, to a historic low of 15,150 to the dollar, misstated its exchange rate against the dollar in late October and its decline in percentage terms since then. It cost about 12,500 rials to buy a dollar in late October, not 7,000, which means it has declined by about 20 percent in value against the dollar since then, not ''more than 50 percent.''

HEADLINE: Specialty REITs, Exploiting Niche Categories, Outperform the Mainstream Players

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
Real estate investment trusts, or REITs, have largely outperformed other investment vehicles in the sluggish economy of the last few years. But one subset -- ''specialty'' trusts that invest in real estate other than the four major groups of office, retail, residential and industrial -- has been exceptionally solid.
Such trusts that fall into the specialty category can have trouble attracting investors, who often perceive them as being risky, real estate experts said. Typical investment assets are cellphone towers, cold storage warehouses, or transportation and energy infrastructure, among other things. 
''What we've seen is these specialty or noncore property types have actually done pretty well this year,'' said Steve Shigekawa, a co-manager of the Neuberger Berman Real Estate fund, which has about $378 million under management and has invested in several unusual REITs, for timber, self-storage properties and data centers. ''You've seen pretty consistent demand, and growth in net operating income has actually been better than in the more traditional sectors.''
While the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Investment Trusts index shows a year-to-date total return of 3.32 percent, the Dow Jones U.S. Specialty REITs index shows a return of 7.94 percent.
Markets that drive the demand for assets of the specialty REITs tend to be different from the four core trust classes, which can make some of them particularly good investment opportunities in tough economic times, real estate experts said. Self-storage businesses, for example, are obvious beneficiaries of the increase in housing foreclosures and the downsizing of American homes, said Stacy Chitty, a managing partner at Blue Vault Partners, a Georgia company that tracks the performance of public nontraded REITs.
Another sector is data storage centers, which are growing because of increased Internet usage, which seems to be recession-proof. Mr. Chitty mentioned mortgage and real estate-related debt instruments and health care assets as other areas that could flourish in the coming year despite a poor economy.
Entertainment Properties Trust, a REIT that invests primarily in megaplex theaters, has benefited from a shift toward inexpensive entertainment in hard economic times. ''Theaters have tended to be a touch countercyclical -- not wildly, but a touch,'' said David Brain, the chief executive of Entertainment Properties Trust, ''and that proved itself in this most recent recession'' in which 2009 was a record year for the trust. The REITs lumped together into the specialty basket are actually a diverse group of companies with unusual lines of business that can provide singular opportunities for investors, real estate experts said.
While the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts no longer has a ''specialty'' category, it places some of the more unusual trusts into a sector called ''diversified,'' said Ronald C. Kuykendall, the group's vice president of communications.
Some REITs considered specialty in the past, like those investing in self-storage properties, health care assets and timber, have become individual sectors in themselves, Mr. Kuykendall said.
''If a sector gets large enough that it has a significant enough market capitalization, like timber REITs or self-storage, that becomes a sector,'' Mr. Kuykendall said, rather than falling into the ''diversified'' class.
Breaking out of the specialty category has been a boon for the self-storage trusts, said Clint Halverson, a senior director of investor relations for Extra Space Storage Inc., a real estate investment trust based in Salt Lake City, said. The four self-storage REITs now have an equity market capitalization of $27 billion.
''Whereas before when we were lumped into specialty,'' he said, ''you had to market your brand more to investors. It was a little bit more work to get your name out there, and you had to clarify the story and help investors to understand the value proposition in your stock.''
Because REITs that invest in real estate outside the mainstream are often structured differently from traditional ones, financial planners and institutional investors have more research to do in formulating their real estate portfolio strategies. For example, specialty trusts often have an operating business linked with their real estate assets, said Thomas M. Ray, the president and chief executive of the CoreSite Realty Corporation, a REIT that invests in data centers based in Denver.
''Many of the specialty REITs have more of an operational component to them than the traditional four food groups in real estate,'' Mr. Ray said. ''Because that operating component is so much more important and larger in many of the specialty sectors, then expertise and specialization matter.''
For instance, CoreSite acquires, builds and operates data centers, which house the huge servers necessary to store data for businesses with growing Internet needs. Those unfamiliar with operating these types of businesses might have difficulties predicting the cash-flows of a business doing so.
A lack of consistent and long-term performance measures and the small size of some of the niche markets also can make specialty REITs harder to grasp for investors, he said.
''More of the specialty REITs came on the scene in the last 10 years or so,'' Mr. Ray said, ''so you have newer products in these specialty REITS that people need to get to know better, and I think that process is still under way.''
But for the data center REITs, a growing track record is helping overcome investors' lack of experience and misgivings regarding the riskiness of the nontraditional real estate sector. Of the three data center REITs, with a total equity market capitalization of about $8 billion, two are well north of $1 billion, and ''that is somewhat of a bright line for some large institutional investors,'' Mr. Ray said. ''Some investors say, 'If you're less than a billion, it's harder for me to get the size of position I want and harder for me to move in and out of the stock.' ''

HEADLINE: Markets Jump in U.S. and Europe on Positive Economic Data

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stocks surged on Tuesday, partly a result of positive economic data on the housing sector in the United States and brighter signals from the euro zone.
Analysts said the markets were helped by a successful auction of three-month bills in Spain. Also, a report showing improved business sentiment in Germany, Europe's largest economy, offered a glimmer of hope.
The Dow Jones industrial average turned positive for the month and bank shares were up more than 3 percent. Over all, it was a reversal of the drag on the entire stock market on Monday, when financial stocks fell by more than 2 percent, partly as focus shifted to a warning by the European Central Bank of a perilous year ahead. 
But with no stunning news event or resolution to the financial markets' persistent irritants, some questioned the reasons behind the size of the surge on Tuesday.
''I cannot explain today's action in the market,'' Gary M. Flam, an equity portfolio manager at Bel Air Investment Advisors, said in the final hour of trading. ''There has been no news, either positive or negative, to drive a move of this magnitude. I could try to explain it away, but a move of this magnitude is head-scratching.''
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 337.32 points, or 2.9 percent, at 12,103.58. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index showed a gain of nearly 3 percent to 1,241.30. The index's 35.95 point gain was the seventh-best of this year. The Nasdaq composite index was up 80.59 points, or 3.2 percent, at 2,603.73.
As stocks soared, investors left the safety of government bonds. The Treasury's 10-year note tumbled 1 2/32, to 100 21/32. The yield rose to 1.93 percent, from 1.81 percent late Monday.
Many analysts also noted that wild swings were a predictable feature of the end of the year as managers balanced underperforming elements in their portfolios at a time of low trading volume. And even after an impasse over extending a payroll tax cut was announced Tuesday in Washington, the markets held on to their gains.
''The market just seems to have no memory from one day to the next,'' Mr. Flam said. ''To drive a move of this magnitude, you would expect there to be some sort of resolution on the bigger-picture issues.''
The sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone and the prospects of sluggish economic growth have ganged up on the financial markets in recent months. But the data has sometimes broken through the gloom, pointing to a recovery that is sluggish but at least is not stalled.
On Tuesday in the United States, government data showed that housing starts in November hit their highest level since April 2010. They reached 685,000, a seasonally adjusted annualized pace surpassing forecasts of 635,000 and up more than 9 percent compared with October. Building permits also exceeded expectations, reaching 681,000, data from the Commerce Department showed.
And a survey released on Tuesday by the Ifo research group in Munich showed that the business climate for trade and industry in Germany, which is Europe's largest economy, continued to improve in December. ''The German economy seems to be successfully countering the downturn in Western Europe,'' the report said.
Stanley Nabi, the chief strategist for the Silvercrest Asset Management Group, said that the economic reports in the United States and from Europe showed they were ''not doing as badly as expected, and this morning the housing data came out much stronger than expected.''
In addition to recent higher expectations for growth, he said, ''all of these things combined have given a measure of comfort'' to investors.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index closed 2.7 percent higher. The major indexes were up 3.1 percent in Germany, 2.7 percent in France and 1 percent in Britain. The German 10-year bond rose 8 basis points to yield 1.95 percent.
In the euro zone bond market, where sovereign debt concerns have been overriding, the Spanish auction of three-month bills priced to yield 1.74 percent helped sentiment, an analyst said.
''We are still a long way from a fix to Europe's problems, but any ease in funding pressures among member economies is certainly a welcomed development,'' said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company, referring specifically to Spain.
As the euro rose and the United States dollar retreated about 0.5 percent on its index, energy and materials stocks on the broader market surged nearly 4 percent. Oil prices rose more than 3.5 percent, with crude for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $97.35.
Bank of America shares, which closed below $5 on Monday, their lowest point since March 2009, were up 3.7 percent Tuesday at $5.17.
AT&T was up more than 1.3 percent to $29.12. It announced after the markets closed on Monday that it would end its bid to acquire T-Mobile USA.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Were Up in November

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- A surge in apartment construction gave home builders more work in November. And permits, a gauge of future construction, rose largely because of a jump in apartment permits.
The rise in permits provides hope for the housing market, though 2011 is still shaping up as one of the worst years in history for home builders.
Builders broke ground on a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 homes last month, a 9.3 percent jump from October, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. It was the highest level since April 2010. Still, the rate is far below the 1.2 million homes that economists say would be built each year in a healthy housing market. 
Construction of single-family homes rose 2.3 percent in November, while apartment construction jumped 32 percent.
Analysts say the home building industry is improving, albeit modestly, after two of the worst years in history.
''While beginning to improve, a strong, sustained recovery in the housing market, especially the important single-family sector, is still a ways off,'' said Steven Wood, chief economist at Insight Economics.
Last year, builders began work on roughly 587,000 homes, the worst year on record. This year, construction may top 600,000.
Though new homes represent just 20 percent of the overall home market, they have an outsize impact on the economy. Each home built creates an average of three jobs for a year and generates about $90,000 in taxes, according to the National Association of Home Builders.
Renting has become a preferred option for many Americans who lost their jobs during the recession and were forced to leave their houses. The surge in apartments has provided a lift to the housing market but has not been enough to completely offset the loss of single-family homes.
Permits rose 5.7 percent last month, helped by a 16 percent jump in permits for apartment buildings.
Over the last year, permits for apartment buildings with five or more units have surged more than 80 percent. Permits for single-family homes, which account for about 70 percent of all home building, have increased just 3.6 percent.
Demand for new homes is weak. Record-low mortgage rates and plunging home prices have done little to help.
The chief problem is that builders are struggling to compete with deeply discounted foreclosures and short sales. Short sales occur when lenders allow homes to be sold for less than what is owed on the mortgage. Few homes are selling.
After previous recessions, housing accounted for at least 15 percent of United States economic growth. Since the recession officially ended in June 2009, it has contributed just 4 percent.
In October, sales of new homes rose slightly, largely because builders cut their prices in the face of weak demand. Sales hit a six-month low in August. And this year is shaping up to be the worst since the government began keeping records a half-century ago.
Another reason sales have fallen is that previously occupied homes have become a better deal than new homes. The median price of a new home is about 30 percent higher than the median price for a resale. That is nearly twice the markup typical in a healthy housing market.
The home builders' trade group said this week that its survey of industry sentiment rose in December to 21, the highest level since May 2010. Still, any reading below 50 indicates negative sentiment about the housing market. The index has not reached 50 since April 2006, the peak of the housing boom.

HEADLINE: China's High Trade Barriers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article about the 10th anniversary of China's World Trade Organization entry (''Rise of a Trading Power, in 10 Years,'' Business Day, Dec. 9) did not mention one crucial reason China has been allowed to keep unusually high economic barriers. 
The United States and other W.T.O. members did indeed hope ''to encourage Beijing's embrace of capitalism and to make it a more fully vested participant in the global community.'' Yet American-owned multinational companies also lobbied hard and successfully in Washington for China's sweet deal for self-serving reasons.
These companies claimed to be focused on increasing exports from their American facilities to China -- and therefore on reducing Chinese trade barriers. But their highest priority was supplying the lucrative American market from super-low-cost, subsidy-happy and largely regulation-free China -- and therefore keeping America's trade barriers low.
New W.T.O. protections for Chinese exports encouraged these companies to offshore American production and jobs to China, and certainly increased profits. But the $2 trillion-plus in bilateral trade deficits inevitably run up by America since then helped swamp the nation with debts that still threaten our economic future.

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Foster, 54, is a managing director and head of Franklin Templeton Real Asset Advisors, which is based in New York and invests in real estate stocks and funds. Real Asset Advisors is a division of Franklin Resources, based in San Mateo, Calif. Mr. Foster joined Franklin Templeton in 1987.
Interview conducted and condensed by VIVIAN MARINO 
Q. How many assets do you manage?
A. We've got about $5 billion under management, with roughly one-third in the United States, a third in Asia and a third in Europe.
And I'd say we probably have somewhere around half a billion dollars in the New York area, which is a very important area for us. Real estate values have actually gone up in New York in the last three years. There's so much capital looking for safety, and New York is perceived as being one of the safer markets in the world. So we could see more capital coming in and buying offices.
Q. Do you have any supporting numbers?
A. In New York, office values are up from roughly $350 per square foot back in 2009 to $550 today. Rents have also moved up, from roughly $49 a foot to roughly $54 per square foot. And for the year to date we're up to 36 transactions for $11.2 billion. Back in 2009, transaction volume had dropped in Class A and Class B offices to $1.9 billion for the year, or 11 transactions.
On the residential side, what's really interesting is that construction is picking up again. Permits are up dramatically. In some of the boroughs, like Queens, residential permits are up almost 100 percent this year. A lot of it is rentals. The weaker area in the rental, condo or co-op area has been your small units.
Q. Would you say our bottom is a distant memory?
A. In this environment we still have a lot of what we call ''zombie landlords'' -- landlords that cannot operate. They can't pay their mortgage; they can't lease space, because they'll sign themselves into technical default because the rents are too low; but the banks won't foreclose on them. Why? Because as soon as the banks foreclose it becomes a 100 percent reserve requirement against the face of that loan.
We're essentially moving through a period of deleveraging of our global economy. That deleveraging means there has to be pain, and the banks have delayed that pain. But it doesn't help moms and dads who want to borrow to buy a home.
Q. Sounds a little like Occupy Wall Street rhetoric.
A. I think it's a shame to blame Wall Street. We should be blaming our government. Who approved the removal of Glass-Steagall? I think separation of banks and investment banks is very important -- our deposits should not be used for risky, unregulated businesses.
Q. What's your outlook for 2012?
A. I am cautiously optimistic. I think that there will be a retrenchment in the investment banking communities -- there will be some weakness there. I believe we'll see some reduction of staff there, which will weigh on the markets.
Q. How much should the average person be invested in real estate?
A. You want to look at your primary residence as a separate area. So, in my view, I think 7 to 12 percent.
Back in the '70s, they argued for 30 percent allocation to property in risk-averse pension funds, because the volatility was so low and the performance was consistent and stable over time. But all of the managers knew they couldn't sell 30 percent so they cut it in half.
Q. Who are your main clients?
A. Our clients are large pension funds around the world. We also have government sovereign funds that are clients.
Q. What kinds of rates of return do you offer them?
A. The returns on the private funds are 10 to 15 percent over 5 to 10 years. That's our target of return for most of our clients.
Q. Were you always interested in real estate?
A. My father builds houses in Maryland, and that's how I got my start in real estate. I worked with him and then I moved to Manhattan in '83-'84 and first worked for a small brokerage firm doing leasing and sales.
Q. What was your first job at Franklin Templeton?
A. My first job was actually managing the property portfolio for the United Nations. That gave me a very global perspective very early.
Q. You must travel quite a bit.
A. We have major offices around the world and I travel just about every other week. Last week I was in Australia and the week after next I'll be in Korea. A lot of my trips are generally whistle stops.
My children have traveled a lot more than I did when I was their age. My wife has trekked them through China, and they've all been around the world. I want my children to understand the diversity of this planet and to embrace all those different cultures.
Q. So where is your favorite place?
A. My house.

HEADLINE: 3 Million Could Lose Jobless Pay in Impasse

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- More than three million people stand to lose unemployment insurance benefits in the near future because of an impasse in Congress over how to extend the aid and how to offset the cost.
Jobless benefits have been overshadowed by debate on a payroll tax cut, but have become a huge sticking point in negotiations on a bill that deals with both issues.
Republicans would continue aid for some of the unemployed, but would sharply reduce the maximum duration of benefits and impose strict new requirements on people seeking or receiving aid. 
Democrats said these changes made no sense at a time when 45 percent of jobless workers had been unemployed for more than half a year and the average duration of unemployment -- 41 weeks -- was higher than at any time in 60 years.
Jon D. Grandstaff, 50, who lives in a suburb of Tulsa, Okla., said Tuesday that he had been watching the debate in Congress with trepidation, worried that his jobless benefits would be exhausted on Jan. 9.
''This mess in Congress is so upsetting,'' Mr. Grandstaff said in an interview. ''I don't know who to blame -- House, Senate, Republicans, Democrats. They are toying with people's lives. I'm getting really scared and nervous.''
Mr. Grandstaff said he was making $43,000 a year when he was laid off in March from the collections department of a major cellphone company. Now he is working at a part-time job for $8 an hour and hoping the position will lead to full-time work.
Brenda G. Crosier, 52, of Northglenn, Colo., outside Denver, is also at risk of losing extended unemployment benefits. She said she applied for five to eight jobs a week but rarely received responses, and in a telephone interview Tuesday she had this question for Congress:
''Why are you leaving for Christmas vacation? If you worked for a company and you did not have your work done, you would not be walking out the door. You have no business leaving until your work is finished.''
Major provisions of the federal unemployment insurance program begin expiring in the first week of January, and people would begin to feel the effects over the next several months. By mid-February, the Labor Department estimates, 2.2 million workers would have lost jobless benefits, and by the end of March, 3.6 million will be affected.
People in states with the highest unemployment rates would be among the hardest hit.
The cornerstone of the program, regular unemployment insurance benefits, provides up to 26 weeks of assistance financed by the states. In states with high unemployment, jobless workers may be able to get up to 73 weeks of additional benefits, financed by the federal government, for a total of 99 weeks of aid. House Republicans would reduce the maximum to 59 weeks.
''This reflects a more normal level of benefits typically available after recessions,'' said Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said: ''I don't see why you have to go more than 59 weeks. In fact, we need some incentives for people to get back to work. A lot of these people don't want to work unless they get really high-paying jobs, and they're not going to get them ever. So they just stay home and watch television. I don't mean to malign people, but far too many are doing that.''
The Senate version of the payroll tax bill, passed with bipartisan support on Saturday, would continue paying jobless benefits under current law for two months, while lawmakers tried to figure out a longer-term solution.
House Republicans said they wanted a full-year extension, with additional requirements to prevent abuse of the program. They would require most recipients of jobless benefits to search for work and to pursue G.E.D. certificates if they had not completed high school.
Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, said the Republican proposals amounted to ''the most drastic attack on the unemployment system'' in 75 years.
House Republicans would also allow states to require drug testing as a condition of getting benefits. Democrats said such tests were an insult to the unemployed, because they implied that many were lazy drug abusers.
''I don't see anyone in the Republican majority demanding drug testing for folks who receive oil and gas subsidies,'' said Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina.
But Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia, said, ''People who are unemployed should be looking for a job and should not become voluntarily ineligible by taking illegal drugs.''
Democrats say the program has reduced poverty and helped stabilize the economy, reducing the depth of the last recession. Republicans say the benefits have led some people to reduce their efforts to find new jobs.
Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio, said: ''The problem is not a lack of effort for those seeking a job. The problem is a lack of jobs.''
House Republicans said they had borrowed ideas from the jobs bill that President Obama sent Congress in September. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said the president's proposal would probably reduce the maximum length of unemployment benefits to 79 weeks, from the current 99, in many states.
Republicans would allow states to get waivers from many federal standards and requirements, including one stipulating that money from state unemployment taxes must be spent on jobless benefits.
Democrats see the waivers as a threat to the fabric of the unemployment insurance system. But Republicans said that, instead of just writing benefit checks, federal and state officials must do more to help people get back to work.
''In this uncertain economy, using unemployment dollars to subsidize the training of a new employee to re-enter the work force is just good public policy,'' said Representative James B. Renacci, Republican of Ohio.

HEADLINE: An Uneasy Search for Truth as Ghosts From Military Rule Start to Stir

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Lis Moriconi and Erika O'Conor contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.

 BODY:
BRASILIA -- After years of wrangling with the nation's military hierarchy, the authorities here have created a truth commission to examine the abuses of Brazil's long dictatorship, a move hailed as a sign that Brazil could be ready for a more active role against rights abuses, not just at home but globally as well.
But in the weeks since President Dilma Rousseff signed the laws creating the commission and a separate freedom of information measure, Brazil has begun to face the possibility that in the realm of human rights -- unlike on regional economic and diplomatic matters -- the mantle of leadership may not come so easily, after all. Skeptics on both sides are asking, Is the nation prepared to fully grapple with the crimes of its past?
Ghosts from the period of military rule, from 1964 to 1985, have begun to stir, revealing how Brazil, despite emerging as Latin America's rising power and the world's fourth-largest democracy, still trails its neighbors in prosecuting officials for crimes that include murder, disappearance and torture. 
In a display of public fury that has resonated within Brazil's military establishment, a retired military official, Pedro Ivo Moezia de Lima, himself the focus of torture accusations from his time overseeing interrogations in the 1970s, is publicly chafing at the new laws and filed a lawsuit to block the commission from starting its work in January.
The commission has come under fierce criticism from the opposite side of the spectrum, too: some torture victims and relatives of people killed by the dictatorship. They view the commission as a largely token effort because those responsible for abuses committed during military rule remain shielded from prosecution by a 1979 amnesty law.
''The commission isn't about justice, but simply about what's possible in today's Brazil,'' said Cecilia Coimbra, a psychologist who heads Torture Never Again, a group pushing for prosecution of rights abuses. ''It reminds us that we're shamefully behind other countries in coming to terms with our past.''
Other South American countries with military dictatorships around the same time as Brazil, notably Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, have been far more assertive in pursuing old crimes. In Argentina, numerous former military officials have received life sentences, including Jorge Videla, the nation's former dictator. In October, Uruguay's Congress overturned the country's amnesty law, which protected officers from prosecution during military rule lasting from 1975 to 1983.
Brazil, by contrast, has upheld its amnesty law despite a ruling last year by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which said it was invalid. The court, part of the Organization of American States, adheres to a regional human rights agreement, which Brazil has signed.
Some human rights specialists argue that Brazil's new laws are positive steps, compelled partly by the Inter-American court ruling and also by Brazil's ambitions to lead a new Open Government Partnership, a project to increase government accountability around the world.
''They could hardly assume that role without actually passing a freedom of information law and moving into the 21st century on the issue of transparency,'' said Peter Kornbluh, a senior analyst at the National Security Archive, a Washington-based group that works with declassified documents.
Still, Mr. Kornbluh said, ''The Brazilian military is among the most recalcitrant in the world when it comes to acknowledging its responsibility for abuses.''
Even those intimately familiar with the attempts to shed light on Brazil's military years are often at a loss as to why such resistance is tolerated. After all, Ms. Rousseff, who is completing her first year as president, is a former Marxist guerrilla, captured at age 22 during the dictatorship and tortured with electro-shock methods.
Ms. Rousseff, 64, now rarely refers to the brutality she endured, but details emerging from that time offer views into her ordeal and that of others. One black-and-white photo from 1970, published in December by Epoca magazine, stunned many Brazilians. It showed Ms. Rousseff at a military hearing in Rio de Janeiro, seated upright with composure, while her uniformed questioners covered their faces apparently in an attempt to shield their identities from the photographer.
While the truth commission and information law may allow more revelations along these lines, those who have waited decades for justice remain disappointed about Brazil's hesitance in pursuing those responsible for the dictatorship's crimes.
Victoria Grabois, 68, whose husband, brother and father were killed by the military in the 1970s, attributes the reluctance to a political culture that remains ''deeply conservative,'' dating from Brazil's long experience with slavery, despite recently being guided by leaders who resisted the dictatorship.
Another explanation involves the scale of the dictatorship's crimes. Military officials, employing what they describe as a more ''surgical'' counterinsurgency than in other countries, killed an estimated 400 people, compared with killings numbering well into the thousands in Argentina.
The 1979 amnesty law also covered crimes by leftist opponents to the regime as well, thus enabling exiles to return. Moreover, while Brazil has lacked trials of officers, it had something of a reckoning years ago through Brasil Nunca Mais, a project that documented torture methods and published its findings in a best-selling 1985 book, said Glenda Mezarobba, a political scientist who advised officials on creating the commission.
Ms. Mezarobba said she believed that the commission could be an important first step in giving victims a forum to tell their stories. ''Punishment for crimes can also be achieved by submitting the amnesty law to legal challenges in the courts,'' she said.
Military officials protected to this day by the amnesty law disagree, suggesting a bitter legal battle. ''I participated actively in it all,'' said Mr. Moezia de Lima, the retired colonel who filed a suit to block the truth commission, in an interview here. ''I'm very proud of what I did.''
''Torture does not exist,'' he said, employing the present tense, about the treatment meted out to suspected subversives. ''You can say there's a rigor in the interrogation, a rigor in the interview. But this stuff about torture that they talk about, they exaggerate, they invent. Even though I was intensely active, I never laid a hand on any of them.''
Such posturing against scrutiny is still ingrained in Brazil's military. When Ms. Rousseff's predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, previously tried to create a truth commission in 2009, the heads of the army, navy and air force threatened to resign along with the defense minister at the time.
Given such opposition, some here worry that the truth commission, which will have just two years to complete its work in investigating and reporting on the military's abuses, could fall victim to time as those responsible for crimes dwindle in number.
''They're all either are in their 80s,'' said Ms. Grabois, whose family was torn apart by the dictatorship's crimes, ''or dead.''

HEADLINE: ConAgra Posts a Big Quarterly Loss in Net Income, but Still Beats Analysts' Predictions

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
ConAgra Foods reported on Tuesday that its fiscal second-quarter net income fell 15 percent, but the results beat expectations as the company raised prices to offset continuing higher costs. 
ConAgra Foods, like many food companies, is dealing with higher prices for ingredients, packaging and fuel and has raised its prices to offset those increases.
''The marketplace environment remains difficult due to continuing inflationary pressures and the impact of the current economy on consumers, so we are cautious about business conditions,'' said Gary Rodkin, the chief executive.
But Mr. Rodkin acknowledged price increases were helping offset higher costs.
''We're not declaring victory, but we're making good progress,'' he said during a call with analysts.
The results for the company, based in Omaha, were better than analysts expected, and ConAgra reaffirmed its fiscal 2012 outlook. Its shares rose $1.02. or 4 percent, to $26.19.
Net income fell to $171.8 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $200.9 million, or 46 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding one-time items related to derivatives and restructuring, net income was 47 cents a share.
Revenue rose 8 percent, to $3.4 billion from $3.15 billion.
Sales of branded consumer foods, the company's largest division that makes up 63 percent of sales, rose 4 percent, to $2.18 billion.
Top sellers were Banquet, Chef Boyardee, Hunt's, Marie Callender's, Orville Redenbacher's and others.

HEADLINE: U.S. General in Afghanistan Says Troops May Stay Past '14

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- The senior American commander in Afghanistan suggested Tuesday that American forces could remain in the country beyond 2014 despite President Obama's pledge to withdraw them by then. The commander's remarks amounted to the most emphatic signal to date that the United States military intended to secure a presence here, possibly for years.
In an interview with The New York Times, the commander, Gen. John R. Allen, avoided talking about troop levels as America begins to wind down its operations in the war on the Taliban insurgency, now 10 years old. But he said negotiations with the government of President Hamid Karzai on a strategic partnership agreement would ''almost certainly'' include ''a discussion with Afghanistan of what a post-2014 force will look like.'' 
Mr. Karzai had, ''in fact, just the other day talked about his desire to have conversations with the U.S. about a post-2014 force,'' the general said. ''We would probably see some number of advisers, trainers, intelligence specialists here for some period of time beyond 2014.''
Other American officials, including members of the Obama administration, have said 2014 is not a hard deadline for military withdrawal. The United States ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan C. Crocker, said this month that the United States was open to keeping armed forces here if the Afghanistan government asked for them. But General Allen is the highest-ranking American military official so far to explicitly state that possibility.
General Allen emphasized what he called the need for a long-term military and civilian commitment to the country beyond 2014. His proposal for Afghanistan, if followed, might help avoid the outcome of America's other war, in Iraq, where the political instability worsened almost immediately after the last American troops departed.
The general also laid out his vision for American and NATO troops for the next few years.
He expects more military trainers and mentors to come into Afghanistan to work with Afghan troops starting in 2012, he said. Still more would arrive in 2013 as the Afghan security forces were asked to do more. Currently, most Afghan units are partners with NATO forces, and in a number of places the NATO troops still have a dominant role. The idea is that the gradual departure of NATO forces would be cushioned by some Western military support for the Afghan forces in the field.
At the same time, American Special Operations forces, who are heavily involved in many intelligence-driven raids as well as larger and often more dangerous operations, would remain at current levels or increase even as conventional troops were reduced, General Allen said.
The exception may be in eastern Afghanistan, where, General Allen said, ''a pretty virulent insurgency'' remains a problem and where the level of conventional troops will not be drawn down, because insurgent fighters taking refuge in neighboring Pakistan can quickly deploy across the border.
He emphasized, as other American officials have done, that Afghan forces would play a much larger role in the coming years and signaled that much training was still needed. ''The indigenous forces must be the defeat mechanism of the enemy's insurgency,'' General Allen said.
He said he had instructed subordinates to push the Afghan forces and ''get them used to being in combat, doing the planning necessary, the execution of missions, the recovery back, refitting after operations and going back out again.''
His comments were a reminder that despite the American public's exhaustion with the war and resentment of its cost, from a military standpoint the effort will require at least three more years. Whether Congress will be willing to commit the tens of billions of dollars needed is far less clear.
General Allen said that if other countries and foreign donors maintained a presence in Afghanistan, as they say they will, the insurgency's hope of free rein after 2014 would be undercut, which could erode its credibility with followers.
''So if you are the insurgency and you had to rely on popular local support, or if you are the insurgency and part of the foundational dimension of your doctrine has been -- I am just being a little facetious here -- that on 1 January '15, it is going to be the Afghan government against the insurgency, that doctrine is now at risk,'' he said.
Whether foreign countries will fulfill their pledges to continue to support Afghanistan is not clear. Privately, representatives from a number of foreign countries and organizations have raised questions about their longevity in Afghanistan, particularly those in Europe, where economic travails have weakened the appetite for financial commitments in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
General Allen insisted that there seemed to be an opening now to weaken the insurgency, and that some of its members were known to be questioning its potency.
''In 2011, the campaign didn't go well for them, and you can hear that chatter in the insurgent leadership,'' he said, referring to conversations overheard through electronic eavesdropping. He said the eavesdropping had revealed particular concern among insurgents that they were losing popular support in southern Afghanistan, which was once a base of their strength.
The portrait of the insurgency drawn by General Allen was considerably complex, spanning two countries -- Afghanistan and Pakistan -- and composed of different groups. He underscored that while safe havens in Pakistan were important to the insurgency's survival, it also continued to draw sustenance from local Afghans, suggesting that the government had not yet won people over.
General Allen also was cautious in talking about making any progress. He appeared to be mindful that insurgent combatants in the Afghan war had proved tenacious.
The future role of Pakistan is not yet clear. For now, General Allen said, he is focused on repairing the damage done to American-Pakistani relations after a NATO air attack struck two Pakistani border posts last month, killing 25 soldiers. Since then, the Pakistan-Afghanistan border has been closed to NATO trucks. The relationship, already deeply troubled by the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in a Pakistani safe house in May, has worsened.
''Afghanistan is going to be here a long time, and what's critical is that Afghanistan's relationship with its neighbors are, to the maximum extent they can be, constructive and operationally useful,'' General Allen said.

HEADLINE: A Learning Curve as Developers Do Business in China

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
With the slowdown in commercial building in the United States, some American developers are planning projects in China, hoping to capitalize on an immense, increasingly urbanized market with a rising middle class. In recent years, annual consumer spending has been growing by about 18 percent.
But developing in China can be fraught with obstacles. In 2005, the Simon Property Group, the largest shopping center owner and operator in the United States, announced with some fanfare that it would begin developing malls with two partners.
Four malls were built in so-called second-tier cities, like Hangzhou, which has 5.5 million people according to its municipal Web site. But in 2009 -- before three of the malls had opened -- Simon sold its interest and left China. The company told analysts that the cities lacked enough middle-income consumers to make the centers profitable. Simon said it lost $20 million in the venture.
But in October, Simon's chief executive, David Simon, disclosed that his company was in ''serious discussions'' about opening outlet centers in China with a joint-venture partner, and would make a decision in a couple of months. 
Another major American mall company, Taubman Centers, the developer of the only major mall currently under construction in the United States (City Creek Center in Salt Lake City), is planning a foray into China. Last summer, Taubman bought TCBL, a retail consulting company based in Beijing. Robert S. Taubman, the chief executive, said the company planned to build, acquire and update malls throughout China. ''It will be the full spectrum of what we do here,'' said Mr. Taubman.
Other well-known names in North American real estate, including Hines Interests of Houston, Tishman Speyer of New York and Ivanhoe Cambridge of Montreal, are developing projects in China, all with Chinese partners.
To gain access to the huge Chinese market, they have had to brave significant language and cultural barriers, nurture close relationships with receptive local partners, and deal with layers of bureaucratic complexity as well as opaque and unpredictable regulatory and legal systems.
''You don't want to get involved in a legal action because it won't go anywhere,'' said Daniel Winey, a managing principal at Gensler, an international architectural firm with a long track record in China. Gensler was the design architect for the Shanghai Tower, a supersize 121-story office, hotel and retail building now under construction in the architecturally striking Pudong section of Shanghai.
Many private equity investors that flocked to China in 2007, when real estate prices in the United States were soaring, have since left the country.
In China, real estate specialists point out, what gets built depends more on the government's current goals and policies than on market forces. ''It's such a policy-driven market that you have to time not just the market cycles but also the policy cycles,'' said Martin Lamb, the director of Asia Pacific real estate investment for Russell Investments. In recent months, the government has been trying to bring down home prices by tightening credit (though lately this policy appears to be easing). The Chinese have also been encouraging more development of mixed-use communities outside the urban cores and more consumer spending -- and developers have been responding accordingly.
Hines, the developer of the Galleria malls in Houston and Dallas, completed the first phase of one mixed-use development -- the 45-acre California Place in New Jiangwan Town in Shanghai -- before selling its stake last year to two Hong Kong developers. In June, Tishman Speyer, whose properties include Rockefeller Center, began development of the Springs, an even larger project north of Pudong.
Portman Holdings of Atlanta and its partners have nearly finished transforming Jian Ye Li, a cluster of 1930s traditional-style residential buildings in Shanghai, into a mix of luxury apartments and furnished housing for temporary stays. Portman was the designer and one of the developers of China's first mixed-use development, the 1990 Shanghai Center, where the Portman Ritz-Carlton hotel is located.
Of the commercial property sectors, retail seems to offer the greatest opportunities for foreign investors. American developers have played only a minimal role in the tightening office market in Beijing and Shanghai. Hines developed the new 21st Century Tower, a 49-story office building in Pudong with a Four Seasons Hotel, but sold its stake last year to a Hong Kong company.
Western hotel brands are rapidly adding to their management contracts in China, but few foreign companies are developing or investing in the hotels themselves, said David Ling, in charge of China and Southeast Asia for the consulting company HVS Global Hospitality Services.
But some foreign retail developers are venturing into second- or even third-tier cities -- populous places where the modern shopping center is often a novelty. That strategy is not without risks. ''There's not a lot of historical data to do your planning,'' said Sanjay Verma, Cushman & Wakefield's chief executive for Asia and the Pacific.
Retailing specialists say local mall developers are not currently seeking foreign capital but can profit from Western expertise in design, merchandising and attracting the right mix of tenants. ''Partnering with somebody with experience will help them on leasing and builds up the confidence of the retailer,'' said Siu Wing Chu, a senior director at the international brokerage Savills.
Ivanhoe Cambridge, the current owner and operator of Mary Brickell Village in downtown Miami, says it has had success in teaming up with the Bailian Group, the Chinese department store chain, to redevelop La Nova, a lackluster 861,000-square-foot shopping center in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province. Ivanhoe Cambridge made the center more inviting and persuaded its partners to focus on so-called fast fashion.
When the center opened last April, 129,000 people showed up, said Richard Vogel, a senior vice president at Ivanhoe Cambridge. In the first week, shoppers virtually emptied the H&M and Zara stores, said Mr. Vogel, who is based in Shanghai. ''They had to schedule additional deliveries to keep their shelves filled,'' he said.
In 2008, the private equity firm Blackstone bought a vacant shopping mall in Shanghai, called Channel One, and brought in tenants like H&M, Zara and Sephora before selling it to a Hong Kong investment company.
''Private equity companies have been net sellers over the past 12 months,'' said Chris Brooke, the president and chief executive of CBRE in China. Though Simon blamed the absence of a mature consumer market for its frustrating experiences in China, other retail specialists say the giant mall company encountered other problems that are common there, including a difficult relationship with its state-owned partner. (Simon declined to be interviewed for this article.)
Before joining Russell Investments, Mr. Lamb was in China to develop shopping centers anchored by Walmart stores. Just getting a copier was an exercise in frustration that required three different licenses, he said. ''Once we had Chinese employees, one of them said, 'You should have asked me. My brother would have gotten it for you,' '' Mr. Lamb said.
In China, he said, a contract is considered more of a guide than a legally binding document ''We were always told, 'If you have a dispute with your tenant, take them out to dinner,' '' he said.
Despite the potential pitfalls, companies with the breadth of a Simon or a Taubman have the potential to succeed in China, but others may face insurmountable challenges, because China's fast-growing development companies see no need to share their profits, said Jack Portman, a vice chairman of his family's company. ''If you're not already there with existing relationships, it's probably too late,'' he said. ''Unless you have something special to contribute, they don't need it.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the Square Feet pages last Wednesday about North American investment in Chinese commercial real estate described incorrectly the relationship of Ivanhoe Cambridge, a Canadian developer, to Mary Brickell Village, a shopping center in Miami. Ivanhoe Cambridge is the current owner and operator; he was not the developer.

HEADLINE: China Exerts Influence Nurtured Over Decades

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG. 
Michael Wines contributed reporting, and Li Bibo and Mia Lia contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China, North Korea's foremost ally, appears to be moving quickly to try to ensure stability in a crippled and isolated nation now facing a leadership transition fraught with dangers.
According to former government officials and analysts, Chinese and foreign, China's leaders had been hoping that Kim Jong-il, who died on Saturday, would live for at least two or three more years to solidify the succession process that he had begun with his youngest son, Kim Jong-un. Uncertainty now looms, not only over whether the younger Kim can consolidate his power in the face of competing elite factions, but also over whether the elder Kim's economic initiatives, which had included several visits to China to study it as a model for possible economic reforms, will continue.
So, the analysts and former officials say, the Chinese are seeking to deepen their influence over senior North Korean officials, particularly in the military, and to use the channels they have kept open with North Korea even as the West, frustrated over its nuclear intransigence, closed doors. China's highest priority is one shared far more broadly: guarding against a rise in tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula. That is a distinct possibility if North Korean generals try to reinforce their hold on power through aggression toward South Korea. 
In its first approach to the government in Pyongyang since its leader's death, China said on Tuesday that it was open to a visit by his son and anointed successor.
After President Hu Jintao of China visited the North Korean Embassy in Beijing to express his condolences, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Liu Weimin, was quoted by Reuters as saying: ''I want to add that China and North Korea have always kept up high-level visits, and we welcome the North Korean leader to visit at a convenient time to both sides.'' He did not elaborate.
''At this moment, China might provide the best chance of stability,'' said Robert Carlin, a former State Department official and fellow at Stanford University who travels to North Korea.
''They want to be the best informed and have a modicum of influence and have people consulting with them at this moment,'' Mr. Carlin said. ''The rest of us are deaf, dumb, blind and with our arms tied behind our backs.''
John Delury, a scholar of China and the two Koreas at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea, said: ''Chinese diplomats are the only ones who can pick up the phone and talk to North Korean counterparts about what is going on, what to expect. This reveals the fatal weakness in Washington and Seoul's over-reliance on sanctions over the past three years.''
The worries among some Chinese were evident. ''The death significantly enhances uncertainty on the peninsula,'' said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. ''In my personal view, the succession is very hastily arranged, and Kim Jong-un is very ill prepared to take over.''
China values North Korea as a buffer state that keeps American troops in South Korea at a distance, but relations between the two communist countries have endured complicated twists in recent years. Chinese officials were upset by North Korea's sudden shelling of Yeonpyeong Island in South Korea last year, and have lobbied North Korea to refrain from further military actions, analysts say. Earlier in 2010, China was put in an awkward position when South Korea and the United States accused North Korea of sinking the Cheonan, a South Korean warship, with a torpedo. The United States pressured China to agree with its accusation, which China refused to do. North Korea denied any involvement.
Those episodes, while increasing strains, have also made North Korea more dependent on China. China and South Korea recently accounted for 55 percent to 80 percent of North Korea's trade, according to a paper published this year by two scholars of North Korea at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics, Stephan Haggard and Marcus Noland. After the Cheonan sinking, most of North Korea's trade with South Korea stopped, making China an even bigger partner.
Exact trade figures are difficult to pinpoint. A paper published in December 2010 by the Congressional Research Service estimated that in 2009, exports from North Korea to China increased to $793 million, while Chinese exports to the North slowed slightly to $1.9 billion. Chinese trade and investment undercut the economic sanctions that the United States and other nations imposed on North Korea to try to halt its nuclear program.
The trade can take many forms. Susan Shirk, a former State Department official and professor of political science at the University of California at San Diego, said she had spoken with a North Korean man in Pyongyang in September who was conducting state-to-state trade with China. She said the man worked for the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and he was selling iron ore to China at the price that China pays to large trade partners like Australia; in return, he was buying corn from China at the price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange that day.
North Korean leaders are also trying to jump-start the languishing trade zone of Rason on the Chinese border and to get Chinese businesses to invest in tourism infrastructure, including a creaking cruise ship running between Rason and the Mount Kumgang nature park.
''China and North Korea are locked in this dance of interdependency,'' said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, an analyst based in Beijing for the International Crisis Group. ''China is going to have to continue to be a big benefactor and bankroll North Korea to a big extent.''
On Monday, as anxieties over North Korea's path bubbled to the surface in Beijing, so did signs of mourning. People brought bouquets of white flowers to the North Korean Embassy in Beijing and were allowed inside. Police officers surrounding the building kept all others at a distance. Asked about visas, a guard said, ''Come back next year.'' The flag atop the embassy roof was lowered to half-staff. One resident of Beijing with ties to North Korea said telephone operators in Pyongyang were crying when he got through to a call center there.
Evening newspapers in China ran front-page headlines. Xinhua, the state news agency, cited a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ma Zhaoxu, who called Mr. Kim a ''great leader'' and added, ''China and North Korea will strive together to continue making positive contributions.''
There were some irreverent takes. Netease, a popular Internet portal, ran a topics page with a headline saying, ''Kim Jong-il's Death Shows the Importance of Losing Weight.'' The subtitle was even more subversive: ''A government is just like a human body, in that neither can afford to be too fat.''

HEADLINE: A Positive Spin On Too-Big-to-Fail

BYLINE: By ROB COX and PETER THAL LARSEN

 BODY:
Call it ''G-Sifi envy.'' International regulators have decided to designate 29 banks as global systemically important financial institutions, or G-Sifis. That will introduce this new competitive dynamic to international finance in 2012.
Banks that made the list last month will be required to hold more capital. But they will also benefit from being codified as banks that are effectively too big to fail. That puts smaller rivals at a disadvantage. It's a race to the top, but not in the way regulators envisioned. 
In November, the Financial Stability Board, at the behest of the Group of 20 nations, identified those banks whose failure ''would cause significant disruption to the wider financial system and economic activity.'' The list, based on a series of measures including size, international reach and interconnectedness, included the usual suspects: Wall Street titans like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley; Switzerland's two biggest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse; the largest commercial lenders in Europe, Britain, the United States and Japan; and custodial banks like State Street and Bank of New York.
But the list may be more notable for its omissions. For instance, no Canadian institution made the cut. And while Bank of China was added at the request of Chinese regulators, its immediate rival, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, was not. Similarly, HSBC made the grade, but not Standard Chartered, with which it competes tooth and nail in Asia. In Europe, Santander of Spain and UniCredit of Italy were designated systemically important, but their cross-town rivals BBVA and Intesa were not. Nomura of Japan was a no-show, though Sumitomo, Mizuho and Mitsubishi UFJ appeared.
Big bank chief executives like Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan Chase opposed the G-20 initiative. But many of them are now expecting to benefit from the designation. From the start of next year, banks on the list will be forced by their national regulators to hold extra capital ranging from 1 to 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, depending on how big an impact their default might have on the global financial system. Their resolution regimes -- plans that allow big lenders to be wound down if they run into trouble -- will also be subject to international scrutiny.
The extra capital will hit returns. But this is not such a disadvantage in countries like Britain, Italy and Spain, where regulators have already set higher capital hurdles for the biggest local banks. Moreover, in the eyes of credit rating agencies and customers, banks with a G-Sifi label will be deemed stronger counterparties. In certain businesses, particularly foreign exchange, credit derivatives, cash management, transaction processing and even equity and fixed-income trading, this competitive edge could outweigh the cost of holding more capital.
Lower financing costs may also accompany the halo effect of being too big to fail. That has certainly been the experience in the United States since the government stepped in to prop up the country's biggest banks in 2008. Smaller American banks pay almost 50 percent more than the top 100 lenders for deposits, the most stable form of financing, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's most recent industry report.
Banks just below the systemically important threshold may have to maintain even higher levels of capital to compete with their larger rivals for international business. Some may even pursue acquisitions to improve their chances of being added to the list when it is next reviewed.
Being designated a G-Sifi is not a one-way bet. The sliding capital scale means banks will have to hold more equity as they expand. To discourage the biggest banks from making themselves even more systemically important, regulators have reserved the right to expand the capital buffer to 3.5 percent. And when regulators eventually draw up credible plans to wind down big lenders, the benefits of size should be diminished.
Those not on the list can equally try to make the case that they do not need a special designation from the G-20 to be deemed safe. Canadian banks, for instance, might justifiably argue that the nation's regulatory structure proved its superiority during the financial crisis.
Nevertheless, now that they are stuck with it, some of the big banks are gearing up to make the G-Sifi label a central plank of their pitch to clients. It is hardly what regulators had in mind when they first set out to tackle the too-big-to-fail problem.

HEADLINE: Two Conservatives in Iowa Urge Support for Santorum

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Richard A. Oppel Jr. contributed reporting from Pella, Iowa.

 BODY:
DE WITT, Iowa - Rick Santorum, who was the first Republican presidential hopeful to visit all 99 Iowa counties in a quest to gain traction for the party's nomination, received a lift on Tuesday by collecting a highly coveted endorsement from Bob Vander Plaats, one of the most visible leaders of the Christian conservative movement.
Two weeks before the Iowa caucuses open the Republican nominating contest, many of the state's evangelical voters have yet to unify behind one candidate. Tensions among influential groups have split the support of Christian conservatives, but Mr. Vander Plaats urged party activists to support Mr. Santorum. 
''It just shows that we're the candidate the folks see as on the way up,'' Mr. Santorum said after learning of the endorsement. ''We're the candidate right now that has the momentum, that has the message that is resonating to the people of Iowa, and I think they are probably catching that.''
Mr. Vander Plaats, who has sought to put his imprint on the Republican presidential race, and other evangelical leaders have talked openly about their difficulty in choosing a candidate. For weeks, Mr. Vander Plaats has made supportive statements about Newt Gingrich, which touched off a storm of criticism among social conservatives here.
As he made his announcement on Tuesday, Mr. Vander Plaats did not stop with only an endorsement. He urged other socially conservative candidates to consider dropping out of the race and extending their support to Mr. Santorum, so he ''could quickly vaunt into first place and win the nomination.''
That suggestion was dismissed by campaign advisers to rival candidates.
For Mr. Santorum, the backing of Mr. Vander Plaats and Chuck Hurley, another prominent conservative leader, the endorsement comes at a critical time. He is trying to persuade Republican voters in Iowa to give his candidacy a second look, hoping that a stronger than expected finish could help him break through.
''He could be the Huckabee in this race,'' Mr. Vander Plaats told reporters, referring to former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2008.
At this late stage in the campaign, it remains an open question how the endorsement from Mr. Vander Plaats will affect the race. His political activity, including leading the effort to remove three judges from the Iowa Supreme Court last year in a battle over same-sex marriage, has made him a lightning rod in some Republican circles.
The Family Leader, a conservative group that Mr. Vander Plaats formed after losing a bid for the Republican nomination for Iowa governor last year, narrowed its choices last month to Mr. Santorum, Gov.Rick Perry of Texas, Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Mr. Gingrich.
The board of directors of the Family Leader announced Tuesday that they would formally remain neutral in the race because of divided loyalties among candidates. Mr. Vander Plaats and Mr. Hurley said their endorsements were personal and were not made as representatives of their organizations.
Mr. Perry, Mr. Gingrich and Mrs. Bachmann had aggressively courted the socially conservative leaders, hoping that an endorsement would provide a burst of momentum in the closing weeks of the contest here. As his campaign bus rolled through eastern Iowa on Tuesday, Mr. Perry reminded reporters that the Family Leader group remained neutral.
''You've got a number of really serious conservatives in the race, both social and fiscal conservatives,'' Mr. Perry said, noting Mr. Santorum and Mrs. Bachmann by name. ''I was not surprised at all that they stayed neutral, but you'd always love to get good endorsements like that.''
While social conservatives have held an outsize influence in previous campaigns here, polls show that the economy is the overriding issue for all Republicans who plan to attend the caucuses on Jan. 3. By failing to coalesce around a single candidate, Republicans here say the weight of evangelical voters could be diminished.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: House Vote Bars Brief Extension Of Tax Reduction

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Jennifer Steinhauer and Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After defiantly rejecting a Senate compromise to extend a payroll tax break and jobless pay, Speaker John A. Boehner stood before the television cameras on Tuesday enveloped by scores of House Republicans. Even as a group, they seemed very much alone.
By turning down a bill that was overwhelmingly supported by both parties in the Senate as well as the White House, the conservative House majority that has spent the year inciting combative legislative showdowns is now staring over the brink, standing fast against legislation with significant financial consequences for nearly every American household. 
Over just a few hours on Tuesday, President Obama held an impromptu news conference to sharply criticize them, the House floor exploded with partisan derision and many members then headed for the airports, not knowing how or if the legislative battle would end. In a year of bitter legislative standoffs, the preholiday clash over the payroll tax was as tense as any, ripe with potential political repercussions in the first days of an election year.
Mr. Boehner of Ohio, the first-year speaker who has struggled throughout 2011 to corral his members, said House Republicans would not relent and accept a two-month extension of the tax cut that was approved by the Senate on Saturday as a way to buy time for a more permanent solution. He instead named members to a committee to negotiate a new agreement with the Senate, which adjourned Saturday.
Republicans, many of whom said just a few weeks ago that they did not want an extension of the tax cut at all, have now pivoted in the opposite direction, saying they would accept a one-year deal or nothing at all, citing the uncertainty of a stopgap plan.
Mr. Boehner called Mr. Obama to summon the Senate back to Washington to bargain with House Republicans despite the approach of the holidays. ''I just think the American people expect us to do our work,'' Mr. Boehner said.
But he was rebuffed by Mr. Obama, and by House and Senate Democrats, who said they would appoint no counterparts to Mr. Boehner's newly named negotiators. And more Republican senators who voted for the Senate bill urged Mr. Boehner to get his lawmakers to do the same, saying the ugly fight was damaging both Republicans and the already badly battered Congress.
''It is harming the Republican Party,'' Senator John McCain of Arizona said in an interview on CNN. ''It is harming the view, if it's possible anymore, of the American people about Congress. And we've got to get this thing resolved and with the realization that the payroll tax cut must remain in effect.''
If no resolution can be found, House Republicans -- who have managed to escape the tag of the party that shut down government despite repeated close calls -- now risk the odd political development of being accused of being the impediment to a tax cut.
''This is the walk-away caucus with the walk-away leadership that are walking away from 160 million Americans,'' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat.
The impasse deepened Tuesday with a spirited debate over the bill to reject the Senate plan and call for new negotiations, which passed 229 to 193. ''The sanctimonious rhetoric you hear from Republicans is nothing but talk, baby talk,'' said Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, glowering from the House floor.
Republican members fired back, saying that the Senate should not be able to dictate legislative terms to the House. ''The arrogance of this place is outstanding. It's unbelievable,'' said Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York.
Not a single Democrat joined the House Republicans in rejecting the Senate bill on Tuesday -- a rare occurrence. An hour after that vote, Mr. Obama swept unannounced into his press secretary's daily briefing with White House reporters. He called the Senate measure -- which would maintain a two-month extension of a payroll tax holiday for 160 million workers, continue unemployment benefits for millions more and maintain Medicare reimbursement fees for doctors -- ''the only viable way to prevent a tax hike, on Jan. 1. The only one.''
Millions of Americans, and the overall economy, would suffer without such action, he said. ''The clock is ticking; time is running out,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And if the House Republicans refuse to vote for the Senate bill, or even allow it to come up for a vote, taxes will go up in 11 days.''
Mr. Boehner returned his own televised volley minutes later from the Capitol, where he stood with roughly 150 House Republicans to announce his appointees to a conference committee that is not likely to meet soon. His appointees -- many of them vocal opponents of a payroll tax holiday in the past -- are now set to pass the next days in Washington, awaiting a blink from the Democrats.
As the House took its last votes of the year on Tuesday -- unless it takes up a new payroll tax measure or reconsiders the Senate plan -- Mr. Hoyer and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, sparred on the House floor, while members booed, hissed, clapped and yelped from their seats, British Parliament style.
''I think the people of this country are tired of hearing what Washington can't do and want to see what we can do,'' said Mr. Cantor, adding, ''the people of this country are beginning to wonder about the body on the other side of this Capitol and are wondering what the leader over there has against the middle class of this country.'' (Mr. Cantor said he preferred a yearlong bill, but, like many of his Republican colleagues, he has in the past also questioned the wisdom of reducing payroll taxes, which feed the Social Security fund.)
While Congress appeared stuck Tuesday night, there were several ways the matter could still be resolved.
Republicans could decide to accept the two-month extension as is or with additional sweeteners, like a promise that a conference committee would meet to seek a longer-term extension, but such a move would require unanimous consent from the Senate. They could add another social policy rider, as is their tendency, and the Senate could toss it off the bill later, through a procedure that has been employed in the past. Or they could do similar procedural moves with a bill to extend the benefits for a year, which has been the goal of Mr. Obama and Democrats all along.

HEADLINE: From Growls of Punk Rock to the Smooth Talk of Politics

BYLINE: By PATRICK WALL

 BODY:
Santa had a few minutes to kill before a holiday party the other evening, so he pulled up his sleeves and showed off some of his tattoos: a dragon, a sailboat and, inked across the nape of his neck, the phrase ''Meat Is Murder.''
The man in red, played by Justin Brannan, was sitting in the Brooklyn office of his boss, City Councilman Vincent J. Gentile, whose district includes Bay Ridge and Dyker Heights. Mr. Brannan, 33, is the councilman's director of communications and legislative affairs. 
He also happens to be a former Wall Street back-office worker and a founding member of two world-touring hardcore punk bands.
''We have legions of screaming fans in Croatia,'' Mr. Brannan said recently. ''Then I walk down Third Avenue, and no one knows who I am.''
Mr. Brannan was a sophomore at Xaverian High School, a Catholic boys' school in Bay Ridge, when he and some friends formed the hardcore band Indecision, with Mr. Brannan on chainsaw guitar. The group's raucous sound -- think feral growls and machine-gun rhythms -- and its radical politics soon elevated it from local bars to larger sites.
After Indecision dissolved, Mr. Brannan and others who had been in Indecision formed Most Precious Blood, which released three albums and toured six continents before going on indefinite hiatus in 2007.
Between tours, Mr. Brannan worked as a temporary employee for Wall Street investment banks and had a short-lived radio career, as an intern for ''The Howard Stern Show'' and as a traffic reporter for WNEW-FM.
In 2007, he landed a job at Bear Stearns, where he worked until the company was sold the next year.
After Bear Stearns, Mr. Brannan did consulting and fund-raising work for local nonprofit groups. His girlfriend, now fiancee, opened an after-school art program for children in a storefront on Third Avenue, the kind of business that might have seemed out of place a decade or two ago in famously conservative Bay Ridge but is now part of the neighborhood's changing face. And through all his connections, Mr. Brannan grew more active in local politics.
Michael Esposito, an Indecision bandmate who now runs the Gold Coast Delicatessen, where Mr. Brannan was doing his Santa act, said that his old friend had grown from ''the king of prank phone calls'' into one of the neighborhood's movers.
In the spring, Mr. Brannan was hired as Mr. Gentile's press aide. Years ago, Mr. Brannan fretted about unruly mosh pits or the collapse of the financial system, but now he sweats over storm drains, senior centers and litter baskets.
He must also throw water on political flare-ups, like the news that the Campaign Finance Board fined Mr. Gentile nearly $27,000 for spending violations. (Mr. Brannan said that accounting errors were to blame.)
But Mr. Brannan's ambitions seem to extend beyond the councilman's office.
He is president of a newly formed political club, the Bay Ridge Democrats, which has already hosted some impressive guests, including the New York City comptroller, John C. Liu, and the public advocate, Bill de Blasio. Mr. Brannan's name has come up in conversations among some Democrats about possible candidates to challenge State Senator Martin J. Golden, a Republican.
For now, Mr. Brannan said, he has no plans to run for office, though he has not ruled out the possibility.
Any future campaigns would be complicated by Mr. Brannan's colorful past. Already, one conservative blog has called attention to a Most Precious Blood album, ''Our Lady of Annihilation,'' whose cover features an image of the Virgin Mary with explosives strapped to her body.
''That's something I'll probably have to pay a consultant millions of dollars to explain,'' Mr. Brannan said. He added that the image was meant to evoke ''the lunacy of killing in the name of religion.''
At the party at Gold Coast, sponsored by the Merchants of Third Avenue Association, the old thrasher let out a hearty ''Ho, ho, ho!'' Later, he addressed the crowd.
''I just want to say,'' said the punk-rock-politico Santa, ''that Bay Ridge is my favorite place on Earth.''

HEADLINE: For Gingrich in Power, Pragmatism, Not Purity

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Newt Gingrich arrived in Washington in January 1979 as a brash congressman dreaming of a Republican revival. Not quite four years later, frustrated at the pace of change, he quietly sought counsel from a man he had once worked to defeat: Richard M. Nixon.
Mr. Gingrich entered national politics in his party's liberal wing; as a young graduate student in 1968, he campaigned for Nixon's opponent, Nelson A. Rockefeller. Now, over a dinner in New York, the disgraced former president instructed the impatient lawmaker to build a coalition -- the noisier the better.
''He said, 'You cannot change the country unless you are interesting and attract attention,' '' Mr. Gingrich recalled in a speech years later. ''And to do that, you have to have a group.''
Mr. Gingrich promptly founded the Conservative Opportunity Society, a band of activist lawmakers who helped usher in the 1994 Republican revolution that made him his party's first House speaker in 40 years. 
But many of the conservatives who rode to power with Mr. Gingrich ultimately deserted him, while he denounced them as ''petty dictators'' and ''the perfectionist caucus'' in the waning days of his tumultuous four-year speakership.
Today as he seeks the Republican nomination for president, Mr. Gingrich, 68, remains a paradoxical figure for conservatives to embrace -- a man who can ''bring us together, and alienate the hell out of us,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who as a House member tried to oust Mr. Gingrich in an unsuccessful 1997 coup. Many credit him with advancing their cause, yet many are deeply suspicious of him.
A look at Mr. Gingrich's earliest days in politics, and the evolution of his thinking, helps explain the rocky relationship between Mr. Gingrich and the movement he once led. He emerges as more of a pragmatist than a purist, a believer in ''activist government'' whose raw ambition made colleagues uneasy, provoking questions about whether he was motivated by conservative ideals, personal advancement -- or both.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Gingrich calls himself the ''conservative alternative to Mitt Romney.'' As he seeks to appeal to Tea Party voters, he often invokes a conservative icon, Ronald Reagan. But some say he more closely resembles another Republican president.
''Gingrich is more Nixonian than he is Reaganite,'' said Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman and the first chairman of the Conservative Opportunity Society, who is on good terms with Mr. Gingrich but supports Mr. Romney. ''Not in the Watergate sense, in the strategic sense. He is not an ideologue.''
A Man With a Plan
From the moment he entered politics, Newt Gingrich was a man with a plan to remake the Republican Party -- with himself at the top.
He made little secret of his ambitions when, as a 25-year-old graduate student at Tulane University in New Orleans, he signed on with the 1968 Rockefeller campaign. One night, the man who would go on to describe himself as a ''transformative figure'' and ''definer of civilization'' stunned fellow volunteers by telling them he thought he could one day be president.
''He was very into himself,'' said Kit Wisdom, a leader of the Rockefeller Louisiana campaign, ''and in charge of everything.''
His political philosophy was ''in the middle,'' Ms. Wisdom said. He was antitax, and hawkish on defense, but a strong environmentalist and advocate of civil rights. He courted black supporters and later told his biographer, Mel Steely, that he felt ''a moral obligation to support the candidate who was intensely for integration.''
But while he may have felt a moral obligation, Mr. Gingrich also saw political opportunity as a Republican in a South dominated by conservative Democrats. He believed the future of the party in the South was to be ''the moderate, progressive alternative to the old-line Dixiecrats,'' Mr. Weber said. And he saw a chance to move quickly up the party ranks.
He made his first bid for office in 1974, while a history professor at West Georgia College, now the University of West Georgia, by challenging Representative John J. Flynt Jr., a conservative Democrat. Mr. Gingrich knew he could not ''out-conservative'' Mr. Flynt, one former aide recalled. So he sought to paint his opponent as corrupt, a tactic he would later use against Democrats like the House Speaker Jim Wright.
He lost that year, and again to Mr. Flynt in 1976. But two years later, when the seat opened up, Mr. Gingrich tacked right, ran on a traditional antitax Republican platform and won. His disdain for the Republican leadership was evident; in a speech to College Republicans that year, he railed against Nixon and Gerald R. Ford for their failure to build a majority.
''They have done a terrible job, a pathetic job,'' Mr. Gingrich thundered, unaware that his words were being recorded. ''In my lifetime, literally in my lifetime -- I was born in 1943 -- we have not had a competent national Republican leader. Not ever!''
Mr. Gingrich went on: ''I think that one of the great problems we have in the Republican Party is that we don't encourage you to be nasty. We encourage you to be neat, obedient, and loyal and faithful and all those Boy Scout words, which would be great around the campfire, but are lousy in politics.''
Ideas, Yes. Theories, No.
In Washington, Mr. Gingrich quickly became known as an ideas man. He aligned himself with Jack Kemp, the New York congressman whose advocacy of tax cuts and civil rights fit with Mr. Gingrich's own brand of Republicanism, and he backed Reagan in 1980.
Even so, Mr. Gingrich's ideas made some in his own party nervous.
In 1979, his first year in office, Mr. Gingrich was among a handful of freshman Republicans to vote to create the federal Department of Education, a vote that many conservatives, who want to abolish the department, still hold against him. (Today Mr. Gingrich says he wants to ''dramatically shrink'' the agency.)
Ever the history professor, he gave long, meandering speeches on the House floor, calling himself a ''Teddy Roosevelt Republican'' and extolling the virtues of ''activist government.'' When President Jimmy Carter proposed an Alaskan wildlife reserve, Mr. Gingrich voted in favor, breaking with his party.
His support for more federal investment in transportation, science, space programs and technology rattled libertarians and free market conservatives; the Club for Growth, an advocacy group, complains that Mr. Gingrich has ''a recurring impulse to insert the government in the private economy.'' In a 1984 interview with Mother Jones Magazine, Mr. Gingrich was unapologetic.
''I believe in a lean bureaucracy,'' he said, ''but not no bureaucracy.''
In intellectual circles, Mr. Gingrich raised eyebrows; he drew inspiration not from theorists like Edmund Burke and Friedrich Hayek, but from futurists like Isaac Asimov and Alvin Toffler.
''I call Newt an experiential conservative, as opposed to a deeply philosophical conservative,'' Paul M. Weyrich, a conservative activist, once told the PBS program Frontline. ''He does not have a deeply held philosophy, say, biblically based philosophy as some of us do.''
The culture wars that energized Christian conservatives held little interest for the new congressman from Georgia. ''Newt's basic inclination is to let people be people -- if it's not against the law then it's none of our business,'' said Mr. Steely, who taught history alongside Mr. Gingrich and later worked in his Congressional office.
Over time, Mr. Gingrich would develop what his campaign now calls ''a consistent pro-life record'' on abortion. But early in his career, when his aides pressed him to take a position, he resisted, said Steven M. Gillon, a University of Oklahoma historian who examined Mr. Gingrich's Congressional papers while researching a book, ''The Pact.''
''I would never vote against my conscience,'' the book quotes Mr. Gingrich as telling his staff in 1983. ''On the other hand, I also make it a habit to have relatively few things I feel bitterly moral about.''
Advice From an Old Hand
The year 1982 was dismal for Republicans; with unemployment topping 10 percent, the party lost 26 seats in the midterm elections. Mr. Gingrich feared the Reagan revolution was slipping away, and along with it his dreams of building a Republican majority -- and becoming speaker.
He had already spent considerable time trying. In 1980, Mr. Gingrich staged an event on the steps of the Capitol for Republicans to publicly commit to a ''G.O.P. National Contract'' that pledged tax and spending cuts, much like the Contract With America later would in 1994. He wanted a national strategy for Republicans, a novel thought at the time. But the event gained little traction.
Mr. Gillon, the University of Oklahoma historian, sees Mr. Gingrich during this period as going through a kind of ''identity crisis, looking for some way that he could emerge from the pack.''
His dinner with Nixon in the fall of 1982 was an attempt to do just that. Even in exile, the former president remained a savvy political observer and kept in touch with Republicans in Washington. That night, the two men spent three hours together, along with Mr. Gingrich's second wife, Marianne. (They met again in Washington in 1984 when Mr. Gingrich arranged for Nixon to talk about policy with House Republican freshmen.)
Mr. Gingrich later recounted the New York dinner in his book ''Lessons Learned the Hard Way.'' ''I told him I thought the Republicans at long last ought to become the majority in the House,'' Mr. Gingrich wrote. ''He shook his head and said that the House Republican Party had little impact and received little attention from the press because it was so boring.''
Back in Washington, Mr. Gingrich asked a Republican pollster, Robert Teeter, to test public reaction to the phrases ''conservative opportunity state'' and ''liberal welfare state,'' said Frank Gregorsky, then Mr. Gingrich's chief of staff. The responses came back three to one in favor of the first. Mr. Gregorsky remembers his boss as ecstatic, convinced he had found a winning formula.
''The essence of Newt,'' Mr. Gregorsky said, ''is that he's a marketing genius. He's not a philosopher or an ideologue.''
For Mr. Gingrich, it was an important turning point. He quickly began recruiting members for his new ''Conservative Opportunity Society'' -- he later called the group a ''direct descendant of Richard Nixon's advice'' -- and put together a companion coalition of like-minded outside activists. They met every Wednesday to plot strategy. Participants remember him as a man in motion, always searching for the perfect catchphrase or issue for Republicans to exploit.
''He was constantly probing with bayonets,'' said Grover Norquist, the antitax advocate, who attended those sessions, ''constantly trying to figure out what would work.''
Over the next decade, Mr. Gingrich established himself as a partisan firebrand and the undisputed leader of a bold new conservative movement. ''Conservatives liked him because he was so bombastic, so willing to take on the liberals,'' said John Feehery, a Republican strategist and former Capitol Hill aide. But some had nagging suspicions, Mr. Feehery said, that Mr. Gingrich was ''more moderate personally than he lets on.''
His fascination with tactics, his past as a Rockefeller Republican and his grandiose statements bred mistrust. Some wondered if he was interested in advancing conservative ideals, or his own political future. ''I have an enormous personal ambition,'' he told The Washington Post in 1985. ''I want to shift the entire planet. And I'm doing it.''
'The Ultimate Pragmatist'
Nearly a decade later, on the morning after election night 1994, the soon-to-be House speaker could barely contain himself. He vowed to stamp out the ''Great Society, counterculture McGovernick'' legacy of Democrats and to put his own conservative imprint on American society.
Nixon, who died earlier that year, did not live to see his unlikely protege's triumph. But he approved of Mr. Gingrich's fiery tactics, according the book ''Nixon Off the Record,'' by Monica Crowley, the conservative commentator and onetime Nixon research assistant. ''He's a bomb-thrower -- and we need him,'' Ms. Crowley quoted the former president as saying.
Yet for all his relentless promotion of the right, Mr. Gingrich had also demonstrated his cool calculus in his climb to the top. In 1989, in a hard-fought race for Republican whip, Mr. Gingrich challenged Ed Madigan, who had the backing of another prominent conservative, Tom DeLay, the future Republican leader. Sherwood L. Boehlert, a moderate Republican from upstate New York who is now retired, remembers Mr. Gingrich courting moderates, and promising them a role in leadership if he won. He did, by two votes.
''I always thought of Gingrich as darn near the ultimate pragmatist,'' Mr. Boehlert said.
Those close ties with moderates, and Mr. Gingrich's willingness to compromise with President Bill Clinton, ultimately caused him trouble with his party's right flank, especially the zealous revolutionaries he brought to Washington -- a group much like the Tea Party lawmakers of today. Many found him dismissive and condescending, and viewed his management style as chaotic.
''Gingrich talked a lot about the importance of listening, but he was often not interested in discussing our ideas,'' one member of the freshman class of 1994, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, now a senator, later wrote in a book about his years in Washington, ''Breach of Trust.''
Beyond complaints about style, there were issues of substance. Within Mr. Gingrich's fractious Republican caucus, deficit hawks repeatedly accused him of abandoning their top priority, cutting federal spending. His decision to end the government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996 proved a particular sore point; conservatives said Mr. Gingrich had caved in to a White House that outmaneuvered him.
''He was like a whipped dog who barked, yet still cowered, in Mr. Clinton's presence,'' Mr. Coburn wrote.
In 1997, Mr. Gingrich proposed backing away from a promise he had made in the Contract With America to cut spending on Congressional committees by one third. He said the money was necessary for Congressional oversight of the White House. The rebellious lawmakers balked. Some, including Mr. Graham and Joe Scarborough, now an MSNBC host, demanded that Mr. Gingrich stick to the contract -- or step down. ''Newt's never been a conservative,'' Mr. Scarborough said. ''He is an opportunist.''
On the campaign trail, Mr. Gingrich has said the notion that he is not conservative is ''laughable.'' (The American Conservative Union, an advocacy group, says that during his two decades in Congress Mr. Gingrich voted conservative 90 percent of the time.) His defenders say he was simply engaged in the difficult, sometimes messy, business of governing.
''The reality is that Newt was trying to hold together a very close majority,'' said Bob Walker, a former Republican congressman who remains a close ally of Mr. Gingrich, ''and that meant sometimes you had to do things that were popular across the whole conference, and not just the things that a handful of conservatives wanted.''
But by November 1998, when Republicans lost five seats in the midterm elections, House conservatives were threatening to vote against Mr. Gingrich's re-election as speaker. Concluding that he had become too polarizing to lead, he announced he would quit the speakership, and Congress.
In his headier moments, Mr. Gingrich had boldly proclaimed himself ''the most serious, systematic revolutionary of modern times.'' Now, in his final days on Capitol Hill, he sounded bitter. On the day he announced his resignation from Congress, Mr. Gingrich convened a conference call with fellow Republicans. In it, the leader of the 1994 conservative rebellion blamed the conservatives he had brought to power for his political fall.
''Cannibals,'' Mr. Gingrich called them.

HEADLINE: Fed Unveils Plan to Limit Chance of a Banking Crisis

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve on Tuesday proposed rules that would require the largest American banks to hold more capital -- and to keep it more easily accessible -- to protect against another financial crisis.
But the Fed, the nation's chief banking regulator, added that the final capital rules were unlikely to be more stringent than international limits that were still under development. 
That is a small victory for banks who warned that they would be severely disadvantaged if capital requirements here were stricter than those governing overseas banks. Bank representatives are still wary about details that remain to be worked out, however, including how much of an extra capital cushion would be imposed on the biggest of the big institutions like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.
In a 173-page proposal that tied to the Dodd-Frank regulatory law passed last year, the Fed also proposed formal limits on the amount of credit exposure that a bank holding company can have to any major borrower, be it another bank or corporation.
The goal is to prevent one bank from being susceptible to failure because of a relationship with another large institution. The lack of a cash cushion in the 2008 financial crisis caused many firms to try to rapidly unwind transactions that had troubled institutions on the other side of them, worsening a partner's troubles and accelerating the market's crash.
''A lot of the proposals are built around things that the Federal Reserve and other regulators believe did not work as well as they could leading up to the financial crisis,'' said Deborah P. Bailey, a director in Deloitte & Touche's banking and securities group. Over all, she added, the proposals ''are designed to make sure that banks are strong and won't need government help going forward.''
Of particular interest, she said, are provisions that require large banks to have a stand-alone committee of the board that would work with a company's chief risk officer and be responsible for companywide risk management.
''Clearly that reflects the view that boards need to be more engaged and involved,'' Ms. Bailey said.
Under the proposals, which will be open for public comment until March 31, banks with more than $50 billion in assets would be required, for now, to maintain a cushion equal to 5 percent of assets even during periods of unexpected stress. That standard is up from 4 percent previously and from much lower levels maintained by some large banks during the growth of the housing bubble.
That 5 percent is also the same level that was outlined by the Fed last month when it laid out plans for another round of bank stress tests. But the Fed also warned that banks will be required to match significantly stricter international requirements in the near future, including a larger amount of required capital based on a bank's overall asset size.
The international standards, known as the Basel III accords, are expected to set capital requirements for the largest multinational financial institutions at 7 percent of capital plus a surcharge of up to 2.5 percent depending on a bank's overall risk levels. Those standards are not expected to be phased in until 2016, at the earliest.
The Fed's proposed rules also incorporate triggers intended to provide early warnings that a bank might be sliding into financial trouble. Those triggers would activate restrictions on growth, capital distributions and dividends, as well as limit executive compensation and asset sales.
The Federal Reserve tried in the proposals to address one of the central problems of the financial crisis: the interconnectedness of large financial institutions and its effect on bank stability.
For the roughly 30 banks in the United States with more than $50 billion in assets, the new requirements would limit their credit exposure to a single counterparty to 25 percent of the bank's regulatory capital. The very largest banks face stricter limits of 10 percent of capital for credit exposure between two banks with more than $500 billion in total consolidated assets, or between one bank of that size and a large nonbank financial company.
Currently, there are only a handful of American banks with more than $500 billion in assets including Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. The Fed and other regulators have yet to specify which nonbank financial companies will be treated as systemically important enough to be required to meet the stricter limits on credit exposure.
Individual banks were already subject to some limits on single-borrower lending and investments, but those limits did not apply to bank holding companies. The previous limits also did not account for credit exposures generated by derivatives and other complex transactions.
A trade group representing Wall Street firms and large banks expressed cautious optimism about the proposals, which are subject to revision based on public comments before they are finalized sometime next year.
''We are pleased to see the Fed is taking a phased-in approach to a number of these measures,'' said Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., an executive vice president at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. He said he hoped that the final rules would help ''to ensure the safety and soundness of our financial system while not significantly curtailing the system's ability to contribute to economic growth and job creation.''
Online Correction: December 20, 2011, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article erroneously stated that only four American banks (Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo) had more than $500 billion in assets.

HEADLINE: Putting Paychecks at Risk

 BODY:
If the House had actually voted on Tuesday on the two-month extension of the payroll tax cut in the Senate's bill, there is a chance that it would have passed. There is a chance a truly ugly legislative wreck could have been avoided and that the take-home pay of 160 million workers would not be reduced in less than two weeks. 
But the House refused to vote on the compromise. Instead, it voted on a piece of parliamentary trickery devised by Speaker John Boehner and his lieutenants to ensure the tax cut couldn't possibly pass. The measure simply sent the tax-cut issue back to a nonexistent conference committee. Unlike the bipartisan Senate vote, this one was supported only by Republicans and was designed to produce only one possible outcome.
As a result, it looks increasingly likely that the payroll tax cut will end on Jan. 1, along with extended unemployment insurance for three million jobless workers. After the vote, President Obama urged Mr. Boehner and House Republicans to put politics aside and extend the tax cut for two months while negotiators work on making it last for a full year. But he was immediately repudiated by Mr. Boehner, appearing with his caucus, who said the Senate would have to return to Washington and negotiate.
In a year full of dangerous standoffs, led by extremist House members, this one may be the most intractable.
Many House Republicans never wanted the president's tax-cut proposal to pass, in part because it might contribute to economic growth in an election year. But they could not be seen as voting against it, so they used one of Congress's many methods to kill a bill without appearing to have done so. Earlier in the month, they passed a one-year extension full of provisions designed to sink it, including big cuts to discretionary spending, a significant reduction to jobless benefits and utterly irrelevant provisions allowing industries to spew more pollution and forcing a decision on the Keystone XL oil pipeline.
They wanted the Senate to vote down that bill so the House wouldn't be blamed. Instead, the Senate approved a two-month extension, hoping to use that time to reach agreement on how to pay for the next 10 months. The blame has returned to the House side.
Assigning blame, or avoiding it, has come to replace actual governing in the Congress. If the tax cut dies, Democrats will accuse Republicans of killing it, and they will be absolutely right to do so. It might even help them regain the House next year among an electorate disgusted with partisan gridlock. But the cost to individual families and the nation is too high a price to pay.
The House may well back down; several Senate Republicans are urging them to. But if Mr. Boehner refuses to bend, as painful as it will be, Mr. Obama will have to ask the Senate in the next few days to return to Washington and negotiate with the House. It may not do any good, but there are too many paychecks at stake to give up.

HEADLINE: For Older Runners, Good News and Bad

BYLINE: GRETCHEN REYNOLDS


HIGHLIGHT: Runners over 60 were just as efficient as younger runners, even those in their 20s, though they are more prone to injuries. 

 BODY:
Sometimes it's good news when a study's hypothesis is not proved. That was the case, certainly, with a new study of older runners, in which researchers assumed that athletes over 60 would be noticeably less efficient than their younger counterparts.
For the experiment, published in The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, researchers at the University of New Hampshire and other institutions recruited 51 competitive runners, ranging in age from 18 to 77. Each trained regularly and had placed in the top three in his or her age group in a local 5-kilometer or 10-kilometer road race. Their goal was to assess running economy, a measure of how much oxygen someone uses to run at a certain pace. Economical runners can continue at a given speed longer than inefficient striders, outdistancing them.
Going into the study, the researchers had assumed that runners past age 60 would be less economical than youthful athletes, since older runners, as a group, are slower than younger ones. But as it turned out, when scientists fitted the volunteers with masks that measured their oxygen use as they ran on a treadmill and then compared the results by age group, the runners 60 and older were just as physiologically economical as younger runners, even those in their 20s and 30s.
"It was quite a surprise," said Timothy Quinn, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Hampshire and lead author of the study. "Economical runners perform better than less-economical runners. And contrary to our expectations, economy did not decline with age." The results are encouraging for older runners, he continued, suggesting that aging lungs and leg muscles have no trouble using oxygen efficiently, and that older runners can still be fast.
Masters runners and, in particular, those 60 and older are the fastest-growing group in the sport, according to most statistics. A recent study of the New York City Marathon from 1980 to 2009, for example, found that "the percent of finishers younger than 40 years significantly decreased, while the percent of masters runners significantly increased for both males and females," said Romuald Lepers, a professor of sports sciences at the University of Burgundy in France who, with his colleague Thomas Cattagni, conducted the study.
In the coming weeks, thanks to New Year's resolutions, many more of us are likely to swell the ranks of well-seasoned runners.
But science is only starting to systematically study older runners, and not everything that is being learned is encouraging. For instance, a sobering examination of running injuries, published in Current Sports Medicine Reports, found that middle-aged and older runners are much more prone to problems with Achilles tendons and hamstring and calf muscles than their whippersnapper counterparts. A possible explanation for the high rate of such injuries among the post-40 set, the study authors speculate, is that the normal muscle wear and tear "that occurs with training seems to take greater time to repair with aging, and older runners continue running at a frequency similar to that of younger runners."
So much for age conferring patience and wisdom.
Dr. Quinn's group, too, found that some physiological parameters did worsen with age. Older runners scored poorly on tests of upper-body strength and lower-body flexibility, both of which can affect the ability to compete.
"You need upper-body strength to pump your arms and generate power and velocity, especially on hills," Dr. Quinn said. Similarly, flexible tendons and muscles in the lower leg allow full, easy strides. "We didn't measure step length," he said, "but my guess is that it was shorter" among the runners who were 60 or older. With tighter tissues, older runners are constrained to choppy strides and, in general, a slower pace.
Happily, Dr. Quinn says, these particular physical detriments can be improved. "Older runners should try very hard to get to the gym to lift weights a few times a week," he said. Concentrate on exercises that build upper-body strength. The sexagenarian and older runners in his study had almost as much leg strength as younger runners, he says, but far less muscle mass, strength and power in their arms and shoulders.
Stretch occasionally after a run, too, he advises. It's not as clear that flexibility aids in running performance among older runners, he says. But to help maintain speed, "it's probably not a bad idea to work on lower-body flexibility, especially if you used to be more flexible."
Should you need further inspiration, consider another finding of the study of older New York City marathon racers. The researchers report that in recent years, the average finishing time for the fastest men 60 and older dropped by more than seven minutes; among older women, it plummeted by more than 16 minutes. And the improvements show no sign of slowing. Older runners "have probably not yet reached their limits in marathon performance," Dr. Lepers says, which is worth bearing in mind as you set your 2012 exercise goals.

BYLINE: NELL DICKERSON


HIGHLIGHT: How Mississippi's abandoned antebellum mansions give insight into the Civil War. 

 BODY:
Perhaps the most famous house of 1861 was, by July of that year, no longer standing. The home, called Spring Hill, belonged to Judith Henry, an invalid widow, and stood on a hill overlooking Bull Run. In the battle that engulfed the fields around Spring Hill on July 21, Henry was killed and her home destroyed, save for a few remnant beams and a section of chimney.
Over the next four years of war, countless thousands of homes, from grand mansions to decrepit shacks, would be damaged or destroyed. Many others were simply abandoned by fleeing families, never to be reclaimed. What was left behind was a landscape of human ruin, some of it still standing today, 150 years later.
Growing up in Mississippi, I was surrounded by such structures, and was particularly drawn to those that survived the war more or less intact, but remained abandoned to social and economic neglect. As a young adult, I went to my cousin-in-law, Shelby Foote, for advice on how to help preserve the antebellum architecture of the South. He suggested I start at his birthplace, Washington County, in the heart of the Mississippi Delta. He put me in touch with a friend of his, a local historian, who opened a world of narratives about the local characters and their homes. What had seemed mysteriously inaccessible was suddenly opened to me. 
The story of the Burrus house, in Benoit, was of particular interest, and I decided to launch my journey there. I drove south from Memphis via Highway 1, coursing along the eastern banks of the Mississippi River for about 160 miles, finally arriving at the home of Eustace Winn, an elderly doctor, in Greenville, the closest city to Benoit. I had no trouble finding his house, as he told me to look for the one "with a bunch of Cadillacs in the carport." It wasn't hard to miss it in this mostly modest neighborhood.
Dr. Winn, a descendant of J.C. Burrus, the original owner of the Burrus house, invited me in. Although I declined lunch, I couldn't resist his offer of key lime pie, homemade, apparently, in honor of a stranger's visit. He told me his family's history, and about their grand antebellum house, set on their cotton plantation near the county line just north of Greenville. 
In the mid-1850s, Dr. Winn's ancestors were so prosperous from cotton that they "sent for a New Orleans architect," the ultimate sign of prestige. "In those days," he said, "the architect lived on the job site and oversaw the construction work. He used timbers hand-hewn from the local Cypress trees on the place. That's why the house has remained standing for so long." 
The army of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman came through in 1863, burning and ransacking plantation homes along the way. But the Burrus house was saved, Dr. Winn said, "because the Yankee officer in charge had gone to school at the University of Virginia with my great-grandfather." 
Of course, as in all antebellum houses, someone famous hid in the attic. In this case, the Confederate general Jubal Anderson Early took refuge there on his flight to Mexico after The War ended. 
Although the house survived the war, it fell on harder times in the 20th century. No one in the doctor's family wanted to live so far from town, and he didn't have the resources to keep it up. "I'll sell it you for six dollars," he said, "if you promise to restore it." 
"I'll take a look at it," I replied as I licked the whipped cream from the corners of my mouth. 
As it turns out, this antebellum house has a more recent legacy as well. It is most famous for being the set for the 1956 film "Baby Doll," directed by Elia Kazan. Tennessee Williams wrote the screenplay (his first) and lived there during the shooting. Actually, the house was more than a set; it was the main character, because it was dilapidated even then. The grand old place stole every scene - gothic and haunted, even then. 
After our visit, I headed north to the tiny town of Benoit and followed Dr. Winn's directions to the house, hidden off the road on a working farm. The caretaker expected me. Several dogs and a few horses followed me around the property as I surveyed the exterior. I noticed that the two-story front porch was missing, but later found it carefully reclining in the parlor, recuperating after a tornado blew it down.
The house was unique because it had a grand, circular stair in the entry. It had double parlors and several other rooms downstairs with bedrooms upstairs, and an attic for hiding Confederates on the run. I felt welcome there, as if the house wanted me to photograph it to tell its story. (Five years later, on another shooting trip, I was elated to see the beginning of restoration in progress. Two more years passed when I received an unexpected email from the doctor's grandson and namesake, Eustace H. Winn IV: "We are almost finished. You would not recognize the place.")
I continued the project for another six years, traveling around the region to photograph buildings constructed before 1861. They tended to be isolated in the woods or on remote farms. My work took me across the Mississippi River valley, through Mississippi, Tennessee, Louisiana and Missouri. Occasionally I came across an abandoned church or a long-forgotten commercial building, but I let the River be my guide. These structures were built in support of "King Cotton," and it is cotton's cruel legacy that is the foundation of the Civil War. 
Shelby Foote explained the history of cotton and the Delta so eloquently in "Pillar of Fire," a story about a company of Union soldiers dispatched to burn the first house they come to while patrolling the Mississippi River. He understood that, for all the historical research available on the war, to really understand it, you have to understand the lives of the people who fought in it. And to understand the people who helped drive the South to secede and then fight, there's no better place to start than the houses they built - and left behind.

HEADLINE: Here Come the Tour Buses, Minus the Loudspeakers, and Maybe Human Guides

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A new city law requiring tour bus companies to equip passengers with headphones to hear sightseeing spiels may bring the layoff of flesh-and-blood tour guides. 

 BODY:
By the city's count, affirmed with a touch of official hokum in Times Square on Tuesday, a record number of tourists,50.2 million, will have visited New York City by the time 2011 gasps its last in 10 days. 
New Yorkers, especially people living in certain parts of Manhattan, will tell you that every single one of those 50.2 million rides through their neighborhoods aboard the inescapable red or blue double-decker tour buses. It isn't true, of course. But it does sometimes seem that way.
In Greenwich Village, where streets are narrow and streaks of independence broad, residents consider themselves especially put upon. When the open-air buses lumber through, with tour guides spreading information and occasional misinformation through loudspeakers, village people can feel as if their living rooms have been invaded.
"There's nothing as intrusive as this except for motorcycles and emergency vehicle sirens," Cormac Flynn, who lives on West Eighth Street, told a City Council committee hearing last year. He has a fifth-floor apartment. His living room is set well back from the front of the apartment. Even so, Mr. Flynn said, "we have to stop, give up trying to hear what they're saying on television because there's a tour bus stuck outside of our house."
Grievances of this sort led to a new city law last year requiring the tour bus industry - which essentially meansGray Line New York Sightseeing (red) and CitySights NY (blue) - to equip passengers with headphones that confine the guide's spiel to their ears only. This change is to be phased in on all buses over five years.
But there is a natural law that is more powerful. It's the one governing unintended consequences. 
Tour guides say that Gray Line is using the headphone requirement as a pretext to get rid of them. The company, they say, informed them that the new system would be expensive to install and that there would have to be layoffs to help pay for it. Instead of flesh-and-blood guides, automated recordings would be piped into the headphones telling visitors that up ahead is Riverside Church and that Gracie Mansion is named for George Burns's wife. (O.K., maybe that second one isn't part of the tour. Just wanted to see if you were paying attention.)
Replacing guides with machines is not the purpose of the legislation, said Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer, who was its guiding force. 
"Unfortunately, the law is being used as an excuse to undermine the employment security of the tour guides and, in turn, the safety and security of passengers on sightseeing buses," Ms. Brewer, of Manhattan, wrote this month to Jonathan Mintz, the city's consumer affairs commissioner.
In an interview on Tuesday, she said, "You need the nuances of a human being to make the tour an enjoyable experience."
A labor leader said that at one point the company suggested it would do away with all but three dozen of its 159 licensed tour guides. Then the word was that far fewer heads would roll but that salaries would be cut by 25 percent, and 20 buses would be converted to an automated system in the new year.
By now, "it gets so complicated that even I don't understand it," said the labor official, Robert Murphy, a shop steward with Local 225 of the Transport Workers Union. We would love to offer clarification from Gray Line, but its officials did not return several calls.
It is the nature of New Yorkers to grumble about tourists for an assortment of sins, like walking four abreast, clogging sidewalks and forcing the locals to move at a maddeningly slow pace. But there is no underestimating the visitors' importance to the city's economic health. They spend a lot of money, $32 billion this year, City Hall said. So attention must be paid.
Bear in mind, Mr. Murphy said, that sightseeing bus guides like him get the visitors out of Times Square and into other neighborhoods.
 "We're the ones who distribute the tourist dollar," he said.

 BODY:
Is it 2012 yet? From where I sit, the Great Recession has felt like the movie "Groundhog Day," in which Bill Murray relives the same miserable day over and over again. For those of us waiting for the business-for-sale marketplace to turn the corner, 2012 brings a number of reasons for hope, many of which are addressed in a just-publishedNew York Times article. While the decision to sell your business should be entered into with careful thought and planning, here are five reasons you may want to get a deal done by the end of 2012.
1. Expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts.
As the article spells out in detail, the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts could have a significant affect on the after-tax proceeds of a business that is sold after 2012. While you're getting your books in order and scheduling a year-end meeting with your accountant, make a note to ask about the tax savings associated with selling your business in 2012 versus waiting another year or two. If you're on the fence, the answer to this question may point to a decision.
2. This was a good year for many small businesses.
I have spoken with several small-business owners whose sales and income numbers have finally returned to pre-recession levels. Businesses in the construction, leisure and entertainment, and Internet industries saw a solid upswing, to name a few. With expenses cut to the bone in an effort to survive the past three years, many businesses are lean, mean and ready for buyer scrutiny.
One thing to keep in mind is that small-business valuations are not what they were. "Don't make the mistake of asking pre-recession prices," said Mike Handelsman, group general manager for BizBuySell and BizQuest, in a recent article. "Buyers will often have no problem paying for a strong business, but they will still scoff at overvalued listings."
3. There's still plenty of money on the sidelines.
The buyers are out there! Corporate buyers and private equity groups in particular are sitting on record amounts of cash and looking to put it to use through strategic acquisitions and investments. Meanwhile, many owners of middle-market businesses (defined as having at least $2 million in pretax earnings) have been waiting until the economy improves to go to market. Bolstered by stronger management and more access to capital than their Main Street counterparts, many of these businesses have remained robust throughout the recession. If you own a healthy and profitable middle-market business, 2012 will continue to be a seller's market for you. Even at the Main Street level, my firm represented more individual buyers looking to leave corporate America behind and purchase an existing business in 2011 than ever before. The problem for Main Street continues to be the availability of traditional bank lending for small-business acquisitions.
4. The market may be flooded soon.
With Baby Boomers retiring en masse over the next 15 years, a lot of business owners will be heading for the exit. There are predictions that this will put a damper on small-business valuations, as the supply of businesses will outweigh demand. Whether or not you sell in 2012, you should start planning now to position your business for sale in what could become a crowded and competitive marketplace.
5. It may be time to get on with your life.
Many business owners who were looking to sell over the last three years have had to put their lives on hold, shift into survival mode and weather the economic storm. For these folks, the opportunity to cash out at a decent price and move on will be more than welcome.
While 2012 may be a good time for many business owners to sell, that's not to suggest that you should try to market-time a sale, something merger and acquisition professionals like Gary Brooks -- president of Exit Plan Pros -- caution against. "Those sellers who tried to time the market were completely surprised at how quick the market dried up in 2008," said Mr. Brooks. "I have a client that turned down an offer for $11 million in 1999 because he thought that expansion would go on for a few more years. We had another offer for $6.5 million in 2007, and now the business is worth $2 million or $3 million."
Whether the coming year breathes fresh air into what has been a stagnant market remains to be seen. If you do plan to sell, keep in mind that it typically takes aboutayear to complete a transaction. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to get a deal closed by the end of 2012.
Are you thinking of selling? If so, how does the market look to you?

HEADLINE: Mercedes-Benz Introduces Gas and Diesel E-Class Hybrids

BYLINE: PAUL STENQUIST


HIGHLIGHT: Both models will have their formal introductions at the Detroit auto show in January. 

 BODY:
On Wednesday, Mercedes-Benz announced two new hybrid E-Class sedans. The E300 BlueTec Hybrid is equipped with a diesel-electric powertrain, the automaker's first to be commercialized, while the E400 Hybrid has a more conventional gas-electric hybrid system.
Mercedes-Benz said the diesel hybrid would be available only in Europe, at least initially. But given the presence of BlueTec models in the United States, as well as the automaker's investments in so-called clean-diesel technology, few would be surprised if the oil-burning model came to North America.
The E300 BlueTec Hybrid combines a 201-horsepower 4-cylinder diesel engine with a 27-horsepower electric motor and can reportedly travel an estimated 100 kilometers on just 4.2 liters of diesel fuel, or roughly 56 miles per gallon. A stop-start function and regenerative braking also contribute to the car's fuel efficiency. The combined torque of the diesel engine and the electric motor is expected to rival the level of twist produced by the brand's high-performance V-8s.
The E400 Hybrid, which is scheduled to be delivered to dealerships in the United States in the second half of 2012, combines a 302-horsepower direct-injection V-6 gasoline engine with a 27-horsepower electric motor to achieve a combined fuel economy of about 27 m.p.g. Like the diesel version, it is equipped with a stop-start function and mild regenerative braking.
Both hybrid powertrains were described by Mercedes as modular, an indication that they could potentially be fitted to other vehicle platforms.
"With these two E-Class models we are now continuing our comprehensive hybrid offensive," said Thomas Weber, a Daimler board member and head of Mercedes-Benz car development. "The modular technology opens up a quick way for us to complement other model series with hybrid models."
Both cars are scheduled to be formally introduced at the Detroit auto show, where press previews begin on Jan. 9. The price premium for the hybrids over their conventional gas-burning and BlueTec diesel equivalents was not announced, but Mercedes described the extra cost as "only moderate."

HEADLINE: Food Gifts That Matter

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: For the charity-minded, worthwhile causes in the food world. 

 BODY:
My column today offers suggestions for gifts for non-cooks. Obviously, cooking is not the only issue out there, and direct contact with friends is not the only way to change things in the food world: there is cash. There are countless worthy causes and just as many charitable institutions. If finding the cash to spare is difficult so, too, may be choosing where it will be put to best use. But if you're thinking about making a donation this year to brighten the national or global food landscape, here's a list of organizations where your gifts will be well spent. (No doubt there are equally worthy omissions; add them in the comments section.)

        
Trickle Up: Helps people living on less than $1.25 a day to lift themselves out of poverty by providing them with seed capital grants, community savings groups to help build their assets, and training for how to operate and grow a microenterprise.

        
Oxfam: Works to end poverty and injustice in America and the rest of the world. Oxfam International has a particularly interesting blog written and edited by Duncan Green, head of research for Oxfam Great Britain. Also consider WhyHunger and Action Against Hunger.

        
Heifer International: Helps families around the world feed themselves and gain access to sustainable means of income through gifts of livestock and training.

        
Bread for the World: Lobbies U.S. political leaders - hard and effectively - to make addressing world hunger a national priority.

        
Doctors Without Borders: Treats, among many others in desperate need, those suffering from severe malnutrition.

        
Growing Power: Develops community-based food systems by training community members to sustainably, grow, process, market and distribute food. Its founder, Will Allen, is one of the more inspiring and gifted figures in the "good food movement" - or whatever you choose to call it - and a pioneer in the field of urban agriculture.

        
Environmental Working Group: Promotes agricultural conservation, protects public health and exposes the federal policies that damage either one. Among many other contributions, EWG brings us the U.S. farm subsidy database, and the "Clean 15" and "Dirty Dozen" lists, rankings of the best and worst produce based on exposure to pesticides.

        
Coalition of Immokalee Workers: Fights for fair wages, better treatment, better housing and greater respect for low-wage immigrant farm workers in Florida. CIW also works for stronger laws and enforcement protecting workers' rights and the right to organize.

        
The Humane Society of the United States: Advocates for the rights of animals, most notably - when it comes to changing the U.S. food system - by exposing the horrific, and all-too-routine animal abuses that have come to define industrial animal agriculture.

        
Let's Move Salad Bars to Schools: Increases schoolchildren's access to, and consumption of, fruits and vegetables by supporting and installing salad bars in schools across the U.S. This is one of Let's Move's most direct initiatives to address childhood obesity.

        
Wholesome Wave: Its Double Value Coupon Program - now in over 200 markets in 23 states - doubles the value of federal nutrition assistance dollars - like SNAP and WIC - at participating farmers markets, making local fruits and vegetables more accessible to low-income Americans.

        
Meals on Wheels: Works to end senior hunger in the U.S.

        
Share Our Strength: Works to end childhood hunger in the U.S.

Food Bank of New York City: New York's preeminent hunger relief organization, tackling food poverty through distribution, income support and nutrition education.
        
City Harvest: Rescues over 83,000 pounds of food every day, and distributes it to nearly 600 community programs. Instead of - or in addition to - donating funds, you can also donate food.

        
People's Grocery: Improves the economy and health of West Oakland by addressing the local food system and increasing access to healthy foods. Its work has served as a model for like-minded organizations across the country. (Here's an interesting interview with Nikki Henderson, of People's Grocery, and Alice Waters.)

        
Food Corps: Sends service members to limited-resource communities around the U.S. to build and tend school gardens, implement nutrition education programs and bring healthy, local food to school cafeterias.

        
Slow Food USA: Promotes food that's healthy for the people who eat and grow it, and for the environment in which it's grown. Slow Food USA also recently issued the $5 Challenge, a heartening charge for home cooks to reclaim the value meal from fast food.

        
Food Democracy Now!: Organizes online campaigns and on-the-ground actions to replace the broken food system with a more sustainable one.

        
National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition: Works to protect and promote federal agricultural policies that benefit local food systems, rural communities, family farmers and environmentally responsible practices.

        
American Farmland Trust: Saves America's productive farm and ranch land from development. No farms, no food.

        
The Land Institute: Works to develop and promote an ecologically stable system of perennial agriculture with grain yields comparable to - and inputs less than - traditional annual monoculture.

        
Oceana: Quite simply, strives to protect the oceans in every way imaginable, as evidenced by its extensive list of victories won over the past eight years.

        
Just Food: Works to ensure that every neighborhood in New York City has the resources it needs to make fresh, local food accessible to all of its residents.

HEADLINE: Sports, It Seems, Explains Recent Skirmishes in Cable Industry

BYLINE: AMY CHOZICK


HIGHLIGHT: Fees for sports programming keep going up, in part because fans are so loyal. And a recent ruling against Comcast could pave the way for more sports channels. Where will it all end? 

 BODY:
The battle between sports programming and cable providers continues to heat up. Are consumers on the losing team?
A decision this week by an administrative judge at the Federal Communications Commission would force Comcast to carry the Tennis Channel more widely. Meanwhile, a heated fight over so-called carriage fees between Time Warner Cable and the New York sports network MSG has erupted. (Both parties have even started grass-roots campaigns to warn New Yorkers that the other party is trying to take their beloved sports away.)
The French Open and the New York Knicks games might not have much in common, but the Tennis Channel and MSG symbolize a simmering debate within the cable industry over how to handle specialty sports channels. Sports - whether golf, hockey or the most-coveted of all, N.F.L. football - represents that rare programming gold mine. A devoted audience still watches in hordes, often without the DVR. Many cable subscribers simply couldn't live without sports.
But what if you're the customer who isn't a sports fan? Or, what if you want tennis and not football? (If this is the case, you probably don't live in Texas.)
Comcast and Time Warner Cable have tried to come up with more economical basic-cable packages that don't include ESPN and other specialty sports channels. But the Tennis Channel ruling (which Comcast is appealing) could set a precedent that makes cable operators carry niche sports channels on widely distributed tiers of service.
The Tennis Channel said Comcast discriminated against it in favor of its own products, Versus sports network and the Golf Channel (another channel some households would pay extra for and others would equate with watching paint dry). Comcast said it kept the Tennis Channel off basic service to keep customer costs down. A judge ruled in the Tennis Channel's favor and ordered Comcast to pay a $375,000 fine.
In New York, MSG, which broadcasts Rangers and Knicks games, as well as sports in the Buffalo area, said it wanted "fair and reasonable rates" from Time Warner Cable. Time Warner Cable said the 53 percent increase in cable fees MSG is requesting would make it "the most expensive sports network in the country."
If the two parties don't reach an agreement, subscribers will lose MSG - whether they like it or not - on Dec. 31.
All this may seem like the little leagues compared with ESPN, or the nine-year, $27 billion deal the N.F.L. just struck with NBC, CBS and Fox. But all these skirmishes could signal a larger battle, as more sports teams or leagues consider starting their own cable channels. They have a little more clout now to demand that cable operators carry a specialty sports channel.
The N.F.L. and N.H.L. networks already have wide carriage on Comcast.
A result of the proliferation of sports on cable may be that consumers demand packages without sports, or cable providers inch toward a la carte pricing structure. Imagine going through a laundry list of channels and checking on the NHL or NFL networks but crossing off others you didn't want to pay for. This type of pricing is unlikely, since cable providers say it would inevitably cost more.
For now, the fights between sports and cable operators are serving as their own spectator sport.

HEADLINE: What if We Occupied Language?

BYLINE: H. SAMY ALIM


HIGHLIGHT: A movement that challenges the power structure of language could help foster the sort of equality the protests aim to achieve. 

 BODY:
When I flew out from the San Francisco airport last October, we crossed above the ports that Occupy Oakland helped shut down, and arrived in Germany to be met by traffic caused by Occupy Berlin protestors. But the movement has not only transformed public space, it has transformed the public discourse as well.
It is now nearly impossible to hear the word and not think of the Occupy movement.
Even as distinguished an expert as the lexicographer and columnist Ben Zimmer admitted as much this week: "occupy, " he said, is the odds-on favorite to be chosen as the American Dialect Society's Word of the Year.
It has already succeeded in shifting the terms of the debate, taking phrases like "debt-ceiling" and "budget crisis" out of the limelight and putting terms like "inequality" and "greed" squarely in the center. This discursive shift has made it more difficult for Washington to continue to promote the spurious reasons for the financial meltdown and the unequal outcomes it has exposed and further produced.

To most, the irony of a progressive social movement using the term "occupy" to reshape how Americans think about issues of democracy and equality has been clear. After all, it is generally nations, armies and police who occupy, usually by force. And in this, the United States has been a leader. The American government is just now after nine years ending its overt occupation of Iraq, is still entrenched in Afghanistan and is maintaining troops on the ground in dozens of countries worldwide. All this is not to obscure the fact that the United States as we know it came into being by way of an occupation - a gradual and devastatingly violent one that all but extinguished entire Native American populations across thousands of miles of land.
Yet in a very short time, this movement has dramatically changed how we think about occupation. In early September, "occupy" signaled on-going military incursions. Now it signifies progressive political protest. It's no longer primarily about force of military power; instead it signifies standing up to injustice, inequality and abuse of power. It's no longer about simply occupying a space; it's about transforming that space.
In this sense, Occupy Wall Street has occupied language, has made "occupy" its own. And, importantly, people from diverse ethnicities, cultures and languages have participated in this linguistic occupation - it is distinct from the history of forcible occupation in that it is built to accommodate all, not just the most powerful or violent. 
As Geoff Nunberg, the long-time chair of the usage panel for American Heritage Dictionary, and others have explained, the earliest usage of occupy in English that was linked to protest can be traced to English media descriptions of Italian demonstrations in the 1920s, in which workers "occupied" factories until their demands were met. This is a far cry from some of its earlier meanings. In fact, The Oxford English Dictionary tells us that "occupy" once meant "to have sexual intercourse with." One could imagine what a phrase like "Occupy Wall Street" might have meant back then.
In October, Zimmer, who is also the chair of the American Dialect Society's New Word Committee, noted on NPR's "On the Media" that the meaning of occupy has changed dramatically since its arrival into the English language in the 14th century. "It's almost always been used as a transitive verb," Zimmer said. "That's a verb that takes an object, so you occupy a place or a space. But then it became used as a rallying cry, without an object, just to mean to take part in what are now called the Occupy protests. It's being used as a modifier - Occupy protest, Occupy movement. So it's this very flexible word now that's filling many grammatical slots in the language."
What if we transformed the meaning of occupy yet again? Specifically, what if we thought of Occupy Language as more than the language of the Occupy movement, and began to think about it as a movement in and of itself? What kinds of issues would Occupy Language address? What would taking language back from its self-appointed "masters" look like? We might start by looking at these questions from the perspective of race and discrimination, and answer with how to foster fairness and equality in that realm.
Occupy Language might draw inspiration from both the way that the Occupy movement has reshaped definitions of "occupy," which teaches us that we give words meaning and that discourses are not immutable, from the way indigenous movements have contested its use, which teaches us to be ever-mindful about how language both empowers and oppresses, unifies and isolates.
For starters, Occupy Language might first look inward. In a recent interview, Julian Padilla of the People of Color Working Group pushed the Occupy movement to examine its linguistic choices:
To occupy means to hold space, and I think a group of anti-capitalists holding space on Wall Street is powerful, but I do wish the NYC movement would change its name to "'decolonise Wall Street"' to take into account history, indigenous critiques, people of colour and imperialism Occupying space is not inherently bad, it's all about who and how and why. When white colonizers occupy land, they don't just sleep there over night, they steal and destroy. When indigenous people occupied Alcatraz Island it was (an act of) protest. 
This linguistic change can remind Americans that a majority of the 99 percent has benefited from the occupation of native territories.
Occupy Language might also support the campaign to stop the media from using the word "illegal" to refer to "undocumented" immigrants. From the campaign's perspective, only inanimate objects and actions are labeled illegal in English; therefore the use of "illegals" to refer to human beings is dehumanizing. The New York Times style book currently asks writers to avoid terms like "illegal alien" and "undocumented," but says nothing about "illegals." Yet The Times' standards editor, Philip B. Corbett, did recently weigh in on this, saying that the term "illegals" has an "unnecessarily pejorative tone" and that "it's wise to steer clear."
Pejorative, discriminatory language can have real life consequences. In this case, activists worry about the coincidence of the rise in the use of the term "illegals" and the spike in hate crimes against all Latinos. As difficult as it might be to prove causation here, the National Institute for Latino Policy reports that the F.B.I.'s annual Hate Crime Statistics show that Latinos comprised of the victims of ethnically motivated hate crimes in 2010. When some is repeatedly described as some, language has quietly paved the way for violent action.
But Occupy Language should concern itself with more than just the words we use; it should also work towards eliminating language-based racism and discrimination. In the legal system, CNN recently reported that the U.S. Justice Department alleges that Arizona's infamous Sheriff Joe Arpaio, among other offenses, has discriminated against "Latino inmates with limited English by punishing them and denying critical services." In education, as linguistic anthropologist Ana Celia Zentella notes, hostility towards those who speak "English with an accent" (Asians, Latinos, and African Americans) continues to be a problem. In housing, The National Fair Housing Alliance has long recognized "accents" as playing a significant role in housing discrimination. On the job market, language-based discrimination intersects with issues of race, ethnicity, class and national origin to make it more difficult for well-qualified applicants with an "accent" to receive equal opportunities.
In the face of such widespread language-based discrimination, Occupy Language can be a critical, progressive linguistic movement that exposes how language is used as a means of social, political and economic control. By occupying language, we can expose how educational, political, and social institutions use language to further marginalize oppressed groups; resist colonizing language practices that elevate certain languages over others; resist attempts to define people with terms rooted in negative stereotypes; and begin to reshape the public discourse about our communities, and about the central role of language in racism and discrimination.
As the global Occupy movement has shown, words can move entire nations of people - even the world - to action. Occupy Language, as a movement, should speak to the power of language to transform how we think about the past, how we act in the present, and how we envision the future.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Compensation Over Time

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Easier eligibility and the weak economy have increased the percentage of jobless receiving unemployment insurance, making that particular economic benefit a larger piece of the economy, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The propensity of unemployed people to receive unemployment benefits reached historical highs after the 2008-9 recession and may indicate that benefit rules have more impact on the economy than ever before. The changing aggregate impact of unemployment insurance may be worth considering as Congress debates benefit extensions.
Unemployment insurance offers funds, for a limited eligibility period (now up to 99 weeks), to "covered" people who lost their jobs and have yet been unable to find and start a new job.
Some economists suggest that unemployment insurance prolongs unemployment because recipients have to give up their benefits as soon as they find and start a new job, or return to working at a previous job.
Some economists also say they believe that unemployment insurance stimulates spending because unemployed people are thought to spend most, if not all, of the money they have on hand.
But neither of these effects can operate unless people take part in the program.
Historically, many of the jobless have not collected unemployment benefits because of ineligibility, lack of awareness or unwillingness to do so.
The chart below graphs the recipiency rate -- the percentage of people unemployed who are collecting unemployment benefits that week -- to 1986. It was calculated from weekly data, then averaged over 52 weeks to remove some of the large seasonalpatterns.
The percentage is always well under 100, fluctuating from 31 to 68 percent. The peak recipiency rates seem to follow recessions; three national recessions have occurred since 1986, in 1990-91, 2001 and 2008-9. Previous studies covering the period 1960-94 found a similar pattern (although perhaps no recipiency rate peak was found after the 1981-82 recession), with a maximum recipiency rate for all 35 years of about 50 percent.
Some unemployed people cannot collect benefits because they quit their jobs, rather than being laid off. But quits are less common during recessions, one reason the recipiency rate is greatest during recessions.
Another reason that recessions can have high recipiency rates is that, by law, benefit eligibility periods are longer during recessions. Laws often increase the eligibility periods by a greater percentage than the average duration of unemployment increases, with the result that a larger percentage of the unemployed are eligible for benefits.
Among other things, the 2009 American Reinvestment and Reinvestment Act expanded eligibility for unemployment insurance by encouraging states to adopt an "alternative base period" benefit calculation rule that allowed a number of people with weak employment histories to qualify for benefits.
Long-term comparisons of recipiency rates are tricky because the data sources change and because of secular changes in the composition of unemployed, but it appears that recipiency rates were higher during 2009 than they have been in 50 years, and perhaps ever.
With such a large percentage of unemployed people receiving benefits, the potential employment and spending effects of those benefits may be greater than ever.

HEADLINE: Hacked Chamber of Commerce Opposed Cybersecurity Law

BYLINE: NICOLE PERLROTH


HIGHLIGHT: The breach at the Chamber of Commerce is, in some ways, a twist of fate for the Chamber. It has been one of the more vocal critics of cybersecurity legislation. Earlier this year, the Chamber criticized the White House's legislative proposals on cybersecurity as "regulatory overreach" and cautioned that "layering new regulations on critical infrastructure will harm public-private partnerships." 

 BODY:
The United States Chamber of Commerce has confirmed Chinese hackers last year broke into internal networks.
The breach is, in some ways, a twist of fate for the Chamber. It has been one of the more vocal critics of cybersecurity legislation. In an internal draft document circulated earlier this year, the Chamber criticized the White House's legislative proposals on cybersecurity as "regulatory overreach" and cautioned that "layering new regulations on critical infrastructure will harm public-private partnerships."
"This happens all the time," says Tom Kellermann, chief technology officer at AirPatrol Corp. and a member of a Center for Strategic International Studies panel set up to advise President Obama on cybersecurity. "This is essentially the modus operandi of China's economic espionage campaign. Hackers use a trade group as a beachhead to compromise the constituency. What intellectual property does the Chamber have? They don't. But they're trusted."
The Federal Bureau of Investigation was the first to alert the business lobbying group that servers in China were accessing the Chamber's internal network early last year. A subsequent internal investigation found the hackers had zeroed in on four of the lobbying group's Asia policy experts and that at least six week's worth of e-mails had been pilfered. The Chamber shut down the operation in May 2010.
J.P. Fielder, a Chamber spokesman, emphasized that the breach was "limited in scope" to the four employees, though an earlier report in the Wall Street Journal suggested that the breach had been going on for over a year before it was discovered and that more than 300 Internet addresses may have been compromised. The F.B.I. did not return calls seeking comment.
 The Chamber represents businesses and trade groups in Washington and the breach may affect its trusted relationship with its three million members, which include some of the nation's largest corporations.
 "Businesses are already worried about the cyber theft of their internal trade secrets. Now they have to worry that the sensitive information they've shared with the Chamber is compromised," says Jacob Olcott, a principal with Good Harbor Consulting's cybersecurity team.
The Chamber says it has taken greater steps to secure itself in the wake of the breach. Mr. Fielder, the Chamber spokesman, said the Chamber had installed more sophisticated detection equipment and updated its policies which now include "barring employees from taking portable devices with them to certain countries," including China.
Despite these measures, the Chamber still shows signs of infiltration. The Journal reported that the Chamber recently discovered a thermostat in a Chamber-owned apartment was communicating with an Internet address in China and that last March, one of its printers randomly started printing documents containing Chinese characters.
An earlier version of this post referred imprecisely to a cybersecurity committee that Tom Kellermann is a member of. The panel was set up by a private policy research organization, the Center for Strategic International Studies, to advise President Obama. It is not a presidential commission.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Issues Limits on Mercury Emissions

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: "By cutting emissions that are linked to developmental disorders and respiratory illnesses like asthma, these standards represent a major victory for clean air and public health," the agency's director says. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - The Environmental Protection Agency unveiled new standards on Wednesday sharply limiting emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants from the nation's coal- and oil-burning power plants.
The new rule, unless blocked by Congress or the courts, will be the first time the federal government has enforced limits on mercury, arsenic, acid gases and other poisonous and carcinogenic chemicals emitted by the burning of fossil fuels.
Lisa P. Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator, said the regulations, which have taken more than 20 years to formulate, would save thousands of lives and return economic and health benefits many times their estimated $9.6 billion annual cost.
"By cutting emissions that are linked to developmental disorders and respiratory illnesses like asthma, these standards represent a major victory for clean air and public health - and especially for the health of our children," Ms. Jackson said in a statement.
President Obama, who in Septemberrejected a proposed E.P.A. rule covering smog-causing emissions as too burdensome to industry, said he fully supported the new rule. He directed the agency to ensure that companies were given sufficient time and flexibility to comply.
He said the new set of regulations, formally known as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, "represents a major step forward in my administration's efforts to protect public health and the environment."
Although the release of the rule had been delayed several times, the final version looked much like the proposed regulations published in March. White House officials consulted extensively with industry representatives about the impact of the new standards but in the end asked the E.P.A. for only minor changes.
Republican officials and a number of plant operators criticized the rule and are likely to challenge it in court and in Congress. They said it was too expensive and would force the premature closing of scores of power plants, eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs and threaten the supply of electricity in some parts of the country.
Scott H. Segal, who represents utilities that would be affected by the rule, said the E.P.A. was playing down the costs and double-counting the benefits. "The bottom line," he said in an analysis of the regulation, is that "this rule is the most expensive air rule that E.P.A. has ever proposed in terms of direct costs."
He added, "It is certainly the most extensive intervention into the power market and job market that E.P.A. has ever attempted to implement."
Environmental advocates challenged Mr. Segal's analysis, and his views are not universally shared in the power industry. Ralph Izzo, the chief executive of the Public Service Enterprise Group, the parent of New Jersey's largest electric utility, said his company had spent $1.3 billion to bring his plants into compliance with New Jersey's air quality rules, which are as stringent as the new federal standards. He said other utilities had had more than enough notice to clean up their facilities in advance of the federal rule announced on Wednesday.
Mr. Izzo said that the E.P.A. action was "long overdue," and that the Clean Air Act, under which the new standards were issued, provided enough flexibility to allow all power generators to come into compliance without a threat to the electric supply.
Mercury is a neurotoxin, harming the nervous systems of fetuses and young children and causing lifelong developmental problems, according to the E.P.A. Other pollutants covered by the new rule, including dioxin, can cause cancer, premature death, heart disease and asthma, the agency said.
Power plants generally have up to four years to comply, although waivers can be granted in individual cases to ensure that the lights stay on. The E.P.A. estimated that utilities would be forced to retire plants that currently provide less than one-half of 1 percent of the nation's generating capacity.
The rule is the first national one to put limits on emissions of mercury and other toxic gases from power plants, although more than a dozen states have imposed such regulations. TheGeorge W. Bush administration proposed a rule covering mercury emissions, but environmental and health groups blocked it in court on the ground that it did not meet the minimum standards of the Clean Air Act.
SenatorJames M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the senior Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee, vowed to block the new regulations.
"Sadly, this rule isn't about public health," he said in a statement. "It is a thinly veiled electricity tax that continues the Obama administration's war on affordable energy and is the latest in an unprecedented barrage of regulations that make up E.P.A.'s job-killing regulatory agenda."
The E.P.A. said that when the rule was fully in effect, it would prevent 90 percent of the mercury in coal burned in power plants from being emitted into the air and reduce acid gas emissions from power plants by 88 percent.
The rule applies to 1,400 power-generation units at 600 coal- or oil-burning plants. About half the coal boilers lack what the E.P.A. calls "advanced pollution control equipment"; some are more than 50 years old.
The E.P.A. estimated that the rules would eliminate "up to 11,000 premature deaths" per year, along with thousands of heart attacks, asthma attacks and emergency room visits.
The impact on the electric system is difficult to quantify, in part because the administration is moving forward on two other major rules affecting power plants, one for plants east of the Rockies that send pollution across state borders, and another governing discharges of warm water. Plant owners may calculate that it is cheaper to build a new plant burning natural gas than to upgrade an old coal-burner.
Susan F. Tierney, a consultant who was an assistant secretary of energy for policy during the Clinton administration and a utility regulator in Massachusetts, said the cross-state rule and the new mercury rule might push out of business plants that were "on the margin" financially.
Plants with stronger economics may upgrade to control mercury and other hazardous pollutants, she said, because the water rule is still several years in the future.
Ms. Tierney said the mercury rule was the biggest E.P.A. rule on power plants since the mid-1990s, although other changes could be coming. "Under existing rules, it's really the next big action-forcing regulation," she said. Eventually, she said, E.P.A. regulation of greenhouse gases could have a broader impact, but that rule is still being written.

HEADLINE: Nobody Could Have Predicted

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Unless they paid attention to history. 

 BODY:
For the most part I've been staying out of the "Why was the stimulus so inadequate?" debate, since it mostly revolves around an unanswerable question: could Obama have gotten more if he had tried and/or made a stronger case? 
One thing I would note, however, is that the defense people outside the administration make for the inadequate stimulus is very different from the defense the administration makes. Outside defenders argue that Obama got all he could; but administration figures like Jay Carney claim that the reason the stimulus wasn't bigger was that nobody realized how deep the recession was going to be.
That is, of course, not true -- I, in particular, was tearing my hair out in public over the inadequacy of the plan:
I see the following scenario: a weak stimulus plan, perhaps even weaker than what we're talking about now, is crafted to win those extra GOP votes. The plan limits the rise in unemployment, but things are still pretty bad, with the rate peaking at something like 9 percent and coming down only slowly. And then Mitch McConnell says "See, government spending doesn't work."
Let's hope I've got this wrong.
But how could we know that the plan was inadequate? History!
People usually cite the Reinhart-Rogoff averages, but for a longer-term project I've been working on I looked at a particular case, Sweden in the early 90s. Sweden was actually a very relevant model, since it had a banking crisis but successfully resolved that crisis, yet suffered an extended period of economic weakness anyway. So here's real GDP for Sweden and the US, with time "t" being the year financial crisis began (1990 for Sweden, 2007 for the US -- yes, you could make a case for 2008 instead, but it wouldn't matter much):
Not a perfect match, but pretty close. And in both cases it wasn't until year 4 that real GDP reached its previous peak.
To this day I really, really don't know why the administration didn't grasp the likelihood that this would be a long haul.

HEADLINE: Republican Unity Cracks as Election Nears

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The split among Senate and House Republicans over the payroll tax cut extension suggests that Republican unity may fray as 2012 approaches. 

 BODY:
The criticism of the House Republicans this week has been fierce.
One senator accused them of "playing politics" and said their actions would "hurt American families and be detrimental to our fragile economy."
Another said there was "no reason" for House Republicans to oppose a two-month extension of the payroll tax cut, and added that "What is playing out in Washington, D.C., this week is about political leverage, not about what's good for the American people."
And a third urged House Republicans to pass the short-term payroll tax cut bill because "this is best for the country, as well as for all the individuals who are affected."
The remarkable thing about all of that criticism is that it did not come from Democrats. Rather, the angry, disbelieving rhetoric came from Senate Republicans, who until now have maintained a nearly airtight alliance with their Republican colleagues in the House.
That Republican unity during the last three years has created enormous political problems for President Obama, who has been repeatedly stymied in his efforts to push forward his agenda. Just about every time Mr. Obama sought to drive a wedge between House and Senate Republicans, he failed.
But the vote to authorize the short-term payroll tax extension - which passed the Senate by a vote of 89 to 10 - suggests that the Republican unity may be cracking in the face of a searing reality for the members: 2012 is an election year.
For the Republican senators who must face the voters next year, especially those in tough races, the idea of allowing payroll taxes to increase on Jan. 1 is not a palatable option. Their willingness to accommodate the ideological imperatives of the House Republicans may be weakening.
Scott P. Brown, the Republican senator from Massachusetts, was the one to accuse his House colleagues of "playing politics." In comments before the House vote on Tuesday to reject the Senate compromise bill, he went even further.
"We are Americans first; now is not the time for drawing lines in the sand," said Mr. Brown, who faces a tough re-election battle against Elizabeth Warren in a state - Massachusetts - that leans Democratic. He called the actions of the House Republicans "irresponsible and wrong."
Dean Heller, a freshman senator from Nevada, was the one who referred to "political leverage." Mr. Heller echoed Democratic lawmakers (and Mr. Obama) who argued that a year-long extension of the tax cut was preferable. But Mr. Heller, who was appointed to fill the term of John Ensign and faces election next year, said he supported a short-term deal in the meantime.
And Richard G. Lugar, a veteran Republican senator from Indiana who also faces re-election this year, was the one who said the two-month dealwas "best for the country."
"I'm hopeful there are a majority of Republicans and Democrats today who will proceed," he said on Monday on MSNBC.
The decision by senators like Mr. Brown, Mr. Heller and Mr. Lugar, to break ranks with House Republican orthodoxy may help them withstand challenges next year. 
But the every-man-for-himself approach threatens to undermine the successful political strategy that Republicans have been employing against Mr. Obama since the day he took office three years ago.
In the early part of Mr. Obama's term, Republicans voted en masse against the stimulus and health care bills, forcing the president to rely solely on Democratic votes and setting up political arguments that helped them retake the House during the 2010 midterm elections.
Since then, the Senate Republicans - under the guidance of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky - have stuck by Speaker John A. Boehner through difficult negotiations over the budget, the debt ceiling, the Bush-era tax cuts and other divisive issues.
Now, Republican senators who voted for the short-term payroll tax cut are saying they recognize that the dispute, and ones like it that could arise next year, are a potential threat.
"It is harming the Republican Party. It is harming the view, if it's possible anymore, of the American people about Congress," Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said on CNN Tuesday. "We've got to get this resolved and with the realization that the payroll tax cut must remain in effect."
In the past three years, Mr. McCain has been a harsh critic of Mr. Obama. His earlier reputation, as a Senate moderate who often challenged the Republican ideology, has been less visible of late as he has repeatedly sided with Mr. Boehner and House Republicans against the president.
But Mr. McCain voted for the two-month extension and urged fellow Republicans in the House to "figure out a way through this" to make sure that taxes do not rise next month.
"I think we have to recognize reality, and that is that we are not going to see the payroll tax cut expire on the first of January, and we have to accommodate to that reality," Mr. McCain said. "It would not be fair to the American people at this time."
Mr. Boehner on Tuesday urged Mr. Obama to direct the Senate to appoint negotiators to work out a deal on the year-long extension of the payroll tax cut before the end of the year. 
In a news conference, Mr. Boehner assailed Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats the way he has done repeatedly throughout the last year.
"All of this needs to be done in the right way," Mr. Boehner said. "I've seen Congress kick the can down the road, kick the can down the road. It's time to stop the nonsense."
But for the first time since he became speaker, Mr. Boehner's criticism is aimed not just at a partisan majority in the Senate, but at his own Republican colleagues.
Will that breakdown of unity continue as Election Day 2012 gets even closer? Or will Republicans in the two chambers find a way to once again stand shoulder-to-shoulder against Mr. Obama's agenda?
The answer could help to determine the fate of Mr. Obama's reelection and the future shape of the Congress.

Today's Times

        
Speaker John A. Boehner and scores of House Republicans turned down a billthat was overwhelmingly supported by both parties in the Senate as well as the White House, Jennifer Steinhauer reports. Mr. Boehner said that his caucus would not relent and accept a two-month extension of the payroll tax cut that was approved by the Senate as a way to buy time for a more permanent solution.

        
Debate over the payroll tax cut has overshadowed the three million people who stand to lose unemployment insurance benefits in the near future, Robert Pear reports. Major provisions of the federal unemployment insurance program begin expiring in the first week of January, with the Labor Department estimating that 2.2 million workers will have lost jobless benefits by mid-February.

        
Rick Santorum received on Tuesday a highly coveted endorsement from Bob Vander Plaats, one of the most visible leaders of the Christian conservative movement. Jeff Zeleny writes that the backing comes at a critical time for Mr. Santorum, but that its impact is uncertain because Mr. Vander Plaats is known as a lightning rod in some Republican circles.

        
Mitt Romney will be on a nine-town bus tour in New Hampshire next week while most of his competitors campaign in Iowa, Ashley Parker and Michael Barbaro report. The move highlights a zealous determination to guard his commanding leadin the polls there, and reveals uncertainty about how he will perform in Iowa.

        
Virginia has the steepest ballot requirements in the country, and Newt Gingrich has not met them, Katharine Q. Seelye reports. His willingness to hold signature-gathering exercises in a state that does not matter right now shows he is serious about staying in the race, but it also shows his chronic lack of field organization.

        
Newt Gingrich is a paradoxical figure for conservatives to embrace - many credit him with advancing their cause, yet many are deeply suspicious of him. Sheryl Gay Stolberg's look at his earliest days in politics help explain why there are questions within the party about whether he is motivated by conservative ideals or personal advancement.

Former Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico is expected to announce his bid for the Libertarian Party nomination at the end of December, Politico reports. He is planning to drop out of the Republican presidential contest soon.

HEADLINE: What Iraqis Think of the American Withdrawal: Babil Province

BYLINE: AN IRAQI JOURNALIST WITH THE YORK TIMES IN BABIL


HIGHLIGHT: In the last installment of our informal survey of Iraqis around the country on the pullout of U.S. forces, we visit Babil Province, home to the ancient Mesopotamian city of Babylon. 

 BODY:
HILLA, Babil Province
Babil, home to the ancient Mesopotamian city of Babylon, is the dividing line between the Sunni and Shiite provinces of Iraq.
The province was crushed along with the rest of the Shiite south after the uprising in 1991, and after the fall of Saddam Hussein, five large mass graves were found here. Dozens of people are missing because of three assassination attempts on Mr. Hussein, which led to the executions of many people in the province.
The entry of Polish and American troops in 2003 initiated a big change in the economic, social, political and religious fabric of the province. Economically, there was a new class of subcontractors. Government employees, lawyers and everyone who spoke English worked with these forces, who had no idea about the nature of Iraqi society. Curiously, most of the people who worked for the overseas forces here were from well-known religious Shiite families that had histories of fighting occupiers and previous governments. They became very rich.
The negative side of the American existence was the destruction of the infrastructure, especially the roads because of the heavy vehicles. American forces gave contracts to incompetent contractors to repair these streets, and the existence of American troops, bases and offices inside the cities led to the closure of many of the streets and continuous bombings. Many families left their homes to go to safer neighborhoods.
The American withdrawal will leave confusion in the economic situation especially after some organizations closed their offices. There is fear of unemployment. The withdrawal of the American troops also makes the people afraid of the Shiite militias, which represent a power above the law in Babil.
Haider Al-Mutairi, 34, Lawyer
1. The U.S. withdrawal will create trouble at the beginning, and I think there will be a transition period from a mess into a better situation. We need to know who will fill the vacuum after the withdrawal. I think we must be concerned about Turkey more than Iran. They will be the next colonialists.
2. I don't think Americans gave anything to Iraq. They achieved what they came for, and I think the biggest winners are the countries that America hates - Iran, Syria, North Korea and China. They achieved huge economic and strategic gains because of America's mistakes.
Dr. Huda Al-Attar, 42, University Professor
1. The U.S. withdrawal will represent a danger in the future because the militias which are active in Iraq will wake up again, and there will be no one to monitor them.
2. I am concerned about the return of violations against women, it was important for America to push the Iraqi government hard on this issue.
3. The Americans supported my organization, which was dedicated to reducing illiteracy.
Ahmed Jalil Al-Ghazi, 37, Journalist
1. We must be thankful to God for getting rid of the U.S. occupier. Although there will remain some representatives and bases, I think we will close them down soon so that Iraq becomes as empty of them as it was before.
2. America achieved its goal of taking its share of our oil.

HEADLINE: The Year in Review - And Next Year in Preview

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: We'll get to hear from actual voters in 2012. What can they say? 

 BODY:
Gail Collins: David, this will be our last conversation of 2011. When we talk next in two weeks, the Iowa caucuses will be over. Who do you think will win? The way things are going, I have to conclude it's going to be Steve Jobs. True, he's no longer alive, but these days everybody seems to like him a lot. Which you certainly cannot say of any of the Republican presidential candidates.
David Brooks: How quickly the year has gone. It seems like just yesterday that the United States economy was still recovering from the financial crisis, the Europeans were desperately trying to preserve the euro, Republicans and Democrats were squabbling about do-or-die budget deals and Mitt Romney was sitting uncomfortably atop the G.O.P. field.
Wait, that was yesterday, and a year ago yesterday.
Personally, I don't think Jobs will win Iowa. Apple, like the Congressional Budget Office, is a quasi-socialist organization. I actually think Romney is going to pull it out. It's been an odd year but I still think the fundamental rules apply. Organization matters. Electability matters. Plausibility matters.
Gail: Last time we talked, you were afraid Newt Gingrich was going to win Iowa. Now it looks as if he's fading under the deluge of attacks from his opponents. Whatever happened to not speaking ill of your fellow Republicans?
David: That was always a myth. Do you remember the fights between the Reaganites and the Republican establishment back in 1976? As vicious as anything today. Gingrich faded because he hadn't raised enough money to keep pace in the advertising wars. Candidates have to do their homework.
Though I have to say a large part of the Republican establishment is buzzing about rumors of a single $25 million PAC donation. People are waiting for that onslaught of Superpac money to sweep through the race, either for Newt or against him.
Gail: Anyway, now it looks as if Ron Paul is moving to the front. This is kind of fascinating. Never did I believe that the Iowa caucuses could go to a guy who doesn't believe in marriage licenses.
David: I thought his dovish Iran policy would kill him, but he at least has the virtue of speaking his mind. If the rest of the candidates are pandering to you, it's nice to have one candidate who will tell you he disagrees with you 100 percent.
Still my guess is that right now Romney has a 90 percent chance of winning the nomination. The other current candidates together have a 5 percent chance and either Mitch Daniels or Jeb Bush has the other five percent. Yes, I do think that if Romney falters or looks weak there is still time and opportunity for the party to drag a respectable candidate out of the wings and settle it at the convention.
Gail: The one single consistent message in all this is the Republicans' desperate desire not to nominate Mitt Romney. Really, you have a half-dozen off-the-wall, totally unsuitable candidates and Mitt. Yet the voters can't bring themselves to pick him. My bet is still that sooner or later the Republican rank-and-file is going to give in, sigh and let Mitt have the nod. But then when we get to next November, the Democratic strategists who are worried about getting turned-off voters to the polls are going to have a whole lot of Republican company. Maybe we'll have an election and nobody will come.
David: Don't forget Americans Elect. I don't know about you, but I take them quite seriously. These are the folks who will have a ballot slot on all 50 states, probably. They're going to have an online convention to pick a candidate. If it's Harvard Law (Obama) against Harvard Business School (Romney), I see room for another ticket.
Gail: Or Ron Paul as an independent. Fun times coming.
You know, last time we talked you suggested - rather wistfully, I thought - that there was a good outside chance that some other respected senior Republican might step into the race. I just heard that Sarah Palin is showing some interest. Was that what you had in mind?
David: O.K., that's not exactly what I had in mind - Michele Bachmann's less-prepared clone. The eclipse of Palin has been one of the nice features of this year. Say what you will about Gingrich, but he doesn't sneer at ideas and the people who love them.
Gail: Can't wait to see what happens next. Meantime, Happy New Year, David.
David: And Happy New Year to you!
And I say that believing that our economic fate (and hence the outcome of the 2012 election) rests in the hands of Angela Merkel and rioters in Rome and Madrid.

HEADLINE: Romney Refuses to Criticize Boehner Over Payroll Tax Vote

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney supports extending a payroll tax holiday, but he wouldn't comment on the Republican divide in the House and Senate over the issue. 

 BODY:
KEENE, N.H. - At a morning campaign stop at a restaurant here, Mitt Romney said that while he supported an extension of the payroll tax cut, he was not willing to get into the "Congressional sausage-making process" and refused to criticize the speaker of the House, John A. Boehner, for siding with Republican members in of the tax break. 
"As you know, I happen to support the idea of extending the payroll tax holiday," Mr. Romney said, when asked about the issue at a news conference. "I don't think this is going to change the economy, but it's certainly going to help a lot of people in tough times. In this Obama economy, this is the last time to raise taxes. We don't want to raise taxes at a time like this."
Mr. Romney declined to say whether he supported Mr. Boehner's decision to reject the proposal, which had the overwhelming support of Senate Republicans. "I just told you my position," he said. "I did not say that, so I'm not going to say that I said that. I'm going to work to find a solution. And how they make that work is something they're going to have to decide amongst themselves."
By rejecting a bill that had already passed the Senate with the support of both parties, as well as the White House, Mr. Boehner created a skirmish within his own party. But rather than address the fight between House and Senate Republicans, Mr. Romney preferred to keep his fire largely trained on President Obama, who he said should have been more involved in the process. 
"My own view is had I been president, I would have been working with the leaders in both parties to see if there's not a way to reach common ground," Mr. Romney said. "My assessment of the circumstances is that there is common ground to reach in this matter. This should have been dealt with some time ago."
Asked what he might have done differently had he been president, Mr. Romney criticized Mr. Obama's leadership skills.
"Well, first I would have met with the leaders. I would have brought them to the White House," Mr. Romney said. "And if they didn't want to come to the White House, I would have gone to their offices. I would have sat down. Leaders are involved it the process, as opposed to standing back and just criticizing the people who are in the process. 
"The Democrats have the majority in the Senate. This is not just a Republican matter, this is Republicans and Democrats. The president should've been working with his leaders in his own party and he should've been reaching across the aisle to find among Republicans those who he thinks could come to common position with the Democrats."

HEADLINE: Finding Success in a Lifelong Passion for Fighting Monopolies

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Through the American Antitrust Institute, Albert A. Foer argues for more enforcement of the antitrust laws, fighting mergers he believes harm competition and countering the evils of cartels. 

 BODY:
Albert A. Foer, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, was enjoying a restful Sunday last March when news broke that AT&T was seeking to buy T-Mobile USA.
Dismayed by the possible blockbuster cellphone merger, Mr. Foer rushed to the institute's global headquarters - the first-floor study of his Washington home - and swung into action.
He complained to a reporter that "AT&T was broken up and now it's back with a vengeance." In the ensuing weeks, his organization would send a letter to the Senate, submit a lengthy objection to the Federal Communications Commission and issue a 38-page white paper arguing that the merger would "result in higher prices, lower quality, less innovation and fewer choices for consumers and businesses."
Faced with fierce opposition from the Obama administration, the two companies scrapped their $39 billion deal on Tuesday, handing Mr. Foer and his fellow antitrust-enforcement advocates a major victory.
"Of course we can't claim credit for putting an end to the merger," said Robert H. Lande, a director at the institute and a law professor at the University of Baltimore. "But we did our part, and this was a wonderful demonstration of how the system sometimes works exactly the way it is supposed to work."
In a city swarming with corporate lobbyists and business interests, the American Antitrust Institute is a rare species. The nonprofit group argues for more vigilant enforcement of the antitrust laws, fighting mergers that it believes harm competition and countering the evils of cartels.
Since its inception in 1998, the organization has largely operated in an environment of lax antitrust regulation. The Bush administration is considered to have had a weak record in policing mergers and bringing monopolization cases. And courts over the last decade have generally cut back on the scope of antitrust liability.
But with the government's opposition to the AT&T-T Mobile deal and investigations like the one into Google's business practices, the Obama administration appears to be reinvigorating antitrust enforcement.
"We've been paying defensive ball the entire time," Mr. Foer said. "It's nice to see a bit of a momentum shift."
Despite its grandiose name, the American Antitrust Institute is nothing more than a virtual network of 120 competition-policy experts around the globe. The organization's tools are somewhat limited. It submits friend-of-the-court filings in legal cases, called amicus briefs; publishes papers and book-length treatises; and hosts symposiums on arcane topics like multichannel distribution in the Internet age.
The institute's secret weapon is Mr. Foer, an indefatigable 67-year-old lawyer with a broad, gap-toothed smile who speaks about tying arrangements and predatory pricing the way most people discuss football and reality TV.
"A lot of Bert's antitrust opinions are annoying," said R. Hewitt Pate, the general counsel of Chevron and a former senior antitrust official in the Bush administration. "You disagree with him on the substance but you enjoy hanging out with him, and there are not enough people in Washington like that."
While well known in antitrust circles, Mr. Foer is not nearly as famous as his children. He and his wife, Esther Safran Foer, are the parents of three accomplished writer sons.
There is Franklin, 37, a former editor of The New Republic who is at work on a book about American liberalism; Jonathan, 32, whose novel, "Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close," is the basis for a Warner Brothers movie set for a Christmas release; and Joshua, 29, a winner of the National Memory Championships and whose book about the science of memory, "Moonwalking With Einstein," was among this year's most acclaimed nonfiction books.
Though a proud father - interviewed last week, he was still beaming from having attended the "Extremely Loud" premiere the night before - Mr. Foer is reticent to discuss his children.
"What I'll say is that you can screw up your kids," he said. "And that's our achievement - we didn't screw them up."
Mr. Foer's interest in antitrust was piqued at the University of Chicago Law School, where he studied under Richard A. Posner and Ronald H. Coase, two leading scholars who promoted a laissez-faire approach to economics that is suspicious of government involvement.
"And I've been criticizing the Chicago School ever since," Mr. Foer said.
After three years at the law firm Hogan & Hartson, Mr. Foer joined the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition. He spent six years there, largely working on policy issues.
In 1983, while back in private practice, Mr. Foer's legal career took a detour. His father had a heart attack, rendering him unable to run the family business, Melart Jewelers. Mr. Foer took over the 15-store Washington-area chain. He ran it for 13 years, and with the company struggling in the mid-'90s, Mr. Foer sold it to a competitor in a fire sale.
"Was I passionate about jewelry?" Mr. Foer said. "No, and that was my failing."
At 50, Mr. Foer had to find a job. After casting about for several years, he returned to antitrust. At the time, although the government was bearing down on Microsoft's monopolistic power, Mr. Foer saw the need for an organization that would pressure the government to toughen its antitrust stance.
A friend introduced him to Ralph Nader, the consumer rights activist, who encouraged Mr. Foer and helped him get his idea off the ground. A major hurdle was raising money, but Mr. Foer soon discovered that certain companies wanted to help him.
"There are always two sides in an antitrust case, and one is normally aligned with consumers," he said. "That side ended up giving us money."
Oracle, which was waging war with Microsoft, wrote the organization one of its first significant checks. A few years later, when the online travel service Orbitz was the subject of an antitrust inquiry, its competitor, Travelocity, gave the institute financial support.
Another source of financing comes from judges distributing unclaimed money from antitrust class-action settlements. The organization has received several million dollars under a legal doctrine called cy pres, which allows courts to dispense leftover cash in class-action lawsuits to benefit public interest programs.
Last month, it received about $900,000 from the settlement fund of an antitrust litigation against the credit card companies.
Today, the American Antitrust Institute runs on a budget of less than $1 million a year. Including Mr. Foer, five people are on the payroll, all of them working out of their homes, from Boston to Boulder. They pay themselves "good civil service salaries," Mr. Foer said.
Even with the government's recent stepped-up efforts in antitrust, Mr. Foer and his colleagues haven't let up. This week, Diana Moss, the group's senior research fellow, wrote an opinion article arguing that a proposal by Delta and US Airways to swap landing slots at New York and Washington airports put consumers at risk for higher fares. Last month, it urged the F.T.C. to block the merger between Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions.
"At its root, antitrust is about human dignity and making sure consumers have a range of choices," Mr. Foer said.
His son Frank said that he had realized ever since he was a child that antitrust was the defining passion of his father's life. That notion came to the fore this year when he visited his father in a hospital recovery room after an operation. He was just waking up from anesthesia.
"We got the bastards," Mr. Foer said groggily.
His family looked at one another, perplexed, and asked what he was talking about.
"I was just in the middle of an antitrust proceeding and we got the bastards," he said.
The moment, said Frank, perfectly expressed his father's id.
"The guy's just coming out of surgery, and he's not thinking about his wife and children," Frank said. "He's thinking about antitrust."

HEADLINE: Foes of Hungary's Government Fear 'Demolition of Democracy'

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

 BODY:
BUDAPEST -- In less than two years as a member of the Hungarian Parliament, Timea Szabo says she has looked on helplessly as the ruling Fidesz Party has used its two-thirds majority to tighten its grip on the news media and the courts, redraw parliamentary districts in its favor and pack the constitutional court with supporters. On Jan. 1, a new ''majoritarian'' Constitution written and ratified by Fidesz takes hold.
''They are preparing the funeral for the Hungarian Republic,'' Ms. Szabo said. Opposition groups, including Ms. Szabo's small, green Politics Can Be Different Party, known by its Hungarian abbreviation L.M.P., have called for a demonstration on Friday against the ''demolition of democracy'' by Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Democracy here is dying not with a single giant blow but with many small cuts, critics say, through the legal processes of Parliament that add up to a slow-motion coup. And in its drift toward authoritarian government, aided by popular disaffection with political gridlock and a public focused mainly on economic hardship, Hungary stands as a potentially troubling bellwether for other, struggling Eastern European countries with weak traditions of democratic government. 
To mounting criticism from the European Union and the United States, Fidesz is racing to use its supermajority in Parliament to pass a flurry of legislation before the new Constitution takes effect, a push that critics say will consolidate overwhelming power with Mr. Orban, a political veteran who got his start opposing Communist rule as it waned in the late 1980s.
Party loyalists are being given 9- to 12-year terms at the head of powerful institutions like the public prosecutor's office and the state audit office. Judges are being forced from the bench with a drop in the mandatory retirement age to 62 from 70, even while the approval process is being altered to assure the speedy ascension of the government's nominees. On Tuesday, Hungary's media council announced that it intended to throw an independent, opposition-aligned radio station, Klubradio, off the air.
''What you have is the systematic destruction of checks and balances in the government,'' said Peter Hack, a law professor at the Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest who, as a member of Parliament from the pro-business Free Democrats, worked on judicial matters. ''The present situation is really a building where the foundations are weakened.''
Mr. Orban and his supporters counter that they are only following through on their promises in last year's election campaign to sweep away the old order, which they say was hamstrung by compromises to ensure a smooth transition from communism but left behind a legacy of gridlock. Government supporters note the left-wing opposition's contradictory claims, on the one hand saying that Fidesz is establishing unassailable authoritarian control while warning that the real danger is the far-right party Jobbik taking control of a system of government shorn of checks and balances.
The constitutional court this week struck down portions of the controversial media law, as well as changes to the criminal code and a law governing churches, but the high court's own purview will be limited by the new Constitution, one of several steps reining in the power and independence of the judiciary.
Meanwhile, representatives of the International Monetary Fund and European Commission walked out of negotiations last week over assistance for the heavily indebted country after the government introduced proposals to significantly restrict the independence of the Hungarian National Bank.
As the pace of legislative and constitutional change gained speed this year, international observers including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressed concerns over the erosion of independent institutions. But the situation in Hungary has remained largely under the radar in Europe, whose leaders have been almost entirely preoccupied with the sovereign debt crisis that has threatened the survival of the euro.
On a recent afternoon at the ornate Parliament building here on the Danube River, Ms. Szabo strode out of a meeting of her party. ''We are discussing the latest crisis of the democracy,'' Ms. Szabo said. ''It is a nightmare.''
With Mr. Orban's center-right Fidesz Party proposing and passing legislation more or less at will, Ms. Szabo and other opposition lawmakers sometimes had only a few hours' warning before debates began on complex laws. Her party decided to boycott Tuesday's debate on the central bank legislation.
''We more and more feel that by sitting there in Parliament we're legitimizing what's happening without really being able to do anything about it,'' Ms. Szabo said.
The new Constitution, she noted, fittingly changed the name of the country, removing the word Republic and leaving it officially just Hungary.
Zoltan Kovacs, a government spokesman, said that opposition parties and the analysts sympathetic to them were painting legal changes in a dire light simply because they disagreed politically. ''Whatever we do, the first accusation is that we are reducing the independence, the autonomy of that working body,'' Mr. Kovacs said.
''It's a little bit curious for an external observer because it seems to be fast, it seems to be too much at once, but that's actually what we have promised,'' Mr. Kovacs said. ''We are refurbishing; we are renewing the country.''
The level of antagonism in Hungarian politics rose significantly starting in September 2006, when radio stations played a leaked recording of Ferenc Gyurcsany, the Socialist prime minister, who admitted that he had lied to the public about the dire state of the country's economy before elections.
Before austerity became the watchword for countries like Greece, Ireland and Spain, the Hungarian government was cutting government jobs, raising taxes and imposing new fees to try to control its growing budget deficits as early as 2007. Steel barriers surrounded the Parliament building to protect it from tens of thousands of demonstrators.
Dissatisfaction over cutbacks and Mr. Gyurcsany's speech helped fuel the rise of the nationalist, anti-Semitic Jobbik Party. Once a fringe group with a paramilitary wing, an energized Jobbik won nearly 17 percent of the vote in 2010.
But the main beneficiary of voter outrage toward the Socialists was Fidesz, which gained a critical two-thirds majority in Parliament -- enough to pass constitutional amendments and even an entire new Constitution without votes from opposition parties.
Zoltan Horvath, 51, an engineer from Szombathely in western Hungary, said that a ''tabula rasa'' was necessary after the compromises of the post-Communist transition. ''Yes, there is a risk that one party has too much power, but the desire to change things is correct. There is danger, but I don't have sleepless nights,'' Mr. Horvath said.
But Fidesz's popularity is sinking fast in opinion surveys. Mr. Hack, the law professor, said he was concerned that Jobbik would benefit from the rising antiestablishment mood and anger over deeper cuts in public spending. ''A lot of people are not saying that Orban is doing too much, but that he is doing too little,'' Mr. Hack said.
The centralization of power would look very different, even to Fidesz, with someone else in charge. ''In the short term it seems reasonable to take out the brakes from a car, it appears to go faster,'' Mr. Hack said. ''The problem is when the first curve appears and you need them.''

HEADLINE: Tough Choices for Cities as Federal Aid Shrinks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
ALLENTOWN, Pa. -- It is no secret that these are hard times for cities, with tax collections down, state aid dwindling, unemployment high and foreclosures pitting many blocks. So, as he sat in his office here, Mayor Ed Pawlowski of Allentown echoed the question mayors around the country are asking: Why has Washington cut one of the main federal programs for cities by a quarter in the last couple of years?
''It's just insane,'' an exasperated-sounding Mayor Pawlowski said.
The shrinking federal program, called Community Development Block Grants, was devised by the Nixon administration to bypass state governments and send money directly to big cities, which were given broad leeway to decide how to spend it. This year the federal government is giving out just $2.9 billion -- a billion dollars less than it gave two years ago, and even less than it gave during the Carter administration, when the money went much further. 
Here in Allentown the steadily shrinking funds mean that there will be hard choices ahead.
The grants have helped pay for the tidy new facades on restaurants like Casa Latina and Winston's West Indian & American Restaurant on Seventh Street, which have been credited with sprucing up the neighborhood and drawing college students downtown to eat. They have paid for inspections of 1,500 homes in the city's poorest wards, and for repairs of some. And recently, behind a door with an orange ''Unfit for Human Habitation'' sticker on it, they paid a crew to do a gut rehab of a blighted row house at the edge of a blossoming historic district.
The money is not just for brick-and-mortar projects. It pays for two after-school teachers at St. Luke's Neighborhood Center, where a couple of dozen children, some homeless, spent a recent afternoon making artwork by gluing pompoms to strips of foam. And it helps pay for the Daybreak program, a drop-in center for people with mental illness or substance abuse problems, where a couple of dozen people spent the afternoon watching ''Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol'' on a big-screen television while workers scurried around the kitchen, which serves three meals a day. But with its share of the grant halved in recent years, to $15,000, Daybreak is looking for savings.
''We do stand the chance of having to cut a staff member,'' said the Rev. Dr. Christine L. Nelson, the executive director of the Lehigh County Conference of Churches, which runs Daybreak, who said other sources of money were drying up as well. ''That would be very difficult because with this kind of program, we only have five as it is, and we need to keep two on the floor at all times for safety's sake, for the clients' safety.''
Cuts to the block grants program were cited in a recent report by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, which noted that the number of vacant properties in America has jumped to 10 million from 7 million in 2000, threatening to attract crime and cause blight. ''With sustained high foreclosure and unemployment rates and further declining home values, local officials said that continued, flexible C.D.B.G. funding would help them maintain efforts to address vacant properties in their areas,'' the report noted.
The program has its share of critics. The flexibility that so endears it to mayors and county executives has sometimes led to terrible misuses of the money, and even to criminal fraud. Policing the program has become a cottage industry for federal investigators, who have found money squandered over the years on foolish projects and on things like company picnics, gifts and bonuses, and who have won quite a few indictments related to the grants. And the complicated formulas used to divide the money among about 1,200 local governments -- based on population, poverty, the age of housing stock and overcrowding -- have been criticized as not sending the money to the neediest communities.
But mayors see it as an invaluable tool -- one of the few federal programs that sends money directly to big cities, without going through the middlemen at the state level. Before its creation, mayors had to apply for small grants in many specific areas -- leading to complaints of the this-food-is-terrible-and-the-portions-are-so-small variety. Tom Cochran, the executive director of the United States Conference of Mayors, said that mayors were thrilled when the Nixon administration agreed to consolidate the various grants into a single block grant program, which could be used broadly for community development, with local officials choosing their priorities. It was signed into law by President Gerald R. Ford.
''It's been the mainstay of support for urban America across the board,'' Mr. Cochran said.
The money each city gets may seem small -- Allentown got $2.5 million this year, a small sliver of its $89 million budget -- but mayors say that the money, and the freedom to decide how to spend it, makes a big difference.
So mayors were furious when Congress cut the grants program last month to $2.9 billion, a cut of 25 percent over two years. President Obama had sought to reduce the program, too, but by less: his budget proposal had called for a 7.5 percent cut. ''This is a tough choice that balances the need to decrease the budget deficit with the tough fiscal conditions confronting state and local governments,'' the proposal said.
Allentown, which used to spend about $2 million a year rehabilitating properties, now spends $1.2 million. It used to employ 16 local contractors and their workers, but now has work for only 10. Local officials worry that they will have to cut back even more.
The historic Old Allentown area, a stretch of neat brick row houses with brightly painted wooden shutters and the occasional rainbow flag flying, is far removed from the Rust Belt image of the city that Billy Joel captured in his song ''Allentown.''
As he drove through the neighborhood and its surrounding streets, pointing out blighted houses that had been restored and carved-up rental apartments that had been made into single-family homes again, David Paulus, the director of the city's building standards and safety bureau, said the grant program had helped spur private investment.
''There's been a lot of development since we seeded the area,'' he said.
The city still has a hard-edged feel in many parts. Blue strobe lights flash at some intersections to warn residents that police surveillance cameras are watching, and an Occupy Allentown movement pitched tents this fall by the Soldiers and Sailors Monument downtown, not far from the church that briefly hid Philadelphia's Liberty Bell from the British during the Revolutionary War. Now officials in Allentown -- Pennsylvania's third-largest and fastest-growing city -- worry that the cuts to the grant money will slow the progress they have made bringing people back downtown.
''It has really helped us limit blight, and rebuilt some of our poorest neighborhoods,'' Mayor Pawlowski said. ''With the continual reduction of this funding, we're able to do less and less.''

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Sets Poison Standards for Power Plants

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - The Environmental Protection Agency unveiled new standards on Wednesday sharply limiting emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants from the nation's coal- and oil-burning power plants.
The new rule, unless blocked by Congress or the courts, will be the first time the federal government has enforced limits on mercury, arsenic, acid gases and other poisonous and carcinogenic chemicals emitted by the burning of fossil fuels.
Lisa P. Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator, said the regulations, which have taken more than 20 years to formulate, would save thousands of lives and return economic and health benefits many times their estimated $9.6 billion annual cost.
''By cutting emissions that are linked to developmental disorders and respiratory illnesses like asthma, these standards represent a major victory for clean air and public health - and especially for the health of our children,'' Ms. Jackson said in statement. 
President Obama, who in September rejected a proposed E.P.A. rule covering smog-causing emissions as too burdensome to industry, said he fully supported the new rule. He directed the agency to ensure that companies were given sufficient time and flexibility to comply.
He said the new set of regulations, formally known as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, ''represents a major step forward in my administration's efforts to protect public health and the environment.''
Although the release of the rule had been delayed several times, the final version looked much like the proposed regulations published in March. White House officials consulted extensively with industry representatives about the impact of the new standards but in the end asked the E.P.A. for only minor changes.
Republican officials and a number of plant operators criticized the rule and are likely to challenge it in court and in Congress. They said it was too expensive and would force the premature closing of scores of power plants, eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs and threaten the supply of electricity in some parts of the country.
Scott H. Segal, who represents utilities that would be affected by the rule, said the E.P.A. was playing down the costs and double-counting the benefits. ''The bottom line,'' he said in an analysis of the regulation, is that ''this rule is the most expensive air rule that E.P.A. has ever proposed in terms of direct costs.''
He added, ''It is certainly the most extensive intervention into the power market and job market that E.P.A. has ever attempted to implement.''
Environmental advocates challenged Mr. Segal's analysis, and his views are not universally shared in the power industry. Ralph Izzo, the chief executive of the Public Service Enterprise Group, the parent of New Jersey's largest electric utility, said his company had spent $1.3 billion to bring his plants into compliance with New Jersey's air quality rules, which are as stringent as the new federal standards. He said other utilities had had more than enough notice to clean up their facilities in advance of the federal rule announced on Wednesday.
Mr. Izzo said that the E.P.A. action was ''long overdue,'' and that the Clean Air Act, under which the new standards were issued, provided enough flexibility to allow all power generators to come into compliance without a threat to the electric supply.
Mercury is a neurotoxin, harming the nervous systems of fetuses and young children and causing lifelong developmental problems, according to the E.P.A. Other pollutants covered by the new rule, including dioxin, can cause cancer, premature death, heart disease and asthma, the agency said.
Power plants generally have up to four years to comply, although waivers can be granted in individual cases to ensure that the lights stay on. The E.P.A. estimated that utilities would be forced to retire plants that currently provide less than one-half of 1 percent of the nation's generating capacity.
The rule is the first national one to put limits on emissions of mercury and other toxic gases from power plants, although more than a dozen states have imposed such regulations. TheGeorge W. Bush administration proposed a rule covering mercury emissions, but environmental and health groups blocked it in court on the ground that it did not meet the minimum standards of the Clean Air Act.
SenatorJames M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the senior Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee, vowed to block the new regulations.
''Sadly, this rule isn't about public health,'' he said in a statement. ''It is a thinly veiled electricity tax that continues the Obama administration's war on affordable energy and is the latest in an unprecedented barrage of regulations that make up E.P.A.'s job-killing regulatory agenda.''
The E.P.A. said that when the rule was fully in effect, it would prevent 90 percent of the mercury in coal burned in power plants from being emitted into the air and reduce acid gas emissions from power plants by 88 percent.
The rule applies to 1,400 power-generation units at 600 coal- or oil-burning plants. About half the coal boilers lack what the E.P.A. calls ''advanced pollution control equipment''; some are more than 50 years old.
The E.P.A. estimated that the rules would eliminate ''up to 11,000 premature deaths'' per year, along with thousands of heart attacks, asthma attacks and emergency room visits.
The impact on the electric system is difficult to quantify, in part because the administration is moving forward on two other major rules affecting power plants, one for plants east of the Rockies that send pollution across state borders, and another governing discharges of warm water. Plant owners may calculate that it is cheaper to build a new plant burning natural gas than to upgrade an old coal-burner.
Susan F. Tierney, a consultant who was an assistant secretary of energy for policy during the Clinton administration and a utility regulator in Massachusetts, said the cross-state rule and the new mercury rule might push out of business plants that were ''on the margin'' financially.
Plants with stronger economics may upgrade to control mercury and other hazardous pollutants, she said, because the water rule is still several years in the future.
Ms. Tierney said the mercury rule was the biggest E.P.A. rule on power plants since the mid-1990s, although other changes could be coming. ''Under existing rules, it's really the next big action-forcing regulation,'' she said. Eventually, she said, E.P.A. regulation of greenhouse gases could have a broader impact, but that rule is still being written.
Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Reducing Inequality in Our Schools

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Helen F. Ladd and Edward B. Fiske are right to remind us of the disadvantages faced by poor children in our high-stakes educational system (''Class Matters. Why Won't We Admit It?,'' Op-Ed, Dec. 12).
Our current policies are like a requirement that all children clear the same height in the high jump, regardless of their stature. To make matters worse, tall kids get excellent coaching, first-class facilities and regular practice, while short kids get a pine branch suspended over two old sawhorses. 
But local programs like those cited by the writers, the East Durham Children's Initiative in North Carolina or Say Yes to Education in Syracuse, N.Y., are much too limited to have any real impact. We need statewide or nationwide efforts to make a real difference.
One promising idea is universal prekindergarten, which is already in place in Oklahoma and Georgia. These states, hardly bastions of liberalism, have found the programs to be politically popular because they offer benefits to all children. But because the programs have greater effects for the poor than for the middle or upper class, they nevertheless help to close the achievement gap.
PAUL GARY WYCKOFF Clinton, N.Y., Dec. 13, 2011
The writer is a professor of government and director of the Public Policy Program at Hamilton College.
To the Editor:
A study of the Baltimore schools years ago revealed that poor kids start kindergarten behind middle-class kids and fall further behind every summer away from school, while both groups learn at the same rate while in school. Yet we have wrongheadedly blamed the schools and not poverty for this gap.
The solution is also plain -- more support services, preschool, all-day kindergarten, and longer school days and years, to give poor kids a chance to catch up. This formula works for every charter school that succeeds, yet we refuse to apply it to all public schools.
Why does our nation shamefully refuse to focus on this truth? It costs money.
JAMES P. LENFESTEY Minneapolis, Dec. 12, 2011
The writer is a retired journalist who covered education.
To the Editor:
The real way to reduce the achievement gap between rich and poor schools is to reduce the inequality itself by subsidizing poor school districts with more federal money. ''Throwing money at the problem'' has become a political bugaboo, particularly during these cash-strapped times. But it is long past time we stopped going out of our way to treat only the symptoms of school poverty.
The achievement gap is an explicitly economic malady. It requires an economic cure.
MIKE LEONARD Chicago, Dec. 12, 2011
To the Editor:
As a public school teacher, I was pleased to see an Op-Ed essay addressing the major role that poverty plays in educational achievement. But what needs to change is not the schools -- since American schools with poverty rates below 10 percent have truly excellent test scores -- but the poverty.
It was disappointing, then, to find Helen F. Ladd and Edward B. Fiske suggesting that school systems become providers of social services. That is not a school's job. It is the society that needs to change, not the schools.
ERIC COLBURN Cambridge, Mass., Dec. 12, 2011
To the Editor:
While there may be socioeconomic reasons students living in poverty do poorly in school, the key reason is a shortage of qualified teachers. Teachers in these challenging schools often lack the experience, qualifications or even the desire to be there. They stay only to gain experience or until vacancies surface in more desirable schools.
Research shows that an effective teacher can make a difference. Let's get the best teachers working and staying in these schools and reward them for doing so. A child's ZIP code should not determine his or her educational fate.
PHILIP S. CICERO North Massapequa, N.Y., Dec. 12, 2011
The writer is a retired school superintendent.

Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the concern of some economists that a failure to extend the payroll tax cut could undercut the country's fragile economic recovery described incorrectly the increase in taxes that would occur without such Congressional action. Taxes on the payroll income of America's 160 million wage earners would increase to 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent; the change would not amount to a 2 percent tax increase.

HEADLINE: With a New Year, A New Location

BYLINE: By ROB COX

 BODY:
When this column first appeared on Sept. 23, 2008, the financial world was in a state of panic. Global markets were reeling from the collapse of Lehman Brothers eight days before. The Bush administration had changed its no-bailouts policy when the giant insurer American International Group wobbled. The debut Breakingviews column noted that General Electric's finance arm ''holds the rest of the group's top-notch businesses hostage'' and that G.E.'s board would have been ''irresponsible'' not to ask, ''What if GE Capital ran into a financing crunch?''
As it turned out, things would get far worse before stabilizing. G.E. shares plunged from around $26 to $7 at their nadir a few months later. Washington lawmakers, and governments around the world, injected trillions of taxpayer dollars into shoring up their banks and financial markets -- much of it still at risk. The crisis has moved on during the last three years or more, but huge economic imbalances persist. Many of the private sector's woes in the developed world were absorbed by governments, which are now struggling to handle ballooning debts. 
It has been an exciting period in financial journalism. But as times have changed, so must we. After the end of the year, Breakingviews will no longer appear in the print edition of The New York Times. Articles will, however, appear regularly in the DealBook section of NYTimes.com and daily in the pages of The International Herald Tribune. With space in print an increasingly precious commodity, the paper has invested in beefing up its business coverage. Breakingviews, too, is in a different situation. Two years ago it became the global financial commentary arm of Thomson Reuters.
In the final weeks before our partnership with The Times changes, Breakingviews will publish a series of views that we hope will offer some insight into where markets, the economy and a handful of important companies are heading in the coming year. Next year, these articles will be collected in a book that will be available for download at the Breakingviews.com and Reuters.com. A few of the topics to come are these:
Investment banking dreams may die. Many firms cut jobs and slashed pay in 2011. But they'll have to do more in the coming year to have any hope of increasing returns. Smaller players, like Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale and Nomura, may even conclude they're better off quitting the investment banking game.
More corporate carve-ups will delight mergers and acquisitions bankers. This was the year of the spinoff. Fiat, ConocoPhillips and ITT helped deal volume rise nearly sixfold to $230 billion. Rocky economic times probably won't give chief executives much reason to shop, so expect more. Even holdouts like G.E., Goldman Sachs and PepsiCo may consider splits.
For the president's 2012 hopes, it really is the economy. An analysis paired with an interactive calculator will show how economic growth in the coming 11 months -- more than, say, the unemployment rate -- is the key to Barack Obama's re-election hopes.
New currency unions could yet see the light of day. The euro is in trouble, but if leaders successfully realign political and fiscal policies with monetary facts on the ground, it could set a precedent. Single currencies have big advantages. The Persian Gulf states and South America might one day embrace the idea.
Itau of Brazil is the bank to watch next year. It bills itself as ''the Global Latin American Bank.'' But it's not -- at least not yet. Solid finances, determined management, a robust market value and a wealth of opportunities from the misfortunes of others could make Itau's bold ambitions come true.
Chinese economic growth may dip below 8 percent. Most China watchers are still predicting close to 9 percent growth. Three things could push the country's G.D.P. growth to a 10-year low: falling house prices, a slump in property investment and slowing exports. Beijing stimulated the economy last time, but it can ill afford a second round.
Corporate bonds will take on sovereignlike status. The woeful state of national balance sheets will push risk-averse investors into the debt of highly rated companies like Microsoft. Corporate bonds could prove more attractive than even top-quality sovereigns.

HEADLINE: Why Some Business Owners Think Now Is the Time to Sell

BYLINE: By KATHERINE REYNOLDS LEWIS

 BODY:
Looking back, Cyndi Finkle wishes she had sold her craft services company, Sunday Night Dinner, early in 2008 when the economy was booming. With a track record of 30 to 50 percent annual growth for each of the previous five years, it could have been a compelling transaction.
At the time, however, she was not emotionally ready to part with a business she had started in 1997 and built into one of the largest suppliers of services to television crews and casts in Los Angeles. When her husband suggested selling, ''I burst into tears and looked at him as if he were telling me to cut off my arm,'' Ms. Finkle said. ''Then everything changed, and I realized he was right.''
But the recession hit, and Ms. Finkle's annual revenue dropped sharply along with declining television advertising and production budgets -- making it impossible for her to sell. ''I've had to work really hard the last three years to save my company and get it back, a lot of times working for free,'' she said. ''It was no longer about building it, it was about keeping it going until things got better.'' 
Revenue for 2011 is finally back to 2008 levels, about $1.2 million, and Ms. Finkle is eager to sell. For one thing, she purchased another business, an art studio aimed at children, backed in part by a loan from the Small Business Administration. Moreover, the coming expiration of the Bush tax cuts means that by the end of 2012, the long-term capital gains tax rate will increase to 20 percent from the current 15 percent (unless Congress passes legislation extending the lower rate).
Failing to sell before the end of 2012, she said, could cost her tens of thousands of dollars, ''and knowing that motivates me to sell in 2012.''
Ms. Finkle is not the only small-business owner looking to the new year as an opportune time to sell. There is a pent-up pipeline of owners who have had to put off selling in recent years because of the economy. And now that many of these companies have at least one year of profits on the books, they are more attractive to potential investors.
''A lot of these companies are having record profits because they reduced their overhead in the downturn and now sales are coming back,'' said John D. Emory Jr., chief executive of Emory & Company, a Milwaukee-based investment banking company that specializes in selling businesses with $10 million to $100 million in annual revenue. ''A lot of owners have told me they want to start a sale process in the first half of 2012, hoping to complete the sale before the end of 2012. Many owners, especially the leading edge of the baby boomers, wanted to sell in 2008, 2009 or 2010 and would have sold in those three years had the economy stayed strong.''
Those looking to sell are taking steps to appeal to buyers: trimming costs, diversifying revenue, upgrading financial statements and making the chief executive's role less essential. And they are braced for the sales process to take longer than they would like.
For most owners, the business represents their largest asset, and taxes constitute their largest single expense, said Mackey McNeill, a certified public accountant in Covington, Ky. ''The ability to negotiate the best possible selling price and to minimize taxes determines the owner's financial fate,'' Ms. McNeill said.
To illustrate the impact of the expiring capital gains tax cut, Ms. McNeill created hypothetical companies that would sell for $5 million and $10 million each, assuming typical values for equipment, depreciation, real estate, inventory and good will. According to her calculations, and assuming Congress does not act, the owner would save $150,000 in taxes by selling a $5 million company in 2012 instead of 2013. For a $10 million business, the savings would be $325,000. These assumptions cover both S corporations and limited liability corporations, Ms. McNeill said. They would not be valid for a company operating as a C corporation.
The tax savings are an important factor in Joel Lederhause's quest to sell a majority stake in DiscountRamps.com, a retailer of loading, hauling and transport equipment based in West Bend, Wis. ''We won't continue to grow 15 to 20 percent a year unless we have some outside capital influx,'' Mr. Lederhause said. ''We want some money to go into the company to accelerate its growth, and take a portion of our sweat equity off the table.''
The company, which projects $22 million in sales this year, keeps about $6 million in finished goods in its warehouse, which limits its growth potential. DiscountRamps.com offers 11,000 different products, and keeps at least one of each item in stock. With an infusion of capital, Mr. Lederhause said, the business could grow to more than $100 million in five years by expanding its product lines into promising new markets.
To make the company more attractive to investors, he has focused on cutting costs and maximizing profitability. As a result, gross sales have grown only 6 to 8 percent in recent years, but profits have quadrupled. ''The economy hasn't slowed our growth,'' he said, ''and that's one thing that we can point to when we go out to potential investors.''
Steps taken include replacing outside contractors with well-trained staff; reducing credit card, shipping and interest costs; renegotiating payment terms with vendors; and replacing software systems with free open-source alternatives. He also made sure to understand the company's financial statements backward and forward and to put the growth plan in his head onto paper. Documenting a vision for the company, he said, ''is a lot harder than you think.''
To prepare for the sale of PartyPail, an Internet retailer, Edward Hechter and his wife, Lisa Jacobson, co-owners, have diversified the company's revenue streams, added detail and structure to the books and cross-trained senior staff -- all steps aimed at making the owners less integral to the business. ''As a business owner, you should always be prepared to sell,'' Mr. Hechter said, not only to take advantage of an opportunity but to protect your family and staff in case you are incapacitated. Despite the recession, the company's revenue grew to $3.1 million in 2010, from $2.35 million in 2009 and $850,000 in 2008. Revenue of more than $4.4 million is projected for 2011.
Mr. Hechter says he believes that a clear investor presentation is critical to any acquisition. Members of his management team restructured the income statement to break out the profit or loss from each of the six e-commerce sites that PartyPail operates. They also refined the cash flow model to better project capital requirements and revenue. Finally, they started accruing annual expenses throughout the year and setting aside cash in anticipation of those costs to smooth out the financials and not have ''bad'' months when lump sums were deducted.
As part of a business survival plan, he has started inviting the marketing director and general manager into vendor and supply chain partner meetings, so they are more intimately familiar with how the business works. As a test of how well the company can operate without him and his wife in the office, they took six weeks away last summer, primarily on family vacations. The test went off without a hitch.
''I have a quote on my wall from my Grandma Tillie: 'Success is when opportunity and preparation intersect,' '' Mr. Hechter said, referring to the possibility of selling his company. ''There's no telling what will happen,'' he said, adding, ''Business owners don't have the luxury of saying, 'I'm going to change jobs.' ''

HEADLINE: Signs Point to Economy's Rise, But Experts See a False Dawn

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As the fourth quarter draws to a close, a spate of unexpectedly good economic data suggests that it will have some of the fastest and strongest economic growth since the recovery started in 2009, causing a surge in the stock market and cheering economists, investors and policy makers.
In recent weeks, a broad range of data -- like reports on new residential construction and small business confidence -- have beaten analysts' expectations. Initial claims for jobless benefits, often an early indicator of where the labor market is headed, have dropped to their lowest level since May 2008. And prominent economics groups say the economy is growing three to four times as quickly as it was early in the year, at an annual pace of about 3.7 percent. 
But the good news also comes with a significant caveat. Many forecasters say the recent uptick probably does not represent the long-awaited start to a strong, sustainable recovery. Much of the current strength is caused by temporary factors. And economists expect growth to slow in the first half of 2012 to an annual pace of about 1.5 to 2 percent.
Even that estimate could be optimistic if Washington lawmakers fail to extend aid for the long-term unemployed and a payroll tax cut for the United States' 160 million wage earners.
At stake is about $150 billion, the bulk of which would go to middle-class families and the unemployed. If Congress does not pass the measures, economists say, it would significantly weaken growth from already-damped levels anticipated early in the new year.
''Unfortunately, I think we're going to see a slowdown over the course of next year,'' Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told reporters last week. ''Not only do we have the European crisis spilling over and hurting U.S. trade and confidence,'' he said, but the United States economy also faces ''homegrown shocks.''
There are two reasons for the renewed pessimism. First, economists say that temporary trends increased growth in the fourth quarter and may not continue into next year. Second, the economy faces significant headwinds in 2012: some from Europe's long-lingering sovereign debt crisis, and some from domestic cutbacks beyond the control of President Obama, whose campaign would like to point to a brightening economic picture, not a darkening one. Even the Federal Reserve is predicting that the unemployment rate will remain around 8.6 percent by the time voters go to the polls in November.
The fourth quarter benefited, for instance, from wholesalers restocking inventories of goods like petroleum, paper and cars, giving a jolt to growth.
''We had lean inventories, so those required additional production to satisfy demand,'' said Gregory Daco of IHS Global Insight. ''But once inventories are restocked, there is no need to restock them anymore. That means there's going to be less production,'' he said.
Consumers also pulled back on their savings, helping to finance a recent spurt in spending. a trend that forecasters doubt will continue. Other short-lived factors include falling gasoline and commodity prices, and an increase in orders from Japanese companies returning to business after the devastating spring tsunami.
But next year, Washington is increasing some taxes and reducing spending as temporary measures enacted during the worst of the recession expire. That will damp growth by a percentage point or more next year, forecasters say. Provisions like a tax write-off to help businesses pay for equipment are winding down or ending.
Most worrying is the prospect that Congress will drop aid for the long-term jobless and allow payroll taxes to rise to 6.2 percent from the current level of 4.2 percent, amounting to a $1,000 tax increase on the average wage earner. Macroeconomic Advisers, a prominent forecaster, estimates that the expiration of the two provisions could cost the economy 400,000 jobs and cut growth by half a percentage point next year.
How and when Congress acts will also have an important, if impossible to quantify, impact on consumer and business confidence, economists say. Households and companies uncertain about their income, unclear about their tax rates and lacking confidence in their government might hold off on major financial purchases and tighten their purse strings.
Then there is Europe.
''If there is some Lehman-type event in the first half of the year, it will have a big impact,'' said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers. The collapse of Lehman Brothers, a New York investment bank, in late 2008 helped set off the financial crisis.
Even without such a major event, forecasters say problems on the Continent will weigh on American growth next year. Investor flight from assets denominated in the shaky euro have made the dollar stronger and American exports less competitive abroad. The euro zone's woes have also made a global slowdown more likely, which could mean a reduction in American exports to emerging-market countries as well.
For now, Democrats and Republicans remain at loggerheads, blaming each other for the uncertainty around the payroll tax rates and aid for the unemployed.
''A two-month extension creates uncertainty and will cause problems for people who are trying to create jobs,'' John Boehner, Republican of Ohio and speaker of the House, said on Monday.
''The clock is ticking. Time is running out,'' President Obama said at a White House news briefing on Tuesday. ''One of the House Republicans referred to what they're doing as 'high-stakes poker.' He's right about the stakes, but this is not poker. This is not a game.''

HEADLINE: Officials Seize Counterfeit Holiday Goods and Make Numerous Arrests

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
While counterfeiters are well known for cashing in during the holidays on high-price items like fake Chanel bags, this year they have put more energy into the lower end -- expanding into Christmas lights, plastic Angry Birds toys and National Football League jerseys.
It is a bleak economy, even when it is a counterfeit economy. 
''They're keeping up with the times,'' said John Morton, the director of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which plans to announce Thursday that recently it has seized about 327,000 counterfeit items worth about $77 million in the United States, along with some merchandise from Mexico.
Thirty-three people were arrested -- 30 arrests in the United States and three in South Korea -- and charged with counterfeit-goods trafficking, the authorities said.
''People tend to focus on luxury goods and DVDs, and that really understates the problem,'' Mr. Morton said. ''We live in an age where literally everything, from medicine to air bags to circuit boards, are being counterfeited.''
The fake products are keeping up with demand: Angry Birds toys, for instance, became available only this year and are already being copied widely. Also being copied are popular True Religion jeans.
For buyers of Christmas lights, the counterfeiters have even copied the Underwriters Laboratories trademark, which people associate with safe products. But the seized lights are not safe, Mr. Morton said. They have undersize wires and lack replaceable fuses integrated into the plug.
According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the wires in such cases can overheat and start fires.
The safety problems of the seized goods extend well beyond Christmas lights, Mr. Morton said.
''Counterfeit batteries are going to explode, a counterfeit electrical cord might catch fire and burn the house down,'' he said. ''Toys are always a concern. You never know what's going into the actual manufacturing in terms of the chemicals. Obviously you don't know whether they have been tested in terms of, are they safe for toddlers.''
How do you know if you are buying a counterfeit item? A giveaway, customs officials say, is the packaging. Misspellings and bad grammar are common on packages and instructions. Also, obvious poor quality -- like uneven stitching -- should raise suspicions.
The current round of investigations focused on items sold in 66 American and 55 Mexican cities as well as items crossing the border. The items were confiscated from small retailers, swap meets, flea markets, ports and warehouses.
''We want legitimate commerce to prosper between both our nations,'' said Alfredo Gutierrez, director of the Tax Administration Service of Mexico.
The Obama administration has had ''an increased focus on counterfeiting and piracy,'' Mr. Morton said. The number of seizures of counterfeit goods rose 34 percent in 2010 from 2009, to about 19,960. (A big operation includes several seizures -- this one, called Operation Holiday Hoax II, included 170 seizures.)
''We're trying to create a safe and lawful environment around the holiday shopping season,'' Mr. Morton said. Counterfeiters ''don't pay taxes and customs duties, they don't tend to pay health care, they don't tend to invest in the next great product.''
''In a time of great economic distress in many countries, including our own, we need to make sure that we are protecting innovation, jobs, revenue,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Economy Contributes to Slowest Population Growth Rate Since '40s

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The population of the United States grew this year at its slowest rate since the 1940s, the Census Bureau reported on Wednesday, as the gloomy economy continued to depress births and immigration fell to its lowest level since 1991.
The first measure of the American population in the new decade offered fresh evidence that the economic trouble that has plagued the country for the past several years continues to make its effects felt. 
The population grew by 2.8 million people from April 2010 to July 2011, according to the bureau's new estimates. The annual increase, about 0.7 percent when calculated for the year that ended in July 2011, was the smallest since 1945, when the population fell by 0.3 percent in the last year of World War II.
''The nation's overall growth rate is now at its lowest point since before the baby boom,'' the Census Bureau director, Robert M. Groves, said in a statement.
The sluggish pace puts the country ''in a place we haven't been in a very long time,'' said William H. Frey, senior demographer at the Brookings Institution. ''We don't have that vibrancy that fuels the economy and people's sense of mobility,'' he said. ''People are a bit aimless right now.''
Underlying the modest growth was an immigration level that was the lowest in 20 years. The net increase of immigrants to the United States for the year that ended in July was an estimated 703,000, the smallest since 1991, Mr. Frey said, when the immigrant wave that dates to the 1970s began to pick up pace. It peaked in 2001, when the net increase of immigrants was 1.2 million, and was still above 1 million in 2006. But it slowed substantially when the housing market collapsed, and the jobs associated with its boom that were popular among immigrants disappeared.
''Net immigration from Mexico is close to zero, and we haven't seen that in at least 40 years,'' said Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center. ''We are in a very different kind of immigration situation.''
Mr. Passel said that the bulk of the reduction in recent years had been among illegal immigrants, adding that apprehensions at the border are just 20 percent of what they were a decade ago. (The Census Bureau does not ask foreign-born residents their status, but Mr. Passel believes the count includes most people here illegally. )
A lagging birth rate also contributed. Births in the United States declined precipitously during the recession and its aftermath, down by 7.3 percent from 2007 to 2010, according to Kenneth M. Johnson, the senior demographer at the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire. There were slightly over four million births in the year that ended in July, the lowest since 1999.
Economic trauma tends to depress births. In the Great Depression, the birth rate fell by a third, Mr. Johnson said. It is unclear whether the current dip means that births are being delayed or that they are foregone, as they were in the Depression, he said.
In a particularly striking measure of economic distress, birth rates among Hispanics, who are concentrated in states hardest hit by the economic downturn, like Florida and Arizona, declined by 17 percent from 2007 to 2010, Mr. Johnson said. That is compared with a 3.8 percent decline for whites and a 6.7 percent decline for blacks. Rates dropped most sharply among young Hispanics, down by 23 percent for women ages 20 to 24 between 2007 and 2010.
There were bright spots. Florida, which had watched as the decades of robust migration into the state reversed into net declines during the economic downturn, was starting to recover. After net losses of migrants in 2008 and 2009, the state had a net gain of 108,000 newcomers in the year ending in July, Mr. Frey said, the highest since 2006 and a signal that the worst may be behind it.
Neither Arizona nor Nevada, other fast-growing states during the last decade, was so lucky. Nevada's rate of population gain in the year ending in July was about a quarter what it was in the middle of the decade, and Arizona's was about half, Mr. Johnson said.

HEADLINE: European Bank In Strong Move To Loosen Credit

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and DAVID JOLLY; Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
After long resisting the kind of financial force Washington used at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, European central bankers on Wednesday pumped nearly $640 billion into the Continent's banking system. The move raised hopes that the money could alleviate the region's credit squeeze.
Though it is too soon to gauge any longer-term benefits, the move, by the European Central Bank, could be a turning point in the Continent's debt crisis -- a cascading problem that for nearly two years has plagued financial markets around the world and now threatens global economic growth.
American officials and global economists have long urged the Europe's central bank to take just such an aggressive stance -- even as European political leaders have repeatedly failed to devise concrete near-term plans to address Europe's debt problems and deteriorating finances. 
Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at the consulting firm High Frequency Economics and a professed bear on the European outlook, said he was stunned by the size of the monetary operation, saying it suggested that Europe's central bank had ''shown a path toward averting catastrophic collapse in Europe.''
Indeed, some analysts suggest the central bank's new lending program represents a kind of back door to the easy-money policy pursued by the Federal Reserve after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, which is widely credited with averting a broader economic disaster.
The three-year loans the central bank made Wednesday come with a bargain-basement interest rate of 1 percent, providing the region's financial institutions with the kind of cheap financing they can no longer get from the market. Among other requirements, Europe's banks need the money to refinance about a trillion dollars in loans that mature in 2012. Wednesday's infusion could also help reduce the pressure on beleaguered government borrowers on the periphery of the Continent, most significantly Italy and Spain. Those countries have not been able to directly tap European Central Bank funds, even as investors are increasingly reluctant to finance those countries' debt by buying their bonds.
Now, though, by lending to commercial banks at such low rates for three years, the central bank might induce them to use some of the newly available money to buy shorter-term government bonds, which have higher yields, or interest rates. Spain's two-year government bond, for example, is currently yielding 3.64 percent.
Mario Draghi, the central bank's new president, has resisted calls to stand directly behind debtor governments by buying their bonds as necessary, without limit. But the volume of money pumped into the system on Wednesday suggested that Mr. Draghi was prepared to indirectly support those governments through their nation's commercial banks.
''This is exactly what happened in the United States with the Fed in 2008,'' said Mr. Weinberg, the economist. By buying up bad loans and other impaired assets, and lending money to the banks, government officials in the United States were able to buy time for American banks to strengthen their depleted balance sheets.
But in the current case, European officials confront an even trickier situation. Not only must the banks borrow, but indebted European governments have huge borrowing needs of their own, totaling 1.1 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion) in 2012.
Despite those twin threats, German political leaders have opposed any outright bailout either for the banking system or for troubled government borrowers like Italy and Spain, whose free-spending ways have long irked voters in Germany, Europe's largest economy and a principal financier of any bailouts.
If it works, the quiet virtue of the European Central Bank's new lending program will be that it helped buttress banks while easing the pressure on governments -- without the appearance of a direct rescue.
Although the program did not take effect until this week, it was announced on Dec. 8 as part of a broader series of European Central Bank efforts to stabilize anxious credit markets. The central bank said it would offer three-year loans -- rather than the one-year limit it had previously imposed -- and would accept a wider variety of financial assets as collateral, to make it easier for banks to qualify for the loans.
The central bank is accepting the banks' outstanding loans as security, a measure meant to help smaller community banks that might lack conventional forms of collateral like bonds.
''In many ways, it was a success,'' said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. ''But it exposes the E.C.B. to risks linked to the banks because no one knows the quality of the collateral they are providing.''
Until Wednesday's announcement, it was not known how many banks would apply for the new loans or how much they would borrow.
In the end, 523 banks tapped the new program, borrowing 489.2 billion euros, well above the 300 billion euro estimate that market experts had been predicting. Though some of that money includes funds earmarked to replace existing loans, economists estimate that Wednesday's action could inject 190 billion to 270 billion euros, as much as $353 billion, of new money into the European financial system.
The large number of banks that participated is also an indicator that the program has avoided the kind of welfare stigma attached to other types of rescue packages. Because the central bank does not reveal the borrowers' identities, it is not known exactly which banks participated. But Italian banks including UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo borrowed a significant amount, a total of 116 billion euros among them, according to Reuters.
''This is as good as it gets for the banks,'' said Gilles Moec, co-head of economic research for Deutsche Bank. ''It's a big deal.''
He said one crucial test of whether the new approach could address the bigger challenge of easing borrowing conditions for governments would come in February, when Italy has 46 billion euros worth of debt coming due. That same month, the European Central Bank plans to offer banks another round of three-year loans.
Mr. Draghi, despite his earlier opposition to channeling the central bank's loans into government coffers, acknowledged in a speech Monday to the European Parliament that commercial banks might end up doing just that with their new, cheap money. ''We don't know how many government bonds they are going to buy,'' he said.
Strong demand at recent Spanish debt auctions have driven down yields, suggesting that banks were loading up on the debt to use as collateral for the central bank loans, analysts said. But there are limits to their appetites for governments' debt at a time when the banks are trying to reduce their vulnerability to a potential debt default by a big country like Italy, while also protecting themselves against the possibility of a breakup of the euro currency union if the 17 member nation's cannot resolve the crisis.
Pumping new money into an economy is often seen as a textbook ingredient for inflation, if it leads to easy credit for businesses and consumers and a resultant spending spree. But that prospect is widely considered unlikely, at least initially, because Europe appears headed for an economic downturn. A weak economy will discourage much private borrowing.
Mr. Moec said the risk of higher inflation was minimal because ''that would require that the banks were actually making loans to the private sector, and we think that's going to take a while.''

HEADLINE: Social-Minded Hip-Hop Is Making a Comeback

BYLINE: By JON CARAMANICA

 BODY:
In May, when a rapper was invited to perform at the White House as part of an evening devoted to poetry, it was met with predictable conservative outrage. That the kerfuffle was over Common, the most neutered of all rappers, only underscored the bad faith beneath the squawking. Still, the episode was a reminder that rap -- the idea alone -- can still rattle nerves well into its middle age.
This week Common ruffled different conservative feathers when Maya Angelou, who appears on his new album, ''The Dreamer/The Believer'' (Warner Brothers), expressed dissatisfaction that the song she contributed to also features Common's use of a certain racial epithet.
Only conservatives of a certain generation could mistake Common for a firebrand of any sort, though in the context of contemporary hip-hop, his interest in uplift is what really makes him a dissenter. 
Two decades ago, at the outset of his career, those interests didn't set Common apart from his peers; it made him a man of the times. Socially conscious hip-hop was a viable career choice then, a tradition that's been more or less killed, rendered irrelevant with hip-hop's pervasive crossover success.
If there were a time for its comeback, though, it would be now, in the face of occupations, of continued recession, of deflated idealism. And yet current economic realities have made almost no mark on hip-hop this year. Preaching, which would have been a perfectly acceptable mode in the 1990s, would likely be all but ignored in today's hip-hop.
Instead the battle lines have been redrawn in novel ways, and message-driven hip-hop has begun to find a home again, not just on the fringes, but near the center of the genre. Nowhere is that clearer than in the success of Kendrick Lamar, a young rapper from Compton, Calif., and a vivid stylist who's succeeding possibly in spite of his thoughtfulness. Last summer, he released ''Section.80'' (Top Dawg), a startlingly beautiful album that recalls the early- to mid-'90s semiactivist jazz-influenced hip-hop of Digable Planets and, crucially, the Los Angeles underground heroes Freestyle Fellowship, who took their social concerns and created new ways of rapping to reflect them.
In a coincidence of scheduling on Monday night, Common performed at the Highline Ballroom and Mr. Lamar at S.O.B.'s, showing the contrast between being socially minded then and now. There's an ease to Common's presence that's inclusionary; his vision is earnest and open. ''I'm to hip-hop what Obama is to politics,'' Common raps on his new album -- groan. Righteousness is not its own aesthetic reward.
There was something wily about Mr. Lamar during his performance, though. He's an enlightened thinker, but hardly a preacher. Nor is he flamboyant in his beliefs. What he is is committed and savvy, an artist putting his ample charisma in the service of greater ideas. Sometimes he's straightforward -- his song ''No Make-Up (Her Vice)'' is the sort of empowerment anthem that will be familiar to any longtime fan of Common's romantic side. But the songs that received the most enthusiastic response during this show were the difficult ones, like ''A.D.H.D.''
Mr. Lamar evidently enjoys the challenge of bridging worlds. His highest-profile moment this year was probably his arresting guest verse on Drake's ''Take Care,'' on which he talks about the seductions of fame, about needing a strong backbone to hold onto one's principles, and about ultimately giving in. He's a pragmatist and an agitator all in one. He accepts the system as it is, and tries to use it to his advantage. That doesn't necessarily mean that social conscience and financial success are more reconcilable now than they have been in the past, but rather that the ways that they intersect have become trickier and more subtle.
That's less true for the older generation that is still making vital music. ''The Dreamer/The Believer'' is Common's sharpest album in years. Same goes for ''Undun'' (Def Jam), the Roots' new album, which feels like their most purposeful and vibrant work since their mid-'90s heyday. But other recent albums with a strong through-line of social awareness don't feel mired in it in the same way as these albums.
Consider Stalley's lush mixtape ''Lincoln Way Nights: Intelligent Trunk Music,'' which was accessible enough to get him signed to Rick Ross's Maybach Music Group label, or ''Pl3dge'' (Grind Time), the strong album by Killer Mike on which he waxes on about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Oscar Grant and the fragility of the American dream while still retaining the bullying flow that made him famous alongside Outkast a decade ago.
This year has also seen some striking standalone songs, including the police-brutalitycentric take on the Strokes' ''New York City Cops'' by Himanshu Suri of Das Racist, and also the gripping Digable Planets' ''Letter to My Son'' by the Memphis rapper Don Trip, a harrowing first-person narrative about a family broken by mistrust, anger and the legal system. (The bracing YouTube original dates to 2009, and in it Don Trip sets up the camera himself -- it almost feels parodic -- but now it's a full-bodied major label release, with Cee Lo Green singing the soaring chorus.) It belongs alongside the great hip-hop parenting songs like Ed O.G. & Da Bulldogs' ''Be a Father to Your Child'' and Xzibit's ''Foundation.''
Over the summer the blog Dirty Glove Bastard compiled a great Don Trip anthology, ''DGB Presents the Unofficial Best of Don Trip,'' full of thoughtful, deeply felt drug-dealer narratives, locating street economies as part of wider, more pervasive economic and social concerns, a conclusion Don Trip appears to reach with more regret than, say, the Clipse or Young Jeezy.
Whether Don Trip can be more than an Internet favorite remains to be seen. It's notable that the last couple of generations of hip-hop stars have been curiously detached from conversations about social issues almost altogether. That's created a small groundswell of resentment, as seen last summer with the release of ''Watch the Throne,'' Jay-Z and Kanye West's collaborative album, which triggered conversations about how the two stars weren't taking their sociopolitical obligations seriously, even while the album contained some of the most savvy work either of them has ever recorded.
But though Mr. West and Jay-Z have both spoken openly about their politics from time to time, they belong to the category of celebrity for whom equality and progress are important subjects, but are measured in terms that might rattle agitpoppers -- financial to be sure, but also in range of influence and cultural pervasiveness.
The stars that immediately followed them, Lil Wayne and Drake, often feel detached from politics altogether. Lil Wayne is a wordplay obsessive, and his protege Drake digs deep within, but typically has blinders on to the rest of the world -- a politics of one.
That's more or less what Common took Drake to task for on ''Sweet,'' from his new album, in which he effectively called him soft. Not politically insensitive or misogynistic, or anything else that requires taking a stand -- just soft. It's a quixotic choice for Common, whose last high-profile squabble was with Ice Cube, more than 15 years ago, in a face-off with obvious sides and agendas.
But focusing on Drake is a blatant case of parental anxiety, the pot calling the kettle black. An elder on uncertain footing in the hip-hop world, Common looks around for an enemy he recognizes, and finds Drake, who early in his career -- before his breakthrough ''So Far Gone'' mixtape -- showed the clear influence of Common and the Native Tongues.
Even now Drake and Common aren't so different. ''Look What You've Done,'' from ''Take Care,'' is Drake's tender celebration of his mother and his uncle, a moving declaration of the importance of family. In intensity and mood it's reminiscent of the ''Pop's Rap'' songs that Common used to close his early albums with, on which his father would hold forth for a few minutes over jazz piano. Maybe Common forgot: All politics is personal.

HEADLINE: What to Do, and Not Do, About North Korea

BYLINE: By ROBERT L. GALLUCCI. 
Robert L. Gallucci is president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and was the chief negotiator with North Korea during the administration of President Bill Clinton.

 BODY:
Washington
THE death of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, and the ascendance to power of one of his sons, Kim Jong-un, creates some opportunities and potential traps for the administration and senior leaders in the United States -- things they should be sure to say and be sure not to say.
First, we should recognize that we have been here before. Sort of. In 1994, I learned of the death of Kim Il-sung in an early morning telephone call from the South Korean foreign minister. I was in Geneva leading negotiations with the North Koreans over their nuclear weapons program. The first question in the minds of those in Washington and Seoul was how the transition of power in North Korea from father to son would change things -- whether the negotiations would continue, whether it would be business as usual or the beginning of a crisis. We preferred the former and, as it turned out, so did the North. The talks continued and an agreement was signed that stopped the North's plutonium production until we abandoned the deal eight years later, because of the North's cheating with uranium enrichments technology. 
We may be as fortunate this time, even though this son is a lot younger and less experienced than his father was when he assumed authority. The traditional mourning period in Korea is a year, and even Kim Jong-il, who was by then a familiar figure in North Korean power circles, took almost that long before assuming all the leadership positions his own father had held. The lesson here is patience: we should resist drawing conclusions too soon about who is really in charge in North Korea.
Heading the ''do not say'' list for any American leader, or would-be leader, is that this is the time to promote or provoke regime change in North Korea. We used to hear a lot about regime change about a decade ago, with reference to the Axis of Evil, and now the phrase is being resurrected to capture the urge to get rid of North Korea's horrendous totalitarian government.
There may never be a good time to openly advocate the overthrow of the government in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, and certainly the moment when a new young leader may have to decide whether he needs to prove his leadership prowess is definitely not the right time. Insisting on regime change now, as Mitt Romney came very close to doing in a statement on Monday morning, creates no incentive for this government to even consider negotiations, or to contemplate backing off or ever giving up its nuclear weapons program. It is just plain dumb.
What does make sense is to continue to deplore the humanitarian catastrophe that is life in North Korea and to say that we would welcome the day when the government in that country moved toward democratic governance and a free economy.
Among the first things we should tell the North is that we remain prepared to enter discussions aimed at halting, rolling back and ultimately dismantling its nuclear weapons program. This may sound like old news, but it is not. The Obama administration has been sensitive to the domestic political needs of its ally, South Korea, which demand that before proceeding to talks, the United States should obtain some acknowledgement from the North of responsibility for the deaths caused by the sinking of a South Korean ship and the shelling of a South Korean island. The president's advisers have also been sensitive to anticipated criticism from Republicans that initiating talks with the North would represent appeasement, would demonstrate naivete, would amount to buying the same horse twice and would teach the North the wrong lesson.
In the past, the administration has been too sensitive to these domestic considerations. It should now seize an opportunity, if one opens, to resume talks about ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program. To do so would not be appeasement, because little would be given without the North's performance. It would not be naive, since we well understand the North Korean mentality. And it would not be a re-purchase because the last time we talked, we did get much of what we paid for, and we should now be prepared to finish the deal.
Moreover, we should not be in the business of teaching other governments lessons. We should adopt the best policies to protect our national security. Right now, that means entering a serious discussion about the North's nuclear weapons program, aimed at its dismantlement.
Finally, there is an opportunity for the administration to tell the North Koreans something hard and realistic that they desperately need to hear during a transition to new leadership: the United States will not tolerate the transfer to another government or terrorist group of any nuclear weapons material or technology or fissile material, and we will respond with devastating consequences for the North if we learn of such a transfer.
The North's role in the secret construction in Syria of a plutonium production reactor in 2007 should have crossed a red line for the Bush administration. It apparently did not. Had it not been for Israel's version of a nonproliferation policy -- aerial bombardment of the site -- the Middle East might already have been fundamentally changed by the North's outrageous move. Our security is endangered by any such transfers, which make nuclear terrorism and the loss of whole cities entirely plausible. Our government needs to make sure the new government in North Korea never attempts such transfers again.

HEADLINE: For Democrats in Hawaii, Unease in a Once-Dependable Oasis

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
HONOLULU -- Hawaii should be a happy outpost for the Democratic Party. It has a Democratic governor. Democrats overwhelmingly control the Legislature. It has Barack Obama in the White House and all the prestige that brings, most recently an Asia-Pacific economic summit meeting with the president as its host, packing this city's streets, restaurants and hotels with international leaders.
Yet these are hardly happy days for Hawaii Democrats. The governor, Neil Abercrombie, is ending his first year under a storm of criticism; he referred to himself the other evening as ''the most unpopular governor in America.'' Mr. Obama's struggles in Washington have cast a bit of a pall here.
And the Republican Party suddenly has a shot of picking up a United States Senate seat that has been in Democratic hands for more than 30 years, with the announcement by Linda Lingle, a Republican former governor, that she will seek the seat held by Senator Daniel K. Akaka, the retiring Democrat. A Republican victory here would be a serious embarrassment to Mr. Obama (though that could be the least of his problems on election night) and would make it that much more likely that Republicans take back the Senate. 
''Hawaiians want change, and if the Democrats don't offer change, Hawaiians are going to vote for the Republican who offers change,'' Ed Case, a former member of Congress who is seeking the Democratic nomination, said the other day while campaigning here in a sea of leather and roaring motorcycles at the beginning of a Toys for Tots biker parade. ''And Lingle is going to spend $7 million trying to be the change candidate.''
This remains a fiercely Democratic state, and Ms. Lingle, as she acknowledged in an interview, will have to overcome the considerable obstacle of having Mr. Obama, who was born in Honolulu, at the top of the ticket. And for all the problems facing Democrats and the governor, who has struggled with budgetary and personnel issues, there are signs that things might be looking up here: tourism appears to be on the upswing, and Mr. Abercrombie said he had gotten through a difficult first year and begun to turn the state around.
''We're not going to send somebody to the United States Senate whose sole purpose is to undermine the president of the United States, particularly if the majority in the Senate is so slim,'' Mr. Abercrombie said in an interview. ''I think it will be a tough race because the money will come in on the Republican side. And of course, being Democrats, we have a primary contest. At the end of the contest, we'll go as we always have gone here in Hawaii.''
Still, the Republicans have in Ms. Lingle what party officials on both sides say may be the one Republican who could be elected senator from Hawaii. She is well known and is an experienced campaigner with access to huge sums of money. The Democrats are now split by an ideologically caustic primary battle between Mr. Case, who presents himself as a moderate in a party that has swung too far to the left, and Representative Mazie K. Hirono. Mr. Abercrombie's continued political troubles have worsened the atmosphere for Democrats.
''This is the first time since 1977 when we can potentially have a Republican senator,'' said David Chang, the state Republican chairman.
Even during these difficult times, Mr. Obama -- who hopes to come here for the holidays, his second visit to the state in a month -- is viewed as a full-fledged political asset by both Democratic candidates. Notably, Ms. Lingle, in an interview, took pains not to criticize Mr. Obama and made a point of saying she did not think the race should be viewed as a referendum by Hawaii voters on his performance.
Democrats said they would be sure to use videotape of Ms. Lingle campaigning against Mr. Obama in the 2008 presidential election; while Democrats said Mr. Obama's presence here would be welcome by either Democratic candidate, the distance makes it likely that his presence in the campaign will be confined to advertisements, should that prove necessary.
''Obama is a native son: people are going to embrace him,'' said Richard Pratt, a professor of political science at the University of Hawaii.
Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Mr. Obama, who carried Hawaii with 72 percent of the vote in 2008, ''will be a huge factor in this race.''
''We have to make sure that most people who vote for the president also vote for our candidate,'' Mr. Cecil said. ''When we talk about this race, we don't put it in the tossup category, but we're not taking it or granted either.''
Ms. Lingle must also avoid being identified too closely with Republicans in Washington, Democrats and Republicans here said. Her previous electoral success here came when she presented herself as a moderate Republican, appealing to independent voters. That might be tougher in a federal election in which she is being pushed to take positions on issues used to define candidates ideologically: for example, she said she opposed Mr. Obama's call to impose a surtax on income over a million dollars to extend the payroll tax holiday. (At the same time, she has refused to sign a pledge promising never to support any tax increase.)
And Ms. Lingle nominated Sarah Palin as her party's vice presidential candidate at the 2008 Republican National Convention and was a strong supporter of Senator John McCain in his run against Mr. Obama. In her speech, Ms. Lingle echoed many of Mr. McCain's criticisms of Mr. Obama, and Democrats said they would surely use videotape of it in advertisements against her. ''The last time she was on the national stage, she was campaigning very heavily for the McCain-Palin ticket, having introduced Sarah Palin to the world,'' Ms. Hirono said. ''People remember those things.''
Ms. Lingle said those kinds of attacks would not work. ''Anyone who tries to tar me with what's happening at the national level will run up against the reality of my own record in Hawaii,'' she said. ''Every time politicians try to demonize me or someone else, it just shows they have no ideas of their own.''
The Democratic primary has already turned intense and seems likely to tie both candidates up. Mr. Case called Ms. Hirono a ''candidate of the status quo'' and noted his opposition to spending and tax policies she supports, arguing that she could not appeal to independent voters. Ms. Hirono scoffed at Mr. Case's claim and pointed to her broad support in the state. (Democrats in Washington have also made no secret of their hope that she is the nominee.) ''I don't know what Ed even means that I am the status quo,'' she said. ''If people thought that, I wouldn't be getting this kind of support.''
Ms. Lingle's attempt to return to public office is being played out against the problems of Mr. Abercrombie, who succeeded her in office after term limits prevented her from running again. His first year has been marked by a disruptive procession of budget and personnel battles, and a personal style that many of his critics have called unnecessarily abrasive. ''Abercrombie must regain public trust,'' read the headline on a recent editorial in The Honolulu Star-Advertiser.
Mr. Abercrombie said much of the criticism reflected the difficult budget hand he was dealt by Ms. Lingle as she left office. ''I play four quarters,'' he said. ''One year later, it's the end of the first quarter. The objective facts are, we've turned this state around.''
Mr. Pratt said the one thing here that might give Ms. Lingle hope, short of a meltdown in the Democratic primary, would be the governor. ''How Abercrombie does will matter,'' he said, ''and affect the Senate race. And affect the future of the party.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 23, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the changing political landscape in Hawaii misstated the surname of one of the state's Democratic United States representatives at two points. As the article noted, she is Mazie K. Hirono, and in subsequent references should have been identified as Ms. Hirono, not Ms. Mazie.

HEADLINE: Carbon Emission Fees for Flights Upheld

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK; James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.

 BODY:
PARIS -- The European Union's highest court on Wednesday endorsed the bloc's plan to begin charging the world's biggest airlines for their greenhouse gas emissions starting Jan. 1. The move sets the stage for a potentially costly trade war with the United States, China and other countries.
A group of United States airlines had argued that forcing them to participate in the potentially costly emissions-trading system infringed on national sovereignty and conflicted with existing international aviation treaties.
But in a final ruling, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg affirmed an opinion issued in October by its advocate general, who had rejected that claim. 
''The court confirms the validity of the directive that integrates aviation activities in the system for trading emissions quotas,'' the ruling said. It added that the plan ''infringes neither the principles of customary international law at issue, nor the Open Skies agreement'' concluded with the United States in 2007.
The court's decision comes amid increasing pressure from some of the biggest trading partners of the 27-member bloc to suspend or amend application of the legislation to expressly exclude non-European Union countries -- at least initially. Failing that, several governments have vowed to take their own legal action or retaliate with countervailing trade measures.
Although airlines for now will receive most of the permits they will need free, the European Union estimates that ticket prices could rise by as much as 12 euros ($15.65) on some long-haul flights to cover the cost of the additional permits required.
Airlines for America, an industry lobby group and one of the plaintiffs in the case, said that its members would be required to pay more than $3.1 billion to the European Union from 2012 to 2020. It said its members would comply with the system under protest but would also review options for pursuing the case in Britain's High Court, which had referred the original complaint to the European court in 2009.
''The court did not fully address legal issues raised and has established a damaging and questionable precedent,'' the airline group said in a statement.
In a letter dated Dec. 16, Hillary Clinton, the United States secretary of state, and Ray LaHood, the secretary of transportation, said Washington would be ''compelled to take appropriate action'' if Brussels proceeded, though the letter did not specify what form that might take.
In a statement on Wednesday, Krishna R. Urs, the State Department's deputy assistant secretary for transportation affairs, expressed Washington's disappointment but did not broach the subject of retaliation.
''We continue to have strong legal and policy objections to the inclusion of flights by non-E.U. air carriers'' in the system, Mr. Urs said. ''We do not view the court's decision as resolving these objections.''
He added: ''The path the E.U. has chosen is hampering progress towards a multilateral solution that is more likely to bear fruit in terms of concrete progress in limiting greenhouse gas emissions from aviation.''
The court's decision, and the pressure from Washington, leave American airlines in an uncertain legal limbo, particularly following a bill approved this year by the House that would bar them from participating in the European system.
A similar bill was introduced this month in the Senate but was not expected to be brought to a vote until after the new year.
China has also made known its displeasure with the European directive. This year it threatened to suspend purchases of jets made by the European manufacturer Airbus if Chinese airlines were included. A group of Chinese carriers has also threatened to bring a lawsuit, possibly in Germany, where the authorities will oversee the application of the system to several Chinese airlines.
Experts say the Chinese could argue that the European law violates the Kyoto climate agreement by requiring airlines from developing nations, which are exempt from emissions cuts under the treaty, to bear the same burdens as carriers from wealthier nations.
Algeria has already begun a case in France contesting the system, according to the Arab Air Carriers Organization, an industry group that includes the country's main carrier, Air Algerie.
Exempting foreign airlines, however, would anger European carriers that would still be required to participate.
''European airlines and the European economy must not get caught in the political crossfire or be put at a competitive disadvantage,'' Mike Ambrose, director general of the European Regions Airline Association, said. ''If these tensions erupt into full-scale trade conflict, there will be no winners -- least of all the environment.''
The European initiative involves folding aviation into the six-year-old emissions trading system, in which polluters can buy and sell a limited quantity of permits, each representing a ton of carbon dioxide. The legislation requires that airlines account for their emissions for the entirety of any flight that takes off from -- or lands at -- any airport in the bloc.
The goal, European officials have said, is to speed up the adoption of greener technologies at a time when air traffic, which represents about 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, is growing much faster than gains in efficiency.
Governments and airlines have been in negotiations for more than a decade over the creation of a global cap-and-trade system under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization, an arm of the United Nations. The organization's 190 member states passed a resolution in 2010 committing the group to devising a market-based solution, though without a fixed timetable.
Impatient with the pace of those talks, the European Commission moved ahead with its own plan, which was passed two years ago with the support of national governments and the European Parliament.
At an I.C.A.O. meeting last month, 26 member states, including China, Russia and the United States, formally showed their dissatisfaction with the European system -- a sign that they could push for a formal dispute procedure at the organization.
European officials have said repeatedly that they would prefer a multilateral solution and are prepared to amend their cap-and-trade system if and when the I.C.A.O. reaches a global aviation emissions agreement.
The ruling clears the way for the European system to take effect next month. However, airlines will not have to hand over the first batches of emissions permits until the spring of 2013 to compensate for flights made in 2012. That could leave room for a compromise to be negotiated over the next year.
The emissions rules apply from the moment an aircraft begins to taxi from the gate, either en route to or from a European airport, and they cover emissions for the flight from start to finish -- not just the portion that occurs in European airspace.
According to Airlines for America, on a typical flight from San Francisco to Heathrow Airport in London, 29 percent of the total emissions take place in United States airspace. A further 37 percent occurs in Canadian airspace and 25 percent over the high seas. Less than 9 percent of the emissions from such a flight would actually take place in European Union airspace.
In its ruling, the court noted that the European directive did not apply ''as such'' to aircraft flying over the high seas or over the territory of the member states of the European Union or third countries.
''It is only if the operators of such aircraft choose to operate a commercial air route arriving at or departing from an airport situated in the E.U. that they are subject to the emissions trading scheme,'' the court said.

HEADLINE: Housebound for the Holidays

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Right now, you are probably asking yourself: What exactly is going on with Congress? What's all this yelling about a tax increase? Also, are they shutting down the government again? Because I was really planning to spend my Christmas camping out in a national park.
Good news! Congress did not shut down the government this month. It was sort of dancing around the idea, but the country has grown so inured to this kind of behavior that nobody paid any attention. 
Then our lawmakers moved on to a crisis over the payroll tax, unemployment compensation and Medicare. On which they totally dropped the ball.
As things stand now, on Jan. 1, doctors who treat Medicare patients will get a huge cut in pay and the state unemployment compensation systems will be thrown into chaos. People who have been out of work for more than half a year will start falling out of the system in a near-random fashion. Some of those who have been unemployed for 25 weeks will lose their benefits before others who have been collecting for 70.
Also, payroll taxes for Social Security will rise for everybody. That is really unfortunate, but the Medicare and unemployment compensation parts are worse.
On Tuesday, the House majority defeated a bipartisan Senate plan to resolve the problem. They framed the issue as a fight between hard-working Republicans and lazy Democrats/senators who were afraid to give up their vacations in order to stay in Washington for more stimulating debates.
''As a cardiothoracic surgeon, I often worked through the holidays!'' said Representative Larry Bucshon of Indiana.
Representative Charles Boustany Jr. of Louisiana, another doctor, regaled the members with the story of a Christmas Eve when ''I was getting ready to sit down for dinner with my family when I got called to see an 85-year-old Cajun gentleman, with a very large family, who had a ruptured aneurysm, and he was in shock. I spent the entire night operating on this man.''
''My three employees -- Irv, Dirk and Larry -- they're all at work today!'' said Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican and the co-owner of Huizenga Gravel.
It does seem a little unfair to bring Irv, Dirk and Larry into the fight, because they probably are not required to spend their free time raising donations for the next election season.
This battle goes back to 2010, when President Obama made a deal to continue the dreaded Bush tax cuts in return for a yearlong payroll tax cut, which benefits lower-income workers, and extended federal benefits for the unemployed.
The House Republicans never loved the second part of the deal, and, in the spirit of the season, I will not suggest that this was because they only like tax cuts for rich people.
Anyhow, earlier this month, the House did pass a bill extending the tax cut for another year. Perhaps coincidentally, it was also packed with things that the Senate Democrats were bound to hate, from freezing the pay of federal employees to doing something to environmental regulations of boilers that I could not possibly explain to you if I had a week.
When the bill made its way to an unwelcoming Senate, a miracle occurred. Angels sang, a star rose in the east and the Democrats and Republicans worked out a compromise. This was, admittedly, an old-fashioned Congressional compromise that resembled the offspring of a wart hog and vampire bat. But it kept the status quo going for another two months.
Happiness reigned! Most of the Republican senators voted for the bill, and everybody started packing for vacation.
Alas, the compromise flamed the fiercest rancor and resentment that exists on Capitol Hill -- the hatred of the House for the Senate. Really, no matter who's in charge in Washington, the House hates the Senate. The House hated the Senate when James Monroe was in it.
The Republican House members had a meeting. According to The Washington Post, a number of members begged to be allowed to fight to the death for their original plan in the manner of the movie ''Braveheart.'' The idea that people were demanding that their leaders act like Mel Gibson should give you an idea of how out of control things had gotten.
So the House rejected the Senate compromise, while arguing that vacations are for sissies. ''We are not afraid to vote!'' cried Representative Allen West, a freshman Republican from Florida.
West was having an action-packed day, fending off a resolution condemning him for saying ''if Joseph Goebbels was around, he'd be very proud of the Democrat Party because they have an incredible propaganda machine.''
People, did we not have an agreement that politicians were going to stop comparing each other to the Nazis?
Really, sometimes it seems as though nothing can ever get done. Even if you'll settle for a mutant wart hog-vampire bat.

HEADLINE: A New Kim. A New Chance?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
On my first trip to North Korea in 1989, I made a nuisance of myself by randomly barging into private homes. I wanted to see how ordinary North Koreans actually live, and people were startled but hospitable.
The most surprising thing I found was The Loudspeaker affixed to a wall in each home. The Loudspeaker is like a radio but without a dial or off switch. In the morning, it awakens the household with propaganda. (In his first golf outing, Comrade Kim Jong-il shoots five holes-in-one!) It blares like that all day.
The Loudspeaker underscores that North Korea is not just another dictatorship but, perhaps, the most totalitarian country ever. Stalin and Mao were murderous but low-tech; the Kim family added complex systems of repression. 
Anyone disabled is considered an eyesore, for example. So people with disabilities are often expelled from the capital, Pyongyang.
Government propaganda is shameless. During a famine, North Korean news media warned starving citizens against overeating by recounting the cautionary tale of a man who ate his fill, and then exploded.
Once in North Korea, I stopped in a rural area to interview two high school girls at random. They were friendly, if startled. So was I when they started speaking simultaneously and repeating political lines in perfect unison. They could have been robots.
When videos (of movies, music or religion) began to be smuggled in from China, police began to turn off the power to entire buildings. Then the police would go door to door and examine what video was stuck inside players. A smuggled tape could mean the dispatch of an entire family to a labor camp.
What do we make of this country? For Americans, a starting point should be to recognize some failures of American policy. A few lessons:
Don't assume that the end of the regime is imminent.
I've been covering North Korea on and off since 1987, and outsiders have always been whispering about rumored uprisings or suggesting that the government is on its last legs. Yes, North Korea's regime could collapse tomorrow -- or it could stagger along for another 20 years. The ''Great Successor'' Kim Jong-un could outlast President Obama.
Don't assume that everybody detests the regime.
All those North Koreans crying because of Kim Jong-il's death? Their grief is probably sincere. In conversations with North Korean defectors, I'm struck by how many lambaste the Kim regime but add that their relatives left behind still believe in it -- because they know nothing else. Many also are passionate nationalists, preferring a homegrown despot to any hint of foreign economic colonialism.
Faith and fear combine to keep people in line. In a book about North Korea, Bradley Martin tells how one of Kim Jong-il's aides told his wife about his boss's womanizing. The wife truly believed in the basic decency of the North Korean system and wrote to the leadership to protest the debauchery. The letter was passed on to Kim Jong-il, who brought the woman in front of a crowd and denounced her.
Her own husband then stepped forward, pleading to be allowed to execute her. This request was granted, and the husband then shot his wife to death.
Don't try to isolate North Korea.
The West has reacted to North Korean's nuclear program by sanctioning and isolating the country. But isolation has mostly backfired. It's one of the things that keeps the Kim family in power, and we're helping enforce it.
Moreover, economic pain is not going to destroy the regime. In the mid-1990s, perhaps one million people died in famine, and the regime was unhurt.
Our failures in North Korea are manifest. In 1994, we came close to war on the Korean Peninsula, averting it with a nuclear deal that rested on false hope: The Clinton administration thought the regime would collapse before the West had to deliver civilian nuclear reactors as its part of the agreement.
Confronted with evidence of cheating by North Korea, the Bush administration then backed out of the deal. The result was even more disastrous: North Korea accelerated its nuclear assembly line and accumulated enough plutonium for perhaps eight weapons.
American officials blame China for coddling North Korea, but at least Beijing has a strategy. It is to encourage the Kim regime to replicate the opening and reform policies that transformed China itself. These days, Chinese traders, cellphones, DVDs and CDs are already common in border areas of North Korea, doing more to undermine Kim rule than any policy of the United States.
There are no good solutions. But let's take advantage of the leadership transition to try a dose of outreach. If we can inch toward diplomatic relations, trade and people-to-people exchanges, we're not rewarding a monstrous regime. We just might be digging its grave.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Hopefuls Finesse Fight on Payroll Tax

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Trip Gabriel contributed reporting from Des Moines, and Ashley Parker from Keene, N.H.

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- The wounds may have healed from his ferocious budget battles with the last Democratic president, but Newt Gingrich's memory is vivid. And he believes one lesson still holds true about the fights between Congress and the White House: presidents generally win.
It was with that sentiment in mind on Wednesday that Mr. Gingrich waded -- reluctantly -- into the latest partisan clash in Washington that has left many Republicans worrying whether they are landing on the wrong side of a tax argument with Democrats. 
''Incumbent presidents have enormous advantages,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''Republicans ought to do what's right for America. They ought to do it calmly and pleasantly and happily, and over time people are smart and will figure this stuff out.''
The Republican presidential candidates have built their campaigns around a sharp critique of President Obama and Democrats in Congress. But their footing seemed far less certain with the contentious back-and-forth on Capitol Hill suddenly involving an internal Republican feud over the extension of a payroll tax break and jobless pay -- especially at a time when Congress's approval ratings are far below those of the president.
As he opened a three-day bus tour in New Hampshire, Mitt Romney noted that he was not willing to get into the ''Congressional sausage-making process.'' And Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who did not return to Washington for the vote on the tax bill, declared in a round of television interviews from Iowa, ''There's a real lack of leadership in Washington.''
The Republican field was out in full force on Wednesday. The candidates scrambled trying to win over undecided voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. Yet the frenzy of activity on one of the busiest days of the campaign season so far only reinforced a seldom-spoken truth about running for president: applying for the job often bears little reality to the actual duties of office.
With more than three million Americans on the cusp of losing unemployment insurance benefits because of an impasse in Congress, and all workers on the brink of losing a payroll-tax break, the presidential candidates broached the subject only when they were asked about it by reporters. And even then, they blamed Mr. Obama and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, rather than take sides in the standoff between House and Senate Republicans.
Mr. Gingrich did not seem eager to weigh in, despite his own experience of a similar budget battle in 1995 and 1996 that escalated into a government shutdown that benefited President Bill Clinton. But the subject was unavoidable as he stood before reporters here at the Iowa State Capitol, where he called a news conference to trumpet the endorsements of the House speakers from Iowa and New Hampshire.
''I'm not trying to micromanage or second-guess the Congress,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''I don't pay enough attention. I'm like a normal American. I read your headline and go, 'O.K., got it,' and go on to the next stop.''
The look on Mr. Gingrich's face seemed only slightly less pained than it was a few moments earlier when an event intended to show his strength in the two early-voting states -- his campaign flew William O'Brien, the speaker of the New Hampshire House, here to Iowa -- was disrupted by protesters. Mr. Gingrich had waited patiently as a handful of demonstrators shouted, ''Put people first.'' After they were led away, a roomful of reporters asked him whether the stalemate over extending the payroll tax break would be damaging to the Republican Party, as such influential voices like The Wall Street Journal editorial page suggested.
''In terms of the presidential election, it's noise,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''It's fairly hard for a legislative branch to outperform a president in communications.''
Mr. Gingrich said that he favored a one-year extension of the payroll tax cut, as House Republicans are advocating. He assailed the Senate, whose own version of the legislation passed with the support of 39 Republicans, for an ''absurd dereliction of duty'' and ''game playing.'' He refrained from offering any counsel to Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, whose Republican caucus balked at the Senate bill. Then, Mr. Gingrich said: ''I have no idea how I would try to handle it if I were in John Boehner's position.''
As he prepared to fly to New Hampshire to pick up his campaigning there, he allowed that there was plenty of blame to go around. ''I think this is an example of why people are sick of Washington and sick of politics,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''Obama is so inept as a president, and the Congress is so dysfunctional as an institution that we are lurching from failure to failure to failure in a way that I think the American people find very, very disheartening to think that their leadership cannot get together and be mature.''
He was not alone in his reluctance to choose sides in the Republican argument.
Mr. Romney, who is locked in a tough fight for the party's presidential nomination and is seeking to gain the support of a wide spectrum of Republicans, also did not raise the issue until he was asked by reporters as he campaigned in New Hampshire.
''As you know, I happen to support the idea of extending the payroll tax holiday,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I don't think this is going to change the economy, but it's certainly going to help a lot of people in tough times. In this Obama economy, this is the last time to raise taxes. We don't want to raise taxes at a time like this.''
But he declined to say whether he supported the House Republican position to reject the two-month extension, which had the overwhelming support of Senate Republicans. Asked directly if he disagreed with Mr. Boehner, he replied: ''I just told you my position. I did not say that, so I'm not going to say that I said that.''
He added, ''How they make that work is something they're going to have to decide amongst themselves.'' With that, he turned the conversation back to a topic that he and other Republicans are eager to talk about: Mr. Obama.

HEADLINE: Tax Battle With G.O.P. Gives a Lift To Obama

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After a long stretch of high unemployment, legislative turmoil and, in turn, slipping public approval, President Obama seemed to regain his political footing this week with the help of House Republicans, whose handling of a standoff over payroll taxes had even leading conservatives accusing them of bungling the politically charged issue.
At stake were continued payroll tax cuts for 160 million workers and aid for several million long-term unemployed Americans that expire Dec. 31. The holiday brinkmanship over the issue recalled the December budget showdown 16 years ago between another first-term Democratic president, Bill Clinton, and a new Republican Congressional majority -- a fight that capped their year of confrontation over the nation's fiscal priorities by reviving Mr. Clinton politically as he began his re-election race.
But the impasse was not without risks for Mr. Obama. Democrats fretted that Mr. Obama's vow to stay in Washington through Christmas and New Year's to get a deal would backfire should he join his family in Hawaii before a resolution. Also, though House Republicans were bearing the brunt of criticism for the latest show of Washington dysfunction, Mr. Obama could be hurt if the tax break and jobless aid are not extended and the fragile economy sours, as nonpartisan economic forecasters have warned it will without the continued stimulus measures. 
And while even other Republicans were predicting that the House Republicans would have to blink, or risk further political damage, the ugliness of the fight reminded Americans yet again of the seeming futility of Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign promise to make Washington work as the year of his re-election race is upon him.
By Wednesday most lawmakers had scattered for the holidays. Yet party leaders remained behind, standing their ground and trying to shift blame to the other side. A 10-minute phone conversation between Mr. Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner was apparently fruitless, according to aides to both, and afterward each side described the call on its own terms.
Mr. Obama called Mr. Boehner shortly after noon and urged him to have the House reconsider and approve the compromise two-month extension of the payroll tax cut and unemployment assistance that Senate Democrats and Republicans overwhelmingly approved over the weekend with Mr. Obama's support. House Republicans rejected that compromise on Tuesday and demanded negotiations toward a full-year measure to keep most workers' Social Security payroll tax at 4.2 percent, down from 6.2 percent.
According to a White House account, Mr. Obama told Mr. Boehner the bipartisan Senate bill ''is the only option to ensure that middle-class families aren't hit with a tax hike in 10 days and gives both sides the time needed to work out a full-year solution.''
But Mr. Boehner reiterated that House Republicans want a full-year extension like they approved earlier this month, though their measure did not have the president's or the Senate's support, largely because of unrelated provisions that House Republicans attached and because it would cut unemployment aid from current levels.
The speaker told Mr. Obama that the House Republican majority ''was elected to change the way Washington does business and that we should not waste the next 10 days simply because it is an inconvenient time of year,'' a Boehner aide recounted. According to the aide, who declined to be identified discussing the private call, Mr. Boehner told Mr. Obama, ''Let's get this done today.''
Because the Senate compromise had offered a bipartisan way out of the knot until the parties could negotiate a long-term fix in January -- the Senate passed the temporary measure by a vote of 89 to 10, with 39 Republicans in support -- House Republicans by their rejection of it drew fire not only from Democrats but from Senate Republicans and conservative pundits.
They awoke to an editorial in The Wall Street Journal, a beacon of conservative thought, headlined ''The G.O.P.'s Payroll Tax Fiasco'' and blaming House Republicans for not only squandering their party's advantage on tax issues but also potentially helping to re-elect Mr. Obama. The theme was echoed among conservatives in the blogosphere.
With Republicans criticizing each other, Mr. Obama stayed out of the public eye except for a brief Christmas shopping foray.
Mr. Boehner, who last week had tried unsuccessfully to get his party to compromise, held a news conference with the Republicans he had appointed as negotiators to a nonexistent legislative conference committee. They faced 10 empty chairs meant to represent the missing Democrats. ''We're here,'' he said. ''We're ready to work.''
But as even some conservatives were pointing out, the House Republicans' attempts to seize the political high ground by advocating for a full-year payroll tax cut are undercut by their shifting stands in the months leading up to the showdown.
Mr. Obama first proposed in September, as part of his larger jobs creation package, to extend for another year the two-percentage-point payroll tax cut that he and Congressional Republicans had agreed to last December. A year ago Republicans had agreed to the cut and continued unemployment compensation in 2011 only after Mr. Obama agreed to support an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts on high incomes, which were due to expire after 2010, for two years through 2012.
This fall, Republicans initially said they would oppose an extension, arguing against any further temporary stimulus measures. Then they said they would support an extension if the cost were offset by spending cuts, not the higher taxes on the wealthy that Mr. Obama proposed. When Mr. Obama hammered them in speeches around the country for risking a tax increase for most Americans to protect the wealthy few, many Republicans explained their opposition as a stand to protect Social Security's revenues. Then they proposed their own payroll tax cut, which, like the Democrats' version, would transfer general revenues into Social Security's accounts to make up the loss.
On Wednesday, more Senate Republicans spoke out to urge House Republicans to accept the extension. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who faces re-election in 2012, said on CNBC: ''Are Republicans getting killed now in public opinion? There's no question.'' He echoed others, including Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, in publicly calling on House Republicans to back down.
Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader who negotiated the two-month compromise with the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, has been largely silent, in effect standing by his deal and letting House Republicans stew in the controversy. Mr. McConnell believed he had Mr. Boehner's backing for whatever deal he won, lawmakers say, but House Republicans rebelled when Mr. Boehner presented it to them on a Saturday afternoon conference call.
Polls this week suggest that the issue has helped Mr. Obama while keeping Congress's ratings with the public at record lows.
Polls for The Washington Post-ABC News and for CNN showed nearly half of Americans approve of the job Mr. Obama is doing, up from percentages that have been in the low 40s this year except for a brief rise after the killing of Osama bin Laden. In the Post-ABC poll, Mr. Obama had reversed Republicans' edge in an October poll on who is more trusted on the issue of taxes.
The results contrast with polls after the summer standoff over raising the nation's debt limit, when both Mr. Obama and Republicans saw their support slide after reaching a deal in August. Mr. Obama's slippage in part reflected defections from his party base; Democrats objected he had ''caved'' to secure Republicans' support for an increase in the nation's borrowing limit, without which the United States might have defaulted on its debts and provoked a global crisis.
But the August deal, in extending the debt limit through 2012, freed Mr. Obama to mount a more aggressive and populist pitch for his job creation agenda because the consequences of gridlock are not so dire. While advisers say the recent polls affirm that strategy is working, Mr. Obama's ratings for his handling of the economy remain low.

HEADLINE: Finding Success in a Lifelong Passion for Fighting Monopolies

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Albert A. Foer, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, was enjoying a restful Sunday last March when news broke that AT&T was seeking to buy T-Mobile USA.
Dismayed by the possible blockbuster cellphone merger, Mr. Foer rushed to the institute's global headquarters -- the first-floor study of his Washington home -- and swung into action.
He complained to a reporter that ''AT&T was broken up and now it's back with a vengeance.'' In the ensuing weeks, his organization would send a letter to the Senate, submit a lengthy objection to the Federal Communications Commission and issue a 38-page white paper arguing that the merger would ''result in higher prices, lower quality, less innovation and fewer choices for consumers and businesses.''
Faced with fierce opposition from the Obama administration, the two companies scrapped their $39 billion deal on Tuesday, handing Mr. Foer and his fellow antitrust-enforcement advocates a major victory. 
''Of course we can't claim credit for putting an end to the merger,'' said Robert H. Lande, a director at the institute and a law professor at the University of Baltimore. ''But we did our part, and this was a wonderful demonstration of how the system sometimes works exactly the way it is supposed to work.''
In a city swarming with corporate lobbyists and business interests, the American Antitrust Institute is a rare species. The nonprofit group argues for more vigilant enforcement of the antitrust laws, fighting mergers that it believes harm competition and countering the evils of cartels.
Since its inception in 1998, the organization has largely operated in an environment of lax antitrust regulation. The Bush administration is considered to have had a weak record in policing mergers and bringing monopolization cases. And courts over the last decade have generally cut back on the scope of antitrust liability.
But with the government's opposition to the AT&T-T Mobile deal and investigations like the one into Google's business practices, the Obama administration appears to be reinvigorating antitrust enforcement.
''We've been paying defensive ball the entire time,'' Mr. Foer said. ''It's nice to see a bit of a momentum shift.''
Despite its grandiose name, the American Antitrust Institute is nothing more than a virtual network of 120 competition-policy experts around the globe. The organization's tools are somewhat limited. It submits friend-of-the-court filings in legal cases, called amicus briefs; publishes papers and book-length treatises; and hosts symposiums on arcane topics like multichannel distribution in the Internet age.
The institute's secret weapon is Mr. Foer, an indefatigable 67-year-old lawyer with a broad, gap-toothed smile who speaks about tying arrangements and predatory pricing the way most people discuss football and reality TV.
''A lot of Bert's antitrust opinions are annoying,'' said R. Hewitt Pate, the general counsel of Chevron and a former senior antitrust official in the Bush administration. ''You disagree with him on the substance but you enjoy hanging out with him, and there are not enough people in Washington like that.''
While well known in antitrust circles, Mr. Foer is not nearly as famous as his children. He and his wife, Esther Safran Foer, are the parents of three accomplished writer sons.
There is Franklin, 37, a former editor of The New Republic who is at work on a book about American liberalism; Jonathan, 32, whose novel, ''Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,'' is the basis for a Warner Brothers movie set for a Christmas release; and Joshua, 29, a winner of the National Memory Championships and whose book about the science of memory, ''Moonwalking With Einstein,'' was among this year's most acclaimed nonfiction books.
Though a proud father -- interviewed last week, he was still beaming from having attended the ''Extremely Loud'' premiere the night before -- Mr. Foer is reticent to discuss his children.
''What I'll say is that you can screw up your kids,'' he said. ''And that's our achievement -- we didn't screw them up.''
Mr. Foer's interest in antitrust was piqued at the University of Chicago Law School, where he studied under Richard A. Posner and Ronald H. Coase, two leading scholars who promoted a laissez-faire approach to economics that is suspicious of government involvement.
''And I've been criticizing the Chicago School ever since,'' Mr. Foer said.
After three years at the law firm Hogan & Hartson, Mr. Foer joined the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition. He spent six years there, largely working on policy issues.
In 1983, while back in private practice, Mr. Foer's legal career took a detour. His father had a heart attack, rendering him unable to run the family business, Melart Jewelers. Mr. Foer took over the 15-store Washington-area chain. He ran it for 13 years, and with the company struggling in the mid-'90s, Mr. Foer sold it to a competitor in a fire sale.
''Was I passionate about jewelry?'' Mr. Foer said. ''No, and that was my failing.''
At 50, Mr. Foer had to find a job. After casting about for several years, he returned to antitrust. At the time, although the government was bearing down on Microsoft's monopolistic power, Mr. Foer saw the need for an organization that would pressure the government to toughen its antitrust stance.
A friend introduced him to Ralph Nader, the consumer rights activist, who encouraged Mr. Foer and helped him get his idea off the ground. A major hurdle was raising money, but Mr. Foer soon discovered that certain companies wanted to help him.
''There are always two sides in an antitrust case, and one is normally aligned with consumers,'' he said. ''That side ended up giving us money.''
Oracle, which was waging war with Microsoft, wrote the organization one of its first significant checks. A few years later, when the online travel service Orbitz was the subject of an antitrust inquiry, its competitor, Travelocity, gave the institute financial support.
Another source of financing comes from judges distributing unclaimed money from antitrust class-action settlements. The organization has received several million dollars under a legal doctrine called cy pres, which allows courts to dispense leftover cash in class-action lawsuits to benefit public interest programs.
Last month, it received about $900,000 from the settlement fund of an antitrust litigation against the credit card companies.
Today, the American Antitrust Institute runs on a budget of less than $1 million a year. Including Mr. Foer, five people are on the payroll, all of them working out of their homes, from Boston to Boulder. They pay themselves ''good civil service salaries,'' Mr. Foer said.
Even with the government's recent stepped-up efforts in antitrust, Mr. Foer and his colleagues haven't let up. This week, Diana Moss, the group's senior research fellow, wrote an opinion article arguing that a proposal by Delta and US Airways to swap landing slots at New York and Washington airports put consumers at risk for higher fares. Last month, it urged the F.T.C. to block the merger between Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions.
''At its root, antitrust is about human dignity and making sure consumers have a range of choices,'' Mr. Foer said.
His son Frank said that he had realized ever since he was a child that antitrust was the defining passion of his father's life. That notion came to the fore this year when he visited his father in a hospital recovery room after an operation. He was just waking up from anesthesia.
''We got the bastards,'' Mr. Foer said groggily.
His family looked at one another, perplexed, and asked what he was talking about.
''I was just in the middle of an antitrust proceeding and we got the bastards,'' he said.
The moment, said Frank, perfectly expressed his father's id.
''The guy's just coming out of surgery, and he's not thinking about his wife and children,'' Frank said. ''He's thinking about antitrust.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Dec. 22, 1864 | Gen. Sherman Offers Savannah as a 'Christmas Gift' to President Lincoln

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On Dec. 22, 1864, as the Civil War entered its final months, Union Gen. William T. Sherman sent a message to President Lincoln notifying him that he had captured the city of Savannah, Ga., thereby completing his 300-mile "March to the Sea" that had begun in Atlanta the month before. 

 BODY:
On Dec. 22, 1864, as the Civil War entered its final months, Union Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman sent a message to President Lincoln notifying him that he had captured the city of Savannah, Ga., thereby completing his 300-mile "March to the Sea" that had begun in Atlanta on Nov. 16.
Sherman's message was published in the Dec. 26 edition of The New York Times. It read, "I beg to present you as a Christmas gift, the city of Savannah, with one hundred and fifty heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, and also about twenty-five thousand bales of cotton."
Sherman, who had captured Atlanta in September 1864, believed that advancing across the state to Savannah would be effective as a form of psychological warfare, demonstrating to Southerners that their army could not protect them from the invading troops. He employed a "scorched earth policy" to inflict maximum psychological, economic and tactical damage to the Confederacy. His troops destroyed farms and plantations, burned down food stores and twisted railroad tracks. He left a trail of destruction that devastated Southern morale.
Sherman's troops faced light resistance along the march, fighting only one significant battle before reaching the outskirts of Savannah on Dec. 10. Savannah was well defended, but on Dec. 13, a Union division under William B. Hazen captured Fort McAllister, on the coastline south of Savannah. It allowed Sherman's men to link up with Navy ships holding supplies. Sherman prepared a siege of Savannah and the Confederate forces escaped, forcing the city to surrender to Sherman on Dec. 21.
President Lincoln wrote back to Sherman in a letter dated Dec. 26: "Many, many thanks for your Christmas-gift - the capture of Savannah. When you were about leaving Atlanta for the Atlantic coast, I was anxious, if not fearful; but feeling that you were the better judge, and remembering that 'nothing risked, nothing gained' I did not interfere. Now, the undertaking being a success, the honor is all yours."
After Savannah, Sherman's troops marched north through the Carolinas, again destroying everything in their path, including the South Carolina capital of Columbia. Sherman's tactics remain one of the most controversial subjects of the war. His critics argue that he brought unnecessary destruction and hardship upon the Southern people. His defenders maintain that he used legitimate military means to bring about the end of the war.

The "scorched earth policy," a tactic calling for the destruction of food and supplies by an invading or retreating army, is banned under Article 54 of the Geneva Conventions. Nevertheless, the strategy has been used in recent conflicts, including in Darfur and Libya.
Why do you think the strategy of destroying the food supply of the civilian population in an area of conflict is prohibited by the Geneva Conventions? What are the ethical implications and consequences of employing "scorched earth"? In your opinion, are there situations in which using such a tactic can be justified? Why or why not?

HEADLINE: A Conversation With: Sachin Pilot

BYLINE: HEATHER TIMMONS


HIGHLIGHT: The Internet should no longer reflect a 1950s view of the world, with America making the rules, the Minister says. 

 BODY:
In recent months the Indian government held meetings with Internet intermediaries like Facebook and Google, and asked them to prescreen user content and remove things that might be incendiary or objectionable, inspiring an outpouring of complaint and a rebuff from these companies. On Dec. 15, the government appeared to step down from that position, telling these companies in a meeting that there would be no censorship of Internet content. 
India Ink sat down with Sachin Pilot, the minister of State for Communications and Information Technology, to discuss the Indian government's views on freedom of speech on the Internet. 
Q.
Can you clarify for us what the Indian government's position is on reviewing or curbing content on the Internet? 
A.
We do not believe or think that censorship is the way forward for any of the issues on the table. 
But clearly there has to be, and there is, a mechanism for the social media companies and sites to address issues of individuals of companies and individuals when they come about. We clearly have urged them to make the system more robust, so that not just the well-known personalities and people who are famous who have access can get to a position where their issues are resolved, but the common user, the net citizen has a redressal mechanism. 
Most Web sites have them but how robust and how functional they are that needs to be looked into. 
On objectionable content, that's a debate that has been going on not just in India but around the world. In the last eight or nine years, we as a country we have only shut down 14 Web sites. 
Censorship has never been on the table. All of these companies were just asked to become participative stakeholders to see how we can resolve these issues because people have come up and said this is perhaps not appropriate or appropriate. 
We have guidelines and laws in place already, so there is nothing new that has to be done about this. 
Q.
*** Q: So you're not using the word pre-screen anymore? Is that something that these companies will no longer be asked to do? 
A.
 I think there were many things talked about how to deal with this stuff and it was just a discussion. We continue to have that discussion. Somehow the media just really came out and perhaps it was not understood as well we hoped it would be. 
Q.
I think people understood what was being said, they just thought it was a terrible idea. 
A.
The attempt was never to have a curb on anything. 
Don't forget we have 100 million-plus Internet users in this country, which is still less than 10 percent of the population. In India, the Internet exposure is going to grow exponentially. As we move into that space, people, youngsters, everyone, must become responsible users of that space. 
I think the Internet really offers you the best platform to say whatever you want, and you've seen our media, it cannot be more robust. The same applies to the Internet. 
There were some complaints we received from some organizations and groups, and we directed them to these companies. The companies are now a bit more sensitive to the needs and expectations of users. 
Q.
So do you think the rules that these companies themselves have are strong enough and are well enough enforced?
A.
Well, we have a set of rules in this country. 
Q.
Which go far beyond the rules these companies have. 
A.
Right. These companies have to operate in this country, they have to abide like any other company within the rules of the sovereign state. There is no ambiguity on that front. 
We have said that on the Internet there should be a redressal system, for a thing like identity theft, things like online fraud - if someone is distressed, how does he or she get her point across? 
This involves combined issues, it isn't just about content. 
Q.
People have argued that the rules passed in April are curbing free speech in India. What would you say to that? 
A.
I don't think that assessment is fair at all. We have free speech and we respect it, I think it is one of the greatest things we have in this country. People are allowed to say exactly what they want. 
As I said at the beginning, though, if someone is doing something just with the intent of causing harm, I think you've seen some of the photographs and other content that is being made available, it is perhaps hurtful to someone, perhaps not, but the fact is that whether it is the companies or the government or the users, there needs to be some responsible learning curve for people who are beginning to use the Internet this decade. 
There is no question of putting curbs on it, I mean, it's impossible to do that, this is the Internet. It has helped this country more than it has most parts of the world, when we're talking about e-commerce, electronic delivery of services. Our country, our GDP, has the most to gain from it. A 10 percent increase in broadband increase GDP by 1.4 percent, this from a U.N. study. 
There is absolutely no intent of anyone to restrict or censor anything that's available on the Internet. But, yes, we did pass a law about child pornography, that's been made illegal.
Q.
But that's already illegal, and against these companies rules. 
A.
Yes, a company can have its own guidelines and rules, but we as a country also need to have our regulations. So we believe that child pornography is illegal and should not be put on the 'net and we put that in the April rules. 
Q.
Can we talk about jurisdiction? When Kapil Sibal held his Dec. 6 press conference he did say, basically, "We will be looking at content on the Internet no matter where it comes from, no matter who has written it, which might offend Indian sensibilities." 
A.
When he said we, I don't think he meant the government. I think we all, as users of the Internet, whether companies, individuals, or officials or bureaucrats, we as a country should just be more responsible in how we behave on the Internet. 
There's nothing wrong with expecting people to be more responsible. 
Q.
People who attended these meetings between Minister Sibal and Internet companies got the impression that what really upset the government was people saying things about Congress party members. 
A.
That's not true, no. I was not there for the meetings, by the way, but if you see the statements of all these companies, they seem very, very cooperative. They understand the standpoint we projected. 
I had a meeting with them afterwards, about how we can use these platforms for the government to reach out to people, whether its Tweeting or Facebooking or whatever it is. 
These are instruments we must harness, even though everything has or perhaps could have a downside to it. Everything in the world does. For us it is best to have the power and foresight to leverage the good aspects of what is offered. 
For us, cheap, easy, reliable access to the Internet is the way forward, and not just in English. I have been pushing for the last two years to have regional language content available on the Internet. Soon all languages in India will have domain names. 
Why would anyone want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg? 
Q.
What has happened with the nodal agency that had been discussed, potentially to be headed by (director general of India's cyber security agency) Gulshan Rai, to look for content on the Internet that might be objectionable? 
A.
There is no plan to set up a nodal agency to look for offensive content. No such statement has ever been made by Minister Sibal or anyone in the government. There is no proposal to regulate or monitor any content. The existing rules provide adequate legal framework for dealing with such cases. 
Can I just add - as a member of the government and an Indian citizen, if there is a some wrongful depiction of the Indian map, parts of J&K, parts of the northeast, now we're going to make sure that does not happen. An inaccurate depiction of our boundaries is a serious issue, and no one should make the mistake of thinking we're going to be O.K. with it. 
I'm not saying just take my point of view, but what is the global accepted norms of the borderline depiction, whether it's the U.N. or other agencies that is what has to be followed. 
Q.
Do you think the "sensibilities" of the Indian people are different than those of, say, Americans? Is it easier to offend here? 
A.
It is very difficult to categorize. The Chinese are different than the Russians than the Japanese than the Americans than the Indians. But on the Internet it's all zeros and ones - it's one of the great levelers. I think you're trying to highlight the point that it's perhaps easier to get people to be sensitive, or people are more sensitive in this part of the world. Is that the issue? 
Q.
Well that seemed to be what Minister Sibal was saying. 
A.
 The point that Minister Sibal was making was also not factually incorrect. We are 1.2 billion people with a whole variety of ethnicities and language and culture and upbringing and 1,000 years of history, different castes, whatever. People have a different view every 10 kilometers, yet we're all Indians as a nation. 
Does that necessarily mean that people are more sensitive? Maybe, maybe not. That's open to judgment. But as far as the rules are concerned, as far as the government is concerned, that is clear as day. 
Q.
These Internet companies are all American, and they seem to rely on the American definition of what is allowed, free speech-wise, and they're exporting that around the world. Here in India and in other democracies, as well, that has been running into friction recently. 
A.
There is a difference. Singapore is a democracy, so is America, so is India, so is Iraq. The good thing is that on the core issues there is unanimity of view, as far as India and America are concerned, whether it is freedom or liberty or democracy, there is no disparity in that.
But yes, in small, nuanced areas, some percentage of not having a common view, that is possible. 
By 2030 there will be 5 billion people on the planet who have access to the Internet. Now that begs the question, where will these 5 billion people come from? If they are going to come from India and China and Africa, I think a larger question is also important: 
The Internet, the governance structures of the space, should the stakeholdership be equitably distributed or do we still go by the post-Second World War view of the world? 
The Internet should also break the barriers of the 1950s. 
People from Africa, Asia and China are going to be using the Internet, their aspirations, their expectations and their viewpoints also have to be kept in mind. 
Q.
So we might see in the future a mix between the American ideas and rules about the Internet and what India might contribute and what China might contribute and what African countries might contribute? 
A.
I think that is the way forward. Like I said, the numbers are there. We are now the third-largest Internet user in the world. It is going to grow exponentially, and we need to create an ecosystem where it is a positive environment.

HEADLINE: The Meaning of Mercury

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Something very good just happened. 

 BODY:
David Roberts reports on the EPA's decision, finally, to regulate mercury from coal plants:
Anyone who pays attention to green news will have spent the last two years hearing a torrent of stories about EPA rules and the political fights over them. It can get tedious. After a certain point even my eyes glaze over, and I'm paid to follow this stuff.
But this one is a Big Deal. It's worth lifting our heads out of the news cycle and taking a moment to appreciate that history is being made. Finally controlling mercury and toxics will be an advance on par with getting lead out of gasoline. It will save save tens of thousands of lives every year and prevent birth defects, learning disabilities, and respiratory diseases. It will make America a more decent, just, and humane place to live.
Let me repeat part of that: . This is actually a much bigger issue, when it comes to saving American lives, than terrorism.
As Roberts explains, we've known about these costs of mercury pollution for decades, yet it took until now to get something done. The reason is, of course, obvious: special interests, hiding behind claims of immense economic damage if anything was done, were able to block action.
It's worth noting that these claims of economic harm from pollution regulation have always been proved wrong when the regulation finally came. Ozone regulation was supposed to cripple the economy; so was acid rain regulation; neither did.
Oh, and if we're going to have to scrap some power plants and replace them, it's hard to think of a better time to do it than now, when the workers and resources needed to do the replacing would largely have been unemployed otherwise.
The point that strikes me most, however, is that this shows that it matters who holds the White House. You can complain about Obama's lack of a strong progressive agenda, which I sometimes do, or wonder what good it is to hold the White House when the other side blocks every attempt to do good through legislation. But mercury regulation would not have happened if John McCain were president.
Elections have consequences, and this is one delayed consequence of 2008 that will make a big difference.

BYLINE: NOAM COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: For one editor, life after Vogue; Deadspin on the abuse accusations against Philly sportswriter; will socially conscious hip-hop make a comeback? 

 BODY:
It's been a busy year for Carine Roitfeld, who was replaced last December as the powerful editor of French Vogue by a former friend, Emmanuelle Alt. There have been wild parties she has hosted, fashion magazines and ads she has collaborated on, and talk of starting a new magazine. Ms. Roitfeld, Eric Wilson writes, "has taken every opportunity to demonstrate the value of her brand, post-Vogue," and concludes: "Rarely has the stock price of a fashion figure shown such resilience, after taking a severe blow to the side, since Lady Duff-Gordon survived the sinking of the Titanic."
The that Bill Conlin, a prominent sportswriter, had been accused of molesting four children during the 1970s, continued to reverberate, reaching Cooperstown, N.Y. Mr. Conlin, who retired from The Philadelphia Daily News after the report, was honored this year by the Baseball Writers Association of America, which also votes on Hall of Fame entrants, and he is currently featured in an exhibit there. Questions about whether the accusations should change Mr. Conlin's status there appeared to catch the association off guard, Andrew Keh writes.

        
The sports blog Deadspin published e-mails it said were between its editor, A.J. Daulerio, and Mr. Conlin the day before The Inquirer's news broke. They offer a real-time look at Deadspin trying to encourage him to respond to the accusations at the Web site, and Mr. Conlin's grappling with the imminent news and, at times, offering suicidal comments.
One of the lead researchers of the study of bird-flu transmission that has concerned a United States government panel for what it could teach bioterrorists gave an interview about those concerns to Doreen Carvajal. The researcher, Ron A. M. Fouchier, said the government has advised sharing the material "in restricted form" (and withholding some of the research from journal articles set to be published). But Mr. Fouchier questioned how practical that would be: "This is very important research. It raises a number of important issues that need to be shared with the scientific community. And because we cannot keep this confidential with such a large group. I think the only solution is to publish in detail."
Socially conscious hip-hop is making a bit of a comeback, Jon Caramanica writes, but not for the reasons you would think, like the current economic and political tumult: "Current economic realities have made almost no mark on hip-hop this year. Preaching, which would have been a perfectly acceptable mode in the 1990s, would likely be all but ignored in today's hip-hop." Rather, he focuses on Kendrick Lamar, a young rapper from Compton, Calif., who is less direct in his message, while still "putting his ample charisma in the service of greater ideas."

HEADLINE: House Republican Floats 3-Month Payroll Tax Extension

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: A House Republican charged with trying to help resolve the payroll tax holiday mess suggested that Republicans might accept a three-month, rather than two-month, extension of the tax cut and unemployment benefits. 

 BODY:
10:29 a.m. | Updated A House Republican charged with trying to help resolve the payroll tax holiday mess suggested Thursday that Republicans might accept a three-month, rather than two-month, extension of the tax cut and unemployment benefits.
If the Senate bill, approved last week by a wide majority of the chamber, had been written to extend the benefit "to three months and did the first quarter, we might have made sense of that," said Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, a member on the conference committee that House Speaker John A. Boehner appointed this week to negotiate an agreement.
Mr. Camp, who is also the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, spoke during an interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box" Thursday morning.
"If we can't do a year, at least do a quarter, something that matches up with what employers have to report," Mr. Camp said. "We're hearing from employers that not matching up with the quarterly reporting that they're required to do with the government is going to cause them a tremendous burden and difficulty - that it makes it harder to meet payroll." 
The two parties have been locked in a standoff over extending a payroll tax holiday for 160 million workers, continuing unemployment benefits for millions more and maintaining Medicare reimbursement fees for doctors, which expire at the end of the year.
A yearlong extension was sought by both sides earlier this month, but they could not agree to the terms. Republicans sought expansive changes to the unemployment insurance program and other unrelated policy measures, which Democrats rejected.
They also disagreed over how to pay for the extensions; Democrats tried to gain support for a surcharge on earnings over $1 million, which went nowhere.
In order to give both sides time to bridge the gap without having benefits that affect almost every American household expire, the Senate voted 89 to 10 Saturday for a two-month extension, which House Republicans rejected this week, arguing that it offered too much uncertainty.
Mr. Boehner then demanded a conference committee - a process used to bridge the gap between chambers that has gone out of fashion in recent years - something Senate Democrats and the White House have rejected.
In a news conference later Thursday morning, flanked by his committee appointees, Mr. Boehner reiterated his position that a one-year bill is all the House would accept, and repeated his pleas for Senate negotiators. "It's time for us to sit down and have a serious negotiation," he said.
Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, suggested that President Obama ought to come to Capitol Hill himself to help end the impasse, rather than go Christmas shopping, as the president did Wednesday, with his dog in tow. "He can bring his dog up here, " Mr. Cantor said. "We are pet friendly."
Although the policy differences in the House and Senate bills were vast, Mr. Cantor said that any differences could be worked out "in about an hour."
The lawmakers repeatedly mentioned the one-year bill already passed by the House. And Mr. Boehner was asked repeatedly by reporters about the barrage of criticism, much of it from his own party, about the House strategy. He said he was impervious. "If you do the right thing for the right reason the right things will happen," he said.
"Look, we're not doing this for the politics," said Representative Greg Walden of Oregon.
It is possible that Republicans, to end what has become a public relations nightmare for their party, would seek to slightly amend the Senate bill in a way that would pass muster in their chamber and with the Senate. Republicans and Democrats in both the House and Senate said Thursday morning that the three-month proposal appeared to be Mr. Camp's idea, with no real affirmation from leaders in either chamber.
On CNN Thursday, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, said "Unfortunately, it takes days for us to set up a conference committee and then meet. We can't do this before Jan. 1, even if it was our intention to do it."

HEADLINE: Societe Generale's Investment Banking Chief Steps Down

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Michel Peretie, the head of Societe Generale's corporate and investment banking division, is leaving the French bank to pursue other opportunities. 

 BODY:
LONDON -- Michel Peretie, head of Societe Generale's corporate and investment banking division, is leaving the French bank to pursue other opportunities.
Mr. Peretie, who held the position for three years after joining the bank from Bear Stearns, will be succeeded by the division's chief financial officer, Didier Valet, according to a statement from Societe Generale.
Two other appointments also were announced. Christophe Mianne will become deputy chief executive of the division, while Bertrand Badre has been appointed its chief financial officer. 
The changes will take effect in January.
The announcement comes after Societe Generale said in November that its third-quarter net profit had fallen by nearly a third, weighed down by write-downs on its holding of Greek sovereign debt. The bank said profit in the three months ended Sept. 30 fell 31 percent, to 622 million euros ($856 million) from the period a year earlier.
The bank is also planning to eliminate a number of jobs in New York, as fallout from the financial crisis and a changing global regulatory environment have put pressure on its businesses there, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plans who was not authorized to speak publically.

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
Finding Success in a Lifelong Passion for Fighting Monopolies | Albert A. Foer, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, was enjoying a restful Sunday last March when news broke that AT&T was seeking to buy T-Mobile USA.
Dismayed by the possible blockbuster cellphone merger, Mr. Foer rushed to the institute's global headquarters - the first-floor study of his Washington home - and swung into action.
He complained to a reporter that "AT&T was broken up and now it's back with a vengeance." In the ensuing weeks, his organization would send a letter to the Senate, submit a lengthy objection to the Federal Communications Commission and issue a 38-page white paper arguing that the merger would "result in higher prices, lower quality, less innovation and fewer choices for consumers and businesses."
Faced with fierce opposition from the Obama administration, the two companies scrapped their $39 billion deal on Tuesday, handing Mr. Foer and his fellow antitrust-enforcement advocates a major victory.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times
President Obamahas benefited politically from the fight between House and Senate Republicans over how to work with Democrats and the White House to extend a payroll tax cut and jobless benefits, Jackie Calmes writes. But, she reports, whether the clash ultimately turns out to be a plus for Mr. Obama hinges on the economy's performance. 
On the campaign trail on Wednesday, the Republican presidential candidates dealt gingerly with the contentious back-and-forth on Capitol Hill over the payroll tax package, blaming Mr. Obama and Senate Democrats while steering clear of the intra-party feud between Congressional Republicans, Jeff Zeleny writes.
Scott Shane reports that even before Newt Gingrich launched his presidential campaign, he embraced the theory that Islamic law is a threat to the United States akin to or worse than terrorism, a view that has alarmed American Muslims, Islamic scholars and counterterrorism experts.
Hawaii has long been a stronghold for Democrats but the party's recent struggles therehave helped Republicans, one of whom could win a Senate seat long held by Democrats, Adam Nagourney writes.
Around the Web
The Wall Street Journal takes note of how Ron Paul's unusual platform has helped the Texas congressman take the lead over his rivals in Iowa.
Mr. Obama's shopping trip to northern Virginia on Wednesday showed just how confident the president is that he is beating Republicans in the tax fight, according to The Hill.
In the Senate cash race, the National Republican Senatorial Committee raised more money than its Democratic counterpart in November, but the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee kept more cash in its coffers, according to Roll Call.

Economic data scheduled to be released Thursday include third-quarter gross domestic product at 8:30 a.m. simultaneous with weekly jobless claims, followed by weekly mortgage rates and leading indicators at 10.

HEADLINE: Romney Says He Won't Release Tax Returns

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney says he does not intend to release his tax returns if he becomes the Republican presidential nominee. 

 BODY:
4:17 p.m. | Updated Mitt Romney, who is one of the wealthiest men ever to seek the presidency, said on Wednesday that he had no intention of releasing his tax returns if he became the Republican presidential nominee, breaking with a long tradition in both parties.
Mr. Romney made the statement in an interview with MSNBC on Wednesday, but the network did not show that part of the interview. Mr. Romney, a multimillionaire who made his fortune running a private equity firm, was asked whether he planned to release his tax return.
"I doubt it," Mr. Romney said, according to a transcript of the interview provided by NBC News. "I will provide all the financial info, which is an extraordinary pile of documents which show investments and so forth."
"But you won't do the tax returns?" asked Chuck Todd, host of "The Daily Rundown."
"I don't intend to release the tax returns. I don't," Mr. Romney responded. 
A spokesman for President Obama's re-election campaign blasted Mr. Romney and questioned whether he had something to hide in his finances.
"Why does Governor Romney feel like he can play by a different set of rules?" said Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for the Obama campaign. "What is it that he doesn't want the American people to see? Governor Romney, who has favored secrecy over openness time after time, should live up to the same standard of disclosure his father and others set."
The Democratic National Committee took only hours on Thursday to unveil a new Web site, www.whatmittpays.com. The site allows visitors to select their income level and compare how much less they would have paid if they were taxed at what the group assumes would be Mr. Romney's lower rate.
Presidential candidates from both parties -- including John McCain, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Al Gore and others -- have routinely released their tax returns.
Mr. Romney's personal wealth -- said to be between $190 million and $250 million -- helped to fuel his first campaign for the presidency in 2008, when he contributed more than $40 million of his own money.
A story in The New York Times this week reported that Mr. Romney continues to increase his wealth through a retirement agreement with Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded, which still pays him a share of profits long after his departure.
The arrangement with Bain also most likely means that much of Mr. Romney's income is taxed at a much lower rate than ordinary income under a provision aimed at hedge fund and private equity managers. Releasing his tax returns would allow Mr. Romney's rivals to calculate the effective tax rate he is paying.
That could be politically difficult for Mr. Romney, who often talks about the need to help middle-class Americans get through the current economic difficulties.
Throughout his political career, Mr. Romney has refused to release his personal tax returns. During his 1994 Senate campaign in Massachusetts, Mr. Romney challenged the incumbent, Edward M. Kennedy, a Democrat, to release his tax returns -- though Mr. Romney did not release his own.
Mr. Todd asked Mr. Romney about that during the interview on Wednesday.
"I never say never," Mr. Romney said, but added, "I don't intend to do so."

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Sold for $24,000,000 (But What About That $88,000,000 Deal?)

BYLINE: MARC SANTORA


HIGHLIGHT: The sale of a three-bedroom apartment for $24 million would not usually go unnoticed. But in the same week, the reported sale of a penthouse in the same building, 15 Central Park West, for a record-shattering $88 million dwarfed the first deal. 

 BODY:
In any other week, in any other city, in any other building, the sale of a three-bedroom apartment for $24 million - the most expensive transaction of the week, according to city records - would not go unnoticed.
But in the same week, in this city, the reported sale of a penthouse in the same building, 15 Central Park West, for a record-shattering $88 million, to the 22-year-old daughter of a Russian oligarch, dwarfed the first deal and made all others seem rather ho-hum.
The 6,774-square-foot apartment, which fronts on Central Park, was being sold by the financier Sanford I. Weill and his wife, Joan, who paid $43.7 million for it in 2007. 
The sale is still in contract, and the records of the transaction have not been made public, but if completed it will become the most expensive New York apartment deal ever, crushing the $53 million paid by the investor Christopher Flowers for the town house at 4 East 75th Street. 
Word recently leaked out that Mr. Weill and his broker, Kyle W. Blackmon of Brown Harris Stevens, had found a buyer willing to pay full price. This week, Forbes confirmed that the buyer was Ekaterina Rybolovleva, the daughter of a Russian billionaire, Dmitriy Rybolovlev, obtaining a statement from her representatives.
"Ms. Rybolovleva is currently studying at a U.S. university," the statement read. "She plans to stay in the apartment when visiting New York. Ms. Rybolovleva was born in Russia, is a resident of Monaco, and has resided in Monaco and Switzerland for the past 15 years."
Ms. Rybolovleva's father, whose worth is put at $9.5 billion and who is ranked by Forbes as the world's 93rd-richest person, began to build his fortune in the early 1990s, in the chaotic days after the fall of the Soviet Union. He bought interests in industrial companies, eventually controlling one of the country's largest potash fertilizer businesses. Like other oligarchs, he fell afoul of the powers that be; in 1996 he was accused in the murder of a businessman and spent nearly a year in prison. Ultimately he was acquitted for lack of evidence.
This is not Mr. Rybolovlev's first foray into mammoth real estate deals in America. In 2008 he paid nearly $100 million for Maison de L'Amitie,Donald Trump's 33,000-square-foot estate in Palm Beach, Fla.
The sale of the other apartment at 15 Central Park West, on the 31st floor, attracted little notice, though it further solidified the building's reputation as a property that can do no wrong.
George Logothetis, a shipping magnate, and his wife, Nitzia, had owned the apartment, which they bought for $12.93 million in 2008. The new owner bought it under the name of a company called Mac Holdings, according to city records.
Representatives for Mr. Weill declined to comment on his sale. But when he first put the property on the market, he said he planned to donate sale proceeds to charity. No word yet on who the recipient is, but it seems this will be a very nice holiday for at least one lucky daughter of a Russian billionaire and whatever charity gets the nod from Mr. Weill.
Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

HIGHLIGHT: Active-duty military are behind Ron Paul for one big reason. 

 BODY:
So this is Christmas, season of peace, time to reflect on the people coming home from a war that most Americans say was not worth it, and those still fighting in another war that raises new doubts by the day. 
Many of the service members returning from Iraq - where nearly 4,500 American lives were lost, 100,000 Iraqi civilians were killed and about 600,000 Christians were forced to flee the country with other refugees - are paying close attention to the campaign to decide who will be commander in chief.
What would they think of a candidate who says:
"Far from defeating the enemy, our current polices provide incentive for more people to take up arms against us."
And, "We have an empire. We can't afford it."
And, "Acting as the world's policeman and nation-building weakens our country, puts our troops in harm's way, and sends precious resources to other nations in the midst of an historic economic crisis."
The men and women in uniform probably wouldn't support this proponent of limited engagement. So goes the conventional wisdom, which holds that those in the military support a leader itching for a fight. 
But in fact, Representative Ron Paul, the congressman who favors the most minimalist American combat role of any major presidential candidate and who said all of the above quotes, has more financial support from active duty members of the service than any other politician.

As of the last reporting date, at the end of September, Paul leads all candidates by far in donations from service members. This trend has been in place since 2008, when Paul ran for president with a similar stance: calling nonsense at hawk squawk from both parties. 
This year, Paul has 10 times the individual donations - totaling $113,739 - from the military as does Mitt Romney. And he has a hundred times more than Newt Gingrich, who sat out the Vietnam War with college deferments and now promises he would strike foes at the slightest provocation. 
What seems, at first blush, counterintuitive makes more sense upon further review. There's a long tradition of military people being attracted to politicians with Paul's strict interpretation of the Constitution.
Not even a full 1 percent of Americans are active-duty military. The troops have become props for politicians who shower them with fulsome praise, while dreaming up schemes to send them into harm's way. 
Yet, these soldiers, sailors, air men and women, and assorted boots on the ground know the cost - in trauma, in lives ruined, in friends lost, in good intentions gone bad - of going to war far more than the 99 percent not currently serving. Where they put their money in a campaign, paltry though it may be in comparison to the corporate lords who control a majority of our politicians, says a great deal. 
And if the overwhelming service support for Ron Paul is any indication, the grunts of American foreign policy are gun-shy about further engagement in "useless wars," to use Dr. Paul's term.
"It's not a good sign when the people doing the fighting are saying, 'Why are we here?'" said Glen Massie, a Marine Corps veteran who lives in Des Moines, Iowa, and is supporting Paul for president. "They realize they're being utilized for other purposes - nation building and being world's policeman - and it's not what they signed up for."
With his mumbled, avuncular asides and aversion to snappy sound bites, the 76-year-old congressman from Texas is now the unlikely frontrunner in some polls in Iowa. He will not be the nominee; powerful Republicans have pledged to destroy him should he gain strength beyond the cornfields of Sioux City. His libertarian positions - on marriage, drug laws and monetary policy - are poison for too many GOP stalwarts.
He has other problems, as well. His position on health care for the elderly and working poor - basically, to let people fend for themselves, at the mercy of charity and the free enterprise system - is chilling and unrealistic. And in recent days, he's had trouble explaining some deplorable racist statements that went out under the name of his newsletter 20 years ago. (He has disavowed them.)
But, strictly considered, as the iconoclast among the toy warriors seeking to be the next president, Paul has performed an admirable service. His jabbing at Gingrich, now trying to get traction with an unconstitutional plan to arrest judges whose rulings he disagrees with, has been particularly productive. In Gingrich, we have the perfect combination of a blowhard who wants to play with real weapons, a chicken hawk and a politician who wears a rental sign to cover the empty space where principles should be. 
Gingrich and other Republicans sound eager to rush into combat with Iran, should that theocratic nightmare of a country develop a nuclear weapon. Paul shrugs at the thought. And he's consistently called the Iraq war an unnecessary disaster.
Romney claimed, in November, that President Obama's decision to bring home all American troops from Iraq was premature and represented "an astonishing failure." True to his trademark elasticity, Romney has now changed his mind and is fine with bringing the troops home. Perhaps he's been reading the polls that show that nearly two-thirds of all Americans think the Iraq war was not worth the loss of lives and treasury. 
The young people who actually fought in Iraq know better. They can tell a phony warrior from a real one. And in Ron Paul, the veteran who served as a flight surgeon for the Air Force, the man some call crazy, they hear a voice of sanity - at least in the realm of war and peace.

HEADLINE: Do We Hate the Rich or Don't We?

BYLINE: ANDREW GELMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Surveys show Americans are populist class warriors, except when they aren't. 

 BODY:
Here's an example of how the results of polls taken at the same time can be given exactly opposite interpretations.
The Danger of the New Populism
William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former adviser to President Clinton, writes in the New Republic about "Why Obama's New Populism May Sink His Campaign." 
President Obama's much-heralded speech in Osawatomie, Kan., focused on inequality, which, he argued, is undermining our prosperity, weakening our democracy, and shrinking our middle class. While there's a serious data-based argument to be made in favor of that view, recent surveys suggest that most Americans don't share it.
Galston went on to cite a Gallup survey released on Dec. 15, "Fewer Americans See U.S. Divided Into 'Haves,' 'Have Nots', which showed not only that the number of Americans who see American society as divided into haves and have-nots has decreased significantly since the 2008 election, but that the majority of Americans continue to consider themselves among the haves.
Galston also wrote about another Gallup survey, "Americans Prioritize Growing Economy Over Reducing Wealth Gap," which was released the next day. Galston pointed out that
When Gallup asked a sample of Americans in 1998 whether the gap between the rich and the poor was a problem that needed to be fixed, 52 percent said yes, while 45 percent regarded it as an acceptable part of the economic system. Today, those numbers are reversed: Only 45 percent see the gap as in need of fixing, while 52 percent don't.
Galston convincingly supports his summary with this table from Gallup.
Taking it all in, Galston concludes that "none of this is to say" that Obama is doomed to one term:
Indeed, if the economy grows a bit more quickly and unemployment falls farther than the standard forecasts predict, he may well prevail. It is to say that a campaign emphasizing growth and opportunity is more likely to yield a Democratic victory than is a campaign focused on inequality.
The Promise of the New Populism
Now, here's Matthew Yglesias, Slate's business and economics correspondent, on "A Nation of Class Warriors":
The latest Pew poll on Occupy Wall Street finds some decidedly mixed feelings out there, with Americans generally expressing much more sympathy with the concerns of the movement than with its tactics. But when Pew moved a bit away from the focus on O.W.S. and asked some more general questions about wealth and power, they revealed what more or less looks like a nation of hardened class warriors. Huge majorities of self-identified Democrats and clear majorities of self-identified independents say that there's too much power in the hands of a few rich people, that the country's economic system unfairly favors the wealthy, and that Wall Street does more to hurt the economy than to help it.
Yglesias convincingly supports his summary with this graph from the Pew data.
His conclusion? 
Under the circumstances, we should expect to see Democrats continue to double down on "tax the rich" themes and populist messages.
Putting It All Together
Let's summarize. A vast majority of Americans - including half of all self-identified Republicans - think there is "too much power in the hands of a few rich people and large corporations." And a solid majority believes that "the country's economic system unfairly favors the wealthy." On the other hand, close to 60 percent of Americans do see the country as "divided into haves and have-nots" and over 60 percent see "big government" as the biggest threat to the country in the future. What gives?
I think it's fair to say that there's enough here to support different political themes. A supporter of higher taxes for higher incomes can focus on the "too much power in the hands of the rich" angle, whereas a supporter of cuts in low-income and middle-income entitlement programs can focus on the lack of resonance of the haves and have-nots argument.
The ambiguity revealed in these polls actually makes sense: if there were a clear and unambiguous majority in favor of some policy and all its ramifications, we would expect it would have already passed and there would be no remaining political dispute. Democrats and Republicans are no longer arguing about laws against racial discrimination or child labor (with rare exceptions). The very fact that an issue is politically live suggests some flexibility on opinions and helps us understand what otherwise seems contradictory about these poll results.
What does this say about candidates' optimal political strategies? As the political scientist Lynn Vavreck has shown, presidential campaigns typically turn on the economy, and candidates adapt their messages to suit economic conditions. I agree with Galston that "a campaign emphasizing growth and opportunity" would probably be Obama's best choice - but he may not have that choice, if the economy does not seem to be doing better next year. Given the current persistent slowdown, Yglesias may well be right that Democrats will push a "tax the rich" message and attempt to frame the conversation that way.
In a way, the poll findings cited by Galston and Yglesias are not that contradictory. They give a sense of how the debate might go, with liberals focusing on the power of the rich and big business, and conservatives reminding voters that taxes taken from the rich will go straight to the federal government.
Suppose for a moment that the responses captured in these polls went in the opposite direction, with a majority having a positive feeling about the government and an increasing concern about inequality, but with most Americans thinking the rich have too much power. In that case, one might expect a very different sort of debate. 
As the political scientists Lawrence Jacobs and Robert Shapiro have demonstrated, politicians don't just see public opinion as a constraint; they also use it as a tool to achieve their policy goals. Conflicting majority attitudes - for example, a belief that the economic system unfairly favors the wealthy, juxtaposed with a relative lack of concern for income inequality - represent an opportunity for smart politicians to reshape public opinion their way.

HEADLINE: No One Is Above the Law

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: To protect democracy, the biggest banks must be broken up, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The American ideal of equal and impartial justice under law has repeatedly been undermined by attempts to concentrate power. Our political system has many advantages, but it also provides motive and opportunity for resourceful people to become so strong they can elude the legal constraints that bind others.
The most obvious example is the oil and railroad trusts at the end of the 19th century. A version of the same process is happening again today, but what has become concentrated is not a vital energy source or the nation's transport arteries but rather something much more abstract - financial sector risk.
In early 2009, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner reportedly said to President Obama and senior members of the new administration, with regard to the financial system (as described by Ron Suskind on Page 202 of "Confidence Men)":
The confidence in the system is so fragile still. The trust is gone. One poor earnings report, a disclosure of a fraud, or a loss of faith in the dealings between one large bank and another -- a withdrawal of funds or refusal to clear trades -- and it could result in a run, just like Lehman.

Three years later, the megabanks are even bigger, as is the risk they concentrate (see my recent testimony to the financial institutions subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee for details). Curiously, their precariousness, as much as their power, is shielding these behemoths from the enforcement of financial fraud laws.
Thankfully, this lawlessness - and it is that - nettles some regulators and prosecutors. The New York State attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is mobilizing the resources for a long-overdue investigation of Wall Street practices that, I hope, will gather momentum.
But the Obama administration continues to dither, arguing behind the scenes that the financial system is still too weak. This inertia - a government at rest tends to stay at rest - has led to public protest and deeply shaken trust in the financial system.
In an important article in The Huffington Post this week, Jeff Connaughton (former chief of staff to Senator Ted Kaufman, Democrat of Delaware) asserts that the Department of Justice failed to concentrate the resources that might have built successful cases:
As The New York Times and New Yorker have reported, the department's leadership never organized or supported strike-force teams of bank regulators, F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors for each of the potential primary defendants and ignored past lessons about how to crack financial fraud.
We may never know exactly why the administration failed to organize effectively along these lines, but Mr. Geithner's influence is likely to have played a role. For his part, President Obama, the few times he was asked, explained that past unethical Wall Street actions were "not illegal."
Mr. Geithner may dispute details in "Confidence Men" (which was also quoted by Mr. Connaughton in his piece), but worry about system stability is part of the Treasury secretary's job. Despite a lack of any supporting evidence, Mr. Geithner sees megabanks as essential to the functioning of the economy - and he gambled on bailing them out as a way to restart the economy.
So it would have been entirely logical for him to fear disclosures that would damage their business models and legal viability.
Whenever someone or a group of people is above the law, equality before the law is ended. This is how the megabanks, and the way they are treated, threaten to undermine democracy.
For your holiday reading, pick an example of power and accomplishment gone awry in American history. I suggest the bizarre tale in the new book "American Emperor: Aaron Burr's Challenge to Jefferson's America," by David Stewart, or the classic account of the confrontation between President Andrew Jackson and the Second Bank of the United States in "The Age of Jackson," by Arthur Schlesinger; or Teddy Roosevelt's confrontation with the railroad trusts, described in Edmund Morris's "Theodore Rex."
Or, if you prefer something more modern, try Richard Reeves's ultimately sad "President Nixon: Alone in the White House."
The lesson of these books is that throughout American history, the ultimate constraint is not so much the courtroom but the polling place. And here the classic American feedback mechanism appears to be damaged.
President Obama's campaigns have taken a great deal of money from Wall Street and, as Mr. Suskind's book vividly illustrates, have proved consistently reluctant to take on this powerful vested interest. This is why Mr. Geithner is still Treasury secretary.
In "The Rise and Decline of Nations: Economic Growth, Stagflation, and Social Rigidities," Mancur Olson identified the rise of special interests as a problem for all societies - a form of sclerosis sets in. This is a perfect idea for those on the political right; they can cite Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom," no less, on the idea that powerful people seize the state and its ideology to insulate themselves from competition.
Unfortunately, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich - the current front-runners for the Republican nomination - are also presumed to have taken or to be seeking a great deal of money from Wall Street. (See this coverage of President Obama and Mr. Romney, and of Mr. Gingrich.)
Ron Paulhas expressed concern about big banks. But his only policy recommendation is not to bail them out in the future - that is, just let them fail.
Unfortunately, this philosophy fails to appreciate the true nature of the big banks' power and the damage they can cause.
Too-big-to-fail banks benefit from an unfair, nontransparent and dangerous subsidy scheme. This isn't a market mechanism; it's a government-backed distortion of historic proportions. And it should be eliminated.
Jon Huntsman, the only candidate with a credible plan to break up big banks, is currently polling 13 percent in New Hampshire (although Nate Silver sees hope).
Presidential elections matter, because the winner appoints those who protect - or promise to protect - the public interest. As Mr. Connaughton reminds us:
Repeat financial fraudsters don't pay relatively paltry -- and therefore painless -- penalties because of statutory caps on such penalties. Rather, regulatory officials, appointed by Obama, negotiated these comparatively trifling fines.
We could replace these officials with people who are less sympathetic to the banks. But this sympathy comes from fear - the fear of what could happen if a big bank fails. New officials would soon share the old fears.
Our biggest banks pose a real threat; if you hold them accountable for their past actions, they will collapse. The only credible way to counter to this threat - and the only reasonable way to protect our democracy - is to break them up.

HEADLINE: Artists Equipped With a Social Conscience

BYLINE: By KAREN ROSENBERG

 BODY:
One of many artistic casualties of the McCarthy-era blacklists was the Photo League, a New York school and salon for amateur and professional photographers. Progressive in its politics and uncompromising in its aesthetics, the league was the place to be if you had a hand-held 35-millimeter camera and a left-leaning social conscience -- and particularly if you believed, to borrow a bit of contemporary parlance, that photography was fine art for the 99 percent.
Its members -- among them Berenice Abbott, Aaron Siskind and Weegee -- are now reunited in ''The Radical Camera: New York's Photo League 1936-1951'' at the Jewish Museum. This stirring show traces the group's history through some 145 vintage photographs.
A collaboration between the Jewish Museum and the Columbus Museum of Art, which both have extensive holdings of Photo League work, ''Radical Camera'' was organized by the team of Mason Klein (from the Jewish Museum) and Catherine Evans (from the Columbus Museum). 
The exhibition is, in some ways, as unwieldy as its subject. The curators have a lot to say about documentary photography in general, which went through a kind of growth spurt between the Depression and the Cold War, nurtured by an explosion of photojournalism in magazines like Life and Look.
They deserve a lot of credit, though, for capturing the breadth and spirit of the league. There are some big names in ''Radical Camera,'' but the show's best moments involve lesser-known talents like Lucy Ashjian, Jerome Liebling and Sid Grossman.
The Photo League had roots in the workers' movement, though by the 1950s it was hardly the political center the blacklist made it out to be. The league evolved from an organization called Workers International Relief, founded in 1930, which produced an illustrated journal that was modeled on European Communist weeklies like The Worker's Illustrated Newspaper.
By 1933 this coterie had started to focus on moviemaking and rechristened itself the Workers Film and Photo League, turning out Depression-era newsreels like the one excerpted at the beginning of ''Radical Camera.''
Titled ''Workers Newsreel Unemployment Special,'' the film shows protesters gathering in Union Square to demand government assistance for the jobless. These timely visuals are accompanied by even timelier text: ''In the richest country in the world, two billion dollars of relief for the bankers and industrialists ... but no help for the unemployed.''
In 1936, the group's photographers split off from its filmmakers, and the Photo League was born. But the social-documentary impulse of the group's earlier incarnations remained; many early Photo League members modeled themselves on Lewis Hine and Paul Strand, represented in the show by Strand's famous ''Wall Street'' (1915) and Hine's heartstring-tugging shot of a Washington newsboy (1912).
Some, like Arthur Rothstein and Sid Grossman, traveled to the Dust Bowl to photograph its ravaged farming communities. But many others found plentiful subject matter close to home: in Lower East Side tenements, along the Third Avenue El and on Coney Island.
They brought empathy, but also humor, to their urban vignettes. In a shot by Eliot Elisofon, children scamper around an empty lot behind a sign that reads ''WPA Cleaned This Area ... Keep it Clean.'' And in Morris Engel's ''Women on the Beach, Coney Island,'' an ill-fitting bathing suit is front and center.
Sometimes they fell prey to stereotypes, as in the four-year group project ''Harlem Document'' (1936-40), spearheaded by Mr. Siskind and published in Look.'' It provided ample, but often superficial, evidence of poverty and dangerous living conditions -- for example in Jack Manning's shot of fire escapes teeming with residents during an Elks Parade. Mr. Siskind later acknowledged: ''Our study was definitely distorted. We didn't give a complete picture of Harlem.''
Other Photo League efforts, though, reveal a deep connection to a neighborhood. In Walter Rosenblum's look at life along Pitt Street on the Lower East Side (his own childhood haunt), you can tell that he identifies with the youngsters in his frame: the girl on a swing set under the Williamsburg Bridge, or the boys making chalk drawings in the shadows of tenements.
Rosenblum later went to work as a combat photographer, and the show includes one of his shots from Omaha Beach on D-Day. Back in New York, many of the League's women found new opportunities -- albeit temporary ones -- during the war. A 1945 image by Ida Wyman, who became the first female photo printer at Acme Newspictures, shows the front of an Italian restaurant near her office; a sign reads ''Ladies Invited.''
By this point the league was a fully functioning school and exhibition space. It was also a social organization, a place where young men and women (many of them first-generation Jewish-Americans) could mingle at lectures and parties. It held popular ''photo hunts,'' sending members all over the city on wacky assignments, and fund-raisers called ''Crazy Camera Balls.'' (A cheerful flier for one of these reads, ''Come dressed as your favorite photograph!'')
Just a few years later, though -- on Dec. 5, 1947, to be precise -- the league appeared on a list of organizations considered ''totalitarian, fascist, communist or subversive'' by the United States Attorney General. It responded with an open letter and a 1948 retrospective exhibition, ''This is the Photo League.'' But it was dealt a fatal blow during a 1949 trial of alleged Communist Party officials, when a league member turned F.B.I. informant called the Photo League a Communist front and singled out its leading teacher, Sid Grossman, as a party recruiter.
Membership became too dangerous. Newspapers and magazines snubbed league-affiliated photographers; photojournalists couldn't get passports. In 1951, the Photo League closed its doors.
Mr. Grossman fled to Provincetown, Mass. The photographs he made there, nearly abstract overhead shots of birds on water, make a rather depressing coda to ''Radical Camera.'' But the show's overall message is an uplifting one, epitomized by Mr. Grossman's earlier photograph ''Coney Island'' (1947): a boisterous, gang's-all-here group portrait.

HEADLINE: Black Women Are Joining the American Military at a Disproportionate Rate

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
Black women are enlisting in the military at far higher rates than are white or Hispanic women, and they now represent nearly a third of all the women in the armed forces, a new study by the Pew Research Center has found. 
The study found that of the 167,000 enlisted women in the military, 31 percent are black, twice their percentage in the civilian female population. Black men represent about 16 percent of the male enlisted population, roughly equal to their proportion in the civilian population.
White women, by comparison, represent 53 percent of women in the military, while accounting for 78 percent of the civilian female population.
The study, which is based on demographic data collected by the Defense Department, confirmed what military experts have known for years: that black women are a crucial source of new recruits for the armed forces, especially for the Army and the Air Force.
Why black women enlist at higher rates than white women or black men has not been extensively studied, said Beth J. Asch, a senior economist and defense manpower specialist at the Rand Corporation. But she suggested that the military tries to attract high school graduates who are looking for job training, good benefits and help with college tuition -- and that a high percentage of black women fit that bill.
''That is the group the military targets,'' Ms. Asch said.
There were more than 200,000 female enlisted and commissioned officers in the military in 2010, up from about 55,000 in 1973. Women now represent 14 percent of the enlisted ranks and 16 percent of commissioned officers.
The study, which also drew on surveys conducted by the Pew Center this year with 1,873 veterans, showed that women in the military differ from their male counterparts in several ways.
Military women, for instance, are less likely than military men to be married, 46 percent to 58 percent. But while nearly half of the married women in the military have spouses who are also in the military, just 7 percent of married military men have wives in the forces.
The study also found that women were far more likely than men to serve in the Air Force, but far less likely to join the Marine Corps. That probably reflects the central role of the infantry in the Marines, since women are barred from ground combat units.
Though nearly a third of the women in the military are in administrative jobs, the study found that many more were being assigned to combat areas than in the past: 24 percent of women who served since 1990 spent time in combat zones, compared with 7 percent before 1990.
It also found that even though women were less likely than men to have served in a combat zone, they were almost as likely to report having had traumatic experiences or difficulties readjusting to civilian life.
Women in the military were also more critical of the recent wars than their male peers, the survey showed: 63 percent of women said the Iraq war was not worth fighting, compared with 47 percent of men; 54 percent of women said the same about Afghanistan, compared with 39 percent of men.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Drop, but 3rd-Quarter Growth Is Revised Down

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- New claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week to the lowest level in more than three and a half years, suggesting that the labor market recovery was gaining speed.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 364,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That was the lowest number since April 2008.
In other economic news, a survey released on Thursday showed that consumer sentiment rose in December to its highest level in six months. And a gauge of future economic activity increased more than expected in November because of a sharp pickup in new permits to build homes. 
But revised data showed that the nation's economic growth was slower than previously estimated in the third quarter because of a sharp drop in health care spending. Stronger business investment and a fall in inventories pointed to a pickup in output in the current period.
The United States economy has shown signs it is gaining steam as the year ends, although the recovery still could be derailed by any big flare-up in Europe's debt crisis.
JOBLESS CLAIMS The decline in jobless claims last week was a more positive development than expected. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 375,000 last week.
The previous week's jobless claims data was revised up to 368,000 from the previously reported 366,000.
The level of unemployment claims has fallen in recent weeks, and analysts say fewer layoffs means employers are probably more likely to hire.
Economists at Goldman Sachs said earlier in the week that weekly claims below 435,000 pointed to net monthly gains in jobs. Their research was based on figures available through October.
In November, the jobless rate dropped to a two-and-a-half-year low of 8.6 percent. The Federal Reserve last week acknowledged an improvement in the jobs market, but said unemployment remained high and left the door open for further measures to help the economy.
ECONOMIC OUTPUT In a report released on Thursday, the Commerce Department said in its final estimate that gross domestic product grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, down from the previously estimated 2 percent.
Economists had expected growth to be unrevised at 2 percent. Though spending on health care dropped by $2.2 billion, spending on durable goods was stronger than previously estimated, indicating that the household appetite to consume remained healthy.
A previous report said that health care spending increased at a $19.7 billion rate. Health care spending subtracted about 0.1 of a percentage point from the G.D.P. change in the final revision, whereas in the previous estimate, it added 0.61 of a percentage point to growth.
Despite the downward revision, the third-quarter growth is still a step up from the April-June period's 1.3 percent pace. Part of the pickup in output during the last quarter reflected a reversal of factors that held back growth earlier in the year.
A jump in gasoline prices weighed on consumer spending earlier in the year, and supply disruptions from Japan's big earthquake and tsunami in March curbed auto production.
The government revised consumer spending to a 1.7 percent growth rate from 2.3 percent because of adjustments to health care services, in particular nonprofit hospitals.
Spending on durable goods was, however, revised up to a 5.7 percent pace from 5.5 percent.
Business inventories dropped by $2 billion, which sliced 1.35 percentage points from G.D.P. growth. Inventories previously were estimated to have declined $8.5 billion.
The drag from inventories was offset by strong business spending, which increased at a 15.7 percent rate, instead of 14.8 percent.
CONSUMER SENTIMENT In a fresh sign of economic hope, a survey released Thursday showed that Thomson Reuters University of Michigan's final reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment rose to 69.9 points in December from 64.1 the previous month.
It topped the median forecast of 68 points among economists polled by Reuters and beat December's preliminary figure of 67.7.
Over all, real spending is expected to increase by 1.8 percent in 2012 as long as action is taken on extending the payroll tax cut, the survey said.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions rose to 79.6 points from 77.6, while the survey's gauge of consumer expectations gained to 63.6 points, from 55.4. All three indexes were at their highest level since June.
''I think it's a reflection of improving job statistics, we're seeing an increase in retail sales and even housing seems to be going up,'' said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. ''A lot of the key bookends of our economy appear to be really strengthening and that's supporting confidence.''
LEADING INDICATORS A report released Thursday by the Conference Board suggested that economic momentum could increase by spring.
The private firm's Leading Economic Index rose 0.5 percent in November to 118 points, following a 0.9 percent increase in October. It was the seventh consecutive monthly gain in the index.
''The risk of an economic downturn in the near term has receded,'' said Ataman Ozyildirim, an economist at the Conference Board.
Ken Goldstein, another Conference Board economist, said the index suggested the economy could pick up steam by spring.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the index to rise 0.3 percent in November.

HEADLINE: Mandatory Office Party and 'Night of Dirty Songs'

BYLINE: By RACHEL LEE HARRIS

 BODY:
The average holiday office party can be divided into two parts: awkward conversation with co-workers before the booze kicks in, and even more awkward conversation with co-workers after it does. That's why the Miser tends to bow out early and head to parties where letting loose is less likely to damage professional reputations. 
The Mandatory Office Party at Union Hall on Friday should be the perfect alternative, with comedians standing in for your boss and drinks cheap enough for the overworked and underpaid. A glass of Creagnog ($7) is a special holiday treat named after Caroline Creaghead, the evening's host.
As the producer of a handful of live comedy shows around town, Ms. Creaghead is more familiar with the business of funny than with regular office life. ''I graduated from college right into the recession,'' she said, ''and while I was lucky enough to land internships at places like 'The Colbert Report' and The Onion, I found out paid jobs were much harder to come by.'' So she started her own production outfit, Creaghead & Company, and dedicated herself to the pursuit of developing shows that feature the smartest and most entertaining people in New York, she said.
Friday's Office Party brings together some of Ms. Creaghead's favorites, like Tom Shillue, a former ''Daily Show'' correspondent and a frequent storyteller at the Moth and Joe's Pub; Brooke Van Poppelen, a commentator on ''The Greatest'' series on VH1; and an unnamed special guest whom she confirmed was ''hairy and has a melodic voice.''
''I think that for people who don't mind the hustle, going it alone is actually the most secure thing you can do right now,'' Ms. Creaghead said. ''If I'm going to invest all of my time and energy into something, I want the payoff to be mine to keep.''
(Friday, doors open at 8 p.m.; 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn; 718-638-4400, unionhallny.com; $8.)
NAUGHTY BUT NICE
On Saturday Jessica Delfino sings an irreverent tribute to the season in ''A Night of Dirty Songs'' at Joe's Pub. Ms. Delfino's off-kilter holiday tunes and sexy folk music will be accompanied by additional sensational music sung by comedians who have performed on Comedy Central, ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' and ''Late Show With David Letterman.''

HEADLINE: Heyday for Bargain Hunters

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Half off at the entire store at Ann Taylor. Sixty percent at Gap. Forty percent off almost everything at Abercrombie & Fitch.
Aggressive last-minute deals in the days before Christmas are good for procrastinators, but they could be an alarm bell for the retail industry.
While scattered markdowns are standard every year, discounts across entire stores -- which analysts say are more widespread than last year -- suggest merchants are stuck with too much merchandise. 
''It's really a game of chicken,'' said David Bassuk, managing director and head of the retail practice at the consultant firm AlixPartners.
Many retailers entered the season ''with pretty optimistic plans'' that shoppers would rush into stores and pay full price, Mr. Bassuk said. But that did not pan out, and the final days before Christmas have retailers being ''much more aggressive in terms of promotions being offered,'' he said.
Shoppers are filling their holiday lists against the backdrop of an uncertain year, with stubbornly high unemployment, increased food prices, volatile gas prices and unpredictability for stocks and Europe's debt crisis. The government on Thursday said that third-quarter economic growth had not been as brisk as it previously estimated, because of a drop in consumer spending on services like health care.
Toys ''R'' Us announced on Thursday new deals on dozens of items for Friday and Saturday, including 'buy one, get one half off'' on popular toys like Legos. A sampling of other promotions: Up to 70 percent off toys at Amazon; up to 50 percent off gifts at Restoration Hardware; 40 percent off almost everything at American Eagle Outfitters, Talbots, Limited and Wet Seal; and 30 percent off everything at J. Crew.
''There's been kind of a waiting game with retailers,'' Gerald L. Storch, the chief executive of Toys ''R'' Us, told CNBC last week. ''And it looks like the consumer wins.''
Paul Lejuez, an analyst at Nomura Equity Research, surveyed mall deals over the weekend and said he was concerned. ''It looks like 40 percent is the new level you have to be at, 40 percent off, to drive traffic. Those that weren't at that level weren't getting their fair share,'' he said.
Going into the holiday season, inventories had grown more than three times as fast as sales at several retailers, including American Eagle Outfitters, Aeropostale, Gap Inc., Urban Outfitters, Chico's and Talbots. ''If inventory is growing ahead of sales growth, there is a need to be more promotional to move the goods,'' Mr. Lejuez said.
Although sales over Thanksgiving weekend were surprisingly strong, Mr. Lejuez said they seemed to have cut into shopping that more typically would occur in December. Sales were sluggish the first two weeks after Thanksgiving, though they improved in the third week, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers.
In e-mail inboxes, the promotional cadence is rapid. Retailers sent about 5.6 e-mails each last week on average, according to the e-mail marketer Responsys. That was a 26 percent increase over the same week last year, and matched the record high hit during the week of Cyber Monday this year.
Stores including Macy's and Toys ''R'' Us are offering 24-hour shopping in the days before Christmas, and many stores moved ''Super Saturday,'' a promotion that falls on the final Saturday before Christmas, back a week hoping to spur sales.
The deals are a boon for people who have put off shopping.
''Last-minute Christmas shopping,'' posted a Twitter user named Samra Tekeste. ''Literally everything is on sale, LOL. Knew my procrastination would come in handy some day.'' Another Twitter user with the handle BossNugget suggested that the King of Prussia mall near Philadelphia hang up a sign saying ''It's Almost Christmas, and Everything Is on Sale.''
The big discounts mean that retailers are willing to sacrifice profits for revenue.
''More and more each year, sales become less of the issue, and it's more about what retailers have to do to get those,'' Mr. Lejuez said. ''There's a little more pressure on that out-the-door price than we would have thought, and, I think, what the market would have anticipated.''
And, after Christmas, the value of most merchandise slides.
''The inventory is worth so much less in two weeks,'' said the chief executive of a retailer, who asked not to be named because he did not want to reveal his store's strategy. ''With that kind of inventory, you've got to get rid of it. Whatever the margin is today, it's that much lower next week and the week after when traffic stops.''

HEADLINE: Blindsided by Financial Crisis, and Trying to Rebuild

BYLINE: By MATHEW R. WARREN

 BODY:
To Tahesha Calder, her bond with her young son was slipping away. It seemed as if whenever she had a chance to see him, he was asleep.
''I would bring him to the day care sleeping and pick him up at my mother's house sleeping,'' Ms. Calder said. ''It used to bother me so much.''
It was three years ago, and Ms. Calder and her son, Orion Bakare, were living in an apartment in the Williamsbridge section of the Bronx. She was employed as a caseworker for mentally ill and homeless patients at the Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn. Though the work was satisfying, she said, the long commute from her apartment meant she had little time to spend with Orion, now 4.
Struggling to balance motherhood and work, Ms. Calder decided to make a change. Confident she would be able to find similar work closer to home, she left her job of four years in 2008. She was blindsided when the bottom fell out of the economy. 
Ms. Calder, 31, said that the downturn had caused many programs in her field to lose financing, and that jobs became impossible to get. Her savings quickly dried up. She had been raising Orion with only minimal support from his father, she said, and could no longer afford her son's day care or the rent for their one-bedroom apartment. She moved in with her mother, nearby.
''You're living on your own and you move back into your mother's -- it was a drastic change,'' Ms. Calder said.
For a year, she and Orion made do, until the crowded conditions in the three-bedroom apartment -- her younger brother and younger sister also lived there -- put a strain on her relationship with her mother.
''I have a great relationship with my mother from a distance, but we can't be in the same house,'' Ms. Calder said. ''My son needs his own space. I need my own space.''
With no other options, Ms. Calder said, she and Orion entered New York City's shelter system. She recalled that at the Prevention Assistance and Temporary Housing Intake Center in the Bronx, where she awaited placement, she saw a woman wailing as workers from the city's Administration for Children Services took away her children. Ms. Calder said the experience terrified her.
She and her son were sent to a shelter in Manhattan that was teeming with rats, which stole their food, Ms. Calder said. But after three weeks, she said, the Department of Homeless Services determined they were ineligible to remain in the shelter and suggested they live with Ms. Calder's mother. Not wanting to return to her mother's apartment, Ms. Calder found her way to an abandoned building in the Bronx, where she and Orion lived as squatters for a few days. That was a low point, she said.
Another occurred when she returned to her mother's home to pick up some of Orion's things and she, her mother and her younger sister had a terrible fight, Ms. Calder said.
Ms. Calder received an order of protection against her mother and sister and was allowed to re-enter the city's shelter system. She and Orion were placed at Concourse House in the Bronx, where they have now lived for over a year.
''When I came here, I started to cry,'' Ms. Calder said. ''It was like I was in the Taj Mahal compared to where I was before. Then Orion said, 'Mommy, is this our home now?' That almost killed me.''
Orion, standing recently between the twin beds that take up most of the room he shares with his mother in the shelter, has one wish: ''I want to move into a pretty house.''
She has her mind set on getting them out, improving her resume and completing the training to obtain certification in alcoholism and substance-abuse counseling. She also pursued an internship as a counselor, but could not afford the clothing required. Her only monthly income is $264 a month in public assistance and $279 in food stamps.
In May, she turned to the City Bar Justice Center's Legal Clinic for the Homeless, an affiliate of the Children's Aid Society, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and received $200 from the fund to buy clothes.
Ms. Calder has renewed her job search. She said she sent out more than 30 resumes in the past few months.
''The economy is hard,'' she said. ''I need to do more networking. I know I'm capable of doing the job. I know I can convince a person to stop using; I'm pretty persuasive.''
Ms. Calder and her mother have reconciled, and Orion is attending preschool. His teachers have told Ms. Calder he is academically advanced, she said.
''I'm pretty proud of him,'' she said.
She prays that their hard work will pay off.
''When your kid wants something and you can't get it for them,'' she said, ''that is the most heartbreaking thing in the world.''

HEADLINE: Michigan City Turns Down Millions of Dollars, Saying Federal Money Is Not Free

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Cats lie down with dogs.
Water flows uphill.
A city turns down $8.5 million in federal grant money.
In what could be a new high water mark of anti-Washington sentiment, the city of Troy, Mich., is rejecting a long-planned transportation center whose construction would have been fully financed with federal stimulus money.
The terminal, which would help Troy become a transportation node on an upgraded Detroit-to-Chicago Amtrak line, was hailed by supporters as a way to create jobs and to spur economic development. But federal money is federal money, so with the urging of the new mayor, who helped found the local Tea Party chapter, the City Council cast a 4-to-3 vote this week against granting a crucial contract, sending the project into limbo. 
''There's nothing free about government money,'' Mayor Janice Daniels said in an interview. ''It's never free, and it's crippling our way of life.''
Other Republican officeholders have said ''Thanks, but no thanks'' to federal money for high-speed rail: Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin rejected an $810 million federal grant to extend passenger rail from Milwaukee to Madison; Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey killed a project to dig a new commuter rail tunnel under the Hudson River. But those actions have generally involved criticism of the underlying logic of the projects, or projections of enormous costs to be borne down the line by state and local governments.
The Troy transit center's construction, by comparison, required no local contribution, and its predicted annual maintenance cost of $31,000 was, in the context of the city's $50 million budget, ''de minimis,'' said Mark Miller, the assistant city manager.
The federal government's largess is no reason to build the transit center when the national debt stands at $15 trillion, Mayor Daniels said.
Yet if the money does not go to Troy, it will not be used to pay down the national debt; it will be redirected to other projects around the country.
Taking Tea Party reasoning to the local level has outraged supporters of the transit center, which has been in the works for a decade. Michele Hodges, the president of the Troy Chamber of Commerce, which supports the transit project, said that her organization ''will be a pit bull for what's best for this community.''
David A. Kotwicki, a local lawyer, noted that members of Congress might talk tough on spending, but that they still bring projects home to their districts. The vote against the transit center, he said, looks like ''cutting off your nose to spite your face.''
Besides, he asked, ''What if there's a grant to provide 10 new police officers?''
Michigan's governor, Rick Snyder, a Republican, said through a spokeswoman that he was ''disappointed'' in the city's decision and would be ''reviewing our options for utilizing the grant, including the potential transfer of the grant to another applicant.'' Mr. Snyder had sent a letter to Mayor Daniels before the vote saying that the project would have ''significant, positive economic development on your community and the state.''
The transit fight is not Mayor Daniels's first brush with controversy. Earlier this month, it was revealed that she posted a message to her Facebook page last June, after New York State approved same-sex marriage, stating, ''I think I am going to throw away my I Love New York carrying bag now that queers can get married there.'' In an interview, she said she regretted the online comment.
The vote on Monday, she said, is about setting an example concerning the national debt. ''I want to leave a legacy for our children of managing our responsibilities -- not crushing them with debt money.''
On Tuesday, an official of Magna International, a global automotive supplier based in Canada whose American headquarters are in Troy, expressed frustration with the City Council vote in a private e-mail to Ms. Hodges and others that was posted to a blog that favors the transit center.
''I am drafting a memo to all Magna group presidents and our Magna corporate executives strongly recommending that Magna International no longer consider the City of Troy for future site considerations, expansions or new job creation,'' wrote Frank W. Ervin III, the company's manager of government affairs. ''I have also recommended that where ever and when ever possible we reduce our footprint and employment level in Troy'' in favor of communities that act in the best interests of residents and business and that do ''not simply use their public position to advance their own private agenda.''
Mr. Ervin did not respond to requests for comment, but told The Detroit News on Tuesday that the letter reflected his personal opinion and recommendation for the company, but that he had no control over the company's decision.
Ed Myles, the president of a local manufacturing company, J.E. Myles & Co., said that the area, like the rest of the country, had been hurt by the recession and that it could use the economic boost that the transit center could provide. He said he worried about what companies like Magna would do. The council's vote ''put the kibosh on any other companies moving here.''
''It's all politics,'' he said. ''In the meantime, people are suffering.''

CLARK HOWARD'S LIVING LARGE IN LEAN TIMES
250+ Ways to Buy Smarter, Spend Smarter, and Save Money
By Clark Howard With Mark Meltzer and Theo Thimou
258 pages. Avery. $18.
This time of year one's thoughts turn toward family, friends, the best rum to decant into eggnog and -- if you are like me, three years out of five -- the vertiginous mountain of debt on your credit cards, and the financial reckoning that is breathing into your nostrils, a bit like a wolf.
I'm not a reader of self-help books, unless cookbooks and old poetry anthologies count. But this time of year I often find myself lingering in the personal finance section of bookstores, hoping some painless and rain-making tip rubs off on me. Sometimes I'll buy one of these crisp-looking money books, by Suze Orman or Dave Ramsey or some other brand name, and place it by my bedside, and then read something else. 
This year the book that leapt into my uneager arms was ''Clark Howard's Living Large in Lean Times,'' a tightwad manifesto that's been lingering on the New York Times how-to best-seller list all fall. Mr. Howard is himself a brand name. He has a popular daily syndicated talk radio show, a weekly program on the HLN cable channel and is the author of several previous books. He sometimes refers to himself as ''El Cheapo Man.''
His new book is at once gloomy and upbeat, like an Arcade Fire song. He believes the American economy is a full 5 to 10 years away from rebounding. He also believes that if you devote yourself to his admonitions -- that is, to the tormenting details of ''saving more, spending less, and avoiding getting ripped off'' -- you can get a handle on your wallet and maybe even your life. Perhaps, I thought, while annotating this document of the current recession, I can see to it that my Christmas tree will not be repossessed.
Much of Mr. Howard's advice is commonsensical and timeless: check your credit card statements carefully, comparison-shop for health care, that sort of thing. Yet some of it delighted me. Who knew you could make one disposable razor blade last for a year simply by drying it well after each use? Or that Century Gothic is the most economical font to print in? The companies that charge gouging sums for razorblade and ink cartridge replacements are loathsome, and any chance to stick it to them must be aggressively seized.
One thing to know about Mr. Howard is that he will ask you to relinquish a good bit of your pride. I tend, when feeling poor, to want to live as if -- as Elizabeth Gaskell put it in her novel ''Cranford'' (1851) -- ''economy was always 'elegant,' and money-spending always 'vulgar and ostentatious.' '' To behave like a duck, that is: dignified on the surface while pedaling away madly down below.
Mr. Howard's book, however, is not about elegant thrift. It is about unhip and sometimes unhinged penny-pinching, qualities that have endeared him to his fans. ''I have always been cheap,'' he says, ''which I define as being willing to accept lower quality for a lower price.''
Thus he will have you buying an artificial Christmas tree, used clothes and off-brand electronics, and also attending a community college, at least at the start of your higher education. You will clip coupons and perhaps operate a call center out of your living room. Side effects of this book may include frowziness. He will make you pay attention as never before, however, to Benjamin Franklin's dictum that one should ''beware of little expenses; a small leak will sink a great ship.''
The only way to read a book like this one, packed as it is with gimmicks on every page, is to filter it for advice that seems plausible and might fit how you live. When I saw that Mr. Howard's very first tip was to ''search for unclaimed money in your name'' on Web sites like MissingMoney.com and Unclaimed.org, I nearly gave his book to my dogs as a chew toy. It sounded like advice for people who buy dream-interpretation books for picking lottery numbers.
When, in full reportorial mode, I entered my name into both sites, however, I was floored to get three hits, two for my late grandfather from West Virginia and one for me. These will probably turn out to be time-consuming red herrings. But I stopped scoffing at (most of) Mr. Howard's tutorial.
I focused intently on the food sections in Mr. Howard's book, because that's where a lot of my money goes. I essentially agree, ruinously, with the novelist Jim Harrison, who wrote that ''whereas five hundred bucks seems reasonable for a great meal, I would not conceive of spending that much for an article of clothing or footwear.''
Mr. Howard will have you taking a second look at grocery store house brands, which he says have improved, ending your consumption of bottled water and steering clear of organic products unless the label reads ''100% organic.'' I suspect if you told him it was possible to spend $500 on a restaurant meal a little beastie would burst from his thorax, ''Alien''-style, killing him but offering coupons for Little Caesar's pizza.
He'll have you reading novels that are in the public domain, and thus free, on your Kindle. (Weirdly, he never talks up libraries.) He likes Netflix, hates cable and satellite TV companies and recommends renting movies from those kiosks where they can be had for one dollar a night.
He loves Twitter as an outlet for consumer pique. If you ask a hotel to bring up clean towels and they put you off, he suggests, tweet about it. ''Hotel management may ring your room and offer, 'We're sorry you were unhappy with the lack of clean towels today. Can we come by now and drop some off for you?' '' These Twitter outbursts work best if a) you have plenty of followers and b) your tone is less outraged than wittily perplexed.
Two things will probably prevent me, now that I've read this book, from picking it up again. One, the writing is generic at best, the prose equivalent of truck-stop lighting. ''I nearly had a coronary'' and ''prompting my wife to blow her top'' are typical samples, from the same page.
Two, Mr. Howard makes it clear how much effort and devotion it takes to live the tightwad lifestyle; one must constantly troll dozens of Web sites for deals in every aspect of one's life. It's a full-time job. It's the sort of time only the unemployed truly have.
Still, here's a warm holiday toast to El Cheapo Man -- the bubbly is prosecco, not Champagne -- $7.95 a pop at budgetbottle.com, and actually pretty tasty.

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: CHRISTMAS TREE DISPLAYS: (through Jan. 8) Even the crankiest among us would struggle not to smile about something at these holiday displays. At the tree at South Street Seaport in Lower Manhattan, above, it might be the caroling, which ends this weekend with performances by the Big Apple Chorus on Friday at 6 and 7 p.m. and Saturday at 3 and 4 p.m.
the tree stays up through Jan. 4. At the Rockefeller Center tree, it might be observing visitors as they pose for photos, which they can do through Jan. 7. At the American Museum of Natural History, it could be the opportunity to create an origami ornament, using as inspiration the hundreds of colorful paper figures -- some dating back decades -- that adorn the museum's tree, which will stand through Jan. 2. Or it could be the chance to go back in time -- to the 18th century for the Neapolitan ornaments and creche figures on view through Jan. 8 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, or to the fabulous '50s for the kitschy decorations at the Merchant's House Museum through Jan. 9. Details about holiday hours and closings are in Spare Times. Grinches, don't worry
 no one will notice that fleeting grin on your face. (Anne Mancuso) (PHOTOGRAPH BY CHRIS LA PUTT)

Previews and Openings
'The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess' (in previews; opens on Jan. 12) Controversy swirled around this revival of the 1935 American folk opera when Stephen Sondheim very publicly took issue with comments made by the director, Diane Paulus, and the adapter, Suzan-Lori Parks, concerning their views on the original book by DuBose Heyward. Whether or not that scolding was the decisive factor, the creative team reportedly has now opted for a less radical overhaul than originally planned. Either way, with Audra McDonald, Norm Lewis and David Alan Grier in the lead roles, this is one of the most eagerly anticipated musical events of the Broadway season. Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (David Rooney) 
'Him' (opens this Friday) A hunky gay actor lands a breakthrough screen role, and while his boyfriend urges him to come out, his agent is determined to keep the closet door firmly shut. Clifford Streit's comedy sounds suspiciously like a retread of Douglas Carter Beane's ''Little Dog Laughed,'' but confidence in the workshop staging was so strong that the production was deemed ready for critics. Cherry Lane Studio Theater, 38 Commerce Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, cherrylanetheatre.org. (Rooney)
'How the World Began' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Jan. 5) Heidi Schreck (''Circle Mirror Transformation'') stars in Catherine Trieschmann's play about a high school biology teacher who leaves New York for rural Kansas, where an offhand remark about the origins of the universe whips up a firestorm. Don't they always? Daniella Topol directs this production from the Women's Project, in association with South Coast Rep. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'Hypnotik: The Seer Will Doctor You Now' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) Loosely based on the life of the Viennese occultist Eric Jan Hanussen, a fixture of the Berlin theater scene during the rise of the Third Reich, this new play conceived and directed by Ildiko Nemeth for New Stage Theater Company lures the audience into a ''spectacle of raw shame'' that gives way to horror. Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Rooney)
'Outside People' (in previews; opens on Jan. 10) Naked Angels and the Vineyard join forces on Zayd Dohrn's dark comedy, which explores culture-clash terrain similar to that in ''Chinglish,'' playing uptown. Directed by Evan Cabnet, the new play is set in contemporary Beijing, where a young American man falls for a Chinese woman, forcing him to consider his complex role in a foreign environment and the social, political and economic forces that shape their relationship. Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Rooney)
'The Road to Mecca' (in previews; opens on Jan. 17) Before Signature Theater Company's Athol Fugard season, beginning in February, Roundabout kicks off the South African dramatist's 80th birthday celebration with this Broadway premiere. The 1984 play about artistic freedom centers on a reclusive elderly widow whose ability to continue living independently and creating her iconoclastic sculptures is called into question by a pastor but defended by an admiring young schoolteacher. Gordon Edelstein's production stars Rosemary Harris, Carla Gugino and, in a role once played by Mr. Fugard, Jim Dale. American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Rooney)
Broadway
'Bonnie & Clyde' America's favorite kissin' outlaws (played by Laura Osnes and Jeremy Jordan) are on the run again in a modest, mildly tuneful musical by Don Black, Ivan Menchell and Frank Wildhorn. Directed by Jeff Calhoun, this show manages to find the blandness in the triple threat lure of youth, sex and violence (2:20). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
- 'The Book of Mormon' This delightful collaboration between the creators of ''South Park'' (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) and the composer of ''Avenue Q'' (Robert Lopez) is blasphemous, scurrilous and as pure-hearted as a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. No musical has so successfully had it both ways since ''The Producers.'' Casey Nicholaw is the witty co-director (with Mr. Parker) and choreographer (2:15). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Chinglish' David Henry Hwang's sporadically funny comedy about a bewildered American businessman seeking his fortune in capitalist China is laid out with the frame-by-frame exactness of a comic strip. That means this bilingual production is easy to follow but hard to embrace with enthusiasm. Leigh Silverman directs (2:00). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'An Evening With Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin' The stars of the original Broadway production of ''Evita'' are reunited on the concert stage for an eclectic evening of (mostly) love songs from the musical theater. Both are in fine vocal form, and the show is a must-have ticket for ardent fans, but the repertory is sometimes a fine fit (Stephen Sondheim) and sometimes ill-chosen (Rodgers and Hammerstein) (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
- 'Follies' The Kennedy Center's revival of James Goldman and Stephen Sondheim's musical about a reunion of Ziegfeld-style performers looks back as much in anger as in fondness, and that's what makes it so vibrant. Eric Schaeffer directs an electric cast led by Bernadette Peters, Jan Maxwell, Danny Burstein and Ron Raines (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Godspell' Oh, dear Lord: the beloved 1971 musical that turned biblical parables into teachable moments has been stuffed fruitcake-full of jokey contemporary allusions. Performed by a peppy young cast, the show is like being stuck in a rec room with kids who have been too reckless with the Red Bull (2:30). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying' Not a natural song-and-dance man, Daniel Radcliffe tries really, really hard as the amoral hero of this 1961 Frank Loesser musical about corporate ladder-climbing. Rob Ashford directed this largely charm-free revival (2:40). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Hugh Jackman: Back on Broadway' This impossibly talented, impossibly energetic actor practices safe sex like nobody else. His polished song-and-dance show is like a great, guilt-free platonic one-night stand. All he asks is that you love him loving you loving him. It's hard to deny him that (2:00). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Lysistrata Jones' Douglas Carter Beane and Lewis Flinn's endearingly escapist show -- about sex, apathy and basketball on a college campus -- brings a touch of summer sun and silliness to what has been a wintry season for musicals. Dan Knechtges directs (and choreographs) a spirited cast that includes the delicious Patti Murin in the title role (2:15). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Mountaintop' Katori Hall's surprisingly thin drama, which won the 2010 Olivier Award, depicts the last night in the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (Samuel L. Jackson) and his encounter with a feisty motel maid (Angela Bassett). Perhaps best regarded as a comfort play, a nursery-room fable for grownups (1:40). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'On a Clear Day You Can See Forever' This grim, extensively reworked revival of the Burton Lane and Alan Jay Lerner musical from 1965 appears to be suffering from a severe case of clinical depression. Harry Connick Jr. plays a psychiatrist in mourning. Michael Mayer directs Peter Parnell's revamped book (2:30). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Other Desert Cities' Jon Robin Baitz's family drama is so good that you may not even realize how good it is while you're watching it. Joe Mantello directs a sublime cast that expertly elicits the pain and the comfort of blood ties (2:15). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' The 1994 movie about Australian drag queens in the outback becomes a hyperactively splashy karaoke musical so desperate to show the audience a gaudy good time that the results are mostly enervating. Tony Sheldon brings some warmth as the transsexual Bernadette, but the show is mostly a riot of spangles, sequins and silly costumes (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Private Lives' Richard Eyre's larky (if unnecessary) revival of Noel Coward's comedy of connubial fisticuffs makes a convincing case for both the pliable talents of Kim Cattrall and the bubbly pleasures forever on tap in this play. Paul Gross is excellent as Ms. Cattrall's partner in domestic demolition (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Relatively Speaking' This slight but mostly enjoyable trio of short plays by Ethan Coen, Elaine May and Woody Allen won't do much to burnish their established reputations, but the show is chock full of nifty shtick. Marlo Thomas delights as a pampered princess with a dead husband in Ms. May's contribution (2:15). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Seminar' Alan Rickman is a virtuoso of disdain in Theresa Rebeck's shiny, facile comedy about an ego-shredding writing teacher. Full of efficiently mapped reversals, the play feels as if it were written according to the literary equivalent of a GPS device. Sam Gold directs a bright cast that includes Lily Rabe and Hamish Linklater (1:40). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Sister Act' When the good sisters of the Church of Philly Soul are rocking to raise the gothic rafters, led by the radiant Patina Miller, all is right with this stage adaptation of the hit movie about a club singer hiding out as a nun. Otherwise, this story of a bad girl teaching some good ones how to get down is innocuous but generic musical theater (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' This retooled mega-expensive musical is no longer an ungodly, indecipherable mess. It's just a bore. Recommended for less-than-precocious children with a hundred dollars to burn (2:45). Foxwoods Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (800) 745-3000, spidermanonbroadway.marvel.com. (Brantley)
'Stick Fly' Lydia R. Diamond's overstuffed but lively comedy-drama feels like a Tyler Perry melodrama (sans Madea) as revised by an academic specializing in issues of class in African-American culture. Condola Rashad gives the standout performance in the director Kenny Leon's uneven production, playing a young woman who embodies the problems of racial and class divisions that the other characters theorize about (2:15). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'War Horse' This imported British weepie, adapted from Michael Morpurgo's children's book about a cavalry horse in World War I, has the most charismatic matinee idol seen in ages: that's Joey, the title character, a puppet brought to life-size life with ineffably theatrical magic (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, (800) 432-7250, lincolncenter.org. (Brantley)
Off Broadway
'The Berenstain Bears Live! In Family Matters, the Musical' The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are onstage in this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children's book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it's rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday and Sunday only (:55). Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 5 West 63rd Street, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com. (Laurel Graeber)
- 'Blood and Gifts' J. T. Rogers's drama gives a remarkably lucid and compelling account of how the American and British view of Afghanistan as a vital front in the cold war shaped the calamitous recent history of the country. Directed with a steady hand by Bartlett Sher and featuring a first-rate cast, including Jefferson Mays as a British agent right out of a Graham Greene novel (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
- 'The Canterbury Tales Remixed' In his delightful one-man show, Baba Brinkman, a medieval literature scholar, has adapted Chaucer's 14th-century masterpiece into a hip-hop show. The conceit may sound cheesy, but Mr. Brinkman makes a surprisingly persuasive case that the two art forms are thematically (and in some cases, rhetorically) similar. Both feature thugs, dangerously beautiful women, death-defying daredevils and Creflo Dollar-esque men selling salvation. Drawing on analogies to pop anthems and celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Herman Cain, Mr. Brinkman demonstrates just how relevant these stories are (1:15). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, (866) 811-4111, sohoplayhouse.com. (Catherine Rampell)
- 'The Cherry Orchard' Andrei Belgrader's heartbreakingly funny production of Chekhov's play, which features an excellent Dianne Wiest and John Turturro, finds the tragicomic rhythms in misfired words and gestures. A delicate slapstick ballet that illuminates Chekhov's singular vision of why people fail to connect (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Brantley)
'Close Up Space' David Hyde Pierce plays a book editor estranged from his daughter in Molly Smith Metzler's listless, contrived comedy, which also features Michael Chernus as a quirky slacker and Rosie Perez as a preening novelist (1:20). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Isherwood)
- 'Cymbeline' The Fiasco Theater's charming production brings lucidity, credibility and gentle magic to Shakespeare's bulky, convoluted tale of star-crossed lovers and schemers in old Britannia, with a multifarious cast of six on a naked stage. Directed by Noah Brody and Ben Steinfeld (2:40). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'Dancing at Lughnasa' Charlotte Moore's production falls a little short on atmosphere but works where it counts most, in the spirited performances of the five women playing the poor, unmarriageable Mundy sisters in the fictional Donegal town of Ballybeg in late summer 1936. Two decades after it was first seen, this transporting Tony-winning memory play by the Irish dramatist Brian Friel has lost none of its humanity or delicacy (2:05). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Rooney)
'The Devil's Music: The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith' Miche Braden plays the bawdy-talking, hooch-swilling Bessie Smith in this show that mixes Smith's songs with talk about her life, loves and career. That format seems a bit tired, but Ms. Braden gives it her all (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'Farm Boy' Leaping ahead by two generations from ''War Horse,'' this sequel by the novelist Michael Morpurgo, adapted and directed for the stage by Daniel Buckroyd, casts its elegiac gaze over vanishing agricultural traditions in rural England. Presented as part of the Brits Off Broadway series, the short, family-friendly play uses simple old-fashioned (and puppet-free) storytelling to thread together the bond between a young man and his grandfather, the history of a rusty tractor and a memorable episode from late in the lives of Albert and Joey, the human and equine protagonists of ''War Horse'' (1:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; 59e59.org, britsoffbroadway.com. (Rooney)
'Happy Hour' Two ounces misanthropy, one of anomie and a dash of bitters is the recipe in Ethan Coen's latest cocktail of short plays. Directed by Neil Pepe, these three slivers of bleak comedy add up to one wearying evening of theater (2:00). Peter Norton Space at Signature Theater Company, 552 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
'Kissing Sid James' A lonely man and woman take a chance and spend the weekend together in this funny if overlong comedy, part of the Brits Off Broadway festival (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Ken Jaworowski)
'Neighbourhood Watch' Alan Ayckbourn's latest comedy finds a mild-mannered middle-aged brother and sister (the excellent Matthew Cottle and Alexandra Mathie) leading a committee to rein in petty crime in their community, with results that practically turn their patch of British suburbia into a police state. The charms of the idiomatic cast help make up for the sometimes wayward plotting (2:35). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Isherwood)
'Once' This gently appealing, imaginatively staged new musical about funky young composers in love doesn't always sustain the understated charm of the 2006 cult movie that inspired it. But it often finds depth in its songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova). John Tiffany directs a cast led by Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, nytw.org. (Brantley)
'Rent' Maybe they should call it ''Sublet.'' The young cast members who inhabit this premature revival of Jonathan Larson's watershed rock opera from 1996, directed by Michael Greif, never seem to feel truly at home. It is as if they're reluctant to make this show their own (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Shlemiel the First' This enticing adaptation of Isaac Bashevis Singer's folk tales uses a delightful klezmer score and a game orchestra to prop up the frequently shopworn material. You may find yourself both checking your watch and tapping your toe (1:30). Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, skirballcenter.nyu.edu. (Eric Grode)
'Silence! The Musical' A silly, coarse musical spin on ''The Silence of the Lambs'' as pitched to obsessive fans (1:30). 9th Space Theater at Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, silencethemusical.com. (Jason Zinoman)
'Sistas: The Musical' The script is obvious, covering virtually every issue that might touch the lives of black women, but Dorothy Marcic's good-natured, low-budget musical is all about the songs. From ''Ain't Nobody's Business if I Do'' to ''Single Ladies,'' you could do a lot worse (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'Sleep No More' Punchdrunk, a British site-specific theater company, has taken over three abandoned warehouses to enact the sorry sights of the murderous Macbeths' career as a movable orgy. The result suggests what might have happened if Stanley Kubrick (of ''The Shining'') had designed the Haunted Mansion at Disney World (2:00). The McKittrick Hotel, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, sleepnomorenyc.com. (Brantley)
- 'Sons of the Prophet' Stephen Karam's wonderful new play is a comedy about how we endure the unendurable. Santino Fontana leads a flawless cast in a kaleidoscopic portrait of the woes that befall a family of Lebanese extraction and the people in their orbit. As smart and funny as it is deeply compassionate (1:45). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Traces' An energizing evening of acrobatics from the Montreal troupe Seven Fingers. Think of it as cirque du cabaret, in which a group of distinctive talents get to show off the physical equivalents of individual song stylings (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Voca People' This show features space aliens, but it's really all about a cappella music. The visitors have crash-landed on Earth in a ship powered by music, and lots of singing must be done to refuel their ship. The eight singers sound pretty good, despite some overamplification. But most of the show consists of fragments of songs, which becomes annoying; only when the cast is allowed to cut loose and deliver an entire song -- the Doors' ''People Are Strange'' is a highlight -- do things reach their full potential (1:30). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
Extravaganzas
'Bai Xi' Young jaws drop as only slightly less young bodies flip, climb, contort and soar in this collection of traditional and modern Chinese acrobatics. Parents: You may want to move the mattress to the floor when you get home (1:30). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (646) 562-2200, newvictory.org. (Grode)
'Big Apple Circus: Dream Big' This one-ring circus may not offer big cats, but it does have large rodents -- a capybara and an African crested porcupine, no less -- in its new show. Fortunately, the circus has lost none of its intimacy this season, whose highlights include terrific trapeze and acrobatics, bravura magic and the farewell antics of Barry Lubin, doing his final turn as the clown known as Grandma (2:15). Damrosch Park, 62nd Street between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, Lincoln Center, (888) 541-3750, bigapplecircus.org. (Graeber)
'Cathy Rigby Is Peter Pan' Cathy Rigby is back yet again as the title character in a show that keeps young eyes wide open in wonder (2:10). Theater at Madison Square Garden, (866) 858-0008, theateratmsg.com. (Jaworowski)

HEADLINE: For Transgender Detainees, a Jail Policy Offers Some Security

BYLINE: By ADRIENNE LU. 
alu@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
For as long as she can remember, Maribel said, she has felt that she was different. She was born a boy in Mexico, and came to the United States at 16. Two years later, she started taking hormone pills and later underwent some operations to become physically the woman she always believed herself to be.
Maribel, 40, concedes she has long lived on the margins of society, never holding down a job and bouncing in and out of jail over the years.
In March, she was charged with retail theft and sent to Cook County Jail. Despite her shoulder-length hair, fuller lips and breasts, Maribel (who agreed to be interviewed on the condition that only her first name be used) was housed with male detainees. 
''It was horrible,'' she said. ''Sometimes words hurt more than a punch. People can be very cruel.'' After two weeks she was moved to the women's division, where she remains while awaiting trial.
Also in March, Cook County Jail instituted a new policy for detainees like Maribel, who either identify themselves as transgender or are identified by the jail's medical staff as having gender-identity disorder, the formal diagnosis for those who feel at odds with their sex at birth.
Under the policy, which covers procedures for housing, clothing, showering, grooming, medical care and other aspects of life in jail, a gender identity committee meets periodically to determine and review plans for each transgender detainee. Among the decisions the committee makes is whether the detainee should be housed with men or women.
Of the 60 or so transgender detainees who have entered the jail since the new policy took effect, only two -- Maribel and another person who was born with male anatomy but identifies as a woman -- have been housed with women, jail officials said. All of the others, who were born male but identify as women, are housed with men but have opted for protective custody and are kept separately from the other detainees, a choice available to anyone entering the jail.
Sheriff Thomas J. Dart said he instituted the new procedures when he realized that the jail -- which holds an average daily population of about 8,900, primarily consisting of people awaiting trial -- did not have a policy on how to deal with transgender detainees.
In one of his weekly meetings of jail officials, ''when it came up, I asked around the room what everyone's thoughts were on it, and there was a collective pause,'' Mr. Dart said. ''It just became clear to me that we needed to have a more affirmative position.''
Jails around the country are starting to address the difficult and sensitive issue of how to deal with transgender detainees. Lawsuits over their mistreatment have focused more attention on the issue. Another factor has been increased knowledge about the vulnerability of transgender detainees and inmates, in part due to the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003.
Randi Ettner, an Evanston psychologist who is chairwoman of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health's Committee for Incarcerated Persons, said policies dealing specifically with transgender inmates are critical for protecting their safety and health.
''I've been in many other prison settings where patients who need and require medical interventions are ignored,'' said Dr. Ettner, who helped the Cook County Jail staff craft their policy. ''They're inappropriately treated when they do receive treatment and, sadly, this has led to a lot of self-harm in prison systems,'' including attempts to castrate themselves to rid their bodies of testosterone.
About 1 in 11,000 men and 1 in 30,000 women are born with gender-identity disorder, Dr. Ettner said. Treatment typically consists of psychological, hormonal and sometimes surgical approaches.
The issue is a significant concern for corrections officials because transgender people are more likely to end up in jail than the general population. A 2011 report based on a survey of 6,450 people described as transgender or gender nonconforming, sponsored by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality, said: ''They are more likely to interact with police because they are more likely to be victims of violent crime, because they are more likely to be on the street due to homelessness and/or being unwelcome at home, because their circumstances often force them to work in the underground economy, and even because many face harassment and arrest simply because they are out in public while being transgender.''
Seven percent of respondents reported being arrested or detained in jail due only to their gender identity.
Sexual assaults are 13 times more prevalent among transgender inmates than the general prison population, according to a 2007 University of California, Irvine, study of California state prisons.
Transgender detainees are sometimes inappropriately placed in solitary confinement or mental health facilities in misguided efforts to protect their safety, experts said. Lack of access to hormone therapy, counseling and other medical services is another common problem for transgender detainees.
In August, a United States Court of Appeals upheld the right of transgender people to receive medical care while in jail, agreeing with a Federal District Court decision that overturned a 2005 Wisconsin law that prohibited doctors from prescribing medically necessary hormone therapy or sex reassignment surgery to inmates.
Harper Jean Tobin, policy counsel for the National Center for Transgender Equality, said that Cook County Jail's transgender policy is among the stronger in the nation, along with those in Cumberland County, Me., and the District of Columbia.
Owen Daniel-McCarter, project attorney with the Transformative Justice Law Project of Illinois, which offers low-income transgender people free criminal legal services, said the most noticeable change at the jail is his clients' improved access to hormone therapy, although some have complained that they have not received the right kinds of hormones or the right doses.
''The physical, mental and emotional effects of being pulled from hormones overnight is devastating,'' Mr. Daniel-McCarter said. ''People will go into suicidal ideations. It's like going into menopause overnight.'' For clients who have been taking hormones since they were teenagers and never went through male puberty, a cessation of treatment can be very difficult and result in irreversible changes, he added.
Although Maribel has never changed her birth name legally, she has gone by Maribel for 23 years. She said she was grateful that she had been transferred to the women's division, where she has been working on turning around her life.
''I'm so glad somebody made the decision,'' Maribel said, wiping away tears. ''I've learned that I don't have to do nothing I really don't want to do just to please people. I know I can survive here.''

HEADLINE: The Sidney Awards, Part II

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Book tours are lonely, yet after spending four months promoting his novel ''Freedom,'' Jonathan Franzen went to an island 500 miles off the coast of Chile to be alone. He got at least one thing out of it, a profound essay in The New Yorker called ''Farther Away,'' the winner of another of this year's Sidney Awards.
Franzen's theme is solitude. He writes about Robinson Crusoe, the emergence of the novel, the potentially isolating effect of the Internet, and the suicide of his friend, the writer David Foster Wallace. 
''He was a lifelong prisoner on the island of himself,'' Franzen writes of his friend. ''To prove once and for all that he truly didn't deserve to be loved, it was necessary to betray as hideously as possible those who loved him best, by killing himself at home and making them firsthand witness to his act.''
Wallace emerges as a person who defined the extreme end of the isolation spectrum. Franzen is a bit down the scale, which explains what is best in his writing (his incredible powers of observation) and what is worst (his coolness toward his own characters). Many people with writerly personalities share these traits. You can also find a few of them, oddly, in politics.
Many of the best public-policy essays of the year tackled the interconnected subjects of inequality, wage stagnation and the loss of economic dynamism. If anybody wants a deeper understanding of these issues, I'd recommend a diverse melange of articles: ''The Broken Contract'' by George Packer in Foreign Affairs; ''The Inequality That Matters'' by Tyler Cowen in The American Interest; ''The Rise of the New Global Elite'' by Chrystia Freeland in The Atlantic; and ''Beyond the Welfare State'' in National Affairs by Yuval Levin.
Each essay has insights that complicate the familiar partisan story lines. Cowen, for example, notes that income inequality is on the way up while the inequality of personal well-being is on the way down. One hundred years ago, John D. Rockefeller lived a very different life than the average wage earner, who worked six days a week, never took vacations and had no access to the world's culture. Today, both you and Bill Gates enjoy the Internet, important new pharmaceuticals and good cheap food.
Anybody who is on antidepressants, or knows somebody who is, should read Marcia Angell's series ''The Epidemic of Mental Illness: Why?'' from The New York Review of Books. Many of us have been taught that depression arises, in part, from chemical imbalances in the brain. Apparently, there is no evidence to support that.
Many of us thought that antidepressants work. Apparently, there is meager evidence to support that, too. They may work slightly better than placebos, Angell argues, but only under certain circumstances. They may also be permanently altering people's brains and unintentionally fueling the plague of mental illness by causing episodes of mania, for example. I wouldn't consider Angell the last word on this, but it's certainly a viewpoint worth learning about.
Speaking about medicine gone wrong, Ethan Gutmann had a chilling piece in The Weekly Standard called ''The Xinjiang Procedure'' about organ harvesting in China. Prisoners are executed by firing squads and then, as they are slowly dying, doctors are rushed in to harvest livers and kidneys. Gutmann spoke with doctors compelled to perform this procedure:
''Even as Enver stitched the man back up -- not internally, there was no point to that anymore, just so the body might look presentable -- he sensed the man was still alive. 'I am a killer,' Enver screamed inwardly. He did not dare to look at the man's face again.''
GQ magazine had a very good year with several fine articles. One of them was ''The Movie Set That Ate Itself'' by Michael Idov. It is about the movie director Ilya Khrzhanovsky who set out to make a film about Stalinism. He took over a Ukrainian city, amassed a cast of thousands and had them live in his own totalitarian city. They were forbidden to utter words or use technologies that did not exist in 1952. He redid the plumbing pipes so the toilets would sound like toilets from 1952. Actors and technicians had to answer to his every whim.
Hundreds left or were purged from the movie project, but many more were sucked in by the totalitarian mind-set, snitching on confederates, living in fear. Idov ends up denouncing his own photographer, after Khrzhanovsky turns against him.
Every year there are more outstanding essays than I have space to mention, but this year's selection process has been the hardest. The Internet is everywhere, but this is a golden age of long-form journalism, and I could have chosen 50 pieces as good as the ones above. Click on The Browser, Longform.org and Arts & Letters Daily for links to more. Tweets are fun, but essays you'll remember.

HEADLINE: Many Ski Areas Lack an Essential Ingredient

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH; Dan Frosch contributed reporting from Denver, and Jess Bidgood from Boston.

 BODY:
WEST DOVER, Vt. -- There were far too many skis on hand this week at High Altitude, a rental shop on the road to Mount Snow here, and Andrew Glover, the manager, was far too lonely.
The problem was the weather. Week after maddening week of unusually balmy temperatures have made snowfall scant in New England, and, worse, wreaked havoc on snowmaking at ski resorts that like to have a healthy base of, at the least, manmade snow by Christmas.
Many ski areas opened late this year, and the slow start is threatening the fragile economy of towns that rely heavily on the ski traffic that usually starts in earnest over the holidays. Hundreds of seasonal workers have been unable to start their jobs, while some innkeepers report far more empty rooms than is customary during the holidays.
''We opened two weeks before Thanksgiving, and to this point we haven't even done $2,500 worth of sales,'' said Mr. Glover, whose shop also sells ski and snowboarding gear. ''It's been wacky weather, and it's been really tough.'' 
Nor is the frustration limited to the Northeast. Out West, some of the country's more famous ski resorts have been waiting for the steady snowfall that made last year an epic season, dumping seemingly endless amounts of fresh powder.
At Squaw Valley in Olympic Valley, Calif., near Lake Tahoe only 15 percent of the mountain was open this week. Just 12 inches of snow had fallen at the base of the resort and 26 inches on the upper mountain, by far the lowest in a decade for this time of year. (By this point in 2010, the resort had received 135 inches at the base and 246 inches on its upper mountain.) At Alta Ski Area, near Salt Lake City, the base depth was 34 inches, compared with 105 inches last year at this time.
''People are just ready to sacrifice someone to the gods,'' said Bill Clifford of Cumberland, Me., who plans to spend the holiday week with his family at Sugarloaf, where 15 out of 153 trails were open on Thursday. ''Everyone's depressed, knowing those limited trails will be crowded and not very much fun.''
On the few days and nights that temperatures have dropped and lingered below the mid-20s, ski areas in the Northeast have gone into manic snowmaking mode. Bill Stenger, president and chief executive of Jay Peak Resort in Jay, Vt., said the resort had been able to make snow on about 15 days this season, about half the usual number.
''We're going like hell'' on days that are cold enough to fire up the snow guns, he said. ''Our guys are working 24 hours a day.''
But those efforts have been foiled at times -- as on Wednesday, when temperatures rose into the 40s in southern Vermont.
''If Mother Nature's not going to give us the snow, she's got to give us the temperatures,'' said David Meeker, a spokesman for Mount Snow, where 16 of 80 trails were open on Thursday.
Jiminy Peak Mountain Resort, in Hancock, Mass., opened on Dec. 10, a few weeks later than its usual Thanksgiving start, delaying paychecks for hundreds of seasonal workers. Brian Fairbank, president and chief executive, said that about 800 skiers had visited the ski area by mid-December, down from 3,000 by that point last year. ''The Valium bottle in my drawer -- I haven't taken it out yet or opened it yet,'' Mr. Fairbank said. ''But it's close.''
Mad River Glen, a ski area in Waitsfield, Vt., which prides itself on making minimal snow and relying almost entirely on the natural kind, has yet to open at all. ''There's probably about 45 people waiting just to start work,'' said Jamey Wimble, Mad River's president and chief executive.
At Okemo Mountain Resort in Ludlow, Vt., 33 trails were open on Tuesday, compared with 70 or 80 this time last year, said Bonnie MacPherson, the resort's spokeswoman. Okemo has focused on where it is easiest to make snow, she said: high on the mountain, which means intermediate and advanced trails.
In Colorado, ski areas like Keystone and Arapahoe Basin had opened less than half of their terrain, although colder temperatures were allowing snow-making machines to keep runs open and both had a few inches of snowfall this week.
In both the East and the West, ski industry workers said it was too soon to predict how the season would shape up, because December snowfall is typically fickle. Parts of Vermont and Massachusetts were eagerly expecting a few inches overnight Thursday and Friday morning.
''We know the snow will come,'' said Jennifer Rudolph, spokeswoman for Colorado Ski Country USA, a trade association that represents 22 of the state's ski resorts.
There is a bright spot: northern New Mexico, where Taos Ski Valley has received more than 50 inches of snow this month, compared with only six last December. ''This is the best opening we've had since 2002,'' said Adriana Blake, a spokeswoman.
At Vermont's Mount Snow, an arsenal of some 250 fan guns and 800 air water guns have built the base depth to 10 to 18 inches and, thanks to cold temperatures over the weekend, doubled the resort's skiable terrain between Friday and Tuesday. Mr. Fairbank, of Jiminy Peak, said he had flown a small plane over a number of ski areas in the region on Monday, snapping pictures of slopes covered with (manmade) snow to send the 100,000 people on his resort's e-mail list.
Still, he and others said it was famously hard to motivate people to venture north on a ski trip if their home turf was still grassy.
''When people are still able to play golf down in Connecticut,'' said Mark Wallace, owner of First Trax Sports Shop in West Dover, ''they're not thinking about coming up here.''
Deb Buehler, who owns the Red Oak Inn in West Dover, a few miles from Mount Snow, said she had 22 guests last Christmas but no bookings until Dec. 29 this year. But Mr. Meeker said the resort's hotel and condominiums were mostly booked for the week after Christmas.
At Stratton Mountain in southern Vermont, where 18 of 94 trails were open on Wednesday and the afternoon temperature was 39 degrees at the summit, Myra Foster, the marketing manager, said there had been a few cancellations for the Christmas week.
''People are really waiting to see,'' she said. ''Everyone's keeping their fingers crossed.''
T. J. Raab, a skier from Hoboken, N.J., who coordinates a ski-house share with 17 other people in Killington, Vt., said he had skied there last weekend but that with limited terrain open, the trails felt crowded.
''We skied from 8 to 10, and by then we were like, We need to get off this mountain,'' Mr. Raab said. ''You feel like you're going to get crushed.''
But Tristan Grush, 14, of West Dover, said he had skied 10 trails at Mount Snow last weekend and found the terrain ''really nice.'' The ribbons of white on the otherwise brown mountain lift his spirit, he said.
''When I'm skiing, I feel like it's winter,'' he said. ''You go to the mountain and it reboots your faith.''

HEADLINE: How to Trim Spending on Medicare

 BODY:
To the Editor:
No one disagrees that ''traditional Medicare has improved the health and financial security for countless older Americans,'' as you point out (''Working With Medicare,'' editorial, Dec. 18). The problem is that the program is headed for eventual bankruptcy. You propose numerous cost-control approaches by government, but not the competition that controls costs in every other area of our society. Free markets rely on price signals, complete information and ''skin in the game'' to guide consumers to economic choices.
We need insurance plans (health savings accounts?) that give patients a stake in careful spending. Then, require that doctors, hospitals, and pharmaceutical and insurance companies maintain Web sites that disclose prices for all services. Some providers will choose to compete on price; others will compete on service. 
Consumers will choose what works for them, and the competition will limit the increase in health care costs without price controls on almost 20 percent of the economy.
PETER COFFEY Madison, Conn., Dec. 18, 2011
To the Editor:
I agree that ''Working With Medicare'' could save hundreds of billions of dollars without shifting huge burdens onto beneficiaries. As a former health fraud investigator, I especially appreciate your recommendation for a more orderly system. Simply put, an easy-to-understand Medicare program could significantly reduce the skyrocketing costs of unnecessary medical services and fraud.
Traditional Medicare currently offers Parts A, B and D, each with a different annual deductible, co-payment and monthly premium. Plus, many beneficiaries have retiree and/or supplement plans that pay for the gaps in Medicare coverage, which adds another layer of confusion.
A better approach would be to convert Medicare into an understandable program with one monthly premium, a standard co-payment for all services and a requirement that beneficiaries must be informed about the cost of a service before a claim is submitted to Medicare. Then patients would realize the true cost for their care, and they could report fraud or suspicious claims before they are paid by Medicare.
THOMAS M. CASSIDY Setauket, N.Y., Dec. 19, 2011
The writer, an economist, is a clinical associate professor in the School of Social Welfare at Stony Brook University.
To the Editor:
''Working With Medicare'' got it mostly right -- relentlessly rising costs in the health sector over all are the problem, not Medicare. But that is exactly why proposals that simply shift costs away from the federal government and onto Medicare beneficiaries, like increased cost sharing, means-tested premiums or increasing the eligibility age to 67, are ineffective and dangerous.
They don't get at the real problem, and so in a few years (or months) we will just need to hit beneficiaries again, even though half of them have annual incomes of $22,000 or less and already spend almost 15 percent of their income on health care.
We need to implement, and supplement, reforms in the Affordable Care Act that begin to bend the cost curve. As these reforms take time to deliver, we should not penalize the most vulnerable among us by increasing their costs because they are older or sicker.
JOE BAKER President, Medicare Rights Center New York, Dec. 19, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''For Medicare, We Must Cut Costs, Not Shift Them,'' by Ezekiel J. Emanuel (column, New York Times on the Web, Dec. 19):
Dr. Emanuel's solution, to change how we pay doctors and hospitals, makes no sense. It will worsen access and punish the end users without making meaningful structural changes in how we deliver care.
We are facing a megatrend of aging baby boomers with a program whose funding was designed in the 1960s. Traditional Medicare is highly efficient. It should be conserved and strengthened. Cost shifting will do little to address the legitimate costs of an aging population for whom costs rise about 5 percent for each year over 65, according to a study several years ago.
Moreover, the burgeoning population of those over 85 will drive costs much higher. Medicare is now a program for the most costly part of the population. We should bring low-risk populations into Medicare, merging it with Medicaid and making it open to all Americans.
Shift the funding exclusively to progressive income taxes and means-adjusted premiums. Permit Medicare to establish a national formulary to negotiate drug costs. If we encompass a larger cross-section of the public in Medicare, we will create a platform to address health care spending equitably.

HEADLINE: For $101,000, the 12 Days of Christmas Are Covered

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
Giving the holiday presents of a French hen, a milking maid, a leaping lord or even a partridge in a pear tree is rather unlikely in this day and age. But the gifts from the favorite holiday carol ''The 12 Days of Christmas'' are lighthearted clues to how the economy is faring.
Over all, prices are fairly stable and not rising precipitously for even the quirkier gifts, according to the Christmas Price Index released for the 28th year by PNC Wealth Management, part of the PNC Financial Services Group. On the down side, the price tag for the eye-popping 364 items and services in each of the song's verses breaks $100,000 for the first time this year. 
Bestowing the gifts would cost 3.5 percent more than it did last year. The price, which reflects weaker consumer demand in a fragile economy, mirrors the federal government's Consumer Price Index, which increased 3.4 percent this year for the far more pedestrian items used by today's consumer. The latest figures for the year were released by the Department of Labor last week.
While even the most determined would find it daunting to gather a round of the 12 different gifts, prices for some staple items in the song's elaborate verses have fallen, perhaps offering a little consolation.
Gold, for example -- as in the five golden rings -- has fallen in price. Those rings (fairly lightweight ones, one would think) come to $645, down from $649.95 last year. Even though gold commodities, an investor haven, have been hovering at record highs recently, the demand for gold at retail has been weakening.
''Our five golden rings dropped by 0.8 percent this year,'' said James P. Dunigan, PNC Wealth Management's managing executive of investments.
But Mr. Dunigan notes that the index research is not scientific -- prices are gathered from state and local sources. The National Jeweler, a trade publication that tracks jewelry sales, found in November that some jewelers were complaining that shoppers had ''sticker shock'' when looking for gold gifts or wedding rings.
Unsurprisingly, labor costs remained fairly flat. The nine ladies dancing, for example, remained static, at $6,294, the same as last year, according to figures from Philadanco, a dance company in Philadelphia. The 11 pipers piping, at a price of $2,427.60, and 12 drummers drumming, for $2,629.90, were up modestly, about 3 percent. The only unskilled laborers in the verses are the eight maids-a-milking, who are calculated as earning the $7.25 minimum hourly wage. That wage did not rise in 2011 for the second straight year, so their cost stayed the same.
The price tag for one round of gifts is $24,263.18 this year, up $823.80 from last year. Repeating the gifts totaled slightly more than $101,000, a gain of 4.4 percent, also close to the federal price index.
''Typically we see parallels between our index and the federal government's,'' Mr. Dunigan said, ''which was not the case last year. Still, we are talking about a small basket of goods and services here compared to the Consumer Price Index.''
And like the federal government's index, the PNC index also measures a core index that excludes the swans, a bird that has a fluctuating price history because of varying supply and demand. This year the core index rose only 0.7 percent. That compares with the core Consumer Price Index which, according to federal figures, rose 2.2 percent this year, and excludes volatile food and energy costs.
The price for the swans rose by 12.5 percent, almost double last year's rise of 6.7 percent, to $6,300. Aside from the swans, bird prices were more moderate this year as demand decreased. The cost and availability of bird feed for the two turtle doves pushed their prices up by 25 percent (still less than the 78.6 percent rise in 2010) to $125, but the three French hens remained the same, at $150.
The partridge rose 14.2 percent, to $15, and the pear tree jumped 13.3 percent, to $169. The four calling birds dropped 13.3 percent, to almost $520. Figures for the fowl came from the National Aviary in Pittsburgh.
Shopping online offered only convenience. It would cost $39,860 to buy the 12 different presents, about 16.1 percent more than last year and nearly $16,000 more than this year's traditional index. All 364 gifts totaled $174,382 on the Internet, as shipping costs ''more than overcame any convenience factor of shopping online,'' Mr. Dunigan said.
As the index has emerged as a popular teaching tool for students, PNC comes up with new digital presentations each year. This year, its Web site, at pncchristmaspriceindex.com, has an interactive train journey through a winter setting. Riders stop at each site to collect gifts, and a calculator adds it up.

HEADLINE: Markets Push Toward a Positive Year-End

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Thursday, putting the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index on the cusp of finishing out the year higher as another decline in jobless claims pointed to further improvement in the labor market.
With the benchmark index near break-even year-to-date and the Dow Jones industrial average already higher for 2011, stocks in the United States appeared on track to outperform such major overseas markets as China, Brazil and Europe, all of which are down more than 10 percent year-to-date.
The latest bit of optimism on Wall Street came from a drop in weekly claims for jobless benefits to a three-and-a-half-year low. Also helping equities, consumer sentiment improved in December, hitting its highest level in six months as Americans felt better about the economy's prospects. 
''This is supportive of the fact that the economy is gaining momentum and that the fourth quarter will be much better than people were expecting even just a month ago,'' said James McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust Global Investments in Chicago.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 61.91 points, or 0.51 percent, at 12,169.65. The S.& P. 500 index was up 10.28 points, or 0.83 percent, at 1,254. The Nasdaq composite index was up 21.48 points, or 0.83 percent, at 2,599.45.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 5/32, to 100 14/32. The yield fell to 1.95 percent, from 1.97 percent late Wednesday.
Cyclicals, which have come under pressure recently from uncertainties over global growth, were the day's top gainers, with financials gaining 2.1 percent, followed by energy up 1.1 percent and materials, up 0.9 percent.
Consumer staples, considered a defensive play, was the weakest sector, falling 0.2 percent.
Banks were among the top performers in European and American equity markets. Traders said the European Central Bank's cheap loans to lenders would help ease their funding strains.
The S.& P. financial sector added 2.05 percent.
Analysts said the European Central Bank's first-ever tender of ultra-cheap three-year loans Wednesday was not giving much support to the euro. Doubts remained over how much of the funds will be lent to help the ailing euro zone economy or used to buy sovereign debt of struggling economies as banks deleverage and cut back exposure to government bonds.
''European leaders are not fixing the crisis and they are not doing the things necessary to fix it,'' said Paul Dietrich, chief executive and co-chief investment officer at Foxhall Capital Management in Orange, Conn. ''They talk, but they're not backing up the talk with anything like what we did in the United States. And it's not the sovereigns that is causing this crisis, but the banks themselves.''
The euro edged up less than 0.1 percent to $1.3051, off the session peak of $1.3119, according to Reuters data. It remains within a cent of a one-month low hit last week.
Investors warned that a year-end rally would not necessarily translate into elevated expectations for 2012 because many of the issues that hit the market this year, like slow growth and Europe's debt crisis, remained unresolved.
''Next year will be a tug of war between better economic data here and the prospects for emerging market growth to pick up on one hand, with the European debt crisis on the other side of the rope,'' Mr. McDonald said.
The CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of investor fear, fell 1.26 percent and is down about 13 percent so far this week, putting it on track for four weeks of declines.
Lower volume ahead of the Christmas and New Year's Day holidays has left the market susceptible to heightened volatility this week.
Micron Technology jumped 15.7 percent to $6.41 as investors looked past limp quarterly results announced late Wednesday and focused on a potential 2012 rebound in long-stagnant memory chip demand and prices.
Tibco Software, the business software maker, climbed 8 percent to $23.76 after it forecast first-quarter revenue above estimates and said fourth-quarter profit and revenue soared.
American Greetings slumped 21.1 percent to $13.39 after third-quarter profit dropped nearly 40 percent and it warned of higher expenses in 2012.

HEADLINE: Fire at Home in Texas Ends Former Iraq Commander's Run for the Senate

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
SAN ANTONIO -- Ricardo S. Sanchez rummaged through a pile of charred rubble in the backyard of his home here one recent morning. He picked up a small book with ripped and stuck-together pages. It was a prayer book one of his children had given his wife. He found what appeared to be a blackened, soggy rag. Unfolding it, he realized he was holding his daughter's baptismal dress.
Last month, on Veterans Day, his two-story brick home was devastated by a fire that engulfed the garage, his daughter's Ford Explorer and much of the roof and attic. A retired three-star general who served in Kuwait, Kosovo and Iraq, he had seen war in the past, but not in his present, here at his home, among the carefully landscaped streets of a gated community called Inwood.
''I turned the corner, and I saw the Explorer and I saw the garage and I was in Iraq,'' said Mr. Sanchez, recalling the moment he saw the damage with his friend Donald T. Phillips. 
''I looked around and, I guess the Fire Department were the ones that did it: my helmet, my old helmet, was sitting on top of the washer. The car is completely burned. There's no rubber left on it. There's no tires, no glass. I looked around for about a minute and I turned to Don and I said, 'The only thing that's missing is the skeletons, from the scenes that I saw in Iraq.' '' The fire ruined his home, and destroyed most of his personal notes, maps, plaques and other memorabilia from his 33-year Army career. And ultimately it took something else as well: his candidacy for the United States Senate. Mr. Sanchez announced in May that he was entering the race to replace Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican, who is retiring. Last Friday, five weeks after the fire, he announced he was withdrawing.
He had tried to balance his entry into politics with the trauma of the fire and other personal ordeals. In September, his wife, Maria Elena, underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor. The fire came two months later.
While he and his wife made plans to tear down the house to the foundation and have it rebuilt, they moved into their daughter's home nearby and slept on a trundle bed, while their grown son, who had also been living with them, slept on the floor. Mr. Sanchez had two or three changes of clothes. And then this month, while playing racquetball, he hit the back of his head against a wall and suffered a concussion.
''I'm a man of great faith,'' Mr. Sanchez said. ''It's almost like I'm getting these signals that, wait a minute, this isn't right for you. Have I shut the doors? No, I haven't. But at this point in time, the timing just wasn't right, given all the circumstances.''
Mr. Sanchez, 60, a diminutive, soft-spoken man, displays none of the ego or bluster one might expect from the former top American commander in Iraq. He favors abortion rights and gay rights, and was running for the Senate as a Democrat, pushing for tax cuts for small businesses, investments in clean energy and support for unemployment benefits.
The son of a welder, Mr. Sanchez grew up in an impoverished Mexican-American community in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. He tucked cardboard in his shoes because his family could not afford new ones, and the first house he lived in had one room and no doors, plumbing or electricity. He joined the Junior R.O.T.C. in high school and rose through the ranks of the Army to become one of the highest-ranking Hispanics in the United States military.
He once presided over press briefings in Baghdad that were watched around the world, particularly in December 2003 after the capture of Saddam Hussein. These days, when he eats breakfast at Jim's Restaurant, out of uniform and wearing a suit, no one seems to recognize him.
Long before the fire, his campaign had struggled.
His acting campaign manager had been his friend Mr. Phillips, an author who collaborated with him on the former general's 2008 memoir, ''Wiser in Battle: A Soldier's Story.'' He had raised about $250,000, a paltry sum for a Democrat seeking statewide office in a Republican-dominated state. No Democrat has been elected to a statewide executive office in Texas since 1994.
''I thought he was very impressive, but had not fully internalized how enormous of a task it is to run a statewide campaign in Texas,'' said Harvey Kronberg, the editor of The Quorum Report, an online Texas political journal. ''When you're trying to project a message, we have 4 of the 10 most expensive media markets in the country. Sanchez had a great story, but no brand ID, no recognition. Were there $15 million available to him, he could have made a reasonable run.''
He acknowledged that he struggled, describing how he interviewed 12 people for campaign manager in recent months, though no one who was offered the job accepted. ''It was a tough road ahead, and we clearly understood that,'' he said. ''Some people called it a gamble and definitely a long shot. But I went into it fully understanding that.''
Beyond his fund-raising troubles, political observers viewed him as a problematic candidate for Democrats. General Sanchez was forced to retire in 2006 after the prisoner abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib, which occurred on his watch.
An independent panel appointed by Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld to investigate abuse of detainees found in its August 2004 report that General Sanchez had failed to ensure proper staff oversight of detention and interrogation operations. In his book, he described the report as being ''designed to protect Secretary Rumsfeld,'' and during the interview he said that the military leadership never condoned, supported or advocated abuse of detainees. ''None of that was ever done by the command.''
Outside his house, Mr. Sanchez put the few items he had collected in a plastic bag. He estimated that the fire caused nearly $1 million in damage to the house and its contents. Fire Department officials said the fire was accidental and apparently electrical, but Mr. Sanchez said his insurance company was continuing its investigation.
Mr. Sanchez said he had never felt threatened, but he remained somewhat suspicious about the cause of the fire. Had it not been for the fire, he added, he would still be in the race. Mr. Phillips recalled that sectarian forces in Iraq had reportedly put a bounty on Mr. Sanchez's head. The former general chuckled softly. ''Well, I don't know that it was ever rescinded,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Silent Night (or Two) for Gingrich After a Barrage of Ads Attacking Him

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Santa Claus is bringing a very special present for Newt Gingrich this weekend: a bit of relief.
The independent ''super PAC'' supporting Mitt Romney's campaign, which has run some of the most brutal attack ads against Mr. Gingrich, has said it will stop broadcasting them on Saturday and Sunday, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.
But the reprieve will be short-lived for Mr. Gingrich, whose campaign of ''ideas'' has been largely sidetracked for days as he attempts to push back against the relentless barrage of attacks against him. The ads are expected to return in force on Monday. 
For Mr. Gingrich, the ads have all but consumed his campaign. Rather than talk about the economy, the president or any of his ideas, Mr. Gingrich has spent days urging Mr. Romney and his other rivals to mount a positive campaign.
''All he's got to do is simple,'' Mr. Gingrich told reporters this week after Mr. Romney declined to urge the super PAC, which is barred from coordinating with the Romney campaign, to stop running the negative ads. ''This afternoon he can say, 'I ask that PAC to run only positive ads.' Anything short of that is baloney.''
Mr. Gingrich has vowed not to respond in kind to the attacks, but has been largely unable to move off the subject. He has talked about his criticism of judges, but even his latest ad -- in which he wishes voters a happy holiday -- complains about the lack of a positive campaign.
Strategists for Mr. Gingrich are hoping that voters punish his rivals. Candidates who continue to attack during the week between Christmas and New Year's Day risk a backlash from voters who may view the negativity as especially dissonant with the spirit of the holidays.
''Therein lies the quandary: With the caucuses right around the corner, do you want to let up on the gas pedal?'' said Tim Albrecht, a spokesman for Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, a Republican.
Mr. Albrecht predicted that the negative campaigning by most of the Republican candidates would continue, perhaps with a break for a day or two around Christmas. He cited polls showing a higher-than-usual number of undecided voters this close to caucus day.
Most of the negative advertisements this year, he said, are offered by super PACs, which are not required to identify themselves as supporting a particular candidate. In the case of the group that has done the most to attack Mr. Gingrich, it calls itself only Restore Our Future, never mentioning Mr. Romney's name.
''There is no name associated with putting that negative ad out there,'' Mr. Albrecht said. ''These super PACs have concealed the names of the candidates.''
Steve Duprey, a Republican strategist in New Hampshire who is not aligned with any candidate this year, said he believed voters were used to the negative ads and would not care if they saw them next week.
''I think people are so steeled to that kind of campaigning,'' Mr. Duprey, whose wife is a volunteer for Mr. Romney's campaign, said. ''The holiday spirit won't make them take umbrage at the nasty political ads.''
In an ad scheduled to begin running on Friday, Mr. Gingrich and his wife, Callista, talk about the joy of seeing homes lighted up for Christmas.
''We take it as a sign of great optimism,'' Mr. Gingrich says. ''It reminds us of the fire of freedom that burns bright in the America that we love and a prayer that the goodness of our nation will be rewarded with peace and brotherhood.''
Mr. Gingrich is clearly hoping that the voters of Iowa will reward him for trying to rise above the din of negative campaigning during the holidays. And he is betting that some voters will be turned off by candidates who respond to the good cheer with further attacks.
That worked for Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, in 2008. But at the time there were no super PACs that could run ads without being associated with a candidate.
And it may be that voters in Iowa and New Hampshire are just getting used to all this campaigning, even during the holidays.
And while Mr. Huckabee had some political baggage that his rivals tried to exploit, its volume did not compare with that of the issues Mr. Gingrich's rivals are trying to exploit now.
In the end, the ads may continue after Christmas for one very simple reason.
''They work,'' Mr. Albrecht said.

HEADLINE: House Republicans Agree To Extend Payroll Tax Cut

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Bowing under intense pressure from members of their own party, House Republican leaders agreed Thursday to accept a temporary extension of the payroll tax cut, beating a hasty retreat from a showdown that Republicans increasingly saw as a threat to their election opportunities next year.
Under a deal reached between House and Senate leaders, the House will now approve as early as Friday the two-month extension of a payroll tax holiday and unemployment benefits approved by the Senate last Saturday, and the Senate will appoint members of a House-Senate conference committee to negotiate legislation to extend both benefits through 2012.
House Republicans -- who rejected an almost identical deal on Tuesday -- collapsed under the political rubble that has accumulated over the week, much of it from their own party, worried that the blockade would do serious damage to their appeal to voters. 
The House speaker, John A. Boehner, determined to put the issue behind his party, announced the decision over the phone to members on Thursday, and did not permit the usual back and forth that is common on such calls, enraging many of them.
After his conversation with lawmakers, the speaker conceded to reporters that it might not have been ''politically the smartest thing in the world'' for House Republicans to put themselves between a tax cut and the 160 million American workers who would benefit from it, and to allow President Obama and Congressional Democrats to seize the momentum on the issue.
The agreement ended a partisan fight that threatened to keep Congress and Mr. Obama in town through Christmas and was just the latest of the bitter struggles over fiscal policy involving House conservatives, the president and the Democratic-controlled Senate.
Under the deal, the employee's share of the Social Security payroll tax will stay at the current level, 4.2 percent of wages, through Feb. 29. In the absence of Congressional action, it would revert to the usual 6.2 percent next month. The government will also continue paying unemployment insurance benefits under current policy through February. Without Congressional action, many of the long-term unemployed would begin losing benefits next month.
In addition, under the agreement, Medicare will continue paying doctors at current rates for two months, averting a 27 percent cut that would otherwise occur on Jan. 1.
The new deal makes minor adjustments to make it easier for small businesses to cope with the tax changes and prevents manipulation of an employee's pay should the tax cut extension fail to go beyond two months.
The House, which is in pro forma session, could seal the deal Friday unless a member raises an objection on the floor; the Senate would then do the same. If an objection occurs, Mr. Boehner will summon the full House back next week for a formal vote, he said.
Mr. Obama, who has reaped political benefits from the standoff, welcomed the outcome.
''This is good news, just in time for the holidays,'' he said in a statement. ''This is the right thing to do to strengthen our families, grow our economy, and create new jobs. This is real money that will make a real difference in people's lives. ''
In the end, the agreement seemed a clear victory for Mr. Obama and the Democrats -- at least for now. They managed to change the narrative from one about Mr. Obama making a concession -- he agreed to a provision in the bill to speed the approval process for an oil pipeline -- to one about stonewalling House Republicans, who have spent much of the year holding the upper hand of divided government.
Democrats have been quick to exploit the issue. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee this week unleashed automated phone calls, some of which were recorded by the Democratic strategist James Carville, in the districts of 20 targeted House Republicans.
The onslaught will continue. ''This is a defining moment,'' said the head of the committee, Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York. ''This by itself doesn't necessarily alter the political landscape, but the chronic chaos and repeated extremism will help us win back the House.''
The push to find a quick resolution was touched off Thursday by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, who had negotiated the two-month extension. After a few days of silence, he called on the House to accept a temporary continuation of the tax cut, and to extend unemployment pay, as long as Senate Democrats committed to quickly opening negotiations over a yearlong agreement.
''House Republicans sensibly want greater certainty about the duration of these provisions, while Senate Democrats want more time to negotiate the terms,'' Mr. McConnell said in a prepared statement. ''We can and should do both.''
Editorial boards from Bakersfield, Calif., to Chicago to St. Petersburg, Fla., hammered on Republicans throughout the week, and even the conservative editorial page of The Wall Street Journal piled on, setting off near panic among Republicans as they came under attack for potentially cutting the take-home pay of American workers in a struggling economy.
Just hours after Mr. McConnell released his statement Thursday, a few House freshmen began to crumble.
''I'm calling on G.O.P. leadership to immediately bring up the Senate's two-month extension for an up or down vote,'' said Representative Sean P. Duffy of Wisconsin, who voted against the deal earlier in the week.
On the Web site of Representative Rick Crawford, Republican of Arkansas, were two statements: one from Tuesday proclaiming his vote against the Senate payroll tax bill, and a new message on Thursday featuring a letter he wrote to Mr. Boehner. ''We are now in a position that requires all options to be on the table, that requires Republicans to not only demand a willingness to compromise, but to offer it as well,'' Mr. Crawford wrote.
Mr. McConnell's statement was a lifeline of sorts to House Republicans out of a conflict that many acknowledged had the capacity to harm their party in the opening days of an election year in which a president will be chosen and control of the divided Congress decided. Many Senate Republicans and other party insiders expressed deepening worry that the fight was whittling away at their chance to take back the Senate, remove Mr. Obama and even hold their majority in the House.
Soon after the McConnell statement was released, Mr. Boehner met with Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, and the eight negotiators he appointed to serve on a conference committee, telling them of his decision, according to Republican aides. His staff then presented a proposal to Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada.
The agreement is likely to be only a truce in the battle.
''I look forward to appointing members of my caucus to continue negotiations towards a year-long agreement,'' Mr. Reid said in a statement. ''Two months is not a long time, and I expect the negotiators to work expeditiously to forge yearlong extensions of these critical policies.''

HEADLINE: The House Backs Down

 BODY:
For a full year, House Republicans have replaced governing with confrontations that they allow to reach the brink of crisis, only then making extreme demands in exchange for a resolution. On Thursday, that strategy crumbled. Battered by public opinion and undermined by more reasonable Senate Republicans, the House's leaders backed down and signed off on a deal to continue the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance for two months. 
The House Republicans' stubborn opposition to the extension ''may not have been politically the smartest thing in the world,'' Speaker John Boehner said, in the understatement of the week. He still called it ''a good fight.''
If the deal goes through on Friday -- and even one angry lawmaker could stall it -- the paychecks of 160 million workers will not shrink for at least eight weeks and three million jobless workers will keep their benefits. That will be paid for largely by mortgage fees, and negotiations will resume on paying for the remaining 10 months.
A Republican demand that President Obama make a decision on the Keystone XL oil pipeline will remain in the measure, as negotiated by the Senate last week. Republicans also won some minor adjustments to prevent small businesses from being harmed by the extension.
The struggle to reach an agreement, which was a clear victory for President Obama, exposed voters in the starkest way to the real temperament of the House that Americans elected a year ago. If the president wants it, they're against it. If it might assist the middle class, as opposed to the rich, they will concoct an economic argument to oppose it. (''The payroll tax cut isn't really that effective.'') And if it absolutely has to pass, they will throw in stray ideas -- an oil pipeline, air pollution regulations -- to win some part of their agenda, or kill the bill trying.
The Republican wounds this time were entirely self-inflicted. The crisis over the two-month extension wasn't really about the payroll tax at all; it was about the hurt feelings of bumptious House members having to accede to a deal driven by the Senate and the White House. The real confrontation, over paying for the tax cut, is yet to come.
The only reason the Senate approved a two-month extension is that the two parties could not agree on how to pay for a full year. Before the House's tantrum, Democrats had proposed an income-tax surcharge on millionaires, which would have been an eminently fair trade to help the middle class and the economy, but Republicans rejected it. The Republicans wanted to cut social spending more than the deal reached earlier this year, and make health insurance exchanges more expensive to undermine health care reform. Democrats were right to balk at that.
When the next battle comes, Democrats will presumably be facing a more cohesive group of Republican negotiators. Having already given in on the millionaires' tax and the pipeline, they will have to push hard to prevent further damage to the economy. Still, this narrow victory showed the limits to Republican brinksmanship. Popular opinion was clearly on the side of the Democrats, as members heard from their constituents, and that momentum may produce a better long-term agreement.

HEADLINE: Yes, Perry Has Lured Business to Texas. But How Many Jobs Created Is in Dispute.

BYLINE: By BECCA AARONSON. 
baaronson@texastribune.org

 BODY:
As Gov. Rick Perry pushes his job creation initiatives on the presidential campaign trail, he often touts the Texas Enterprise Fund, an economic development program that the governor's office says is bringing 59,000 jobs and $14.7 billion in capital investment to Texas.
But the number of jobs his office credits the program with creating has been scrutinized by Mr. Perry's opponents, who say the fund's contributions to the Texas economy have been far overstated. And a national nonprofit has said the Enterprise Fund lacks the accountability measures to ensure it is creating quality jobs. 
Mr. Perry helped create the program in 2003 with the goal of luring new companies to Texas by providing grants. Companies undergo an 11-step ''due diligence'' process before a contract is signed, and the governor, lieutenant governor and speaker of the Texas House must all approve, said Lucy Nashed, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perry.
The contracts require companies to meet job-creation milestones each year and maintain those jobs for an extended period of time. The governor's office said companies that are subsidized through the fund created or maintained a combined 33,460 new jobs in 2010. Although 28 of the companies failed to meet their job targets, and at least four of those contracts were terminated, 25 reported a job surplus, which led to a total of 9,795 more jobs than the contracts required.
But Craig McDonald, the executive director of Texans for Public Justice, which tracks money and political influence in Texas politics, said the job growth cited by the governor's office is misleading. A report released by Mr. McDonald's group last month said that amendments to recipients' state contracts, lowering targets or postponing deadlines, ''undercut the job promises.''
While some companies whose contracts were amended were able to meet their revised targets, others still fell short. Of the 15 Enterprise Fund companies with amended contracts that filed compliance reports with the governor's office in 2010, eight did not meet their new job targets. Combined, the 15 companies fell 941 jobs short of their amended projection.
Ms. Nashed said that it was impossible to predict a business cycle and that the ability to amend contracts benefits companies and taxpayers. Under the revised contract terms, the state can ''require the company to have to maintain those jobs longer than they would have before,'' Ms. Nashed said. She also said the contracts allow the state to reclaim money if companies do not meet their obligations.
So far, companies with amended contracts have repaid $7.7 million to the state -- a little more than 11 percent of the funds disbursed -- for failing to meet job targets on time. Mr. Perry's office has also reclaimed $16 million from 11 companies whose contracts were terminated, or just over half of the funds originally disbursed to those companies.
The nonprofit Good Jobs First released a report this month comparing 238 job creation programs across the country. Although the Texas Economic Development Act, an incentive program managed by the state comptroller, received a perfect score, the Texas Enterprise Fund received low marks.
Thomas Cafcas, the report's co-author, said the Enterprise Fund lacks uniform accountability measures -- like market-based wage and health care requirements -- that would ensure the program creates quality jobs. Implementing consistent standards would also guarantee ''there are no backroom dealings that change the rules'' midcontract, Mr. Cafcas said.
Ray Perryman, a Texas economist, said incentive programs are always controversial. He said the Enterprise Fund has been largely effective at luring businesses to Texas, so it is appropriate for Mr. Perry to ''receive recognition for its success.''

HEADLINE: A Victory Considerably Aided by the Other Side

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama did not win much substantively with his victory Thursday over House Republicans in their showdown over extending payroll tax cuts and unemployment aid for two months. But he got a lot politically: a big start toward retiring the perception -- fair or not, and even among Democrats -- that in a pinch with the other party he will inevitably surrender.
That perception had dogged Mr. Obama for much of the year since gains by Republicans in the 2010 midterm elections gave them control of the House and a share of power in Washington. But it became threatening, both to Mr. Obama's leverage with Congress and to his prospects for re-election, after the epic summer fight over raising the nation's debt limit. 
In September, the White House set out to change the image of Mr. Obama from compromiser in chief to determined voice of economic populism, beginning a push for a job-creation plan that it viewed as a win-win. Either Mr. Obama would pass his plan -- which was not likely given Republican opposition both to additional stimulus measures and to the higher taxes on the wealthy that he proposed to offset the package's cost -- or he would get political credit for trying, given the popularity of the plan's individual provisions.
And he would make it clear that Republicans would obstruct anything he proposed, especially if it meant higher taxes on the rich.
What surprised the administration, and not least Mr. Obama, was how much House Republicans would contribute toward the White House's goal through their miscalculations in waging this holiday-season showdown over tax cuts for 160 million workers and assistance for several million jobless Americans.
The stand by House Republicans, which openly divided the party and put them in conflict with Senate Republicans, helped Mr. Obama perhaps as much as anything the White House and Congressional Democrats did.
Vin Weber, a Republican Party strategist and former congressman, acknowledged that Mr. Obama had won at least ''a nice tactical victory to end the year'' as well as higher approval ratings in recent polls. Mr. Weber said he learned long ago from a pollster to President Ronald Reagan that ''one of the central ingredients of a president's approval rating is the public's sense of his ability to dominate Congress.''
''The substantive issues,'' he said, ''are secondary.''
''What Republicans in the House didn't understand -- and I love these guys by and large -- but what they didn't understand is that you don't fight every issue,'' Mr. Weber added. ''And if you're going to fight an issue like this, you're going to give him a victory and hurt yourself in the process.''
As glum and divided as Republicans were at the outcome, Democrats were celebrating that Mr. Obama had stuck by the united front he forged with them this fall.
''The White House must feel pretty good about muscling home a victory for the middle class,'' said John Podesta, chairman of the liberal Center for American Progress and a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. ''And importantly for the fights of 2012, they learned those muscles work.''
Congressional Democrats have long been suspicious that Mr. Obama was too eager to cut deals with Republicans that would benefit him politically but not his party -- by reducing Medicare and Social Security spending, for example, to get a so-called grand budget bargain. But this week they freely credited him with the victory, for his persistence and his refusal in the endgame to negotiate with House Republicans.
An aide to Congressional Democratic leaders said, ''The White House just went all in and closed off the House G.O.P.'s hoped-for exit ramp''-- that is, Republicans' belief that Mr. Obama would ultimately would give in rather than risk blame if payroll taxes went up for millions on Jan. 1.
For the White House, which has long chafed at the criticism that Mr. Obama has been a soft touch for Congressional Republicans, the outcome was vindication.
Last December, liberal Democrats were outraged when Mr. Obama agreed to extend the expiring Bush-era tax cuts for the rich by an additional two years, after having campaigned to end them. The White House said that was the price to get Republicans, who were newly emboldened by their election victories, to support a one-year payroll tax cut and extended unemployment aid -- without which, the administration and many economists believed, the economy could tip into another recession.
Most galling to the White House, however, has been the lingering criticism from Democratic insiders and grass-roots supporters alike about the August debt-limit deal. In that compromise, Mr. Obama accepted deep spending cuts but Republicans blocked any tax increases.
Mr. Obama had no choice but to compromise then, his aides argued; the nation risked economic calamity if it could no longer borrow to pay its debts, and Mr. Obama's Republican adversaries professed to be willing to see that happen. Even so, administration officials said, the deal was not only better than the critics suggested but it helped set the trap that House Republicans walked into this month.
The deal increased the debt ceiling through 2012, not to this month as some Republicans had wanted, and thereby removed the threat of default from Republicans' end-of-the-year bargaining arsenal. With the stakes much lower, after August Mr. Obama was liberated to press a harder bargain. Starting in September with his jobs package, he did.
''For the first time I think you see a kind of consistency and coherency in terms of an economic message,'' Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said of Mr. Obama. ''The pivot point was the jobs speech, and the jobs speech occurred after he had dealt with the extension of the tax cuts and dealt with the debt ceiling. Those two things freed him up to do what he's been doing.''
Also a factor was the hard lesson Mr. Obama learned from his past negotiations with Speaker John A. Boehner, first in the spring talks over this year's domestic spending and then in their summer effort for the grand bargain to reduce long-term debt: Mr. Boehner cannot deliver his defiantly antigovernment and Tea Party-inspired majority in the House.
When that proved true yet again, Mr. Obama was bolstered just as Mr. Boehner was further undermined. Whether Mr. Obama continues to play a strong hand will be tested soon -- when Congress reconvenes in January to resume the fight over a full-year extension.

HEADLINE: In Europe, Juggling Image and Capital

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Stung by souring loans and troubled government bond portfolios, many European banks are being forced by regulators to raise money to build up their cash cushions against future losses.
That includes Santander, the Spanish banking giant that European regulators say has the biggest capital hole to fill: at least 15 billion euros.
So why, then, is Santander still planning to pay its shareholders 2011 dividends worth at least 2 billion euros in cash and even more in stock?
That question goes to the heart of the economic challenge that Europe faces in the year ahead. A combination of government austerity, and the imposition of bigger capital safety cushions that are leading banks to retrench, seem all but certain to plunge the Continent back into recession less than three years after emerging from the last one. 
But many banks are taking actions that will only intensify the blow. To preserve their allure as global brands, while trying to compensate for their battered share prices, big European banks like Santander remain intent on maintaining rich dividend payouts to shareholders. At the same time, they are selling assets, curbing lending and taking other belt-tightening measures to satisfy regulators' demands for more capital.
''Our dividend is a sign of our expected future profits,'' said Jose Antonio Alvarez, the chief financial officer of Santander. ''Unless our expectations change we try not to cut the dividend.''
Santander, though by many measures the most generous, is not the only bank paying dividends as it scrambles to raise capital.
Its rival, the Spanish lender BBVA, plans to pay out nearly half its profits to shareholders, despite being under regulators' orders to raise 6.3 billion euros in capital. To a lesser but still significant extent, Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas will also be paying out dividends as they try to take in money to build their capital cushions.
All this is a sharp contrast to the way capital-short banks in the United States slashed dividends to conserve cash during the depths of the financial crisis that followed the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008. The American government also injected cash into the banks, as Britain did with its weaker institutions.
So far, European governments have shown no inclination to do likewise for their banks. And critics say the contrast with the American experience shows how much European regulators are out of step, or even out of touch, with the banks they supervise -- with potentially disturbing ramifications for the European economy.
''I do not think Europeans understand the implications of a systemic banking crisis,'' said Richard Koo, the chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo and an expert on the financial stagnation in Japan in the 1990s. ''When all banks are forced to raise capital at the same time, the result is going to be even weaker banks and an even longer recession -- if not depression.''
A paper Mr. Koo wrote on the subject has gone viral on the Web, with many picking up on his recommendation that the banking crisis will not be solved until European governments inject large amounts of money into their banks.
''Government intervention should be the first resort, not the last resort,'' Mr. Koo said in an interview.
There is little doubt that European banks need shoring up right now. That fact was made clear Wednesday, when 523 banks tapped the European Central Bank for a record 489 billion euros (nearly $640 billion) in loans. Compared with their American peers, they have been much more dependent on borrowing in recent years to finance their lending binges.
On average, European banks' loan books exceed their deposits by 1.2 times. In the United States the average loan-to-deposit ratio is 0.70. The upshot is that it will probably take much longer for Europe's banks to unwind their bad loans and debt than it has for American banks.
The European Banking Authority, after a third round of stress tests in October, has ordered Europe's fragile banks to raise more than 114 billion euros in fresh cash in the next six months. By June 2012, the region's financial institutions will need to increase their so-called core Tier 1 capital ratio -- the strictest measure of a bank's ability to resist financial shocks -- to 9 percent of assets.
That ratio, higher than the 5 percent preliminary target that the Federal Reserve set for American banks this week, reflects the acute capital strains that European banks are facing.
To meet the new European standard, analysts predict that the region's banks could end up selling assets, shrinking loan books and shutting down foreign subsidiaries in a deleveraging process that may exceed 3 trillion euros in the coming years. And unless they are able to find better methods to restore their balance sheets -- including direct support from their equally stressed national governments -- many banks could well end up failing, analysts warn.
That would make it difficult for stagnating economies like Spain and Italy to recover, while potentially undermining growth in healthier places, like Eastern Europe and Latin America, where European banks are big lenders.
In many ways, Santander is better off than most of its European peers.
More diversified geographically than other banks in the euro zone, Santander so far this year has received nearly 70 percent of its profit from economies that do not use the euro currency, including Brazil, Argentina, Britain and, on a smaller scale, the United States, where it owns Sovereign Bank. In contrast to European banks like Dexia in Belgium and Commerzbank in Germany, Santander is not in need of a bailout.
Despite problems in the global financial system, analysts expect Santander to earn about 7 billion euros in profit this year, down from 8.1 billion euros in 2010.
What mainly worries European regulators is Santander's exposure to the crumbling Spanish and Portuguese economies -- which account for 34 percent of its loan book -- and the 48 billion euros in Spanish government bonds on its books.
Santander, perhaps more than any other bank in Europe, has put a special emphasis on keeping its 3.3 million shareholders content through a regular diet of dividends and a 10 percent dividend yield that is unmatched among European banks. The family of Emilio Botin, the patriarch who serves as executive chairman of Grupo Santander, controls only about 2 percent of the company's stock. So keeping the other shareholders happy is paramount.
This is especially true as speculation builds over whether Mr. Botin's daughter, Ana Patricia Botin, who now runs the British unit of the bank, will become the fourth Botin to head the institution. Bowing to criticism that it is paying out too much cash, Santander said this week that it would increase the proportion of its dividends paid as new shares rather than cash.
In the past, that approach has prompted shareholders to take as much as 85 percent of their dividends in stock. But with the stock price down about 30 percent over the last year, investors have been taking fewer than three-quarters of their dividends in such a manner. If the stock continues to decline, and market uncertainty rises, Santander could have to provide more cash for dividends.
Mr. Alvarez, the chief financial officer, conceded that the dismal performance of the local economy was forcing the bank to cut back on its Spanish exposure, with loans inside the country expected to be down 4 to 5 percent this year.
On Monday, the Bank of Spain released data showing that bad loans on the books of the nation's commercial banks, mostly in the real estate sector, had reached 7.4 percent of total lending -- the highest level since 1994. Santander's nonperforming loan ratio in Spain has increased to 5.1 percent, up from 3.4 percent in December 2009.
Even so, and despite its dividend payouts, Mr. Alvarez said that the bank would exceed the new European regulatory guidelines by achieving a 10 percent capital ratio next year -- largely by converting 7 billion euros of bonds into equity, issuing new shares and selling assets.
To date, the European Banking Authority has not ordered European banks to curb dividends to meet capital targets, suggesting that banks should clamp down on bonuses instead. But with compensation levels at euro zone banks generally not as high as their American and British peers, the savings to be made there will not be substantial.
Instead, analysts expect further retrenchment by the banks, especially as economic conditions grow worse.
''We have not seen the really stressed selling yet,'' said Tim Babich of Fortelus, a London hedge fund that invests in distressed assets throughout Europe.
Mr. Babich said that as banks find it more difficult to raise funds, they will move faster to cut down on loans and unload lagging assets. He expects that to be particularly true in Spain, where Santander and other banks sit on failed real estate loans worth hundreds of billions of euros but have been slow to recognize losses on most of them.
If everyone starts trying to sell assets and questionable loans at the same time, Mr. Babich warns, watch out. ''It could lead to a depression,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Post-Truth Campaign

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Suppose that President Obama were to say the following: ''Mitt Romney believes that corporations are people, and he believes that only corporations and the wealthy should have any rights. He wants to reduce middle-class Americans to serfs, forced to accept whatever wages corporations choose to pay, no matter how low.''
How would this statement be received? I believe, and hope, that it would be almost universally condemned, by liberals as well as conservatives. Mr. Romney did once say that corporations are people, but he didn't mean it literally; he supports policies that would be good for corporations and the wealthy and bad for the middle class, but that's a long way from saying that he wants to introduce feudalism. 
But now consider what Mr. Romney actually said on Tuesday: ''President Obama believes that government should create equal outcomes. In an entitlement society, everyone receives the same or similar rewards, regardless of education, effort, and willingness to take risk. That which is earned by some is redistributed to the others.''
And in an interview the same day, Mr. Romney declared that the president ''is going to put free enterprise on trial.''
This is every bit as bad as my imaginary Obama statement. Mr. Obama has never said anything suggesting that he holds such views, and, in fact, he goes out of his way to praise free enterprise and say that there's nothing wrong with getting rich. His actual policy proposals do involve a rise in taxes on high-income Americans, but only back to their levels of the 1990s. And no matter how much the former Massachusetts governor may deny it, the Affordable Care Act established a national health system essentially identical to the one he himself established at a state level in 2006.
Over all, Mr. Obama's positions on economic policy resemble those that moderate Republicans used to espouse. Yet Mr. Romney portrays the president as the second coming of Fidel Castro and seems confident that he will pay no price for making stuff up.
Welcome to post-truth politics.
Why does Mr. Romney think he can get away with this kind of thing? Well, he has already gotten away with a series of equally fraudulent attacks. In fact, he has based pretty much his whole campaign around a strategy of attacking Mr. Obama for doing things that the president hasn't done and believing things he doesn't believe.
For example, in October Mr. Romney pledged that as president, ''I will reverse President Obama's massive defense cuts.'' That line presumably plays well with Republican audiences, but what is he talking about? The defense budget has continued to grow steadily since Mr. Obama took office.
Then there's Mr. Romney's frequent suggestion that the president has gone around the world ''apologizing for America.'' This is a popular theme on the right -- but the so-called Obama apology tour is a complete fabrication, assembled by taking quotes out of context.
As Greg Sargent of The Washington Post has pointed out, there's a common theme to these whoppers and a number of other things Mr. Romney has said: the strategy is clearly to portray the president as a suspect character, someone who doesn't share American values. And since Mr. Obama has done and said nothing to justify this portrait, Mr. Romney just invents stuff to make his case.
But won't there be some blowback? Won't Mr. Romney pay a price for running a campaign based entirely on falsehoods? He obviously thinks not, and I'm afraid he may be right.
Oh, Mr. Romney will probably be called on some falsehoods. But, if past experience is any guide, most of the news media will feel as though their reporting must be ''balanced,'' which means that every time they point out that a Republican lied they have to match it with a comparable accusation against a Democrat -- even if what the Democrat said was actually true or, at worst, a minor misstatement.
This isn't an abstract speculation. Politifact, the project that is supposed to enforce truth in politics, has declared Democratic claims that Republicans voted to end Medicare its ''Lie of the Year.'' It did so even though Republicans did indeed vote to dismantle Medicare as we know it and replace it with a voucher scheme that would still be called ''Medicare,'' but would look nothing like the current program -- and would no longer guarantee affordable care.
So here's my forecast for next year: If Mr. Romney is in fact the Republican presidential nominee, he will make wildly false claims about Mr. Obama and, occasionally, get some flack for doing so. But news organizations will compensate by treating it as a comparable offense when, say, the president misstates the income share of the top 1 percent by a percentage point or two.
The end result will be no real penalty for running an utterly fraudulent campaign. As I said, welcome to post-truth politics.

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
In Turkey, Western Companies Find Stability and Growth | Turkey's split personality has often left it caught between two worlds. Some European nations have vocally opposed the country's attempts to build closer ties with the West. And many of its Middle Eastern neighbors have been wary of the avidly secular state.
Now, the country's identity is an advantage for deal makers. Turkey doesn't have the economic baggage of its European neighbors, which are dealing with the sovereign debt crisis. With a relatively stable government, it has also angled for a more prominent role in the Middle East, as countries like Syria and Libya continue to face turmoil.
The combination of economic growth and political stability has attracted cash-rich companies looking to make acquisitions. So far this year, deal volume has totaled $10.6 billion, ahead of European countries like Austria, Portugal and the Czech Republic. In 2010, mergers and acquisitions reached $25.6 billion, up from $1.1 billion a decade ago.

HEADLINE: Once Lofty Owl Creek Falls 13%

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: Owl Creek Asset Management, the hedge fund founded by Jeffrey Altman that survived the financial crisis relatively unscathed, is now suffering, with the flagship portfolio off 13 percent through November. 

 BODY:
Jeffrey Altman, the wealthy founder of Owl Creek Asset Management, belongs to an elite circle of hedge fund managers who survived the financial crisis relatively unscathed. As he told investors in 2008, "We feel very fortunate to have dodged a significant number of bullets, landmines and other incendiary devices during this dramatic year."
Now, Mr. Altman's fortunes have changed. 
His flagship fund is down roughly 13 percent through November, compared with a roughly flat S.&P. 500-stock index. Assets have fallen from roughly $6.5 billion to start the year, to just about $5 billion. 
In his third-quarter letter this year, Mr. Altman begins with the bad news, itemizing the 10 positions "that hurt us most in the quarter." 
Navistar International and Dana Holdings, two industrial trucking parts companies, accounted for a nearly $200 million of losses. Cigna took a nearly $80 million bite out of the portfolio, as the health care insurer "sold off following the debt ceiling debate," according to the letter. Mr. Altman also highlighted the firm's debt holdings in the bankrupt Washington Mutual, which have been hurt by the ongoing proceedings. 
"We are disappointed by recent performance," he said in the third-quarter letter, released this month. "The markets have been very unfriendly to investors, with extreme volatility due to significant macroeconomic headwinds that have extremely binary outcomes."
Owl Creek did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
A number of value-oriented funds have been battered in the current environment. Industry stars like Lee Ainslee of Maverick Capital have watched returns sink as the market ignores fundamentals and jostles stocks in unison. 
More broadly, hedge funds have disappointed investors in 2011, trailing the S.&P. 500, which is roughly flat on the year. Through November, hedge funds across all strategies are down more than 4 percent, according to Hedge Fund Research. 
Mr. Altman's fund has had a stellar track record since starting in 2002, besting the markets by a wide margin pretty much every year except 2005. In 2007, Mr. Altman rose to prominence by being named one of the highest paid hedge fund managers of the year after his fund soared nearly 40 percent, earning him about $100 million personally. In 2008, it lost just 9 percent while the S.&P. 500 was off almost 37 percent.
The firm was founded with a value-investing strategy, which prizes stocks thought to be underpriced by the marketplace and thrives on in-depth research of companies. The firm also dabbles in the so-called event-driven space, where investments are made in anticipation of trigger that will bolster the stock price.
Mr. Altman, a 1988 graduate of Tulane University, is the head portfolio manager at Owl Creek. Prior to starting the hedge fund in 2001, Mr. Altman was a portfolio manager for Franklin Mutual Advisers.

HEADLINE: New Frontiers in Economic Barbarism

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Forgetting not just Keynes but Friedman too. 

 BODY:
I've written quite a lot about the way much of the macroeconomics community has descended into a Dark Age, forgetting the things they used to know. I was originally set off by the way some economists were propounding Say's Law -- the idea, refuted 75 years ago, that all income must be spent and hence that supply creates its own demand -- as a profound insight, somehow missed by three generations of economists. 
Well, new forms of acquired ignorance keep surfacing. 
Matthew Yglesias finds John Cochrane ridiculing the notion that devaluation makes it easier to bring a country's relative wages down, whereas the empirical evidence is overwhelming that devaluation does, in fact, do just that. 
Now, Yglesias has some fun with Cochrane's violation of the extended version of Godwin's Law, which says that the first person to mention either Weimar or Zimbabwe in a discussion of current issues loses. But Matt's main point is that there are very good reasons why changing relative currency values is a lot easier than changing the whole structure of nominal wages and prices:
Depreciation makes vacations in Spain cheap, it makes Spanish exports cheap, and it makes it attractive for rich foreigners to actually go buy up excess Spanish housing stock to use as vacation homes and such. Everyone's taken a hit, but they're back on the path to growth.
The other alternative -- the road we're actually traveling down -- is one in which all of these adjustments need to happen piecemeal. To make the same adjustment happen, every single contract in the country needs to be piecemeal renegotiated. That's every town budget, every cell phone plan, every commercial lease, every salary, etc. It's not "impossible" but it's a logistical and political nightmare. And it takes time. During that time instead of everyone working harder because they're poorer and more indebted than they realized and need to raise their incomes what happens is that 10-20 percent of the population does nothing because they can't find jobs. 
Quite. What Matt may not know, however, is that this is a classic argument in international macro, and the person who made it best was .... drumroll ... Milton Friedman. Here's a snip from Friedman's 1953 essay "The case for flexible exchange rates":
Is it really possible that people at the University of Chicago have unlearned not only Keynes but Friedman? Alas, yes.

HEADLINE: Deck the Halls With Boughs of Nutty

BYLINE: DICK CAVETT


HIGHLIGHT: Looking, not always successfully, for some balm amid the season's annoyances. 

 BODY:
You may see this as a companion to my last year's bittersweet Christmas entry. Some found that one a bit too poignant.
I envy, in a way, those who continue right through adulthood to just love Christmas - the way we did as kids, beaming at the thought of festooning the tree with tinsel, hanging the capacious stocking (faintly redolent of mothballs) and hoping Santa had gotten all our hints and, if you're old enough, cursing those damned strings of lights on the tree where if one burned out they all went out and you had to seek, one by one, the dead culprit. (How easy we have it today.) 
In my case, some affection for the hallowed time has returned markedly, after at least 20 Christmases spent on Virgin Gorda, British Virgin Islands, happily far from the familiar list of horrors that are part and parcel of Noel in Gotham, my favorite city. 
To call New York's traffic at holiday time a nightmare is to understate. And, incidentally, was the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center dreamed up by a sadist? The presence of that bloody conifer helps achieve gridlock for acres in every direction. That lovely, unoffending tree, from its peaceful forest life untimely plucked.
"Dumbos from New Jersey," as a cop once told me, seem to think they can pile the family into the car, drive right up beside the big spruce and pull off a few souvenir needles - learning the hard way that it's probably easier to edge the car up to the White House and tap on the occupants' windows. So, while disappointed kiddies squall, the parents discover they're lucky to find a parking place from which they can't actually see their house. As for the sidewalk mobs of loutish, pushy shoppers, these offer the less-than-jolly dangers of pickpockets, transmitted flu and the possibility of a rib-cracking crush.
I have, by way of contrast, lovely memories of many standard Midwestern Christmases in Nebraska, with happy families and jovial visitors and strung popcorn and peanut brittle and snoozing dogs by the hearth. You felt warm and protected, surrounded at a full dining room table by relatives who, before dessert, swore they'd begin their diets the next day and who stayed on for Canasta or Monopoly.
One salty memory comes back. Every year, my German grandmother insisted that my father place prominently on the tree a faded and ancient glass ornament from her earliest childhood memories in "the old country." It must have belonged to generations of the Pinsch (her family name) clan since before Germany began starting wars.

It was a delicate and remarkably unattractive twisted glass cornucopia, about five inches long. At its lower end, the opening of this horn of plenty, the partially faded colors of its fruits and vegetables were still fairly bright. One year, my dad seized the thing and barked, "Do we have to look at this damn thing every year?" Startled, "Grossmom" asked why he would say such a thing about her beloved treasure.
"Because it's ugly. It looks like a goose with a bouquet in its fanny."
(Exit Grossmom in tears.)
Many years pass. Through an odd set of circumstances including sudden unemployment as a writer in Hollywood, owing to the cancellation by ABC of the imploded "The Jerry Lewis Show" of 1962 - a television mishap sometimes accidentally misfiled in archives between the Hindenburg catastrophe and the Titanic's descent from view - I found myself, with five other people, the only passengers on a full-size airliner on Christmas day - the best day to fly. We were bound from that less significant coast to this one. Where New York is.
I was yet a bachelor and, still freshly a New Yorker, living solo in the city of my dreams, partaking hungrily of all the advantages from cultural to carnal thereto. (The former outran the latter, by a mile.)
My Christmas feast that year: a lone, late lunch at the Automat.
Here's the setting: I was closely flanked, at tables left and right, by two diners, each unaware of the other. 
To my left, a lumpish geek, munching and dribbling. Don't ask me why I imagined his first name to be either "Gort" or "Lunk." I went with "Lunk." His grubby costume was topped - as it so often is in such cases - by the thick, droopy ear flap cap favored by the lumpish gentry. His teeth? Grounds for a dental hygienist to switch careers.
His counterpart, the female of the species, resembling in face and costume one of the trio of "weyard sisters" who perform the opening number - "Double, double toil and trouble" - in a traditional production of "Macbeth." I dubbed her "Gravel Gertie." Her costume featured mismatched galoshes.
Near each other, but at adjoining tables, they were in their own individual worlds.
I was able to hear them both - mantra-like mumblings with similar but separate themes. Both stared into the middle distance. The day's subject: an analysis of the city's troubles. Brief samples will do.
Lunk: "It's the hook-noses that's to blame. The hook-noses got all the money. The mayor's a prize one if I ever seen one." (He was referring to Robert Ferdinand Wagner. Of the R.C. Church.) 
G. Gertie: "It's the black ones causin' all the trouble. Look at that one over there. Look how they eat with their hands." 
I looked and saw a nattily-attired gent, dining solo. He was consuming not a hand-held slab of zebra meat, as her words might have suggested, but instead - and she was right about the manual part - a small cinnamon roll. 
Both now lowered their volume and for a time proceeded to issue, in unison, a kind of unseasonal contrapuntal chant, from which assorted, varied and creative ethnic slurs emerged like grace-notes.
Arising to go, I got their attention and, to the amusement of some people at a nearby table, uttered what seemed an appropriate question.
"Why don't you two get married?"
They blinked opaquely, and I bade adieu to Christmas at the Automat and stepped out onto Lexington Avenue. A pretty snow had begun to fall, and because of it, a sweet thing happened.
The sublime final paragraph of James Joyce's "The Dead" began to play in my head - the bits I could remember - about the snow that "was general all over Ireland ... softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves falling faintly through the universe upon all the living and the dead."
Healing snow. 
I pictured the pair, after they had ceased to dine, and wiped their mouths - or failed to - heading for their respective lairs. That gentle snow would, without prejudice, descend on Lunk and Gertie. Softly and silently, in the season of brotherly love.

HIGHLIGHT: A look at the final Weekend Business podcast, and a listen. 

 BODY:
The subprime mortgage crisis dominated the Weekend Business podcast when it started in 2007.
This is the podcast's last waltz. We're ending this series of weekly podcasts much as we started -- with Gretchen Morgenson's coverage of that crisis and its continuing consequences for homeowners, banks, the broader financial system and the overall economy. She covers this subject in her column in Sunday Business.
I also talked with Floyd Norris about the crisis in the euro zone. The European Central Bank has begun offering large-scale low-cost loans to European banks, easing the severity of their short-term liquidity problems. That may give leaders of the European Union some breathing room as they grapple with the fiscal and governance issues that threaten the Continent.
The euro crisis is likely to spill over to banks in the United States in the months ahead, in the view of Tyler Cowen, the George Mason economist, with whom I chatted in a third conversation on the podcast.
While American financial regulations are not yet adequate for the trials ahead, he says, the Federal Reserve has required financial institutions to maintain enormous reserves at the central bank. This is likely to provide an important buffer in 2012, he writes in the Economic View column in Sunday Business.
You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Gretchen Morgenson (31:10); Floyd Norris (17:33); Tyler Cowen (7:51).
As articles discussed in the podcast are published, links will be added to this post.

HEADLINE: Paying for the Payroll Tax Cut

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: By pairing stimulus and spending cuts, lawmakers give with one hand and take away with another. 

 BODY:
So House Republicans have decided to go along with a two-month extension of the payroll tax cut.
In today's weak economy, the payroll tax cut is a good way to support demand--and to avoid angering some 160 million Americans who rely on the cut to boost their take-home pay. The deal is also a gift to reporters, who were running out of poker metaphors to describe the standoff between the House and the Senate.
But there is less here than meets the eye. Teresa Tritch, who covers the economy for the editorial board, had this to say:
In a rational world, stimulus -- whether in the form of government spending or tax cuts -- would be deficit financed, rather than "paid for" with offsetting spending cuts. That's because the whole point of stimulus is to juice the economy and spending cuts, by definition, remove juice from the economy. By pairing stimulus and spending cuts, lawmakers give with one hand and take away with another.
The payroll tax cut is paid for by an increase in the guarantee fee on new loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government run mortgage companies.
In general, it's a bad idea to conflate paying for tax cuts with changes to Fannie, Freddie and broader mortgage finance system. Is this a back door way to force changes in the mortgage finance system?
More specifically, the new fees will likely be passed on to homeowners, precisely when the Obama administration is trying to make refinancing easier for struggling homeowners. If you want to encourage an activity, the last thing you want to do is make it more expensive.
It's true that paying for the payroll tax cut by raising refi fees is better than, say, kicking poor children out of Head Start. Then again, why should hard-pressed homeowners subsidize the payroll tax cut?
In fact, if lawmakers insist on paying for stimulus measures, the best way to do so is to increase taxes on the rich. That's because the rich have more money than they can spend, so taxing them more does not translate into a dollar for dollar hit to consumer spending.

HEADLINE: For Romney, a New Phase of the Campaign

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: After spending most of this year sticking to his message on the economy, Mitt Romney enters a new phase of his presidential campaign during which he can no longer be the remote front-runner. 

 BODY:
"We're going to call this 'Hair Force One,'" Ann Romney said, eyeing her husband's impeccably coiffed black hair and teasing: "In honor of you."
Last week, the Romney campaign rolled out a campaign plane for the first time, to fly the candidate, his staff and the press from Sioux City, Iowa, to Greenville, S.C. And in those enforced close quarters, reporters got glimpses of a relaxed, thoughtful and self-deprecating version of the candidate - a side of Mr. Romney that his aides frequently talk about but that the press rarely sees.
Mr. Romney spent most of this year avoiding any kind of spontaneity, showing an almost-robotic discipline to his message about jobs and President Obama's economic failures. He did few sit-down interviews, offered only limited opportunities for reporters question him on the campaign trail and generally kept the prying eyes of the press as far away as possible.
But his campaign has now entered into a new phase. On a logistical level, it now involves more chartered planes and bus trips, with a bigger pack of reporters in tow. And on a political level, he is no longer the remote front-runner, but instead, as his campaign would put it, a fighter seeking to prove he can "Earn It," as his new slogan puts it - a status that demands more interviews and more interaction in general with the media types he once kept at a safe distance.
So now there is a new dynamic: a traveling press corps not quite used to the access it is getting, and a candidate determined to come across a more likable and human. 
As he boarded that first flight from Iowa to South Carolina, the journalists raised their iPhones and BlackBerrys, snapping pictures and shooting video.
"Look at the cameras," Mr. Romney marveled, flashes popping as he hoisted his luggage into the overhead compartment. "Get a life, you guys."
Moments later, miming the duties of a flight attendant, Mr. Romney ribbed the Washington Post's Phil Rucker: "Mr. Rucker, can I get you something, sir? Some water?" he asked.
The planes, trains and automobiles aspect of campaigns at this stage takes on an outsized role in the minds of everyone along for the ride. For those curious, the press bus is still accepting nickname suggestions, despite some early attempts at a moniker - "The RomBus," for instance, or NBC's Garrett Haake's noble-but-failed push for "The Rambler," an allusion to a car produced by Mr. Romney's father, the one-time chief executive of American Motors.
But the travel logistics can also say something important about a campaign.
Last week, when Newt Gingrich was returning to Washington, D.C., aboard a commercial flight to watch his wife play the French horn in a holiday concert, Mr. Romney had the money, manpower and might to charter a plane to South Carolina to pick up one of his party's most coveted endorsements, from Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina.
And when Mr. Romney began a three-day, multistop bus tour through hard-to-reach parts of northern New Hampshire this week, his message was clear: he had the desire, not to mention the organization, to reach voters in even the tiniest, out-of-the-way towns.
Along the way, a dance plays out between candidate and media, sometimes self-consciously. The press wants a glimpse of the "real" candidate, a way to take readers and viewers behind the curtain. The candidate and his team, fully aware of the opportunity, attempt, sometimes awkwardly, to exploit that desire.
As the plane boarded for its final stop one night, he appeared holding plastic bags full of food from Hardee's, a fast food chain. "Hamburgers and turkey-burgers!" he said, tossing them out like baseballs.
The group was headed to Charleston, S.C. - a city known for its fantastic food - but everyone dutifully took a burger.
Second only to travel logistics among the day-to-day concerns of anyone on the campaign trail is food. Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann - parents to five grown sons, and grandparents to 16 children - seem at least vaguely concerned with making sure everyone is, in Mr. Romney's words, fed and watered.
As Mr. Romney ordered a Hawaiian pizza, with olives, at a campaign stop, Mrs. Romney turned to an aide and asked if she should order some pies to go for the press corps. When the aide said no, that he had already taken care of it, Mrs. Romney explained, "See, I'm a mom. I think about people having to eat."
The next day, at another event, she began instructing reporters to eat the cups of fresh fruit salad that the store had put out for visitors.
"Grab a fruit, grab a fruit," she urged. "It's healthy. You've got to be healthy." 
But the close proximity also allows for real, if typically brief, flashes of insight. Earlier on the plane, Mark Halperin of Time had playfully teased Mr. Romney, pulling up on his iPad a video of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas speaking at an event. Look how handsome he is, Mr. Halperin noted. He used to be a rancher. Did you know he used to be a rancher?
Mr. Romney laughed, and without missing a beat, Mrs. Romney raised her eyebrows and smiled: he might be a rancher again soon enough, she said.

HEADLINE: For Payroll Tax Cut, Next Step Is Obama's Signature

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: In under an hour Friday, the House and Senate dispensed with weeks of partisan bickering, passing a bill to ensure a two-month extension of a payroll tax holiday and unemployment benefits for millions of Americans. 

 BODY:
In under an hour on Friday, the House and Senate dispensed with weeks of partisan bickering, passing a bill to ensure a two-month extension of a payroll tax holiday and unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.
The fight over how and whether to pass an extension was settled Thursday afternoon, when House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio agreed - against the will of many of the chamber's most conservative members - to a Senate bill to extend the benefits for two months while a longer deal was hammered out.
The legislative day began at 9:30 on Friday, when Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, addressed the presiding officer, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, who was decked out in his Christmas tie. Mr. Reid asked for unanimous consent to extend the payroll tax, unemployment benefits and to maintain the fee levels for doctors who accept Medicare. The bill also called for Democrats to appoint conferees to a bicameral committee to come up with a longer-term measure, a request from the House Republicans.
Without objection, it was so ordered, and, a minute after Mr. Reid began speaking, the gavel was down and the Senate - void of the other 98 Senators - recessed for the day. The Senate will still be in pro forma sessions through Jan. 23, when it resumes regular business. 
The action next moved to the House, where Mr. Boehner, in a rare pro forma appearance in the chair, presided over the passage of the bill in his chamber, after a prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance, a roughly five-minute process.
For Mr. Reid, addressing his empty chamber was a bit of a victory lap, one he completed moments later in a news conference. 
"I hope this Congress has had a very good learning experience," Mr. Reid said. "Especially for those members who are newer to this body."
For Mr. Boehner, who has suffered through weeks of trying to get his conference on board with a compromise, presiding over his chamber was almost the opposite exercise. He played the role of calling for objections - there were none, even though a Republican or two dotted the chamber - on a bill many of his members dislike but did not fly back from their states to protest, sparing a junior member of the task.
As beaming Democrats like Representatives Chris Van Hollen and Steny H. Hoyer, both of Maryland, looked on from behind a microphone stand on the Democratic side of the House and Republicans staffers glowered from the chairs in the chamber, Mr. Boehner recessed the chamber for the day.
Mr. Reid later announced his appointees to the conference committee: Senator Max Baucus of Montana, who is chairman of the Senate finance committee; Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island; Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland and Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania.
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, also named her appointees: Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan; Mr. Van Hollen; Representative Xavier Becerra and Representative Henry A. Waxman both of California and Allyson Y. Schwartz of Pennsylvania.
The conferees are expected to begin meeting during the winter break.

HEADLINE: Romney Finds a New Sparring Partner in Biden

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. enters the fray of the Republican race, and Mitt Romney hits back. 

 BODY:
TILTON, N.H. - Speaking at a diner Friday morning, Mitt Romney said he had woken up to a surprise - and not just the White Christmas snow blanketing parts of northern New Hampshire. 
"Someone had written an op-ed in The Des Moines Register attacking me and blaming me for the economy," Mr. Romney said. "I thought, 'Now who would have the chutzpah - there you go - or the delusion to imagine that I was responsible for the decline of this economy over the last three years?'" And it was none other than Vice President Joe Biden."
In that article, Mr. Biden said that Mr. Romney had "misleadingly" accused the White House of creating an "entitlement society," and he criticized Mr. Romney's plans for turning around the economy.
"Romney appears satisfied to settle for an economy in which fewer people succeed, while the majority of Americans are left to tread water or fall behind. His proposal would actually double down on the policies that caused the greatest economic calamity since the Great Depression and accelerated a decades-long assault on the middle class," Mr. Biden wrote.
As Mr. Romney began criticizing Mr. Biden's op-ed, a voter called out, "Another gaffe."
"Another gaffe, exactly right," Mr. Romney said. "And you wonder in some respects what fantasy land he lives in. He needs to get out and meet with people. He seems to think that he and the president have made things better. They haven't made things better."
Mr. Romney, however, has staked his campaign on his ability to turn around the economy, and when asked at a news conference how he would continue to position himself now that the economy is showing at least some signs of improvement, Mr. Romney brushed the question away, saying that a downturn is always followed by a period of growth. 
"That is the nature of recession and recovery," Mr. Romney said. "There will, of course, be a recovery. The question is: Has this recovery been as speedy as it should have been, number one? Number two, have the policies of the president helped or hurt? And number three, has the president been willing to take on the looming challenges we face to make sure that we have a bright future?"
Answering his own questions, Mr. Romney continued: "We have not had a president who got this economy going again as he should have. His stimulus was poorly crafted, his legislative initiatives made it harder for the economy to reboot and the actions he has failed to take right now make it more difficult for the America of the future."
Reporters also asked Mr. Romney if he'd like to see a break from negative campaign advertising over the Christmas holiday.
"I hope all ads come down over the Christmas weekend, all right?" he said. "It's probably a time when people want to watch some football, or watch some old movies."

HEADLINE: Job No. 2: Wrapping Up Stimulus

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama appointed Kathleen S. Tighe, a veteran inspector general, to lead the board with oversight over the $787 stimulus program. 

 BODY:
President Obama has appointed a new leader of the board overseeing the winding down of the federal government's $787 billion stimulus program, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced Friday.
The vice president said Kathleen S. Tighe would replace Earl E. Devaney at the helm of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, which oversees how funds from the 2009 stimulus program are spent. Ms. Tighe, the inspector general for the Department of Education, will keep her current job when she assumes the new role in January.
"I'm confident that Kathleen Tighe will continue to hold the board to high standards set by Earl as the Recovery Act's top watchdog," Mr. Biden said in a statement.
Mr. Devaney, who also serves as the inspector general for the Department of Interior, announced this summer that he was retiring at the end of the year after working for more than four decades in the federal government. He is stepping down from that job as well as his post as the chairman of the Government Accountability and Transparency Board, which the president created in June to oversee federal spending more broadly.
Ms. Tighe, a former trial lawyer for the Justice Department, has spent 20 years in the federal government and is a member of the Government Accountability and Transparency Board. She was the deputy inspector general in the Department of Agriculture before taking her current job last year in the Department of Education. From 1995 to 2005, she was the counsel to the inspector general of the General Services Administration.
The recovery board first met in March 2009, and since then most of the stimulus funds have been spent. The panel is expected to wrap up its work by Sept. 30, 2013.
Over the next 21 months, Ms. Tighe will oversee the panel's dual missions to root out fraud, waste and abuse and to give Americans greater access to information about how the money is being spent, primarily through Recovery.gov and FederalReporting.gov. She will also oversee the expansion of the recovery board's data collection methods and transparency measures more broadly across federal spending.

HEADLINE: The Wyden-Ryan Plan: Dj Vu All Over Again

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The much-discussed Wyden-Ryan plan offers no new vision for containing health-care costs and relies on unproven hyptheses, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
After wrestling for decades and in futility with the triple problems facing health care in the United States - unsustainable spending growth, lack of timely access to health care for millions of uninsured Americans and highly varied quality of care - any new proposal to address these problems is likely to be a recycled old idea. 
The widely discussed new proposal from Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, to restructure the federal Medicare program for the elderly is no exception. 
The idea - generally known as "managed competition" - goes as far back as 1971, when Dr. Paul Ellwood and his colleagues at the Health Services Research Center of the American Rehabilitation Foundation injected it into President Nixon's attempt at health reform. 
Since then, the idea has appeared and reappeared in health reform in many variants and with different names, too numerous to permit a full listing here. Its most sophisticated renderings can be found in the extensive writings on the concept by the Stanford economist Alain Enthoven.

To describe the unifying theme running through these past variants, it is helpful to enumerate the major economic functions any health system must perform:

        
 Producing health-care goods and services.
        
 Financing health care, which involves extracting money from households (which ultimately pay for all of health care) and funneling it to the producers of health care, usually through the books of private or public health insurers.
        
 Risk pooling by private or public insurers to protect individuals from the financial inroads of high medical bills through insurance policies.
        
 In most modern societies, assuring that every member of society has timely access to a defined set of health-care benefits.
        
 Purchasing medical treatments from the producers of health care, which includes determining the prices to be paid, claims processing for insured patients and controlling overall spending and the quality of that care with various forms of controls lumped together under the generic label "managed care."
        
 Regulating the behavior of the various participants in the system to preserve the integrity of health care markets and the safety of health-care products and services.
Most of the debate over health policy in this country has been over two questions. 
First, to what extent should healthier or wealthier members of society be asked to subsidize the health care received by their poorer or sicker fellow Americans? Second, influenced by the answer to the first question, who should perform the functions listed above: government, private nonprofit entities or for-profit entities?
The Wyden-Ryan plan and similar precursors answer these questions as follows:

        
Let government perform the second, third, fourth and sixth functions listed above (financing, risk pooling, assuring access to care, and regulating) but delegate the first and fourth functions (producing health care and "managing" its purchase) to the private for-profit or nonprofit sectors.
        
 Let there be a limit to the extent to which healthier or wealthier Americans are forced to subsidize the health care received by sicker or poorer Americans - that is, to the practice of social solidarity.
Together, these two responses may be called "truncated social health insurance." The chart below illustrates it. Here an individual or a family is offered a choice between two health plans. In practice, such a menu could include many more competing plans.
Managed competition schemes, the Wyden-Ryan plan included, are typically operated through health-insurance exchanges of the sort provided in the Affordable Care Act. Rival health plans, which may or may not include a government-run plan, compete on this exchange under strict regulation of their behavior. 
Each insurer must quote on the exchange the total premium it will charge for an assumed standard mix of actuarial risks and for a standard, defined package of health care benefits, as well as the portion of the total premium to be paid by the prospective insured. 
Typically in these schemes, insurers cannot base their premiums on the health status and gender of the individual applicant and perhaps not even on age. 
If government provides the defined contribution, as under the Wyden-Ryan plan, the health plan chosen by the insured will be sent by the government a premium contribution. In most designs, the contribution is adjusted for the actuarial risk the applicant represents, as best that can be done prospectively. It may also be means-tested, that is, tailored to the insured's income.
There may also be ex-post risk adjustment, if, after the enrollment season, some some plans end up with risk that is more costly than average and other plans end up with lower-cost risk pools.
The major point of contention in the political debate over managed competition is not over these design parameters. Rather, it is over the nature of the "defined contribution," which defines the extent to which the concept achieves social solidarity in health care. The crucial distinction here is between "vouchers" and "premium support" (as explained in Section B of this Brookings Institution document).
In a "voucher" system, the level and future time path of the defined contribution is set independently of the time path of the cost of health care per capita. If health care cost per capita in general rises faster over time than does the indexed voucher, the system naturally shifts more and more of health care costs onto the insured. That may be its chief objective.
The plan proposed earlier this year by Representative Ryan and passed by the House of Representatives on April 15 as part of its budget plan is a voucher scheme in this sense. In that plan, Medicare's contribution to the private insurance purchased by Medicare beneficiaries was to be indexed to the Consumer Price Index, which historically has risen less rapidly than has health spending per capita. 
The Wyden-Ryan plan is also a voucher scheme, because what it calls the "defined contribution" by Medicare is limited to the growth of gross domestic product plus 1 percent, adjusted for general price inflation. Historically, general health spending and Medicare spending per capita have risen at higher growth rates.
Alternatively, the defined contribution could be styled as a "premium support" payment whose time path is indexed to the growth in average health spending per capita (in the case of Medicare, per Medicare beneficiary) in a region. 
The defined contribution in the Federal Employee Health Benefit plan enjoyed by members of Congress and federal employees is of this nature, as was the "premium support" in a plan proposed in 1995 specifically for Medicare by the Brookings Institution economist Henry Aaron and , then director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the Urban Institute. 
Genuine premium-support models are designed to protect Medicare beneficiaries better against rapidly rising health care costs in general than would most voucher plans indexed to magnitudes that grow less rapidly than does health spending.
By the design of the defined contribution, the Wyden-Ryan voucher plan would be able to constrain the growth of taxpayer financing for Medicare, simply by shifting the risk of rapid health-care cost increases from taxpayers into the household budgets of the elderly. 
As I noted in several earlier posts, the hypothesis that managed competition among private health plans can better control the overall health spending per Medicare beneficiary than would traditional Medicare lacks empirical support. It certainly has not worked that way in employment-based health insurance.
That hypothesis remains purely a belief.

HEADLINE: Broadway Hits Gold In Buffalo

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
BUFFALO -- ''The Addams Family'' musical will close on Broadway next Saturday without earning back its $16.5 million capitalization during its 22-month run, a disappointment to the producers. Yet the national tour production of ''The Addams Family'' was a hit this month at Shea's Performing Arts Center in Buffalo, grossing $995,000 in a week, more than most shows pull in on Broadway -- including ''The Addams Family,'' which hasn't earned that much money in a week since April.
Only 20 to 30 percent of Broadway shows ever turn a profit, but even the flops -- and certainly blockbusters like ''Wicked'' and ''The Lion King'' -- can make millions on the road. And few cities, it turns out, are as profitable as Buffalo, chiefly because of the huge and loyal base of subscribers at Shea's, an 85-year-old, 3,000-seat theater designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany that sits like a monument on the city's Main Street. 
The profits here are so great that one actor at the ''Addams Family'' cast party offered a toast to (in theater lingo) the ''overages.'' The morning after, the two men most responsible for bringing Broadway to Buffalo -- Albert Nocciolino, upstate New York 's most powerful tour presenter, and Anthony Conte, the president of Shea's -- were still laughing about the tribute.
''I bet we end up having one of the highest profit margins on the 'Addams Family' tour,'' Mr. Nocciolino said between bites of an omelet breakfast. ''We certainly have with several other tours.''
Buffalo has emerged as a major bellwether in commercial theater, which while centered on Broadway relies heavily on tours, which now gross more than $1 billion a year, or at least as much as Broadway itself.
Like theaters in Cleveland and Sacramento, Shea's in Buffalo has become important because of its reliable subscribers -- 13,100 for each of its six one-week Broadway tours this year. An impressive 85 percent renew annually; the subscriber base insures that 55 percent of seats are bought even before tickets go on general sale.
''The industry has noticed how good it is to play Buffalo,'' said Stuart Oken, a lead producer of ''The Addams Family,'' who pointed out that the show made more money per performance here than in Toronto, Miami or any other city since the tour began in September. He predicted that the tour would make a profit because of moneymakers like Buffalo and return some of the money lost on Broadway to investors.
Jeffrey Seller, a Tony Award-winning producer whose musicals ''Rent,'' ''Avenue Q'' and ''In the Heights'' all played Shea's, described the theater as a ''miracle of the Rust Belt,'' given that the Buffalo economy has struggled mightily through both good times and bad.
''I've come to covet a subscription slot in Buffalo because I know we're in profit before they have begun selling single tickets,'' Mr. Seller said.
Nowhere have so-called road presenters like Mr. Nocciolino and Mr. Conte become more visible tastemakers than during the Tony Awards competition each May and June. About 15 percent of Tony voters are from ''the road,'' and they are courted heavily by nominees and producers during parties in New York each spring. In recent voting for the best-musical Tony, which is the one award seen as influencing ticket sales, some theater executives believe that votes from road presenters helped ''Billy Elliot'' prevail over ''Next to Normal'' in 2009, and ''Memphis'' over ''Fela'' in 2010, because the two winners were likely to have big tours -- and a best-musical Tony is seen as helping sell tickets on the road.
Several of these road presenters said in interviews that touring potential was a factor in their Tony votes, but noted that they voted chiefly on artistic merit.
''I'm a human being, so to say how a show would play in Cleveland is not a factor in Tony voting would not be true,'' said Gina Vernaci, vice president of theatricals at Cleveland PlayhouseSquare, another prime destination for tours. ''But Cleveland wants quality shows, artistically compelling shows, enjoyable shows, as much as New Yorkers.''
Mr. Conte, a former banker in Buffalo and Shea's board member who became president of the theater in 2000, recalled admiring the Broadway show ''Spring Awakening'' but voted for ''Mary Poppins'' instead for best musical that year. He said ''the tough love story,'' flashes of nudity, and dark themes of ''Spring Awakening'' were ''not my thing,'' and he also did not envision the show as appealing to his subscribers. ''Spring Awakening'' went on to win the Tony for best musical; the show's national tour had a brief run at the University at Buffalo, but not at Shea's.
''We know our territory here,'' Mr. Conte said. ''We know that the audience is on the conservative side. When I vote on the Tonys and book shows, I'm representing my audience.''
After years as a movie palace, Shea's was nearly torn down in the 1970s because of its owner's business problems, but squatters occupied the theater and refused to leave. Now, with more than 250 performances each year, the theater stands as a majestic example of Spanish and French Baroque design as well as one of the busiest centers of life in a downtown dotted with vacant storefronts.
Even as many commercial and nonprofit theaters are struggling to hold onto subscribers, Shea's has had a large and stable base for several years, explained by both demographic and cultural reasons.
Buffalo has long had a ''season ticket'' mentality to muddle through the cold months: just as people are used to buying season tickets for the Bills and the Sabres, the city's football and hockey teams, they are open to buying season subscriptions for Broadway tours, Mr. Nocciolino said. The city (and Cleveland as well) is full of descendants of Eastern European immigrants, who, theater executives in the two cities believe, came from backgrounds where theater was appreciated.
Being near New York City means subscribers already know the Broadway brand, though Mr. Conte says they would tend to favor a 1950s-style jukebox musical like ''Million Dollar Quartet'' more than a punk rock show like ''American Idiot,'' which will go to cities like Chicago and Los Angeles but is not expected to play Shea's.
Still, Mr. Conte and Mr. Nocciolino resist the idea that they favor easy crowd-pleasers over more challenging fare. Mr. Conte, for instance, recalled wanting to bolt a performance of ''In the Heights'' on Broadway in 2008 because he was turned off by an early scene that unfolded in rap.
''I turned to my wife and said, 'I don't think I can sit through all this;, I can't see it playing well in Buffalo.' '' Mr. Conte said. ''But she reminded me I couldn't leave because I was a Tony voter. So I started listening to what the characters were actually saying, and soon I was drawn in. I totally loved it.''
Mr. Nocciolino, who books Broadway tours at theaters in several upstate cities, including Rochester, Syracuse, Elmira and Albany, said he believed that both risky and traditional Broadway productions would likely find audiences so long as the advertising and ticket pricing were right.
During a planning and marketing meeting at Shea's this month, Mr. Nocciolino peppered the business staff members for precise details about plans for a huge highway billboard for Shea's shows. (This season's Broadway series at Shea's is made up of ''The Lion King,'' ''Million Dollar Quartet,'' ''The Addams Family,'' ''Les Miserables,'' ''South Pacific,'' and, yes, the Tony-winning ''Memphis.'') With ticket sales running strong for ''Les Miserables,'' which is coming for the fourth time, he urged scrapping a billboard for that show and instead using the space to promote the theater's run of the Beatles' tribute concert ''Rain,'' which isn't part of the Broadway series.
The meeting soon turned to a discussion of the Broadway musicals in the 2012-13 tour series at Shea's, which will be announced in the spring. The big question among the staff was whether Mr. Nocciolino and Mr. Conte would book the biggest critical and commercial hit musical on Broadway in years, ''The Book of Mormon.'' The two men would not disclose their plans with a reporter in the room, but Mr. Nocciolino revealed that one of the show's lead producers, Scott Rudin, had met with him and a few other national presenters to learn about their markets, subscriptions and how the show might be booked there.
The Shea's staff members were all but bursting in their enthusiasm for ''Mormon.'' To their delight, Mr. Conte and Mr. Nocciolino disclosed that they were eager to bring the show to Buffalo too, seeing its loving send-up of organized religion as far sweeter and funnier than, say, ''Spring Awakening.''
''As long as we make sure subscribers know it's irreverent, we've done our job and subscribers will continue to trust our taste,'' Mr. Conte said. ''And I think Buffalo would love 'Mormon' as much as they do in Manhattan.''

HEADLINE: On Jet Exteriors, A Parade Of Vanilla

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Airplanes have become just as bland on the outside as they are on the inside.
After decades of frenzied competition and staggering losses, domestic airlines have taken a more sober approach to the business of flying, with their first priority making money. And so the fancy fuselages and lively paint jobs -- remember TWA's bold red lines? -- have gone the way of free meals, pillows and checked bags.
The color of choice these days is sensible white. White does not fade as fast in the sun and requires fewer touchups. And without the added flash of color, less paint is needed, making planes lighter and saving fuel.
''There used to be romance in air travel,'' said Steve Cone, a marketing expert who helped create the first frequent-flier programs. ''The airlines were run by dreamers, creative types and entrepreneurs. They've been replaced by penny-pinchers who don't think about the real estate outside of the plane.'' 
The staid designs reflect the current state of the industry. Unlike in their heyday in the 1970s, the airlines today have little reason to stand out. With just a handful of carriers still standing after dozens of mergers and bankruptcies, the survivors would rather focus their limited resources on improving business class, for instance.
Nor are people wowed by flying anymore. Few airports have kept observation decks, allowing travelers to marvel at planes taking off and landing. And with enclosed boarding ramps, passengers rarely even see the aircraft they board.
True, airlines still distinguish themselves with the design on their planes' tails. But in an age when airline executives resist the idea that seats are mere commodities, the industry is becoming a lot more standardized.
''Nowadays, people want reassurance,'' said Michael Bierut, a partner at Pentagram, a design firm that collaborated with United Airlines for years until it merged with Continental last year. ''That's why there is a trend industrywide to err on the side of caution.''
At the dawn of commercial aviation, from the 1920s to the 1940s, manufacturers provided planes already painted, and airlines simply added their logos. After World War II, commercial aviation boomed. Airlines sought to customize their looks and often had a different design for each model of airplane.
Until government controls on prices and routes were lifted in 1978, airlines had no incentives to compete on fares and focused instead on their service and image. That was when Braniff Airways hired artists like Alexander Calder to paint its fleet in a rainbow of colors, and Pan Am turned to the Hollywood costumer Edith Head to design uniforms for its flight attendants.
Airlines do not break out how much it costs to repaint a single plane, but it is a laborious business. The aircraft is grounded for days at a net loss. Depending on the size of the plane and the complexity of the design, it can take six to 14 days to repaint one. A Boeing 737, the most common single-aisle plane, requires 60 gallons of paint, while the Boeing 747 jumbo jet needs more than 250 gallons.
US Airways is one airline that has shifted to a white design in recent years. The carrier is the result of a long string of mergers between airlines, each with its own colorful past, including Allegheny, Mohawk and Pacific Southwest. US Airways was acquired in 2005 by America West, which kept the US Airways name but got rid of the dark blue design as the carrier's network expanded to the sunnier Southwest.
Delta Air Lines introduced its latest design in 2007 as it emerged from bankruptcy. The design featured a white fuselage and just four colors, instead of the eight used in its previous one, nicknamed ''Color in Motion.''
It returned the triangle shape on the vertical stabilizers, a throwback to the airline's origins in the Mississippi Delta. The design helped the carrier trim its costs by shaving a whole day in the painting cycle for each plane. Still, it took four years to repaint more than a thousand planes, including those of Northwest Airlines, which Delta acquired in the meantime.
''This is a business where economics determine long-term success,'' said Tim Mapes, Delta's head of marketing. ''Not without coincidence, the airlines that employed the more colorful liveries no longer exist.''
American Airlines, for its part, has remained faithful to its vintage look of polished aluminum, first used in the 1930s on its DC3s, with an orange lightning bolt running along the fuselage. It adopted the current red, white and blue stripes over a bare aluminum skin in the 1960s. (American estimates that it saves $12 million a year in fuel by not painting its planes.)
Airplane enthusiasts are not thrilled with all the new designs. ''It's gotten pretty boring,'' Manny Gonzalez, a plane spotter with an outsize camera lens, said on an early morning stakeout recently near Kennedy Airport. He was more attracted by foreign carriers sporting colorful designs than by domestic planes.
Some domestic carriers still seek to stand out. Alaska Airlines has a smiling Eskimo on its planes. (An attempt to remove him in 1988 was dropped after it raised a storm of protests. The state senate even passed a ''Don't Touch the Eskimo'' resolution.) JetBlue has nearly a dozen designs for its tails. Frontier has kept pictures of animals on its planes since its merger with Midwest last year.
Southwest Airlines has also kept a distinctive look -- painting planes red and blue, a scheme inspired by the rising sun over the Grand Canyon, according to Tim McClure, an executive with GSD&M, an advertising agency in Austin that has worked with Southwest since 1981.
When United announced its shotgun merger with Continental in May 2010, after just three weeks of secret talks, it also unveiled a new design: it simply affixed the United name onto the existing Continental colors (a white fuselage with a gray underbelly and a blue and gold globe on the tail). United fans soon set up a Facebook page called ''Save the United Airlines Tulip,'' calling on the airline to bring back its famous logo, a tulip created in the early 1970s by the designer Saul Bass.
But Mark Bergsrud, United's head of marketing, argued that the new design reflected the global reach of United's network, and its focus on attracting corporate travelers. The original Continental globe was also created by Mr. Bass in the late 1960s, although its shape was updated significantly in the 1990s by the New York design agency Lippincott.
''It fits who we are,'' Mr. Bergsrud said. ''We are not a niche player like Hawaiian, whose livery reflects the islands. Having some local flair is harder for an airline like us. Do we want to stand out? Absolutely. But spiffy liveries just have to fall to a lower level of priority.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 29, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about airlines' giving up colorful fuselage paint as a reflection of a more sober approach to the business described incorrectly the 2005 deal that combined US Airways and America West. It was a merger, and the entities retained the name US Airways; US Airways was not ''acquired'' by America West.

HEADLINE: The Big Lie

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
So this is how the Big Lie works.
You begin with a hypothesis that has a certain surface plausibility. You find an ally whose background suggests that he's an ''expert''; out of thin air, he devises ''data.'' You write articles in sympathetic publications, repeating the data endlessly; in time, some of these publications make your cause their own. Like-minded congressmen pick up your mantra and invite you to testify at hearings.
You're chosen for an investigative panel related to your topic. When other panel members, after inspecting your evidence, reject your thesis, you claim that they did so for ideological reasons. This, too, is repeated by your allies. Soon, the echo chamber you created drowns out dissenting views; even presidential candidates begin repeating the Big Lie. 
Thus has Peter Wallison, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, and a former member of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, almost single-handedly created the myth that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac caused the financial crisis. His partner in crime is another A.E.I. scholar, Edward Pinto, who a very long time ago was Fannie's chief credit officer. Pinto claims that as of June 2008, 27 million ''risky'' mortgages had been issued -- ''and a lion's share was on Fannie and Freddie's books,'' as Wallison wrote recently. Never mind that his definition of ''risky'' is so all-encompassing that it includes mortgages with extremely low default rates as well as those with default rates nearing 30 percent. These latter mortgages were the ones created by the unholy alliance between subprime lenders and Wall Street. Pinto's numbers are the Big Lie's primary data point.
Allies? Start with Congressional Republicans, who have vowed to eliminate Fannie and Freddie -- because, after all, they caused the crisis! Throw in The Wall Street Journal's editorial page, which, on Wednesday, published one of Wallison's many articles repeating the Big Lie. It was followed on Thursday by an editorial in The Journal making essentially the same point. Repetition is all-important to spreading a Big Lie.
In Wallison's article, he claimed that the charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission against six former Fannie and Freddie executives last week prove him right. This is another favorite tactic: He takes a victory lap whenever events cast Fannie and Freddie in a bad light. Rarely, however, has his intellectual dishonesty been on such vivid display. In fact, what the S.E.C.'s allegations show is that the Big Lie is, well, a lie.
Central to Wallison's argument is that the government's effort to encourage homeownership among low- and moderate-income Americans is what led to the crisis. Fannie and Freddie, which were required by law to meet certain ''affordable housing mandates,'' were the primary instruments of that government policy; their need to meet those mandates, says Wallison, is what caused them to dive so heavily into those ''risky'' mortgages. And because they were powerful forces in the housing market, their entry into subprime dragged along the rest of the mortgage industry.
But the S.E.C. complaint makes almost no mention of affordable housing mandates. Instead, it charges that the executives were motivated to begin buying subprime mortgages -- belatedly, contrary to the Big Lie -- because they were trying to reclaim lost market share, and thus maximize their bonuses.
As Karen Petrou, a well-regarded bank analyst, puts it: ''The S.E.C.'s facts paint a picture in which it wasn't high-minded government mandates that did [Fannie and Freddie] wrong, but rather the monomaniacal focus of top management on market share.'' As I wrote on Tuesday, Fannie and Freddie, rather than leading the housing industry astray, got into riskier mortgages only after the horse was out of the barn. They were becoming irrelevant in the most profitable segment of the market -- subprime. And that they couldn't abide.
(The S.E.C., I should note, had its own criticism of my column, saying that I conflated its allegations regarding the lack of disclosure of subprime mortgages, with an entirely different set of charges it has brought regarding disclosure of so-called Alt-A loans. I still maintain that the S.E.C.'s charges are weak, and that the agency brought the case in part for political reasons: how better to curry favor with House Republicans than to go after former Fannie and Freddie executives?)
Three years after the financial crisis, the country would be well served by a real debate about the role of government in housing. Should the government be helping low- and moderate-income Americans own their own homes? If so, is there an acceptable level of risk? If not, how do we recast the American dream?
To have that debate, though, we need a clear understanding of what role the government's affordable-housing goals did -- and did not -- play in the crisis. And that is impossible as long as the Big Lie holds sway.
Which, now that I think of it, may be the whole point of the exercise.

HEADLINE: Looking Up, Detroit Faces A New Crisis

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- For a city that some have declared dead again and again, the talk of late here was of renaissance -- of auto industry jobs growing, new companies moving into empty buildings downtown, urban gardens blooming in vacant lots.
Then came the revelation that Detroit is poised to run out of money by April and fall deep into debt by June. Now a place that had seemed to be finding its balance is reeling once more.
A formal state review of Detroit's books -- a step that could lead to the appointment of an outside emergency manager to take over the city's finances -- was announced this week. City leaders are conducting urgent meetings with labor union leaders and financial consultants in a race to cut costs and head off further intervention.
The possibility that an outside manager could come in -- one who would have broader than ever powers under a rewritten state law -- has stirred new concerns among financial ratings agencies and business leaders who have fresh investments in the city. City government, meanwhile, is finding itself forced to re-examine services it provides -- including buses, health care and street lighting -- and shed what it can no longer afford. 
The crisis could not have come at a worse time.
''This state is starting to come back, the economy is starting to come back, and as long as you are out there promoting all this negativity, it's no good for any of us,'' Mayor Dave Bing said in an interview. ''You don't need Detroit against the state.''
Still, Mr. Bing, a former basketball star who built an auto-parts manufacturing company, says he also knows the risks -- symbolically, financially and politically -- if a city of this size reaches a point where it cannot pay debts.
''If Detroit would ever go into default, it would kill the state,'' he said, quickly adding that he did not think the situation would come to that.
Already, though, Detroit is the only major American city with credit that sits beneath investment grade, experts say. With 11,000 city employees and 139 square miles of increasingly vacant land to tend to, it has struggled, year by year, deficit by deficit, to pay its bills. Once the nation's fourth-largest city, it has seen its population drop since a high of 1.8 million in 1950 to a low last year of 714,000.
In the eyes of some leaders, this financial crisis, despite the recent positive signs from the private sector, was decades in the making: the city never shrank its operations enough to match a shrinking tax base, and it delayed its woes with borrowing, exaggerated revenue estimates and accounting shifts.
This fall, Mr. Bing warned that Detroit would run out of cash without major cuts, particularly layoffs and deep salary reductions.
Within days of Mr. Bing's announcement, state officials said they were starting a preliminary review of the city's finances, which concluded this week with the announcement of a deeper state look at the books and an alarming snapshot of Detroit: more than $12 billion in long-term debt, an estimated general fund deficit of $196 million and no sufficient plan for dealing with the shortfall.
The state's moves have set off an uproar. Under Michigan law, a formal review must precede a state finding that a city's financial circumstances are so dire as to require an outside manager to take over -- and many here view that as the state's ultimate intent. Mr. Bing, a Democrat, and even groups he has sparred with -- the City Council and leaders of the city's 48 unions, whose contracts are the target of much of the cuts -- have pushed back, as have residents. The refrain: Detroiters can take care of Detroit just fine, thanks.
For Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican and businessman elected in the wave of Republican statehouse victories in 2010, Detroit's crisis comes at a complicated moment. Earlier this year, Mr. Snyder and the Republican-dominated Legislature passed a law adding vast powers to the emergency managers sent to troubled Michigan cities, including the ability to throw out union contracts.
Critics said the law was an attack on democratic principles and an assault on labor unions. A lawsuit is pending. A campaign to repeal the law is under way, raising the possibility that the current emergency manager law could be suspended until the vote -- even as the state's most significant city may be on the verge of being assigned one.
State officials insist that the steps taken do not mean that an outside manager will necessarily be appointed in Detroit. For his part, Mr. Snyder, who had never held political office before, seems put off at suggestions that he hopes to step in.
''Why would I want an emergency manager?'' Mr. Snyder said in an interview. ''I've got plenty to do as it is. It's best if we're a supporting resource and they resolve their own issues with support.''
That said, Mr. Snyder, a former computer company executive and venture capitalist who is trained as a certified public accountant, seems unlikely to back away without firm evidence -- perhaps a consent agreement between the state and the city -- that Detroit is taking steps to repair itself. Mr. Bing says he opposes such a commitment.
A financial control board helped pull New York City from the brink in the 1970s, and some have begun speaking of Detroit in similar terms.
''An emergency financial manager might be a blessing at this point,'' said Peter Karmanos Jr., who founded the Compuware Corporation, which moved its headquarters to downtown Detroit from the suburbs almost a decade ago.
Mr. Bing said he believed a solution was within reach. Significant concessions by the city's labor unions, whose contracts do not expire until June, would have to be a part of that, city officials say, though no agreements have been announced. Mr. Bing has called for 1,000 layoffs, a 10 percent pay cut for employees and privatization of some services, though City Council members have said cuts will have to go far deeper.
The one thing that is certain is change is coming.
''Privatization, outsourcing has always been a dirty word,'' Mr. Bing said. ''But we're talking about survival. And we can't allow our 11,000 employees that we have to dictate the future of over 700,000 people here in this city.''
On the streets here, Detroiters sound frustrated -- at the mayor, at the state, and at the possibility that more cuts might mean a further diminishment of their shrinking city.
''Are we going to survive?'' Mr. Bing says constituents are asking. ''What are we going to look like when all of these changes are implemented? Should I stay? Should I run? You hear all of that. But I think the base in this city, in terms of citizens, are fighters, and don't want to give up.''
