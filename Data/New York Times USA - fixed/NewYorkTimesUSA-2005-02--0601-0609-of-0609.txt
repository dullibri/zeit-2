HEADLINE: Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan Vote, and Observers See Trouble

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER PALA

DATELINE: FAIZOBOD, Tajikistan, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
Parliamentary elections on Sunday in two of the former Soviet Union's most remote and impoverished republics, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, were met early by complaints of violations and irregularities of the kind that led to challenges in Ukraine and Georgia.
 Preliminary results here and in Kyrgyzstan are not expected until Monday, but initial reports from international observers seemed to suggest that both governments were continuing on authoritarian paths, trying to shut out opposition groups despite promising free and fair elections.
 ''It doesn't look like there's any improvement over 2000,'' when elections in Kyrgyzstan were widely condemned as unacceptable, said an elections monitor for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in a telephone interview from Kyrgyzstan's capital, Bishkek. The observer insisted on anonymity until a formal appraisal of vote results on Monday. 
 Observers in Tajikistan said the vote there showed signs of significant manipulation. ''We are getting reports of widespread multiple voting and unrealistically high turnout figures,'' said Peter Eicher, the European monitoring group's head of mission in the country. 
 In Tajikistan, President Emomali Rakhmonov has steadily moved to take power in his own hands since an agreement in 1997 ended a civil war and promised power sharing with the country's Islamic opposition. 
 ''They pretend they are building a democratic society, because without it, the West will not cooperate with them economically and politically,'' said Muhiddin Kabiri, the leader of the country's largest opposition group, the Islamic Revival Party. 
 ''So they announce they will have a fair election with a lot of fanfare, they pass improved election laws, and then a week before it, they start violating their laws and their promises and they go back to falsifying the results because they're afraid to take any risks,'' he said Sunday during a drive to his constituency in Faizobod, near the capital, Dushanbe. 
 The United States has been supportive of Mr. Rakhmonov, who came to power in 1992 during a five-year civil war that killed 100,000 people. The American ambassador, Richard Hoagland, said that since then, Mr. Rakhmonov ''has done a remarkable job of bringing stability to the country.'' 
 But political analysts, including the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit group based in Brussels that works for conflict resolution, say stability has come at a high price.
 Mr. Rakhmonov has amassed near-absolute power, pushing through constitutional changes that allow him to be re-elected until 2020. He held substandard elections in 2000 that gave two seats to the Islamic party and none to other opposition parties, and two years ago fired all the opposition figures he had hired under the 1997 agreement.
 ''Pluralism is accepted as long as it does not threaten the status quo,'' the crisis group wrote in its latest report on Tajikistan. Of the six existing parties, the president's Popular Democratic Party, an offshoot of the old Soviet Communist Party, dominates political and economic life in this nation of six million people. Membership is de rigueur not only for civil servants, but also for owners of large businesses. 
 The chairman of the party's central committee, Muso Asozoda, said that all parties should be represented in Parliament and that the elections were fully free and fair.
 He dismissed as hypocritical complaints that an $800 deposit imposed on all candidates -- returnable only if the candidate is elected and equivalent to eight years of average wages -- prevented many opposition figures from running. ''Those are lies,'' he said in an interview. ''They all drive $30,000 Mercedeses.'' 
 While Tajikistan's election campaign was subdued to the point of near invisibility -- candidates were allowed a single 15-minute speech on television -- a more liberal atmosphere pervaded in Kyrgyzstan.
 There, a physicist named Askar Akayev with no ties to the old Communist power structure was elected president in 1990 and charmed the West with his embrace of nongovernmental organizations and Western values. But elections five years ago failed to meet international standards, and he has responded to accusations of nepotism and corruption by muzzling the news media.
 He has come under criticism for helping the candidacies of his daughter and son. Last week, thousands of demonstrators protested the disqualification on a technicality of an opposition candidate and former diplomat, Roza Otunbayeva, who was running against Dr. Akayev's daughter, Bermet Akayeva.
 The elections in the two countries seemed to be continuing a rough stretch for democracy among former Soviet republics. Popular uprisings overturned fixed votes in Ukraine and Georgia in the past year. And an improved election law in Kazakhstan seemed to make little difference in the parliamentary vote there last fall that ended in a complete shutout of the opposition -- the sole challenging candidate to win a seat refused to take it in protest.

HEADLINE: Governors of 13 States Plan to Raise Standards in High Schools

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
The governors of 13 states with more than one-third of the nation's students said Sunday that they were forming a coalition to improve high schools by adopting higher standards, more rigorous courses and tougher examinations.
 Unless the nation takes drastic measures on high schools, they said, the United States will lose its competitive position in the world economy.
 ''For the first time, a group of states will reshape an institution that has far outlasted its usefulness,'' said Gov. Bob Taft of Ohio, a Republican. ''More than five million students each year -- 35 percent of public high school students nationwide -- will be expected to meet higher requirements under this landmark initiative.'' 
 The 13 states are Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Texas. Other states are expected to join the coalition in the next few weeks.
 Six foundations offered $23 million to help states remodel their high schools. The largest grant, $15 million, was from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which directly assists hundreds of high schools across the country.
 Over the weekend, governors, business executives and Bush administration officials built political momentum for the ambitious agenda on high schools at an ''education summit'' meeting convened by the National Governors Association.
 Mr. Taft said the skills required for college and for jobs in the 21st century were ''very similar.'' The Labor Department says two-thirds of all new jobs will require some postsecondary education.
 Arthur F. Ryan, chairman of Prudential Financial, said business executives would lobby state legislatures to carry out the agenda announced on Sunday.
 Governors and education officials in the 13 states said they would take the following steps:
 $(6$)Raise high school standards to reflect the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in college or the work force.
 $(6$)Restore the value of a high school diploma by requiring all students to take rigorous courses that prepare them for college and work.
 $(6$)Test students regularly to measure their progress in meeting stringent state standards. Colleges and employers now pay little attention to state test results because the exams do not measure the skills that students will ultimately need.
 In addition, governors from the 13 states said they would hold high schools accountable, by publishing more data on dropout and graduation rates. Some states focus on the proportion of 12th graders who fail to graduate, overlooking the fact that many high school students drop out before their senior year.
 Chester E. Finn Jr., an education scholar who served in the Reagan administration, said the conference could be a turning point, forcing governors to face a two-pronged problem: ''Many kids graduate from high school without having learned much, and significant numbers of kids are not even graduating.''
 ''Governors who put their mind to this can make a really big difference in their states,'' Mr. Finn said in an interview. ''The education system responds to external pressure, carrots and sticks, and governors are pretty good at wielding those.''
 Arlene Ackerman, the superintendent of schools in San Francisco, said: ''To those of us at the local level, it's really important that governors are making this a priority. High schools will, as a result, get more attention and resources.''
 President Bush's education secretary, Margaret Spellings, welcomed the initiative. ''Talk is cheap,'' she told the governors, ''but you all have a record of solving the problems you talk about.''
 The conference was the fifth national summit meeting on education, but the first devoted to high schools. The original session, organized by the first President Bush in 1989, ended with a mandate to devise a set of national goals for education. Subsequent sessions promoted testing and accountability, codified in the education legislation known as the No Child Left Behind Act. Under that law, signed in January 2002, public schools must test students yearly in Grades 3 to 8 and once during high school.
 President Bush called recently for annual tests in reading and mathematics in the 9th, 10th and 11th grades. ''I've heard every excuse in the book not to test,'' he said in a visit to a high school in Falls Church, Va. ''My answer is, how do you know if a child is learning if you don't test?''
 Gov. Mark Warner of Virginia, a Democrat who is chairman of the association, said governors wanted higher standards for high schools but not ''the rigidity'' of No Child Left Behind, with its ''bureaucratic oversight from Washington.''
 Among those supporting the governors' initiative are the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, with a grant of $4 million; the Carnegie Corporation of New York, $2 million; and the Wallace Foundation and the Prudential Foundation, $1 million each.
 Arne Duncan, the chief executive of Chicago public schools, said his city had simply shut down some failing high schools and moved students to higher-performing campuses.
 Roy Romer, a former governor of Colorado who is now the superintendent of schools in Los Angeles, said it was essential to replace large, impersonal high schools with ''smaller schools where a child knows all the faculty and they know him.'' Mr. Romer said Los Angeles had several high schools with more than 5,000 students, adding that ''a kid can easily get lost in a school of that size.''
 ''The success of a state economically and socially depends on the quality of the schools,'' Mr. Romer said in an interview. ''So governors must take political responsibility for schools in their state,'' even if they do not have the legal responsibility.
 Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, said an aging population made it more difficult to muster support for large investments in public education.
 Mr. Rendell estimated that 12 percent of the adults in Philadelphia had children in public schools. This, he said, helps explain why it is difficult to pass referendums for school construction.

HEADLINE: A Tribe, Nimble and Determined, Moves Ahead With Nuclear Storage Plan

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: SKULL VALLEY, Utah 

 BODY:
The Goshute Indians are not mighty in number, financial capital or political clout. With only about 120 members, their tribe has mostly been a footnote in the long saga of American Indian history in the West.
 Their reservation, just slightly bigger than Manhattan, is mostly empty -- a windswept land of sage and scrub 50 miles west of Salt Lake City. 
 But over the last eight years the Goshutes (formally the Skull Valley Band of Goshutes) have outlasted, outwitted and outplayed powerful forces arrayed against them, as they have sought to build what would be the nation's biggest bunker for the storage of highly radioactive waste.
 Some tribal members say such a facility would give them an economic boost in an area of the state where Indians have had few environmentally friendly options. 
 The State of Utah, backed by environmental groups from around the West, has argued that a storage dump would be a catastrophe-in-waiting -- too close to a major population center, too dependent on the movement of highly dangerous waste by rail, too vulnerable to terrorists.
 A governor who strongly opposed the plan, Michael O. Leavitt, came and went. Legislators and lawyers have filed in and out like players on a stage. And the Goshutes have soldiered on, winning at just about every turn.
 ''This isn't their backyard, it's our backyard,'' said Leon D. Bear, the tribe's chairman, in an interview on the reservation where he had stopped by the tribe's gravel mining business one recent morning.
 On Feb. 24, a panel of administrative law judges handed the tribe yet another victory, concluding that concrete casks containing spent fuel rods from nuclear power plants could withstand a direct hit from a crashing jet. That ruling opened the door for a decision by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to grant a license for the facility, though that would certainly only begin more legal skirmishing.
 ''It could happen as soon as a month,'' said Mike Lee, the general counsel to Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr., referring to a regulatory commission license. ''We're fighting it from every angle that we can.''
 This is no simple David and Goliath tale, however much the Goshutes may seem to be the little tribe that could. Tribal leaders admit that they have big backers for their plan and that the utility industry consortium that wants to build the $3 billion plant, called Private Fuel Storage, has bankrolled the legal fight.
 State officials, meanwhile, say they have had to walk a narrow diplomatic line in fighting the proposal. As much as they might attack the utility industry for its goals here, they say, they must affirm the rights of the Goshutes to govern their own affairs. 
 A legacy of suspicion and mistrust colors the effort on both sides. Tribal leaders say that the state has never respected the Goshutes, and that their reservation has been encircled for decades by environmentally bad neighbors that the tribe had no say or veto power over.
 A military nerve gas storage facility sits just to the east of the reservation. A coal-fired power plant is to the south.
 ''The band was never consulted or asked its opinion of the placement of these industries on what was once traditional Goshute territory,'' reads a display at the Pony Express Store and gas station on the reservation. The state's financial support for dissidents within the tribe -- more than $500,000 in legal bills paid to support challenges to the storage plan -- has also backfired, as tribal leaders have portrayed the relationship as one more example of state meddling.
 State officials say the environmental record in this part of the West scares them, too, and reinforces their resolve to fight the Goshutes. Nuclear testing in the 1950's in Nevada is blamed for high rates of cancer in some parts of western Utah. The topic still touches a nerve, compounded all the more by the fact that Utah has no nuclear plants and so no waste of its own to store. 
 ''It goes back to a lack of trust,'' said Dianne R. Nielson, executive director of the Utah Department of Environmental Quality. ''The lies that people were told and the suffering and death it created are not lessons that anybody in Utah is forgetting -- and they shouldn't.'' 
 Meanwhile, energy experts say the political ground beneath the Goshute debate has shifted. When the Private Fuel Storage project was proposed in the late 1990's, a permanent home for the nation's nuclear waste, at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, seemed largely on track for completion by 2010. But delays and questions about geological safety have thrown that schedule into disarray.
 At the same time, a renewed interest in nuclear energy has raised the possibility that more nuclear power plants could be built around the nation, bringing more waste with it.
 State officials say they worry that ''temporary'' would become permanent, either because Yucca Mountain never opens, or because there is so much waste that both facilities are needed. 
 Within the tribe there is no shortage of disarray, either. Mr. Bear was indicted by a federal grand jury in December on charges that he improperly used tribal funds. Three members of a tribal faction that opposes Mr. Bear's leadership are also facing trial, on bank fraud charges.
 All the parties have pleaded not guilty; their respective trials are scheduled to begin this spring.
 And while part of the debate within the tribe involves who should rightfully lead, the deeper question, tribe members say, concerns the effects of the storage plan on tribal culture and economic life.
 Mr. Bear argues that because the environmental degradation in this part of Utah is already endemic from businesses and military facilities, tribes have been closed off from tourism and other environmentally clean sorts of economic development.
 Nuclear waste storage, he added, might sound bad but would provide an economic base that could help the Goshutes maintain their culture and identity for generations.
 ''You can't go back,'' he said. ''Our traditions will stay alive with our children. I'm only making a foundation for them.''
 Some opponents of the storage plan say Mr. Bear, who grew up off the reservation but returned as an adult, is ignoring the power of Goshute traditions, and the spiritual connection to the land that they say could be destroyed by storing nuclear waste here.
 ''He's trying to justify what he's doing, using economic development as a shield to put the waste wherever he wants,'' said Margene Bullcreek, a tribe member who opposes the storage plan. ''We're concerned with health, but it's also the land we believe in. I think this could destroy whatever sacredness is there.'' 
 Supporters of the storage plan say that changes to the land can be positive, like new homes and community buildings constructed in the last few years in part with money flowing from the project's backers.
 ''In the past two years, I've seen a big change here -- a community building, a ballpark, a playfield,'' said Garth Bear Jr., who is Leon Bear's nephew and supports the storage project. ''These are the first new buildings on the reservation since I was in elementary school 30 years ago,'' he said.
 ''I'm a traditionalist, and I know the sun dance ways,'' he added. ''But I've never seen anybody live off being a traditionalist; you can't do that.''

HEADLINE: Vocational Education

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''High School Reform, Round 1'' (editorial, Feb. 23) rightly calls for vocational education programs that ''offer a sound academic grounding along with preparation for the new economy's high-skill jobs.'' Congress should look to the New York State Regents policy on career and technical education, or C.T.E., programs to see vocational education's future.
 The Regents require C.T.E. programs to integrate sound academics with technical coursework. Students are expected to pass all academic and technical courses, Regents exams and a technical assessment in their field of study.
 An independent evaluation of the 700 new C.T.E. programs showed that their students are passing the Regents exams at rates equivalent to other students, passing technical assessments that provide a ticket to high-skill jobs and post-secondary technical programs, and graduating at high rates.
 Congress should reject the proposal to kill the $1.3 billion federal vocational education program and instead build on the key elements of the New York C.T.E. program. The State Legislature should follow suit with additional financing.

HEADLINE: Don't Blame Wal-Mart

BYLINE: By Robert B. Reich. 
Robert B. Reich, the author of ''Reason: Why Liberals Will Win the Battlefor America,'' was secretary of labor from 1993 to 1997.

DATELINE: Berkeley, Calif. 

 BODY:
BOWING to intense pressure from neighborhood and labor groups, a real estate developer has just given up plans to include a Wal-Mart store in a mall in Queens, thereby blocking Wal-Mart's plan to open its first store in New York City. In the eyes of Wal-Mart's detractors, the Arkansas-based chain embodies the worst kind of economic exploitation: it pays its 1.2 million American workers an average of only $9.68 an hour, doesn't provide most of them with health insurance, keeps out unions, has a checkered history on labor law and turns main streets into ghost towns by sucking business away from small retailers.
 But isn't Wal-Mart really being punished for our sins? After all, it's not as if Wal-Mart's founder, Sam Walton, and his successors created the world's largest retailer by putting a gun to our heads and forcing us to shop there.
 Instead, Wal-Mart has lured customers with low prices. ''We expect our suppliers to drive the costs out of the supply chain,'' a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart said. ''It's good for us and good for them.'' 
 Wal-Mart may have perfected this technique, but you can find it almost everywhere these days. Corporations are in fierce competition to get and keep customers, so they pass the bulk of their cost cuts through to consumers as lower prices. Products are manufactured in China at a fraction of the cost of making them here, and American consumers get great deals. Back-office work, along with computer programming and data crunching, is ''offshored'' to India, so our dollars go even further.
 Meanwhile, many of us pressure companies to give us even better bargains. I look on the Internet to find the lowest price I can and buy airline tickets, books, merchandise from just about anywhere with a click of a mouse. Don't you?
 The fact is, today's economy offers us a Faustian bargain: it can give consumers deals largely because it hammers workers and communities.
 We can blame big corporations, but we're mostly making this bargain with ourselves. The easier it is for us to get great deals, the stronger the downward pressure on wages and benefits. Last year, the real wages of hourly workers, who make up about 80 percent of the work force, actually dropped for the first time in more than a decade; hourly workers' health and pension benefits are in free fall. The easier it is for us to find better professional services, the harder professionals have to hustle to attract and keep clients. The more efficiently we can summon products from anywhere on the globe, the more stress we put on our own communities.
 But you and I aren't just consumers. We're also workers and citizens. How do we strike the right balance? To claim that people shouldn't have access to Wal-Mart or to cut-rate airfares or services from India or to Internet shopping, because these somehow reduce their quality of life, is paternalistic tripe. No one is a better judge of what people want than they themselves.
 The problem is, the choices we make in the market don't fully reflect our values as workers or as citizens. I didn't want our community bookstore in Cambridge, Mass., to close (as it did last fall) yet I still bought lots of books from Amazon.com. In addition, we may not see the larger bargain when our own job or community isn't directly at stake. I don't like what's happening to airline workers, but I still try for the cheapest fare I can get.
 The only way for the workers or citizens in us to trump the consumers in us is through laws and regulations that make our purchases a social choice as well as a personal one. A requirement that companies with more than 50 employees offer their workers affordable health insurance, for example, might increase slightly the price of their goods and services. My inner consumer won't like that very much, but the worker in me thinks it a fair price to pay. Same with an increase in the minimum wage or a change in labor laws making it easier for employees to organize and negotiate better terms.
 I wouldn't go so far as to re-regulate the airline industry or hobble free trade with China and India -- that would cost me as a consumer far too much -- but I'd like the government to offer wage insurance to ease the pain of sudden losses of pay. And I'd support labor standards that make trade agreements a bit more fair.
 These provisions might end up costing me some money, but the citizen in me thinks they are worth the price. You might think differently, but as a nation we aren't even having this sort of discussion. Instead, our debates about economic change take place between two warring camps: those who want the best consumer deals, and those who want to preserve jobs and communities much as they are. Instead of finding ways to soften the blows, compensate the losers or slow the pace of change -- so the consumers in us can enjoy lower prices and better products without wreaking too much damage on us in our role as workers and citizens -- we go to battle.
 I don't know if Wal-Mart will ever make it into New York City. I do know that New Yorkers, like most other Americans, want the great deals that can be had in a rapidly globalizing high-tech economy. Yet the prices on sales tags don't reflect the full prices we have to pay as workers and citizens. A sensible public debate would focus on how to make that total price as low as possible.

HEADLINE: Wisconsin Town Reeling Over Closing of Lands' End Call Center

BYLINE: By AARON NATHANS

DATELINE: CROSS PLAINS, Wis., Feb. 24 

 BODY:
This village of 3,084 lost two major employers in two years. But Lands' End was supposed to be different. 
 The company, known for its fleecy clothes and folksy sales pitch, has long been a great source of employment for people of Cross Plains, a 15-minute drive from Madison. 
 But Lands' End, which was acquired by Sears, Roebuck & Company two and a half years ago, announced this week that it would close its Cross Plains call center in June, putting the 200 people there out of work. They are among the 375 full- and part-time employees in Wisconsin who have lost their jobs in a revamping of the company. Additional seasonal employees will also be cut. 
 ''It puts a lot of close-knit people out of work, said Diana Kolden, a Cross Plains resident taking a break at Sport Bowl, a four-lane bowling alley. ''They worked for years and depended on that company. They burned us.''
 Jackie Schutty, a Lands' End spokeswoman, said customers were more apt now to buy over the Internet than the telephone. Three call centers in other Wisconsin towns will remain, she said. 
 ''Lands' End is still very committed to our customers and our employees,'' Ms. Schutty said. 
 But some residents of Cross Plains were more skeptical.
 ''With a major buyout like Sears, you know there's going to be cost-cutting measures,'' said Mike Roessler, a Cross Plains real estate broker. ''They have to watch the bottom line. When you're owned by the person who started the company, these decisions are harder to make.''
 Sears announced late last year that it would merge with Kmart. Many business analysts have said the fit between Sears and Lands' End has been awkward, and that the Kmart merger only further complicates it. Sears deferred comment on the layoffs to Lands' End.
 Lands' End was founded in 1963 in Chicago by Gary Comer and initially sold sailboat hardware and equipment. It eventually turned to selling casual clothing and moved its headquarters to Dodgeville, Wis., 35 miles from Cross Plains. The company offers on-site child care and an 80,000-square-foot fitness facility at its Dodgeville plant, and is known for flexible work hours and generous corporate donations.
 Ray Aldag, professor of management at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Business, said the layoffs ''shatter the culture'' of Lands' End's small-town family feel. Mr. Aldag spoke of a ''psychological contract,'' in which the employees work hard, ''and the company will provide you with secure employment and a family-oriented culture. This is a body blow.''
 ''It's a situation where the culture was developed over decades. These sorts of things can just be destroyed overnight,'' Dr. Aldag said.
 Residents of this village have been dealt several setbacks in recent years. Zander's, the oldest butter manufacturer in the state, went out of business last year, the victim of a major recall of its butter. And a tool maker, Roto Zip, closed its Cross Plains headquarters in 2003, when it was sold to the Robert Bosch Tool Corporation, based in Chicago. About 50 jobs were lost with each closing.
 All the closings are adding up, said Jane Bautch, who said a friend with four children under age 10 lost her job at Lands' End. The family had just built a new house in Cross Plains near the call center, she said.
 ''It's two minutes from home, two minutes from school. It's convenient, it's easy. And they have no idea what they're going to do,'' she said.
 The village president, Richard Anderson, said there were a lot of hurt feelings. 
 ''This is a real disappointment. Since Lands' End has been purchased by Sears, it's no longer a family-oriented company,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''It's creating turmoil in our village.''
 One resident, Dave Parmeter, 62, said he understood why the change had to happen. The call centers are quickly becoming a relic, he said. Even libraries are becoming quaint in a world where children can do all their research from home, he said.
 ''I believe management has taken into consideration what's happening in the real world,'' Mr. Parmeter said. ''We are no longer a function of snail mail.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Reviewing European Proposal for Iran

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Tehran for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is considering a proposal by Britain, France and Germany to offer Iran trade benefits, commercial aircraft and aircraft spare parts in return for dismantling what is suspected of being a nuclear weapons program, European and American officials said Sunday.
 The officials provided details of the proposal on a day when Russia agreed to supply Iran with fuel for a civilian nuclear power plant in exchange for its promise to return the spent fuel. Russia maintained the step would help keep Iran from making nuclear weapons. 
 The United States has led a worldwide campaign to persuade both Russia and its European allies to ensure that Iran does not proceed with what it charges are plans to turn its civilian nuclear energy program into a cover for making nuclear bombs. 
 Iran denies that it has a weapons program, but the International Atomic Energy Agency has found that it has failed to disclose elements of what it maintains is a civilian program.
 Under an agreement signed in Tehran, Iran and Russia agreed that Russia would supply fuel for Iran's first nuclear power plant, at Bushehr in southern Iran, which is to become operational later this year or early next year. The accord would provide fuel for 10 years, after which Iran plans to make its own fuel.
 The United States wanted Russia not to supply any fuel to Iran unless Iran stopped all activities to produce weapons-grade fuel on its own. But in the end, the Bush administration accepted Russian promises that it would insist on the spent fuel being returned so that it could not be used for weapons.
 Europeans, meanwhile, have been acting under strong American pressure to negotiate a deal with Iran to end a separate program to enrich uranium. As with the Bushehr plant, Iran insists it wants to use the enriched uranium for civilian purposes. 
 When President Bush was in Europe last week, he listened to specific proposals for economic incentives for Iran from Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, President Jacques Chirac of France and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany.
 The specifics of the incentives were not disclosed at the time, but Mr. Bush and his aides did say he would consider the proposals when he returned to Washington.
 A senior administration official said Sunday that the specific European proposals for trade benefits, spare parts and aircraft were discussed among cabinet members on Friday, but that no decision had been made on whether to give the Europeans approval to make the offer to Iran.
 While Russia has been negotiating its own deal on Bushehr with Iran, talks between the Europeans and Iran have sputtering since fall, with European officials increasingly concerned that American participation was essential.
 A European official said, however, that Mr. Bush told his European counterparts last week that if he joined in the negotiations with Iran, it would cause a political furor in the United States and signal prematurely that Washington was prepared to recognize the legitimacy of the Iran government.
 As an alternative, the European and American officials said that Britain, France and Germany wanted American permission to discuss Iran's possible accession to the World Trade Organization -- which would confer trade benefits to Iran but also impose requirements to open Iran's economy -- and also to discuss aircraft sales.
 ''What we need to do is put together elements of economic incentives for Iran,'' said a European official, asking not to be identified because the discussions were confidential. ''For that we need an agreement with the United States because this cannot be done against the will of the United States.''
 He added, ''A green light from the United States would add a lot of leverage to our capacity to negotiate with the Iranians.''
 But a senior administration official said only that Mr. Bush would agree to consider the proposal. 
 ''President Bush said he would listen to the Europeans,'' he said. ''They have been saying that a signal of support for World Trade Organization and a willingness to sell aircraft parts are two of the things they're looking for. True to the president's word, he is looking at it. But at this point there's no decision.''
 The Bush administration has argued that neither the uranium enrichment plant discussed by the Europeans, nor the Bushehr plant involved in the Russian talks, is necessary for Iran's needs because of the country's large oil reserves.
 Like its European allies, Russia has said that it does not want Iran to have nuclear weapons, but that it is not convinced that Iran has such an objective in mind. Russia maintains that with proper safeguards, there is no risk that fuel can be diverted for use in weapons.

HEADLINE: In a Surprise, Pearson Says Its Chairman Will Resign

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
Dennis Stevenson, chairman of the publishing group Pearson, plans to step down this year after two decades on the board, the company said Sunday. 
 Lord Stevenson, 59, has been chairman of Pearson, which owns Penguin books and The Financial Times newspaper, for eight years. The unexpected announcement came the day before Pearson was scheduled to present its 2004 results. 
 Analysts predicted the company would report an estimated 6 percent drop in revenues and a 3 percent decrease in profits, in part because of poor performance from Penguin and the weak dollar. Pearson also owns The Economist magazine, a large educational publishing business and Internet operations. 
 Like other media companies, Pearson has struggled in the last few years with declines in advertising revenue. At Pearson, the situation started to look brighter in July 2004, when the company said in its results for the first half of the year that revenues from business advertising had grown for the first time in three years.
 The imminent departure of Lord Stevenson, a high-powered management consultant and former adviser to Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, is seen as a blow to the fortunes of Marjorie M. Scardino, Pearson's chief executive. Lord Stevenson was instrumental in recruiting Ms. Scardino to the company in 1997 and in helping her shepherd Pearson through a reorganization that has yet to show all of its promised results. 
 Analysts, investors and members of the British media seemed to view Lord Stevenson and Ms. Scardino, who is from Texas, as trans-Atlantic foils. Together, they ''forged a new corporate style -- Oxbridge cool,'' The Sunday Times of London said last October. ''The duo meshed the acuity of the Oxbridge common room with Bill Gates's shrewd-nerdy approach to business,'' the paper said.
 In recent years, Pearson has become more focused, according to analysts, but has been stymied by lower advertising spending and consumer publishing problems in the United States. In addition, Ms. Scardino has taken on additional responsibilities once held by Peter Jovanovich, chief executive of Pearson Education and a member of the Pearson board. On Jan. 31, Pearson said that Mr. Jovanovich would go on long-term medical leave. 
 In a financial update issued in January, Pearson said that its higher education publishing business had grown for a sixth consecutive year in 2004, and that The Financial Times broke even in the fourth quarter, the first time it had done so in two years. But, the company added, ''Penguin suffered as tough trading conditions persisted through the holiday season, particularly in U.S. mass market and backlist titles.''
 Lord Stevenson's plans to depart were first reported in The Sunday Times this week, forcing Pearson to announce the news earlier than it had planned. In a statement the company issued Sunday, Lord Stevenson said that Pearson was in ''excellent shape'' and ''looking forward to some very good years under a strong executive team led by Marjorie.''
 He added that he was planning ''new projects'' outside the world of publicly traded companies. ''The board and I have naturally been discussing plans for my succession for some time, and this is a good moment to formalize the process,'' he said. 
 The company did not elaborate on his reasons for leaving or pinpoint when he would do so, but it did say that his successor would be chosen by a new board committee, headed by Pearson's senior independent director, Terry Burns. A successor is expected this year. 
 Lord Stevenson is also chairman of the British bank HBOS, and will renew that position this year, the bank said in a statement on Sunday. Serving as a chairman for two companies has become increasingly unusual in Britain, especially since a report on corporate governance that was sponsored by the British government criticized the practice in 2003. HBOS did not pressure Lord Stevenson to give up one of his chairmanships, said Shane O'Riordain, a bank spokesman, on Sunday.
 Other media executives in London said they predicted that Lord Stevenson would take a government position, or even another chairman spot, despite his statement about projects outside the corporate realm. 
 ''Dennis is very focused on his career,'' said one executive.

HEADLINE: U.S. Loans for Reactors In China Draw Objections

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
The Westinghouse Electric Corporation plans to present a bid to China on Monday for building four huge nuclear reactors, backed by a pledge of nearly $5 billion in financial assistance from the United States government that it hopes will give the company an edge over competitors from France, Germany and other nations. 
 But the package of loans and loan guarantees does not follow the typical pattern of the government's Export-Import Bank, and is raising objections from some critics. 
 Approved on a preliminary basis by the bank on Feb. 18, the package is almost three times larger than anything the bank has offered before. And while it would stimulate employment in the United States, the price would amount to about $1 million a job. The package also appears to benefit the British government, which owns Westinghouse through BNFL, the company formerly known as British Nuclear Fuels. 
 ''If the risk were not falling on the Ex-Im bank, it would be falling on the British government,'' said Peter A. Bradford, a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from 1977 to 1982. Mr. Bradford said he opposed the subsidy to a foreign company, and what he said was support by the commission for Westinghouse's sales efforts. ''Jobs really aren't what this is about. What it's about is protecting the investors in the company making the bid, and here, there is only one investor.'' 
 Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, an Ohio Democrat who is a frequent critic of the bank, said, ''The bank is funded by U.S. tax dollars; they should be supporting U.S. companies. I'm not against U.S. jobs, but shouldn't we be for U.S. companies?'' 
 Mr. Kucinich said that the deal could also eventually hurt the export of technology from this country because China has said that it wants to build many more plants and take over the manufacture of the components, many of which are now made in the United States. 
 A spokesman for the bank, Phil Cogan, said the aid package had ''nothing to do with shareholders.'' The package, which would go to the bank for final approval if Westinghouse won the bidding, ''is for the Westinghouse Electric Company of Monroeville'' in Pennsylvania, he said. Ownership of the company ''makes absolutely no difference,'' he said.
 BNFL bought Westinghouse's nuclear unit from CBS, the broadcasting company, in 1998. BNFL's other businesses in the United States have met with mixed success. The company contracted in the mid-1990's with the Energy Department to build a factory in Washington State to solidify liquid nuclear wastes, but the two entities had a rancorous falling-out over costs and other factors. This month, BNFL and the Energy Department settled a long dispute over BNFL's performance in cleaning up former nuclear weapons sites in Tennessee and Idaho. 
 The British government has intermittently discussed selling BNFL and its Westinghouse subsidiary, and recently reorganized the company. To make the company more attractive, the company recently separated some of its unprofitable ventures, including liabilities related to a subsidiary that recovered plutonium from spent nuclear fuel for reuse.
 A spokesman for Westinghouse, Vaughn Gilbert, said in a telephone interview from the company's headquarters in Monroeville, near Pittsburgh, that the proposal to build the Chinese reactors represented about 5,000 jobs in the United States because components like the instrumentation and control systems would be manufactured here. The reactor vessel and the steam generators, the largest parts, would come from other countries. 
 Westinghouse would also supply the fuel, at least initially. China has expressed interest in building dozens more reactors and sticking to a standard design, so winning this contract could mean many years of business, although fewer parts would be imported as time went on. Bidders are hoping for a decision from China by the end of the year. 
 The Westinghouse design is said to incorporate ''passive'' safety features that require fewer active parts, like pumps, relying instead on features like cooling through natural heat circulation. It is called the AP-1000, for ''advanced passive.'' None have yet been sold. Spencer Abraham, a former secretary of energy, told reporters after an appearance last week at the United States Energy Association that if China chose the Westinghouse design, it might make it easier for electric utilities to build that model here. 
 Mr. Cogan, the Ex-Im spokesman, said that the bank was backing only the portion of the contract that would involve work in the United States. According to Westinghouse, the American portion of the deal is half the reactors' value, suggesting that the four reactors would cost $10 billion, but the company would not disclose the amount of its bid.
 Asked how the level of support -- almost $5 billion for 5,000 jobs -- compared to that of other projects that the bank had nurtured, he insisted that the bank had no yardstick, and that dividing the amount of support by the number of jobs was not a good measure. ''That's a crazy equation,'' Mr. Cogan said. 
 The bank's announcements about its loan and loan-guarantee packages often give few details, but in several recent cases where an amount and a number of jobs were specified, the dollars-per-job figures were far smaller. 
 For example, on Feb. 24 the bank announced it would guarantee a loan of $500,000 to a company in Carson City, Nev., that exports hoses, fittings, nuts and bolts, and that this would create up to 18 new jobs, which comes to less than $30,000 a job. On Jan. 11, it announced a guarantee that helped provide a $315,000 loan for a company in Oakmont, Pa., that makes equipment for testing the efficiency of filters. The company had three employees but was faltering, the owner said in the announcement; with the loan it got more business in China, and expanded its work force by two. That works out to $63,000 a job. 
 Mr. Cogan said that the cost to American taxpayers would depend on the success of the project; if the loans are paid back on time, they could generate a profit for the bank, he said.
 Gary C. Hufbauer, a former deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury for international trade and investment policy and now a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a nonprofit group here, said that at one time the bank had a requirement that 65 percent of the work be in this country. But, he said, ''the choice is, as this case illustrates, not between 100 percent U.S. and 100 percent U.S.; it's 50 percent U.S. and no percent at all. And 50 percent is better than nothing.''
 But Michael Mariotte, the executive director of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, an antinuclear group based here, said, ''you can think of other corporations that would be sounder risks.'' He added, ''I'm sure there's cheaper ways to generate 5,000 jobs.''
 ''A lot of the money is not staying in the United States, and whatever profit is made on this deal is going to the U.K.''
