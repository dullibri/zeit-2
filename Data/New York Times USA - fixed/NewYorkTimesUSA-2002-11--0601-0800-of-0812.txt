HEADLINE: Winning the Peace in Afghanistan 

 BODY:
Congress has handed the Bush administration a chance to live up to its noble rhetoric about rebuilding Afghanistan. Last week legislators authorized the spending of more than $3 billion over the next four years on reconstruction and expanded peacekeeping for that war-ravaged country, far more than the White House has previously sought. Mr. Bush should call on the new Congress to appropriate these urgently needed funds without delay when it convenes in January. 
 Afghanistan requires substantial outside help to avoid returning to the lawlessness that opened the door to the Taliban a decade ago. The same conditions made it possible for Osama bin Laden to use the country as a headquarters and training ground for international terrorism. 
 Much of Afghanistan's infrastructure is in ruins, its people are without constructive employment and its new central government barely rules beyond Kabul's city limits. A generation of Afghan men has known little but incessant warfare since Soviet troops invaded the country in 1979. Afghanistan's women were long shut out of education and employment. 
Those who survived and the millions of refugees now returning need help re-establishing their lives and moving back to the land. Agriculture remains the base of Afghanistan's economy and its most promising source of new jobs. Decades of war ruined irrigation projects, scattered seed stocks and destroyed the roads needed to transport agricultural goods to market. The central government also needs help paying the salaries of civil servants and establishing its authority throughout the country. Schools must be rebuilt and children inoculated against polio and other diseases. Other countries are willing to help, but America must lead the way.
The new legislation authorizes $425 million a year for such recovery projects and sets up an enterprise fund that could provide a total of $300 million in seed money to start and sustain new businesses. It also provides authority for spending on security needs, including $1 billion that the administration should use to expand peacekeeping forces beyond Kabul. President Bush has vowed not to repeat the mistake of the late 1980's when America abandoned Afghanistan after the Soviet military withdrawal. By using the new spending authority Congress has handed him, Mr. Bush can keep that promise.

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials Will Try to Help Tame Afghanistan Border Trade 

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: LAHORE, Pakistan, Nov. 20 

 BODY:
A Treasury official said today that in an effort to help Afghanistan gain control of customs revenues, the department would be sending customs officials to assess the chaotic and largely unregulated system at the country's main border crossings. 
 The decision came in response to a request that President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and his finance minister, Ashraf Ghani Ahmedzai, made of Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill on Monday in Afghanistan, the official said. 
 Mr. O'Neill, continuing his trip in the region, met with officials today in Pakistan, which as Afghanistan's main trading partner will feel the effects of any changes at the border. The customs officials could be out examining border crossings and depots before the end of the year. 
Security arrangements have yet to be worked out, but Treasury officials mentioned a plan to establish an American presence in Afghanistan's main regional cities, staffing outposts with consular, development and security officials. The western city of Herat and the southern city of Kandahar, both of which have heavy customs traffic, were cited as likely locations for such outposts. 
The officials will focus on volume of trade at important border crossings, watching for bottlenecks and other problems that may be delaying the movement of goods. The plan is part of a broader strategy to help Afghanistan and other countries in the region -- particularly Pakistan -- bolster their economies by improving trade. It was a theme Mr. O'Neill touched upon several times here today, notably in a speech at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. "I hope for a day when Pakistan and its closest neighbors, Afghanistan and India, will enjoy more fully the benefits of open regional trade," he told students. 
Later he said, "The more people can work with each other, visit each other's places, create jobs in each other's homelands, the more we can reduce the threat of misunderstandings and wars." 
The Afghan government has also requested a World Bank assessment of trade potential in Afghanistan and the region as a whole, Mr. O'Neill said. He added that the World Bank and customs studies would most likely proceed in tandem. 
Afghanistan has for centuries been a famous through-route for trade, which goods traveling overland along the silk road and Afghans have always been successful traders and merchants. Trade has surged again since the defeat of the Taliban, with imports pouring in, from all directions, the bulk arriving via Iran to the west and Pakistan to the east. There have also been some imports from Central Asia, Russia and China. But American customs officials assessing border crossings will find a completely unregulated system, much of it controlled by regional warlords who bypass the central government. 
As Mr. O'Neill put it during an interview between meetings today, "In this part of the world there is a combination of formal trade barriers and informal passage collections, and half of them occur simultaneously." 
He added: "The finance minister told me it costs $200 for a truck to go from Pakistan to Kabul. And that is not collected by the government, but by patrols under the bridge." 
He described the injury caused by this system as twofold: Not only is the government missing out on its revenue, but the levy itself damages commerce and hurts the consumer.

UBS Closes Trading Floor That It Acquired From Enron
Less than a year after acquiring Enron's energy trading operation, UBS Warburg said that it would reduce the size of the unit and shut down the trading floor in Houston. The operation, which had about 630 employees when UBS acquired it, is expected to be reduced to fewer than 100 employees, all of whom will be moved to Stamford, Conn.
 The decision comes during a sharp downturn in the energy trading business and after some large trading companies have announced plans to scale back their operations or exit the business. Page C4.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
When it comes to crystal-ball gazing, the Fed trounces the private sector.

BYLINE:  By Hal R. Varian; Hal R. Varian is an economics professor and dean of the School of Information Management and Systems at the University of California at Berkeley. E-mail:hal@sims.berkeley.edu.

 BODY:
THE Fed gave the economy a flu shot earlier this month by cutting interest rates half a point. But it was quick to point out that, as with a real flu shot, this was intended only as a preventive measure.
 "The economy's most likely projection is to come out of this soft spot and to start accelerating," the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, told Congress. 
 Other Fed officials are also positive about the economy. Gary H. Stern, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said, "There is no question that an economic expansion, an economic recovery, is under way." And Roger W. Ferguson Jr., the Fed's vice chairman, said, "The pieces are in place to engender a gradual strengthening in economic activity." 
Unfortunately, business leaders do not share the Fed's optimism.
According to a report by the Business Roundtable, 60 percent of executives surveyed said they planned to eliminate jobs next year, while only 11 percent thought they would add jobs. Similarly, 19 percent expect to increase their investment next year, while 24 percent expect to reduce it.
Whom should we believe: the Fed or the executives? After all, the executives are actually making economic decisions, while the Fed is only trying to forecast what they will do. What do those guys in Washington know, anyway?
Plenty, it turns out.
For evidence, turn to "Federal Reserve Information and the Behavior of Interest Rates," a paper in the American Economic Review in June 2000 by Christina and David Romer, two economists at the University of California at Berkeley. 
The Romers ask whether the Fed has an advantage in predicting economic variables and, if so, what the source of that advantage is. The answer to the first question is a resounding yes. The answer to the second is a bit more tentative: the Fed is better at forecasting than the private sector, but we're not sure why.
The Romers look at two variables: inflation and output growth. Both attract intense interest in Washington and on Wall Street.
Forecasts for both variables are prepared by the Fed staff before each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which uses these forecasts to help set economic policy. The forecasts are closely guarded secrets and are released to the public only after five years.
How good are the Fed's forecasts? To answer this question, the Romers compare the forecasts from 1965 to 1991 with those of several private forecasting services.
The Romers first look at how well private forecasts have predicted inflation, then ask whether the forecasters could have improved their performance if they had been given access to the Fed forecasts. The researchers find that the Fed forecasts offer big improvements over the private ones. In fact, if you had access to both forecasts, a good rule of thumb would be to rely exclusively on the Fed and ignore the private predictions.
Why are the Fed's forecasts so much better? There are several possible explanations. First, the Fed may have inside information about the course of monetary policy since setting that policy is one of its most important jobs.
The problem with this explanation is that monetary policy has little effect on the economy in the short run -- it takes three to four quarters to show up in aggregate statistics. Yet the Fed's forecasts are better than the private sector's even for very short-term forecasts.
Perhaps the Fed gets official data earlier than the private sector? This is also an unconvincing explanation, as the Fed chairman gets access to current economic data just the night before it is released to the public.
The most likely explanation for the Fed's superiority in forecasting inflation, the Romers say, is that the Fed devotes "far more resources to forecasting than even the largest commercial forecasters."
It's not that it has better information about the state of the economy, or secret forecasting methods -- it simply looks at a lot more information, has a lot more staff and has a lot more experience. So it is not too surprising that the Fed does better.
These days the big economic uncertainty is not so much about inflation (or deflation) but about output. Everyone wants to know when the economy will resume robust growth. Does the Fed's forecasting superiority extend to G.D.P. growth?
The answer is yes: the researchers find that the Fed is also substantially better at predicting output growth than the private sector. But the Fed's advantage in this case is not so large as with predicting inflation. In the case of output growth, the optimal forecast would combine both the private and the Fed forecasts, though it would give more weight to the Fed's forecast.
In the case of output forecasting, the Romers suggest that the Fed's advantage may in fact be, at least in part, a result of better access to data since the Fed manages the collection of information used to compute the index of industrial production.
Note that the Berkeley economists' study is mostly pre-Greenspan; Mr. Greenspan joined the Fed in August 1987, while the Romers' data ends in 1991. Mr. Greenspan is well known for reading a variety of economic tea leaves, but most of the data he uses appears to come from reports available to the private sector. His forecasting success seems to come not from special ingredients, but from a finely tuned sense of how ordinary ingredients should be combined.
As he indicated last week, the economy is in a soft spot. Consumers have grown more cautious, and businesses have not yet resumed robust investment spending. The Fed's worry now is that excessive pessimism on the part of executives will dampen, or even stall, the current recovery.
This was probably part of the reasoning that led the Fed to make the unusually large cut in interest rates last week. The cost of borrowing is now at a historic low, which should encourage even the most pessimistic executives to think about investing.
Let's hope the rate cut works, for the sake of the economy -- and the Fed's forecasting record.

HEADLINE: Its Eyes Fixed on Terrorism, Congress Put Off Many Bills 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 

 BODY:
The 107th Congress will conclude a tumultuous two years on Friday when a few House members gather to give quick final approval to legislation creating the Department of Homeland Security. That measure, born out of the Sept. 11 attacks, illustrates how the terrorist assaults defined the Congress and diverted lawmakers from domestic issues to national security and foreign affairs.
 With its attention fixed on terrorism and the midterm elections, Congress was never able to resolve its differences on prescription drug coverage for older Americans, overhauling welfare, energy policy or even the routine spending bills that finance government operations. Those issues have been pushed over to the Congress that will convene next year under full Republican control. 
 "A lot of what we will do in the first part of next year is finish up work undone," Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, the incoming majority leader, said today as he waved a facsimile report card giving the Democratic-led Senate a failing end-of-the-session grade. 
Despite the focus on what was not done, lawmakers approved President Bush's tax cuts, tightened corporate oversight, passed a sweeping antiterrorism law, authorized President Bush to act against Iraq, overhauled the campaign finance system, passed a trade bill and agreed on the new antiterrorism agency. A bipartisan House-Senate inquiry also produced evidence of intelligence lapses preceding the Sept. 11 attacks.
Those ends were achieved against a background of partisanship that grew out of a presidential election that was thrown into the courts, as well as the sudden shift of power to Democrats in the Senate in May 2001 caused by Senator James M. Jeffords' decision to leave the Republican Party. Then came the Sept. 11 assaults, followed weeks later by an anthrax attack on Capitol Hill.
"A lot of turmoil, a lot of disruptions," said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana. "It has been a very emotional two years and yet some good things were done."
Others were less charitable. Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, said that besides the tax cuts and supporting the president in the effort against terrorism, "I am hard pressed to express a great deal of pride in anything else we did."
Assessing the Congress today as the Senate was gaveled into adjournment by 99-year-old Senator Strom Thurmond, the retiring South Carolina Republican, lawmakers in each party credited the House and Senate, in concert with the White House, for the response to the terrorist attacks. Yet Republicans and Democrats expressed frustration over their legislative failures and blamed the opposition for obstructionism.
"I believe the Democrats decided not to allow certain issues to pass," said Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, who said the intent was to deny Republicans successes. But Mr. Sessions said the plan backfired, as demonstrated by the election results that put Republicans in charge of the House, Senate and the White House come January.
Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader who has been the target of Republican criticism for his management of the Senate, said Republicans were responsible for the gridlock of the last months of the session, before a flurry of bills was adopted in the post-election session.
He said Republicans made a "calculated political decision" to hold up the approval of the domestic security measure and other initiatives to bolster their chances in this month's elections. "The same compromises and agreements that we were seeking before the election, we got after the election," said Mr. Daschle, who said he hoped the spirit of working together extended into 2003. 
Some Democrats say they are bracing for a "rough and tumble" Congress next year should Republicans try to use their new muscle.
"The next Congress could end up being very unproductive," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut.
But Republicans say they intend to try to work with Democrats, though they may have no choice but to do so given the still narrow margins in the House and Senate.
"Our attitude is we will continue to reach out to people, we will try to bring people in," said Nicholas E. Calio, the top White House lobbyist on Capitol Hill, who said President Bush believes that voters want accomplishment, not argument.
Mr. Calio said that from a historical perspective the White House considered this an "extraordinarily productive session." He said most new presidents in their first engagement with Congress get "one or none of their major issues through." But he ticked off the budget that laid the ground work for the tax cuts, education changes, the legislative response to Sept. 11, new trade promotion authority and the Iraq resolution. 
He and others said Republicans would start the new year concentrating on an economic growth package, drug coverage for older Americans and the stalled spending measures.
Relations were strained between Republicans and Democrats from the start given the protracted fight over the election.
President Bush met with Democrats in early February and promised to reach across the aisle, but Democrats said his bipartisan overtures clashed with the way he pushed through his $1.3 trillion tax cut on a near party line vote in the House. He did attract some Democratic backing in the Senate. And he worked with Democrats on an education measure that promised more money for schools while instituting new testing, though critics say the administration still has not fully financed the bill. 
The political terrain shifted drastically when Senator Jeffords, a moderate from Vermont, announced that he would become an independent and vote with Democrats, abruptly throwing Republicans out of their chairmanships and giving Democrats a critical power base. That decision left the Senate as the focal point in Congress while House Republicans, enforcing strict party discipline, were able to move ahead on issues like prescription drug coverage and energy policy.
The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon temporarily closed the partisan divide and lawmakers quickly provided the president money and authority to act against the terrorists, giving law enforcement broad new investigatory powers. Democrats did fight successfully to reduce the president's ability to employ military force and limit some of the new police powers. But most members of Congress thought the immediate post-Sept. 11 period was a model of cooperation.
With elections that would determine Congressional control looming, reaching agreements became much more difficult in 2002. Weeks of Senate time were devoted to a fruitless search for a prescription drug compromise. Negotiators were unable to devise an energy program, which before Sept. 11 was a top White House priority, as the Senate adamantly opposed opening the Arctic refuge to oil drilling. 
The Senate failed to adopt a budget and the appropriations process collapsed in differences over spending. Revelations of corporate wrongdoing did spur a substantial change in laws governing the accounting and securities industries.
Then President Bush in June reversed himself and came out for a sweeping reorganization of federal agencies into the new Homeland Security Department. As progress faltered, Democrats accused Republicans of trying to turn the legislation into a campaign weapon by proposing changes in rules governing federal workers; Republicans accused the Democrats of trying to thwart the president on domestic security. 
The lame-duck session ended on another stalemate when the House and Senate were unable to agree on an extension of unemployment benefits, which will run out on Dec. 28.

Museums

"A LEGACY IN LANDSCAPES," New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089 (through Jan. 4). More than 100 additions to the library's voluminous print collection by nearly 60 artists, from Fragonard and Pissarro to present-day practitioners like Alex Katz, Roxy Paine and Terry Winters are on display. Mostly traditional printmaking methods are used and the choices are fairly conservative at the contemporary end. So Sylvia Plimack Mangold's drypoint and etching "Maple Tree" (1998), for instance, a close-up rendering of intersecting bare-tree branches, keeps good company with William Delamotte's etching of almost 200 years earlier, "Beech in Windsor Forest." (1805-6), a stagey old monster whose thick, knotty ramifications are examined in minute detail. But the continuity is pleasurable. All in all, the library has chosen well. Hours: Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free (Grace Glueck).

* "THE ADVENTURES OF HAMZA," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718 638-5000 (through Jan. 26). If Great Books were judged great by size and illustrations alone, the "Hamzanama," or "Story of Hamza," made for the Mughal emperor Akbar in 16th-century India would be one of the greatest of all. It was originally more the 1,200 pages long. Each page was two feet tall. The paintings, which tell of the encounters of the mythical warrior-prince named Hamza with demons, dragons and giants, are fantastic. The book exists only as fragments now, but about 200 of the finest surviving pages have been brought together from around the world for this exhibition. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3, students and 62+ (Holland Cotter).

"AN AMERICAN LEGACY, A GIFT TO NEW YORK," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Jan. 26). The Whitney trustees pooled their pennies, acquired $200 million worth of postwar American art and gave it all to the museum as a gift. The 87 works, dating from the 1940's through the 1990's, enhance and subtly reshape the museum's account of American modernism. And they are all temporarily on view in this showcase, which ranges from classic Abstract Expressionist painting (Kline, Pollock, Still) to early Pop (pre-silkscreen Warhol), with lots and lots of Jasper Johns. Most of of the choices are predictably canonical; the show perks up with odd-duck contributions by Jay DeFeo and Lucas Samaras. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8, students and 62+ (Cotter).

* "DRAWING NOW: EIGHT PROPOSITIONS," Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Jan. 6). This generous sampling of work by 26 young artists provides a sweeping, even opulent view of drawing at the threshold of the 21st century. The variety of techniques and materials, the mix of large-scale feats of draftsmanship with clusters of framed works, the breadth of sources (from American quilt patterns to Japanese anime to 19th-century illustration) and the range of narrative ambition create an exhilarating sense of possibility. Some of the artists illustrate rather than fully embody the curators' categories, and there is an excess of fashionable, even overexposed artists from a handful of hot galleries. Nonetheless, "Drawing Now" is required viewing for anyone remotely interested in today's art. It sets a standard for future shows of its kind. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m; until 7:45 p.m. on Fridays. Admission: $12; $8.50, students and 65+ (Roberta Smith).

* "CARROLL DUNHAM: PAINTINGS," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Feb. 2). Also, "Carroll Dunham: Drawings, 1985-2002," Nolan/Eckman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 925-6190 (through Dec. 20). Two midcareer surveys of Mr. Dunham trace his arc across two decades from psychedelic abstraction toward a figuration of escalated nuttiness and technical panache. He is squarely at the heart of the modern cartoon aesthetic; its pathos may turn out to be the signature of our age. In his case, abject subject matter and woolly psychodrama are tempered by low-key amiability. When his works fail, they fail in the direction of too-easy decoration and cheerful psychedelia. Otherwise, they succeed on the bases of sly humor, self-mockery and a kind of sneaky, unpretentious charm. There is no preaching or political doctrine. His paintings emerge from the act of painting; they are Process Art of a peculiar kind and they deliver us into a funny-sad realm, conjured up to purge a few ghosts, maybe, and to provide us with pleasure. That, and the sense of wit to recognize our essential folly, is plenty. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students, artists and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

"GREAT MASTERS OF MEXICAN FOLK ART FROM THE COLLECTION OF FOMENTO CULTURAL BANAMEX," National Museum of the American Indian, at the United States Custom House (Smithsonian Institution), 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700 (through March 15). This big, lavish crowd-pleaser offers a colorful and entertaining selection of more than 500 works by 181 contemporary Mexican artisans, and it includes sculpture, furniture, ceramics, weavings, toys, religious objects, glassware, beadwork, leatherwork and much more. Fine craft predominates, but there are works of compelling imagination, too, like the wonderfully animated wooden fantasy animals of Manuel Jimenez Ramirez; the magical, intensely patterned ceramic assemblages of Alfonso Castillo Orta; and the crowded miniature bullfight scene carved from a log by Hipolito Vazquez Sanchez. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays until 8 p.m. Free (Ken Johnson).

* "KAZARI: DECORATION AND DISPLAY IN JAPAN: 15TH-19TH CENTURY," Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155 (through Dec. 31). The hard-to-grasp term kazari refers to the decorative arrangement of objects. And it is demonstrated with enchanting results in a show that demolishes the cliche of Japanese art as inherently minimalist. Here everything is layered: something is always in front of or behind or above something else, and each something has its own painted, incised or embroidered intricacies. This results in a total environment of conspicuous but elusive richness, encompassing painted screens, samurai jackets and Kabuki costumes that sag under acres of padded silk and gilded thread. It's maximalism all the way. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students and 65+ (Cotter).

* "THE LEGACY OF GENGHIS KHAN: COURTLY ART AND CULTURE IN WESTERN ASIA, 1256-1353," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Feb. 16). You may arrive expecting a little more razzle-dazzle from an exhibition that is supposedly about a bloodthirsty conqueror, but Genghis Khan doesn't actually have much to do with this. The show is really about his heirs, including Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan dynasty in China, and Hulagu, who subdued Baghdad and established the rule of the Ilkhanids. The interchange between China and Iran under Mongol rule is the show's leitmotif. There are textiles, works of gold and silver and illuminated books, which are astonishing. (There are 21 illustrated pages from the Great Mongol Shahnama, one of the masterworks of Islamic art.) Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $7, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

"PAINTED SAWS: JACOB KASS," American Folk Art Museum's Eva and Morris Feld Gallery, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue near 66th Street, (212) 595-9533 (through Dec. 1). After six decades as a decorative painter of commercial trucks in Brooklyn, Kass (1910-2000) retired to Vermont and began painting landscapes on old handsaws and other tools. Thus he transformed himself into a modern folk artist. Most compelling is the way the tapered saw blade becomes a trapezoidal window through which to view bucolic landscapes painted with a sensuous, skillful but not too fussy touch. Crisscrossing perspectives in urban scenes creates compositions bordering on Cubism. Avoiding gimmickry and excessive sentimentality, Kass produced objects of forthright charm. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free (Johnson).

"DAGOBERT PECHE AND THE WEINER WERKSTATTE," Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 (through Feb. 10). This survey of the Austrian designer Dagobert Peche (pronounced DAH-go-bert PEH-kuh) is a case study in the use of material objects to effect cultural reform. And the installation is as lively as any design show New York has seen. Peche, who died in 1923 at age 36, represented the second generation of the Wiener Werkstatte, whose designers regarded decorative objects as ideological vessels. But his highly ornate work is in full contrast to the spartan aesthetic associated with the movement. With more than 400 drawings and objects on view, the show is a tumble of stylized flora and offers an equal range of materials: fabric, wallpaper, precious metals, ceramics, wood and glass. How did Peche get away with it? Though Baroque in sensibility, his work was not historicist. It was a light, individual interpretation of a massive court style. Like Philippe Starck and Ettore Sottsass today, Peche designed rooms of inner nature, enclosures for emotion. Hours: Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 65+ (Herbert Muschamp).

* "POUSSIN, CLAUDE AND THEIR WORLD: 17TH-CENTURY FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM THE ECOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS, PARIS," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Dec. 1). The Ecole des Beaux-Arts, the world's oldest surviving art school (founded in 1648), assembled an enormous collection of works to instruct its students in the discipline of drawing. Those from the 17th century, the great age of Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, are especially outstanding. The 71 here survey French drawing from 1620 to 1680, when classicism came to French art, aiming to restore High Renaissance ideals of clarity, order and balance, with the Italian painter Raphael as a revered model. The emphasis is on the works of Poussin (1594-1665) and Claude (1604-1682), a history painter and a landscapist. But lesser-known masters like Simon Vouet, Eustache Le Sueur and Charles Le Brun are also included. Wicked doings in the Bible, sex in mythology, the ordered schematics of French architecture and the pomp and circumstance of the French court are some of the subjects covered in the drawings, which should send any aficionado to the Frick on the run. Hours and admissions: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $12; $5, students; $8, 62+ (Glueck).

* "BILL VIOLA: GOING FORTH BY DAY," Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 12). An ambitious meditation on the epic themes of human existence, this frescolike video installation consists of five panels, shot using the latest technology and projected simultaneously on the walls of one huge gallery. Each deals with a specific theme: rebirth, journey through life, disaster, death and resurrection. Except for a few scenes, the action is almost in slow motion, suggesting the stasis of looking at paintings and allowing the viewer to shift attention from panel to panel without losing focus. The work was mostly shot before the Sept. 11 disaster but is amazingly prophetic of it. If some of the imagery is corny, it is still a deeply felt and provocative piece of work. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $9, students and 65+ (Glueck).

Galleries: Uptown

* "ART OF THE SAMURAI," Scholten Japanese Art, 63 East 66th Street, (212) 585-0475 (through Dec. 6). Militaristic samurai culture produced some of the wildest looking armor ever made. You'll get a full sense of its extraterrestrial oddity and delicacy in this show, where complete suits of armor are supplemented by displays of helmets, swords and woodblock prints. It's a dynamite show (Cotter).

* "MADE IN CHICAGO: CIRCA 1970," Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338 (through Nov. 30). This engrossing selection of works by Chicago Imagists includes beautiful paintings of anxious encounters between weirdly deformed men and women by Jim Nutt; a numinously nostalgic farmscape by Roger Brown; antic watercolors of striving tubular people by Gladys Nilsson; a mysterious, fetishistic painting by Christina Ramberg; and H. C. Westermann's first "Death Ship" (Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

LOUISE BOURGEOIS, Susan Sheehan, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 489-3331 (through Nov. 30). Sketchy prints from the 1990's by this eminent sculptor afford fleeting glimpses of a mysteriously elusive mind. A suite of drypoints is devoted to spiders, who symbolize the artist's mother; one comical howling arachnid is shown giving birth. "Anatomy," a 12-piece portfolio, includes a torso with multiple pneumatic breasts; a picture of sultry, slightly crossed eyes; and a naked woman hanging by her long hair from a laundry line (Johnson).

"JAMES BROOKS: FIVE DECADES," Joan T. Washburn, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-6780 (through Nov. 30). Brooks (1906-92) came to Abstract Expressionism after a period of Cubist-influenced figurative painting. Quieter and gentler in style than most of his colleagues, he experimented with "accidents" of pigment splotches more to enlarge his painter's vocabulary than to reveal his psyche. The most interesting painting here is "Evine" (1982), a beautifully balanced, majestic canvas with adventurous color harmonies, which shows what a good painter Brooks was at his best (Glueck).

WILLIAM CLUTZ, Katharina Rich Perlow, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 644-7171 (through Dec. 7). Since the late 1950's, Mr. Clutz has been painting the street life of New York, simplifying its complexity to the brink of abstraction. The canvases in this five-decade survey call to mind Edward Hopper's romantic nostalgia and Alex Katz's suave modernity (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

JORDAN CRANDALL, "Trigger," Henry Urbach Architecture, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-0974 (through Dec. 1). Projected on opposite walls, this 18-minute video montage features two naked muscular men, one black, the other white, stalking each other with rifles in a shadowy, theatrical setting suggestive of a war-torn city. Part soft pornography, part political allegory and part Modernist play with media, it is a heavy-handed sermon about masculinity, sex, surveillance and violence (Johnson).

JERALD IEANS, Lucas Schoormans, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3159 (through Dec. 14). This young, self-taught painter produces economical, well composed arrangements of biomorphic forms on medium-large canvases. With their overlapping, amoeboid shapes in shades of gray or muted pastels, finely combed textures and sharp edges, Mr. Iean's paintings have great decorative appeal. Slyly sophisticated updates of Miro-style Surrealism, they are formally restrained yet funky (Johnson).

* BRUCE NAUMAN, Van de Wegh Fine Art, 521 West 23rd Street, (212) 929-6633 (through Dec. 14). This three-decade survey administers a substantial dose of Bruce Nauman's cerebrally punishing visual poetry. Neon signs feature flat-footed word play; one, for example, blinks "war" one way and "raw" the other. Most repellant are sculptures made from the animal forms used by taxidermists: a mobile has dangling cast-aluminum dogs with legs cut off and re-attached in reverse (Johnson).

LISA ZWERLING, First Street Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, (646) 336-8053 (through Dec. 7). Ms. Zwerling paints romantic fantasies of harmony among humans, animals and nature in a delicately naturalistic style. The main attraction here is a rocky landscape in which a naked child armed with a violin casts a musical spell over such savage beasts as a bear, a lion and a pair of wolves (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

ENID BAXTER BLADER, "Letter From the Girl, Mailed at the Gas Station," Location One, 26 Greene Street, (212) 334-3347 (through Dec. 28). Cerebral film buffs might find in Ms. Blader's 18-minute video projection all kinds of inside references and jokes about film noir, B movies and other sorts of low-end cinematic Pop. A puzzling montage of scenes set in a rural wasteland features a woman in a trench coat on the run, a mysteriously menacing 1980's-style bar girl and an overweight bleached blonde looking for someone who remains unspecified. Instead of plot, there's a curious blend of suspense and tedium (Johnson).

"DAN KEPLINGER, A K A KING GIMP," Phyllis Kind, 136 Greene Street, (212) 925-1200 (through Dec. 7). The subject of the 2000 Oscar-winning documentary, "King Gimp," Mr. Keplinger has cerebral palsy, which keeps him in a wheelchair and requires him to paint using a brush attached to his head. Despite these obstacles he paints and draws with ambitious verve, creating aggressively expressionistic self-portraits in acrid, muddy colors. This is the 29-year-old artist's second New York solo, and it shows a heartening determination (Johnson).

PAUL NOBLE AND GIOVANNI BATTISTA PIRANESI, Susan Inglett, 100 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0573 (through Dec. 14). Among the most impressive works in the Museum of Modern Art's "Drawing Now" exhibition are Mr. Noble's huge architectural fantasies. His two etchings on view here, though ordinary in scale, are similarly absorbing in their detail and narrative lunacy. They are well matched by four views of ancient ruins by Piranesi, the great 18th-century printmaker and architectural visionary (Johnson).

"ROSIE LEE TOMPKINS: AFRICAN-AMERICAN QUILTMAKER," Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through Dec. 28). Ms. Tompkins's ravishing quilts connect to several traditions, including African bark cloth paintings, American textiles and, not least of all, modernist painting. But look, don't think. These pictorial powerhouses are like multifaceted jewels spread flat before the eye yet turning in the light, their sparkling shards of color and mutating geometries full of mystery and life (Smith).

Galleries: Downtown

"ALIVE AND KICKING: THE COLLAGES OF CHARLES HENRI FORD," the Scene, 42 Rivington Street, (212) 674-0508 (through Dec. 12). Ford, who died in September at 94, was an early version of today's global artist. Born in Mississippi, he moved back and forth among America, Europe and Asia, producing copious amounts of poetry, but also films, sculptures and, in the early 1990's, a series of small, Surrealist-tinged collages. He seems to have clipped material from design, nature and soft porn magazines, then pieced the visual data together with shrewd wit, binding the series with the motif of half-abstract figures resembling those found in early Dubuffet. Someday we'll get a retrospective; meanwhile, this show makes an important contribution (Cotter).

VIRGIL MARTI, Participant, 95 Rivington Street, (917) 488-0185 (through Dec. 22). Participant is Manhattan's newest nonprofit alternative space and for its inaugural show Mr. Marti, a Philadelphia artist, has covered the walls in sheets of reflective mylar, the kind used to raise plants (notably marijuana) in hydroponic gardens. Each sheet is imprinted with images of flowers and patterns of broken linear grids. Suspended from the ceiling are chandeliers made from colored resin casts of deer antlers, with blossoms at the tips. The results merge pop culture, weird science and the psychedelic wooziness of a funhouse mirror, disconcertingly crowned by trophies of a kill (Cotter).

CLAUDIA AND JULIA MULLER, Maccarone, 45 Canal Street, (212) 431-4977 (through Dec. 5). The New York solo debut of a Swiss-born sister team includes large scale collaborative drawings done from found objects (pizzeria menus, rock club posters) and photographs (Carnival revelers, children dressed as American Indians), and a projected video of drawings. The video image is of a nuclear family -- two adults, two children -- that continually alters in appearance. Figures fade in and out, changing sex and race so that various combinations of heterosexual "differences" are played out in a gentle acknowledgment of a social and genetic revolution that is, in fact, in progress (Cotter).

VINCE ROARK, ATM Gallery, 170 Avenue B, near 10th Street, (212) 375-0349 (through Nov. 24) Mr. Roark is in his 70's and lives in Kansas City, Mo., where he has been producing elaborate geometric drawings, along with related sculptural constructions, for some 40 years. His tools are simple: pencil, pen, colored markers, compass and protractor. But his ideas about dimensional exploration -- ones that jibe with utopian scientific theories of early modernists like Malevich and Kandinsky -- are complex, and the largest, densest, most labor-intensive of his drawings shimmers with a kind of exalted concentration (Cotter).

Other Galleries

* "THE AGES OF MANKIND: TIME TO HOPE," Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 932-7347 (through Dec. 6; daily, 9:30 a.m. to noon and 1 to 5 p.m.). All but unheralded, this show seems to have dropped into New York like an unbidden gift, and what a gift: 100 superb examples of Spanish religious art, which is some of the most rapturous and wrenching religious art ever made, seen in a perfect setting. The works include Romanesque madonnas, Gothic crucifixions, paintings of saints by El Greco and Goya, and a handwritten letter by St. Teresa of Avila, all from churches, monasteries and museums in the Spanish provinces of Castile and Leon. The images, among them life-size polychrome sculptures, are sexy, gruesome and above all theatrical, projecting big, primary emotions. The effect is gloriously intense (Cotter).

* "BETWEEN WORD AND IMAGE: MODERN IRANIAN VISUAL CULTURE," Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780 (through Dec. 7). This no-frills exhibition is about the dynamics of cultural borrowing, the inseparability of art and politics and the interplay of modernism and Islamicism. It begins with painting and sculptures from the 1960's in which Western styles and Iranian themes merge. It continues with riveting photographs documenting the arrival of the Iranian Revolution in 1979. And it ends with art that the revolution produced: political posters inspired by both the Western counterculture and militant Islamic ideology. Depending on the amount of reflective synthesis you're willing to do, the results can seem richly layered, or disjointed and undercooked. But the materials and the ideas on display are fascinating (Cotter).

ALEX GREY, Tibet House, 22 West 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 807-0563 (through Jan. 3). Mr. Grey's painting, with its tantric symbolism, medical-illustration finesse and New Age optimism, might be described as psychedelic realism. In it, the human figure is rendered with X-ray or CAT- scan transparency, the way Aldous Huxley saw a leaf when he was on mescalin. Mr. Grey's images have been appropriated by a countercultural audience: they have shown up on promotional posters for rave events and on paper used for blotter-style LSD. But they look right at home at Tibet House, where contemporary versions of religious tankas, meant for esoteric instruction and meditation, often hang (Cotter).

Last Chance

* PAUL FEELEY/PETER CAIN, Matthew Marks, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200; PAUL FEELEY, Lawrence Markey, 42 East 76th Street, (212) 517-9892 (both through tomorrow). Linking Mr. Feeley, an associate of the Color Field painters of the 1960's, and Mr. Cain, who in the 1990's made paintings of surrealistically compacted cars, makes Matthew Marks's two-part exhibition a memorable exercise in contemporary taste-making. Feeley fans may see more canvases and works on paper at Lawrence Markey (Johnson).

* "JUMP," the Painting Center, 52 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 343-1060 (through tomorrow). Organized by the painter Ross Neher, this selection of small to medium-size abstractions by 11 artists locates an underappreciated intersection of personalized formalism and sensuous process where many painters are working these days. Stephen Ellis's percussive grids, Ruth Root's funky Cubism, David Baggenstoss's shimmering veils, James Lecce's confectionery swirls and Carolanna Parlato's intensely colored pours contribute to an experience of immediate visual gratification (Johnson).

DOUG OHLSON: "20 YEARS OF PAINTING, 1982-2002," Times Square Art Gallery, Hunter College, 450 West 41st Street, (212) 772-4991 (through tomorrow). As a painter, Mr. Ohlson has never needed a subject other than color, and here his geometrically abstract but sensuous canvases dazzle with surprising juxtapositions in which one color deeply affects the persona of another. Over the years his style has gone from hard-edge geometric with high-contrast hues in the 1960's to a much more expressive use of lighter, translucent areas with softer edges and closer color values. The progression is interesting to follow, and the color, with a few misses here and there, is an enveloping pleasure (Glueck).

* "PROCACCINI IN AMERICA," Hall & Knight, 21 East 67th Street, (212) 772-2266 (through tomorrow). Who knows when the last time was that a commercial gallery organized an old master retrospective as ambitious as this. It includes a dozen pictures by Giulio Cesare Procaccini (1574-1625), the obscure Lombard Mannerist turned Baroque painter. He was a learned artist of intense and eccentric gifts, melding diverse influences. "The Holy Family With the Infant St. John and an Angel" is perhaps the quintessential Procaccini: a knot of shadowy bodies crowd forward around the brightly illuminated Virgin and Child, with one figure, in the darkness, cut off by the top of the picture. The work is freely, briskly painted, wet into wet; the surface lush, the colors rich and haunting: a painter's painting (Kimmelman).

"SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT," Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 925-4338; and Leo Castelli, 59 East 79th Street, (212) 249-4470 (through tomorrow). Works by John Baldessari, Rita McBride, David Salle and Lawrence Weiner occupy two galleries to play with ideas about doubling. Each artist presents more or less similar works in each gallery, prompting thoughts about absence and presence, the original and the copy, the portable and the site-specific; and so on. It's an interesting idea but the addition of unrelated works confuses the conceptual effectiveness (Johnson).

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
Turning the Big Screen Into the Small Screen

BYLINE:  By ELVIS MITCHELL 

 BODY:
Filmmakers looking to master the no-budget digital video movie -- which has morphed into a new and often visually tacky subgenre -- need look no further than "Personal Velocity," where Ellen Kuras's cinematography possesses delicacy and freshness.
 Ms. Kuras understands first and foremost that there's no point in trying to pretend that digital video is the same as film. Nor does she light "Velocity" in a way that awkwardly tries to replicate film, a fool's errand. Instead she uses the strengths of digital and wisely chooses to go smaller; she shoots the picture as if it were hand-painted, an intimacy that complements the writer and director Rebecca Miller's script and handling of her actors. 
 The cumulative effect is that of watching misspent lives disintegrate before your eyes. Ms. Miller's canny accomplishment is a triumph, giving the material weight and heart. This is one of the finest pictures of the year because Ms. Miller's knowledge of her characters is mirrored by the secure palette of Ms. Kuras's camera work.
"Velocity," which opens today in New York City and Los Angeles, is taken from Ms. Miller's collection of prose portraits of the same name; it is a triptych, telling the stories of three women. In adopting a piecemeal approach, Ms. Miller uses women of varying humors and temperaments to address an open-ended subtext. Each of these self-contained stories puts the protagonist at a crisis in her life and develops the drama in a free-floating manner. The movie centers on how the women choose to address the problem. (In spirit, the movie mirrors the low-budget adaptation of Grace Paley's urban tales "Enormous Changes at the Last Minute.")
In the first episode Delia (Kyra Sedgwick) is a single mom whose freedom is her body and her uncomplicated sexuality. Ms. Sedgwick is like yards of silk unfurled, flowing and snapping in a glorious midday sun -- the very spectacle makes you smile.
She has finally found a character for her full, rich eyes and long, expressive arms; she plays Delia as a woman who takes life one delicious moment at a time, getting as much pleasure from her kids as she does seeking earthy delight.
When her world begins to fall in on her, one wall at a time, Delia shows the damage slowly, blow by blow. Her pride grows out of her innate ability to enjoy herself; being trapped in an oppressive, abusive relationship deprives her of that gift. She's like a small, abandoned boat taking on water. It won't be long before she goes under.
Ms. Miller shifts tone from story to story with unhurried aplomb; it's as if she takes a deep breath before beginning each new section. The second part stars Parker Posey as Greta, and is played for tense, flamboyantly neurotic comedy. Ms. Miller stages this portion with tightly controlled cameras; characters walk in and out of the unmoving frame, desperate to stake a claim. (It's a page from Ingmar Bergman's notebook that Woody Allen so wisely appropriated.)
Without the loose, rollicking tenor of Delia, Greta is a woman who's all concentration; she seems to exist from the neck up, an exercise of sheer will working to exert some control in the face of her faintly disapproving father (Ron Liebman flexing dismissive eyebrows). Greta's life is in the Manhattan publishing world, where she buzzes through one task after another. Ms. Posey demonstrates a variety of comic skills: she's often like a chatty Fitzgerald heroine, all porcelain perfection, with a modern touch of self-awareness; she knows she's falling apart and is determined to follow through on the disintegration. That doesn't make her plight and her need to be consumed by all the wrong decisions any less hilarious or heartbreaking.
Greta's dilemmas are depicted with such relish and energy, you'll wish her section were longer. The first two stages of "Velocity" are so confidently rendered that the final segment has a lot of pressure on it. Fairuza Balk's performance as Paula is certainly more than a match for the standard that her fellow actresses have set.
This portion is all about the moment of intense self-examination that comes after surviving a catastrophe, and Paula's entire existence becomes a question mark. Running away from a tumultuous relationship, she's pulled into a new one with a young hitchhiker that forces her to come to grips with her future. Paula's melodrama feels diminutive and slightly unformed, despite Ms. Balk's quicksilver, open, emotional quality.
There aren't many actresses who can communicate fear with such economy, and Ms. Balk's large, bright eyes take in all the details of the horrors in her own life and those nearby. She seems like a war veteran trying to leave behind the recent scars of war, and the tentativeness of her story -- it hesitates and hiccups -- doesn't fit with the actress's own strengths. This segment lacks the air of completion that the preceding minidramas contained. 
The remaining slice also makes us most aware of Ms. Miller's decision to use a narrator. The stories have such a closely held interior narrative that this idea makes sense, and the narration isn't used to explain exactly what's going on in the women's heads but rather to outline their dilemmas. Ms. Miller makes a choice that's sure to rile some; the narrator, John Ventimiglia, is a man. It asks an intriguing question: Do women often hear men's voices inside their heads? And is there something about fathers that frames their lives?
Not much is made of this. It's left to the audience to have its own discussions. Ms. Miller's thoughtful, vibrating sensibility will also provoke discussions afterward. Even when the movie is over, the psychological physics of "Personal Velocity" will remain in your head.
"Personal Velocity" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language and sexuality.

HEADLINE: DRIVING; 
My Gasoline Beats Yours (Doesn't It?)

BYLINE:  By GEORGE P. BLUMBERG 

 BODY:
EVERYONE knows the woman who buys only Mobil, or the man who drives five miles and passes 10 gas stations to get to the BP pump.
 And everyone knows the driver who brags that he will only fill up at the cheapest station in town -- and always knows which one it is. 
 Some of us also know the tomato-tomahto couple who can't agree: one partner is fastidious about gasoline, demanding only a particular brand; the other would rather get it at Wal-Mart and save a couple of dollars for coffee.
So, who is right? Does the driver who insists on a higher-priced brand of gasoline guard his automobile from decay and disruption? Or is he a chump, falling for empty marketing slogans? 
Ah, if the question were only that simple. Yes, there are differences in brands of gasoline, but then again, there aren't. What's safe is a two-part conclusion. All gasoline sold in the United States is basically the same stuff, mingled near the distribution point in the same gigantic tanks, and it is all of good quality. But when the gasoline rivers branch off to be pumped into separate trucks, companies tinker with it, taking that consistently good product (whether regular or premium) and spicing it with their own chemical signatures, the additives that they claim set them apart. The resulting differences are hardly major ones, but if you're an aficionado tuned to your engine's every ping, you may care about them.
Michael Scardino of Brentwood, Tenn., a 52-year-old advertising creative director, said his cars ran better on Chevron and added, "I'd go out of my way to get it." But when the brand is Shell, he said, "I'm never happy with the performance." He also switches periodically between Chevron, Citgo, Exxon and Texaco "to get the additives from one that may be missing in another brand," he said.
Meanwhile, Laura Brengleman, 41, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., and is the editor of the motorcycle magazine RoadBike, puts the cheapest gas she can find in her family car, which has rolled up 150,000 miles so far. "I have no problem buying from a no-name gas outlet," she said, "as long as I see it's a busy station with turnover." (When a station goes through its gasoline supply quickly, there's less potential for water to condense from the air and settle into half-empty tanks.) On the road, Ms. Brengleman said, she might look for Exxon because she counts on its restrooms to be clean.
It sounds as if this brand issue is one for the experts. But they're not much help.
"I can't say one brand is better than another," said Dr. Edward Murphy, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group that represents oil companies in Washington. "Base gas is a freely traded commodity that must meet certain government specifications. It flows through common pipelines into commingled storage tanks." What he could say, he added, is that "the major brands spend R-and-D money on patented additives, which they add to the basic gas."
Ron Baker, the director of the Petroleum Extension Service of the University of Texas at Austin, is well informed on these additives, which are the true distinguishing elements of gasoline brands. He described them as "detergents and other chemicals" designed to keep gasoline from evaporating, keep engines from corroding, help engines run well in different climates and seasons, and keep engines clean. The goal, he added, is "forming less deposits when the gasoline burns, for better mileage, performance and exhaust emissions." So which brand does Mr. Baker choose? "I buy cheap gas," he said. "All U.S. gas is of good quality."
Gabriel Shenhar, the senior auto test engineer for Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, has experience that ought to make him a determined scoffer at brand preference. "We tried to conduct tests a few years ago to measure the differences in acceleration and fuel economy of different gasoline brands," he said. "We bagged the test, because any differences we found were not greater than those you find day to day caused by changing air temperatures or humidity." But in his private life Mr. Shenhar is partial to Sunoco Ultra 94, which he says works best for him in performance and economy.
About 36 percent of adult gasoline users are loyal to one brand or another, said Robert Pasikoff, the president of Brand Keys, a Manhattan brand consulting firm. That leaves 64 percent to be lured into stations by low prices or special promotions.
Perhaps these uncommitted consumers are overwhelmed by the sheer number of brands -- "a couple of hundred," according to Trilby Lundberg, an analyst responsible for the Lundberg Survey, which tracks daily prices and sales at the nation's gas stations.
"Sunoco is big in New York and Pennsylvania, but not in the West at all," Ms. Lundberg said. "The 76 brand is huge all over the West but not on the East Coast." Amoco (now BP at many stations), unknown in Texas, is the top-selling gasoline in the New York metropolitan area. 
"At our Little Rock terminal we store and distribute gasoline for many major brands," said Oakley Bohannon, national accounts director of the Truman Arnold Companies of Texarkana, Tex., a major gasoline distributor. "All the gasoline taps off the same Texas Eastern pipeline, then goes into commingled 150,000-barrel tanks." The distinctive additives go in as tank trucks are filled; the brands acquire their differences just before the gasoline is taken to stations. "If it's a load for Shell stations," Mr. Bohannon said, "the pump injects the Shell additive package with a measured squirt into every 40 gallons of gas."
ALL gasoline has additives. For unbranded gasolines, like those sold at low-cost outlets, the additive is a generic version that meets minimum federal standards, and the ratio is about a third of a gallon of additive to every 1,000 gallons of gasoline. 
Gasoline companies aren't telling what's in their unique additive packages; they are closely held and patented secrets. But whether these details even make a difference to a driver is an open question. "The majors claim they go beyond the federal standard in formulating their additives," Mr. Bohannon said. "I can't argue that, but it's a mystery to me if it's better, and I'm not sure what it practically means. I've sold billions of gallons of unbranded gas over the years, and it has never been a problem."
Major brands tout their own additives while vaguely denigrating one another's. Chevron, whose additive is acknowledged as the most expensive, says it keeps combustion chambers free of deposits while "some of" its competitors' additives will actually increase these deposits. Dave Harvey, the developer of Citgo's additives, says his creation includes a corrosion inhibitor and a de-emulsifier that "others" don't have. Sunoco says its additives perform "above the minimum levels" in cleaning up intake valves and fuel injectors. Shell claims its formula keeps intake valves clean while an unnamed "convenience store gas" damages them.
"The consumer has to take on faith what's in the pump" said Mr. Baker, the University of Texas extension director.
So what gas do his colleagues use? "I took an informal poll of staff at the University of Texas Petroleum Extension Service and asked which brand of gas they think is best," Mr. Baker said. "They all threw up their hands and shrugged their shoulders."
The tomato-tomahto couple may as well just keep arguing.

OCTANE
Premium or Regular? Ask Your Car
GASOLINE brands may be mysterious, but the difference in grades of gasoline -- between regular and whatever kinds of premium a station offers -- is straightforward. Gasoline is graded by octane number, which rates its resistance to premature ignition, or engine knocking. Regular gas has an octane rating of 87, a medium grade is 89, and premium gasolines begin at 91 and go up. Higher-performance cars generally need higher octane. Racecars use a grade of over 100, which you won't find at your local station.
The differences in octane number originate in chemical mixtures created at the refinery, and different grades of gasoline are kept separate throughout the distribution process. The right grade to buy is the one your particular car was engineered for; you need to use only a grade high enough to prevent knock. "Putting premium in a car designed to run on lower octane is a waste of money," said Dennis Simanaitis, the engineering editor of Road and Track magazine.
Using regular in a car designed for premium, however, is a mistake. "If a car is rated to run on premium, it will still run on 87 or 89, but the engine computer will dial back its performance and you won't get optimum performance or gas mileage," Mr. Simanaitis said. In that kind of car, "using premium fuel will eliminate the knock," he added, "and the engine computer will deliver full performance."
So which grade of gasoline is right for your car? Look in your owner's manual.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
A Show Bursting Out

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
SCHEDULING shows at the Metropolitan Museum is like regulating airline takeoffs at Thanksgiving. The queue is long; establishing priorities is a delicate business; the competition for prime runway space is fierce.
 The museum's curators of African art have sidestepped all the fuss in "Genesis: Ideas of Origin in African Sculpture." Rather than wait for one of the deluxe showcase galleries to be free, they've cleared out a piece of their home turf, the Michael C. Rockefeller Wing, and mounted the splendid if compact show there. 
 Even with Daniel Kershaw's ingeniously permeable installation, the space feels small for so large an art. But I always feel this way about African art in museums; to me it looks uncontainable, irrepressible, pressurized to the point of explosion. The impression comes from the physicality of work that is constantly reaching out and pulling in, opening and closing, contrasting light and dark, rough and smooth. It is also a product of conceptual activity that is practical, radical and nonstop. 
The art in the Met's show, from more than a dozen African cultures, does these things:
*It proposes rigorously ethical models for political leadership and a universal etiquette of patience and self-restraint.
*It promotes physical and psychological healing and establishes diplomatic ties with the afterlife.
*For the average person, it shapes a stimulating vision of the here and now by inventing forms that don't exist and reflecting forms that do, so that everyday life feels both exotic and reassuringly familiar.
*Through an exercise of immense wit -- no art is more entertaining -- and moral gravity, it records history, the record of where we came from and where we may be going.
History is the theme of the show, which has been organized by Alisa LaGamma, an associate curator at the museum. Divided into four sections, the first on the creation of the world and mankind, it opens with a heart-melting sight in the form of an eight-inch-tall terra-cotta head of a young woman, made between the 12th and 14th centuries in the city of Ile-Ife in what is now Nigeria.
According to Yoruba myth, Ile-Ife was the birthplace of the first humans, black and white, who were sculptured from clay by the artist-god Obatala, or by the supreme creator Oduduwa, who fashioned the continents. Either would have been proud of modeling this young woman's comely face, scored with undulant lines like flowing water and glowing with serene self-confidence.
To the same degree that early Nigerian naturalism falls comfortably on the Western eye, the Adam and Eve figures carved from wood by a Senufo sculptor in Ivory Coast or Mali present challenges and excitements. Nearly four feet tall with broad shoulders and wedge-shaped heads, their bodies taut with held-in energy, their skin glowing as if filled with sap, they are tremendous and tender things, complementary emblems of the difference-in-sameness balance that keeps the universe in motion.
Once human beings arrived on earth, power politics inevitably followed, and explanations of how government, enlightened or otherwise, came to be is the subject of the show's next section. The story told by the ceremonial masks of the Kuba people of Congo includes an incestuous romance. One mask, encrusted with cowrie shells, represents the first Kuba king. Another personifies his sister, by whom he had children. She is depicted with a strip of beadwork covering her mouth like a seal and her cheeks streaked with painted lines that might be tears.
Luba kingship, by contrast, had more decorous origins. It began with the appearance of a foreign hunter-prince, the young and dashing Mbidi Kiluwe, who established order in an unruly world and whose son, Kalala Ilunga, initiated a dynastic line. To reaffirm this lineage, each new ruler is equipped with a set of ceremonial objects modeled on Kalala Ilunga's, including a staff of office, a bow stand, an abstract map of Luba history known as a memory board and a divination bowl.
The bowl at the Met is attributed to the so-called Buli Master, a 19th-century artist who was the subject of the first special exhibition organized in the Rockefeller wing, in 1980. It is carved in the shape of a woman holding a hollowed-out calabash to be filled with objects used to extract information from the spirit world. With her grave, downcast face and her body curved over the bowl as if to protect it, she makes a stirring figure, not only as a brilliantly realized sculpture but also, as Ms. LaGamma writes in her exhibition catalog, as a "profound commentary on the human spirit's desire to obtain knowledge and influence the course of history."
Family genealogy is also preserved and celebrated through art. For the Fang people of Cameroon, the reverence for lineage focuses on the bones and ashes of forebears. Thought to insure fertility and the safe birth of children, the relics are kept in special containers and guarded by carved ancestor figures with pudgy, infantile bodies and vigilant adult faces.
The Baga people of Guinea express clan or family identity through masks and headdresses based on stylized, hyperbolic animal, bird and insect forms. A butterfly mask has an eight-foot wing span; two very different masks represent serpents, one as tall as a tree and as thin as a spear, the other a thick, sinuously curving column patterned with Harlequin-like black, red and white diamonds. Together they suggest an intense but objective intimacy with the natural world, of the kind hinted at by the social anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss when he described finding answers to the most complex existential questions in "the brief glance, heavy with patience, serenity and mutual forgiveness that, through some involuntary understanding, one can sometimes exchange with a cat."
This sense of identification, or connectedness, is highly developed in the carved Ci Wara antelope headdresses of the Bamana people of Mali. This sculptural type has long been an emblem for African art and culture internationally. Mali's national airline uses it as a logo. The 40 examples gathered from American collections for the Met show add up to an optical coup de theatre, as a similar ensemble did in "Bamana: The Art of Existence in Mali" at the Museum for African Art last year.
The revelation in that earlier exhibition, re-emphasized at the Met, lay not in how consistent a particular form could remain through many repetitions but in how inventive it could be. Ci Wara is the name of the mythical Bamana hero who introduced agriculture and gave humans a knowledge of plants and animals. It is also the name of the agricultural fraternity that stages masked performances in his honor, and finally of the masks or headdresses themselves, which are composite images of several animals, including antelopes, anteaters and birds.
The show has textbook examples of the sculpture, including male and female pairs. With their squat bodies, beaklike snouts and tapering horns, they share basic features, though the male is distinguished by his windblown mane and the female by the fawn she carries on her back. The variations on these classic types and on the subgenre of horizontally oriented headdresses called n'gonzon koun are astonishing: stripped-down or elaborate, realistic or abstract, changing from place to place, artist to artist. In some cases, the shape is dictated by whether a headdress is created for religious ceremonies or popular entertainment, though often forms and functions are interchangeable.
The Met's installation thrillingly conveys the virtuosity in just this one example of the countless types of sub-Saharan sculpture. What the show cannot do, of course, is fully convey the kinetic dimension of this performance-based art, which is fundamental to how it was imagined and how it appeared to its intended audience.
This is a recurrent issue with museum displays of objects that do not neatly correspond to the Western concepts of art. And while we may have grown tired of revisiting the problem, it remains important, a matter of seeing clearly. Like the bronze temple figures of Hindu gods from South India, displayed in the Met's Asian galleries and assembled en masse in a glorious show at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington this fall, the Ci Wara sculptures achieve their ultimate meaning in movement and as part of a dynamic environment. In public processions, the Indian images exchange glances with their devotees; this interaction gives them life. When the Ci Wara headdresses are worn by acrobatic singers and dancers, the sculptures as much as the performers are seen as vivacious.
Ms. LaGamma, thoroughly alert to all of this, has included a fascinating compilation of filmed Ci Wara performances in the exhibition, many of them shot by the art historian and collector Pascal James Imperato. They are given far more prominence than in any Met show I have seen before, and this is good. They may be no substitute for being there when an organic, process-based form of African art is danced to completion, but they are just the right finishing, amplifying touch to an economically executed, grandly conceived show.

"Genesis: Ideas of Origin in African Sculpture" remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 Fifth Avenue, at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through April 13.

HEADLINE: INSIDE ART 

BYLINE:  By Carol Vogel 

 BODY:
The Morgan On Loan
 Many of the financier J. P. Morgan's favorite medieval artworks -- the ones that he kept in his private study until his death in 1913 and that have since been housed at the Pierpont Morgan Library -- recently went on view in the Medieval Tapestry Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where they will stay for at least two and a half years while the Morgan undergoes a $100 million expansion. 
 "These are objects that will stop people in their tracks," said Peter Barnet, the curator in charge of medieval art at the Met and the Cloisters. "Some of them are among the best Morgan had." Mr. Barnet admits that even the Met's collections don't have examples as complete or as extraordinary. 
Among the best is the Stavelot Triptych from the Abbey of Stavelot in Belgium, made in the 12th century to hold fragments of the True Cross. Incorporating enamel, silver and precious stones, the triptych is considered a masterpiece of medieval goldsmith work, Mr. Barnet said. Its centerpiece is a smaller Byzantine triptych made of cloisonne enamel on gold where the relic of the cross has been placed. "We have wonderful enamels, but almost no museum has a work as complete as this," Mr. Barnet said.
Also on view is the gold and jeweled binding of the Lindau Gospel Book. The front cover, created in the court workshop of the ninth-century Emperor Charles the Bald, grandson of Charlemagne, has finely worked gold, star sapphires, garnets, emeralds, pearls and other stones.
"Many of these pieces were difficult to see at the Morgan because of the way some of the objects were displayed in the study, which is maintained as a period room," Mr. Barnet said. "Here we have three well-lit, free-standing cases."
Other treasures from the Morgan will soon go into storage. On Dec. 4 the McKim building that houses Morgan's original library will close to the public, and the other two buildings will close on May 4. The entire library is to reopen in early 2006.
"We've just completed the design-development phase," said Charles E. Pierce Jr., director of the Morgan. "Despite the economy we feel the time is right for the institution to go forward."
So far the Morgan has raised around $62 million for the project, which is budgeted at $100 million for the building and $25 million for an endowment to support library operations.
The expansion, designed by Renzo Piano, includes a new reading room; more gallery space; a larger, modernized auditorium; improved circulation; and a more welcoming entrance. "The design is completely program driven," Mr. Pierce added.
When the library closes, its staff will move elsewhere in Manhattan to a site not yet determined, Mr. Pierce said. Meanwhile, the Morgan still plans to offer some programs -- lectures, concerts and other educational programs -- in a temporary site that it will announce soon. The library is also organizing six to eight traveling exhibitions.

After the spectacular $76.7 million -- a record for an old master painting at auction -- paid for Rubens's "Massacre of the Innocents" (1609-11) at Sotheby's in London in July, many in the art world wondered if the public would ever have a chance to see this extraordinary painting again. This week the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto announced that Lord Thomson of Fleet, the former owner of The Times of London and one of the richest men in Canada, has promised this painting along with nearly 2,000 other works in his collection to the gallery after it completes a $315 million renovation and expansion.
The California architect Frank Gehry has been chosen to design the expansion of the gallery's 1911 building, to be completed in 2007. Plans include adding about 40 percent more gallery space, 75,000 square feet. Lord Thomson is contributing $44 million to the project. Federal and provincial governments are giving $30 million and the rest will come from private donors, gallery officials said.
"This gift is going to make us a very different museum," said Matthew Teitelbaum, its director. "The Rubens, along with related works on paper, will tell the story of the high point of the Baroque. In addition, his collection of European works of art is thought to be one of the finest formed within the last 30 years. It will become an important focus for study." The gift also includes a collection of 19th-century Canadian art.
The gallery has housed 300 works from Lord Thomson's collection since 1997.

A Dallas Skybox
When the Nasher Sculpture Center opens in Dallas in October, it will not only showcase works by artists like Picasso and de Kooning, Moore and Robert Smithson from the real estate developer Raymond D. Nasher's own collection, but also have a site-specific piece commissioned by the installation artist James Turrell. The work, "Tending (Blue)," is one of Mr. Turrell's free-standing "Skyspaces," enclosed spaces that are free-standing structures like rooms open to the sky through rectangular or rounded holes in the roof. Each is large enough for viewers to enter; many have benches so visitors can sit inside them and concentrate on the sky.
"Tending (Blue)," to be placed at one end of the garden, will be a cube measuring 26 by 26 by 26 feet on the outside and 22 by 22 by 22 feet on the inside with a black granite exterior, limestone benches and white plaster walls. It will be able to hold 20 to 25 people. Unlike Mr. Turrell's other "Skyspaces," this one will have both air conditioning and heating so it can be used year round.
"I'm hoping this will be a magnet," Mr. Nasher said. "Turrell is a very exciting artist." Before commissioning the work, he said, he visited many of the artist's installations, including "Roden Crater," Mr. Turrell's project to reshape an extinct volcano near Flagstaff, Ariz. "Everything else in the garden will either be pieces purchased or part of the collection," Mr. Nasher added. "This will be the first Turrell in Dallas."

Off to Buffalo
Louis Grachos, director of Site Santa Fe, a New Mexico contemporary arts center, since 1996, has been named director of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo. Mr. Grachos will succeed Douglas G. Schultz, who is retiring after 30 years at the museum, 19 of them as director. Mr. Grachos is to start on Jan. 21.

Condo Conflict: Fighting Away In Margaritaville

BYLINE:  By JASON TANZ 

 BODY:
STAN RABER works two jobs -- he is the night manager at the Blue Lagoon Motel and an assistant manager at a Circle K convenience store -- to afford his condominium in Truman Annex, a lushly landscaped, 47-acre planned development on the western edge of Key West, Fla. But about three times a week, when he gets home at 7:30 a.m. after working his shift at the Blue Lagoon, he takes a few minutes to walk around the parking lot and write down the license numbers and models of cars he doesn't recognize. Then he arranges that data into a table, cross-indexed by date and parking space. He converts the information into list form and faxes it to the city's code enforcement division. 
 Mr. Raber is determined to rid Truman Annex of an element he is convinced is despoiling his corner of paradise: vacationers who rent a condo from an absent owner and treat the complex's pool as an oversize Jacuzzi and its meticulously groomed grounds as their private playpen. 
 Mr. Raber isn't alone in his anger. The conflict between full-time residents, many of them retirees, and the part-timers who occasionally rent out their homes, has turned this Key West development into a hotbed of controversy over the last couple of years, complete with police investigations, several lawsuits and more than a hundred claims against the city by second-home owners who contend that their freedoms are being trampled.
"It's the most intense issue we've ever dealt with in this city," said Tom Oosterhoudt, a city commissioner. "It's maddening."
All planned developments have, of course, a potential for conflict, as they bring together people who may share little more than a ZIP code. But residential complexes in vacation towns -- in which the residents are typically split between full-timers and second-home owners -- are particularly vulnerable to strife. Each side may have sharply conflicting needs and habits, incomes and ideas of what constitutes a good time.
"You get a tug-of-war of priorities," said Tom Hindman, a lawyer in Wheat Ridge, Colo., who sees these conflicts regularly in his work with homeowners' associations in Vail and Aspen. "The owner who is off site doesn't care about the loud music or the guy who brings the pet with him. So what if somebody had a party out in the pool? They're motivated by the income. But the person who is living there every day is concerned about the quality of life."
Perhaps it's not too surprising that a particularly bitter fight has broken out in Key West, which has long been a study in contrasts. The Victorian showplaces of the moneyed class in Old Town sit just blocks from Mallory Square, where beer-drinking crowds gather each evening to watch the sunset in Margaritaville. 
Paradoxically, short-term rentals, the very issue that has Mr. Raber and some of his neighbors so incensed, is an issue that the City of Key West has tried to regulate. "Transient renting" for less than a month requires a special license, and all the available licenses have been allocated since 1996. Myriad legal challenges to the law are now wending their way through the courts. 
But by all accounts, the battle, which extends throughout Key West, is particularly heated within Truman Annex. Some homeowners argue that because it is a private development, Truman Annex is exempt from the city's rules. Others argue that Truman Annex's own regulations forbid short-term rentals, a claim the pro-rental faction denies. Whatever the case, to hear many full-timers tell it, homeowners are continuing to rent out their units for a tidy profit. 
To all outward appearances, Truman Annex -- named after Harry S. Truman, whose Little White House, now a museum open to the public, is within the complex -- seems a vision of serenity. Beyond the sentry post on Southard Street, T-shirted guards bike through the tree-lined lanes, past the 270 single-family detached homes and upscale two-story condos. The Shipyards, the 183-unit condo development where Mr. Raber lives, has its own gate and board of directors, but it shares the same sense of calm.
In 1999, Truman Annex seemed perfect to Martha and Henry duPont. Tired of feeling inundated by rowdy spring breakers and drunken revelers who show up every October for Fantasy Fest, the duPonts sold their house in the Old Town section of Key West and moved into a large house in the annex. But its gates, it turned out, were no protection against the tourists.
"I had moved into a hornet's nest," Ms. duPont said. The first sign of trouble came before she had even moved in. Her daughter, staying in the house for the summer, called her mother to tell her that "you've got some people living behind you that like to throw some pretty wild parties."
Once Ms. duPont settled in, she noticed unfamiliar faces every week. These guests always said they were relatives or friends of the homeowners, but Ms. duPont was suspicious. Then she learned from a friend that he had rented a house there for a week. Seven months later she hired Lee Rohe, a local lawyer, to bring a suit to end the short-term rentals once and for all.
"There was testimony in the hearing about drunken orgies, sex at the pool," Mr. Rohe said. "One guy almost punched out a homeowner when he tried to quiet them down. Just a lot of crazy stuff."
Truman Annex wasn't always this way, said Angela Dell'Amore, a 67-year-old retired clinical social worker. Ms. Dell'Amore and her husband, John, bought their two-bedroom Shipyards condo in 1991, shortly after the complex opened. Back then, she said, she was surrounded by fellow homeowners, either full-time residents or part-time owners like herself who returned every chance they got. 
In the winter months, a group of 25 residents would meet by the pool for wine and cheese. "There was a real sense of community," she said. 
When the Shipyards opened, there was a limit, tied to the inflation rate, on resale prices, but by the late 1990's, the five-year restrictions were expiring. Homeowners were suddenly able to sell their units at great profit, and many of them did. Real estate agents snapped up five or six at a time and began to rent them. In the next few years, Ms. Dell'Amore said, her neighborhood began to change. 
"We've had people pour wine into the pool until the water turned red," Ms. Dell'Amore said. "Saturdays here are unbelievable. The cleaning people come. You hear rolling luggage everywhere."
Jerry Coleman, a director of one of the annex homeowners' associations, is a lawyer who represents a real estate company and more than a hundred pro-rental homeowners. He contends that some of the complaints about renters' behavior are overblown. "I hear it, but I don't believe it," he said. "This is a small group of busybodies that want to tell people what they can do in their own homes."
B USYBODIES or not, lately they have been very busy indeed. Fed up with what they saw as a blindly pro-rental board of directors, last year some residents organized under the name of Truman Annex Residents Inc., a nonprofit group. Last April, the group packed a City Commission hearing, at which dozens of people spoke out, demanding that the city begin enforcing its ban on unlicensed transient rentals.
Meanwhile, in the Shipyards, Ms. Dell'Amore and Mr. Raber have been patrolling the parking lots and filing reports with the city's code enforcement division -- at the city's request, they say -- every time they suspect that a unit has been rented to a short-term guest. In one six-week period, Ms. Dell'Amore filed 60 complaints.
In May, the city sent in code enforcement officers. John Bollinger, a Shipyards condo owner who has rented his unit, says that he received several phone calls from other angry owners that day: "I got complaints from owners that code enforcement was knocking on doors, asking for documentation why they were there. They said: 'This is like Nazi Germany! We don't want to be harassed in our homes.' " 
Bob Tischenkel, Key West's city attorney, said that the code enforcement division was just doing its job. "Private property owners are always slightly offended," he said. "This is nothing unusual." 
Now the homeowners who have complained about the rentals say it is they who feel harassed. Mr. Raber said that a neighbor challenged him to a fight at a homeowners' association meeting. Bill Estes, another Shipyards owner, said that he put a small cabinet on his porch years ago. As soon as he started agitating against transient rentals, he said, the homeowners' association told him he was violating deed restrictions and demanded that he remove it.
Ms. Dell'Amore said she had started receiving vaguely threatening letters in the mail as well as dozens of unsolicited magazine subscriptions. "It's hard not to feel paranoid," she said. 
Today, the city's enforcement efforts are, for the most part, in abeyance until the various legal maneuvers are concluded. Mr. Coleman, the lawyer and homeowner, and others are challenging the legality of the transient rental ordinance in county court. They have also filed claims against the city, contending that they are being denied rental income and demanding reimbursement.
Meanwhile, Mr. Raber says that once he gets home, he rarely goes outside. "We are relegated to living within our four walls," he said, "because to do anything else makes us uncomfortable and distressed."

HEADLINE: Russian Palladium Producer Investing in Montana Mines 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
Norilsk Nickel, the producer of palladium and nickel, said today that it had agreed to acquire a majority stake in the Stillwater Mining Company of Columbus, Mont.
 Norilsk, which is controlled by companies linked to the powerful Russian businessman Vladimir O. Potanin, has agreed to pay $341 million -- $100 million in cash and the rest in the form of about 876,000 ounces of palladium -- or about $7.50 a share for a 51 percent stake in Stillwater, the only American producer of palladium and platinum. 
 Investors, apparently unhappy with the price, bid down Stillwater shares by as much as 15 percent on the news, but the shares later recovered somewhat to close down 38 cents, at $7.03 a share. 
Norilsk said that buying the stake in Stillwater will help it dispose of a large inventory of palladium, a precious metal related to platinum and gold that is used mainly in making automotive catalytic converters. 
Norilsk's sales have been sluggish lately because, after years of erratic deliveries caused in part by Russian government red tape, users of the metal have cushioned themselves by creating their own stockpiles, and now have less need to buy new metal, according to Vasily Nikolaev of Troika Dialog, a Moscow-based investment bank. 
Only one other Russian company has acquired control of a sizable American business since Communism fell: Lukoil, Russia's largest oil producer, bought a chain of Getty Petroleum gas stations in 2000 for $71 million. But many cash-rich Russian companies, in particular the oil producers, have been extending their reach westward in other ways, buying refineries and other assets in Ukraine, Bulgaria and Romania. 
Norilsk will use Stillwater's marketing arm to sell its palladium in North America, by far the most important market for cars and catalytic converters. About 70 percent of the world's palladium production goes into cars, Mr. Nikolaev said.
"Strategically, it's probably a smart move to get this kind of access to U.S. consumers," said Mr. Nikolaev, referring to industrial users of the metal. Still, he said, "the problem is not only lack of trust in Norilsk as a supplier, but also weak demand."
Over the last two years, in part because of the difficulties in getting regular deliveries from Russia, and the stockpiling and searches for substitutes that followed, palladium prices have been quite weak. From a peak of $1,100 an ounce in January 2001, when it was much more expensive than platinum, palladium now sells for about $282 an ounce in the spot market. 
Norilsk's deal for Stillwater begins a new stage in Russia's development as a market economy, said Peter Boone, head of research at Brunswick UBS Warburg in Moscow. As its economy grows and its international credit ratings improve, Russia's companies are getting access to more financing at lower rates, Mr. Boone said.
"The writing is on the wall," he said. "Russians are going to be buying companies abroad."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Britain Urge India To Shed State-Owned Assets 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HYDERABAD, India, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
Senior American and British officials touring India today called on the Indian government to scale back its role in the domestic economy, which has lagged behind China in growth.
 Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said here in southern India today that the country needed stronger legal protections for businesses, which are often vulnerable to sharp swings in regulation or political sentiment. Mr. O'Neill said the Indian economy was attracting only one-tenth the volume of foreign investment now going to China. 
 In Bombay, 600 miles to the west, Britain's chief Treasury secretary, Paul Boateng, said the Indian government should persist in its efforts to sell state-owned enterprises, a process that has been plagued with delays and disputes. Mr. Boateng offered to provide the advice and expertise of the British government, which has considerable recent experience with privatization. He urged India to rein in its chronic budget deficits, which now run to 5 percent of national economic output.
An Indian government minister, reached at home, declined to respond to the remarks. Since throwing off colonial rule, India has been very wary of anything that might smack of foreign interference in its affairs.
Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Boateng are both in India for a meeting of ministers from the Group of 20 developing countries. Attendees are scheduled to attend a dinner in New Delhi Friday night and then spend Saturday in private talks.
The developing countries are expected to call for more foreign aid, something that the Bush administration has promised to try to provide, although not on a scale large enough to satisfy critics.
India's growth rate, while healthy at 6 percent, has not matched China's double-digit rates of the 1990's or its 8 percent rate now. Because China's population is not growing as fast as India's, it has opened an even wider lead in growth of income per person.
A few cities in southern India have boomed by attracting high-technology companies, notably here and Bangalore. But business is stagnating elsewhere, especially in northern and eastern states where local governments still set very detailed regulations.
For India to match its great rival, China, it must emphasize "the fundamentals," Mr. O'Neill said, citing "the rule of law, having contracts that are enforced and fighting corruption."
Mr. O'Neill politely made no mention in his brief remarks to reporters here, nor in the prepared text of the speech he is to deliver on Friday to Indian and American executives in New Delhi, of his personal experience with India's regulatory ways.
In the past, Mr. O'Neill has said that when he was chief executive of Alcoa, he tried to set up a big aluminum smelting operation in India. But the project was ultimately abandoned, he said, in part because of a dispute over whether legally binding contracts could be reached to cover the venture's activities.

HEADLINE: Car Models and Models Vie for Attentionat Seoul Show 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
The latest Korean car models were on display, but the flesh-and-blood models stole the spotlight as the Seoul Motor Show opened today in a blaze of singing, dancing and hoopla. 
 The dark-suited executives from the country's five carmakers, on hand to extol the technical virtues and glowing sales prospects of the new machines, were no match for the scores of young women in long gowns and miniskirts, in Santa's-helper outfits and sober office wear, hired to lean on hoods and doors, sit behind steering wheels, line up in front of exhibits and pose for snapshot after snapshot. 
 Attractive women draped over the goods have been a staple at trade shows around the world for years, but rarely on the exuberant scale seen here. 
This year's Seoul show features more than 400 models, about half hired by the carmakers and the rest by parts suppliers and other exhibitors. 
Few attendees seemed to question their role in luring visitors to gaze at the gleaming steel evidence of South Korea's rise as an automaker to the world.
No sooner had Nick Reilly and Yu Ki Joon, two top executives of General Motors' recently acquired Korean subsidiary, GM Daewoo Auto and Technology, pulled the cover off the Lacetti, a new Daewoo compact model that went on sale today, than four women in fur-trimmed crimson elf outfits popped out of the front and back seats.
"We hope to manufacture 75,000 of these next year," Mr. Reilly said after posing for photos with Mr. Yu and the elves. "We'll start exporting to Europe and to Australia in about six months. We're still looking at the best time for exporting to the United States, and we're studying China."
At the Hyundai Motor display, the company's president, Kim Dong Jin, predicted that including its Kia subsidiary, which is exhibiting separately at the show, Hyundai will be selling more than five million vehicles a year by 2010, rivaling the Big Three. 
Jerome Stoll, the chief executive of Renault Samsung, was also bubbling with optimistic forecasts for the SM3, a Nissan-derived compact car introduced in September as the company's first new model since Renault took it over two years ago.
"We have some difficulties coping with demand for the car," Mr. Stoll said, struggling to make himself heard as a troupe of singers and dancers behind him performed a song from "Grease." 
He said, the company's only other current car model, the midsize SM5, would turn a profit this year, ahead of schedule.
Even the orphan of the industry, Ssangyong Motor, managed an upbeat mood. The company has been run by its creditors since it nearly went out of business at the height of the Korean economic crisis. Soh Jin Kwan, the president, announced proudly that the company's tiny sales were nonetheless up 48 percent for the year, and that it would soon be profitable again, even though no one seems to want to buy it.
Few seemed to want to talk shop with the executives, either, not amid so much hoopla in the Coex exhibition center. Organizers of the show said that the presence of swarms of models, known as doumi, Korean for "people who serve," was an intrinsic element in the success of any Korean trade show.
"They are very important," said Lee Young Duk of the Korea Automobile Manufacturers' Association. "They are beautiful. People come here to see them."
They play a symbolic role as well, said Mr. Lee, who seemed surprised that a reporter would even ask why they were there. "If a small parts supplier has no money, they might not be able to pay for duomi," he said. "If a company has no money, nobody will go there." 
At the G.M. Daewoo display, Jeo Jung Yeon, smiling as she opened the front door of a Lacetti, spoke of the motor show as a high point of a duomi's year. "This show is the best job," Miss Jeo said. Hired freelance through an agent, she said she made about $120 a day at the show, alternating hours of work and rest from morning to night for 10 days.
Her partner, Lee Min A, was not quite so enthusiastic. "Usually we'll wear the same costume for the whole week," she said, adding that she would rather be in sequined dresses, like the duomi at some other displays. But whatever she wears, "it's hard work, and sometimes people are rude."

HEADLINE: The Sons Also Rise 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
America, we all know, is the land of opportunity. Your success in life depends on your ability and drive, not on who your father was.
 Just ask the Bush brothers. Talk to Elizabeth Cheney, who holds a specially created State Department job, or her husband, chief counsel of the Office of Management and Budget. Interview Eugene Scalia, the top lawyer at the Labor Department, and Janet Rehnquist, inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services. And don't forget to check in with William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, and the conservative commentator John Podhoretz. 
 What's interesting is how little comment, let alone criticism, this roll call has occasioned. It might be just another case of kid-gloves treatment by the media, but I think it's a symptom of a broader phenomenon: inherited status is making a comeback. 
It has always been good to have a rich or powerful father. Last week my Princeton colleague Alan Krueger wrote a column for The Times surveying statistical studies that debunk the mythology of American social mobility. "If the United States stands out in comparison with other countries," he wrote, "it is in having a more static distribution of income across generations with fewer opportunities for advancement." And Kevin Phillips, in his book "Wealth and Democracy," shows that robber-baron fortunes have been far more persistent than legend would have it. 
But the past is only prologue. According to one study cited by Mr. Krueger, the heritability of status has been increasing in recent decades. And that's just the beginning. Underlying economic, social and political trends will give the children of today's wealthy a huge advantage over those who chose the wrong parents.
For one thing, there's more privilege to pass on. Thirty years ago the C.E.O. of a major company was a bureaucrat -- well paid, but not truly wealthy. He couldn't give either his position or a large fortune to his heirs. Today's imperial C.E.O.'s, by contrast, will leave vast estates behind -- and they are often able to give their children lucrative jobs, too. More broadly, the spectacular increase in American inequality has made the gap between the rich and the middle class wider, and hence more difficult to cross, than it was in the past. 
Meanwhile, one key doorway to upward mobility -- a good education system, available to all -- has been closing. More and more, ambitious parents feel that a public school education is a dead end. It's telling that Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney analyst, apparently sold his soul not for personal wealth but for two places in the right nursery school. Alas, most American souls aren't worth enough to get the kids into the 92nd Street Y. 
Also, the heritability of status will be mightily reinforced by the repeal of the estate tax -- a prime example of the odd way in which public policy and public opinion have shifted in favor of measures that benefit the wealthy, even as our society becomes increasingly class-ridden.
It wasn't always thus. The influential dynasties of the 20th century, like the Kennedys, the Rockefellers and, yes, the Sulzbergers, faced a public suspicious of inherited position; they overcame that suspicion by demonstrating a strong sense of noblesse oblige, justifying their existence by standing for high principles. Indeed, the Kennedy legend has a whiff of Bonnie Prince Charlie about it; the rightful heirs were also perceived as defenders of the downtrodden against the powerful.
But today's heirs feel no need to demonstrate concern for those less fortunate. On the contrary, they are often avid defenders of the powerful against the downtrodden. Mr. Scalia's principal personal claim to fame is his crusade against regulations that protect workers from ergonomic hazards, while Ms. Rehnquist has attracted controversy because of her efforts to weaken the punishment of health-care companies found to have committed fraud.
The official ideology of America's elite remains one of meritocracy, just as our political leadership pretends to be populist. But that won't last. Soon enough, our society will rediscover the importance of good breeding, and the vulgarity of talented upstarts. 
For years, opinion leaders have told us that it's all about family values. And it is -- but it will take a while before most people realize that they meant the value of coming from the right family.

HEADLINE: Key Company Assets Moving Offshore 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
American companies have been rapidly shifting some of their most valuable assets to tax havens, where they pay little or no tax on profits, government data show.
 Instead of moving their headquarters offshore, many companies are simply placing patents on drugs, ownership of corporate logos, techniques for manufacturing processes and other intangible assets in tax havens, tax lawyers say. 
 The companies then charge their subsidiaries in higher-tax locales, including the United States, for the use of these intellectual properties. This allows the companies to take profits in the havens and pay far less in taxes. 
From 1983 to 1999 the value of American corporations' assets in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and 11 other tax havens grew 44 percent more than their assets in Germany, England and other countries with tax rates similar to the United States, Commerce Department data show.
What is more, the havens were given especially lucrative assets, according to an analysis by Martin A. Sullivan, a former Treasury Department economist, published this week in the journal Tax Notes.
The reported profits in tax havens grew far faster than elsewhere. Tax haven profits rose 735 percent, to $92 billion, from 1983 to 1999, while profits in countries that are not tax havens grew only 130 percent, to $114.2 billion.
Bermuda and the other tax havens accounted for 45 percent of the total offshore profits in 1999, but only a fourth of those assets.
Actual taxes paid to the havens ranged from a fraction of 1 percent to 12.5 percent of profits, compared with an effective rate of 35.4 percent in the other countries, the Commerce Department data show.
In all, the 10,000 biggest American companies reported $758 billion in profits worldwide in 1999 and paid taxes to the United States of $154 billion, or 20 percent.
American multinational corporations routinely place ownership of patents, corporate logos and other valuable property in tax havens, said Richard E. Anderson, an international tax lawyer at Arnold & Porter in New York, calling it "international tax planning 101."
"You can't pick up a factory and move it to the Cayman Islands," Mr. Anderson said, "so most of the assets that are going to be relocated as part of a global repositioning are intellectual property. In today's economy that is where most of the profit is. When you buy a pair of sneakers for $250, it's the swoosh symbol, not the rubber" you pay for.
Though a small number of companies have been criticized for trying to move their nominal headquarters to a tax haven, thousands of companies are quietly moving their most valuable assets offshore to escape taxes while keeping their headquarters here, Dr. Sullivan said. The shift allows the companies to both make their domestic operation appear less profitable to the I.R.S. and to take a growing portion of their profits in havens.
A Boston tax lawyer who last summer published a study of assets in tax havens, Avi M. Lev, said that while hard data are not available, "anecdotal evidence suggest that significant intangible assets are beginning to flow offshore."
"The short-term problem is that we are reducing revenues to the United States Treasury from multinational corporations," Mr. Lev said. 
Peter Merrill, chief Washington economist for PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that the surge in tax haven profits could be because valuable assets are being shifted out of the United States. But American companies might also be using new rules adopted during the Clinton administration to shift profits out of foreign countries with higher taxes to tax havens, he said.
As the corporate tax base erodes, the burden of supporting the federal government shifts to individuals. Corporations now generate about a tenth of federal tax revenues, down from about a sixth two decades ago.
For individuals, the portion of their incomes going to taxes rose to 14.8 cents of each dollar in 1999 from 13.1 cents in 1989, according to the Tax Foundation, a group that favors lower taxes.
The tax burden of the 400 highest-income Americans, however, was reduced by more than a fourth by a 1997 tax law. This group, whose average income was $110.5 million in 1998, paid 22 percent of their income in taxes that year, down from 30 percent in 1995, according to an I.R.S. report obtained last year by Professor Joel Slemrod of the University of Michigan.
The Commerce Department figures show that American companies paid 35.4 percent of their offshore profits in taxes in countries that are not tax havens and just 5.8 percent in the 13 tax havens. 
Ingersoll-Rand, Nabors Industries and others that acquired an offshore address in the past year said that high rates of American tax forced them to expatriate. (Federal law gives companies a dollar-for-dollar credit of foreign taxes against the American corporate income tax.)
Before the election, both parties vowed to deny government contracts to companies that acquired an offshore address, a tactic that both Republicans and Democrats denounced as unpatriotic. But after the election, the Republicans reversed course. Republican legislation creating the Homeland Security Department allows such companies to win government contracts if the work is done by an American subsidiary.
The Bush Administration is studying ways to cut corporate taxes further. The Treasury is looking at big ideas, Kenneth Dam, deputy secretary of the Treasury, said at a dinner last week as reported in Tax Notes.
"Corporate tax rate reduction is a big idea," the publication quoted him saying.
Last year, Congress passed a bill allowing companies to quickly write off the cost of new equipment purchased this year and in the next two years. The measure is expected to reduce corporate income taxes by $114 billion over three years, the equivalent of a one-quarter cut in corporate income taxes.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Show a Drop; Decline in Indicators Halts 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
New claims for jobless benefits fell by 25,000 in last week's holiday-shortened workweek to their lowest level since July, the Labor Department reported today. 
 The level of initial claims, which is considered a rough guide to the health of the labor market, slipped to 376,000 in the week ended Nov. 16, from a revised 401,000 in the previous week. That was the lowest since the week ended July 20, when initial claims for jobless benefits totaled 366,000. 
 There was some skepticism, though. "The drop is kind of suspicious, especially given the Veterans Day holiday," said Drew Matus, senior economist at Lehman Brothers. Wall Street economists had forecast new claims at the higher level of 392,000. 
"But the four-week average is moving lower," Mr. Matus said, adding, "It does suggest to us the labor market may have improved slightly."
The drop in new claims pulled the four-week moving average for jobless claims down to 395,750, from 400,250 the previous week. The moving average, considered a more reliable barometer of job market trends because it irons out weekly fluctuations, is at its lowest since August.
In a sign that the pace of hiring may have improved, the report said that the number of people continuing to draw jobless benefits fell to 3.58 million in the week ended Nov. 9, the latest week for which data are available, from 3.64 million the week before. 
In a separate report today, the Conference Board said that the index of leading economic indicators was unchanged in October after a 0.4 percent drop in September. The index, an important forecasting gauge, had fallen for four consecutive months, the board, a New York-based private research group, said. 
"Only consumption has consistently fueled the recovery through the first 10 months of this year," the Conference Board's chief economist, Ken Goldstein, said. "The disappointing employment and output data through October reflect the fragile state of the economy as it enters the holiday season."
The coincident index, which gauges current economic trends, was unchanged in October, as it was in September, and "continues to suggest a recovering yet fragile economy," the board said.

HEADLINE: NASD Says It Plans to Delist Neoforma, Hospital Supplier 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
Neoforma, which operates a Web site where hospitals can order supplies, has been told that it will be delisted by the Nasdaq stock market for failing to report its quarterly financial results on time.
 Neoforma said that it would appeal the NASD's decision and that it expected to file its full financial statements for the third quarter in three weeks. The report is late because the company concluded in October that it had to restate its financial results for 2000, 2001 and the first half of this year. 
 Since 2000, Neoforma has been a close business partner of Novation, a company that negotiates contracts for hospitals to buy medical supplies. Novation's stated mission is to help its 2,500 member hospitals save money. But questions have been raised this year about its business practices and the practices of similar groups.
After a series of articles in The New York Times, inquiries into the way Novation and groups like it do business were begun by a Senate panel; the Federal Trade Commission; and the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer. In August, Novation pledged to change its operations.
Neoforma has said that the financial restatement involves, among other things, the way it accounted for its original operating agreement with Novation and its corporate parents. Earlier this year, the company dismissed Arthur Andersen, the auditor that had approved its accounting methods. The problems surfaced under Novation's new auditor, Deloitte & Touche. 
Neoforma said yesterday that its request for a hearing before the NASD's listing-qualifications panel would allow its stock to continue trading for now. Shares rose $1.73, to $11.73.
In October, Neoforma said its restatement would "have a significant impact" on its revenue until the second half of 2005. It said that after the restatement, revenue for the third quarter of 2002 would be $1.3 million. In the third quarter last year, Neoforma reported $8 million in revenue.
Neoforma has never been profitable. Last year, it reported that it had lost a total of $541 million since its founding in 1996.
Already, hundreds of nonprofit community and university hospitals have been sustaining Neoforma, jointly contributing about $70 million in subsidies, stock purchases and loans to the company. The hospitals own Novation through its corporate parents, VHA Inc. and University HealthSystem Consortium.
Through Novation, the hospitals now own about 60 percent of Neoforma. Novation is also Neoforma's largest customer by far, accounting for about 88 percent of its revenue last year. In addition, officers and directors of Novation and its corporate parents made the decision to extend $70 million to Neoforma. 
The financial assistance has been a sore point with some of Novation's hospitals, whose officers say they were not consulted.
To the further dismay of the hospitals, a number of executives of Novation and its corporate parents owned stock in Neoforma when the financing was approved. They have since sold most of those holdings. 
Executives of Novation and VHA have said they committed the hospitals' money to Neoforma because they believed that hospitals could save money by buying their supplies electronically.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Nasdaq Hits Highest Level In 5 Months; Dow Is Up 222

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
A surge in technology stocks led the market higher yesterday and pushed the Nasdaq composite index to its highest level in five months.
 The buying, which left the three main market gauges up more than 2 percent, could be signaling a new trend in the market, or could be another in the recent mood swings that have sent stocks higher and then lower since summer. 
 Economists generally agree that the economy is slowing toward a 1 percent annual growth rate in the fourth quarter after a 3 percent pace in the third. That realization did not help stocks. 
But now investors have had time to absorb the surprise half-point cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve two weeks ago and assurances since then from Fed officials that they have the tools needed to give the economy another lift, if necessary. So the mood may be turning optimistic again.
Yesterday's surge was set off by the report after the market closed Wednesday that Hewlett-Packard had beaten Wall Street estimates for quarterly sales and profit. Shares of Hewlett-Packard rose 12.7 percent, or $2.14, to $18.99, leading the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index higher.
Technology stocks have been the power behind the equity rebound that began Oct. 9, after the overall market had fallen to its lowest level in five and a half years. The two broad technology sectors in the S.& P. 500 index have climbed more than 38 percent since then.
At the same time, expectations for technology earnings in the fourth-quarter have fallen, driven down largely by the companies themselves. But this has turned out to be a positive development because the lower profit thresholds are more likely to be met or beaten, which is good for the stock prices. Hewlett-Packard's earnings of 24 cents a share beat Wall Street forecasts of 22 cents. Those forecasts had come down from 23 cents on Aug. 1, the beginning of Hewlett-Packard's fourth quarter.
"You have driven down tech prices enormously, and some stocks are now priced pretty cheaply," said William E. Rhodes, chief investment strategist of Rhodes Analytics in Boston. This price drop, he added, means that "historically, for some tech stocks, valuations are not that high."
At the close, the Nasdaq was up 48.20 points, or 3.4 percent, to 1,467.55. That surpassed the high reached in the summer rally, which ended Aug. 22 with the Nasdaq at 1,422.95. The Nasdaq has not been this high since June 19. But while the Nasdaq is near a five-month high, it is only 44 points above the low it reached after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
Among the stocks pushing the Nasdaq higher were Intel, up 5.5 percent; Microsoft, up 2.2 percent; and Cisco Systems, up 6 percent. 
The Dow was up 222.14 points, or 2.6 percent, to close at 8,845.15. That is still 208 points below the high on Aug. 22 of 9,053.64. 
The S.& P. 500 index rose 19.61 points yesterday, or 2.2 percent, to 933.76, almost 29 points below the close on Aug. 22 of 962.70.
Because the Dow and S.& P., which have lower weightings of technology stocks, have yet to break above their Aug. 22 levels, announcing a new trend in the market is difficult. But there was an end-of-the-year market rebound last year, with the Nasdaq up 37 percent from its Sept. 21 low. The Dow rose 21.7 percent, and the S.& P. 500 rose 18.9 percent.
The current rally has lasted 31 trading days, already 9 more than the summer rally from July 24 through Aug. 22. The S.& P. index is up 20.2 percent, slightly behind the 20.7 percent rise in the summer. The Dow has beaten its summer performance with a 21.4 percent climb to date, compared with a 17.5 percent rise in July and August.
General Electric also helped push the market higher, despite the fact that the company lowered its profit forecast for this year and next. What appeared to be a positive was that G.E. said that it would have to set aside $1.4 billion in additional reserves against losses at its reinsurance unit, less than the $2 billion that many analysts had expected. G.E. also raised its quarterly dividend by a penny, to 19 cents a share.
Worries about losses at the reinsurance unit because of asbestos claims and those related to the terrorist attacks had been depressing G.E.'s stock.
After the announcement yesterday, shares of G.E. jumped $2.05, or 8.3 percent, to $26.85. It is still almost 22 percent below its Aug. 22 close of $32.70.
There was also some positive economic news yesterday, with the report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia that its regional manufacturing index rose to 6.1 in November from minus 13.1 in October. A reading over zero means that a majority of the manufacturing companies surveyed said business had improved.
In addition, initial claims for unemployment benefits dropped to 376,000 last week from 401,000 the week before, the lowest level in four months.
These scraps of brighter economic data, along with the surge in stocks, sent bond prices lower and yields, which move in the opposite direction, higher. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note jumped to 4.15 percent, from 4.06 percent Wednesday. The price fell 24/32 to 98 25/32 .
Shares of Morgan Stanley jumped $2.89, or 6.6 percent, to $46.40, after it was reported that the brokerage firm planned to cut about 2,000 more jobs, or about 4 percent of its work force, as business for underwriting stocks and trading equities slows.
Morgan Stanley's latest layoffs reflect an industrywide trend. Lehman Brothers laid off about 500 employees a week ago and two Dutch financial firms, ING and ABN Amro, both announced layoffs yesterday.
The other big player in the stock market rally since Oct. 9 has been financial stocks, including banks, insurance companies and brokerage firms. The S.& P. sector including these stocks was up 27 percent through yesterday.
The sector that has performed the poorest is consumer staples, which are often a refuge for investors when the economy is weak. This sector has slipped 0.4 percent.

HEADLINE: New York's Budget Needs More Cuts, Pataki Acknowledges 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki's budget director today asked state agencies to cut spending by 5 percent for the rest of this fiscal year, and said cuts next year would be deeper than expected.
 It was the administration's first admission that the state was in worse financial shape than it predicted earlier this year, something that officials in both houses of the Legislature have been saying since the summer. 
 As recently as last month, administration officials insisted that the current budget would take the state through the end of the fiscal year, March 31, without any significant changes.
Cuts in the next year's budget have long been expected, with the state facing a deficit that legislators have estimated at $5 billion to $10 billion. The governor's office has not put a figure on the shortfall. Mr. Pataki will propose a budget for that year in January.
"These are very difficult economic and fiscal times for the city, for our state government and for other state governments," Mr. Pataki said at an unrelated appearance here today, "and we do have to look at a number of different things as we go forward to deal with the decline in revenue."
In a letter to department chiefs, Carole E. Stone, the budget director, told them to report back no later than Nov. 29 with new budget-cutting plans.
"I am asking that you prepare to accelerate implementation of the proposals that are being developed for the 2003-4 executive budget to maximize savings in the current fiscal year, and that you develop more aggressive proposals for next year," she wrote.
For the current year, she wrote, state agencies should aim for "savings totaling a minimum of 5 percent," and those savings "should recur or grow in 2003-4."
Late last year, Mr. Pataki announced a hiring freeze, saying he intended to reduce the state's work force by 5,000 people, or about 2 percent, by early 2003, through attrition and early retirement incentives, as part of an effort to trim expenses by $3 billion. Though it appears that the state might meet the 5,000-job goal, the state has hired several times as many workers in the same period.
In her letter, Ms. Stone said agency heads should "place particular focus on reducing your agency work force." But state officials said it was fairly clear that relying on attrition and buyouts would not reach the target of cutting spending by 5 percent quickly enough.
Last month, as Mr. Pataki, a Republican, was running successfully for re-election, his Democratic opponent, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, released a report saying that six months into the fiscal year, general fund revenue was down 16 percent from the previous year, compared with the 5 percent predicted at the time the Legislature approved the budget. The governor's office disputed those figures but did not provide its own.
An updated report from Mr. McCall this week put the general fund decline at 8 percent.

HEADLINE: Transit Fare Increases Are Certain, M.T.A. Board Decides 

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has ruled out cutting service to maintain the current transit fare, guaranteeing that fares and tolls will rise next year to close a gap of almost $1.1 billion in the agency's budget, officials announced yesterday.
 The only questions now, they said, are whether the basic fare will rise to $1.75 or $2 and whether there will be service cuts or deeper discounts for MetroCard users. 
 Earlier this week, the authority held out the possibility that the fare could be maintained if deep service cuts were imposed. But Peter S. Kalikow, the authority chairman, said at a board meeting yesterday that officials had ruled out that plan because "in the end we would not be able to fulfill our mission and we would go back where we were" when the system suffered from severe neglect in the 1970's and 80's. 
As opponents of an increase stood outside on Madison Avenue with bullhorns chanting "Stop the fare hike! Open those books!" Mr. Kalikow insisted that the authority could find no other way to fix its badly broken budget. "We don't propose fare hikes or service cuts frivolously," he said.
Officials said the first option was raising the base fare to $1.75 and imposing significant cuts in service, such as a 10 percent drop in weekend subway and bus trips and cuts in cleaning.
Under this plan, there would also be a similar fare increase for the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Commuter Railroad but only a 25-cent rise in bridge and tunnel tolls. Those increases would come with similar service cuts, such as fewer trains, ticket-window closings and fewer cleaners. A $1 monthly fee for E-ZPass users on the highways would also be levied.
The second plan is to raise the subway and bus fare to $2 with commuter rail and toll increases, but to offer deeper discounts than are now available for MetroCard users and monthly pass users on the commuter rails.
For example, Mr. Kalikow said, a monthly unlimited-ride MetroCard might rise to $70 from $63, meaning that a fare increase would be felt much less by those who could afford to use the monthly or weekly cards.
Transit officials said this plan would increase fare revenues by $850 million over the next two years and, along with other savings, would close the budget gap as long as state and city aid remained level and the economy continued to improve.
They added a third plan, which would give the authority a larger cushion if the economy faltered or state and city subsidies declined, a real possibility as both Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki seek to repair their own debt-ridden budgets. Yesterday, in fact, Mr. Bloomberg repeated that he wanted to cut the city's contribution of more than $300 million to the authority. "We have to cut everything back," he said, "and while it is a state law as to how much we have to subsidize the M.T.A., we're cutting back other services. It's only appropriate that if you spread the pain evenly, there would be some cuts there, too."
The third option, transit officials said, would increase fares and tolls but offer the same level of discounts available now. The weekly unlimited MetroCard, for example, could rise to $23 and the monthly card to $84. This option, officials said, would balance the transit budget even if the authority lost $400 million in expected income over the next two years and had to spend more on security.
Transit officials sought to explain yesterday how it was that the authority had ended up in such financial straits after having a surplus of almost $200 million just four years ago.
Gary G. Caplan, the authority's budget director, said the problems have been caused by rising pension costs, dropping income from taxes dedicated to mass transit and rising service payments on the authority's debt, which has increased substantially over the past few years to pay for capital improvements. Officials also noted that the authority's labor contracts were being negotiated and that those costs would probably rise.
Mr. Caplan and others also said repeatedly that, with the MetroCard, the average fare has actually decreased since 1995, when it was raised to $1.50. The average fare is now $1.04 because people have taken advantage of card discounts.
Opponents of a fare increase, however, questioned whether the authority's finances were as bad as officials were saying. Even if they were, they asked, should riders be responsible for fixing them? In other cities, riders pay a much smaller part of transit systems' operations with fares, and the government -- to encourage use of mass transit -- provides greater subsidies. (In Boston, for example, fares pay 29 percent of transit operations. In New York, the current fare pays 58 percent of the cost, according to the Federal Transit Administration.)
"If there are fiscal problems," said Roger Toussaint, president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, "it is not the fault of passengers, who are riding and paying at near-record levels. It is not the fault of our members, whose productivity has soared, causing per-rider costs to drop. The long-term problem is Albany's neglect of adequate public funding for mass transit."
Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, also questioned why the basic bridge and tunnel tolls, which the plans would increase by either 25 cents or 50 cents, were not being increased as sharply as fares. Traditionally, tolls have risen along with fares, and the extra toll money has been used to help keep fares down as part of a longstanding public policy to encourage mass transit use.
"What I'm concerned about is whether a 35-year-old policy of using toll surpluses to keep fares affordable is ending," he said.
Mr. Kalikow said he discussed the fare-increase options with Governor Pataki, who controls the authority board and maintained during his recent re-election campaign that he opposed an increase.
"He heard what we said," Mr. Kalikow said of the governor. "I don't have a decision, but we'll discuss it."
Mr. Kalikow added that anyone else who wanted to offer suggestions could do so on the authority's Web site, www.mta.info.

HEADLINE: Throwaway Societies of Yesteryear; 
Past Decades Were the Golden Ages for Waste, Scientist Says

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The idea that America's output of garbage rises ever skyward -- more trash, year by passing year -- has become one of the great unchallenged assumptions about how the world works. The sun rises, the swallows return to Capistrano and our moldering mountain of refuse grows higher. The disposable society, like the tide, sweeps all before it.
 Daniel C. Walsh believed it, too, until he began poking through the musty records in the New York City Archives about 15 years ago. Dr. Walsh, an adjunct professor at the Earth Institute at Columbia University, stumbled on a long-unread paper trail that he said might be unique among big American cities: 100 years of painstakingly kept records about what New Yorkers threw away. 
 The millions of entries -- recording the weight of each cartload and truck, with periodic detailed examinations of what the carts contained -- began in the late 1800's. And when those entries are laid end to end in a timeline, as Dr. Walsh has done in a paper published last week in Environmental Science and Technology, they shatter a lot of myths. 
The much-lauded greatest generation of the 1920's and 1930's, for example, threw out far more garbage, Dr. Walsh found, than New Yorkers living today in the era of shrink wrap and single-serve. Pounds of trash per person peaked not in the prosperous 1990's, but in 1940.
Most people might expect that the trash of old was also more organic in content, with a higher proportion of materials derived from plants and animals -- a kind of dustbin extension of Grandma's kitchen, full of corncobs, peach pits, butcher paper and other compostable artifacts of a domestic age. 
Wrong again. Organic waste made up a higher proportion of New York City's garbage stream at the century's end, mainly from paper, than in any period before -- four times higher than it was in 1905, and almost twice as high as it was on the eve of World War II.
Even the history of recycling, the record showed, was not quite what it seemed. By many measures, Dr. Walsh found, the golden age of recycling in New York was not the save-the-earth 1970's, but the gilded-age 1890's, when mandatory curbside separation of trash was imposed. Recycling faded before World War I and did not return until the 1990's. 
Well, then how about product packaging? Surely it must be true that there's more of that now. Here Dr. Walsh, a geochemist by training who is also the chief of environmental monitoring in New York City for the State Department of Environmental Conservation, found that the conventional wisdom is only partly true, at best. The increase in packaging has been more than countered by the decrease in packaging weight. Trash per person in New York has barely budged in the last 20 years.
The great trend of the 20th century, Dr. Walsh concluded, has been toward less garbage -- or at least lighter garbage -- because the economics demanded it and technology made it possible. 
"There are very significant forces out there that are working to minimize the mass of the waste stream," he said. "The forces are strong and they're incredibly effective."
There are a few huge factors that explain -- or, some critics might say, skew -- Dr. Walsh's conclusions. A major element in explaining why the garbage today is lighter, and has a higher organic component, comes down to how New Yorkers heat their homes. The use of coal, which produces ash once tossed into landfills, began declining in the 1920's in favor of oil and later natural gas. By the early 1960's, when pounds of trash per person reached their lowest point in the century, that fuel transition had largely been completed. 
Dr. Walsh also conceded that lighter garbage did not necessarily mean fewer items. The city's records reflect weight per person, not volume. Still, the trend is clear that trash, over time, only gets lighter.
The average plastic gallon milk jug, for example, is a third lighter than it was in the 1970's. The oil crisis that struck in the middle of the decade pushed truckers and manufacturers to seek alternatives that were lighter and used less raw material. Remember how much an ordinary American beer bottle weighed during the administration of Gerald Ford? Go to a Chinese restaurant and order a Tsing Tao, brewed in China by bottlers who haven't faced the same pressures to lighten up. 
Garbage experts and historians of sanitation (a bigger club than you might think) say that Dr. Walsh has nailed a process that has largely been overlooked: that the market -- not politics or social policy -- mostly determines what happens inside the nation's garbage cans. But some also say that less waste per person and less waste as a society are not the same.
"I think there was not so much a reduction as a shifting of waste," said Mark A. Izeman, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York-based conservation group. The change in fuels toward oil and electricity, for example, might mean less garbage that New Yorkers put on the curb, he said, but more waste and pollution at the power plants where energy was produced. 
Lighter plastics have also meant greater reliance on chemically complex plastics that are harder to recycle. Technology, through the disposal of things like computers and batteries, Mr. Izeman said, has also made the waste stream far more toxic than it was in the past.
The heart of Dr. Walsh's research, however, is the century timeline -- a kind of ticker tape of trash that flickers by, marked by the rise and fall of trends and forces that would seem to have little to do with what people threw away. 
World War I and World War II loom as blips, when trash levels fell because of wartime scrap drives. Trash per person surged in the Roaring 20's and continued rising even during the Great Depression of the 1930's, partly perhaps because of construction debris from the huge public works projects undertaken in those years. Trash levels fell in the mid-1970's as the city's fortunes declined.
There are also images of a city long faded from view. 
Through the 1930's, for example, New Yorkers lived -- or at least ate -- in a greater rhythm with the seasons than they do today. Because refrigeration and transportation were still limited, fresh fruits and vegetables, reflected in the record as food waste, peaked with the harvest in late summer and early fall. Food waste reached its low point in January and February, when fresh produce was for most people not to be had.
But the most profound conclusion that emerged from the records, Dr. Walsh said, was not the historical nuggets, but the underlying engine that produced them. The big economic drivers of the 20th century -- improved transportation and refrigeration, the transformation of consumer convenience, the pressure on businesses to cut costs -- all moved in one direction: toward less waste, not more. He stressed that those findings were a result of independent research at Columbia, not his environmental work for the state.
"Everything relates to two principal factors -- one is reducing costs, making things lighter and easier to transport, and the other is making them more convenient to the consumer," Dr. Walsh said. "And that often means making them lighter, also. I see this pattern throughout the century."
Garbage economics does not always help, though. Sometimes it actually adds to the city's trash burden. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said this year, for example, that weak prices had made much of the city's recycling program untenable. The city suspended the recycling of glass and plastic in June, although Mr. Bloomberg said he hoped to restore the program in the next few years.
Sanitation experts say that Dr. Walsh's study proves Mr. Bloomberg right: markets do matter when it comes to trash. Another implication is that the market itself might bring recycling back into vogue.
"Recycling is going to become more cost effective relative to our other alternatives," said Benjamin Miller, a former City Sanitation Department official and author of "Fat of the Land: Garbage in New York, the Last Two Hundred Years" (Four Walls Eight Windows, 2000). Mr. Miller said he thought that rising costs of landfill disposal in places like Pennsylvania, where much of the city's trash now goes, would eventually tilt the balance back to the point where recycling is the less expensive choice.
Dr. Walsh said he had also become more optimistic that the trend toward reduction would continue.
"Sometimes these forces happen fast, like the replacement of metal and glass with plastic and aluminum; sometimes they're slow, like the replacement of coal, which took 50 years," he said.
Paper, currently the biggest item in the waste stream, will ultimately be replaced, too, in coming decades, Dr. Walsh said, by more economic digital technologies.
"There's no question that it will happen," he said, "because the forces are consistent through the century, and they will be consistent throughout the next."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Narrows Field Of Redevelopers for Arena 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Nov. 21 

 BODY:
New Jersey officials winnowed the field of potential redevelopers for the Continental Arena site in the Meadowlands from six to three today, eliminating proposals that centered on Nascar racing and extensive residential development.
 The proposals that cleared this first hurdle in a nearly three-month selection process by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority emphasize offices and shops built around different cores: a convention center combined with an indoor extreme-sports park, a family entertainment and sports complex that includes a minor-league baseball stadium, or an entertainment complex in an "urban village" setting. 
 All of the proposals for the 106-acre site seek to replace the arena, the current home of the New Jersey Nets and Devils, who are expected to move by 2005 to an arena proposed for downtown Newark.
The three finalists are consortiums with strong interests in the Meadowlands and the region, and extensive development experience in the state, but authority officials said that it was just a coincidence that they had all made it this far. 
Among them is the Westfield Group, which owns the nearby Garden State Plaza. Also chosen was a partnership of Forest City Ratner and Hartz Mountain Industries, the largest private landowner in the Meadowlands. The third finalist, the Mills Corporation, a mall builder with the development rights to a large, environmentally sensitive parcel near the Meadowlands, has indicated it would forgo developing that site if it is chosen as the Meadowlands redeveloper. The company is teamed with Mack-Cali Realty Corporation.
"These proposals contain the components and ideas that best suit the site," said George Zoffinger, the president and chief executive officer of the sports authority.
He and Carl Goldberg, the authority's commissioner and chairman of its redevelopment selection committee, said that one thing became clear in talks with advisory groups of merchants, elected officials and residents of the towns surrounding the Meadowlands: they did not want an automobile racing oval in their midst.
Most said they feared the noise from racing and the traffic that would be drawn to the 80,000- to 100,000-seat grandstands that had been proposed. "Politically it's a heavy lift," said one of the developers, referring to the two proposals that envisioned Nascar events.
David Talley, a spokesman for International Speedway Corporation, a company based in Daytona, Fla., that made one of the racing proposals, said the company would continue to try to introduce the sport to the region. The company has exclusive rights until next August to try to persuade the sports authority to allow it to redevelop the nearby Meadowlands Raceway, a horse racing track, for Nascar events.
Mr. Zoffinger said the three finalists must now provide more detailed information on the financing of their proposals, on their provisions for transportation and on the impact their plans would have on the environment. Those details are expected by Dec. 30, he said, and the authority is expected to announce its choice of developer early next year.
From the beginning, Mr. Goldberg and other officials involved in the selection process have said that they expected the successful bidder to contribute substantially to financing the construction and reconfiguration of roads around the site, and to creating the first-ever rail or light-rail connections to the Meadowlands site. 
The initial proposals were thin on such details, but Mr. Goldberg said the finalists are likely to flesh out "their willingness to invest private dollars" for a rail link and road work, which some have estimated could cost as much as $700 million.
The Westfield Corporation plan, with an estimated cost of nearly $1 billion, calls for converting the arena into an entertainment and theater complex with exhibition space set amid an "urban village" of low-rise shops and restaurants, and offices and hotels. A spokesman for the company said today that it was "pleased and delighted" to make the cut.
Emanuel Stern, president of Hartz Mountain Industries, said he, too, was enthusiastic about being a finalist. The $815 million "ExpoPark" proposal by Hartz and Forest City Ratner includes a medium-size convention center, an extreme-sports complex, four office buildings, hotels, shops and a multiscreen cinema.
A spokesman for the Mills Corporation and Mack-Cali group could not be reached. Their $1.2 billion "Meadowlands Xanadu" would include a hotel conference center and possibly a convention center, twice as much retail space as the other finalists, an extreme sports center, a Canyon Ranch spa and minor-league ballpark.
A group of Newark residents filed a lawsuit today in Essex County Superior Court that could affect the proposed arena for the Nets and Devils. The suit contends that city officials ignored public hearing requirements last month in agreeing to finance the arena with $165 million in windfall lease proceeds from a newly negotiated deal for the operation of Newark Liberty International Airport.

HEADLINE: Ordering Hunt for Bomb Plotters, Sharon Resists More Drastic Steps 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ordered Israeli forces today to return to Bethlehem to hunt down those responsible for a suicide bombing on a Jerusalem bus this morning that killed 11 people, including at least four children, and wounded dozens, Israeli officials said.
 For the moment Mr. Sharon resisted pressure from his political right for more drastic military action, although Israelis reeled from images of grieving parents and scattered school books, and a shredded teddy bear carried from the wreckage by an emergency worker. 
 The bombing and the Israeli and Palestinian responses to it provided a painful glimpse into the turmoil in the politics on both sides more than two years into the current conflict. 
In the foreground was the crippled bus, not far from the boundary with Bethlehem, the 23-year-old bomber's hometown; in the background were the sweeping ambitions of the Bush administration to reshape the Middle East with a possible war on Iraq. 
Israeli officials said Mr. Sharon, who met into the night with his security advisers, had been governed in his response by the American military intentions. "We are not going to allow any kind of escalation," said Raanan Gissin, Mr. Sharon's spokesman. He accused Palestinian terrorists of stepping up their own attacks in hopes of provoking such a response and opening a second front ahead of an Iraq war.
Through a spokesman, the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat condemned the bombing as terrorism. Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two militant Islamic groups, issued dueling claims of responsibility for the attack.
Mr. Sharon calculates that it is in Israel's interest to do what it can to avoid hindering the American effort to gain international support for a possible assault on Iraq. Israeli officials hope that an American victory will ultimately force Israel's adversaries in the region to sever links to terrorism and Palestinian militants.
Mr. Sharon also has more immediate concerns. In a week he faces a primary contest to retain the leadership of the Likud Party against Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Netanyahu, the former prime minister who recently became foreign minister, has shifted his emphasis from criticizing Mr. Sharon for failing to stop Israel's economic slide to criticizing him for failing to safeguard its security.
Recalling his own tenure as prime minister in the 1990's, Mr. Netanyahu has been declaring in advertisements: "Four suicide bombings in three years." In a deft twist of the knife, the advertisements are appearing on the sides of buses.
Dozens of suicide bombers have struck since Mr. Sharon was elected in February 2001 on a platform of peace and security.
But so far, Mr. Netanyahu's attacks from the right have not done much damage to Mr. Sharon within Likud. They appear to have placed him closer to the center of Israeli politics, the position that has helped sustain his popularity.
Mr. Sharon's response to today's bombing, if it remains restrained, may have the same effect, while also underscoring the cooperative relationship he has built with President Bush.
At the same time, the bombing could not have been more precisely timed or targeted to undermine Israel's left-of-center alternative to Mr. Sharon. Just two days ago, the Labor Party elected as its new leader Amram Mitzna, who will compete in general elections on Jan. 28 as Labor's candidate for prime minister against the winner of the Likud primary.
Mr. Mitzna is a former general who advocates immediate negotiations with the Palestinians, without conditions, and a unilateral Israeli withdrawal of soldiers and settlers from the Gaza Strip. Among other conditions before negotiations resume, Mr. Sharon insists that Mr. Arafat be replaced as Palestinian leader and that Palestinians halt all violence.
At issue is a fundamental difference of belief over the source of the conflict. Where Mr. Sharon sees a relentless, generations-old campaign of Arab terror to destroy the Jewish state, Mr. Mitzna sees some Israeli culpability, stemming from Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip after the Arab-Israeli war of 1967.
The wreckage of the No. 20 bus is a problem for the latter theory of the conflict and a possible blow to the idea that an Israeli withdrawal to pre-1967 borders might end the violence. The bombing took place on land that was Israel's before the 1967 war, and its victims included schoolchildren rather than only settlers and soldiers.
In fact, a debate is under way among Palestinians over whether it is legitimate to attack Israelis outside what is known in shorthand as '67 land.
Mr. Arafat today harshly criticized violence against Israeli civilians within the 1967 borders. 
"Resisting Israeli occupation and settlements doesn't mean targeting the lives of the Israeli civilians who have no relation at all with occupation and settlement activity," he said through his spokesman. "They are normal people who are living their daily lives, and targeting them is a condemned act ethically and politically."
The effect of such bombings, he said, is to make even "legitimate resistance" look like "blind terrorism."
But while Mr. Arafat has recognized Israel's right to exist, at least within its pre-1967 borders, Hamas and Islamic Jihad have not. In practice, these groups make no distinction among Israelis and have repeatedly shown a determination to kill them without regard to age, occupation or geography.
At the urging of the European Union and Egypt, Mr. Arafat's Fatah faction has been negotiating with Hamas to suspend suicide bombings in pre-1967 Israel, at least during the Israeli election campaign, when such attacks are likely to aid the right wing.
But in a commentary on a Hamas Web site today, Dr. Abdel Aziz Rantisi, a political leader of Hamas, rejected that distinction as well. "I'm shocked at what I hear people keep saying, that the Likud is violent and the Labor is peaceful," he wrote. They are both violent, he said.
In hopes of halting the violence on both sides, the so-called Quartet -- the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia -- is pressing the antagonists to adopt a "road map" toward peace and a Palestinian state in 2005.
Terje Roed-Larsen, the United Nations special envoy here, said Palestinians had diverse views about the violence. He argued that only the prospect of political progress could strengthen those in favor of peace, saying that so far "scores of cease-fire declarations" had yielded only more violence.
"Unless there is a political underpinning, they cannot take hold," he said, "and this is precisely what the work on the Quartet road map takes into account."
The road map is evolving. The Quartet recently added some requirements on both sides, including some that would be hard for Mr. Sharon: Israel would have to express a commitment to an "independent, viable, sovereign" Palestinian state and halt settlement expansion that would interfere with making Palestinian territory contiguous.
But that schedule means that if Mr. Sharon wins the Likud primary, he will be faced with the road map at least a month before elections. 
"Israel would not want to be put in a position where it would have to make specific decisions with regard to that before the situation with Iraq is cleared up," said Zalman Shoval, a Likud politician and Sharon adviser.
Depending on its final shape and timetable, the road map could force Mr. Sharon to make the decision he has so far evaded: choosing among his rightist political base, his averred willingness to make "painful concessions" for peace and his relationship with Mr. Bush.
It could also force Mr. Arafat to make an often-avoided choice between merely condemning killing like today's and trying to stop it. --------------------

Israeli Troops Move Into Bethlehem
JERUSALEM, Friday, Nov. 22 (AP) -- Israeli troops began retaliation early today, moving into Bethlehem and surrounding the Church of the Nativity, which marks the traditional birthplace of Jesus. An Israeli military spokesman, Doron Spielman, said the object was to prevent gunmen from seeking refuge in the church.
The army planned a "pinpoint operation," which would include entering Bethlehem, Mr. Gissin said.

HEADLINE: Approval of Park Drilling Angers Environmentalists 

BYLINE:  By BLAINE HARDEN 

DATELINE: PADRE ISLAND NATIONAL SEASHORE, Tex., Nov. 21 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has approved the drilling of two new natural gas wells in this national park, which lies along the nation's longest stretch of undeveloped beach.
 The approval, which has not yet been publicly announced and which follows a decision last spring to permit the drilling of an exploratory gas well in the park, ratchets up an environmental quarrel about the pace and wisdom of energy development on federal land. The Interior Department, which oversees the national parks, said the drilling would be done carefully to protect the park's 80-mile-long unspoiled beach and the 11 endangered species on the island. 
 The department points out that oil and gas exploration is not new on this barrier island. Sixty wells have been drilled here in the last 50 years, but the pace of drilling has fallen off sharply in the last two decades. 
"There is nothing new here," said Eric Ruff, a spokesman for Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, "and what is new is better." 
But national environmental groups, along with private organizations that monitor the federal parks, are outraged, pointing out that oil and gas exploration appeared to be phasing out in the park. The drilling has also upset experts on sea turtles who are working to protect the world's smallest and most endangered sea turtle, the Kemp's ridley. Padre Island is the principal American nesting ground for the turtles and the center of an intensive 20-year federal effort to save them from extinction.
"I am furious and dumbfounded that it would be necessary at this point to take such a chance with these turtles on Padre Island," said David W. Owens, director of the graduate program in marine biology at the College of Charleston in South Carolina and a member of the federally mandated international team charged with recovery of the turtle. 
To accommodate construction of the two new wells, the National Park Service will allow heavy trucks to drive about 20 times a day over turtle nesting grounds. Park service officials said here that they would prefer that drilling and truck traffic not occur in the spring and early summer, the turtles' nesting season, when they lay their eggs in holes they dig in the sand. That is also when most of the park's 800,000 annual human visitors come to the beach.
But the Nov. 8 decision by the park service allows trucks the right to roll at any time of the year, though at slow speeds and in escorted convoys.
"We now have an administration that thinks running a couple of hundred 18-wheelers over nesting grounds of endangered sea turtles inside a national park is not a significant environmental impact," said Robert Wiygul, a lawyer for the Sierra Club, which sued the Interior Department last spring in an effort to stop the exploratory well.
Mr. Wiygul said the pending suit would be amended to include the new drilling.
Another Sierra Club lawyer, Sanjay Narayan, said the government appeared to be opening the door to an extensive and long-term gas operation in the park.
There is enough gas -- 80 billion cubic feet -- underneath the island for 15 more wells, which might take up to 30 years to drill, according to an estimate by the United States Geological Survey.
Officials from the park service and from the company doing the drilling, BNP Petroleum of Corpus Christi, Tex., declined to predict how many or when more wells might be drilled here. A senior Interior Department official said future drilling depended on how much gas was produced by the new wells (two wells drilled in the 1990's were dry holes), as well as whether profits justified the cost. 
The decision to drill on Padre Island comes as the Bush administration, in order to reduce dependence on foreign oil, is encouraging drilling at more than 50 new sites on federal land in the lower 48 states, in addition to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
Critics of the president's energy policy describe the drilling here as a blatant example of what they say is a White House that is turning back decades of environmental progress in energy exploration in the West.
"This drilling is designed to enrich an oil company at the expense of the park, its visitors and its marine life,' said Randy Rasmussen, southwest regional director of the National Parks Conservation Association, which advocates park preservation.
Similar complaints echoed this week across much of the West -- and not just from environmentalists.
In northwest New Mexico, three large ranchers who lease federal land have restricted the access of gas operators who lease mineral rights on the same land. The ranchers accused the operators of sloppy, frenzied and dangerous practices that were killing cattle and fouling land. In response to the limited access, several oil companies sued the ranchers this week to regain what they say is their rightful access to the land. 
"It has gotten out of hand, especially in the past two years," said Chris Valesquez, who runs an 18,000-acre ranch. "I lost seven cattle this year, four run over by vehicles and three poisoned by chemicals around the gas wells."
Mr. Valesquez said the federal Bureau of Land Management was not enforcing its own regulations to limit the spill of toxic chemical around well sites.
In Denver this week, several ranchers joined about 60 leaders of environmental groups for what they described as a somber meeting about the speed with which the president was turning policy in Washington into action across the West.
"There is a stampede going on," said Dan Heilig, executive director of the Wyoming Outdoor Council, a conservation association. "We are seeing laws that require multiple use of the land being trumped by the national energy initiative."
Nowhere is the pace quicker than in Wyoming, where environmentalists expect that in January the Bureau of Land Management will approve its proposal for more than 51,000 new gas wells, the largest natural-gas project ever studied by the bureau.
Here on Padre Island, park service officials hand out highlighted copies of the 1962 law that created the national park. It guarantees that privately owned oil and gas deposits can be removed by methods that "are reasonably necessary."
Jock Whitworth, superintendent of Padre Island National Seashore, said that while the park could not stop gas drilling, it was controlling it with what he called the strictest drilling regulations anywhere in Texas. He said the park had received excellent cooperation from BNP Petroleum to use its trucks in a way to do the least harm to nesting turtles.
In another part of the national park system, Big Cypress National Preserve in Florida, where the law also allows oil and gas exploration, the Bush administration decided last January that drilling apparently would cause impairment, as a 1916 park service mandate says it should preserve scenery and wildlife "unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."
The administration promised to buy out mineral rights or swap mineral rights elsewhere for those in Big Cypress so there would be no more drilling in the preserve.
Here in South Texas this week, as word of the new gas drilling began to leak out, environmentalists complained bitterly about Florida.
"We would like to get the president to do for us what he did for his little brother," said Pat H. Suter, chairwoman of the local branch of the Sierra Club. "People don't go to the national parks to see heavy trucks."
It is unlikely, however, that local people will object much when the decision to allow more drilling is wider known. Oil and gas are the economic mainstays along the Gulf Coast of Texas. 
"This is an expected activity in this part of the world," said H. Scott Taylor, executive vice president for BNP Petroleum. "People around here understand the need for oil and gas operations."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Faith and Charity Help Family Weather Storm

BYLINE:  By ARTHUR BOVINO

 BODY:
When Mildred Jerez opened a religious artifacts store in Washington Heights in 1996, she was guided by two things: a strong faith and an equally strong desire to set aside tuition money and provide for her children's education.
 "I took the risk to make a brighter future for my children," Ms. Jerez said of her three sons, who sat on the couch across from her under a portrait of Jesus in her apartment during a recent interview. 
 After four years of operation and several setbacks, the store closed in 2000, and Ms. Jerez's faith was tested. Her family has been tested, too, but has not been shaken. She is still working hard to come through for her children. And they have come through for her. "The only reason I'm alive is because of them," she said. 
Ms. Jerez and her sons -- Alvin, Kenny and Adams -- live in a fourth-floor apartment in Washington Heights. She and her husband have been separated for four years.
In 2000, when Adams, now 13, was hospitalized with severe allergies, Ms. Jerez spent most of her time with him. Her business, the Botanica Jose Gregorio, suffered. After it closed, her debts were more than $120,000.
Ms. Jerez found part-time work cleaning rooms three days a week at the Marriott Courtyard Hotel near the World Trade Center. She also worked part time cleaning at a CVS. 
Then, after the attack on the trade center, she lost her job at the Marriott. A week later, CVS laid her off.
To lose one source of income was difficult. To lose three in quick succession was staggering. Besides her other debts, Ms. Jerez had used her sister's house in the Dominican Republic as collateral for the store. Each month, she has to send her sister $538 on that loan.
Depression overwhelmed Ms. Jerez. She started getting $143 a month in unemployment, but that ran out. Ms. Jerez had suicidal feelings and made three emergency room visits. That October, she was hospitalized and treated for depression.
After her release, the American Red Cross referred her to the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies and the Children's Aid Society, two of the seven local charities that participate in The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
In November 2001, the federation helped her with money from The New York Times 9/11 Neediest Fund. She was given $393 for eyeglasses, $834 for rent that month, $64.30 for a Con Edison bill, $80 to finish paying for her son's computer and $108.91 for a phone bill. 
Seeing his mother struggle, Alvin, now 22, wanted to do something. "I wrote her a letter telling her how much of an inspiration she is to me, how strong she is," Alvin said.
She still has the letter. It, more than anything else, gave her the strength to carry on, she says.
Alvin got financial aid to attend the Borough of Manhattan Community College and Kenny won a scholarship to Cardinal Hayes High School, a private school in the Bronx. Adams is in five advanced classes at Intermediate School 143.
"Little by little, I try to help on my end," said Alvin, who works 40 hours a week as a store manager. 
After working all day, Alvin attended night classes full time at Manhattan Community, where he got an associate's degree. He hopes to start at Baruch College in January, where he will pursue a bachelor's degree in business. 
His brothers work just as hard.
Kenny, 15, spent eight years in and out of the hospital with a kidney disorder. He had to learn how to walk all over again. Now, he pitches in with household chores. "He helps me sometimes," said Kenny, pointing to Adams, who hid his face in his hands.
The charities have been trying to help the family catch up. The Jerezes got $350 in emergency relief from the aid society. In March, it gave $600 toward winter clothing for the boys. In May, $302.72 in Neediest Cases money went toward overdue phone and electric bills. 
The aid agency used $1,500 in Neediest Cases money to pay two months of back rent. Ms. Jerez also qualified for Section 8 housing, which has reduced her rent to $278 a month. 
"It was a blessing just to find them," Ms. Jerez said of the agency. 
In May, the Marriott asked her to work two days a week. Last month, her hours were increased to 35 a week. She has chipped away at the debt from the store.
Despite adversity, faith and family remain strong. Kenny says he will open a day care center. Alvin wants to be a businessman. 
And he and his brothers have one other goal: providing for their mother. "She was both a father and a mother, she keeps us together," Alvin said. "I want to buy her a house away from all this."

HEADLINE: Democrats Ask Bush to Help Pass Benefits For the Jobless 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
Democratic leaders of Congress appealed today to President Bush to intervene in a standoff over extending unemployment benefits. House Republicans said they would not consider any proposal when the House met on Friday.
 In a letter, Tom Daschle, the top Senate Democrat, joined the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, in urging Mr. Bush to pressure House Republicans to accept a Senate plan to keep benefits from expiring on Dec. 28. 
 "If you simply indicated your determination to enact this modest extension of unemployment insurance before the House adjourns, House Republicans would certainly drop their opposition and pass this bill," they wrote to Mr. Bush, who is overseas.
The problem grows out of differing bills passed by the Senate and the House after Nov. 5. The House version would extend benefits to an estimated 800,000 people through January and tie the aid to proposed Medicare changes. The Senate, where there was opposition to the Medicare language, adopted a bill to cover two million people through March.
The House is scheduled to meet briefly on Friday to adopt technical changes to the bill to create the Homeland Security Department and then join the Senate in adjourning for the year. House Republican aides said that no action on unemployment was expected and that the Senate should have accepted the House plan.
Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said he planned to object to any attempt by the House to adjourn without addressing the benefits issue.
"I just find it beyond belief," Mr. Levin said, "when the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, passes a bill that will provide unemployment benefits that the House leadership wants to sit on its hands." 
In March, Congress passed a plan for an extra 13 weeks of benefits for people who exhausted their initial 26 weeks. Advocates of the extension say it would help the jobless and put money into the economy. 
House Republicans said their plan would have averted a gap in benefits.

HEADLINE: Fed Officials Say Policy Isn't Limited by Low Rates 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve may have lowered interest rates to the once unimaginable level of 1.25 percent, but senior officials insist they can still flood the country with money if they need to.
 "The U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press -- or, today, its electronic equivalent -- that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost," Ben S. Bernanke, one of the Federal Reserve's seven governors, said in a speech to economists here today. 
 In a detailed analysis that tracks fairly closely with more general comments last week by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, Mr. Bernanke described a the many ways the central bank could inject vast sums of money into the economy to combat deflation, even if interest rates were to drop to zero. 
"We can take comfort that the logic of the printing press example must assert itself, and sufficient injections of money will ultimately always reverse a deflation," he said.
Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Greenspan were both seeking to allay fears about what they still view as an extremely remote possibility: that the United States could drift into a period of deflation, or declining prices, in all sectors of the economy.
The issue is not entirely academic. Fed officials are keenly aware that Japan remains stuck with deflation and stagnation even though rates have been near zero since 1995.
American interest rates have been at 40-year lows for most of this year, but business spending and investment have still been stagnant and prices for manufactured products have been declining.
In an indicator of the anxiety, business groups are stepping up their calls for big new measures to stimulate the economy with more tax cuts. The Business Roundtable, an organization of chief executives from large corporations, called today for a $300 billion package of tax cuts to stimulate the economy.
Somewhat in contrast to the Bush administration, where top officials seem most interested in stimulating business spending, the Roundtable pleaded for tax cuts aimed entirely at the individual: a one-year cut in Social Security payroll taxes; accelerating last year's tax cuts; and eliminating the taxes on corporate dividends for individuals.
The Bush administration is considering a package of tax cuts. Although many officials are drawn to the idea of eliminating the so-called double taxation of dividends -- which are taxed as corporate profits and as income to shareholders -- several top advisers are skeptical about short-term stimulus measures and one-time tax breaks.
In an effort to bolster the economy, the Federal Reserve cut rates 11 times in 2001, bringing them to their lowest level in four decades, but many parts of the economy remain in the doldrums, prompting criticism from some that the Federal Reserve has little room left to prevent deflation.
Mr. Greenspan, in testimony to the Congressional joint economic committee last week, made a point of refuting that criticism. "Our conclusion is that we are not close to a deflationary cliff," Mr. Greenspan said. But if the Fed did reach the point where the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks dropped to zero, he said, the bank could still buy Treasuries with longer maturities and push down longer-term rates.
"There is virtually no meaningful limit to what we could inject into the system, were that necessary," Mr. Greenspan said.
Federal Reserve officials have looked closely and with concern at the plight of Japan, where the Bank of Japan has held its overnight rates near zero since 1995 and yet has been unable to stimulate demand or break free of deflation.
In September, the Bank of Japan went so far as to say it would start buying up portfolios of depressed stock held by the biggest and most troubled banks.
In June, the Fed published a working paper on whether Japan's problems raised questions about deflationary threats in the United States or the Fed's ability to respond, given that interest rates were already down to 1.75 percent at that time.
The paper concluded that Japan's problems were fundamentally different and that a crucial issue was the failure of Japanese leaders to recognize the deflationary threat or to take action before it got out of hand.
Mr. Bernanke, who found himself peppered by questions about Japan today, added that many of the problems were beyond the control of the Bank of Japan: the mountain of bad loans being carried by commercial banks; the large number of moribund companies being kept alive by banks; and political gridlock in pushing through economic reforms.
"It is not a technical problem," Mr. Bernanke said. "It is a political problem."

HEADLINE: A Beleaguered Hemisphere 

 BODY:
In a bitterly divided Venezuela, opposition leaders are threatening a general strike as part of their campaign to force President Hugo Chavez out of office. Next door in Colombia, fighting between leftist guerrillas and the army has intensified. Argentina recently defaulted on a World Bank loan, jeopardizing access to urgently needed financing to ameliorate widespread suffering. 
 Latin America, a global bright spot in the early 1990's when democratization and economic liberalization took hold with great promise, has fallen on hard times. Free-market economic prescriptions pushed by Washington have been discredited. Leftist and populist alternatives are gaining support, as evidenced by Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's election last month to the Brazilian presidency. 
 Memories of brutal military dictatorships may be too raw to imagine an epidemic of coups anytime soon, but authoritarian-minded governments may increasingly be tempted to capitalize on the widespread disenchantment to subvert the rule of law.
Despite pressing concerns elsewhere, the United States cannot remain indifferent to its hemisphere's woes. Brazil offers Washington a perfect opportunity to set a healthier tone in its dealings with Latin America, and it was encouraging to see Assistant Secretary of State Otto Reich in Brasilia yesterday pledging to back international financial assistance for Brazilian anti-poverty programs. President-elect da Silva may not share President Bush's economic philosophy, but he is a committed democrat and has made clear that his government will live up to its financial obligations. The two men will meet in Washington on Dec. 10, and Mr. Bush would be wise to forge a close working relationship with his Brazilian counterpart, thereby countering the impression that the United States celebrates Latin American democracy only when it is married to a narrow set of economic policies. 
Trade remains a source of friction. The administration, while standing up for its interests in opening South American markets, must be more understanding of legitimate Brazilian grievances concerning American protectionism when it comes to steel and agricultural products. Otherwise, American free-trade rhetoric will be seen as self-interested hypocrisy and the promise of a hemispheric free trade area will not be attained. 
Elsewhere, the administration must strongly champion the rule of law. This means taking Colombia's president, Alvaro Uribe, to task when his government goes too far in curbing civil liberties as it escalates its war against guerrillas financed by the drug trade. It also means insisting that Venezuela's opposition groups refrain from taking unlawful or violent paths in confronting President Chavez.

HEADLINE: 'Rebel Colonel,' Ecuador Favorite, Adopts Capitalist Look 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
Speeding to campaign events across this Andean capital, Lucio Gutierrez sounds every bit the button-down capitalist who by nearly every measure appears poised to win the presidency in an election this Sunday. 
 Forget that just three years ago he was a rebellious army colonel who led a revolt that toppled this country's president, drawing comparisons with another former coup plotter, Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez. Or that, like Mr. Chavez, he burst onto the political stage by railing against market reforms and the corruption of traditional parties. 
 Mr. Gutierrez, in an interview, was having none of it. He promised to create jobs with economic reforms and foreign investment, pay Ecuador's debt, negotiate a deal with the International Monetary Fund, and allow the American military to continue using its air base here. 
"I am a pragmatic individual, more than dogmatic," said Mr. Gutierrez, 45. "We have to break free from ideological limitations."
To critics, the shift in tone as the election draws closer is intended to soothe jittery foreign governments and investors. They say that if he wins this Sunday, as predicted by the polls, it would mean that voters in Ecuador -- like those in Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia and Peru -- had embraced a regionwide shift to the left, lured by the promises of a crowd-pleasing populist and dissatisfied by the failure of market reforms.
"Gutierrez is intelligent, and he says what people want to hear, but they don't know if he means it," said Ramiro Crespo, a financial analyst with Analytica investment house in Quito. "There is a doubt that he is a real convert." 
Seeking support from powerful indigenous groups and left-wing parties, Mr. Gutierrez has in the past said that Ecuador should reconsider paying its foreign debt and using the dollar, which replaced the sucre as the country's currency in 2000. 
The 22-page blueprint for his January 21 Patriotic Movement -- named for the date in 2000 when he led junior army officers in ousting President Jamil Mahuad -- calls for the rejection of "neoliberal globalization or any form of external intervention of international groups or foreign powers." 
Though any comparison to Mr. Chavez clearly makes Mr. Gutierrez and his aides uneasy, he has in the past praised the former Venezuelan paratrooper, once saying that he "has shown me the way."
Even now, critics like to point out, Mr. Gutierrez, who was briefly jailed after his coup, has some of the trappings of a strongman. He campaigns in a military-style safari suit that critics say is uncomfortably like the dress favored by Mr. Chavez. He is supported by parties like the Popular Democratic Movement, a Marxist group known for its extremism, and his campaign workers include several former military officers.
Alvaro Noboa, Mr. Gutierrez's adversary and a populist in his own right, has cast Mr. Gutierrez as a wild-eyed Communist in television advertisements. He says that Ecuador could become "another Venezuela," and he warns that his opponent "will become a dictator and give you bullets, bullets and bullets." 
But the message has apparently failed to strike a chord with Ecuadoreans tired of traditional parties and corruption -- Mr. Gutierrez's two biggest targets. The latest Cedatos-Gallup poll shows Mr. Gutierrez with 45 percent of the vote, to 30 percent for Mr. Noboa, a two-time presidential candidate whose banana farms have seen bitter strikes and the presence of child workers. Mr. Gutierrez argued that he had never changed his positions. Rather, he said, he has worked on being as encompassing as possible as he faces the clear possibility of leading this country of 12 million people.
"I am standing in the political center of my country because I want to unite all the Ecuadoreans," he said. "In Ecuador, the process will be done in unity and harmony, looking for consensus." 
After taking 20 percent of the vote in a first round of voting last month -- Mr. Gutierrez and Mr. Noboa took the most votes among a field of 11 candidates -- Mr. Gutierrez sought to calm investors and analysts who saw him as the second coming of Mr. Chavez. 
He promptly replaced his olive green uniform for a business suit and visited Miami, Washington and New York, meeting with I.M.F. officials, financial analysts and academics.
"I do not define myself ideologically, and I am not a populist, but rather popular," he said in a speech at the Harvard Club in New York.
Financial analysts say that the trip was a stroke of genius. The markets did not panic, as they did in Brazil when Luiz Inacio da Silva, a former leftist firebrand, soared in polls earlier this year before he won the presidency. 
Analysts cast the calm reaction, in part, to the fact that Ecuador already has a strong currency, the dollar. But also, political observers here see Mr. Gutierrez as much more moderate than the radical image presented by Mr. Noboa.
"I think Gutierrez is not a person of the left," said Simon Pachano, a Quito political scientist. Mr. Gutierrez is, instead, more of an alternative to the traditional, corrupt parties that have long hamstrung Ecuador, Mr. Pachano said. 
Nonetheless, Mr. Gutierrez, the son of a river boatman who is married and has two daughters, does raise questions about the feasibility of unhampered trade and other American-backed reforms here. . 
He says entering the Free Trade Area of the Americas -- the hemispherewide trade pact the Bush administration has been pushing -- would be "suicidal" in the short term because Ecuador could not readily compete with bigger neighbors. He also favors offering concessions to foreigners to operate state industries, like hydroelectric companies, rather than privatizing them.
Mr. Gutierrez asserts that his candidacy is the "hope of the poor, the marginalized, the excluded." Among those he has convinced is Juan Daquilma, 24, a student selling a Marxist paper at Mr. Gutierrez's final rally here on Wednesday. "He is our patriot, our rebel colonel," he said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE ALLIANCE; 
NATO LEADERS SAY IRAQ MUST DISARM

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
At a summit meeting scripted to embrace seven new members from the old Soviet bloc, the 19 leaders of the North Atlantic alliance united today behind President Bush and strongly condemned Iraq, saying it had failed to meet United Nations demands to surrender weapons of mass destruction.
 Yet Germany's continued opposition to taking part in any war with Iraq seemed all but certain to prevent the alliance from formally entering a campaign, though many of its members appeared willing to do so on an ad hoc basis. 
 Gathered in this graceful capital of Baroque and Gothic lines, the NATO leaders also agreed to an American proposal to establish a rapid reaction force over the next four years intended to move swiftly around the globe and keep NATO relevant in the fight against terrorism.
Late today, when Western leaders arrayed themselves around a huge circular table for their final session of the day, the Latvian president, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, thanked them for admitting a raft of militarily weak nations that crave the security and economic stability already being enjoyed in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. They joined the alliance in 1999. 
"Latvia lost its independence for a very long time," she said, "and knows the meaning of independence and the loss of it; knows the meaning of security, and the loss of it."
For Ms. Freiberga today was "a momentous moment writ large." As a child in 1944, she fled Soviet forces and her homeland by small boat. She grew up in refugee camps in Germany and French Morocco before settling in Canada, where she was a noted psychologist.
"Hope," she said, is what today's enlargement gives to the remaining small states in the Balkans and elsewhere that aspire to "the rock of political certainty" that membership conveys, along with encouragement for countries "trying to recover from a half century of totalitarian rule." 
But stirring rhetoric about expanding NATO to the borders of its cold war enemy did little to disguise the very real cracks in alliance unity on Iraq. Germany remains implacably opposed to taking part in a war, and the NATO leaders notably did not commit NATO forces to a military campaign against Iraq in the event Saddam Hussein does not comply with the United Nations' demands to disarm.
European diplomats and Bush administration officials did report a growing consensus that an ad hoc alliance comprising some NATO countries -- along with some Arab states -- would be willing to take part in an eventual military campaign against Iraq.
A senior administration official traveling with Mr. Bush said tonight that diplomatic contacts with dozens of nations that might be called upon to provide support or assistance in a military attack on Iraq were part of a strategy of prudent war planning to keep the pressure on Baghdad. It has until Dec. 8 to detail programs concerning weapons of mass destruction that senior Iraqi officials say they do not have.
Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush s national security adviser, said she remained "skeptical" that Mr. Hussein would comply. "We haven't seen anything yet which suggests that this is a leopard that is changing its spots," she said, adding a warning, "If Iraq tries to shift the burden of proof on to the inspectors, that would be a great mistake, because the burden of proof is on Saddam Hussein." 
The many political fissures within a slowly uniting Europe were evident in a new diplomatic divide today when the seven nations that were formally invited into NATO joined with three aspiring NATO countries in issuing their own muscular declaration on Iraq.
As a bloc of NATO newcomers, the East European and Baltic states that lived under Soviet rule have exuded a more militant and openly pro-American spirit. Mr. Bush has taken to citing this new spirit on NATO's eastern flank to exhort NATO's older members to action.
"The Baltic countries know what it means to live under fear and the lack of freedom and to have these countries be allied to the United States and other nations is important to our soul," Mr. Bush said in an interview with Lithuanian television today.
The newly accepted member states are Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia, which have a combined population of 46 million. Their membership in the alliance will be complete in 2004. Albania, Croatia and Macedonia joined them in the Iraq statement. 
They said in their communique that if Iraq failed to comply with the recent United Nations Security Council resolution on Iraq, "we are prepared to contribute to an international coalition to enforce its provisions and the disarmament of Iraq."
But the German-American rift was the deeper and preoccupying concern of this meeting, and not just because the German position on Iraq virtually ensures that the NATO alliance as an institution will sit out any Iraq campaign as it sat out the American-led attack on Qaeda and Taliban forces in Afghanistan. Germany is the powerful center of NATO on the Continent, and its pacifist stirrings could undermine alliance cohesion and America's push for a more aggressive, even pre-emptive, NATO posture against new terrorist threats.
President Bush and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder shook hands and exchanged pleasantries at a banquet Wednesday evening, but the chill between Berlin and Washington was still evident when Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer emerged from the summit meeting hall today to tell reporters that despite the strong NATO stand, "We are against military action," adding: "We don't support military action. We want the possibility not to become the reality."
Still, Germany supported today's NATO statement on Iraq, and one senior American official pronounced himself "gratified" that it had done so "without dragging its claws or being pushed."
A German official said Mr. Schroder would not apologize for taking a position that had broad political support at home.
"America has always said that they want self-confident leaders in Germany and now they have them," said the official, Karsten D. Voigt, coordinator for German-American affairs in the Foreign Ministry. For Mr. Schroder, he added, it was a matter of "self-esteem" to await the right moment for reconciliation.
Late today, during a photo session, Mr. Bush and Mr. Schroder again shook hands and exchanged a few words, and some Germans saw a signal that a thaw might have begun. 
France today, too, differed openly with the United States even as it endorsed unrelenting pressure on Iraq. French diplomats issued their own version of the NATO declaration, in French, with a critical change on what might touch off a war.
"It is true that both texts are operative," said a chagrined American official, because in NATO, English and French are the official languages.
France asserted that Iraq faced "serious consequences if it continues" violating its obligations, while the English-language version drafted by the American delegation said Iraq would face serious consequences "as a result of its continued violations of its obligations."
The French interpretation was a pointed signal that President Jacques Chirac's government still is seeking to remove any "automatic" catalyst for war. France favors giving Iraq a clear and final opportunity to bring itself into compliance.
"There is no alternative for Iraq to full and entire cooperation with the United Nations," Mr. Chirac told Western leaders, according to his spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna. "Iraq must understand that it must seize the chance that is offered, and understand that this is the last chance," he reportedly added. 
Madeleine K. Albright, secretary of state during the Clinton administration, was one of many dignitaries who traveled here to celebrate the first NATO summit meeting to be held in a former Warsaw Pact capital. Ms. Albright was born in Czechoslovakia and speaks Czech.
She admitted to a grudging admiration for what she termed Mr. Bush's transformation since his speech to the United Nations on Sept. 12. "I think it is the right direction," she said. "We have been seeing a different George Bush after the U.N. speech and I sense that he has gotten some reality check that has taught him that even if you want to go it alone, you can't." 
Mr. Bush said today that he looked forward to flying from this summit meeting to Russia, where he will meet President Vladimir V. Putin in the old northern capital of St. Petersburg. Diplomats described his visit as a necessary gesture to Mr. Putin for his forbearance in the face of NATO expansion and for his strategic alignment with Washington since the Sept. 11 attacks, but also in recognition of the influence Russia wields when allied with France and China, as it was during the United Nations debate on Iraq.
"I'm going to say to the Russian people, you shouldn't fear expansion of NATO to your border because these are peace-loving people and you ought to welcome them," Mr. Bush said. 
He also reassured Moscow that its economic interests in Iraq would be honored if the United States led an invasion force against Mr. Hussein. "We have no desire to run the show, to run the country," Mr. Bush said of Iraq in remarks to Russia's NTV network. "We will work to encourage the development of new leadership and protect the country s territorial integrity. 
"And we understand Russia has got interests there, as do other countries, and of course, those interests will be honored."

HEADLINE: G.E. Trims 2003 Profit Forecast, but Shares Climb 8.2% 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
General Electric cut its profit estimate for 2003 yesterday and said it would take a $2.1 billion pretax charge this quarter to increase reserves at its insurance division.
 But the company's stock rose 8.2 percent, as investors discounted the charge, which had been expected, and focused on General Electric's plans to raise its dividend and its optimistic projections for several divisions. 
 Jeffrey R. Immelt, General Electric's chairman and chief executive, offered the estimates at a conference for analysts in New York. In a sign of General Electric's importance to the market, more than 2,500 people listened to a simultaneous Webcast of the conference, the company said afterward. 
Over all, General Electric said it expected profit growth of 3 to 13 percent next year, with earnings in a range of $1.55 to $1.70 a share in 2003. Previously, the company had said it expected to earn $1.70 a share.
This year, the company expects to earn $1.51 a share after the insurance-related charge. The charge will be $1.4 billion, or 14 cents a share, after taxes. Eleven of the company's 13 business units will grow more than 10 percent next year, General Electric said.
Some skeptical money managers, though, said General Electric had used misleading math to arrive at its profit growth estimate. David C. Frail, a General Electric spokesman, disputed that analysis and said the company considered its estimate accurate.
At the conference, the company said it expected profits in units that are especially sensitive to the economy, including the NBC television network and its plastics division, to rise by more than 20 percent in 2003, to at least $3.1 billion. Still, General Electric expects only a sluggish economic recovery next year, Mr. Immelt said.
Profits at GE Capital, the company's huge financial unit, which includes insurance and an equipment-leasing business, will rise to at least $7.3 billion next year. That figure is 10 percent higher than GE Capital's 2002 profits, which will be $6.6 billion before the insurance-related charge.
Those gains will be offset in part by falling profits at the power systems unit, which makes natural gas turbines that produce electricity and has lost many orders as independent power producers like Calpine scale back on their expansion plans. Profits at power systems will fall about $1.5 billion, as the division's sales fall to $20 billion from $23 billion.
Executives said the company remained disappointed in the lagging performance of the reinsurance unit, which provides protection for other insurance companies against catastrophic losses like weather disasters or large jury verdicts. The charge will lower General Electric's earnings by 14 cents after a $500 million tax benefit, the company said.
"This is not the type of reliable performance we expect at G.E.," Mr. Immelt said. "It's not the status quo."
Nevertheless, the company said that it would raise its annual dividend to 76 cents a share from 72 cents. G.E. will pay out almost $8 billion a year in dividends in 2003, it said.
The company's profit forecasts were not particularly impressive, said Michael Holton, an analyst for T. Rowe Price who attended the meeting. But G.E.'s stock has fallen almost 60 percent from its peak in 2000, so even a mediocre forecast was enough to help its shares, Mr. Holton said.
"There was heavy skepticism coming into the meeting," Mr. Holton said. When the company did not announce a bigger-than-expected loss for its reinsurance unit, hedge funds that had shorted its shares, betting they would fall, moved quickly to cover and G.E.'s stock rose, he said. "No bad news is good news for a beaten-down stock."
Analysts and fund managers including Thomas K. Brown and Robert Olstein have said in the past that General Electric used legal but misleading practices to make its growth appear stronger. Some money managers echoed those complaints yesterday, arguing that the company was deliberately playing up the impact of the insurance charge this year so that its results next year would look stronger in comparison. General Electric is encouraging investors to think of its baseline earnings this year as $1.51 a share, after the 14-cent insurance charge, but the company does not expect to take a similar charge in 2003.
So to compare the company's results more accurately, investors should consider G.E.'s earnings this year to be $1.65 a share, not $1.51, the managers said. By that standard, the $1.55 to $1.70 a share that General Electric expects to earn in 2003 would not be an improvement from this year's results.
"We don't believe that the business segments are going to do as well as they say they're going to do," said Fred Sears, a fund manager for Investors Capital who oversees the allocation of $140 million.
Mr. Frail of General Electric said that analysis was wrong. The 14-cent charge is a normal part of doing business and should not be considered a one-time item, Mr. Frail said. In addition, the company has had about $900 million in one-time gains and tax refunds this year, adding 9 cents a share to its earnings. G.E. does not expect any similar gains next year, he said.

HEADLINE: Regulators Say Morgan Stanley Did Not Keep E-Mail Records 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Securities regulators who are investigating the practices of Wall Street analysts said that Morgan Stanley, the nation's second-largest brokerage firm, failed to maintain internal e-mail records as required by securities laws. As a result, several investigators said, there are fewer Morgan Stanley documents to analyze than have been produced by some other firms. 
 The release of brokerage firm e-mail messages by various regulators examining Wall Street research has embarrassed Merrill Lynch, Salomon Smith Barney and Credit Suisse First Boston in recent months. Messages written by Henry Blodget, the former Merrill Lynch Internet stock analyst, were central to the case brought against that firm by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, last April. Those e-mail messages, as well as others written by colleagues at the firm, seemed to show that the firm's analysts were deriding stocks in private that they were recommending to the public. Merrill paid $100 million to settle the case. 
 Morgan Stanley's e-mail messages are of interest not only to regulators examining conflicts of interest among Wall Street firms' research departments and their investment banking units, but also to investors who lost money after following the advice of the firm's analysts.
During the stock market mania, perhaps the most famous of the firm's analysts was Mary Meeker, who followed Internet stocks. Like other powerful analysts at major firms, Ms. Meeker helped attract securities deals for Morgan Stanley. But most of the stocks she recommended to investors plummeted when the Internet bubble burst in 2000. 
"We believe we have fully satisfied the regulators, and ours has been a good-faith effort to cooperate with every aspect of this investigation," said Diana Quintero, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman. "We have produced close to 400,000 pages of documents of which more than 200,000 are e-mails and e-mail attachments. There are no outstanding requests for e-mails." 
Federal securities laws require brokerage firms to retain e-mail relating to the brokerage firm's overall business for three years. The records must be preserved "in an accessible place" for two years after they are written. Prosecutors say that under New York state law, a firm that deleted e-mail messages that it was required to maintain could be found guilty of falsifying business records. If the destruction of the e-mail messages was found to be intentional, the firm could face a felony charge. Wall Street firms have complained for years about the law requiring e-mail message retention, arguing that such messages should not be considered the type of communication that must be preserved. The firms have also said that complying with the law is impractical and an onerous financial burden.
Regulators said they became aware that brokerage firm compliance with document retention rules was spotty when they started investigating analyst activities about one and a half years ago. Last November, the S.E.C. reiterated its view that e-mail messages are covered by the law and must be preserved. 
Last May, regulators at NASD advised several Wall Street firms that their compliance with the rule on e-mail message retention was unsatisfactory and began investigating those policies. If the firms are found by regulators to have mistakenly deleted messages that they were supposed to keep, they could face fines extending into the high six figures. If the firms destroyed the messages purposefully, penalties are more significant, including suspension or expulsion from the securities industry. 
Several securities regulators involved in the investigation said that bringing a case against a firm that did not retain all its e-mail messages would require a significant effort.
It is unclear why Morgan Stanley's production of e-mail messages is viewed as unsatisfactory by regulators. But some regulators have expressed a desire to make evidence public so that disgruntled investors could use it for their own suits. Clients of Merrill Lynch and Salomon who lost money may have an easier time mounting civil cases to recover money because so many damaging e-mail messages from those firms have been made public by investigators. 
Regulators are also concerned that the firms that adhered to the law will wind up being punished far more than firms that did not comply. One regulator, who declined to be identified, said, "There is some perversity in the fact that the firms that are getting hit pretty hard in the press and in terms of the sanctions are firms that had reasonably good record retention policies."

Fed Officials Say Policy Is Not Limited by Low Rates
The Federal Reserve may have lowered interest rates to the once unimaginable level of 1.25 percent, but officials insist they can still flood the country with money if they need to. "The U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press -- or, today, its electronic equivalent -- that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost," Ben S. Bernanke, a Fed governor, said.
 In an analysis that tracks fairly closely with comments by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke described several ways the central bank could inject money into the economy to combat deflation, even if interest rates were to drop to zero. Page C6.

Ad Firms Play a Role in Drug Trials
Madison Avenue -- whose ads have helped turn drugs like Viagra and Allegra into billion-dollar products -- is expanding its role in the drug business, wading into the science of drug development. The three advertising giants -- Omnicom, Interpublic and WPP -- have spent tens of millions of dollars to buy or invest in companies that perform clinical trials. A1.

Corporate Assets Moving Offshore
American companies have been shifting some of their most valuable assets, like drug patents, to tax havens, government data show. The companies then charge their subsidiaries in higher-tax locales for the use of the assets, which allows them to take profits in the havens and pay far less in taxes. C3.

Vivendi Spurns Offer for Entertainment Units; Stock Rises

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
Vivendi Universal has shrugged off an overture for its American entertainment businesses from Marvin Davis, the investor and oilman.
 Vivendi executives in Paris are increasingly inclined to hold onto the entertainment assets, including the Universal studios, music and theme parks, a games division and the USA Networks and Sci-Fi cable channels. 
 Vivendi confirmed in a statement today that a representative of Mr. Davis met with executives early this month and that the board was told of his interest. The statement also said Mr. Davis's representatives were told that "an entertainment asset sale was not on the agenda." 
Mr. Davis, 77, also sent a letter to Vivendi executives in Paris about a month ago outlining an offer of $15 billion plus the assumption of $5 billion in debt, a person close to Vivendi said. "For us, it was a nonevent because we do not want to sell these businesses," this person said. "We simply filed the letter away."
Vivendi stock surged today after The Wall Street Journal reported Mr. Davis's interest. In Paris, the shares rose 21 percent, to 13.80 euros. In New York, the American depository receipts closed up 19 percent, at $14. 
Still, Hollywood executives largely dismissed the notion that Mr. Davis could ever acquire the Vivendi Universal assets. "Marvin is just kicking the tires," said a person who had talked with Barry Diller, who has assumed an expanded role as interim co-chairman and chief executive of a new holding company that encompasses all the entertainment divisions.
Others questioned whether Mr. Davis could raise enough cash under current economic conditions.
One executive close to Vivendi put the chances of a deal at "somewhere south of never."
Despite Vivendi's rebuff and the skepticism over his offer, Mr. Davis said in a statement today that he and a group of partners "are in talks with Vivendi Universal."
"We believe our proposal provides full and fair value for the assets, and VU's response has been positive," he said.
Mr. Davis, who made much of his money in oil and real estate, was once a very visible deal maker, but has been largely on the sidelines since the late 1980's, when he made runs at United Airlines and Northwest Airlines.
With a partner, Marc Rich, Mr. Davis bought a controlling interest in 20th Century Fox in 1981 for $722 million. (Mr. Rich, the fugitive financier who was pardoned by President Bill Clinton, was bought out in 1984.) Mr. Davis had some initial success with Fox, but after two years of losses sold the studio to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in 1985. 
Any decision to sell Vivendi's businesses is likely to require the approval of Mr. Diller, with whom Mr. Davis clashed while at Fox. Mr. Diller could force Vivendi to pay up to $2 billion to cover tax liabilities that would come due if the USA Networks and Sci-Fi Channels changed hands, part of the original agreement Mr. Diller negotiated when he sold these businesses to Vivendi last year.
In his statement, Mr. Davis said that Brian C. Mulligan, a former co-chairman of Universal Pictures and chief financial officer of Seagram, would play a role in the management of the businesses if he were to be successful.
But few people see any reason Vivendi would want to sell its entertainment businesses at a time when values for such assets are low. 
In recent weeks, Jean-Rene Fourtou, Vivendi's chief executive, has won breathing room from creditors by agreeing to sell $5 billion worth of assets, including the publishing division and parts of the Canal Plus pay television network. Vivendi recently completed the sale of a bond that will be convertible into Vivendi shares, raising an additional one billion euros.
And Vivendi is poised to announce an agreement to sell 20 percent of its 40 percent stake in Vivendi Environnement, the water and waste management company that was part of the original business, before Jean-Marie Messier, the former chief executive, transformed it into a media conglomerate. The board of Vivendi Environnement met today to vote on the plan to sell the shares to a group of utilities and French banks including Electricite de France, Societe Generale and BNP Paribas, a person who has been briefed on the details said. An announcement could come as soon as Friday.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: KABUL; 
In Post-Taliban Poverty, At Least There Is Hope

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
A year after the Taliban departed in tatters, the extraordinary has become the ordinary here and citizens generally revel in what is for many the distant but distinct opportunity to lead normal lives.
 A family of returning refugees lives in the house where a group of suspected Al Qaeda members kept a list of flight schools in the United States. Teenagers play pickup basketball in the park where Kabul residents mutilated the bodies of pro-Taliban militants. The cellphone has replaced the turban as the city's leading power symbol. An estimated 2,000 mostly Western aid workers have replaced the hundreds of Pakistani and Arab militants who lived here. 
 Where Taliban thugs once searched tirelessly for violators of the regime's draconian moral code, the police in Kabul now spend their days fighting a new evil: snarled traffic. 
Kabul may be dirty, chaotic and overcrowded, but it brims with newly hatched freedoms and expectations.
"I don't remember a better day than the one when the Taliban left," said Abdul Wakil, the 35-year-old owner of a fabric store on the main road leading into the city. Mr. Wakil, who was applauding last November when victorious forces and friends of the Northern Alliance streamed into Kabul, is still in good cheer, praising the country's new government and the international aid effort here. 
Indeed, an estimated three million children, many of them girls, are enrolled in schools for the first time, according to the United Nations. More than eight million children have been vaccinated against disease. And in Kabul, where B-52's once circled the skies in search of targets, commercial jets now thunder overhead. The world pays attention to the city's travails, instead of ignoring them.
Yet, not all Afghans are as enthusiastic as Mr. Wakil, and not all the changes have been for the best. Whether a sign of unaccustomed prosperity or a new sort of desperation, Kabul is palpably, undeniably bursting with people. As many as half of the estimated 1.5 million refugees who flooded back to Afghanistan this year appear to have ended up here, doubling the city's population.
The city's overburdened power grid continues to fail for hours at a stretch. Children caked in dust play on back streets still made of dirt. Sewage continues to flow into ditches in poor neighborhoods, leaving them to stink all day, every day of human waste. 
"The streets are very full," said Shah Muhammad Rais, a 57-year-old bookseller in Kabul who has watched regimes ascend and crumble in Kabul for nearly 30 years. "But Afghanistan is broke."
Just behind Mr. Wakil's store lies a maze of crude, one-story houses that once made up a working-class neighborhood but have now become hot properties. Rents have surged to up to $100 a month from about $20 a month.
While the Taliban may have warped religious practice here, the arrival of the West has warped the economy, according to critics. There is rising frustration that the foreign aid trickling into the country is not improving the lives of average Afghans. Indeed, with food prices soaring at about the same rate as rents, it may be making things worse for most of them.
A growing number of Afghans lay much of the blame to a multitude of United Nations and diplomatic compounds, brimming with computers, telephones and sport utility vehicles, that appear as islands of exorbitant -- and inflationary -- spending in a sea of poverty.
One of the bitterest complaints from officials in the new Afghan government is that most of the $1 billion in aid sent here has been funneled through the United Nations and nongovernmental organizations. The officials say that has marginalized Afghan government officials, who have a hard time competing for talented workers and curbing the growing corruption. 
In Wazir Akbar Khan, the city's wealthiest neighborhood, aid workers and journalists pay up to $10,000 a month to rent a house. Pork, a meat banned under Islam, can be purchased at expensive new restaurants that cater to foreigners. Alcohol smuggled into the city helps fuel Western-style parties. 
Foreigners are not the only ones profiting here. The money they spend renovating offices, buying supplies and hiring local staff trickles down. Over the last year, hundreds of new jobs have been created by the United Nations, aid groups and journalists. Afghans who manage to snag such positions -- typically earning up to five times more than the $200 a month paid to cabinet ministers -- often drive new cars, wear jeans and leather jackets and drink, gamble and smoke hashish at parties. 
But for all the money being pumped in, there is surprisingly little activity, Afghans said. "On radio and television they are saying all of the world is helping us," said Ahmed Ali, an apple seller who lived through the Taliban years. "But they are not helping me."
There are suspicions that the members of the new elite are busy helping themselves, with little regard to the country's needs. The misgivings extend to government officials, who many suspect are not getting by solely on their salaries. Among the critics is Tariq Khan, an 18-year-old engineering student and one of hundreds of university students who participated in recent violent protests over dormitory living conditions. "In the time of the Taliban we had electricity," Mr. Khan said. "But in this government they fill their pockets."
Some of the strongest suspicions center on the powerful Ministry of Defense, which is still dominated by ethnic Tajiks from the Panjshir Valley, who led the victorious soldiers into the city a year ago.
The doubts reflect lingering divisions in the city. Many of the people who cheered the arriving soldiers were ethnic Tajiks, the group that formed the backbone of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. Thousands of Pashtuns, the group that made up the core of the Taliban, hid in their houses in fear of revenge attacks. But Kabul, to Afghans' credit, did not burn. Tajiks did not line up Pashtuns and shoot them, as was the practice in many past transfers of power.
In Kabul today, there is talk of ethnic harmony. Tajiks, Pashtuns and members of other ethnic groups all praised Mr. Karzai, who is Pashtun, for creating peace and security. Afghans exhausted by 23 years of war, say that their loyalties will go to whoever can create stability and prosperity.
Qand Agha, a 35-year-old returning refugee from Pakistan who lives with his wife and five young children in a tent across the street from a row of palatial houses rented by foreigners, summed up the dilemma for Afghans today: "I am very happy that there is peace," he said. "But what I want to have is a piece of bread for my children."

HEADLINE: THE SATURDAY PROFILE; 
Shouting the Pain From Japan's Germ Attacks

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: YIWU, China 

 BODY:
LIFE'S longest journeys can begin with a sudden epiphany, and for Wang Xuan that discovery came on a bright August morning seven years ago, as she lounged on a tatami mat in her home in Himeji, Japan.
 Browsing The Japan Times, she saw a brief item about elderly Chinese peasants planning to sue Japan for using bubonic plague as a weapon during World War II. The story mentioned that they lived in a rural village called Yiwu on China's east coast. Yiwu happened to be Ms. Wang's ancestral home, a place she had left behind years before for the promise of a new life in Japan. 
 "History fell into place when I saw that article," Ms. Wang said. "I knew why I had really come to Japan, and what I had to do as a Chinese."
What she vowed to do was to shake Japan, China and the United States out of the great Pacific amnesia about biological warfare. Ms. Wang assembled 180 Chinese victims and sued Japan, charging that its forces had spread bubonic plague and other diseases in China during World War II. The group claimed that 300,000 people were killed by germ warfare, though there are no official tallies. 
After five years in court, the plaintiffs scored a partial victory in late August when Judge Kohi Iwata of Tokyo District Court ruled that Japan's infamous Unit 731 "used bacteriological weapons under the order of the imperial Japanese Army's headquarters." The judge rejected compensation, however, saying the plaintiffs had no right to demand money from Japan under international law. That has forced Ms. Wang and her group to embark on a costly appeal against steep odds.
The Japanese government still denies that its army ever used biological agents. China, suspicious of most social movements, has prevented plaintiffs from organizing formally or accepting donations. The United States, wary of alienating its staunchest ally in the region, remains more focused on the potential threat of biological weapons today than on the destruction they wrought 60 years ago.
Even her plaintiffs' group, mostly elderly peasants in eastern and central China, threatens to collapse as its members despair of ever seeing justice in their lifetimes. 
"We are fighting Japan, China and the United States all at once," Ms. Wang said while riding through rural China to rally plaintiffs. "We need endless amounts of time to do this, and time is running out."
YET her cause, painful as it is, has already repaired the jagged ends of her fractured life. Ms. Wang was born in 1952 and grew up in relative comfort. Her father served as a judge on Shanghai's criminal court. He initially embraced China's new Communist leaders, but family members were persecuted as "rightists" in the late 1950's. During the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960's, Ms. Wang was "sent down," in the terminology of the day: she was ordered to leave the city and work as a peasant.
She spent her college-age years plucking rice stalks in a tiny village called Chongshan, just outside Yiwu, where she lived with members of her father's ancestral family. As a city girl working the rice paddies, Ms. Wang said, "I nearly broke my back." But it crushed her spirit even more. Her education was on hold, and her family and friends seemed hopelessly distant. "There was not a single book in the whole village," Ms. Wang recalled.
Yet she developed deep local ties. Those came from hearing peasant tales of grisly atrocities committed by "Japanese devils" during the war. An uncle she never knew, Wang Haibao, was one young victim of what the peasants then called rat disease. She learned later that it was the plague, which first infected rats, then people.
She also developed a nagging sense of social justice. As hard as her life had become, she said, she realized that she was infinitely better off than the peasants around her. Her brief internment was their daily drudgery.
"These were my relatives," Ms. Wang said. "They shared my name. But they had no rights. For the simple reason of being born in the city, I had a totally different life."
After Mao's death in 1976, Ms. Wang dreamed of moving far away. The United States was her choice. But she was married by then, to a volleyball star. It was he who got the coveted visa -- but to Japan. Ms. Wang, though wary at first, accepted Japan. She became fluent in the language, looking to prosper in what was then the center of the Asian economic miracle. 
But she soon found it oppressive. Japanese women stared at her if she did not wear stockings. The man who gave her driver's test tried luring her to a hotel. She discovered that European instructors at the language school where she taught were paid more. She asked for a raise, but her boss answered, "You are already too expensive for a Chinese."
THEN, in 1995, she stumbled on the article in The Japan Times. It seemed to confirm what she felt instinctively: Japan had changed only superficially since the war. It was a humble country on the surface, but still treated Chinese people as inferiors. 
"If Japanese society had been more accepting and open to Chinese women, I might never have gotten involved," she said. "But this place that had been devoid of meaning for me suddenly made sense."
Ms. Wang still lives in Tokyo. But she divides her time between courtrooms there and dusty highways in China, raising money, doing research and recruiting witnesses. 
She is again the city girl in the country. She wears black leather and silk blouses on trips. It is as if she is reminding herself, and perhaps others, that she belongs elsewhere.
Yet she knows Yiwu well enough to act as a guide. She shows visitors the Tragedy Pavilion, which lists 1,500 plague victims, most of them with the surname Wang. She describes how Unit 731 dropped plague-infected fleas from aircraft and how the disease worked its way through the village for months. It killed 20 villagers a day at one point in 1942, she says.
She leads visitors through the gray-brick Buddhist temple with bare concrete floors where, she says, the Japanese performed autopsies to gauge the impact of their tests.
And she fights, sometimes alone, to keep the case going.
At a community meeting one evening, plaintiffs needled Ms. Wang about the lack of tangible results. Ms. Wang, one person said, carries too much on her own shoulders. Ultimately, some said, the government in Beijing must press Tokyo on their behalf.
Mr. Wang slowly rubbed the bridge of her nose as they spoke. She explained that the court appeal was still their best hope. Beijing, with its trade priorities, is unlikely to start cooperating, she said: there is no quick fix.
"If we wait for governments to settle this matter," Ms. Wang said afterward, "we will die and the truth will never come out."

Worried U.S. Says Personnel In Jordan May Leave

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
The State Department today authorized all nonemergency employees and the families of diplomats at its embassy in Jordan to leave the country, one of America's closest allies in the Middle East, because of heightened concerns about terrorism, officials said. 
 The decision stems from the killing of Laurence Foley, a senior administrator for the United States Agency for International Development, who was shot in his front yard in Amman last month. 
 Jordanian authorities have not made any arrests in the case, and the motive for the shooting remains unclear, officials said. 
But State Department officials said the killing, one of a string of recent attacks against Westerners in the Middle East, had unnerved embassy personnel and raised broad concerns about possible future attacks against American officials in the country. 
"We have no new specific threats for Jordan," said Philip Reeker, the deputy State Department spokesman, "but this general decision results from our overall assessment of the security situation as it applies to official Americans. We think it's a prudent measure."
Mr. Reeker said that he did not know how many embassy officials were likely to leave the country, but that the departures would not affect essential embassy services.
On Thursday, two American soldiers were shot and wounded in Kuwait by a policeman, while in Lebanon an American evangelist was killed by an unknown assailant.
The announcement today was included in a travel warning to alert Americans "to carefully consider the risks of travel to Jordan." State Department officials said they were also working with Jordanian officials on protection for Americans in Jordan, though they declined to discuss specifics.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the American ambassador to Jordan, Edward Gnehm, informed King Abdullah II of the warning by telephone today.
Jordanian officials said they regretted the action but did not think it would hurt relations. 
"We can appreciate the U.S.'s concern for the safety of their diplomats and citizens all over the world," said Mohammad Adwan, the minister of state for political affairs, "but we strongly believe that Jordan is still one of the safest and most secure countries in the world that protects all its foreign guests."
American officials said they did not know of any plans to authorize the voluntary departure of embassy officials in Kuwait, Lebanon or other Middle Eastern countries as a result of the recent shootings. The officials said Jordan was considered exceptional because many of the American diplomats there have families with them.
But one official said future moves would hinge on the outcome of the criminal investigations. "If there was a revelation that this is a new tactic by a single terrorist entity," the official said, "there would be policy implications."

HEADLINE: Washington Talk; 
Changing of Republican Budget Guard Could Create Waves

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
Except for Washington insiders, few people know of Lindy L. Paull, Dan L. Crippen and G. William Hoagland. But over the years, these behind-the-scenes Republican staff assistants in Congress may have had more influence over the government's tax and budget policy than any elected official or presidential appointee.
 Now, Ms. Paull, chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, and Mr. Crippen, director of the Congressional Budget Office, are leaving the government. Mr. Hoagland, Republican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee, is changing jobs. 
 The question being asked throughout the Capitol and in the institutes that track budget and tax matters is whether the officials who replace Ms. Paull, Mr. Crippen and Mr. Hoagland -- none have been named yet -- will mainly be honest evaluators of tax and budget policy or primarily facilitators of the Republican political agenda.
The three who are leaving were squarely in the camp of honest brokers. Year after year, they spoke their minds and resisted all efforts to alter their designs to fit the latest Republican fashions. 
For example, Republican leaders were furious this year when Mr. Crippen said publicly that the federal budget would still show a surplus if not for the president's $1.35 trillion tax cut.
Ms. Paull directed the staff of tax experts who project the specific amount of revenue to be gained or lost by every proposed change in the tax law. Mr. Crippen was in charge of the staff of economists who regularly issue forecasts of the state of the economy and of the budget surplus or deficit that can be expected.
Mr. Hoagland spent two decades as a budget aide to Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on the Budget Committee. Lawmakers and staff members in both parties agree that no one else has his sense of history of budget battles over the years.
Most irritating to Republican leaders, the three rejected the approach held by many Republicans with an almost religious fervor that measurements of the budgetary effect of changes in the tax law should take account of the degree to which they can be expected to strengthen or weaken the overall economy. In budget lexicon, this is called dynamic scoring.
Under the current system, if tax rates are cut by 10 percent, it is assumed that revenues would fall by 10 percent. But under dynamic scoring, the assumption would be that revenues would fall by only, say, 7 percent, since the tax cuts would strengthen the economy and revenues from the additional income that would result would partly offset the receipts lost from the lower tax rates.
Most Democrats and some Republicans say this is madness. They say it is impossible to calculate the overall economic effect of tax changes with any degree of confidence and thus better not to try to calculate it at all.
No one around Congress doubts that the aides who replace the three who are leaving will be advocates of dynamic scoring. The disagreement is over what difference this will make. 
Until recently, Congress operated under what were called pay-go rules, meaning that every tax cut had to be offset by an equivalent tax increase or spending reduction. So the calculation of the budgetary effect of proposed tax cuts was critical. 
But the pay-go rules have expired, and the new Republican-led Congress is unlikely to reinstate them. So the main effect of dynamic scoring might simply be to make Republican tax proposals look more attractive politically.
None of the three were explicitly forced out of their jobs, though they might have stayed in other circumstances. Mr. Hoagland is quitting his job on the Budget Committee staff because Mr. Domenici is leaving to become chairman of the Energy Committee. 
Mr. Hoagland, 55, who except for two years has worked for Congress since 1975, will become a special assistant on budget matters to Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader. 
The word in Republican circles is that Mr. Lott hired Mr. Hoagland to keep an eye on Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, who will be the new chairman of the Budget Committee and who is Mr. Lott's political rival.
Ms. Paull, who turned 54 today and who has been a Congressional tax expert since 1986, has told friends that she plans to work for PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm, at a salary, no doubt, many times what she has been paid by Congress.
Mr. Crippen's four-year term as director of the budget office expires in January, and Republican leaders have no interest in reappointing him. A protege of Howard H. Baker Jr., the former Senate Republican leader, Mr. Crippen, 50, has not looked for a new job, his spokeswoman said. She said he felt it would be a conflict of interest to do job interviews while he still worked for Congress, reflecting a sensitivity rarely practiced in Washington.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR FEARS; 
North Korea Says It Will Bar Fuel Inspectors

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
North Korea said today that it would refuse to allow foreign experts into the country to verify that American fuel supplies were being used for peaceful purposes. 
 On Thursday, North Korea said the 1994 agreement to prevent it from producing nuclear weapons had collapsed. It accused the United States of destroying the pact, known as the Agreed Framework. Under the agreement, experts are allowed to verify that shipments of fuel oil to North Korea are used only for peaceful purposes. 
 The two North Korean statements were an angry response to a decision last week by the United States and its main regional allies, Japan and South Korea, to suspend delivery of fuel supplies to North Korea provided by the framework in punishment for the North's secret nuclear weapons development program. 
In its first statement on the dispute, on Thursday, North Korea said that supplying fuel was the only one of four articles of the framework that the United States had ever respected. Citing what it claimed was unwavering American hostility, the North Korean statement said a "proposal for concluding a nonaggression treaty is, in essence, the only realistic solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula." 
The mounting showdown began in early October when American diplomats confronted North Korean officials with intelligence reports showing that it had violated the framework by secretly importing equipment needed to produce highly enriched uranium, which could be used in its nuclear weapons program. 
North Korean officials reportedly acknowledged an atomic weapons program, but argued that it was justified by American threats. 
The Agreed Framework was negotiated during a crisis that had led to preparations for war, after North Korea refused to open its Soviet-era, plutonium-based nuclear reactors for inspection. Under the framework, North Korea agreed to shut down the plutonium reactors and to allow inspections in exchange for fuel supplies and the construction of replacement reactors. 
In theory, the abandonment of the agreement would put the two countries back on their original collision course, with North Korea free to use the plutonium supplies from its mothballed reactors to produce nuclear weapons, rather than waiting for the much more cumbersome and lengthy uranium process. 
Since the existence of the nuclear weapons program became known, the United States and its regional allies have struggled to come up with measures to force North Korea to abandon the project. Last week, they agreed to suspend indefinitely deliveries of heavy fuel oil, which the United States had agreed to provide at the rate of 500,000 tons annually. 
After some initial tough talking, the United States has recently spoken with a more measured tone about North Korea. Regional analysts say, however, that the moderation stems from a lack of means to influence North Korean behavior. 
Neither overt military threat nor an economic embargo on a country that has endured repeated famines are likely to be supported by China or Russia, and perhaps not even by South Korea and Japan. The United States does not maintain diplomatic relations with North Korea, and their contacts are essentially limited to the consortium that provides fuel oil and a program that allows searches for the remains of American soldiers who died in the Korean War. 
The suspension of the oil deliveries may have far less of an effect than had been anticipated. Peter Hayes, director of the Nautilus Institute, a United States-based research group with energy-related experience in North Korea, said his agency estimated that American-supplied fuel may provide only about 2 percent of the country's energy. 
Some foreign diplomats based in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, also doubted that the cutoff would cause an abrupt falloff of power, simply because North Koreans long ago adjusted to life without heat and with little electricity. 
"When you walk down the corridors in schools and hospitals in the winter, it is colder inside than outside," said Masood Hyder, the chief United Nations representative in Pyongyang. "Even in the meetings with senior officials in these palatial settings, it is very, very cold. When we stay in government guest houses in the winter, the toilets are freezing over." 
Japan and South Korea have vigorously lobbied the United States to maintain the Agreed Framework, citing reasons ranging from concern over being within striking range of a missile attack to a financial stake in building the replacement reactors. South Korea also feels an intense emotional bond with the North. 
Using language that virtually echoed recent statements from North Korea, South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, today urged the United States and North Korea to find common ground. "North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons program and when that happens, the United States should guarantee the North's right to exist," he said. 
In Tokyo today, the South Korean unification minister, Jeong Se Hyun, said North Korea's latest moves were "part of an ongoing psychological battle," rather than the end of the Agreed Framework. 
Even as it urges restraint, however, Japan is exploring the limits of another kind of pressure on North Korea. For weeks, the two countries have been locked in negotiations over the fate of five survivors and their families among 13 Japanese kidnapped by North Korea a quarter century ago. With passions running high here, Japan has privately insisted on settlement of the problem before it resumes food aid, which it had halted this year.
"We have enough food to feed the most critically needy people for one month," said one international relief official. "We are saying please don't insist that the starvation of a child somewhere in North Korea has something to do with the abduction issue."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Walker and Williams Thwart 5-Player Deal

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Three children and a 3 percent interest rate combined yesterday to doom the Colorado Rockies' latest attempt to shed a large contract from their payroll.
 The Rockies, who last Monday traded pitcher Mike Hampton and his huge contract, had worked out a conditional trade the next day to send right fielder Larry Walker to the Arizona Diamondbacks for third baseman Matt Williams and three other players. Walker and Williams have no-trade provisions in their contracts, and the teams had until 4 p.m. yesterday to secure their waivers of the provisions. But both players refused to approve the deal. 
 For Williams, the stumbling block was his three children; for Walker, it was the 3 percent interest rate at which Arizona wanted him to defer half of his 2004 and 2005 salaries.
As a result, the teams will not make the five-player trade.
"I see no reason for us to continue to pursue this proposed deal with Colorado since we were unable to reach an accord with Larry Walker and his representative," Joe Garagiola Jr., the Arizona general manager, said in a statement.
Williams, who is 36 and had one year left on his contract at $10 million, balked at the move because his children, ages 10, 11 and 12, live with him and his second wife in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale, and he did not want to leave them for a greater part of the season or uproot them.
"I'm a father first and a baseball player second," he said in a conference call. "I made a decision that's best for my children and my relationship with them."
He added, "Baseball is what I do, not who I am."
The Diamondbacks' attempt to lure Walker, 35, to Arizona broke down because their proposed change in his contract was not acceptable to him or the players association. The Diamondbacks wanted Walker to defer $6.25 million in each of the last two years of his contract at 3 percent interest. His contract already called for him to defer $6 million at 5.14 percent next season.
"That's a contract he negotiated," Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said. "If they want him to add more deferred to get a lower value, that's a renegotiation, and we will not authorize anything that pays less than 7 percent interest."
The Rockies do not plan to try to trade Walker elsewhere even though he is owed $38.5 million for the three years left on his contract and they are trying to reduce their payroll.
"We're probably not going to try to do anything else," Josh Byrnes, the Rockies' assistant general manager, said from Denver. "It was sort of a fit for all parties. He had a chance to play for a club that was more legitimately a contender, and we could have filled some holes and become younger and more affordable."
The Rockies and the Diamondbacks were said to be upset that Walker did not return calls from Jerry Colangelo, the Diamondbacks' managing partner, who wanted to discuss the deferred money
Pat Rooney, Walker's agent, did not return a call seeking comment.
The Rockies were discouraged by Walker's stance on the trade because Arizona was first on the list of teams he said he would consider going to. The Mets, who have talked with the Rockies about Denny Neagle, another high-priced pitcher they want to trade, were not on Walker's list.
Walker and Williams have missed a significant number of games in recent seasons because of injuries. The Diamondbacks wanted to trade Williams because they do not expect him to be their regular third baseman next season. But Williams said, "I anticipate going to spring training and fighting for the third-base job."
This is not the first time Williams has made a career decision because of his children. After the 1997 season the Cleveland Indians traded him to the expansion Diamondbacks so he could be near his children.
First baseman Erubiel Durazo, outfielder David Dellucci and relief pitcher Bret Prinz would also have gone to the Rockies in the trade.

PERSON: Lynda Van Devanter 

HEADLINE: Lynda Van Devanter, Nurse Who Became Chronicler of Her Wartime Pain, Dies at 55 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Lynda Van Devanter, whose pained account of her life as an Army nurse in Vietnam focused attention on the burdens of American servicewomen in the war, died on Nov. 15 at her home in Herndon, Va. She was 55. 
 At the Vietnam Veterans of America, where Ms. Van Devanter founded and administered a project dealing with the concerns and complaints of the 7,465 women who had served in Vietnam, a spokesman said she had long been ill with a vascular disease that she attributed to wartime exposure to chemical agents. 
 "She had an Agent Orange claim that we will continue to pursue for her daughter, Molly," said the spokesman, Rick Weidman. 
Ms. Van Devanter's memoir was "Home Before Morning" (Beaufort Books, 1983), which helped inspire the television series "China Beach." In it, she wrote of her transformation in 1969 from "an all-American girl" and idealistic supporter of the war into an overworked, confused nurse at the 71st Evacuation Hospital in Pleiku, where the gore and horrors of war were constantly before her.
She wrote of surgeons' sometimes working drunk on alcohol or high on drugs; of overburdened nurses and medics who sought release not only in liquor but also in marijuana and desperate if casual relationships; of the way her early pro-war enthusiasm waned amid the blood and casualties. Her experience was so alarming to her that the most pleasurable work she could later recall was her assignment to help a leper colony of Vietnamese.
And then, after a year, it was over.
Her tour of duty in Vietnam completed, Lieutenant Van Devanter returned to the United States to continue her service, only to discover another kind of pain.
"Somewhere between 1945 and 1970, words like bravery, sacrifice and valor had gone out of vogue," she wrote. "When I returned to my country I began to learn a very bitter lesson. In the eyes of most Americans, the military services had no more heroes, merely baby-killers, misfits and fools." 
After her discharge she worked as a nurse in several civilian hospitals, but failed to free herself of the traumas inflicted by Vietnam. She later described her work record as spotty and her relationships as tormented and unfulfilling. She drank heavily, she said, and cried continually. 
"I was on unemployment and food stamps and in therapy," Ms. Van Devanter said in an interview in 1981. "But I never told my therapist I was in Vietnam. That's how deeply I buried it." 
Then one night in 1979, while visiting friends on eastern Long Island, she was awakened by a siren from a nearby volunteer firehouse. It made the same sound as the alert that had signaled rocket and mortar attacks on Pleiku, and Ms. Van Devanter found herself compulsively crawling out of the house.
That led her to enlist in a counseling program known as "walking through Vietnam," which in turn led her to write her memoir and to focus attention on the concerns of female veterans.
At the outset of the book, which she wrote with Christopher Morgan, she said she had initially tried "to exorcise the Vietnam War from my mind and heart." In the process, she said, she learned that she wanted not to obliterate her memories but rather to show "that the war doesn't have to own me, I can own it."
She dedicated her book in part to "all of the unknown women who served forgotten in their wars." When it appeared in 1983, it provoked a sharp dispute between Vietnam War nurses who claimed that the accounts of partying, drinking and drug use were exaggerated and those who insisted that the descriptions were accurate. 
The critics, who called themselves Nurses Against Misrepresentation, or Nam, complained that Ms. Van Devanter's account could leave relatives of dead soldiers believing that their kin had not received the best possible treatment.
But others jumped to the author's defense. One, Winnie Smith, has written that she was close to suicide when she recognized the demons of her own traumatic stress after reading "Home Before Morning." That experience led her to write her own book in 1992, "American Daughter Gone to War." 
Ms. Van Devanter established the Women's Project at the Vietnam Veterans of America, overseeing studies that underscored her view that though Vietnam veterans in general were "a forgotten minority," the women who had served as nurses were "the most forgotten." 
She cited complaints she gathered that no women had been included in studies on the effects of the defoliant Agent Orange and that veterans' hospitals provided no gynecological or obstetrics clinics. 
Ms. Van Devanter, a native of Arlington, Va., is survived by her husband, Tom Buckley, and their daughter, Molly; a stepdaughter, Brigid Buckley of Raleigh, N.C.; and Ms. Van Devanter's mother, Helen Van Devanter of Sterling, Va.

BROCADE SHARES DECLINE AFTER EARNINGS WARNING

BYLINE:  Dow Jones/AP 

 BODY:
 The stock of Brocade Communications Systems Inc. skidded yesterday after the company warned of a drop in profit and revenue in the the current quarter. 
Brocade said it expected to break even on revenue of $120 million to $125 million. Analysts had expected the company to post earnings of 7 cents a share on revenue of almost $157 million. The period, the company's fiscal first quarter, ends in January. Brocade, based in San Jose, Calif., also said it would cut 12 percent of its work force, or about 150 employees. Brocade, a maker of hardware used in data storage networks, has been hurt by the economic downturn. Its shares fell $2, or 27 percent, to close at $5.28.

HEADLINE: Do We Have to Call You Al? 

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH; E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com

 BODY:
"Tomorrow night Liza Minnelli returns," said Larry King on Wednesday night. But while America held its breath, Al Gore was getting more airtime than "The Bachelor." You could wake up to him and Tipper on the "Today" show. You could drift off to dreamland watching him with Charlie Rose. The man who went AWOL in defeat was back -- to sell not one but two new books (Mr. Gore can leave no lily ungilded) and, of course, himself.
 The books celebrate The Family, the one cause every Democrat feels compelled to embrace after Monicagate. The reviews for the author are thumbs up. "He's even, if you can believe it, funny," said Barbara Walters. "I think you've gotten funnier in two years," gushed David Letterman to the former vice president. The new, post-wooden Gore is determined to be spontaneous if it kills him, and us. "I am just letting my hair down," he says, as in interview after interview he quotes a boomer mantra: "Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose." From now on, he is going to "just let it rip" and "let the chips fall where they may." Next month he's a host on "Saturday Night Live." 
 But it took Katie Couric all of three minutes to uncover the old Al Gore lurking inside the latest model. When he protested that he wouldn't really, really decide whether to run for president until after the holidays, she spoke for many viewers by responding, "Why am I having a hard time believing that wholeheartedly?" Then came the Gore equivocation and hair-splitting that he perfected in the 2000 debates. Ms. Couric had to ask seven questions to pin him down on how he would "handle Saddam" if he were president. The answer? He said that President Bush was taking "the right course of action" by winning a unanimous Security Council vote. And now what? "I don't know where this goes from here," said Mr. Gore.
People don't change. Mr. Gore doesn't let the chips fall where they may; you can still spot him counting each one before doling them out. And of course he is still running for president. Polls of Democratic voters and politicians alike show that he remains the first choice of a plurality of them, and besides, what else does the guy, a political lifer, have to do with himself? 
Republicans profess to be delighted at this prospect while non-Gore Democrats are despondent. They are united in their recognition that he is the least spontaneous presidential contender since Richard Nixon, who similarly kept rolling out "new" incarnations of his public persona after each defeat. But Nixon did bounce back, and from a worse setback than Mr. Gore's: He lost his own state even more embarrassingly, in a failed post-vice-presidency run for governor, and then threw a public temper tantrum to blame his own failings on the press. Six years later he took the White House anyway, at a time when the country and the party in power were both traumatized by a war without end. 
So many have written off our former vice president in 2002 that the conventional wisdom could be as wrong about him as it was about the former vice president of 1962. Yet if Mr. Gore -- or the tongue-tied party he all too perfectly embodies right now -- is going to be taken seriously by voters, "I don't know where this goes from here" will hardly do. 
What will? In the aftermath of the election, I received hundreds of e-mails from readers suggesting what Democrats might stand for today after standing for nothing brought them their Nov. 5 debacle. "It need not be such a complicated question," wrote one correspondent, cutting to the chase for many others. "Stand up honestly and courageously for workers, consumers, voters, investors, people who breathe air and drink water and eat food. Do what's best for them. Big business can take care of itself."
That traditional party ethic is embryonically reflected in the domestic policy staples emerging so far among pundits and most Democrats running for president, Mr. Gore included: some kind of universal health insurance (bothersome details and price tags to come during primary season), a fast Democratic tax cut for the non-rich in lieu of the slo-mo Bush windfall for the upper brackets, fights for the environment and civil liberties and against hard-right judicial appointments and corporate malfeasance. 
But none of it addresses the reality of post-election-November 2002, when each day brings news that Osama bin Laden and his minions are alive and hard at work, that the F.B.I.'s counterterrorism efforts remain slack and that the war on Saddam Hussein has started "in everything but name," as ABC News put it on Wednesday night. At a time like this, in the words of Heather Hurlburt of The Washington Monthly, "a party that comes across as unserious about national security is permanently vulnerable, no matter how compelling its vision of domestic policy." 
Not every Democratic politician is unserious about national security. John Kerry and Joe Lieberman notwithstanding, the most urgent voice this fall is that of Bob Graham of Florida, the outgoing chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Working from two realistic premises -- that it's likely "we've only got about 60 days" before the Iraq war starts for keeps and that Saddam will pull every terrorist lever he can once it does -- Senator Graham has been demanding concrete action, especially from an F.B.I. that he discovered still had not completed a strategic plan for coping with terrorism within the United States, first ordered up by Congress in 1999. 
He further warns that Hezbollah and Hamas are at least as threatening as Al Qaeda to Americans both at home and abroad, especially once the war on Iraq is fully joined. In league with his Republican counterpart on the Intelligence Committee, Richard Shelby, he calls for the war on terror to be extended without further delay, whether by diplomacy or force, to Hezbollah training camps in Iran, Syria and the Syrian-controlled areas of Lebanon. He dismisses the bipartisan self-congratulation about Washington's panacea, a new Department of Homeland Security that may not be up and running for years and that even then will exclude the F.B.I. and C.I.A. "I don't think we have the time in the next 60 days to be moving organizational charts around," Senator Graham told CNN, later observing that this chaotic bureaucratic shuffle may actually bring us "some degree of lessened domestic security" at the moment of greatest urgency.
There might yet be a Democratic foreign policy to complement a national security policy. But at this point an antiwar policy is hardly in the cards; the only party leader who voted against the war resolution, Nancy Pelosi, is so easily distracted by predictable attacks on her as a "San Francisco Democrat" that she is too busy defending her own family bona fides (five children, five grandchildren) to say much coherent about Iraq or anything else. 
"The Democrats should start standing up for certain core principles that were historically Democratic principles under Truman, F.D.R., J.F.K. and, for that matter, Clinton," proposes Richard Holbrooke, the Clinton ambassador to the United Nations. "Democrats should go back to advocating strong support for democracy and human rights. Nor should they be afraid to use power to defend either American interests or values." Another core Democratic principle, as Mr. Holbrooke has long pointed out, is that America should seek to strengthen the U.N. -- an approach that polls consistently show most Americans support. But such was the desperation of Democratic leaders to "move on" from Iraq and talk about the economy during the campaign that it is Colin Powell and Tony Blair, not they, who are now identified with pushing the administration toward the tough Security Council resolution it at first so strenuously resisted.
But the Democrats who signed on to this war have an opening now to stake out a position on where and how it will end. The Bush administration is internally conflicted on this crucial point -- witness the mixed signals and frightening disarray in post-Taliban Afghanistan. When will we have won the war on Saddam? What kind of nation-building are we in favor of, and at what sacrifice? What is Plan B if the Middle East doesn't fall into place after regime change in Baghdad? The list of questions crying out for Democratic answers is as long as the list of fears that shadow America during holiday season 2002. At the very least Mr. Gore, the only Democrat to command a media spotlight at this pivotal moment, might speak up about "where this goes from here" rather than playing peek-a-boo about where he goes from here. Even if he is on hold, history is not.

HEADLINE: House Passes Final Details For Creating Security Dept. 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
The House gaveled itself and the 107th Congress to conclusion today, approving the details of a Homeland Security Department in a final round of dispute over special-interest provisions and assistance to the unemployed.
 The bill to create the domestic security department had been approved by the House last week, and by the Senate on Tuesday. But before it could be sent to President Bush for his signature, a few technical discrepancies between the bills had to be corrected, like different names on section headings in the text and the bill number itself. The required votes on those matters in the House today gave opponents of the bill from both sides of the aisle an opportunity for a final blast, and for a few minutes it seemed as if Democrats might break a promise and refuse to send the bill to the White House. 
 Many of those Democrats were angry that House Republican leaders refused to take up a Senate bill that would extend unemployment benefits past Dec. 28. On that day, benefits will run out for 800,000 people, and 95,000 more people will lose their benefits each succeeding week.
The House and Senate had each passed bills to extend the benefits, but the Senate's was far more generous than the House's, and neither could be approved until the two houses agreed on the amount. 
With each side trying to score points, no extension was possible, and today several senior Democrats gathered on the House floor in a last-ditch effort to take advantage of the absence of all but a handful of members. Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking minority member of the Appropriations Committee, said he was considering blocking the security bill if Republicans would not extend the jobless benefits. Republicans, Mr. Obey noted, had no problem inserting a last-minute provision protecting drug companies from vaccine lawsuits.
"In a way, this bill is a fitting end to a pitiful and neglectful Congress," he said. "I find it outrageous that the Congress is going to find room in its heart to help the poor downtrodden drug companies, but will not find room in their hearts to deal with the problems of the long-term unemployed."
Had Mr. Obey objected to the technical change in the bill's number, the department could not have been signed into law. House leaders would have been faced with two unpalatable courses of action: either delay approval of the department until next year or call all House members back. Mr. Obey would also have broken a promise by Democratic leaders that none of their party colleagues would object to the change.
Calling Mr. Obey's bluff, Representative Dick Armey, the House Republican leader, said he could not authorize the approval of the jobless benefits without his members present. That led to a few Democratic comparisons of Republicans with Ebenezer Scrooge, but ultimately Mr. Obey and his colleagues decided to join the rest of the House in leaving Washington without an unemployment benefits extension. They could not, after all, have stopped the Homeland Security Department for long, and the anger such a move would cause would make it certain that Republicans would not agree to the jobless aid.
The other objection to the bill today came from an unlikely source: Representative Dan Burton of Indiana, a conservative Republican who heads the House Government Reform Committee. Mr. Burton has a grandchild with autism that he believes was caused by a mercury-based preservative in vaccines, and he attacked a provision in the bill that would protect the makers of the preservative from legal damages.
"I'm probably the last guy you'd see up here talking about this," he said, "but I want to tell you something, government has to have a heart as well as being a guardian of the pocketbook. And with parents who have children who are autistic and suspect they've been damaged by vaccines or mercury, they ought to have some recourse. And right now they have virtually none."
In the end, however, Mr. Burton, like the Democrats, realized that his objection could not stop the Homeland Security Department bill, which President Bush is scheduled to sign into law on Monday. Mr. Burton said he hoped that Republican leaders would live up to a promise to change the vaccine provision in the next Congress, and he took his autism charts and went home to Indiana.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Big Mexican Cellphone Company Moves Into Brazil

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH MALKIN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
Domination of its rapidly growing home market has made America Movil the largest wireless telephone company in Latin America. Now it is charging into Brazil, where it faces much fiercer competition. 
 America Movil won an auction on Tuesday for three mobile phone licenses in Brazil, including one covering the most prized market, metropolitan Sao Paulo, with a $120 million bid. Adding the three licenses to its patchy existing network in Brazil will allow America Movil, controlled by the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helu, to offer service in most of the country, the continent's largest, and to compete with services owned by deep-pocketed European rivals that already have extensive geographic coverage. 
 Together, Brazil and Mexico represent more than three-fifths of the Latin American wireless phone market. With nearly an 80 percent share already in its hands in Mexico, America Movil has been looking to make its mark in Brazil, and it spent some $570 million there in the first half of the year. 
How the expansion fares will be an important test for Daniel Hajj, the chief executive and Mr. Slim's son-in-law. In Mexico, the only rival with the cash and expertise to offer a significant challenge is Telefonica Moviles of Spain, a distant No. 2, with 2.2 million subscribers to America Movil's 19.4 million. But in Brazil, America Movil is the challenger, and as many as four major providers contest each of the 10 service regions.
Telefonica Moviles, in a new joint venture with Portugal Telecom, is the overall leader in Brazil with 13 million subscribers. Telecom Italia Movil is in second place, with about five million customers. America Movil has almost the same number, but Telecom Italia Movil offers a more sophisticated technology throughout the country. The European-owned companies are spending heavily to compete in Latin America despite the recent weakness of the local currencies. 
All the players are after the same prize that America Movil executives see in Brazil: immense growth potential.
"If you look at the percentage of people in Latin America who are younger than 15 years old, it's more than double what it is in Europe," said Carlos Garcia Moreno, America Movil's chief financial officer, in an interview at the company's modest headquarters in an industrial district of Mexico City. "So the demographics help. It's a game of penetration in an expanding universe, which isn't what you have in Europe or the United States." 
Some 100 million Latin Americans now have mobile telephones, according to Pyramid Research, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. The figure is expected to grow to 165 million by 2007, meaning that one person in three will have a mobile phone in five years' time. Right now the proportions are one in four in Mexico and one in six in Brazil, Mr. Garcia Moreno said. 
Latin America contrasts sharply with the major developed economies, where growth in wireless phone service has slowed markedly and companies are retrenching after overinvesting wildly in new licenses and new digital services in the late 1990's. The technology proved slow to meet expectations and even slower to generate interest among consumers, while prices for existing services were beaten down by intensifying competitive pressures. 
That bubble never reached Latin America, where more than half the population lives in poverty and for many people, cellphones are their first phones. 
"In this part of the world, voice alone will support many more years of growth," Mr. Garcia Moreno said. 
Even so, as cellphone service has grown from a toy for the elite into a necessity for the masses, the amount of revenue to be had from each subscriber has plummeted from $61 a month in 1998 to only $17 a month now, according to Leslie Arathoon of Pyramid Research. 
Economic growth and rising incomes will stem the fall in revenue per subscriber, analysts say. In Latin America, wireless data service will remain a niche application for the wealthy, Ms. Arathoon said, but basic voice service and simple extras like voice mail and text messaging will encourage more phone use among the majority.
To sidestep the credit problems associated with serving a low-income population, Latin American mobile phone operators offer service using prepaid cards similar to long-distance calling cards, good for a set number of minutes of calling. The plans are popular with customers, who like having careful control over the amount they spend on the phone. Telcel, America Movil's Mexican operation, pioneered the use of prepaid cards in 1996, and they quickly caught on elsewhere.
Telcel began life as a unit of Telefonos de Mexico, known as Telmex, the dominant Mexican land-line telephone company, which Mr. Slim has controlled for more than a decade. Telmex combined Telcel with Telmex's operations outside Mexico and spun them off as America Movil at the end of 2000. Besides Mexico and Brazil, the company has wireless operations in Colombia, Ecuador and Guatemala, and a license to begin operating in Nicaragua. 
In part because it was assigned none of Telmex's debts in the spinoff, America Movil has been hugely profitable so far. The company posted $1.9 billion in net income on revenue of $4 billion for the first nine months of 2002. Sales grew 27.9 percent from the comparable period in 2001.
But some analysts say it will have trouble matching that record in Brazil. In Mexico, they say, the company's astute marketing and rigorous cost controls have been augmented by an ingredient that will be hard to replicate quickly elsewhere: Mr. Slim's wide and longstanding political contacts. It has nothing like that kind of power in Brazil, a more heavily regulated market where it got its first toehold only two years ago.
It will also have to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to update its existing operations and build out its network in the territory covered by the new licenses. To finance that, it has had to borrow, and its debts now total $3.8 billion.
"It's a highly competitive market, and they're starting in the back of the pack," said Stephen H. Graham, a telecommunications analyst at UBS Warburg in Rio de Janeiro. "They need to spend the money, focus, upgrade the technology and unify the brand."

Ukraine's Leader Loses NATO Alphabet Shuffle

BYLINE:  By PETER S. GREEN 

DATELINE: PRAGUE 

 BODY:
Ukraine's embattled president, Leonid Kuchma, was ritually humiliated at the tail end of this week's expanded summit meeting of NATO, in a deft exercise in diplomatic etiquette. 
 Facing strong criticism from the United States and other alliance members over suspicions that he had personally approved the sale of sophisticated radars to Iraq, and over growing unrest about his strong-arm rule, NATO publicly refused to invite Mr. Kuchma to the summit meeting here. 
 Mr. Kuchma crashed the party anyway, and when he showed up to take his country's place at a conference of the 46-nation Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, NATO officials realized that the alphabetical seating plan would have the Ukrainian leader rubbing elbows with Tony Blair, prime minister of the United Kingdom, and just a seat away from President Bush, of the United States.
Swift-thinking NATO officials quickly shifted to the alliance's forgotten second official language, French. Suddenly, "Ukraine" found itself at the end of the row, with only "Turquie" alongside. 
Mr. Bush and the "Etats-Unis d'Amerique" were a safe distance away, as was Mr. Blair, now referred to as "premier ministre" of the "Royaume Uni." 
Mr. Kuchma's presence at the meeting this morning was more than just a dinner table irritant. American and British officials have spent several weeks in Ukraine investigating accusations that Mr. Kuchma was personally involved in the $100 million sale of an advanced Kolchuga radar system to Iraq this year. 
"From the perspective of the United States, international politics today is about the war on terrorism and nothing else," said Charles Kupchan, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. 
"And with the sense that Ukraine may have sold radars to Iraq, it raises big questions about Ukraine's position in NATO." 
Mr. Kuchma's crackdown on political opposition has added to the international disapproval, and made him unwelcome in most European capitals. 
Earlier this year, a court in Kiev opened an investigation of Mr. Kuchma in connection with a variety of crimes, including allegedly ordering the murder of a journalist, Heorhiy Gongadze, two years ago. 
Experts say that simply by virtue of its size and its population of 50 million, Ukraine will eventually form a closer partnership with NATO -- but not under Mr. Kuchma. 
The prospect of public humiliation seems to have had no effect on Mr. Kuchma, whose clever manipulation of Ukraine's complex and corrupt politics and economics has kept him in power for nearly eight years. 
"Even if he is internationally isolated and he is involved in arms deals with Iraq and so on, he is still in control in Ukraine," said Jan Maksymiuk, an Eastern European expert with Radio Free Europe here. 
Mr. Kuchma was not the only unwelcome guest at the summit meeting. The Czech authorities refused to grant a visa to the Belarussian dictator, Aleksandr Lukashenko, after which Mr. Lukashenko threatened to unleash a tide of crime and prostitution on the West.

HEADLINE: Hardest-Hit Small Businesses to Get Leftover 9/11 Aid 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
As the deadline approaches for aid requests to the biggest grant program helping small businesses recover in Lower Manhattan, a state agency said yesterday that any leftover money would probably be added to the grants already given to the businesses "most severely impacted" by last year's terror attack.
 About $80 million has yet to be distributed, and some critics of the program welcomed what they said was the firmest indication yet of how any leftover money would be used. Those critics had contended that the program had not given enough to the hardest-hit small businesses -- mostly those that were in the World Trade Center. They expressed satisfaction, however, that the agency's statement indicated that the businesses that were obliterated when the towers fell would get more help than those nearby, which suffered more from street closings, lost revenue and other factors. 
 But other critics said the statement by the agency, the Empire State Development Corporation, was too vague. Over all, complaints about deficiencies in the program have been made by elected officials, owners of companies that were in the trade center and businesses that are elsewhere in Lower Manhattan. But many grant recipients have praised it as extremely helpful.
The program, the World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant Program, provides compensation for lost revenue to companies from 14th Street to the Battery with up to 500 employees.
Yesterday's statement came in response to a letter that Senator Charles E. Schumer sent on Thursday to Charles A. Gargano, the state agency's chairman.
The letter said as many as 200 small businesses that had been in the trade center, and were "still struggling to stay afloat" in new or temporary quarters, and needed aid beyond that offered under the program.
In responding to the letter, a spokesman for Mr. Gargano said that if any of the program's $481 million remained after the last grants were awarded to businesses that had applied by the Dec. 31 deadline, "we are predisposed to providing additional assistance to those businesses that were most severely impacted by the events of Sept. 11."
The spokesman, Michael Marr, said he could not estimate the amount of any additional aid that a company might receive. "We don't know how much we'll have left over, if anything," he said.
Senator Schumer said in his letter that any remaining money should also go to small businesses immediately around the trade center site that were so severely damaged that they have not reopened.
Yesterday, the senator said that he was grateful for the agency's position and that he looked forward to working with Mr. Gargano "to ensure that the people most hurt by this tragedy get the help they need."
Meyer Feig, president of the World Trade Center Tenants Association, which says it represents 100 small businesses that were in the center, also welcomed the agency's statement. But he said he wanted to know how the agency would decide which businesses were the hardest hit.
Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat representing portions of Manhattan and Queens, said the statement was not specific enough. "The World Trade Center tenants, whose businesses lost everything, need more than vague murmurings that those who lost the most might -- might -- get extra help," she said.
As of Nov. 15, Mr. Marr said, 10,322 businesses had received a total of $402.5 million of the $481 million earmarked for the program, leaving $78.5 million.
He said the agency and the city had begun an advertising campaign to tell Lower Manhattan businesses that still may not be aware of the program that they could be eligible. 
The program uses federal funds to pay for varying degrees of losses, depending on an applicant's proximity to the trade center site.
Thus, for the eligible businesses farthest away, between 14th and Houston Streets, the maximum compensation is three days' losses, while the highest reimbursement, 25 days' of losses, goes to businesses that were in the trade center or a nearby zone bounded by Chambers and Rector Streets on the north and south and Broadway and the Hudson River on the east and west.
The fact that businesses that were in the trade center are considered to have been in the same zone as those as far as five blocks away, and eligible for no more money than the others, has been a focus of the criticism.

'It's a Tenant's Market' for Offices in Fairfield County

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
OFFICE vacancy rates in Fairfield County, which were 6 or 7 percent in 2000, have now climbed well into double digits for the county as a whole. While vacancies have passed 20 percent in some pockets of Fairfield, the Greenwich office leasing market continues strong. Depending on which brokerage firm's statistics are used, office vacancy rates for the county over all are 16 percent or 17.9 percent.
 According to figures compiled by CB Richard Ellis, of 548 office buildings countywide containing a total of almost 45.3 million square feet, 5.2 million square feet are available on direct leases and 2.8 million are subleases from downsized companies. 
 "It's been as slow as I've seen it in 27 years," said Ed Tonnessen, an executive vice president at Albert B. Ashforth in Stamford. "It's a tenant's market, much softer than a couple of years ago. Prices have definitely fallen." Still, Mr. Tonnessen sees a glimmer of light in the darkness. "I'm sensing an uptick in demand," he said. 
The CB Richard Ellis statistics show that Stamford and Greenwich have a combined vacancy rate of 14 percent and that the sector with the lowest rate, 12.4 percent, is Eastern Fairfield, consisting of Bridgeport, Fairfield, Shelton, Stratford and Trumbull. Vacancies in Central Fairfield -- Darien, New Canaan, Norwalk, Westport and Wilton -- are up to 21 percent, and the rate is 20 percent in Upper Fairfield, which covers Brookfield, Danbury, Newtown and Ridgefield.
These figures are compatible with numbers from other brokerages, which vary slightly up or down, and they indicate what Kenneth M. Krasnow, senior managing director of the New York metropolitan region for Cushman & Wakefield, observed is "an increasingly fragmented market within the county," he said. "Greenwich is still red hot, off the charts," although brokerage figures show a vacancy rate of about 12 percent. He added, "Stamford is fairly quiet, concentrating on negotiations for 5,000 to 15,000 square feet" -- relatively small leases. 
"Eastern Fairfield, particularly Shelton, has been the most stable and active area of the county because of its affordable housing and easy commute," compared with commuting to Greenwich or Stamford, he said.
Some companies have been taking space in Shelton near employees who live there, creating a split between Lower Fairfield, where the executives live and have company headquarters, and Eastern Fairfield, site of satellite offices and lower-level personnel who cannot afford Lower Fairfield. "Eastern Fairfield is a desirable place to do business," said Dean J. Shapiro, executive director of the Stamford office of Insignia/ESG, "but not for corporate headquarters."
Equity Office, the largest property owner in the county, with more than 1.8 million square feet of office space, includes a 159,853 square foot building in Shelton among its eight buildings. The rest are in Stamford, most built by the F. D. Rich Company during Stamford's epic urban renewal 20 to 30 years ago. 
LIKE other owners, Equity Office is hunkering down. "To compete you have to offer two to four months free rent on perhaps a five-year term," said Thomas Q. Baake, senior vice president of Equity Office for the New York region. "Rent reductions from the mid-$40's a square foot in 2000 to the high $30's today represent a 10 to 15 percent drop." Asking rents in Norwalk, which has the highest vacancy rate, 24.3 percent, and other towns in the central and northern sectors have dropped from the low $30's to the high $20's. 
As for occupied buildings for sale, he continued, asking prices "are at an all-time high." He added, You've got money chasing yield, leveraged up with cheap debt, but that's not a game we're willing to play." While buildings have been selling briskly, largely to private investor groups disenchanted with Wall Street, his company has not been buying, because prices are so steep.
W&M Properties, like Office Equity, does not buy high. "We haven't found any offices we should be pursuing at this time," said Anthony E. Malkin, president of W&M. "Our entry point has been lower than prices available today." His company is runner-up to Equity Office in volume, owning 1.5 million square feet of offices in Fairfield County, 1.2 million of them in Stamford. Rents are in the mid-$30's, flat from a year ago.
On Nov. 5, W&M closed on the $33 million sale of its Soundview Plaza, a 180,000-square-foot Stamford office building built in 1984 at a cost of $25.2 million by Bruce Warwick, a former partner. The buyer is Mack-Cali, a publicly traded real estate investment trust.
The building is 94 percent leased by a hedge fund, a sports marketing firm, a capital management company and William Pitt Real Estate, among others. Tenants have a cafeteria on the premises in addition to free, exclusive use of an on-site fitness center, conference center, structured parking and shuttle service to the train station.
Proceeds from the sale will be used for property purchases under Section 1031 of the federal tax code, which allows a taxable gain to be deferred provided a replacement property is identified within 45 days of closing and the new purchase is completed within 100 days. "We will not be buying in Fairfield County," Mr. Malkin said. "We are looking at San Francisco."
W&M's signature Metro Center in Stamford is 100 percent leased, but Mr. Malkin said, "We are working with tenants who are leaving to find new tenants who will negotiate new leases." When existing tenants leave early, they pay a fraction of the remaining lease, but subleases are avoided and W&M keeps control of the space.
Jeffrey Dunne, senior vice president at CB Richard Ellis, represents sellers from Fairfield to Washington, D.C. "These are the lowest interest rates in my lifetime," he said "resulting in a lot of private capital looking for safety and return in buildings with good quality tenants and lease time of more than three years." Among the buildings he handles is Harbor Plaza, a 760,482-square-foot complex in five buildings in Stamford, marketed at $200 million. 
James C. Fagan, senior managing director of the tristate suburban area at CB Richard Ellis, predicts that the region's office market will start to pick up steam in mid-2003. "We are in a cycle of contractions and layoffs," he said, "a period of malaise when people are trying to conserve capital. But we are starting to pick up on commercial tenants out in the market -- consumer brand companies, financial services companies and hedge funds -- 85 percent of them looking for 15,000 feet or less. If you want 100,000 square feet, you can find it, but there are not a lot of options."
Except for UBS's nearly 1 million square foot headquarters, built in stages from the mid-90's until this year, new construction has been flat in the county for 10 years, and some developers holding approvals for office developments now have permission to alter their projects for apartments instead. Roseland Properties' plan for 495,000 square feet of offices and Archstone Properties' Mill River offices are among them. "Housing is catching up and correcting an imbalance with offices," said Richard W. Redniss, president of Redniss & Mead, a land use planning group. "We have a lot of commuters coming into Stamford. With more cost-effective housing, they would make a change," he said.
A somewhat unusual conversion to housing is under way at 133 Rowayton Avenue in Norwalk, where a 17,000-square-foot office building on 1.65 waterfront acres has been torn down to make way for four 4,000-square-foot condominium homes with large private docks for boats up to 50 feet. The first unit is expected to be ready for sale in January, priced at $3 million. 
While approved office buildings proposed by the Hines Company, the Dreyfus Company and others remain unbuilt for lack of tenant commitments, three new buildings have opened this year in the county, including the 225,000-square-foot 601 Merritt 7, the final addition to an existing five-building office park on Route 7 in Norwalk. In Stamford, Frank Mercede's new 67,000-square-foot, four-story building at 850 Canal Street is partially devoted to a design center, but 14,000 square feet of offices are available at $26 a foot. In Danbury most of the 35,000 square feet in a new building at 93 Lake Avenue are available. 
Christopher P. Bruhl, executive director of Sacia, the Southwestern Connecticut Area Commerce and Industry Association, said, "The phrase I hear most often from our members is, 'We're holding our own.' " Concerns over war with Iraq, the economy, terrorism and the stock market are accompanied by fear that an Indian casino might be built in Bridgeport. "Traffic would be generated to the degree that people could not get to work," he said. "Office vacancies would grow and businesses would not go to Shelton but would leave the state."

HEADLINE: On a Resume, Don't Mention Moon Pies or Water Cannons 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOEPPEL

 BODY:
WHEN MTV Networks advertised a junior-level editorial position that required a good eye for bad English, it was inundated with nearly 800 applications -- many riddled with typographical, grammatical and spelling errors.
 The incongruity is not quite so stark in other professions, but the job of wading through all that paper is every bit as frustrating. In one of the most competitive job markets in recent years, human-resources employees, recruiters and hiring managers say, nearly every opening in the metropolitan area is generating a deluge of resumes. And yet, for all the how-to resources available on the Internet and in bookstores, the submissions are often so amateurish they sometimes make Mimi O'Connor, MTV's editorial manager, want to "jump off the Brooklyn Bridge." 
 It isn't just the spelling mistakes, the recruiters say. It is also poor formatting, exotic fonts, unnecessary personal information and, worst of all, vague descriptions of professional achievements. Do not just write that you increased widget sales, experts say; say you increased them by 25 percent, or by $2 million.
Also, they say, the days of the one-size-fits-all resume are over; applicants should customize each to match the job opening.
"The biggest mistake that people are making is that their resumes have no real impact," said Martin Weitzman, president of Gilbert Career Resumes in Manhattan. "People need to establish their value. Many times accomplishments aren't defined or focused. A good resume won't get you a job, but it will get you in the door."
That is a crucial accomplishment these days, when even people with impressive job records and impeccable credentials can be lost in the shuffle.
Errors in spelling, typography and grammar topped the list of resume-writing sins singled out by 2,500 recruiters and headhunters in a survey by ResumeDoctor, a career-services company in Burlington, Vt. But incomplete contact information (some people actually forget to give their own names and phone numbers), wordiness and meaningless introductions also ranked high.
Some of the faux pas cited by these professionals, though extreme examples of how not to do it, can nonetheless be instructive. For example, one job hunter's statement that he sought a job that would be less likely to give him panic attacks than his old one and another applicant's request that her letter be disregarded if anyone within the company lacked a "pleasing personality," suggest that you should focus on what you can do for the prospective employer, not what the employer can do for you.
Similarly, personal information like one job seeker's description of himself as a "single, white male" (which prompted the hiring manager to ask, "Am I supposed to place him or date him?") and another's boast that he loved to play with his "17 children that resulted from 9 marriages" argues strongly for eliminating extraneous data.
Using e-mail addresses like sonofsatan, hotlips and imrbaby; enclosing a photo showing the applicant with his children or pets or, in one case, dressed in a tuxedo and sitting on a throne-like chair; listing achievements like "able to fit a whole Moon Pie in my mouth" and "getting shot 70 feet out of a water cannon"; and composing a resume in the form of a comic strip -- all of these tactics made poor impressions. Any form of cutesiness is generally a losing proposition.
And so is overenthusiasm, as in: "I am an electrifying, spirited, alluring, and amazing programmer who has been known to defy gravity, wrestle anacondas (and win), and type thousands of lines of error-free code with my left hand only."
Almost as bad is unintelligibility, like this buzzword-saturated job description: "As the Director of Strategic Sales, my charter focuses on catalyzing the relevant ecosystem to deliver optimized and synergized solutions to my strategic E.U. customers."
How to do it right? Think of yourself as a salesman with five seconds to make your pitch before a door is slammed in your face. "Whether you're a C.P.A., an electrical engineer or a nurse, you are your own product," said Michael Worthington, the operations manager at ResumeDoctor. "Some hiring managers get 200 to 300 resumes a day and will give yours exactly 5 to 10 seconds. You've got to give them the information they want on a silver platter."
Mr. Worthington recently received a 62-page treatise from a college professor that seemingly included every paper he had ever written. Had the professor highlighted his most impressive achievements in two pages, he would have received a better hearing, he said. Mr. Worthington recommends using a professional resume service, or at least getting another person to look at the material you plan to send employers.
Even diligent souls who use the spelling checker on their documents can make errors. Trudy Steinfield, the director of New York University's career services center, recently reviewed a personal trainer's resume that listed "personnel trainer" as the applicant's occupation. And Eric Bacolas, vice president for human resources at a large New York advertising agency, was surprised to read the claim that an applicant had bolstered employee "morals."
While being creative can sometimes score points with a prospective employer, it is generally not recommended. Dan Black, the tri-state director of campus recruiting for Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, says one applicant's decision to print his resume on blue paper with little white clouds only annoyed him.
Many resume experts say anything unrelated to job experience, professional organizations or education is a distraction, and they counsel omitting information about marital status, children, pets, religious affiliation or political leanings. Even listing hobbies can backfire, according to Mr. Weitzman of Gilbert Resumes. "If someone writes his hobbies are gymnastics or skiing, I'm going to think that this person is going to break his ankle and be out of work for six weeks," he said.
Some recruiters are less hard-nosed. Susie Kurtz, a Manhattan freelance recruiter for the advertising industry, once received baby shoes attached to a resume that said, "I want to get my foot in the door," and another time a box of seeds and a note that proclaimed, "I want to grow with your company." She found both to be clever tactics that helped differentiate the candidates from dozens of others.
"In some creative careers, there's more leeway in how a resume is written," she said.
Whatever the profession you are in, use terminology in your resume that shows a familiarity with what you do, experts say. If you are applying online for an accounting position, for example, make sure your resume contains the words "accountant" and "accounting" a few times.
Andrew Peck, a 31-year-old unemployed ad account executive in Manhattan, lards his resume with terms like "leveraging synergies" whose meaning he confesses is murky. That does not bother him; in his view, a resume is just a calling card.
"It's a first step, that proves your value in an industry and demonstrates that you're worth talking to," he said. "We live and die by a piece of paper that doesn't really reflect who we are."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey; 
Another Turnpike Exit as Industrial Destination

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
IN the realm of industrial real estate, Exit 8A off the New Jersey Turnpike has been a mega-star. Year after year, it has shown it has what it takes to make big deals happen: ample virgin land, great road connections and an accommodating attitude on the part of local officials.
 In the third quarter of this year, 8A continued to perform, with a highlight being the lease-up of two new speculative buildings. The last 140,000 square feet available at Keystone Property Trust's building on Prospect Plains Road in Cranbury was taken by an apparel wholesaler, SanMar. Also, the United States Postal Services committed to moving in next to an existing tenant, Petco, at Matrix Development's property on Englehard Drive in Monroe Township. 
 Still, market specialists now view 8A as an aging star, or a "market near saturation," as Stan Danzig, an executive director of Cushman & Wakefield, described it recently. There are no more million-square-feet plus sites to be had there, only smaller parcels, he said -- and the market has changed. 
Mr. Danzig and other market specialists said there has been a shift, to more demand for buildings designed to suit a particular tenant and less demand for speculatively built structures and second-hand space.
Enter, stage left, into that scenario, a starlet with a new kind of appeal -- about 7 million square feet of available "greenland" and a penchant for projects built to suit. Exit 7A, more than 13 miles south of 8A in Washington Township, has been charted by town planners to be solidly industrial on the east side of the turnpike, while residential and commercial development proceeds to the west of the major north-south artery.
Matrix owns a total of 10 million developable square feet at Exit 7A in its Northeast Business Park, 3 million square feet of it already developed, all as build-to-suit projects. The 1-million-square-foot Seaman's Furniture warehouse, built four years ago and visible from the turnpike near where it intersects with the east-wide Interstate 195, was one of the first buildings to go up.
"Our most recent deal is a 475,000-square-foot building we are doing for W. W. Grainger," said Matrix's chief operating officer, Alec Taylor. "We don't build them unless it is exactly what the company needs. The vacancy rate at 7A is zero."
By contrast, the overall vacancy rate for industrial property in northern and central New Jersey at the end of the third quarter was 6.6 percent, according to Cushman's latest report. The vacancy rate at Exit 8A, where there is a total of 35 million square feet of space, is 16 percent, according to Insignia/ESG.
Other industrial regions have been hit harder by the lagging economy than New Jersey has, Mr. Danzig said. In fact, Cushman's third-quarter report ranked the northern and central New Jersey market behind only Chicago in the amount of industrial square footage leased so far this year -- 17.3 million square feet. The Jersey market was ranked third, behind Dallas and Atlanta, in the amount of square footage sold so far this year, 5.7 million square feet.
Mr. Danzig explained the New Jersey market's strong showing by saying that large national development companies -- driven to deliver a certain amount of new construction each year -- have overbuilt in other states. But in New Jersey, Mr. Danzig said, the industrial market is still dominated by local developers.
Matrix, which is based in Cranbury, is a particularly "flexible and agile type of development company, set up to take on any kind of project and work with many different kinds of lenders," said Robert Sager, who is managing director of Insignia/ESG's industrial services group.
MATRIX operates as an interlocking group of partnerships, Mr. Sager said, and this means "their decision-making process is quicker than for most traditional companies," real estate investment trusts or pension funds. 
The reason that built-to-suit structures have begun to dominate, in Mr. Sager's view, is that companies are finding they must have modern, precisely designed warehouse or delivery buildings to stay competitive. 
Companies are finding that investing in construction of the right structure can save money over time, said Dan Frankel, a principal in Newmark Real Estate of New Jersey. "If a company has some time and is planning properly," he said, "it can wait for a build-to-suit rather than lease, reap the benefits from the economies of scale and spread the costs over 1 million to 2 million square feet."
Mr. Sager said: "Today, it's all about logistics. Logistics is the most important thing to these companies, in everything from raw materials to distribution. Traditionally, brokers would approach a company, ask 'How many square feet do you need?' and then say, 'O.K., I've got six buildings to show you.'
"Now, the companies all have logistics directors, and they're not so much looking to save 25 cents a foot on the rent, or $5,000 on the purchase of a building. That's not what makes them money; 85 percent of the money these companies earn is through logistics."
Mr. Sager offered the example of a company he recently worked with, which was looking for warehouse and distribution space in New Jersey or Pennsylvania. The company's product was manufactured in Chicago and shipped by rail to the Northeast.
"Rent -- which has remained pretty flat, at about $6.50 per square foot -- was not even talked about," Mr. Sager said. "The only issue was logistics. The company tells me they need 100,000 square feet, but if we can get three stories, then they might need 300,000. Depending on if the building is square or rectangular, the number of pallets goes up or down. If it's a 20-foot building, they can stack pallets four high; in a 38-foot building, they can stack six or seven high, but they need special sprinklers. With the high-bay building, they can have narrower aisles, but then they must have the special sprinklers. They mapped out how the flow would be laid out in the box, how the product would come in and go out."
Mr. Sager said companies want brokers to understand exactly how they do business and what design features will maximize the efficiency of their operations. "Seaman's warehouse is another example," he said. "Seaman's needed a building that was long and narrow, with tons of loading doors and parking. The land at Exit 8A was not the right configuration and, besides, it cost a little more, and they went to 7A."
Mr. Sager agreed with Mr. Danzig, who said, "The shortage of sites to accommodate especially large and unique requirements at Exit 8A has begun to drive activity south." 
Michael Nachamkin, a broker with Whitehall Industry Properties, disagreed somewhat. "There is still enough land at Exit 8A to prevent deals from going to the 7A market," he said. "The only advantage may be some large sites that can accommodate 750,000- to 1-million-square-foot buildings. Those kinds of sites are limited at Exit 8A."
The Matrix building at 8A that the Postal Service leased several months ago was a new building that had remained more than half vacant for almost two years. "That is because," Mr. Sager said, "while it's nice and new, it wasn't build-to-suit."
Mr. Taylor of Matrix said that 7A offers another significant advantage over 8A with its direct access to an east-west road. Both exits are ideally situated in the New York to Washington shipping corridor. And Exit 8A enjoys the advantage of being 14 minutes closer to New York City. 
"That 14 minutes doesn't seem so important when you're shipping across the country, though," said Mr. Taylor, "and the access to I-195, which connects to I-95, which connects to I-295, can be very important."
Mr. Taylor also pointed to what is seen as 7A's better access to the labor markets in Princeton, Hamilton, and Lawrence, as a result of the I-195 connection.

HEADLINE: For Birds (and Businesses), Happy Trails 

BYLINE:  By JOE WOJTAS

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT already has a wine trail, a freedom trail and an Impressionist art trail. Now bird watchers are getting their own trail.
 The State Department of Environmental Protection is developing a coastline bird trail that will include about 50 sites, and already tourism officials are seeing dollar signs. 
 The officials envision bird-watchers traveling to the state to see owls, eagles and American oystercatchers. They also see the visitors staying around to spend money in hotels, restaurants, shops and museums. 
"There's 71 million birders in America and they spend a lot money when they travel," said Deborah Donovan, the marketing director for Connecticut's Mystic and More Convention and Visitors Bureau, which promotes tourism in southeastern Connecticut. "How could we not love this idea? It's an undeveloped market we haven't even tapped yet."
Mary Woods, the communications director for the Coastal Fairfield County Convention and Visitors Bureau, said: "The demographics are very convincing. They'll travel here to see the birds, but then we'll get them to experience more when they are here."
As for those trying to protect the state's wildlife habitats, like Margarett Jones, the executive director of the Denison Pequotsepos Nature Center in Mystic, they see the trail as a way to show state officials the importance of preserving more open space. "Now we can show them why it's important," she said. "We can give them quantifiable numbers as to the impact of open space on the economy."
Jenny Dickson, a supervising wildlife biologist with the D.E.P., was attending a meeting in Texas a decade ago when she learned about the successful bird trail there.
"I thought this would be great for Connecticut," she said. "It's taken until now to get us to the point where we can start it."
Last year, the federal government awarded Connecticut a $50,000 grant to start the trail. The D.E.P. hired Fermata Inc., a Texas company that has created numerous birding, nature and historic trails around the world.
During the last week in October, Ted Eubanks Jr., Fermata's president, and Ms. Dickson held three meetings along the coastline to outline the project.
"This is just not about putting a lot of cute birding sites along a line on a map," Mr. Eubanks told a group of 35 tourism officials, business owners and bird enthusiasts who had gathered in Old Saybrook to learn about the project. "It far more important than that."
Mr. Eubanks said that 10 years ago he and some associates came up with the idea for a bird trail in Texas and now there are 18 other trails across the country, including in Oklahoma, Oregon and North Dakota. He said the trails have been an economic boon for the towns and cities where they are situated. 
The Great Texas Coastal Bird Trail attracts 70,000 people a year and a survey by Fermata has shown that the average person who visits spends an average of eight days on the trail and spends about $1,000.
Mr. Eubanks said people are seeking outdoor recreation, culture and historical activities since Sept. 11. As people become more centered in urban and suburban areas, he said they often find nature through hiking, camping and wildlife viewing.
"They want to reconnect," he said. "They want solace and safety."
Ms. Jones agreed, saying her center's programs were attracting large numbers of people.
"People want outdoor recreation opportunities where they can connect with the real thing," she said. "They don't want the Disney version. We are witnessing firsthand a nature tourism boom."
All this describes both avid and casual birders, who Mr. Eubanks said comprised the country's fastest growing outdoor recreation activity. He said that one out of every four Americans are birders even if they do not consider themselves one.
For those who scoffed at the estimate, Mr. Eubanks asked the Old Saybrook audience if any of them were birders. A few raised their hands. When he asked if any of them watch birds at feeders in their yard, more than half raised their hands.
"Birders are people who find their way to nature through birds," he said. "That's why trails are an important way to reach out to them. If you can just get a small percentage of that 70 million people to your trail you're doing O.K. The people are there. They just don't call themselves birders. You just need to show them the way."
One benefit of a trail, he said, is that birders are most active in the spring and fall, when business is slower than in the busy summer season. "It can help you create a year-round market," Mr. Eubanks said.
Ms. Dickson said people can nominate sites for the trail at the Web site www.ctbirdingtrails.org. A committee will review the nominations and decide which should be on the trail.
Ms. Dickson said the trail would be in place by next summer with detailed information about each site posted on the Web site. The plan is to produce a colored map that can be given to potential visitors as well as a guidebook about the trail.
She said some sites are certain to be included because they are easily accessible and have established education programs and staff. These include the Denison Pequotsepos Nature Center, Audubon Greenwich, the Coastal Center in Milford and Hammonasset Beach State Park in Madison. Some sites may not be able to be listed because they are too fragile to handle more visitors.
There are about 400 species of birds in Connecticut and the state is a stopover for many species that travel the Atlantic Flyway, which they migrate along while flying north and south each year.
Efforts will be made to tie the bird watching in with other wildlife that visitors can see while in Connecticut, such as seals. The trail will also stress the birds' connection to the water, which has historic importance for shipping, fishing and whaling. The hope is that birders will stay longer or plan other trips to learn more about these topics.
"Birds are just part of a larger story," Mr. Eubanks said.
Birds already have a track record of attracting people in Connecticut. Andy Griswold, the director of travel programs for the Connecticut Audubon Society, said the annual Connecticut River Eagle Festival in Essex each February draws up to 8,000 people who celebrate the return of the bald eagle to the Connecticut River. There are boats trips, educational programs and demonstrations.
Mr. Griswold said that if the trail program is managed properly as to not harm sensitive areas, then it will be beneficial. "I'm hearing that is a strong concern of the people here," he said. "There is a fear of loving a resource to death."
Frank Haviland, the Connecticut trail coordinator, has come up with a long list of ways that the sites and businesses can attract bird-watchers. They include having bird-watching trips that start or end at restaurants and hotels, offering bird-watching packages, having businesses link to the trail's Web site, providing maps of birding sites and having a bulletin board to display recent sightings.
"There's no question this will be a success," Ms. Jones said. "The trick is to make the rest of the tourism industry aware of how important the trail along with nature centers and nature areas are to the tourist economy."

HEADLINE: Why Millburn Wants Out 

BYLINE:  By JEREMY PEARCE 

DATELINE: MILLBURN 

 BODY:
THIS is an odd place for a revolution.
 The streets of Millburn are lined with fur salons, fashion boutiques and ice cream parlors. They show no barricades, no guillotine or any hint of smoldering unrest. The same holds true in Millburn's swanky Short Hills section, where the traffic of commerce at the famous Short Hills Mall purrs on without pause. 
 Yet this Essex County township, known for its schools and rail connection as much as for its tranquility, is engulfed in an act of revolt so extraordinary that tremors are being felt as far away as the State House. 
"It doesn't hurt once in a while to drop a little tea into the harbor," said Salvatore J. Bate, the township's deputy mayor.
On the strength of a referendum approved last year by 88 percent of voters, Millburn is making the case for leaving Essex County and joining Morris County, which has already agreed to receive the rebels. At issue are property taxes and the $33 million in revenue that Millburn sends to Essex each year, a tax bill that it hopes to reduce by $19 million by joining Morris.
Behind the gunsmoke is the cloaked question of suburban obligations to faltering urban centers in an era of vast economic divisions. Essex, with its chronically poor Newark, needs Millburn's money.
The secession urge has gone past mere grumbling. Millburn's mayor, Thomas C. McDermott, says that taxes sent to Essex represent one-third of revenue and that a switch to Morris would result in a tax break of $2,700 to $3,000 a household. This year, after Millburn reassessed its real estate for the first time in two decades, some tax bills fell by as much as 6 percent. But the average township bill increased 11 percent, and in Old Short Hills local taxes climbed an average of 31 percent. Throughout the township, the news was not welcomed.
"We're trying to eradicate an injustice," Mayor McDermott said. "Other towns realize there are inequities. If everyone wants to leave" Essex County, "then something is wrong with the system."
Few people deny the depth of cultural bonding between Morris County and the newly minted revolutionaries next door. Millburn and Short Hills are tied to Morristown, Chatham and Madison by a shared affluence and a sleek commuter train line.
This month, the five members of Millburn's township committee, all Republicans, met with the Morris County Board of Chosen Freeholders -- whose seven members all happen to be Republicans. Both sides liked what they heard, and the Morris freeholders voted unanimously to petition the Legislature to allow the secession.
"Look at the demographics of Millburn -- per capita income, their school system, the Short Hills mall, their parks and their ratables," said John J. Murphy, Morris County's freeholder director. "It's a no-brainer."
The politics of secession, bloody at the best of times, is a different matter.
State Senator Richard J. Codey, a Democrat from Essex County, noted that any move by Millburn would require the approval of two-third majorities in the Assembly and the Senate as well as the signature of Governor McGreevey. He calls the idea unlikely. And in a period when budget shortfalls continue to threaten state aid to ailing cities, he said, such a sweep would be damaging, especially to Newark.
"This would be a vote to increase property taxes in every other town in Essex County," Senator Codey said. "Millburn needs to sit down with the county and work out their problems."
But the notion of secession has gained other adherents.
State Assemblyman Thomas H. Kean Jr., a Republican from Westfield, has offered to sponsor a secession bill and is pushing a second bill that would authorize a study of county governments. Mr. Kean said he hoped to stir a statewide review of the effectiveness of counties, given the tax burden they incur on municipalities. "The Millburn issue is really a touchstone to a much larger debate," he said.

'The Moral Argument'
Mr. Kean and Assemblyman Eric Munoz, a Republican from Summit, who both represent Millburn, said they had found a changing sensibility among constituents about county taxation and the moral obligation of wealthy suburbs to help support troubled towns and cities.
"Is there some level of taxation that's not moral any more? What's the threshold?" Mr. Munoz said. "I work in Newark, but I represent Millburn and Short Hills. I no longer find the moral argument persuasive."
Although Millburn's population of 19,800 is dwarfed by Newark's 274,000, Millburn pays a county tax bill that is second only to Newark's, which is $42 million.
Even so, the one-third proportion of Millburn's annual budget sent to the county remains in line with the rest of the state.
"We use the figure of 30 percent of municipal taxes going to the counties," said William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities. "Most local money goes to school systems and then to counties. And we haven't heard an outcry about that generally." 
Diplomacy can sometimes calm complex tax disputes, Mr. Dressel added. He said that Atlantic, Bergen, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean and Somerset counties were known for good relations between freeholders and municipal officials. Essex, Hudson, Mercer and Passaic have enjoyed less success in linking hands. 
"Bigger government often means inefficiency and duplication," he said, adding that the issue of secession had not been raised seriously in any of New Jersey's 566 municipalities since the 1930's. "If there's any friction there, you will know it."
Dr. Dennis E. Gale, a Rutgers professor of public administration and political science, said municipal secession had been a rare phenomenon nationally. Counties tend to be weak entities in New England, he said, but in Southern states they often take on responsibilities of policing and taxation. As for New Jersey, he thinks that it is in a prime position for local clashes with county governments.
"New Jersey's counties have a weird blend of responsibilities," Dr. Gale said. "We have the worst of both worlds. From a cost point of view, and moral questions aside, it may not be that county government is the best option here."
Mr. Kean has cited the case of Connecticut, which abolished most of the functions of its eight counties more than four decades ago.
Joel Cogen, executive director of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, said that corruption and patronage within the counties was the primary reason for the abolition, in 1960. County courts, jails and law enforcement staff were shifted to the state itself, even as the counties' geographical borders were left untouched.
In the decades since, regional forms of government, including sewer and water districts, planning agencies, school districts and recycling boards, have arisen to take the place of county-based administration. Nevertheless, Mr. Cogen said, Connecticut is probably not a suitable model for abolition.
"I'm not sure that our conditions are analogous to the situation in New Jersey," he said. "After all, counties had very, very limited functions and powers here. And that was a long time ago."
Mr. Bate, Millburn's deputy mayor, said local fervor for secession was probably touched off by a larger frustration over the perception that cities in Essex County have a lock on state representation in Trenton. Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, for instance, also holds office as a state senator, as does City Councilman Ronald L. Rice of Newark. Likewise, Mayor Mims Hackett Jr. of Orange and Mayor John F. McKeon of West Orange are members of the state Assembly. All four officeholders are Democrats.
"It's absurd," Mr. Bate said. "I don't think you can find that extent of dual officership in any other state."
These days, however, the talk on Millburn's streets sounds less inflamed than the speech in township committee rooms.
The cockpit of unrest remains in Old Short Hills, where the average local tax bill this year reached $21,000. Perhaps not coincidentally, Short Hills is also home to four of Millburn's five committee members.
"If secession is what it takes to cut taxes, then I have to say I'm all for it," said Pete Vrahnos, a retired firefighter who lives in Millburn. "But let's face it, it's just not realistic."
Yael Weinstein, a middle-school teacher who moved her family to Millburn for the school system, which is rated among the best in the state, said she had watched neighbors depart to Morristown and Livingston, in search of lower property taxes. "I love Millburn, but we're now paying for other places," she said. "We're not rich, and we can't watch taxes going higher and higher."

An Uprising Within
At least one resident is looking to start an uprising within Millburn's revolt.
Abbott Gorin has tried unsuccessfully in the last two elections to add his Democratic voice to a township committee dominated by Short Hills Republicans.
"We should be looking at the question of Millburn seceding from Short Hills," he said half-seriously.
In a further act of rebellion, Mr. Gorin has suggested revising Millburn's election rules to have committee members elected from distinct districts instead of at large. A result, he said, would be more representation for Millburn's Democrats. It may be an audacious proposal well-suited for a revolution, though Mr. Gorin is not particularly confident.
"It might," he said, "end all this grandstanding and not dealing with our statewide problem: the problem of how we bear the burden of dealing with failing cities and towns."

HEADLINE: Breakdown in Communications 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN WARNER 

 BODY:
LAURA and Ken Jewell have entered the Lucent afterlife.
 After more than 20 years in the telecommunications industry, the Fair Haven residents are now out on their own. Ms. Jewell, who was laid off just three months before she would have been eligible for early retirement, is running her own marketing business, promoting the Red Bank Jazz and Blues Festival and helping startup businesses. Her husband, who retired before he was even 50, is now selling his hand-carved wooden ducks and teaching banjo. 
 The Jewells are small players in the great New Jersey telecom crash that has ravaged one of the state's leading industries, leaving thousands of highly skilled workers jobless or underemployed. 
"At first it was a shock," said Ms. Jewell, who owns up to being in her 40's. "We all grew up in this company. There were so many opportunities you never really looked anywhere else. Now the situation is that the company is shrinking and there's no other place to go."
In just two years, telecommunications executives saw option packages worth tens of millions of dollars -- and their jobs -- evaporate. Some of the most prestigious companies in New Jersey were thrown into turmoil, most notably Lucent Technologies. Lucent, parent company of the state's research icon, Bell Labs, plans to slash its global workforce to 35,000 by March, from 153,000 three years ago.
AT&T and Verizon, the state's second and third-largest employers respectively, are also scaling back. AT&T, after spinning off Lucent and other businesses over the past several years, including its cable operations, let 10,000 employees go worldwide. And Verizon is also reducing staff to cope with declining business in New Jersey.
New Jersey -- which ranks among the nation's top telecom clusters along with San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, Atlanta and Washington -- is not suffering more than the others. All of them are reeling in the aftermath of a global investment binge that lead to today's industrywide hangover.
Nor are the mammoth companies the only ones suffering. The once high-flying startups that flourished in their shadows are sputtering, and makers of telecommunications equipment are scrambling to reposition products for other industries.
"It's been a catastrophe," said former Representative James Courter, president of IDT Corp. a Newark-based company that provides long-distance service and prepaid calling cards. "It is probably the largest implosion of an industry in the history of this country."
Even now, two years into the slump, the industry shows no signs of coming back.
"We were so used to growth, even hyper-growth for awhile," said Matt Desch, chief executive of Telcordia Inc. of Morristown, a software and service provider that has cut its staff to 4,869 from 8,657 in February 2001. "Now we're in a state of decline."
Mr. Desch added, "Most of us see signs it has leveled out, but we don't see any signs that there's going to be growth any time soon."
While the crash of the once-thriving telecom business is a global phenomenon, the effect on New Jersey has been particularly pronounced since it is one of the state's leading industries. From 1992 to 2000, employment grew from to 71,000 from 63,700. Since then, however, the number of employees has dropped to 66,800, according to the New Jersey Department of Labor.
"Telecom has been one of the pillars of the New Jersey economy along with pharmaceuticals and tourism," said Joseph Gonzalez, president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, a trade organization. "The downturn has had a significant effect. The difference from five years ago and today has been dramatic."

Rich History in Communications
Ever since the nation's first long-distance telephone lines were stretched across the state from New York to Philadelphia in 1885, New Jersey has had a long and prosperous involvement in the telecommunications business. In 1941, Bell Labs, the research arm of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, moved to Murray Hill from New York City, and New Jersey went on to nurture such life-altering innovations as the transistor, communication satellites and the computer language, UNIX.
In the 1970's and 1980's, the office staff of American Telephone and Telegraph also migrated from New York to new suburban office space in Bedminster. By the late 1980's, AT&T's chief executives were all based in New Jersey, although the company's official headquarters to this day remains in New York.
"New Jersey is ground zero of the telebomb," said Peter Bernstein, president of Infonautics Consulting Inc. of Ramsey, which specializes in telecommunications.
To Joseph Seneca, chairman of the New Jersey Council of Economic Advisors, the industry chaos is the result of three major factors:
*Vast overinvestment in telecommunications equipment -- particularly in fiber-optic networks, which occurred in the late 1990's -- similar to the bubble experienced by dot-com businesses that eventually lead to that industry's bust.
*Deregulation, resulting in fierce competition among local and long-distance carriers, driving down prices and profit.
*The flood of such new technology as wireless communications and computer-based telephony, putting pressure on companies using traditional landlines.
"These three factors -- combined with the general economic downturn -- have really made the industry significantly exposed," Mr. Seneca said.
Of course, the state's most widely known telecom problems have focused on Lucent, which makes telephone equipment for such service providers as AT&T and Verizon. In addition to the loss of jobs, Lucent's stock has dropped from $84 a share in 1999, when it was one of the nation's most widely held companies, to below $1 this fall.
Lucent was created in 1996 when it was spun off from AT&T into a market that was set to explode with growth -- fed by optimism about the Internet and another round of deregulation.
"There was dot-com mania and start-up frenzy going on," said William Price, a spokesman for Lucent. "There was almost unlimited capital from venture capital firms."
In the supercharged environment, Mr. Price explained, the company went from having a few hundred customers to several thousand around the world, and it was projecting growth rates of 15 to 20 percent. But by 2000 the company was in trouble.
He said the downturn began when Lucent miscalculated the design on a crucial product that transmits information and watched as buyers showed a clear preference for the same product made by its Canadian competitor, Nortel Networks. Lucent lost business on that just as the entire industry was becoming buried in a glut of unneeded equipment and high debt taken on to build it.
But when the bottom fell out at Lucent, it fell rapidly. As 2001 dawned, Lucent employed 106,000 people worldwide, but by this September that number had dropped to 47,000. And last month the company announced plans to cut back again. The bulk of Lucent's New Jersey employees work at three locations: 2,300 in Holmdel, 2,000 in Murray Hill and 2,500 in Whippany.
Trying to put the best face on a grim situation, Mr. Price noted that 55 percent of Lucent's downsizing was done through layoffs, with the rest of the staff reductions coming from the sale or spin-off of businesses and outsourcing programs -- in which workers moved with their jobs to a new owner. Voluntary incentive plans encouraged 8,500 employees to leave the company, he said, of which about 30 percent came from New Jersey; those who left with early retirement packages are earning about 30 percent their salary and are covered by Lucent's health plan, but they worry that they could lose those benefits if the company fails.
While some analysts have raised the possibility that Lucent will file for bankruptcy protection, the company emphasized in its October earnings announcement that it had enough cash to pay its bills. After completing its most recent cost cuts, Lucent said it expected to be profitable by the end of next year. "When this all clears," said Mr. Price, "Lucent will still be standing."
Cutbacks have also taken a toll on Bell Labs, the research arm of Lucent. Mr. Seneca said Bell's scientists, who were once encouraged to pursue far-out science in hopes of making breakthroughs, have been reined in.
"Bell Labs was the long-standing icon of superb research, and that has been threatened and changed in terms of focus to much more of an immediate payoff," said Mr. Seneca. "That has an effect on the company, but also on the overall research capability of New Jersey as the state where basic science and cutting-edge science is done."

AT&T Is Paring Back
In the meantime, AT&T has been paring back to become more of a pure service provider for businesses and residential customers. The latest slimming down began in 1996, when it spun off Lucent along with Avaya of Basking Ridge, which serves large business clients, and Agere, AT&T's computer equipment business, now based in Bethlehem, Pa.
Last year AT&T Wireless, with headquarters in Redmond, Wash., split off from AT&T, and last week AT&T Broadband, a cable television company that also provides Internet service, merged with Comcast.
In addition, AT&T has let 10,000 employees go in the past two years, bringing its global workforce to 72,000. Of those 72,000 employees, 16,000 work at 108 sites in New Jersey, including 3,500 at AT&T's corporate headquarters and its global network operations center in Bedminster. The center is the size of a football field and transmits 310 million voice calls a day and data equal to the Library of Congress every 11.5 minutes.
But AT&T, like Verizon, its local service rival, is losing ground to new competitors and technology including wireless and the Internet. In the third quarter, AT&T said its residential business was down $2.8 billion, or 25.9 percent.
Verizon, which has its headquarters in New York, is the descendent of New Jersey Bell and several other regional operators spun off from AT&T in the original 1984 divestiture. The company, along with others, has been moving steadily into its former parent's long-distance businesss. In New Jersey, Verizon has 6.8 million lines, and employs 18,720, including staff at its wireless joint venture with Britain's Vodaphone in Bedminster.
But Verizon is also losing basic business.
"The traditional landline telephone business is in pretty rapid decline in New Jersey," said Dennis Bone, president of Verizon New Jersey. He said the company had lost 350,000 lines in the state since January 2001 as a result of customers switching to wireless or getting rid of their second line when they switched to cable Internet service.
"As a result, we need to manage our business down to a smaller company," said Mr. Bone. He said capital spending in New Jersey will drop to $800 million this year, 40 percent below its 2000 peak. The company has already cut more than 300 jobs in New Jersey by offering early-retirement incentives and is seeking 900 more volunteers.
In addition to wireless and computers, Verizon is also facing new competition in local service in several states, including New Jersey, where regulators have reduced the prices Verizon can charge competitors to use its local lines. Mr. Bone said the rates were now below cost and would put Verizon at a disadvantage. "In the long run this model will simply not work," he said.
Jeff Roberts, a spokesman at AT&T, said local competition had exploded in New Jersey as well as other states, which have ordered a reduction in the wholesale rates that local carriers can charge competitors for access to that crucial last mile. AT&T and other carriers are aggressively marketing in Verizon's territory.
Mr. Roberts objected to Verizon's argument that the new model in New Jersey and elsewhere required the company to subsidize competitors. "It is disingenuous for Verizon to claim that reselling others' networks is not sound," he said, "since that's exactly how Verizon got into the long distance business."
Beyond the industry's big names, the telecommunications bust has also hit thousands of other companies in the state that feed off the industry.
Fred Barre, chairman of The Barre Company in Mountainside, a 51-year-old family-owned operation that makes metal parts for the telecom industry, said business was off 70 percent from two years ago.
In July and August 2000, Mr. Barre said his company shipped more than $300,000 in inventory to Ericsson, the Swedish mobile telephone company. In September, he added, orders had dropped to $10,000.
"It didn't slow down," said Mr. Barre. "It just stopped."
To make matters worse, the company expanded during the boom, opening a new plant in Virginia that Mr. Barre has since had to close, putting all 45 employees out of work. In Mountainside, he has cut the number of employees to 45 from 100.
Sales are down to $6 million a year, half what they were in 2000, he said, but about the same as in 1995.
"This is certainly the longest and the deepest recession we've seen," said Mr. Barre. "People have talked about whether this is really a recession or a slowdown, but from a manufacturer's standpoint it's really been a recession-depression since 2000, and it is certainly exacerbated by telecom or what used to be telecom."
But it is more than a story about sagging profit margins numbers.
Ms. Jewell, the former Lucent employee from Fair Lawn, organizes regular meetings of Lucent refugees and now has an e-mail list approaching 700. She said she has seen waves of laid-off workers pass through distinct stages of shock, disbelief and anger that usually, within a few months, mellow into contemplation as the workers try to figure out what to do next.
Many former Lucent executives have begun teaching or are starting their own small businesses, said Ms, Jewell. Some are relying on a spouse's paycheck, or have gone to work part-time. She said many Lucent engineers had tried their hand at Home Depot, including her husband, who worked there for six months.
"Others are trying to act as consultants in what remains of the telecom industry," said Ms. Jewell, "or they're going to the technology piece in other types of companies like pharmaceuticals."
Despite the jump in unemployment Ms. Jewell said that so far there had not been a large migration out of New Jersey.
"That's because there's nowhere for them to go," said Donald Peterson, chief executive of Avaya, the AT&T spinoff that reduced its global workforce by 2,500 jobs -- to 19,500 -- this year.
Mr. Peterson said he did not expect a recovery in the industry until it leapfrogged over the current equipment glut with new breakthrough technology that customers demand. The development cycle, he noted, usually takes three to five years.
In that time, he said, New Jersey -- with its marquee-name telecom companies -- might be better poised to recruit the most talented young people who several years ago were lured to dot-com startups. But by then, time might have passed by many of those currently jobless who are in their 40's and 50's.
"How will these guys stay fresh?" he asked. "To stay in it, you need to be current and that's not easy to do with just a personal computer."

Trillions of Dollars in Debt
As Mr. Bernstein of Infonautics put it, there can be no recovery until the industry has shed several trillion dollars of debt.
"The good news is that the inevitable trends are working in favor of the people who survive," he said.
The world is becoming increasingly "network-centric," said Mr. Bernstein, with huge developing countries like India and China demanding more telecom equipment and services. As demand recovers, New Jersey is likely to again take a leading role. The hemorrhaging at the state's large telecom employers has given birth to a wealth of small startup working in new areas of technology. Not all of them will survive, said Mr. Bernstein, but those that do will be ready to grow.
Mr. Bernstein pointed to IDT as an up-and-coming company that was experimenting with voice service over computers. Founded in Hackensack as an international phone service provider, IDT now employs 1,500 in the former Mutual Benefit Life building in Newark.
IDT and others that can survive the current climate, said Mr. Bernstein, are likely to grow through the misfortune of others. Mr. Courter said IDT recently bought Winstar, a Virginia wireless provider for commercial buildings, for $45 million. Three years ago the company was worth $7 billion.
Mr. Bernstein also said New Jersey was a leader in nanotechnology, which will also be in the leading edge of the coming generations of telecom. He said several companies, including a division of IDT, are working on bringing voice service to residential personal computers. And, he said, the United States lagged the rest of the world in broadband. When it begins to catch up, New Jersey companies will capture a significant share of that market too.
Owen Kurtin, a telecommunications specialist at the Salans law firm in New York, said research was crucial to any recovery.
"We are in a period where research and development is suffering," Mr. Kurtin said. "I don't think it will dry up completely and the good news for New Jersey is that it has sufficient critical mass in telecom and intellectual capital between AT&T and Lucent that New Jersey is not going to lose its relative market segment in telecom."
He added, "Eventually, companies are going to have to start spending on equipment again if for no other reason than the old equipment will wear out."
But by then, many workers may have given up any hope of working in their once-thriving industry -- at least in New Jersey.
"We were all living nicely and we were enjoying the benefits, but there was a cost as well," said Ms. Jewell. "We were all working incredible hours and maybe we weren't doing the exact thing we wanted to do. This has been the opportunity to go out and spread our wings. One door closed, another opened."

VIRTUALLY everywhere, from tiny towns to the world's biggest economies, a balanced budget is like a Good Housekeeping seal of political approval. And yet governments just can't seem to stick to the rules they set for themselves. Should they even bother trying?
 The idea of a balanced budget certainly seems sensible. What goes in, goes out. No borrowing, and not too much hoarding of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars, either. 
 Every state in the union except Indiana and Vermont has a law or constitution requiring a balanced budget. The European Union decided in 1997 that countries using the euro currency would not be able to run a deficit of more than 3 percent without facing stiff fines and penalties. For decades, the International Monetary Fund has made balanced or near-balanced budgets a condition of aid to some developing countries.
In practice, though, balanced-budget rules don't always work. At least 40 states' budgets for 2003 will have to cover shortfalls from 2002, and the situation may worsen next year. Germany is likely to flout the European Union's budget rules this year, and France is dangerously close, with a shortfall of 2.8 percent this year that is expected to grow in 2003. After the spending limits of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 expired this year, Washington led the nation back to the land of 12-figure deficits.
The recent downturn in the global economy is responsible for most budgetary problems. Incomes for individuals and companies stopped growing or shrank, and so did tax revenue. At the same time, more people became eligible for publicly funded income support, jobless benefits, health insurance and the like. The governments had not planned enough for leaner times and found themselves in the red.
As a result of the balanced-budget rules, many states and countries have to cut spending and raise taxes at the worst possible time -- pursuing policies that stifle economic growth when it is most needed. This conundrum is well-known elsewhere in the world; critics of the International Monetary Fund castigated its economists for insisting that Southeast Asia's crisis-ridden nations install austere fiscal policies in the late 1990's, slowing that region's economic recovery.
So do balanced-budget rules make sense? They can, if governments behave responsibly. Yet few do. At the extreme is Argentina. Its economy grew by 22 percent, adjusted for inflation, from 1993 to 1998. Despite strong early increases in tax revenue, its federal government ran a deficit in every single year, rather than surpluses that could have paid off debt or cushioned the budget in the future. When the economy turned south, the country could not borrow enough to make ends meet and collapsed.
Despite much better economic fundamentals in the United States, many of the 50 states made the same kinds of mistakes. The nation's overall economy grew 32 percent from 1993 to 2000. States used higher tax revenue to pay for more services, new construction projects and higher salaries for government workers. Few put enough money aside for the inevitable downturn in the economic cycle.
WHY didn't the states and countries save more when times were good? One reason is overoptimism. During the last boom, some forecasters wondered openly whether there would ever be another recession. And surpluses always seem to burn holes in politicians' pockets. They'd rather win points with voters by returning the money through lower taxes or by spending it on popular programs.
But hold on. Plenty of economists say Washington's quick switch to deficits was a good thing. During weak economic times, they argue, worsening fiscal balances can be a side effect of policies that lessen hardship, like tax cuts and extensions of unemployment benefits. Unlike the federal government, though, the states do not have the leeway to put such policies into effect.
This year, at least 37 states have scaled back spending, resulting in more than $15 billion in lost funds for education, welfare benefits, health insurance, public safety, public works -- you name it. A similar series of events promises to occur on a much larger scale in Europe. In New York City, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has to make billions in cuts to avoid a state takeover of the city's finances.
So should the states and the European Union abandon their balanced-budget rules, and should we stop worrying about the federal deficit at home? Not necessarily. Staying close to fiscal balance over long periods of time keeps interest rates low, for both public and private borrowers. But if governments could commit to that long-term strategy, a little more room to maneuver in the short term probably wouldn't hurt.

War: What (Stocks) Is It Good For?

BYLINE:  By DONNA ROSATO 

 BODY:
IN recent months, the possibility of war with Iraq has often cast a pall over the stock market. 
 But if history is a guide, many fund managers and market strategists say, there is a good chance that the market will rally if hostilities begin -- and if the United States prevails quickly. As a result, the first signs of conflict could be a buying opportunity. 
 "Those investors that are willing to go ahead and assume the risk that the conflict will be resolved satisfactorily will in all likelihood benefit from increasing their exposure to stocks," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service. "But this calls for some investment fortitude. You're going against the market." 
Even strategists who advocate that investors plan for war generally advise against short-term investments in military contractors and oil companies. While these areas may yield strong long-term returns, strategists and fund managers say that sectors like technology, transportation and some consumer staples are more likely to thrive in the short run.
There is broad agreement, however, that heightened geopolitical uncertainty will make it difficult for the market to sustain a broad upward move for long. "The market will be very hard pressed to rally leading up to a war," said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief investment strategist for PNC Advisors, the wealth management division of PNC Financial Services, which is based in Pittsburgh. 
Ample precedent is found for a strong rally once a war begins, Mr. Kleintop said. He noted that share prices declined in the weeks leading up to World War II, the Cuban missile crisis and the Persian Gulf war. The market rebounded once wars began, or, in the case of the missile crisis, the dispute ended peacefully.
In the months leading up to the gulf war, for example, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped more than 12 percent, to a low of 295.46 in October 1990. By the time the United States began its military campaign in January 1991, the index had climbed to 327.97; it would rise 28 percent over the next 12 months.
A prolonged or unresolved conflict could weigh on stocks. When the United States invaded Afghanistan last fall, for example, stocks did not stage a sustained war-related rally. 
Military contractors are not likely to benefit much from a short war because such a conflict would not increase their revenue substantially, said Jon B. Kutler, chairman and chief executive of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, an investment bank based in Los Angeles that focuses on military and aerospace companies. Still, he said, there is no doubt that military spending is on the uptick under President Bush.
While Mr. Kutler views the sector as a poor investment for the short term, he says it will perform well over a longer horizon. "Wall Street tends to fall in and out of love with this sector, but I expect defense companies to post record profits these next few years," he said
Similarly, Matthew Fruhan, manager of the $305 million Fidelity Select Defense and Aerospace Portfolio, said, "It's clear that we're in the middle of a defense spending upcycle that began in the late 1990's." His fund's top five holdings include Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and Boeing, as well as the communications equipment makers L-3 Communications and Harris.
Andrew Pratt, who manages more than $200 million in the Montgomery U.S. Focus and Montgomery Growth funds, holds shares of Raytheon, which makes computer-guided weapons and surveillance equipment, and General Dynamics, a maker of military vehicles and advanced communications systems. "These are relatively inexpensive defense companies that I think will be beneficiaries of increased defense spending going forward," Mr. Pratt said.
Despite the creation of a Department of Homeland Security and worries about bioterrorism, Mr. Pratt is cool to stocks of biodefense and airport security companies. Many of these companies have yet to make a profit, he said. 
The threat of war has contributed to the volatility of oil prices, which have fluctuated from about $24 to $30 a barrel since September. Investors with a strong stomach for risk could try to capitalize on a downward price movement by short-selling energy stocks. These might include BP, Exxon Mobil and ChevronTexaco. Analysts say that if it becomes clear the United States will attack Iraq, oil prices are likely to spike up. But if Iraq's vast oil reserves were opened to world markets, oil prices could plummet, and oil stocks would be expected to fall for the short term. 
"Iraq has the second-largest known oil reserves in the world," said Philip J. Flynn, a senior market analyst at Alaron Trading, a brokerage firm in Chicago. "If you get a regime change and a friendlier government, the spigots will be opened and it'll be a lot harder for OPEC to control prices." 
Still, short-selling -- betting on a decline in stock prices -- is always risky. If a stock rises, the losses can be greater than the original investment.
A more conservative move might be to invest for the long term in oil and equipment companies that could benefit if Iraqi oil fields reopened. "This is an area that could benefit both from a war and the economic recovery," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P., which projects that the economy will grow 2.4 percent this year and 3 percent in 2003. While diversified oil companies like BP, Exxon Mobil and ChevronTexaco are likely to benefit over the long haul, Mr. Stovall says S.& P. also recommends smaller companies that concentrate on drilling, like EOG Resources, Nabors Industries and Evergreen Resources. 
BUT conservative investors may simply want to fortify their portfolios against the disruptive effects of tensions between the United States and Iraq, or against the possibility that United States war plans go awry. One way to do that is to reduce stock holdings and invest in Treasury bonds or cash. Investors could also increase their holdings in companies that produce consumer staples like food, beverages and household products. "During a period of market uncertainty, these stocks would fall less than the overall market because demand for these goods is relatively static," Mr. Stovall said. 
Within this sector, Mr. Stovall recommends household names like Alberto-Culver, which makes hair care and food products, PepsiCo and Sysco, a food distributor.
Some bullish investors say a short conflict won by the United States would spur consumer confidence and unleash pent-up business spending, leading to a broad rally. Mr. Stovall of S.& P. said technology and transportation companies would be main beneficiaries, including the semiconductor makers Microchip Technologies and Analog Devices, software companies like Microsoft and Symantec as well as the Union Pacific railroad and the Yellow Corporation, a trucking company. 
"The concern about war has been a huge negative for the economy and business decision makers," said Dr. Sherry Cooper, global economic strategist at the Bank of Montreal Financial Group. "Capital spending is hanging in the balance. If there's a short, quick end to the war, that will have a very positive effect on the economy and the stock market."

But they say consumer staples, a steady sector, may be a safer investment. Some oil-service stocks may do well if oil fields need upgrades or reconstruction.

In a Quest for Travel Deals, to the Flexible Go the Spoils

BYLINE:  By HARRIET EDLESON 

 BODY:
IF you're planning a vacation around the holidays or beyond, you may be in luck: prices, especially for overseas travel, are among the lowest in years. But to get the best deals you will need to be flexible and act fast -- and perhaps even be willing to leave at the last minute.
 "The prices this year are about where they were in 1997," said Michael Greenwald, co-owner of Personalized Travel, a travel agency in Washington. 
 Last week, the Air Transport Association, an industry trade group, reported that average domestic fares in October were about 18 percent cheaper than they were two years ago, while international fares were about 9 percent lower. (The group said it was more appropriate to make comparisons to 2000 because passenger traffic plunged in late 2001 after the terrorist attacks.) 
Many airlines have been offering special holiday deals. American Airlines, for example, has reduced fares within the United States through Jan. 6. A round-trip coach ticket from New York to Miami, for instance, costs as little as $198 on its Web site.
Travel experts urge consumers to act soon on their plans, or some deals may be sold out. Availability could be especially tight this year because some airlines have cut back on their number of flights.
Some of the better deals may be found in packages that include the costs of round-trip airfare, accommodations and sometimes even breakfast. Travel experts say that buying a package will not only save money and time, but will also guarantee that the flights will be available for the time you want to spend at a hotel or resort. New packages keep popping up almost hourly.
"If you know where to look, you can find a deal to just about anyplace," said Ilene Braun, vice president for marketing and sales at Gate1Travel (www.gate1travel.com), a tour operator based in Glenside, Pa. "We ask our carrier partners to give us the dates they're not going to sell, then we go to our hotels abroad." 
Overseas packages are especially attractive right now, according to James V. Cammisa Jr., editor of an independent newsletter called Travel Industry Indicators. He said international travel had been lagging as more people were traveling closer to home, largely because of the weak economy, threats of terrorism and the possibility of war with Iraq. As a result, many travel companies have had to reduce prices to stir interest. A higher number of unsold seats and rooms have been sold to travel agents, tour operators and Web sites, which offer them to consumers at discounts of 50 percent or more.
Hal Simmons, 65, of Washington, a retired federal inspector with the Labor Department, recently booked a last-minute Holland America cruise to Mexico for this week. He said he had not intended to travel for Thanksgiving but that he could not resist the price: $1,002 for seven days from San Diego to Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta and Cabo San Lucas, less than half the original price of $2,309.
Mr. Simmons booked the trip through a travel agent a day after finding out about it while doing some research for a future cruise to Alaska. "I was just ready to go," he said, adding that he would use discount coupons from United Airlines to fly to and from San Diego.
There are plenty of other bargains for those looking to escape to warm climates. Starting at $399, travelers can spent three nights at the Crowne Plaza Hotel on Grand Bahama Island, including round-trip airfare from New York. The trip is available Jan. 2 to March 31 through Delta Air Lines (www.deltavacations.com).
The following are some other overseas package deals. Prices are per person, based on double occupancy; surcharges and taxes may be extra.

MONTREAL -- (www.site59.com) Three nights at a Holiday Inn and round-trip coach fare on US Airways, starting at $271, from New York. (Prices vary from other cities.) Travelers depart on Dec. 5 and return on Dec. 8.

PRAGUE -- (www.continentaljourneys.com) Five nights at the Hotel Sofia, a three-star hotel, including breakfast, with round-trip airfare on Scandinavian Airlines from Newark and airport transfers for $499, now through March 31.

LONDON -- (www.travelzoo.com) Four nights at the Craven Gardens Hotel, with breakfast, and round-trip airfare from New York on United Airlines, for $369 until March 28.

PARIS -- (gate1travel.com) Three nights at the three-star Mondial Hotel and round-trip airfare from New York for $389.

Swanky Boutiques Strut North on Madison Avenue

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ

 BODY:
Rising rents have remade the face of Madison Avenue. As high-end international boutiques have come to dominate Madison between 57th and 72nd Streets, luxury retailing has begun to migrate north, creating a vibrant local shopping district that extends into the 80's.
 Madison Avenue has had the fastest-rising retail rents in the United States, according to a study released two weeks ago by Cushman & Wakefield, a brokerage and real estate services company. In the year ending in June, the average annual rent along Madison from 57th to 63rd Street increased 25 percent, to $650 per square foot. Asking rents on Madison have remained strong through this fall, according to an even newer survey released Wednesday by the Real Estate Board of New York. 
 Those numbers have reverberated along the avenue as retailers have crept north in search of more affordable space. In the last three years, luxury shops like Carolina Herrera, Michael Kors, Borghese and VBH, which opened two weeks ago, have popped up north of 72nd Street, and a vibrant, local, increasingly upscale shopping district has blossomed as far north as 86th Street. Coach opened last year on Madison at 85th Street, and next fall Dean & DeLuca is scheduled to replace the Gristede's at 85th Street.
"Seventy-Second used to be the Mason-Dixon line," said Christopher Moore, a partner in Artbag Creations, a boutique that moved from Madison Avenue and 64th Street after 41 years to make room for two new Chanel boutiques that opened last spring. "The new Mason-Dixon, it appears, will be 86th Street."
Artbag is now on Madison at 84th Street. Peress Lingerie, a family-run store, which, after 46 years, was also displaced by Chanel, moved to Madison near 78th Street.
"The landlord kicked us out," said Herbert Peress, the owner. "We tried to convince them that mom-and-pop shops that have been loyal to them through thick and thin, through recessions and depressions, should not be summarily dismissed."
Steve Colavito, president of William Colavito, the managing agents for the Chanel space, said: "We had a number of small tenants for a number of years. We felt this was an opportunity we couldn't pass up." Chanel pays $700 a square foot, roughly double what the previous tenants paid. 
"It is becoming more difficult for the luxury independents who want to make a profit in their business to afford to be on Madison," said Gene Spiegelman, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield. "The large-brand conglomerates are responsible for driving up the prices."
Some local shops are happy to cede lower Madison to the likes of Gucci and Chanel. While shopping all along the avenue is driven largely by local consumers, the 70's and 80's have a real neighborhood feel. "It is more residential," said Susan Penzer, president of Susan Penzner Real Estate, who lives in the East 70's. "It's not just destination shopping above 72nd Street."
Even Mr. Moore of Artbag sees a silver lining. "Down there it's more hoity-toity," he said. "Up here, people will actually crack a smile." ERIKA KINETZ

HEADLINE: BOOK VALUE; 
A Wall Street Woman Who Cleared a Path

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

 BODY:
MURIEL SIEBERT'S new book, "Changing the Rules: Adventures of a Wall Street Maverick" (Free Press, $25), can be read in multiple ways. On one level, it is the story of how a young woman from Cleveland drove to New York in 1954 in a Studebaker and, in 1967, at the age of 35, became the first woman to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. Throughout her life, she took risks that other women wouldn't and overcame barriers that other women couldn't.
 But it's also possible to read the book just for the adventure and the humor. Ms. Siebert and her co-author, Aimee Lee Ball, have come up with some wickedly funny lines. When Ms. Siebert joined the stock exchange, all of the other 1,365 members were men, and there was a great deal of speculation about where Ms. Siebert would go to the bathroom because there were no women's restrooms on the exchange floor. "Not since I was a baby had so many people been so interested in my bathroom habits," she writes. When she became New York State's superintendent of banking in 1977, she was amused by the initials of her title and concluded that yes, "a woman can be a S.O.B." 
 Not being a woman, and having what my wife calls a limited sense of humor, I thought the most valuable contribution of Ms. Siebert's book was its chronicling of the upheavals of Wall Street and the banking industry over the last 50 years -- and hinting at what might have gone wrong of late.
Seen through this prism, the book's essential point is that technology, globalization and regulatory changes have altered the way American financial markets operate. Yet the regulatory agencies that monitor the system have not been modernized or restructured to keep pace, and their policies have lagged behind reality as well.
Ms. Siebert writes about how a vestige of Depression-era reforms, the walls dividing the banking, securities and insurance industries, began to crumble in the mid-1980's. "The lines of demarcation among financial institutions were blurring beyond recognition, and a whole new set of rules was required," she writes. "We needed regulation by function, not by institution; what we had was regulation by legal loophole."
The arrival of major foreign banks also changed the game, yet American regulatory policy has not been modernized to reflect that. In describing how, as banking superintendent, she resisted the takeover of Marine Midland Bank by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (the takeover eventually succeeded in 1992), Ms. Siebert argues that the mishmash of state and federal banking authorities made it easy for global financial institutions to subvert the intent of American law. 
Ms. Siebert has lived through some remarkable technological changes. When she started her own securities firm in 1967, she and her co-workers took orders by telephone and then called a clearinghouse to execute the trades. Many of the back-office functions at the Big Board were devoted to the clerical details of who traded what at what price. Before the advent of cellphones or the Internet, Ms. Siebert had WATS lines to her office, a relatively ancient acronym that stands for Wide Area Telephone Service. Records had to be kept on microfiche, which many people younger than 25 have never seen. And Ms. Siebert commonly sent "carbons" of letters, a technique that troglodytes used before the age of the copying machine.
She has also seen some deregulatory and market shocks, including the end of the ban on interstate banking, a change that led to a frenzy of bank mergers. She witnessed the "big bang" in 1975, which ended fixed commissions for brokers, and she took advantage of that change to create the first discount brokerage firm, Muriel Siebert & Company. She did that long before anyone had heard of Charles Schwab.
Large-scale computerization, of course, has completely changed the financial industry. Individual investors can now trade stocks directly from their personal computers without help from a broker, for better or for worse. Bank customers can travel anywhere and get cash from their accounts with A.T.M. cards. Institutions use new technology to trade large blocks of options, futures and more exotic financial products known as derivatives.
In her book, Ms. Siebert recalls how she was an early proponent of regulatory changes that would more effectively monitor the financial services industry. She says, for example, that she proposed back in the early 1980's that the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency be consolidated. Similarly, she argued back then that the government should combine the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. (The F.S.L.I.C. was replaced in 1989 by the Resolution Trust Corporation and in 1995 its deposit insurance functions were transferred to the F.D.I.C.) If the differences have disappeared among the regulated institutions, she contends, why does the country need different regulators?
Ms. Siebert's recollections illustrate how Wall Street has never exactly been a place that attracts saints. She started her career as an analyst, yet there were pressures on her even in the 1950's to help her firm get business on the basis of her insight and connections. Accusations that Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Citigroup, may have helped the children of his onetime star telecommunications analyst, Jack B. Grubman, get into an elite Manhattan preschool in exchange for Mr. Grubman's recommendation of AT&T shares would hardly represent anything new to Ms. Siebert.
"Some of my best recommendations were based on what the S.E.C. now calls the 'knowing possession' of material nonpublic information," Ms. Siebert acknowledges.
Ms. Siebert has also witnessed waves of enchantment and disenchantment with the markets. Many investors were burned by speculative hot stocks in the 1960's, and six million individual investors fled the stock market in the early 1970's because of a string of economic collapses on Wall Street.
Surprise, surprise: auditors haven't always been on the straight and narrow path. Ms. Siebert tells how the Rudd-Melikian Corporation of Philadelphia went public in the 1960's and lied about the collateral on its balance sheet. "When the auditing firm of Coopers & Lybrand certified the financial statements, it should have checked if the company's i.o.u.'s were backed by the collateral described, but it hadn't," Ms. Siebert writes. This was never a scandal on the same scale as Arthur Andersen's role in the collapse of Enron, but it certainly showed that accounting firms did not start failing in their auditing functions only recently.
Then came much larger flaps centered on Ivan F. Boesky and Michael R. Milken in the mid-1980's. Mr. Boesky, a stock speculator, improperly used inside information to profit from mergers and takeovers. Mr. Milken was the so-called junk-bond king who worked at Drexel Burnham Lambert. Like Mr. Boesky, he got caught manipulating the markets. 
During that period, Ms. Siebert testified in Congress that junk bonds should be labeled as "hazardous to your financial health." Drexel's chief executive, Fred Joseph, sent her a letter telling her she didn't know what she was talking about. "Well," Ms. Siebert writes in her book, "Drexel's not around anymore, and neither is Joseph." (Drexel was dismantled after filing for bankruptcy protection in 1990; last month Mr. Joseph became co-head of investment banking at Morgan Joseph, a Wall Street firm serving middle-market companies.) Ms. Siebert's book is not perfect, to be sure. Some passages are so dense that they require rereading to grasp the point. Others, like the one describing her failed bid for the Republican nomination for United States senator from New York, are probably not worth the space Ms. Siebert devotes to them.
BUT her candor and self-deprecating humor will persuade most readers to forgive these transgressions. For example, she writes: "There are people who will run screaming from the room at the mention of my name, but I sleep well at night, knowing that I've been competitive but honest, tenacious but scrupulous, tough but fair. And I guess I've enjoyed my toughness."
As to what ought to be done to repair today's financial markets, Ms. Siebert offers a series of relatively modest steps. They include requiring greater transparency of off-balance-sheet items -- the hidden risks that sank Enron. She wants more disclosure of analysts' investment banking relationships and of the activities of corporate insiders.
"Our capital-raising system became too enthusiastic and needs fine-tuning now, but it is unique and is the envy of the world," Ms. Siebert writes. "If the changes we need are implemented, we'll be able to look back 10 years from now and view today's financial events merely as an unfortunate episode in history." Millions of investors hope she's right.

HEADLINE: Walker in the Wireless City 

BYLINE:  By TOM VANDERBILT; Tom Vanderbilt is author of "Survival City: Adventures Among the Ruins of Atomic America."

 BODY:
IT is a late autumn day in Bryant Park. Red and yellow leaves swirl around clusters of green folding chairs. People sit in the thin afternoon light, talking on cellphones, to others, to themselves. The scent of a piquant cigar mixes with the crisp tang of fall.
 As I sit in this verdantly genteel place, a whole other flurry of movement and social interaction is going on around me, one invisible to the eye. I watch it on my laptop, the modern equivalent of Jimmy Stewart in a wheelchair, binoculars in hand, in "Rear Window." In the small browser window of my iBook's Airport card, an antenna of sorts, I find myself at the nexus of any number of the wireless networks that have come to blanket the city. 
 There is one called "theorywireless1," another that says "Wlan," another labeled "www.nycwireless.net" and one called simply "X." I select the penultimate choice and within seconds have a free broadband connection to the Internet, something, it is estimated, found in less than 10 percent of American homes.
While most people were not watching, New York has become host to yet another layer of infrastructure, a random, interlinking constellation of what are called "wireless access points." A survey last summer found more than 12,000 access points bristling throughout Manhattan alone, many open to anyone with a wireless card, many others closed and private, and still others available for a fee.
None of these were laid down by city workers. No streets were torn up. No laws were passed. Rather, this network has been made possible by the proliferation of ever more affordable wireless routers and networking devices, which in turn transmit the low-range, unlicensed spectrum (a wild frontier, home also to baby monitors and cordless phones) known as 802.11b, or, more genially, Wi-Fi. 
Walking the streets of New York today means walking amid an unseen tangle of Wi-Fi. The hum of Internet traffic mingles with the jostle of pedestrians. Data "packets" whiz by like bike messengers. In no place are the emerging social and urban aspects of this fact made clearer than Bryant Park, which last spring became what its operations director, Jerome Barth, calls "the first park to have installed a dedicated system that provides coverage throughout its entire footprint."
Not that you would notice. A thin antenna rising from the park's office serves as access point, while two similar antennas, on top of the bathrooms and the pizzeria near the Avenue of the Americas, function as what are called repeaters. These minor appurtenances drape the eight-acre park in high-speed Internet access.
The people who run the park now report that daily users of its high-speed access number in the high two figures. Come spring, they expect the daily figure to swell to several hundred. Internet sessions often last more than an hour. 
"We are intent on loading the park with users and increasing what we call their 'dwell time,' or how long they stay in the park," said Daniel A. Biederman, president of the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation.
The idea of Internet access surfaced at one of the corporation's regular meetings more than a year ago, Mr. Biederman recalled: "What can we do to make people stay in the park? Why do they have to go back to their offices at 2? They have to go back to get on the Web. Why don't we give them the Web?"
The idea of fixed connections seemed discordant with the park's philosophy. "They were in portions of the park that didn't seem amenable enough, too noisy," Mr. Biederman said. "We wanted to have the same thing as we have with our seating: a random distribution of the function."
Enter NYC Wireless, an ad hoc group committed to the creation of free wireless access in public spaces throughout the city. Bryant Park would be the perfect showcase for their vision.
With some clever engineering and hardware from Cisco Systems and Intel, the wireless park was born. Just as park users could sit wherever they liked, so too could they gain access where they liked. The eight-megabytes-per-second connection was as free as the sunshine and the green grass.
"When we first started the group, we were concerned about the proliferation of paid hot spots in coffee shops, hotels and airports," said Anthony Townsend, a co-founder of NYC Wireless, using the popular term for a wireless access point. "We realized that if we could deploy a free hot spot at a given location, there would be no incentive for a commercial provider to ever set up a network there. People are always going to choose the lowest-cost option."
The group began small. The other co-founder, Terry Schmidt, set up a free network in the New World coffee shop downstairs from his Upper West Side apartment. But with Bryant Park as its flagship effort, and Madison Square and Tompkins Square Parks among its other areas of coverage, the group is building a loose network of free Wi-Fi throughout the city. Apart from its centralized efforts, the group's Web site is filled with announcements from those who have set up their own access points, a do-it-yourself response to the paid Wi-Fi found at Starbucks.
Rather than a paid telecommunications service, its founders regard wireless as an urban amenity with untold implications for a city's vibrancy. "Cities wouldn't work if we didn't have networks," Mr. Townsend said, "for moving people, goods, information."
"This technology flies in the face of all the 'death of distance' and 'end of geography' rhetoric of the 90's fiber optic boom," added Mr. Townsend, a doctoral student in urban planning at M.I.T. and a researcher at the Taub Urban Research Center of New York University. For regulatory reasons, the ranges of Wi-Fi transmitters tend to be within several hundred feet.
"It's a very intimate technology, very local," he said. And perfect for New York: the denser the city, the greater the number of people who can gain access to a network. "It's easier to achieve a critical mass. When we got to 50 hot spots, that looked like a lot more than Los Angeles or Atlanta. You could actually walk between them."
Rather than the death of place, it serves to reinforce place. "Places that have it will become special," he said. This in effect causes a kind of reimagining of the city's geography -- i.e., where can I go to find a hot spot? -- although interestingly, places with access already tend to be vital urban places. 
BRYANT Park is an example of what the geographer Kevin Lynch, in his classic 1960 book "The Image of the City," called a node. Nodes, as he defined them, "may be primary junctions, places of a break in transportation, a crossing or convergence of paths, moments of shift from one structure to another." They help give "legibility" to the city, help us to orient ourselves. Node is also a word synonymous with hot spot -- a junction of Wi-Fi signals -- and the electronic nodes are turning up in the same parks, airports and public gathering places that Mr. Lynch considered physical nodes.
For Mr. Townsend, there is much possibility, and still much to be learned, in the relationship between the physical Bryant Park and its virtual twin. For example, should there be some physical manifestation of the Internet activity in the park, like a light that grows brighter with more users? Should information about park events, dining options and other local information be posted on the Bryant Park portal? 
Conversely, should the virtual park reflect the real one? "When the park closes, do we close the network down?" he asked.
Plans are in the works for a Bryant Park chat system, where users could meet online. This location-based service, as with other virtual meet-and-greet applications, represents a striking effort to overcome the social distancing augured by wireless itself: Why talk to the person next to you when you've got the world at your fingertips? 
For Mr. Biederman, the wireless program is part of the evolving mission of Bryant Park, one of the world's most heavily trafficked (900 people per acre) and intensely managed public spaces. The park has kept track of its Internet users with the same vigor with which it sends two employees with clickers (one for men, one for women; a close male-female ratio is vital to its vision of a vibrant public place) to measure park attendance each day at the peak hour of 1:15 p.m. On daily walkthroughs, the park managers approach laptop users. 
"We look over their shoulders a lot," Mr. Biederman said. "When I see someone using a laptop and I run up to them and say, 'Hi, I'm the guy who runs the park, and I wanted to see what your reaction is to this,' it's almost like parental guidance."
That raises the issue of what is on people's screens at the park. 
"We want to give users the greatest privacy possible in the usage of the system," Mr. Barth said. "We believe that just as Bryant Park is a very lawful place where people are extremely civilized, this will link in a manner to their Internet usage; that you won't feel comfortable surfing the Internet for reprehensible Web sites or pornography, because the social pressure around you will make it an unpleasant experience."
Call it "eyes on the net," an updated version of William H. Whyte's classic idea of "eyes on the street," espoused in books like "The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces" (1980). Whyte, whose time-lapse studies of pedestrian behavior and treatises on the desirability of movable chairs are the foundation stones of Bryant Park's revival, died in 1999, before the advent of the wireless park. And yet New York's emerging wireless citizens, like the cellphone users before them, would certainly have been germane to his studies of street-corner conversations, plaza footpaths and spatial relations. 
Even if the Blackberry-armed New Yorker can check e-mail anywhere, Whyte might have noted that this behavior had its own distinct patterns, that people would feel more comfortable doing so in inviting public places like Bryant Park.
Whether or not Whyte would have envisioned the wireless park, Mr. Biederman thinks it is true to his thinking. "Anything that got people into parks, made them more pleasant -- he would have thought this was terrific," he said.
DOWN the street from my house in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, a Linksys wireless router sits in the window of the apartment of Kevin Milani, a 28-year-old engineering school dropout and marketing consultant. As one of the far-flung band of people who have posted listings on the Web site of NYC Wireless, he invites those within range to use the bandwidth streaming into his house through a D.S.L. account provided by Panix, a New York company. It is one of many "stoop networks" to be found in Brooklyn.
"I have a lot of bandwidth I'm not using, so I might as well share," he said.
This is the remarkable idea at the heart of the free wireless movement. It's as if he invited people within 150 feet to watch whatever cable stations he happened not to be watching at the moment. 
Nor is he overly concerned with the risks of leaving his electronic front door open. "A person could actually do quite a bit of damage if they wanted," he said. "I have backups. I am at risk just being connected to the Internet." As for his potential redistribution of the bandwidth provided by Panix, he said: "I don't think they really care. They're a bunch of techies."
But Panix does care. For residential accounts, says the company's president, Alexis Rosen, this is "strictly prohibited." For business users, it is "strongly discouraged." Predictably, large providers like Time Warner also take a dim view of bandwidth sharers. "The fact that the technology exists to go a couple of hundred feet is irrelevant in our minds," said Joseph DiGeso, vice president and general manager for high-speed online services at Time Warner Cable of New York. "The ability to tap into a phone line or cable box has existed for years, but it doesn't make it legal."
A larger concern for Mr. Rosen is security. The spread of broadband Internet has resulted in scores of connected computers that are, in effect, servers unto themselves. Mr. Rosen worries that such wireless arrangements are vulnerable to hackers or "script kiddies," less technically proficient users who simply use code-breaking software.
"If you open your network to any fool who's got a wireless card in their machine," Mr. Rosen said, "they can use your machine to execute a bandwidth attack, or they can be the victim of a script kiddie and be used to execute an attack. And we can't even figure out who they are. We can only trace it back to you." 
The electronic city is still fairly porous, as was demonstrated by a recent series of expeditions of the World Wide War Drive. War driving means cruising through the city logging unsecured access points. Christopher Blume, the 16-year-old New York coordinator of the war drive, trolls through Manhattan like a Baedeker of the ether.
"You learn to look for the abbreviations as you're driving by," he says. "Take 'Bndemo.' You wouldn't think anything of that. But where I drive by, that's Barnes & Noble." (This summer, after the magazine 2600 published a log of the bookseller's network activity, including credit card numbers, the network was closed.)
Mr. Townsend of NYC Wireless concedes the additional security risks of a public wireless network, but adds that any network has its vulnerabilities. "I can sit here in my office and sniff the traffic going over the local network," he said. As for al Qaeda or child pornographers using Bryant Park, he argues that there is nothing anyone can do on a wireless network that couldn't be done at the public library. 
With all their promise and peril, the emerging wireless networks raise the perennial questions about the dynamics and very nature of urban space. Can public life ever be made truly safe? How do you balance private and public space? What does the geographic distribution of the wireless networks say about the socioeconomic makeup of a city, especially one as large and complex as New York? 
Quite a lot, as Marcos Lara, founder of the Public Internet Project, found out this summer. He and a research team, using a global positioning system, a laptop and an antenna, conducted a four-month survey of all wireless access points in Manhattan (www.publicinternetproject.org). Mr. Lara, 28, formerly of NYC Wireless and part of the Bryant Park initiative, is now working to bring broadband access into underserved communities. He also sells the results of his findings, correlated in a plotted, thematic map that, as he puts it, represents a "one-of-a-kind look into the use of wireless technologies in daily consumer life."
His drive also cast cold digital light on the notion of urban social disparity.
"It's one thing to hear about it," he said. "It's another thing to actually see it occurring on your screen as you drive down the block. You see the economically depressed areas. You think: 'Well, maybe they have computers. Maybe they have technology.' Then you look down on the screen, and you have this unique portal into their world, and it's a desert."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Gregory L. Jackson And Michael J. Welsh; 
Oakmark Global Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
STRONG cash flow alone won't guarantee a winning stock, say Gregory L. Jackson and Michael J. Welsh, co-managers of the $181 million Oakmark Global fund.
 They know that from experience. In 1999, the managers paid about $18 apiece for shares of Department 56, which produces ceramic Christmas villages and other collectibles. Its net profit margins exceeded 16 percent, Mr. Jackson recalled, and it had operating margins of more than 29 percent. 
 But the advent of eBay, the online auction house, drove down prices for the ceramic pieces in the secondary market, Mr. Welsh said. Demand for Department 56's products declined, along with its cash flow. The fund sold its last shares in the company for $9.80 each in the second quarter of 2000; the stock now trades at $12.20.
Still, the managers have chosen many winners over the last three years. The fund returned 14.1 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, placing second among its group of 232 world stock funds, which lost 11 percent a year, on average, according to Morningstar Inc. During that time, the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe Australasia Far East index lost 14.8 percent, annualized.
The fund rose 6.4 percent in the last 12 months, versus declines of 14.4 percent for its group and 15.6 percent for the index.
Mr. Jackson, 36, and Mr. Welsh, 39, work for Harris Associates, the fund's adviser in Chicago, which manages about $29 billion for institutions and individuals.
Oakmark Global owns about 30 companies of all sizes, in the United States and around the world. The managers are "value investors at heart," Mr. Jackson said. "We try to buy businesses at substantial discounts to the underlying business value," he added.
To find potential purchases, the managers use a variety of valuation analyses. Their goal is to find companies that sell for 60 percent of what the fund considers their intrinsic value. Typically, the managers use a "discounted cash flow" model, projecting cash flow for five years, then discounting it back. The discount factor varies, Mr. Welch explained, depending on their assessment of a company's cash-flow stability.
For some industry groups, like oil companies, they use a "sum of the parts" valuation analysis, totaling the value of a company's assets. Once they find companies with discounted share prices, the managers look for growth potential. They evaluate a company's competitive position and whether the company is in an expanding industry, and look for management that creates operating efficiencies, so profits grow faster than revenue over time.
The fund began buying shares of Vivendi Universal in July and have paid an average price of 13.18 euros. When the fund managers totaled the value of Vivendi's utility and entertainment assets, Mr. Jackson said, they figured that its intrinsic value exceeded 25 euros a share. He said that shares were cheap because of the company's financial problems under its former chief executive, Jean-Marie Messier, but that Mr. Messier's replacement, Jean-Rene Fourtou, had a strong track record.
Vivendi stock, which trades on the Paris exchange, is now at 14.18 euros. The company also trades as American depository receipts.
The fund has paid an average of $48.16 for shares of Synopsys, an electronic design automation company in Mountain View, Calif., that now trades at $51.72. Synopsys, which designs software used by Motorola, Intel and others to make semiconductor chips, is "the only technology company we found that has real 'pull' demand," Mr. Jackson said, explaining that its software is so important to customers that they must buy it to keep their competitive position, even in a weak economy. 
THE fund has bought shares of ITT Educational Services, which offers technology-oriented degree programs, three times since the portfolio started, selling as valuations increased and buying again when prices fell. It has been the fund's most profitable stock, Mr. Jackson said.
They most recently bought shares in September, paying an average of $17.10 a share, a little less than half of what they believed the stock was worth. It now trades at $23.23.
The shares have been battered because many investors believe that the slump in technology spending will result in declining school enrollments, Mr. Jackson said. But earnings are growing, he said, adding, "When people are laid off, or fear being laid off, they go back to school for additional training."

HEADLINE: An Alliance That Really Works 

BYLINE:  By Michael McFaul; Michael McFaul is associate professor of political science at Stanford and a fellow at the Hoover Institution.

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
The celebration in Prague should have been more raucous. The most successful alliance in world history has extended to corners of Europe unimaginable just a few years ago. The military capacity gained for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from expansion is minimal but the political returns will be fantastic. More than any other institution, NATO has helped make Europe democratic, peaceful and whole. What is particularly striking about the new members -- Slovenia, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia -- is how many of them emerged from Communist rule with no democratic traditions. The pull of NATO, the desire to join this Western club, created real incentives for democratic consolidation.
 But while the destruction of the old Communist regimes was complete, the construction of democratic regimes has been partial. Of the 28 states that abandoned communism after the Soviet collapse, less than half can be considered liberal democracies, six are dictatorships and the rest -- including Russia and Ukraine -- teeter between democracy and dictatorship. 
 There are many reasons for this mixed record since the cold war. Anti-Communist opposition movements in East Central Europe had coalesced and hardened well before 1989, giving them a jumpstart to democracy once Russia's president, Mikhail Gorbachev, signaled that he would not intervene to save communism there. Likewise, nationalism created the glue for strong opposition movements in the Baltic states. Pro-democracy movements in Central Asia, by contrast, had barely begun when these states acquired independence suddenly and without demanding it in 1991.
Agreement about the borders of a state also has been critical to democratic consolidation. Countries whose borders are well defined, like Poland, Hungary and even Mongolia, have made the transition to democracy much quicker than places where borders are contested -- for example, Armenia, Georgia and most of the states that emerged from Yugoslavia.
Another critical factor is the uneven role that Western states, and the United States in particular, played in promoting democracy in the post-Communist world. In Central and Eastern Europe, American assistance organizations and international financial institutions poured billions in right away. Places farther south and east received less attention. Poland got a stabilization fund for its currency. Russia did not. The Clinton administration even resorted to bombing (in Serbia) as part of a successful strategy for undermining despots. Not so in Belarus or Uzbekistan.
The gap between American rhetoric and the resources devoted to promoting democracy in the former Soviet Union is startling. After Sept. 11, even the rhetoric has become muted; many of the region's dictators, notably Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan, have become American allies in the war against terrorism.
This uneven legacy of democracy in the former communist world offers some important lessons for American foreign policymakers gearing up to promote freedom in the Middle East and South Asia. One lesson is hopeful. Thirty years ago, experts believed that Slavic nations and Communist regimes could never become democratic. They were wrong. Experts now warn that Arab nations, particularly aristocratic or despotic regimes in North Africa and the Middle East -- and perhaps Muslims generally -- just cannot join the democratic world. They should go back and read what Sovietologists were saying as recently as the 1980's.
The other lessons are more sobering. Most importantly, the destruction of dictatorships does not lead smoothly to democracy. President Bush, in the preamble to his new National Security Doctrine, recently declared, "The great struggles of the 20th century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, democracy, and free enterprise." Proponents of liberty in Uzbekistan, Belarus and even Russia would have to question this judgment. The victory was partial, not decisive.
Democratization has seemed to be strongest in countries near stable, established democracies, which does not augur well for the Middle East. With the greatest concentration of dictatorships in the world, this region will not benefit from anything like the pull of NATO and the European Union.
The problem of contested borders as an impediment to democracy also looms large in the Islamic world. The highest objective in Iraq may soon become the avoidance of state dissolution. Territorial disputes in Kashmir, Palestine and Chechnya continue to help block democratic consolidation in all of these regions.
To have any success in creating what President Bush called a "balance of power that favors human freedom" in the Islamic world, the United States will need a better game plan than it had for the end of communism. Strategic thinkers in the Bush administration must have a robust and comprehensive plan for fostering liberty after the fall of dictatorship. Bigger budgets and smarter plans for democratic assistance and economic development ought to be key components.
A NATO for the Middle East and South Asia might be another. As the cliche goes, NATO brought peace to a war-torn continent by keeping the Americans in, the Germans down and the Russians out. A NATO-like organization for the Middle East could keep the Americans in, dictators down and terrorists out. It may be far-fetched, but so was the idea half a century ago that a Western alliance in a ruined Europe would survive into the 21st century -- and expand into the former Soviet Union.

 But such was the scene last week, when a coalition of Christian and Jewish religious leaders came here to press automakers for more fuel-efficient vehicles, and were ferried between General Motors and the Ford Motor Company by a convoy of nuns driving the Toyota Prius, a small car that combines gas and electric power. The slogan, which attracted much attention, was the work of Evangelical Environmental Network, a small grassroots group. 
 These are strange times for the Big Three automakers. Republicans control Washington, gas is cheap and light truck sales are stronger than ever, but the domestic automakers' cash cow, the sport utility vehicle, is being challenged. There is new competition from foreign automakers, and the vehicle has a growing list of critics more powerful than some activist Episcopalians. 
There is California, which sets its own clean-air regulations and plans to force automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions and sell some emission-free vehicles. Not only is California the largest auto market, other states are allowed to follow its guidelines instead of Washington's.
While the government in Washington will be in Republican hands, the California legislature stayed firmly Democratic. 
"The legislature is largely the same as it was before, perhaps a little bit more liberal," said Gloria Bergquist, spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the industry's main lobbying group.
If that weren't enough, foreign competitors like Toyota, Honda and Nissan, which have traditionally left big S.U.V.'s and pickups to Detroit, are now flooding the market with light trucks. Toyota's share of the light truck market, which includes S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans, is growing rapidly; 42 percent of its sales in the United States came from light trucks last month -- compared with 63 percent for Ford -- and more S.U.V. models are expected. 
And while the Big Three have pushed a price war to the brink -- it's hard to go far beyond zero percent financing -- companies like Honda maintain sales with far lower incentives and have more flexibility to lower prices. 
The new competition is Detroit's "biggest problem in terms of their North American automotive operations," said David Healy, an analyst with Burnham Securities. The Big Three's automotive profits come entirely from light-truck sales in the United States. "It's hard to convince buyers that their S.U.V.'s are as good as the Asian brands," Mr. Healy said. 
Then there is the changing political sentiment on oil consumption, partly because of Sept. 11. It's no surprise that Tom and Ray Magliozzi, the host of "Car Talk" on National Public Radio, have begun an anti-S.U.V. campaign, distributing "Live Larger, Drive Smaller!" bumper stickers. But car manufacturers also face criticism from supposed friends. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who will be the new chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, is clamoring for action on fuel economy. And Automotive News, a company-town publication, wrote an editorial pressing the industry to come up with a plan to lessen oil consumption. 
Will Detroit listen? 
Last week, Ford sent its heaviest hitter, William Clay Ford Jr., the green-minded chairman and chief executive, to meet with the religious groups. General Motors, which has led lobbying efforts against higher federal fuel economy standards, sent lower-level officials. And Chrysler? The company, which makes more light trucks as a percentage of their total sales than any other automaker, sent back a form letter encouraging the groups to look at their Web site. Officials at Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, have said there was possibly a miscommunication with the company's corporate chiefs in Stuttgart, but the religious leaders are still waiting to hear back. 
"The faith community has a role to play in getting people to change the way they think about things," said the Rev. Robert Edgar, a former Pennsylvania Congressman. He is the general secretary of the National Council of Churches of Christ, a coalition of 36 different Protestant, Orthodox and Anglican denominations.
But on fuel economy, the automakers showed no hint of backing down on regulatory issues. 
"Big pickups and big S.U.V.'s could have pretax profits as high as $8,000 a vehicle," said Mr. Healy, adding "the cash cow has been milked quite a bit over the last few years." 
Judging from Detroit's newest brand, G.M.'s Hummer, the milking will continue.

HEADLINE: Holidays Turn Into Hollywood's Hot Season 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN and LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
This holiday season's extraordinary crush of big, expensive films mixed with the usual array of smaller Oscar hopefuls has provoked an all-out Hollywood jousting match over movie release dates, the positioning of trailers in theaters and generally how to squeeze the last dollar out of what has become, day for day, the most lucrative period of the year.
 For studio executives, armed with elaborate and costly marketing plans, and for fans, who will spend several hundred million dollars at theaters before New Year's, the rush of films has transformed the season into a sort of July at Christmas. 
 Not very long ago, Hollywood aimed its most expensive froth -- popcorn flicks, as they are known in the trade -- at the height of summer, while filling the holiday period with perhaps one or two such films alongside adult-oriented Oscar fare.
But as the cost of making and marketing movies has skyrocketed amid shrinking profit margins and plummeting stock prices, a different scenario has emerged. 
Gradually over several years, and particularly this year, the prestige studio movies -- like "Schindler's List" -- have all but disappeared from the holiday schedule. In their place, with a few notable exceptions, come more and more sequels, remakes, spinoffs and other risk-averse, mass-market fare driven by the need for fast dollars. The smaller, Oscar-friendly films like last year's "Monster's Ball" are still released, but generally only in a few theaters so that they can qualify for the big awards and, it's hoped, catch on in the slow days of winter.
"The heart of the holiday season is widely seen as the best 12 to 14 days of the year," said Rob Friedman, vice chairman of Paramount Pictures. "And when you add the proximity of the Oscars and other awards, it tends to make it the highest traffic period of the year. Much more than summer."
It is the popcorn flicks that this year more than ever set the tone, both in terms of their sheer numbers -- more than a half-dozen, double that of last year -- and because they seem to point the way to Christmases Future.
"It is clearly more competitive this season," said Richard Parsons, chief executive of AOL Time Warner. "But what isn't more competitive these days?"
Making the battle for success all the more important is that the studios, which this year have enjoyed record grosses expected to top $9 billion, are being counted on to keep funneling torrential revenues to the beleaguered media conglomerates that own most of them and whose stock prices have dropped by as much as 80 percent this year.
"The biggest challenge is the financial one, getting a return on your investment," said Richard Cook, chairman of Walt Disney Studios. "It's the bottom line that counts. Do I think it will get tougher? Yes, I think so. But we all know what our marching orders are."
The pressure has transformed the year-end period into a nerve-rattling sprint for the major studios and for many of their top stars, who this year include several with much at stake as well, including Jennifer Lopez, Leonardo DiCaprio and Halle Berry.
Probably no studio has more at risk than MGM which opened the latest 007 thriller, "Die Another Day," on Friday. At the beginning of the year, executives were so optimistic that bankers shopped the studio to possible buyers, hoping it could fetch as much as $7 billion. But MGM had a dismal first half of the year, with three expensive box-office bombs -- "Rollerball," "Hart's War" and "Windtalkers." Its stock price hit a four-year low of $9.40 in August, 58 percent off its high of $22.27 in January, and any thought of a sale evaporated. But there is always James Bond, this year in the potentially uplifting arms of Ms. Berry. Yes, said Chris McGurk, MGM's vice chairman, 007 could still turn things around.
There are plenty of other studio dramas.
Universal Pictures, now part of Vivendi Universal, a French-owned conglomerate that is trying to reinvent itself and lift its lagging stock price, is banking on holiday movies like the Eminem hit "8 Mile."
Miramax Films, which has lacked a single breakout hit this year, is betting on the release of more than a half-dozen films, including "Chicago," the first film version of a Broadway musical made in years.
The studio's biggest gamble is Martin Scorsese's "Gangs of New York," a long-delayed, $110 million epic about ethnic conflict in 19th-century Manhattan that became notorious for the richly rumored and frequently denied battles between its director, Mr. Scorsese, and Harvey Weinstein, a cofounder of Miramax. Word from initial industry screenings last week was that it may not be the debacle-in-the-making some had forecast, but an early Oscar front-runner.

Birth of a Season
Why December Is the New July
"In the beginning, there was no such thing as a holiday movie season," said Jeanine Basinger, chairwoman of the film studies department at Wesleyan University. "You just released movies."
The turning point came with two 1970's summer films, "Jaws" and "Star Wars," which generated huge audiences in their opening weekends and a repeat trade, made up mostly of young males.
The notion of a movie season was born. Soon, studios were jockeying over the most lucrative opening weekends, which usually meant prime summer weekends. Then, in 1997, came a movie phenomenon.
"If I had to point to one thing that created this recent explosion in franchise movies during the holidays, I'd point to 'Titanic,' " said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, a company that monitors box-office activity. "That movie was supposed to come out in the summer, and only came out at Christmas because of post-production delays."
And, of course, it became the biggest hit of all time -- earning $1.8 billion worldwide.
Suddenly, the holiday season looked pretty good. And in no small part because of its growth, the movie industry underwent a sustained period of expanding revenues. This year's box office totals are up about 15 percent over the same period last year. And even with an uninterrupted rise in ticket prices (which have been going up about 5 percent a year) actual attendance has, after remaining relatively flat for the last several years, shot up 13 percent.
Last year, three of the top four movies opened during the holidays -- the first "Harry Potter" was 2001's top film, taking in $317 million in North America; "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" was second, with $313 million; and "Monsters, Inc." was fourth, with $256 million. ("Shrek," released in May, was third.)
For the studios owned by conglomerates whose other divisions can produce tie-in books, DVD's and souvenirs, the success is particularly sweet. Last year's "Harry Potter" and "Lord of the Rings" releases, which were made at studios owned by AOL Time Warner, brought in $2.5 billion between them in ticket sales, home video, merchandising and television rights, according to industry estimates. "If we can create a kind of built-in audience because there are sequels -- that already have buzz -- you don't run the same financial risk," Mr. Parsons said. "You can bet more securely with your assets."

The Battles
The Winner Takes The Magic Weekend
In Hollywood, the holiday season, just like summer, gets longer and longer. It used to start Thanksgiving weekend and end the weekend after Christmas.
But Disney did not wait for Thanksgiving to release "The Santa Clause 2." The movie opened the first Friday in November to give it extra playing days before Christmas. "By the time you get to Christmas, the idea of Santa would have come and gone," said Mr. Cook of Disney. The movie is on its way to grossing more than $100 million.
The studios need all the revenue they can get because, except for a dip in 2001, movies have gotten steadily more expensive to make. The average cost for making a movie rose from $9.4 million in 1980 to $54.8 million in 2000, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. This has been matched by an explosion in the cost of selling and distributing the films. In 1980, the average Hollywood film cost $4.3 million to market. By 2001, that had risen to $31 million.
Big summer and holiday films cost much more -- about $40 million on average, several marketing experts estimated, with some campaigns running to $70 million.
It is not surprising that the pressures have led to fierce jockeying. The placement of preview trailers in theaters months before a movie's release is a prime battleground.
A studio is allowed to put up to 2 1/2 minutes of trailers at the front of its own movies as they go into distribution. After that, it's all negotiable, said John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theater Owners, and each theater chain has its own rules about how many trailers to allow. "The issue of trailer placement has become very complicated and very high pressured," he said. "I would say that many of our film buyers are spending more time negotiating trailer placement than they are negotiating films." The reason is simple: Trailers are the most cost-effective advertising. They play to a captive audience from their rough demographic, and screening is normally free.
New Line Cinema made very sure that the first full trailer of its new "Lord of the Rings" movie reached most theaters before Universal's "Red Dragon," the top box-office movie the first weekend of October.
Positioning movies for the right weekend is, of course, the biggest game.
Earlier this year, DreamWorks and Miramax engaged in an unusually public face-off over which of their holiday movies starring Mr. DiCaprio would open on Christmas Day -- Miramax's "Gangs" or DreamWorks's "Catch Me if You Can," a more light-hearted film directed by Steven Spielberg about a young con man. A mogul staredown developed until, in early October, Mr. Weinstein met with Jeffrey Katzenberg, one of DreamWorks's founders, and agreed to shift "Gangs" by just five days, to Dec. 20.
"It was in everyone's interest to allow each movie to have its moment in time," Mr. Katzenberg said. 

The Making of 'Maid'
Singing a Serenade To a Demographic
"Maid in Manhattan," starring Ms. Lopez, will open Dec. 13. Publicists are touting the movie as her "Pretty Woman," the film that could position her as the next Julia Roberts.
Every step of the way, from concept to its release next month, its producers worried about money and marketing.
Ms. Lopez plays a maid in a swank New York hotel who falls in love with a political candidate, played by Ralph Fiennes, who mistakes her for a guest. The movie was conceived by John Hughes, who wrote and directed "The Breakfast Club" and had written a script called "The Chambermaid" that many executives thought would star Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant.
When that fell through, Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, a partner at Revolution Studios, pitched a similar idea to Ms. Lopez. They started filming last April and planned for a Christmas release with the hope of attracting young girls who would be out of school, and also older men and women.
According to Ms. Goldsmith-Thomas, the budget was estimated at $56 million -- not cheap, but much lower than those of franchise films like "Harry Potter" and "Lord of The Rings," which cost more than $125 million each. Ms. Goldsmith-Thomas would not say what the stars were paid, but two people involved in the film said Ms. Lopez got about $10 million plus a percentage of the box office revenue. Mr. Fiennes, they said, received about $4 million. After producing, writing and directing fees, that left about $29 million, a fairly modest sum for making a film in Manhattan.
To save money, Paul Schiff, a producer for "Maid," said Revolution made a deal with the Waldorf-Astoria to film from midnight to 6 a.m., which allowed the look of a grand hotel without having to take one over. To save more, they built hallways and suites on a sound stage in Yonkers.
Revolution decided last spring that it wanted a December release. But when in December? "We looked at the upcoming movies and no one was sure where they were going to put 'Gangs of New York' or 'Catch Me if You Can,' " said Tom Sherak, another Revolution partner.
They also had to worry about "Two Weeks Notice," which actually does star Ms. Bullock and Mr. Grant; it is to open on Dec. 20 and is sure to attract the same young female audience. Also perceived as competitive was "Analyze That," a sequel to 1999's "Analyze This," starring Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal, which expects an older audience.
And to make matters trickier, Mr. Sherak said, the studio wanted to steer clear of Friday, Dec. 6, because research showed that many women want to get their holiday shopping done early rather than go to the movies.
They settled on Dec. 13, competing against movies designed for vastly different demographics: "The Hot Chick," a comedy starring Rob Schneider aimed at young males; "Star Trek: Nemesis," a sequel aimed at older males (which in Hollywood means over 25); and "About Schmidt," a limited release Oscar hopeful starring Jack Nicholson.
Then came the task of marketing the film. A first move, Mr. Sherak said, was to approach theater owners and make sure the movie trailer appeared before "Sweet Home Alabama," a romantic comedy starring Reese Witherspoon that opened strongly in late October and drew the same sort of audience sought for Ms. Lopez's film.
A result, Mr. Sherak said, was that two months before "Maid" was to hit theaters, and with no other marketing, research indicated that 40 percent of moviegoers were aware of the film. "We needed that," he said.
Mr. Sherak would not disclose the marketing costs, which are being footed by Revolution's partner, Sony Pictures Entertainment, but the average for this type of film is about $40 million. He said that television spots, which began running two weeks ago, would be the biggest expense. Billboard and other outdoor advertising went up a month early, which is common for wide releases. On the publicity front, Ms. Lopez was interviewed by Diane Sawyer for a special edition of ABC's "Primetime" about the movie and her engagement to Ben Affleck. 
The first of a series of two-minute ads hit national television on Nov. 11, during shows like "Friends," with large female audiences. And given Ms. Lopez's large Hispanic following, the studio also ran commercials on Spanish-language stations.
"Word of mouth on this is critical," said Terry Curtin, who heads marketing at Revolution. "On a movie like this, third-party endorsements, reviews, getting people talking, is important."

The Showdowns
They're Running Neck and Neck . . .
The season can already boast solid hits. "The Santa Clause 2" and "8 Mile" stand to become the year's 19th and 20th $100-million movies. The latest Harry Potter movie, which opened later, has already done that.
What will the rest of the year hold?
Can a violent, complex period picture like "Gangs of New York" compete with more mainstream, youth-oriented fare? Which of Mr. DiCaprio's films will do better? Will Ms. Lopez or Ms. Bullock win the romantic comedy sweepstakes? Will "Friday After Next" draw as a sequel? Is there life left in the "Star Trek" franchise? And which of the nearly two dozen limited-release films with Oscar ambitions -- Spike Jonze's "Adaptation," "The Hours" with Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman, and "Chicago" among them -- will get traction in the awards derby?
One thing seems certain: the holiday season will not get smaller any time soon.
The early lineup for 2003 has at least nine big, franchiselike projects, including "Matrix: Revolutions," "Looney Tunes: Back in Action," "Peter Pan," "Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat" and, of course, the final installment in the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy.

HEADLINE: Asia Worries About Growth of China's Economic Power 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM with JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
Ever since 1949, when Mao Zedong proudly declared that "the Chinese people have stood up," China's neighbors have waited warily for the day when its power would match its potential. 
 For many Asians, that moment is nearly here, with nightmares about economic domination more prominent these days than uncertainty about how China might brandish its future military might. The Japanese shudder as growth reports show China zooming upward at 8 percent while Japan's economy stagnates. 
 In middle-income Malaysia, officials and workers are chilled by the spread of "for sale" signs in the country's premier industrial zone, where high-tech foreign investors are pulling out for China. 
"You look at the economic scales -- it's going to be an elephant on one side and a mouse on the other," said Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's senior minister and an elder statesman of Asia who has spoken frankly of the need to accommodate China's rise. 
Regardless of Beijing's efforts to soothe sensitivities, Asian neighbors sense that China's growing strength will cause traumatic shifts in power. A stronger China will undercut the pre-eminence of Japan, challenge America's role as regional overseer and rewrite Southeast Asia's economic and political course. 
As they took stock of their country's status at the Communist Party Congress last week, China's leaders had reason to feel optimistic. But one of their trickiest challenges will be how to exert their economic and political clout without frightening their neighbors into hostile alliances. 
Mr. Lee, for one, seems assured that Beijing's style has changed. "The emphasis is on expanding their influence through the economy," he said. "In the geopolitical sense, they're more concerned now with using diplomacy in their foreign policy, not force." 
Some of the worries of China's neighbors, especially in the economic arena, may indeed be overblown. Not so long ago, Japan was described as the next global superpower. 
Apart from its determination to plant the flag on Taiwan, China is not behaving in an expansionist way, and it still must cope with poverty and other social problems. But its neighbors' fears are often visceral, rooted in historical rivalries as well as current threats to jobs and influence, and they are often expressed with a tinge of bitterness. "Are we to become a vassal of the Chinese dynasty again?" one Japanese official asked. "The stronger China looks to the Japanese, the closer the security arrangement with America has to be. We have no other options." 
In the Malaysian industrial center of Penang last year, some 16,000 jobs disappeared from the high-paying electronics industry, including those of managers and engineers. "Their companies ask them to go to China to help set up factories," Kenneth Stephen Perkins, a union leader, said of such skilled employees. "When they come back to Penang, they are informed they no longer have jobs." 
The Chinese scoff at foreigners' fears, repeating that theirs is a peace-loving nation and that everyone can benefit from China's economic growth. "China is integrated with the world now, and it sees that its chance to achieve development is through economic, not military, means," said Jia Qingguo, a foreign policy expert at Qinghua University in Beijing. Mr. Jia agrees with government officials who say fears often emanate from hostile elements who are out to keep China down. 
China's new tactics were on full view this month at a summit meeting of Asian nations in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. China reached a deal with the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, to prevent clashes in the disputed South China Sea. If carried out in spirit the agreement would ease tensions. Still, every country is aware that official Chinese maps still show its national boundaries overlapping territorial waters claimed by others. 
China and Asean also signed a commitment to forge a free-trade area by 2010 with China as the core -- in effect, an offer by Beijing to help neighbors share in its growth. The agreement was reached more quickly than expected and left Japan a surprised and worried outsider. 
Throughout Asia, a debate is raging over whether China's soaring growth is harming its neighbors. Foreign investment "seems to be sucked in by China," Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, said at a recent conference. 
Despite all the cries of alarm, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore -- all Asean members -- have seen huge increases in exports to China in the past two years as China's factories absorb raw materials and parts from around the region. But there is increasing fear that China has become, almost overnight, a competitor for the sorts of medium- and high-tech industries that still power growth in its more developed neighbors, the so-called Asian tigers.
Competition for foreign investments is especially intense. China's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 prompted a surge in foreign investment -- it may reach a record $50 billion this year -- even as neighbors saw their totals shrink. 
The Malaysian state of Penang has been a center of trade and entrepreneurship since the British East India Company set up a trading post there in 1786. Since the 1970's, it has become a manufacturing hub for the technology industry with Intel, Dell, Motorola, Hewlett-Packard and others investing in four big industrial parks. Recently, however, new investment has dwindled as companies expand in China instead. At least a dozen factories in Penang's industrial zones are now up for sale. 
"Every multinational is telling us that China is the place to be," said Boonler Somchit, executive director of the Penang Skills Development Center, a government-industry endeavor. 
Over time, said Mr. Lee of Singapore, Southeast Asian countries have to recognize that they may largely work as low-end suppliers to China, Japan and South Korea. 
Even Singapore, a center for services and high-tech manufacturing, feels China's heat. Job losses have mounted and the property market has slowed, at least in part because of a diversion of investment and work to China. 
"There's nothing we can do if China decides to put in their resources, catch up and overtake us," Mr. Lee said. "They are in this catch-up phase, and they are thrilled at the prospect of closing in." 
For both the region and the world, the evolving relationship between the two regional giants, Japan and China, is crucial. The relationship is really more of a triangle that includes the United States because of the American military treaty with Japan, its large troop deployments in South Korea, Japan and the Pacific and the American pledge to help Taiwan defend itself. 
In recent ceremonies in Beijing to commemorate the anniversary of diplomatic relations, Chinese and Japanese officials gamely tried to highlight their recent decades of friendship and cooperation. But mutual suspicions run deep, reflecting centuries of stormy history, including Japan's invasion of China in the early 20th century and continuing incidents that inflame tempers on both sides. 
Today in Japan, resentment over what is perceived as Chinese haughtiness is on the rise, fed by Japan's recent crisis in confidence and Chinese needling about historical crimes. Defense planners worry about traditional geographic and strategic matters as well as the economic balance. 
"As China's military power grows they may not actually threaten us directly, but they could more easily intimidate us," said Masashi Nishihara, president of the National Defense Academy in Yokosuka, near a giant American base south of Tokyo. "They will become more arrogant." 
Mr. Jia, the foreign policy expert in Beijing, counters that Japan's suspicions are more a reflection of its own insecurities and guilt. "I think these fears come from the imbalance in growth rates and from Japan's failure to come to terms with its history," he said. 
East Asia's greatest flash point, aside from the Korean Peninsula, is Taiwan. China has been willing to back off from aggressive threats to see how far Taiwan's economic needs will push it into the mainland's fold. But Chinese officials worry that the simmering independence movement in Taiwan could force Beijing to start a war it does not want, and they resent American weapons sales, which they call an obstacle to "peaceful reunification." 
Although Japan, like the United States, officially calls Taiwan part of "one China" and supports a peaceful resolution between Beijing and Taipei, defense planners like Mr. Nishihara raise uncomfortable questions about the future status of the island. "Strategically, if Taiwan falls under Beijing's military control, that would threaten the sea lanes of East Asia, and Chinese forces wouldn't be very far from our territory in Okinawa," he said. 
A former senior American official agreed. "Of course we'd like to see a peaceful settlement, but Taiwan's absorption in a way that puts the Chinese army on the island is not in American or Japanese interests," said the former official, an Asia specialist whose views are shared by many in the Bush administration. "The sea lanes of Southeast Asia are now neutral, but there is a latent expectation in China that the South China Sea is their territory." 
Chinese leaders, in private conversations with American officials, have indicated that they can live with the United States-Japan military alliance because they view it as a stabilizing factor. But in policy institutes in Beijing, many scholars and defense analysts describe the alliance as an artifact that should disappear. 
The Japanese official who spoke about a Chinese dynasty emphasized that Japan did not seek a showdown with China, but he said his country had to prepare for the worst as it expanded its own military defenses and nurtured the American alliance. 
"Japan hopes for a stable China with more democracy," the official said, "but if the Communist Party starts to lose its ability to govern, or if the economy collapses, China could be taken over by extreme nationalists and pursue an adventurist foreign policy."

HEADLINE: Nurses' Association Says in Study that Big Hospital Chain Overcharges Patients for Drugs 

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
Tenet Healthcare, already under scrutiny for receiving unusually high Medicare payments in recent years, apparently charged patients high prices for drugs as well, according to a new analysis by the California Nurses Association to be released tomorrow. In recent years, Tenet-owned hospitals have raised their drug prices to roughly eight times actual costs, the association said. 
 Tenet, one of the nation's largest commercial hospital chains, has come under intense scrutiny for the unusual amount of special Medicare payments it has received in recent years. By raising prices sharply at some of its hospitals, particularly in California, Tenet received hundreds of millions of dollars in special payments. Federal regulators are now looking into those payments to make sure they were proper. Tenet says it has broken no rules. 
 The nurses' association that conducted the new analysis is trying to unionize some Tenet hospitals. It has been a vocal critic of the hospital chain, which has its headquarters in Santa Barbara, Calif. Some of Tenet's nurses are also striking at one of its California hospitals. 
The association has a contentious relationship with Tenet, according to Harry Anderson, a company spokesman. He said Tenet was already conducting an extensive review of its pricing policy, which it expects to complete next month.
Hospitals set charges for drugs and services based on a number of factors, often above true costs, understanding that they are list prices and do not represent what they actually receive. Many government programs pay a hospital less than its cost to treat a patient, regardless of the charges, said Carmela Coyle, an executive at the American Hospital Association. But charging high prices increases the amount hospitals receive from private insurance companies and others. 
The analysis by the nurses suggests that Tenet hospitals were much more aggressive than other hospitals in charging for drugs. Hospitals nationwide marked up their costs by about four times, on average, while Tenet hospitals charged more than eight times their costs, according to the analysis. In California, drug charges for Tenet hospitals were 1,038 percent of their costs.
Some Tenet hospitals set even higher drug prices, according to the analysis. Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center was the most aggressive of the California hospitals, charging 1,841 percent over costs. Redding Medical Center, which is also under scrutiny because two heart doctors there have been accused of unnecessary care, charged 1,465 percent more than its costs for drugs. The two Redding doctors have not been charged with any crime.
Tenet's practice of increasing drug prices is "a principal driver in their overall charges," the list prices that resulted in the higher Medicare payments, said Don DeMoro, the executive director of the Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy, the group that conducted the study. 
While the study focused on Tenet's behavior, the findings suggest a broader issue among all hospitals: that high charges may contribute to health care inflation.
"This is a stealth issue in the debate about prescription drugs," said Charles Idelson, a spokesman for the association. At a time when health care costs continue to spiral upward, the decision by Tenet hospitals and others to charge significant markups is "a national scandal," he said.
"Clearly, that's the one issue no one has looked at" in the debate over how to pay for the high costs of prescription drugs, he said.
While charges influence the payments Tenet receives from government and private insurers, Tenet's Mr. Anderson emphasized that patients and insurers did not typically pay actual charges and that the study did not provide information about the prices actually paid by insurers and others. 
The study compared charges, essentially list prices, for drugs in about 5,000 hospitals with the actual costs of the drugs from 1993 to 1999 and 2000, the most recent information available.

HEADLINE: Easy Credit and Hard Times Bring Foreclosures 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
The epitaphs of foreclosed homes have spread like crab grass across Indianapolis.
 On one block of Dearborn Street on the city's Near East Side, half of the one- and two-family row houses have been shuttered. "This property was found vacant," seven-month-old stickers on one say, "and in accordance with mortgage agreement, HUD or V.A. guidelines, has been secured." 
 Seven miles northwest of downtown, in the tidy young subdivision of Lakeside Manor West, plywood covers two windows of a house with beige vinyl siding and touches of brick. An empty Fanta bottle lies on the vinyl floor of the foyer, and bits of debris cover the living room carpet. 
"Warning," the notice beside the front door declares. "This is the property of the United States government."
Sixty-eight percent of all American families own homes, the most ever and a sizeable increase from 64 percent a decade ago. But in another aftershock of the bingeing 1990's, merchants of the dream have become its morticians. More mortgages than ever are being foreclosed, and more homes repossessed.
Nowhere is the problem more severe than in Indiana, long a leader in home ownership. At midyear, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America found 2.22 percent of Indiana's home mortgages in foreclosure, the most for any state, a trend experts attribute to the state's loose lending regulations and its rising unemployment rate, the byproduct of a struggling manufacturing economy. The home ownership rate here has slipped to 72 percent from 74 percent.
All states are affected. In the three months that ended in June, the association reports, creditors across the country began foreclosing on 134,885 mortgaged homes, or about 4 in every 1,000 -- the highest rate in the 30 years that the association has been monitoring mortgages. Creditors' backlogs of foreclosed homes reached 414,772, another record.
Foreclosures among the 26.4 million families with sound enough credit to get conventional loans are rare but growing. Since late 1999, as the boom was slowing, the association reports, the number of foreclosed conventional loans has climbed 45 percent, to 76,526, the highest level in 11 years. 
They are much higher among low- and moderate-income families with so-called subprime loans -- higher-interest-rate loans made to borrowers with imperfect credit. Of their 5.4 million mortgages, 150,000 were being foreclosed in June.
"We're seeing the implications of reduced standards that subprime lenders applied," said William Apgar, the federal housing commissioner in the Clinton administration, now a senior scholar at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard. "The expectations were that we would see more fail, and now we're seeing them fail."
Mr. Apgar said that people with subprime mortgages, which were rare five years ago but are commonplace now, were eight times more likely to default than those with prime, conventional mortgages.
With the rise in foreclosures, record numbers of families have applied to hold on to their homes under Chapter 13 of the federal bankruptcy code. At midyear, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts reports, Chapter 13 covered 220,720 homeowners, 8 percent more than a year earlier and the most ever. 
Maj. Shirley Challis, who conducts sales of foreclosed property for the Marion County Sheriff's Department here, said she listed fewer than 1,000 a year five and six years ago. By Thursday, she had listed 5,532 for this year alone. "That's pretty massive," Major Challis said. 
Each Thursday is Chapter 13 day on the 10th floor of a glass-wrapped office tower in Indianapolis. Tightly scheduled homeowners and their lawyers, and creditors and their lawyers, gather before Ann DeLaney, a federal bankruptcy trustee for the Southern District of Indiana.
The trustee determines what the homeowners can pay on their debts. If they stick to the plan, their slates are cleared in three to five years.
"You're going to have people who are abusing the system," Ms. DeLaney said. "But you get a lot more people who are struggling. They are trying to do the right thing. But one small thing can put them into a debt spiral. They don't have a great amount of debt." Apart from the mortgage, it is usually $8,000 to $10,000, she said.
Sandra Weaver, 38, and her husband, Michael Weaver, 39, came in with their lawyer, Mark Zuckerberg. They have two children and a house on three-quarters of an acre. 
Mrs. Weaver lost her factory job making plastic bags and took another job, paying half as much, at a convenience store. Mr. Weaver makes aircraft parts, but his hours have slowed. "We couldn't catch up with our mortgage payments and didn't want to lose the house," Mrs. Weaver said. "The bank called. We tried to refinance, but people wouldn't let us." 
The Weavers received fliers in the mail from bankruptcy lawyers, including Mr. Zuckerberg. He worked out a plan to pay off $9,000 in delinquent debt, mostly the mortgage. "They're paying 100 percent," Mr. Zuckerberg said. "They'll make it."
Foreclosures have been climbing in spite of a five-year-old Department of Housing and Urban Development program intended to hold them down. When a family falls behind in payments, HUD sends the lender a check for the delinquent amount. The homeowner signs a note promising to repay the agency without interest. A senior HUD official said 72,000 families were participating this year, almost three times the number three years ago.
Families fall behind because of lost jobs in the sour economy, medical emergencies and divorce. They trip on credit cards and inflated expectations for their incomes. "They signed up to be in the situation they're in," said Mildred Wilkins, a real estate agent here who sells foreclosed homes and runs a consumer advocacy firm, Home Ownership Matters. But many also succumb to fine print, slick salesmanship, deception and fraud, she said. 
In the 90's, she said, "builders and lenders did not present all the facts. People were enticed into situations they did not understand, and they ended up getting duped."
In two big settlements to stop predatory lending, CitiGroup Inc. agreed in September to reimburse buyers $215 million, and in October, Household International agreed to pay up to $484 million.
Larry Alrey Jr., 37, could be next in court. He was paying $1,232 a month for two mortgages on a home in Clearbrook Park, a new, moderate-income subdivision on the city's south side. Moving from a trailer with his wife and 3-year-old son, he bought the house six years ago for $98,000. 
Two years ago he was fired from a job managing a dry-cleaning store that he had held for 11 years. His wife, who earned about $11,000 a year from two part-time jobs, left him. He found another dry-cleaning job, paying $38,000 a year, but the business declined, and in September he lost the job. 
Mr. Alrey is collecting unemployment benefits while scouring the city to find work. "It's bleak," he said. He has sent out 80 resumes, he said, and delivered 35 more to prospective employers. 
His larger mortgage, on which he pays $844, is three months' delinquent. "The mortgage company is turning me over to their attorneys," he said. "They're saying I have to come up with half of what I owe," about $1,300. Failing that or missing another payment, he can expect the sheriff to serve him with a foreclosure notice. 
In foreclosure-prone neighborhoods, house prices are dropping, too. The developer's discreet welcome sign to the 303 houses in Indianapolis's Bayswater subdivision advertises prices in the "low- to mid-100's." Those were the prices in the late 1990's. But records of 75 sales from January 2000 to September of this show an average price of $95,000. HUD repossessed 8 of the 27 sold this year, 4 more than in 2000.
Jim Albin, 28, an Indianapolis police officer, has lived in a three-bedroom house in Bayswater for five years and wants to move to something bigger. "We're kind of stuck," he said. A year and a half ago, he said, a neighbor with a house like his put it on the market for $104,000. "They haven't been able to sell," he said. "They've gotten a new appraisal, for $20,000 less."
Of his neighbors being foreclosed, Mr. Albin said: "I'm a big advocate of personal responsibility. But sometimes these companies throw the American dream in your face. You get a fast-talking lender. I can see why normally levelheaded people get sucked in."

HEADLINE: AIDS Imperiling African Armies, Key to Stability of Many Nations 

BYLINE:  By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: LUANDA, Angola 

 BODY:
First Sgt. Domingos Leiria may be the future of the Angolan Armed Forces. 
 Like thousands of other soldiers in Angola, and thousands more across Africa, Sergeant Leiria has H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. 
 Struggling to stay fit for duty, he is fighting a battle he does not expect to win. But the war is one that the armed forces of Africa, already the epicenter of the epidemic, cannot afford to lose. 
For better or worse, no institution is more central to the stability of many African nations than the military, and few institutions in Africa are more threatened by AIDS. 
At Angola's central military hospital here in the capital, AIDS has surpassed malaria as the leading cause of death, and after the long civil war, the situation will almost certainly worsen. 
"With the end of the war, we expect there will be an explosion in numbers," Dr. Francisco Ernesto, the commander of the military health service, said in an interview. 
But leaders here are not the only ones who have reason to be alarmed. Africa is figuring in American foreign policy more than at any other time since the end of the cold war, both in terms of economic security and military strategy. 
The United States is importing more and more oil from West Africa, particularly Angola and Nigeria, to reduce its reliance on the volatile Middle East. On the other side of the continent, the United States is establishing an antiterrorist command center in the tiny nation of Djibouti and stepping up contacts with Ethiopia and Kenya, all in an effort to build alliances in a region where Al Qaeda has been active, especially in Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
AIDS in the military will undermine such efforts, and that helps explain why the Pentagon is spending several million dollars this year to help Angola and 20 other African countries begin dealing with the crisis. A new Central Intelligence Agency report on AIDS cites Nigeria and Ethiopia, sub-Saharan Africa's two most populous countries, as crucial American security concerns, and the rising toll on their armed forces is part of the reason. 
"A key ingredient of regional cooperation is national militaries that are capable and competent and not dying off because of AIDS," Theresa Whelan, director of the Defense Department's office of Africa policy, said in a telephone interview from Washington. 
Angola's civil war made travel around the country difficult and dangerous, and that kept H.I.V. from spreading as much as it has in the rest of southern Africa.
But the war ended this year, after nearly three decades of fighting, and millions of Angolans are on the move, making their way back to villages and towns they abandoned long ago. H.I.V., now estimated to infect 5.5 percent of adults in Angola, will not be far behind, experts say.
"People couldn't move," said Dr. Eric Bing, an assistant professor at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles and the civilian coordinator of the Defense Department project here. "That's about to change."
Soldiers are already among the sick. Some, infected on missions in foreign capitals like Kinshasa and Brazzaville, will carry the virus to their home villages, passing it on to wives and girlfriends. Others risk being infected as the cycle of transmission gathers pace, and prostitutes and truckers also spread the virus as they ply their trades in areas that had long been inaccessible.
Angola has only to look around the continent, to countries like Ethiopia, Nigeria and South Africa; they are all at peace after long periods of upheaval, and like Angola, all aspire to influence and power on the continent. Yet the stability they are trying to entrench and the ambitions they are trying to realize are threatened by AIDS. 
In Nigeria, at least 6 percent of adults are H.I.V.-positive, with the spread fueled by many factors, among them the Nigerian military's emerging role as regional peacemaker.
In Ethiopia, at least 10 percent of the adult population has H.I.V., and the number has been climbing, driven in part by the demobilization of tens of thousands of soldiers after the country's long civil war and more recently after the war against Eritrea. 
In South Africa, which has more H.I.V.-positive people than any other country, roughly one in four soldiers are infected, the Ministry of Defense says.
Sergeant Leiria, a 31-year-old commando, has been an Angolan soldier since 1990. Along with missions around the country, he has been sent to Congo and the Congo Republic, countries where Angola has been instrumental in shoring up embattled governments. 
These days, he is fighting for his own survival. 
He seems fit enough, but he is not. He suffers from thrush, a fungal infection that makes swallowing difficult. He has fought off tuberculosis. He endures debilitating headaches and diarrhea. He is dogged by fever that gives way to chills. 
"Usually, from 4 o'clock, I feel too cold," he says. "Even at the moment, I am too cold." Asked how he contracted H.I.V., he says he does not know. It might have been from shaving with a fellow soldier's razor or perhaps from a battlefield blood transfusion, he says. 
What about sex? he is asked. 
Sent away from home for long stretches, soldiers strike up relationships with local women or prostitutes, though like Sergeant Leiria they often have wives at home. Such liaisons have long spread sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, and now H.I.V. 
"I think it's possible," Sergeant Leiria said. "I cannot lie to you. I walked a lot of places."
Indeed, many soldiers do. The sex is cheap, and in war, life itself seems cheap. Fatalism creeps into their thinking. "People used to say we should enjoy life," Sergeant Leiria said. "If we get it, we get it."
Slowly, though, he and others in the military say, reckless behavior is waning, but too late for Sergeant Leiria. 
Sitting in a quiet corner of a downtown hotel, he was dressed in gray jeans, a dark T-shirt and calf-high combat boots that were the only obvious hint of his work. Soon, he said, he will be shedding the uniform altogether. "I want to be demobilized, because of the AIDS, because I need to rest," he said. "I fought a lot and I didn't manage to do almost anything with my life. Now I want to do something in my life. I have children. I have a wife."
It is a painful decision for a man who has known little besides a soldier's life. When he tested positive in 2000, horrified relatives turned their back on him, and he contemplated killing himself. 
Since then, he and some of his relatives have come to accept his fate, helped by an AIDS support organization. None of that has helped to arrest the march of the disease. Without consistent access to the anti-retroviral drugs that have made the disease manageable for many people in the West, Sergeant Leiria has little hope. "If I was like other people who have a lot of money -- they go abroad to buy medicines, they go to South Africa for treatment -- then I could continue," he said.
While Angola is a long way from wielding the broad influence of South Africa or Nigeria, it has fashioned itself into a regional power, and its military, as the fulcrum of power in the country, will remain for now an important engine of the country's aspirations -- and a crucial component in the fight against AIDS.
Like other countries, Angola does not know exactly how many soldiers are H.I.V.-positive, and so it is planning a survey with the help of Dr. Bing and other specialists. 
The United States military does not enlist anyone who has tested positive for H.I.V., but does not discharge people solely on the basis of infection with the virus unless the symptoms of AIDS render them physically unfit to serve.
Experts say the survey is likely to show that the prevalence is higher than the current estimate of 5.5 percent of adults, and likely to increase. The question is whether Angola will contain the surge. Like many African countries, Angola is too poor to think about providing treatment for most of its H.I.V.-positive people, so for now the efforts focus on prevention. 
On the main military base here in the capital, 18 young soldiers were training to teach their colleagues to defend themselves against H.I.V. This is the military's new war, symbolized by the soldier depicted in the class manual, his old weapon -- a gun -- in one hand, his new weapon -- a condom -- in the other.
Maj. Fernando Paxiao Damiao, the doctor in charge of the training, wants to think that his efforts will do some good, but on the future of the armed forces sees little to be cheerful about. "We're going to have an army of sick people," he said.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Cure for Boy's Skin Disorder Is Financial Stability

BYLINE:  By ARTHUR BOVINO

 BODY:
Some people are good at concealing their emotions. Sure, they worry -- about school, about family. But no one would know it by looking at them.
 But Max Noto wasn't like that. For him, worry was not only something he carried around on the inside. He wore it on the outside, too. 
 When Max, 11, was worried, he broke out in a rash. He would have redness, along with blisters and scaling, and dry patches up and down his arms and legs. For years, Max has had eczema, and when he itched, he scratched, aggravating his condition. Sometimes, he grew so anxious that the rash crept onto the side of his face. 
Max worried about all kinds of things. Like other boys, he became stressed about math tests and how his sports favorites, Kurt Warner and the Rams, were doing. He also worried about the rashes themselves, and about being teased.
"They told me I had cancer," Max said of his fellow students. "I just left them alone."
His mother, Josephine Noto, said he often came home from school upset. "Children would make fun of him and told him that it was AIDS," said Ms. Noto, 32, who lives in Brooklyn with her son. "He used to say, 'God, why me, why would I have to get this?' "
Mostly, though, Max worried about his mother. He wanted her to be happier. "She gets anxiety sometimes, and I get worried when she goes through that, too," Max said.
After a succession of jobs, Ms. Noto was unemployed in 2001 and had her own worries about how to make ends meet. She needed to learn a trade that would support her and her son, but she was also occupied with raising Max on her own. The Shorefront Y.M.-Y.W.H.A. of Brighton-Manhattan Beach provided a solution: an after-school program and a summer camp for Max that freed her to take hairstyling classes.
The Shorefront Y.M.-Y.W.H.A. is a beneficiary of the UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven local charities that participate in The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
Max and his mother came to the United States from Mondovi, Italy, in 1996 when he was 5. His father came with them. Ms. Noto's grandmother was a United States citizen. 
Max was shy and nervous in school. Learning English took him a year.
But that was not the only adjustment he had to make. Within the year, his father, unhappy in American, had left Ms. Noto and Max on their own, returning to Italy.
Max's rashes became a severe problem when he turned 9. A doctor prescribed steroids. Max usually wore long-sleeved shirts, but his school uniform had short sleeves, exposing his rashes, and he was embarrassed.
Ms. Noto, struggling with her own tough adjustment, took whatever jobs she could find: at a dry cleaner's, as a waitress, and at a bakery. But she could not earn enough. Eventually she got a job filing and answering the phones at a city marshal's office. When she was laid off, Ms. Noto decided that the only way to provide a good home for Max was to learn a more valuable skill.
"Being a stylist has always been my dream, so I went for that," she said. She took out a $10,000 loan for her vocational training at the Learning Institute for Beauty Sciences in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. She started her classes full time in May 2001.
While she was in class, Max did his homework in the after-school program at the Y.M.-Y.W.H.A. The program is financed by money donated to the Neediest Cases Fund.
"I noticed Max was very shy," said Shirley Pineiro, the director of the after-school program. "I noticed he had a rash. I asked Josephine, 'Is there something I should know?' "
Ms. Pineiro said she realized that Max's problems were related to his worries about his mother. Her relationship with Ms. Noto grew, and Ms. Noto eventually confided a deep worry of her own: she did not know how to care for Max over the summer while also attending classes. If she went to school only part time, she would need a year and a half to complete her studies.
"He was worrying a lot about Mommy," Ms. Pineiro said. "You don't have to tell children, 'I don't have rent money,' but they know. So he was really breaking out at one point."
Ms. Noto said that his flesh had been rubbed raw.
Ms. Pineiro spoke with Susan Fox, the executive director of the Shorefront Y.M.-Y.W.H.A. Ms. Fox suggested that Max attend the Macabi day camp at Shorefront over the summer. She offered to pay for part of the camp's cost using $306 from the Neediest Cases Fund, with the rest coming from a grant.
At the camp, Max went on trips to the beach and the movies. He began to interact with other children.
When Max started a new school year, Ms. Noto was able to continue her classes. She finished last January and found work as an assistant. In August, she passed the state cosmetology exam and received her license. She is now styling hair at a salon in Bay Ridge, where she is working toward building up her clientele.
Now Ms. Noto is better able to meet her bills and provide for Max. His anxiety has subsided, along with those telltale marks on his skin.
Max is not totally worry-free. He still has problems with his math homework. The number sequences give him trouble, but his grades have improved.
"I had a problem today in English class and I asked my English teacher about the homework and she helped me," Max said.
At one time, he would have suffered quietly with his anxiety. He would have carried it on the inside and worn it on the outside, too.
"Asking for help requires a certain level of confidence," Ms. Fox said, "and that's really a milestone of maturation. It's exciting to see."

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "The Sons Also Rise," by Paul Krugman (column, Nov. 22), raises the question of why society acquiesces in policies that favor some of its members more than others -- for example, when people with little to gain from Republican economic proposals nevertheless vote Republican. 
 The simple answer may be that the allure and promise of expanding capital, no matter how unobtainable for many Americans, are enough to override concerns about the inequality it invariably creates. Many people like to think they could become rich, and indeed may identify with the rich in some way, even if wealth will probably never come in their lifetimes. The G.O.P. has taken advantage of this phenomenon.

How One Group Gives McGreevey the Business

BYLINE:  By George James 

 BODY:
The last two years have been tough on New Jersey employers, and, as far as one organization is concerned, Governor McGreevey has not fared much better.
 In an annual survey made public last week by the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, the state's employers gave Mr. 
McGreevey the lowest job approval rating since 1993, when another Democrat, Jim Florio, held office. 
 Fifty percent of the employers surveyed scored Mr. Greevey's performance in his first year in office as poor; 38 percent allowed it was fair; and only 11 percent said it was good, the same rating Mr. Florio got.
By comparison, Gov. Christie Whitman, a Republican, received a 77 percent approval rating for her first year in office and never dropped below 58 percent.
What particularly "riled" the employers were the governor's increase in the corporate tax to balance the budget and his policy of requiring union laborers for public projects.
"Governors can't change basic economic conditions, but they can set a tone for how business is viewed," said Philip Kirschner, executive vice president of the 18,000-member group. "One of the first things Governor Whitman did is say, 'New Jersey is open for business.' "
To Kevin Davit, Mr. McGreevey's press secretary, the organization could not have phrased it more aptly, remarking that Mrs. Whitman "left us with an empty cupboard."
"Not only were the citizens of New Jersey misled about the health of the state's economy, but the business people were as well," Mr. Davit said. George James

HEADLINE: Indians See Their Political Influence Rising in Ecuador 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
Barely making ends meet, Jose Morales blames a string of corrupt governments for his misery, saying they have marginalized him and other Indians. But their moment may have come. 
 In Ecuador's presidential election on Sunday, Mr. Morales plans to vote for a former army colonel hailed as a corruption fighter for overthrowing the troubled government of President Jamil Mahuad in 2000. The former colonel, Lucio Gutierrez, who has been leading in the polls, is popular among indigenous groups that feel that traditional politicians have long ignored them. 
 "We are poor and Lucio Gutierrez is conscious of that and wants to help," said Mr. Morales, a 34-year-old traveling salesman. "I believe in him. He is poor, too, and that is why I want to see him win." 
Political experts expect Indians to vote for Mr. Gutierrez, 45, in big numbers against his opponent, Alvaro Noboa, who controls the world's fourth largest banana company. 
For Indians, the victory would underscore their growing political power. Once shunned by public officials and hamstrung by discrimination, indigenous groups have vastly increased their influence, and have established themselves as a force in the uprising against Mr. Mahuad. 
Experts say Indians from the Pachakutik political movement or their allies now hold about a dozen seats in the 100-member Congress and control about 10 percent of the country's city halls. Indians, who make up a quarter of the nation's population, gave Mr. Gutierrez crucial support in his first-place finish among 11 candidates in the first round of voting on Oct. 20. 
"What is happening now is the accumulation of a historic process," said Luis Olmedo Iza, who shapes economic policy for the Ecuadorean Indigenous Nationalities Confederation. "This demonstrates the force of our organization, the militancy of our indigenous people." 
But just as Indian groups appear ready to triumph, questions are being raised about how much influence they would truly have in a Gutierrez government. 
Since being jailed after ousting Mr. Mahuad, Mr. Gutierrez has cast himself as an outsider, railing against market reforms and promising more social spending. He has also called for Ecuador to reconsider its use of the dollar as the national currency. Of late, though, he has toned down his oratory, and has met with economists and analysts to calm jittery investors. 
Mr. Gutierrez said he was not changing positions, but instead was weighing the needs of all Ecuadoreans. Some of his comments, though, have stung his backers, as when he told a television station, "If I win the election, I will be the president, I will govern, not Pachakutik," referring to the Indian political movement. 
In interviews, leaders of three important indigenous groups said they remained firmly behind Mr. Gutierrez, as do left-leaning groups like the Popular Democratic Movement, a Marxist party. 
"We understand that Lucio is sending out a message," said Victor Hugo Jijon, a member of Pachakutik's executive committee. "It is logical that in proposing a project of national unity, our proposals are not the only ones that will prevail." 
Though he is not an Indian, Mr. Gutierrez, with his dark complexion and easy manner, is appealing in a country where a great majority of people are not white but are led by the white minority. 
Mr. Gutierrez stands in stark contrast to Mr. Noboa, a 52-year-old part-time New Yorker who inherited some of Ecuador's richest companies. Though he has cast himself as a populist -- giving out flour and promising to build homes -- Mr. Noboa's farms have had child laborers, and some of his workers have complained of low wages and poor working conditions. A poll released tonight showed him closing a wide gap, with Mr. Gutierrez leading by a statistically insignificant one percentage point over Mr. Noboa. 
Indian groups say they expect Mr. Gutierrez to keep his promises if he is elected. But that will not be easy in a country where the Social Christians, a pro-business, right-of-center party, hold the biggest share of seats in Congress. 
Mr. Iza, of the Indigenous Nationalities Confederation, said Indian groups understood the political realities and were willing to compromise. But they are dedicated to a moratorium on foreign debt payments and to tight parameters on privatization and other market reforms. 
"Lucio Gutierrez will understand that we are not just asking," said Mr. Iza. "We do not just want an electoral victory, but a social victory to change the country."
He added, "We know we cannot change everything, but we can have profound changes in the next four years."

 TAKE ON THE STREET
What Wall Street and Corporate America
Don't Want You to Know: What You Can Do
to Fight Back.
By Arthur Levitt with Paula Dwyer.
338 pp. New York:
Pantheon Books. $24.95.
 ARTHUR LEVITT was one of the last honest men left standing when they put out the lights on the Clinton administration. The longest serving chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (1993-2001), he was charged with regulating America's financial markets during an economic boom that has now gone splendidly bust. Levitt confronted corrupt brokers and analysts who were profiting from insider information. He fought price fixing on the stock exchanges and battled to keep accountants from cooking corporate books. The politicians who served these special interests accused him of being an obstructionist who didn't understand the New Economy. Forget about profits and cash flow, they said. We need a different kind of metrics for measuring how information flows through the new knowledge industries.
This talk of not being able to measure the New Economy was a canard, Levitt says in "Take On the Street." The book retails his numerous struggles and long list of opponents. (It even reproduces some of their correspondence, including a letter of complaint from Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman of Enron.) Levitt is unsparing in his criticism of corporate greed and puffery; he even takes a few swipes at his own early culpability as a player on Wall Street.
After 28 years in the New York financial world, running a brokerage firm that is now part of Citigroup and serving as chairman of the American Stock Exchange, Levitt was not expected to bite the hand that fed him when he was appointed to the S.E.C. But he had grown up watching his father, who served six elected terms as New York State comptroller, fight off politicians who tried to tap into the state's multibillion-dollar pension fund. What is more, Levitt -- and the partners with whom he started his brokerage firm -- knew all the tricks in the trade, including how to lie to Congress on behalf of rich clients, because he had practiced them.
Levitt narrates the story of his Washington years with admirable clarity. First, he went after the bribery and political shenanigans in the municipal bond markets. Next he issued a regulation outlawing companies from leaking their financial reports to stock analysts, which ended their ability to trade on insider information. Then he waged war on the collusive practices and price fixing that were common among Nasdaq dealers and New York Stock Exchange brokers. During his tenure at the S.E.C., Levitt tells us, Nasdaq firms would pay over a billion dollars in damages and fines. He also eliminated billions of dollars in excess fees by demanding that stock prices be quoted not in fractions, but in dollars and cents. 
Levitt did not win all his wars. He describes how he fought but retreated from the battle to count stock options as an expense on corporate income statements. This was the "single biggest mistake during my years of service," he says.
And in a story that means far more to the public today than it did at the time, Levitt battled America's corporate accountants. "Self-regulation by the accounting profession is a bad joke," he writes. He tried to institute rules that would prevent accountants from consulting for the same companies they were auditing. While certifying company books, accountants were simultaneously confecting the recipes for cooking them, he explains. Levitt's chief opponent in his battle against the accountants was a lawyer named Harvey Pitt, who argued that the New Economy would benefit from accountants doing more consulting. Pitt, appointed by George W. Bush to be Levitt's successor, was recently forced to resign his position at the S.E.C.
The politicians who opposed Levitt's activism kept demanding that he produce a "smoking gun." They accused him of being Chicken Little when everyone else in Washington and on Wall Street was looking up at blue skies full of money. Eight months after Levitt left the S.E.C., the smoking gun arrived with the overnight collapse of Enron, America's seventh-largest company. In "Take On the Street," Levitt duly notes the other guns that have been firing regularly as companies go bankrupt and their chief financial officers get paraded to court in handcuffs. 
By the time he left Washington, Levitt had accumulated a tremendous amount of moral capital. If anyone was in a position to write the definitive book on the excesses of the New Economy, it was Arthur Levitt. What he has chosen to write instead is a how-to book for small investors, with a mythical Aunt Edna as his ideal reader. Because he couldn't help himself, or because the premise for the book changed as financial scandals began to hit the news, Levitt also tosses in an analysis of why the system blew up, along with a road map for driving away from the wreckage.
Levitt and his journalist co-author Paula Dwyer have written a first-rate financial primer. The description of how stock markets actually trade stocks and his lessons on how to read financial statements are worth the price of admission alone. Yet there is a strange dissonance as various parts of the book undermine the sunny advice given in other parts. In one chapter Levitt recommends that Aunt Edna buy mutual funds. In the following chapter he details the "seven deadly sins" (hidden fees, portfolio churning, tax liabilities and so on) that allow these funds to make money at Aunt Edna's expense. He celebrates the "information bonanza" that technology makes available to investors, and then he devotes a chapter to explaining how this information is corrupted by corporate accountants. In the end he describes so many financial casualties and details so much corporate chicanery that the only place poor Aunt Edna will want to invest is under her mattress.
The book presents itself as a Take Back the Night rally for small investors, who are exhorted not to leave Wall Street to muggers and stockbrokers. Vigilant investors, by demanding transparent balance sheets and narrow spreads, will make the markets safe again for little old ladies. While the good doctor Levitt is offering this advice, his book is detailing enough horror stories to scare the willies out of you. The scariest of all is the fact that not even the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission knew half the mischief that was afoot on the dark side of the Street.

 FIRST GREAT TRIUMPH
How Five Americans Made
Their Country a World Power.
By Warren Zimmermann.
Illustrated. 562 pp. New York:
Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $30.
 "AMERICANS like to pretend that they have no imperial past," Warren Zimmermann tells us in "First Great Triumph: How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power." But they do. The United States had been expanding its borders from the moment of its birth, though its reach had been confined to the North American continent until 1898, when American soldiers and sailors joined Cuban and Filipino rebels in a successful war against Spain. When the war was won, the United States acquired a "protectorate" in Cuba and annexed Hawaii, the Philippine Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico and Hawaii. "In 15 weeks," Zimmermann notes, "the United States had gained island possessions on both the Atlantic and Pacific sides of its continental mass. It had put under its protection and control more than 10 million people: whites, blacks, Hispanics, Indians, Polynesians, Chinese, Japanese and the polyethnic peoples of the Philippine archipelago." 
John Hay, at the time the American ambassador to Britain, writing to his friend Theodore Roosevelt in Cuba, referred to the war against Spain as "a splendid little war, begun with the highest motives, carried on with magnificent intelligence and spirit, favored by that Fortune which loves the brave." He hoped that the war's aftermath would be concluded "with that fine good nature, which is, after all, the distinguishing trait of the American character." More than a century later, we are still asking ourselves just how splendid that little war and its consequences really were. 
Zimmermann, a career diplomat and a former United States ambassador to Yugoslavia, begins his brilliantly readable book about the war and its aftermath with biographical sketches of the five men -- Alfred T. Mahan, Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge, John Hay and Elihu Root -- who played a leading role in making "their country a world power."
Alfred Mahan, the least known of the group, articulated through his lectures at the Naval War College and his writing the rationale for American overseas expansion, and provided two presidents and their advisers with the military strategy required to achieve it. Theodore Roosevelt, one of Mahan's most enthusiastic readers, was the nation's fiercest proponent of expansionism -- as writer and politician, assistant secretary of the navy, saber-rattling Rough Rider colonel in Cuba, vice president under President William McKinley and president from 1901 to 1909. Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, Roosevelt's friend and political sponsor, forcefully advocated and carried the case for a larger navy and American expansionism in the Senate. John Hay as secretary of state and Elihu Root as secretary of war under McKinley and then Roosevelt were entrusted with administering the overseas islands acquired after the war with Spain and formulating and advocating a foreign policy consistent with America's new global status. 
What may be most remarkable about these remarkable men, at least from our perspective, is that all of them were "intellectuals and thought of themselves as such." Roosevelt was the author of 38 books, Lodge 27; Hay was the co-author of a biography of Abraham Lincoln, and the author of volumes of poetry and a best-selling novel, "The Breadwinners"; Mahan's books and articles on naval and military history won him election to the presidency of the American Historical Association in 1902; Root, a highly successful corporate lawyer before entering government service, became an expert in international law afterward. 
Zimmermann wisely resists making heroes -- or villains -- of his central characters, though he does show a partiality to Hay and Root, the least arrogant and the most humane of the five in their treatment of America's new overseas possessions and peoples. Both also had sparkling senses of humor, which Zimmermann delights in displaying. When the 325-pound William Howard Taft, who as colonial governor in the Philippines reported to the secretary of war, informed Root that he had recovered from illness and "had just taken a long horseback trip into the mountains . . . Root, always fast with a quip, cabled back: 'Fine. How's the horse?' "
Roosevelt, who plays the leading role in the story, is portrayed the least sympathetically. Though Zimmermann admires his "enormous capacity for work," his "extraordinary mental and physical toughness" and his use of diplomacy as president, he has disdain for Roosevelt's "near-hysterical warmongering over Cuba in the 1890's," his "idiotic assertions that America needed a war" to establish its greatness in 1898 and his relentless campaigning for the Medal of Honor after a total of two weeks' combat experience in Cuba. That President Bill Clinton in 2001 posthumously awarded the medal to Roosevelt, when Roosevelt's own contemporaries felt obligated to deny it to him, is noted without comment. 
After offering five rich biographical sketches, Zimmermann merges the stories of his characters into a historical narrative of the decade of American expansionism that commenced with the war against Spain and ran through the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. Human rights considerations, he tells us, were put forward by President McKinley in 1898 as the major reason for intervening in Cuba and have been a stated foreign policy priority since then. Still, Zimmermann argues, human rights had precious little to do with American policy toward Hawaii or Guam or Puerto Rico or the Philippine Islands or the Panama Canal Zone. These territories were added to the American empire because of strategic and commercial considerations. The case of Hawaii was perhaps the most egregious. Here, the human rights of the local population were entirely ignored. A functioning government was overthrown and the political rights of the indigenous peoples were trampled to protect American business interests, enhance the power of the local American minority and secure for the Navy a coveted Pacific port. 
Though the advocates of American imperialism, or what Henry Cabot Lodge called the "large policy," won every argument in the end, they did not always have an easy time of it. The treaty ending the war with Spain and ceding the Philippine Islands to the United States was approved by the bare two-thirds vote of the Senate required by the Constitution.
Outside Washington, the anti-imperialist forces were led by a distinguished group that included Andrew Carnegie, Mark Twain and Samuel Gompers, as well as the president of Harvard University, Charles W. Eliot, the Harvard professors William James and Charles Eliot Norton and the publisher, writer, and former United States Senator Carl Schurz. The anti-imperialists argued forcefully that the United States would surrender its birthright by denying self-government to people who desired it. "If we turn this war, which was heralded to the world as a war of humanity, in any sense into a war of conquest, we shall forever forfeit the confidence of mankind," Schurz wrote President McKinley in the spring of 1898. But neither McKinley nor his successor, Theodore Roosevelt, was listening. The course of empire, the fulfillment of America's manifest destiny, had been set, and there was no turning back. America had come of age as a global power, and as such required new markets for goods and investment, naval bases and coaling stations in the Pacific and hegemony in the Caribbean. 
Zimmermann's biographical approach makes for an engaging narrative, though it occasionally obscures the larger structural imperatives, primarily economic, that underlay American expansionism. What Zimmermann never loses sight of, however, are the racial dimensions of his story. "Imperialism is inherently racist," he reminds us. He demonstrates time and again how the American imperialists applied racial arguments to explain why colonial subjects were not worthy of self-government. The hallowed principles of democracy and self-determination, Senator Albert Beveridge of Indiana explained on the floor of the Senate in 1900, did not apply to Filipinos because they were "not of a self-governing race. . . . Savage blood, Oriental blood, Malay blood, Spanish example -- are these the elements of self-government?" 
Reflection on our imperial past and the history of our relations with the rest of the world may well be in order at this moment in our national history. Warren Zimmermann has provided us with an excellent place to begin.

 A GIRL FROM ZANZIBAR

 WHY isn't that Iraqi doctor practicing medicine? Why is he running a popular cafe in London's Bayswater district? He must be a political refugee, like most of the characters in this timely, entertaining novel about postcolonial migrants trying to survive in Margaret Thatcher's Britain.
The slight time warp adds extra ironies. In mid-1980's London, privatization is still a shocking new tactic. Applied to public housing, it brings windfalls for a few and homelessness for many. AIDS has struck but not yet been identified. The British and the Americans connive with Pakistan's attempts to obtain weapons of mass destruction, the deal financed by a shady international banking network and brokered by a steely Pakistani mercenary whom the Americans invite to train the Nicaraguan contras. He turns them down: he has bigger fish to fry.
These alarming events are filtered through the mind of the title character in Roger King's fourth novel, "A Girl From Zanzibar" -- a naive, ambitious and beautiful young illegal immigrant. Marcella D'Souza is a wonderful invention, a latter-day Candide, an East African on a picaresque voyage of discovery. Her creator specializes in close-up, intimate views of the global economy: the meetings in overheated rooms where the haves decide the fates of the have-nots. He's been in those rooms. As an agricultural economist, he worked for United Nations agencies in Asia and Africa. These days, he lives and teaches in western Massachusetts.
America is not Marcella's land of opportunity; it's where she comes to lie low after her dramatic rise and fall in London. By the time the novel opens, in the late 1990's, she's pushing 40, unmarried, childless, lonely and newly hired to teach multicultural studies at a small college in Vermont. She wonders about her American students. "How can it be that these privileged children of such a big, rich and confident nation are so fragile and lost?" The curriculum is mystifying too. The term "multicultural studies" makes no sense to her, so she promptly revises the course description, arguing that "cultures are just the outcomes of people who moved from somewhere else and would move on" and "nothing is separate, permanent, fixed or owned."
Marcella's life, as she looks back on it, is a case in point. Born from the ruins of three major empires -- the Portuguese, the Arab, the British -- she is, as a friend puts it, a "Goan Indian Portugese Arab African of Catholic Moslem parentage." "You're from everywhere," this friend (an earnest British aid worker who serves as the novel's deus ex machina) tells her. She corrects him: "I'm from nowhere."
Marcella divides this account of her life into sections: "Life Before," "In My Life," "After Life." She doesn't tell her story in chronological order but meanders artfully from then to now and back again, trying to redeem her past, salvage a future. The layering adds depth to a vivid, precise and fast-paced narrative, told with graceful, at times almost arch, concision.
"Life Before" is the nowhere of Marcella's native Zanzibar, waiting for her passport to be granted, arguing with her forceful Aunt Stella, a pillar of the local Goan community. Aunt Stella (or Mrs. F, as she's known), a Dickensian eccentric for sure, insists that Goans are "really Europeans in disguise." "We have European names, some of us have European blood. We've been European for 400 years. We eat beef. We drink alcohol. We ballroom dance. We're European." Naughty Marcella disagrees: "Just because our ancestors were the first to jump into bed with the Portuguese when they arrived in India, doesn't make us European."
This fine comic passage has a grim subtext, since, when independence came to East Africa, Indians and Arabs by the thousands were expelled or killed. Marcella's own father is said to have perished in the massacre that preceded the union of independent Zanzibar with Tanganyika to form Tanzania. Twenty years later, as she prepares to leave the country, violence is still in the air: "The degree of delicacy and tentativeness we brought to our social encounters was that of people tiptoeing among light-sleeping lions."
Marcella makes her getaway at last with the help of a Tanzanian bureaucrat and that well-meaning British aid worker. And the result is a migration from the sorry stagnation of Zanzibar under state socialism to the feeding frenzy of London under rampant capitalism. In Zanzibar, Marcella -- who, like her ancestors, has a head for business -- ran a prosperous ice cream stand. In London, she quickly makes a killing in real estate.
She also finds the love of her life, Benji, an Indian from Singapore who recognizes her at once as a kindred spirit. Not only is their skin the same color, they are, as he puts it, "both godless business Indians with Portuguese names, once displaced and twice removed." Benji is a wonderfully conceived character, the classic middleman, always optimistic, always on the run. ("Debt," he explains, "just proves people trust you.") The only book he owns is his Filofax. He does business out of his car and sleeps in half-built apartments. He has contacts everywhere. But ambition and ego lead him astray.
In the end -- the point is belabored a bit -- all the horrors of Zanzibar, from murder to corruption to terrorism, converge on London too. As we have known from the beginning of the novel, Marcella will go from a life of success to a prison cell, and she'll do it in a single day. Her friends and business associates, even Benji, vanish. She serves an eight-year sentence for a crime she did not commit.
Marcella is the author's mouthpiece, his stage manager, theorizing, summing up the action, signaling transitions, and at times these extra roles blur her outline. But the minor characters are just themselves, seen whole with tragic clarity. Kamara, a political refugee from Sierra Leone, a committed socialist, gradually becomes embroiled in the petty corruption of the government office that employs him. Monique, a beauty from Mauritius, drifts into a soul-destroying marriage with a a kind of modern slave trader. Even that Iraqi doctor, glimpsed now and then unloading a tray of pastries from his car, suggests a painfully reconstructed life.
There is no safe haven, this brilliantly prescient novel suggests, and nothing to hold onto. For better or worse, we are all migrants now.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/The Queensboro Bridge; 
Spanning the East River, With a Sense of Drama

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
THE Queensboro Bridge, begun in 1901, was one of New York City's most dramatic construction projects. Its vast steel frame is gradually cantilevered out from huge masonry piers across the East River, connecting Manhattan and Queens over Roosevelt -- then known as Blackwell's -- Island. 
 A project to clean and repair the bridge's six colossal stone piers, which were part of its lost network of pedestrian accommodations, is to begin next year. 
 The original plan used a bare-bones design, but after work started, a new commissioner of bridges, the engineer Gustav Lindenthal, hired the architect Henry Hornbostel in 1902 to create structural elements that would be more appropriate for a great public work. Usually, the magazine Architecture observed in 1903, "the engineer makes the design, hands it to the architect to add a lantern or two, makes it fancy, and the artistic conscience of the interested community is at rest." 
But in this case Hornbostel reworked the original, giving it elliptical entrance portals, Art Nouveau-influenced crowning finials and related ornamentation, as well as dome-topped masonry towers. Unlike the city's earlier suspension spans, the Brooklyn and Williamsburg Bridges, the new Blackwell's Island Bridge, as it was first called, was erected by cantilevering steel sections out from support towers on land. 
When Rudolph Knorr, a Cornish-born workman, put in the last rivet at 3:33 p.m. on March 19, 1908, a bottle of champagne was broken over the final beam. 
That September, Queens businessmen petitioned to have the name changed officially to the Queensboro Bridge. The New York Times wrote that influential property owners in Manhattan and Queens objected to the name Blackwell's Island Bridge because certain city buildings on Blackwell's Island made that name "unpleasantly suggestive of a penal institution and a poorhouse."
One businessman, E. J. Rickert, said: "It is distinctly a Queens Borough bridge, and is should have been so designated in the first place." The article did not discuss why the shorter form, Queensboro, was chosen.
But various Irish-American societies opposed the choice of Queensboro, which they thought sounded too British. Bernard McLaughlin, an original promoter of the bridge, said, "There is a deplorable fashion in this country of giving English names to American institutions." He added that the borough of Queens, not the bridge, needed a name change. He suggested "Montauk or some other good American name." 
According to Jeffrey Kroessler, president of the Queensborough Preservation League and author of "New York Year by Year: a Chronology of the Great Metropolis" (N.Y.U. Press, 2002), there is no evidence that Queens, named in 1683 when the province of New York was divided into 10 counties, was named for a particular queen. Some have argued, however, that the borough was named in honor of Catherine of Braganza, who was born in Portugal and married King Charles II of England in 1662.
The Queensboro name -- which had been in occasional use since 1899, before the bridge went up -- won out, and on March 30, 1909, the new $12 million span opened. There were 235 applications from people who sought to be the first to jump from the bridge -- 168 from professional bridge jumpers, 34 from inventors with devices to test, 9 would-be suicides and 24 unemployed men who thought the gesture would improve their chances of work.
They were all disappointed, because the hundreds watching from the roofs and windows of the tenements surrounding the bridge in Manhattan saw it open to a stampede of runners from athletic clubs, of whom the first was Alfred Lehnhardt, 18, of Manhattan and the Olivet Athletic Club. Among the first vehicles across was a farm wagon returning to Queens; a few hours earlier, it had carried produce into Manhattan on the 34th Street ferry. Far below, convicts in the penitentiary on Blackwell's Island pressed their faces to the barred windows of their cells. They had watched the 3,724 1/2-foot-long bridge grow, day by day. 
The bridge design provided for two decks, the upper with two outside footwalks and an interior double rail line to connect with the Second Avenue elevated, the lower with a vehicle roadway and four trolley tracks, including a special shuttle line that, in Manhattan, made a loop under the bridge's plaza on Second Avenue.
Hornbostel was proud of the spiky metalwork on top of the "gaily-capped" steel towers, as he described them in the magazine Architecture in 1909. Their fantastic, slightly sinister wavy shapes in riveted steel evoke Jules Verne's submarine the Nautilus in his book "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea." Traffic on each side of the bridge was disgorged without benefit of any formal plaza, although one of the 18-foot-high bronze lanterns designed by Hornbostel at the Manhattan end has somehow survived the continuous widenings made for increased auto traffic.
In July 1910 a letter in The Times signed "A Constant Reader" complained about a lack of benches for the "hundreds of children with their parents trying for air" on the stifling summer nights, an indication that the bridge was not solely used for vehicles. 
Indeed the two dome-topped anchorages housed elevators and stairs for pedestrians who needed access closer to the shorelines in Queens and Manhattan. A 1916 tally listed 705,000 pedestrians per year, as against 20 million rail passengers and 3.5 million vehicles. In 2000 the yearly tally was 289,000 pedestrians and cyclists, and 66 million vehicles. 
IN 1912 one prisoner tried to add to the pedestrian statistics. David D. Lewis, a clergyman, was at the Blackwell's Island penitentiary serving a one-year term for fraud. Slipping away from a work detail, he used a maintenance cable to clamber up to the bridge deck while under fire from prison guards below. 
But he was captured by two policemen on bicycles. The Times reported that friends of prisoners often dropped food and clothes from the bridge.
Because Manhattan-bound traffic arrived at Second Avenue without the benefit of a grand colonnade like that at the Williamsburg Bridge, a change was proposed in 1913: the demolition of the entire block between 59th and 60th Streets from Second to Third Avenue, and its replacement by a formal garden with temple-like structures camouflaging the elevated lines. But the plan was never realized. 
In 1931, Edward A. MacDougall, a prominent Queens real estate figure, called for another bridge crossing at 86th Street, saying that the saturation level for the Queensboro would be reached in 1937. But some room was made for increased vehicle traffic by adding a series of new approaches, north and south, and ending trolley and elevated service across the bridge. 
In 1960, eight elegant, 70-foot-high flagpoles, part of Hornbostel's design, were removed from the bridge's towers after years of inadequate maintenance. When flags flew from them, it must have been an inspiring sight, but The Times reported that the practice was discontinued after World War II -- it took several hours a day to raise and lower them. 
Now the Department of Transportation is planning a $3 million rehabilitation of the six massive piers in Manhattan and Queens. The project, designed by Walter B. Melvin Architects and Parsons Transportation Group, is to begin next year. In addition to cleaning and repairing the exterior stonework, the interior stairways will be rehabilitated; the elevators were removed long ago. 
A recent visitor walking up the stairs of the white-glazed-brick shaftway at 60th Street in Manhattan alarmed the pigeons who nest there, as well as a couple of friendly homeless men who live peacefully on a mezzanine near the top level, with the traffic roaring past. 
The open iron stairway makes for a giddy ascent, about seven floors high and protected only by light wire caging on one side. But the modern walker in the city will not soon experience it -- the work is being undertaken for the convenience of bridge workers, and the rehabilitated stairways will not be open to the public. 
The narrow bicycle/pedestrian lane on the north side of the bridge's lower deck is not nearly so elegant as the original pair of upper deck pedestrian walks. But even with the deafening traffic, it offers sweeping views to the north and south, with the swirling whorls of the East River far below, and the huge iron matrix of the bridge above.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
Bali Tightens Security To Win Back Tourists

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: Kuta, Indonesia 

 BODY:
The sweeping stretches of Bali's beaches sparkle in the sun, and in some places a few hardy tourists mingle with the local fishermen. But mostly, the popular playgrounds of young surfers and backpackers -- outdoor cafes, boutiques and nightclubs -- are virtually empty. 
 The hotels favored by a well-to-do clientele from Europe, the United States and Japan have become the exclusive clubs of some resilient regulars or a few determined honeymooners. In Ubud, the art community in the hills, the jewelry, furniture and clothing stores languish without customers. 
The emotional and economic toll of the Oct. 12 terrorist attack on a disco that killed more than 180 people, most of them tourists, has been tremendous. The mood on the island, known as an enclave of Hindu tranquillity, is strained by the prospects of a bleak economic future. 
 In the last 15 years, the surge in new hotels and shopping malls turned Bali into one of Indonesia's wealthiest areas, but it also made it overwhelmingly dependent on tourism. There are about 800 hotels, and a month after the blast, the occupancy rates in many places were in the single digits, with some managing 15 percent, according to the Bali tourism board, a government agency. Before the blast, occupancy had been about 70 percent. 
 To get tourism back, the major hotels have made some hard-headed decisions. The first, according to Brad Kirk, the general manager of the Bali Hyatt and the spokesman for the Casa Grande, an association of 44 four- and five-star hotels, was not to push for bookings right away. 
 "With the exception of the local market, we are telling our members: zero advertising and zero sales trips until January," Mr. Kirk said. "We think it looks heartless and mercenary to go into the marketplace now." 
 But more important, he said, the hotels wanted to develop what he called credible information about security on Bali. This information -- stressing new security measures at the major hotels -- has been circulated to all Indonesian embassies, foreign embassies in Jakarta and major tour operators, he said. 
 Immediately after the attack, hotels in the group beefed up security. Now, guards stop all vehicles entering the grounds of the 44 hotels, inspect the trunks and interiors of the vehicles and check the undercarriages. All of the five-star and most of the four-star hotels -- including the three Aman resorts, two Sheraton hotels, the two Hyatts, the two Four Seasons, the Ritz-Carlton and the Oberoi -- have gates, Mr. Kirk said. The association's hotels and others have uniformed, armed soldiers and police officers patrolling their properties. 
 At the Hyatt, four armed police officers and four armed soldiers patrol the 36 acres of gardens around the clock. In addition, four undercover military intelligence officers are on 24-hour duty, Mr. Kirk said. Some of the staff from underused divisions have been trained in security and now work as uniformed officers. 
 At the top and middle of the market, Mr. Kirk said, it was unlikely that hotels would cut rates. The problem for Bali, he said, was not the price of rooms but the perception of security. If the next two months are calm, the hoteliers will bring travel agents to Bali to show them that safety was being addressed, he said. 
 Midrange properties, which are particularly popular with Australian tourists, are also struggling. But they were heartened somewhat when the Australian government lifted a specific travel warning on Bali, though it kept a general warning about Indonesia. This followed the Japanese government's easing of its travel warning for Bali on Oct. 26. Other Asian countries, including Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea, have not issued travel warnings. 
 The Japanese Tour Operators Association, whose members visited Bali after the attack to see the new security measures, have begun promoting it again. This was an important boost because the Japanese -- with about 300,000 arrivals last year -- are the largest group of visitors. One of the demands of the Japanese -- more visible security at the Denpasar airport -- was taken care of by the Balinese government soon after the blast. Armed soldiers and police are now on the tarmac and in the terminal.
 The travel industry here is upset that the United States -- as well as Britain and Australia -- issued a stern travel warning for Indonesia after the attack. The State Department's public announcement says bluntly, "It is clear that U.S. citizens and U.S. interests in Indonesia are at risk." 
 But Bali is now safer than big resorts anywhere, hoteliers contend, arguing that terrorists don't strike the same place twice. American families who live in Jakarta continue to come here for weekends -- as do members of the American Embassy in Jakarta. 
 A big test will be the Christmas season. At the Oberoi, a resort of luxury villas among frangipani and bougainvillea on Legian Beach that has had few guests this month, reservations are coming in for Christmas, according to the general manager, Kamal K. Kaul. So far, there have been no cancellations for Christmas and New Year's.
 Meanwhile, the staff at the main hotels are being asked to take vacations, and those who remain on duty are doing maintenance or receiving extra training.
 Despite the downturn, hoteliers say Bali is resilient. "People love the Balinese," Mr. Kaul said. "I don't think Bali will be abandoned by those who have had a great time here."

HEADLINE: Agents' Survival Strategies 

BYLINE:  By BARRY ESTABROOK; BARRY ESTABROOK is a writer and editor who lives in Vermont.

 BODY:
WHEN reviewing her year-end accounts last January, Amy Powell, co-owner of All Ways Travel, realized that the agency she had operated profitably for 10 years from a Main Street storefront in Valdese, N.C., was in such dire financial straits that going out of business seemed to be inevitable. 
 Revenue was off by more than 20 percent from 2000 levels. Ms. Powell's credit line and overdraft protection were stretched to the limit. A major payment to the agency's bonding company was due in a few weeks or she would have to forfeit her accreditation to sell airline tickets. 
All Ways Travel was being assaulted from all sides. Internet travel service providers such as Expedia, Travelocity.com and Orbitz had eaten into Ms. Powell's business as clients, who used to walk into her plant-filled office to pick up tickets, got them by logging on. Facing a sour economy, her corporate customers spent less time on the road. Commissions from selling airline tickets, which once accounted for 60 percent of her revenue, had dwindled as airlines cut payments to travel agents. (Last March major airlines eliminated virtually all travel agents' commissions for tickets sold in the United States and Canada, although travel agents can still earn commissions by placing a sizable amount of business with a single airline.) The abrupt decline in travel after Sept. 11 administered what looked like the coup de grace. 
 "But bankruptcy wasn't an option for us," said Ms. Powell. "The company was supporting three families: mine, my partner's and the woman who works for us."
 So, with creditors looking over her shoulder, Ms. Powell began reshaping her business. Salaries were cut; hers by 75 percent. Expenses were trimmed. She made a concerted effort to encourage business clients to book their leisure travel through All Ways. And she began to increase service fees to customers.
 "If I'm going to do something for you, I'm not going to do it for free," said Ms. Powell. "Service fees are now in place for everything we do that doesn't yield a commission, whether it is selling an airline ticket, booking a rental car, or making a dinner reservation. We have to nickel-and-dime everyone to death."
 Virtually all members of the American Society of Travel Agents are now charging fees to clients for booking airline tickets, unheard of before 1995, according to William A. Maloney, executive vice president of the society. He said that the average charge was $20 to $25.
 To a greater or lesser extent, every travel agent in the country is facing the same challenges as Ms. Powell, and the industry is struggling to reinvent itself and redefine its role.
 "There is a sea change going on," said Mr. Maloney. "Travel agents for a long time had a monopoly on two things. One was information. They had the airlines' computers. The second thing was documents. If you wanted a ticket, you went to a travel agency. Now they have lost those monopolies. Information is plentiful, and tickets are irrelevant."
 The Airlines Reporting Corporation, which processes the sales of all airline tickets not bought directly through airlines, reported that sales were down by 13 percent for the first nine months of this year compared with the same period in 2001. 
 Another measure of the bad times in the industry is that membership in the American Society of Travel Agents has dropped to 20,000 from 27,000 three years ago, according to Mr. Maloney.
 One casualty was Bristol County Travel Agency in Bristol, R.I., operated for 35 years by Frederico Pacheco. When times were good, the agency had four employees and did about $2 million in business a year, which brought in commissions of $200,000, said Mr. Pacheco, who was a founding member of the Association of Professional Travel Agents.
 "I used to love the travel business. But the airlines cut the commission from 10 percent to 8 percent to 5 percent and then to zero," said Mr. Pacheco. "We tried to charge fees to our customers, but that didn't make up the difference." On April 1, realizing that he was dipping into his savings to keep the agency afloat and seeing no hope of an improved business climate in the future, Mr. Pacheco, who is 67 years old, closed his doors. 
 "The whole product is going through a transition," said Richard Eastman, a travel technology consultant in Newport Beach, Calif. "We are in a state of managing the unknowable, and it will probably take another five to 10 years before a new travel paradigm matures."
 Further change is also predicted by Jon Ash, managing director of the consulting firm Global Aviation Associates, who recently concluded a study for Orbitz, the online travel agency established jointly by United, American, Delta, Northwest and Continental airlines. Mr. Ash concluded that the number of travel agencies in the country, now approximately 24,000, which represents a drop from a high of 32,000 in the mid-1990's, could fall to 15,000 or 20,000 before the current shakeout was over.
 "The structural changes that are taking place in the industry are such that unless you are providing added value for which you can charge the client, you will go by the boards," said Mr. Ash.
 The drive to add value has led to a proliferation of agents who bill themselves as specialists in geographic areas or experts on specific leisure pursuits such as cruises, spa vacations, adventure travel, vegetarian travel and gay and lesbian travel.
 Established specialist agents have not been hit as hard as generalists by commission cuts and by the overall drop in travel. "Business is surprisingly good," said Mollie Fitzgerald, co-owner of Frontiers International Travel. The 34-year-old company, which has 83 employees in offices in Wexford, Pa., and London, derives 80 percent of its business from high-end clients who travel to fish or to shoot game birds. 
 "We feel fortunate that we are associated with specialty interests," said Ms. Fitzgerald. "People who are skittish about travel might defer the family holiday to Europe, but a guy isn't going to miss his annual fishing week in Iceland for love or money. People who are passionate about a sport or pursuit are much more likely to travel in this environment. We feel fortunate that we are not just selling airline tickets."
 Frontiers generates most of its revenue from commissions paid by the lodges and tour operators it represents. It charges customers a service fee of $35 for booking airline tickets on which no commission is paid.
 Some specialist agencies look upon the term "travel agent" as close to a dirty word and refuse to label themselves as such. "The public recognized that travel agents are doing something that can be duplicated on the Internet," said Richard Turen, managing director of Churchill and Turen, Ltd. "We are not a travel agency. We are vacation planning consultants."
 The company, which is based in Naperville, Ill., specializes in culinary vacations and tours. "It's been a very strong summer," said Mr. Turen. "I'm almost uncomfortable saying that we are busy."
 Business is also holding up at Virtuoso, a network of 265 agencies that focus on luxury travel for upscale clients. Matthew D. Upchurch, Virtuoso's chief executive officer, said that he expected that revenue generated by his member agencies this year would be 2 to 5 percent above last year's level.
 "Unfortunately, a lot of traditional travel agents are now trying to extricate themselves from being human vending machines for the airlines," he said. "We're really not so much in the travel business as we are in the life experience business."
 Mr. Upchurch said that most Virtuoso agencies charge their clients fees, but they are often "plan to go" fees that are written off against any commissions the agency receives from tour and cruise operators whose services the client books. Such commissions range from 8 to 15 percent of the cost of the package.
 Some segments of the traditional travel agency business remain strong. "Travel agents still represent 95 percent of the sales of all the cruise lines, 95 percent of the package tours from tour operators and over half of all the car rental days and hotel rooms in the United States, Mr. Maloney of the American Society of Travel Agents said.
 "Airlines would like you to believe that there are only two or three applicable fares between any pair of cities," Mr. Maloney said. "Nothing could be farther from the truth. Consumers need a guide through this jungle." 
 "In the short term you are going to have this chaos," he said. "But the underlying demand for travel during the next 10 years is phenomenal."
 Travel agents who have adapted to the new world are gradually becoming more optimistic. 
 On a Friday afternoon in mid-September, a small celebration took place at All Ways Travel. When she looked at her bank statement for August, Amy Powell saw that for the first time since she reorganized, there was a positive balance in the checking account. "I was dancing in the office," said Ms. Powell. "We could pay off our overdraft. Pay down our credit line. We even gave ourselves a small raise. You know, it's coming around."

HEADLINE: The Commuter Tax: Beyond the Knee-Jerk 

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
ADLINE WILSON takes two buses and then two subways every morning to get from her home in Uniondale to her job as a hospital clerk on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
 "You do it enough and you don't even think about it anymore," she said while rushing to catch a connection at the Hempstead bus terminal one recent evening. Her commute is two hours each way. 
 Mayor Michael M. Bloomberg's plan to impose a new income tax on commuters, on the other hand, definitely has given her something to think and complain about.
"It'll be a big bite out of my paycheck and I can't afford it," said Mrs. Wilson, who earns only about $30,000 a year and takes the bus because the train is more expensive. "It won't hurt the people on Wall Street. It's the little people like me who are going to feel it the most." 
Governor Pataki and the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, oppose the commuter tax plan, dooming it in its current form. Just in case, Long Island legislators have started collecting signatures from riders on the Long Island Rail Road as part of a campaign to make sure the State Legislature does not impose the mayor's plan on the 265,000 Long Islanders who work in New York City.
But officials and policy analysts have speculated that the Bloomberg proposal is a bargaining ploy intended to get state officials to approve a smaller, more defensible, commuter tax.
Mr. Bloomberg's proposal would extend the city's income tax to commuters, producing a tax that is roughly six times higher than the commuter tax that state officials eliminated with great fanfare three years ago. Under the proposed tax, a Long Islander who makes about $100,000 a year in New York City would pay about $2,100 a year, or about $9 a day -- a considerable sum when added to the cost of commuting.
While Mayor Bloomberg and his supporters argue that the debate should focus on how much in city services a commuter consumes, Long Island officials counter that commuters pour millions, if not billions, of dollars into the city's economy each year and that those contributions should not be ignored.
Fiscal experts are just as divided on the subject. Some say the proposed income tax would drive jobs out of the city and ultimately might hurt not just the city's economy, but that of the entire region. Others reason that some form of a commuter tax is justifiable, but say Mr. Bloomberg's plan to tax commuters and residents at the same rate is not.
While Mr. Bloomberg insists that "nothing could be fairer" than having commuters pay for their services, city officials have not produced any figures to show how much commuters actually cost the city in added services. But a study done by an economics professor at Hunter College, Howard Chernick, concludes that commuters cost the city between $1.2 billion and $1.9 billion a year in additional city services, or between $1,480 and $2,343 per commuter.
That would suggest that Mayor Bloomberg's proposal is not that unreasonable. But Dr. Chernick maintained that while his study shows that commuters do in fact cost the city money, they should not be expected to pay the same rate as residents since they do not consume the same level of services. He endorsed the reinstatement of the old commuter tax of 0.45 percent, which cost the commuter with a $100,000 salary about $400 a year. When revenues from a commuter tax like the previous one of 0.45 percent are added to the sales taxes paid by commuters for meals, shopping and services bought in the city, and the business taxes that employers already pay for each job, he said, the tax revenue estimate from each commuter job adds up to $2,253 -- a number that falls right within his commuter cost estimate. 
"It's justified on the grounds of equity and efficiency," Dr. Chernick said of the 0.45 percent commuter tax. "It's equitable because it taxes workers who tend to be higher-income people, and it's efficient because not having the tax gives commuters a free ride and makes it easier for people to take jobs in the city and move to the suburbs."
Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, said Mr. Bloomberg's proposed tax would hurt individual taxpayers and therefore "would be a significant drag on the Long Island economy because it would affect consumer spending."
Dr. Kamer said the proposed income tax "would negate the LIPA rebate and a whole lot of other things because it would erode the disposable income of Long Islanders." She was referring to the rebate and cut in electrical rates that Long Islanders received in 1998 when the Long Island Power Authority was created to replace the Long Island Lighting Company.
In the short run, she said, Long Island might benefit from the tax as some commuters might choose to leave their jobs in the city for ones on the Island and some businesses might move to the suburbs. But she said the tax ultimately could hurt the whole region. 
"The health of New York City's economy is essential to Long Island's economic health," she said. "But by the same token, New York City is dependent on the skills of Long Island residents and other suburbanites, and if the city loses those skills, it could lose that base. That base might shift to the suburbs, but we also run the risk that it might leave for other regions entirely."
James A. Parrott, the chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-backed research group, said, however, that as upset as many commuters may be by a tax, workers and their jobs were unlikely to head for the suburbs. The institute studied the economic relationship of suburb to city and found that between 1991 and 1998, Long Island had become more dependent on the city for jobs.
In Nassau County, commuter wages of $8.6 billion in 1991 accounted for 49 percent of total wages earned by county residents. By 1998, the figure had grown to $12.7 billion, or 56 percent. Suffolk County's reliance was lower, but also grew from $3.1 billion or 22 percent of total wages to $4.6 billion or 23 percent.
"The importance of commuter wages to the suburban economy grew substantially in the 1990's," he said, noting that the shift was due in part to Long Island's loss of some 50,000 jobs in the aerospace and defense industries in the late 1980's and early 1990's.
Mr. Parrott also pointed out that commuters tend to work at higher-paying jobs, particularly in the financial sector, which accounts for a remarkable 76 percent rise in total commuter wages between 1991 and 1998, going from $35.9 billion to $63.1 billion. Total wages for city residents, by contrast, increased by only 40 percent.
"A commuter tax is not going to result in droves of people quitting their city jobs," he said. "In this economy, in recession with no upturn in sight? You've got to be kidding."
But even if the jobs and the commuters stay where they are, the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, has argued against the commuter tax on the grounds that the city should not pit city against suburb. Both the city and Nassau County have been hurt by the slowing economy and by the need to shoulder increased Medicaid burdens, and Mr. Suozzi's spokesman, Bruce Nyman, argued that together they should push for a change in the Medicaid funding system.
"The answer isn't a commuter tax or a Long Island tax," Mr. Nyman said. "There needs to be a statewide answer for the problems of the city, Nassau County, Westchester and all the other local municipalities."
Unlike New Jersey officials who have called for new taxes on commuters to their state, Mr. Suozzi opposes any retaliatory tax on the tens of thousands of city residents who commute to Long Island. "What's next then, setting up moats and gates?" Mr. Nyman said. "We need to work together."
E. J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy research center, agreed that commuters should not be subject to any commuter tax, mainly because the city already heavily taxes employers in the form of business income taxes and commercial rent tax. "All those taxes are designed to tap into the stream of wealth generated by workers," he said. "So businesses already are paying many times over for the services their people are consuming."
Mr. McMahon also said that commuters use very few city services, mainly just those of the police and fire departments. Large portions of the city budget are dedicated to the school system and welfare programs, which do not benefit commuters at all, he added.
But Dr. Chernick said commuters benefit indirectly from maintaining the city's quality of life, including services to the poor. "Things like traffic, environmental protection and sanitation, these are all services that make the city an orderly place and that's consumed by everybody who comes here," he said.
Mr. McMahon also contended that commuters already pay for their share of city services through their huge contribution to the city's economy and the sales taxes generated from their spending. He estimated that commuters easily pour several billion dollars into the city each year and calculated that even with a daily expenditure of about $5 a day, the city's 800,000 commuters would easily spend more than $1 billion. "And that's not taking into account the special occasions, dinner and theater or season tickets to the Rangers," he said. "Commuters do a lot of these things because they're already here, and a lot of that would vanish if they were back in Mineola or White Plains."
Edward Shannon, who commutes to Lower Manhattan from Garden City for his job as a money broker, said he sees the city at large "as kind of like an extended office for me." He has breakfast meetings around town, rides the subway to get around and buys all kinds of supplies for home and office while he's there.
A few years ago, he might have taken a tougher position against the commuter tax, he said, but watching the city suffer through Sept. 11 and its aftermath has changed his perspective somewhat.
"Do I want to pay a commuter tax? Absolutely not," he said. "But I understand the mayor's got to get the money from somewhere and if he a needs a few dollars, I don't have a problem with it."

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
The Commuter Tax Debate

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
AS soon as Janet Morgan heard about Mayor Michael M. Bloomberg's plan to impose a new income tax of up to 2.7 percent on commuters, she did the math to figure out what it would cost her. The results weren't pretty.
 The figures "are kind of crazy," said Ms. Morgan, who commutes to New York City from Dobbs Ferry where she lives as a single mother with three children, who will all be in private school next year. "What I might pay in New York City income tax is what it costs to send my son to Catholic school," she said. Finding money to pay the commuter tax and the proposed 28.6 percent property tax increase for Westchester "will be very difficult for me," she said. 
 Elected officials from Westchester and other suburban communities have zealously joined the debate on behalf of Ms. Morgan and the more than 103,000 other Westchester residents who make the trek to New York City for the sake of a job. Westchester County Executive Andrew J. Spano said Mr. Bloomberg's plan was misguided and warned, "We don't want to start a border war." New Jersey legislators have gone even further and threatened to devise retaliatory taxes on commuters to New Jersey. 
While Mayor Bloomberg and his supporters argue that the debate should focus on how much in city services a commuter consumes, Westchester officials counter that commuters pour millions, if not billions, of dollars into the city's economy each year and that those contributions should not be ignored.
Fiscal experts are just as divided on the subject. Some say that the proposed income tax would drive jobs out of the city and ultimately might hurt not just the city's economy, but that of the entire region. Others reason that some form of a commuter tax is justifiable, but say that Mr. Bloomberg's plan to tax commuters and residents at the same rate is not. Officials and policy analysts have speculated that the proposal is a bargaining ploy, designed to get state officials to approve a smaller, more defensible, commuter tax.
The mayor's proposal would extend the city's income tax to commuters, a tax that would be roughly six times higher than the commuter tax that state officials eliminated with great fanfare three years ago. Under the proposed tax, an average commuter, who makes about $100,000 a year, would pay about $2,100 a year, or about $9 a day.
While Mr. Bloomberg insists that "nothing could be fairer" than having commuters pay for city services, city officials have not produced any figures to show how much commuters actually cost the city in added services. But a 2001 study by an economics professor at Hunter College, Dr. Howard Chernick, concludes that commuters cost the city between $1.2 billion and $1.9 billion a year in additional services, or between $1,480 and $2,343 per commuter. 
That would suggest that Mr. Bloomberg's proposal is not that unreasonable. But Dr. Chernick maintained that while his study shows that commuters do in fact cost the city money, they should not be expected to pay the same rate as residents since they do not consume the same level of services. He endorsed the reinstatement of the old commuter tax of .45 percent, which cost the average commuter with a $100,000 salary about $400 a year. When revenues from a commuter tax like the previous one of .45 percent are added to the business taxes that employers already pay for each job, he said, the tax revenue estimate from each commuter job adds up to $2,253 -- a number that falls within his commuter cost estimate. 
Marsha Gordon, the president of the Westchester Chamber of Commerce, said, however, that Westchester does not tax the 50,000 people who commute from the city to Westchester. "So to tax Westchester residents who commute into the city is unfair," she said. "It does not help the causes of either quality of life or inter-regional cooperation."
Mr. Spano agreed and said that if the proposed tax thinned the ranks of commuters to the city and resulted in companies looking elsewhere to relocate, he would not want to see Westchester gain at the city's expense. "Getting business from the city is never good under any circumstance," he said. "We're partners." 
James A. Parrott, the chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-backed research group, said that as upset as many commuters may be by a commuter tax, workers and their jobs were unlikely to head for the suburbs. The institute studied the economic relationship of suburb to city and found that between 1991 and 1998, the last year of the tax, Westchester had become much more dependent on the city for jobs.
Commuter wages in Westchester grew to $11.1 billion in 1998, or 65 percent of total wages earned by county residents, from $5.8 billion in 1991, or roughly 45 percent of total wages. "The importance of commuter wages to the suburban economy grew substantially in the 1990's," he said, noting that the shift in Westchester was due in part to downsizing in the mid-1990's, which led to high office vacancy rates in the county.
Mr. Parrott also said that commuters tend to work at higher paying jobs, particularly in the financial sector, which accounts for a remarkable 76 percent increase in total commuter wages between 1991 and 1998, going to $63.1 billion from $35.9 billion. Total wages for city residents, by contrast, increased by only 40 percent.
"A commuter tax is not going to result in droves of people quitting their city jobs," he said. "In this economy, with no upturn in sight? You've got to be kidding."
BUT even if the jobs and the commuters stay where they are, Mr. Spano argued against the commuter tax, saying it would wrongly pit city against suburb. Both the city and Westchester have been hurt by the slowing economy and by the need to shoulder increased Medicaid burdens and other state-mandated programs. "The state is putting too much of a load on the city and counties," he said. "It's an Albany tax problem, not a Bloomberg tax problem and not a Spano tax problem."
E. J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy group, agreed that commuters should not be subject to any income tax, mainly because the city already heavily taxes businesses in the form of business income taxes and commercial rent tax. "All those taxes are designed to tap into the stream of wealth generated by workers," he said. "So businesses already are paying many times over for the services its people are consuming."
He also said that commuters use very few city services, mainly just those of the police and fire departments. Large portions of the city budget are dedicated to the school system and welfare programs, which do not benefit commuters, he said.
But Dr. Chernick reasoned that maintaining the city's quality of life through services to the poor and through the general administration of the city benefits commuters indirectly. "Things like traffic, environmental protection and sanitation, these are all services that make the city an orderly place and that's consumed by everybody who comes here," he said.
Mr. McMahon also contended that commuters already pay for their share of city services through their huge contribution to the city's economy and the sales tax generated from their spending. He estimated that even with a daily expenditure of about $5 a day, the city's 800,000 commuters would easily spend more than $1 billion. "And that's not taking into account the special occasions, dinner and theater or season tickets to the Rangers," he said. "Commuters do a lot of these things because they're already here and a lot of that would vanish if they were back in Mineola or White Plains."
Still, there are some commuters like Eric Sweeting, from Hastings-on-Hudson, who believe that the new tax actually makes sense.
"I think it's fair," said Mr. Sweeting, who works for a social service agency in the city. "When they repealed the commuter tax, I thought it was irresponsible. If suburban commuters make their living in the city and bring their paychecks back out, it's just not unreasonable to ask them to pay."
He for one doesn't buy into the prediction that the tax will drive people out of the city. "That's the first thing that rolls off people's tongues, but the fear is exaggerated," he said. "There's not a municipality in America that doesn't face a tax increase."

HEADLINE: Top Picks: Mazda, VW, Honda, Nissan 

 BODY:
 After evaluating nine midsize sedans, contributors to these pages picked their favorites, least favorites and what they found most surprising. Here is what they said:

James G. Cobb, editor of the Automobiles pages for The New York Times:

PICK -- I drove the Mazda6 500 miles to Ohio, then made a 10-hour dash to upstate New York. After all that time at the wheel I had no complaints, which is rarely the case, though I'd have preferred the optional V-6 to the just-adequate 4 in the test car. I like the Mazda's style, its suspension and even its seats, controls and stereo. It's a good car, and with more power it could be a great one.

PAN -- The Optima looks good on paper, and it dazzles you with a lot of features for its price. But when you drive it back to back with the competition, you quickly realize that the Kia's chassis, transmission and overall refinement don't yet measure up.

SURPRISE -- Under its homely skin, the Impala has great bones, with an eager engine, a capable suspension and decent handling. The Chevy felt bigger, plusher and more substantial than some of the other cars. To my surprise, I preferred it to the mushy Camry.

Cheryl Jensen, a Cleveland freelance writer who often writes for these pages:

PICK -- The Mazda6 is not just entertaining to drive, it has room for a four-member family and more trunk space than the Accord, my third choice. It is more nimble than the Passat, my second choice, probably because it is more than 200 pounds lighter, and the body motions are more tightly controlled.

PAN -- The Taurus is proof that Ford is putting its resources into sport utilities.

SURPRISE -- The Mazda6 steers and handles better than the Passat. It's the most fun I'd had in a Mazda since the Miata.

Michelle Krebs, a Detroit area auto writer whose car reviews have appeared in these pages since 1994:

PICK -- I'm tired of boring interiors. The Mazda6 has a beautiful cabin inside its attractive skin. The car has spirit, too. Mazda engineers have magically made a front-drive family car feel like a rear-drive sport sedan.

PAN -- The company saved by the Taurus has invested no money to keep the car fresh. Ford executives say Americans want S.U.V.'s, not cars, but if they built a great midsize family sedan, people might buy it.

MOST SUPRISING -- The Impala performed better than I expected. Too bad it is so ugly.

Bob Knoll, who retired in 1997 after 32 years as Consumer Reports' auto testing director and is now a Connecticut freelancer:

PICK -- Although the Passat was my top-scoring car by a close margin, largely because of its well-balanced chassis, the car I would buy is the Altima. In my judgment, it is the best-rounded, because it combines contemporary styling inside and out with a roomy and useful body. The rather large four-cylinder engine responds well, works well with the automatic transmission and delivers fuel economy on par with the other four-cylinders'. The Altima handles crisply, responds well and is fun to drive. To top it off, it was the least expensive car in the test.

PAN -- One looks at the Optima and sees a V-6 engine, leather seats and bells and whistles. One does not see the clumsy, heavy handling or the mediocre ride. The Kia's V-6 should outpower the 4's in this group, but it feels weak, and the transmission has trouble matching the engine's requirements. This car needs a lot of development to catch the others, and it needs to lose 300 pounds.

SURPRISE -- The Camry's ride and handling were disappointing on secondary roads --roads that the three domestic sedans handled with aplomb. The Camry feels too much like an older American car, especially compared with the crisp-handling Passat, Mazda6, Altima and Accord.

Dan Lienert, a New York City freelance writer who graduated from Harvard University this year:

PICK -- The Accord isn't as cheap as the Camry and it doesn't look as nice as the Passat, but thanks to a great ride, the most sophisticated interior and a sleek body design, the Accord seems the most comfortable with itself. After all these years, it should.

PAN -- The Intrepid swims in vague steering and throttle responses and gets relatively poor gas mileage. It looks bloated from behind. Its cabin lacks storage compartments, and there's no escaping the plastic interior.

SURPRISE -- The elder statesman from Detroit, the Taurus, has fossilized, but the Accord looks fresher than ever -- fresher, indeed, than anything else out there.

Keith Martin, editor and publisher of Sports Car Market magazine in Portland, Ore., who writes about sports and collector cars for The Times:

PICK -- The Mazda6 was unremarkable, even somewhat underpowered, on the freeway. But when driven aggressively, its drivetrain, suspension and ergonomics came together to make it easily the best all-round car in the group.

PAN -- With Olds fading out, perhaps the Camry can stand in as a squishy-handling replacement. You used to expect Toyotas to feel crisp, but the Camry has turned into a wallowing, pseudo-American sedan.

SURPRISE -- I didn't like the Passat unless I was thrashing it to within an inch of its mechanical life. At that point, its Teutonic solidity and composure put it at a different performance level than the other cars.

Mark Phelan, a Michigan writer (who recently joined The Detroit Free Press):

PICK -- The Passat's small engine struggled to power a car of its size, but other virtues overcame that shortcoming. The Passat has a gorgeous interior, styling that has aged well, crisp steering and excellent handling. The cabin is a little cramped, but the VW we tested was a lot of car for $23,725.

PAN -- The first-generation Taurus redefined the American sedan and saved the Ford Motor Company. It is a shame that Ford has allowed the Taurus to age so gracelessly.

SURPRISE -- Who'd have thought that the Intrepid, a car destined for replacement within a year, would hold up so well in such tough competition? The styling is still fresh, though I could do without the test car's rear spoiler. The V-6 has plenty of power, and the handling was amazingly fluid for such a large car. On the other hand, the interior was among the worst, with big gaps, poor materials and prehistoric switches.

HEADLINE: Itching to Rebuild the Tax Law 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
TAX experts from universities and research institutes have trooped into Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill's spacious office for months now. Some come to feed his passion for overhauling the tax code, others to temper it. Some come bearing specific plans for achieving his ambitious goal, others with advice based on long experience in the political trenches, where the idea of making the tax code simpler, fairer and more economically efficient is as perilous as it is alluring.
 In the next month or two, Mr. O'Neill is expected to distill the thinking of outside economists and his staff, along with the strong personal views on the tax code's flaws that he developed as chief executive of Alcoa, into prototypes for entirely remaking the tax system and for substantially simplifying it. Those options, in turn, will guide President Bush as he decides whether and how to take on what would be one of the most ambitious projects of his presidency and a possible centerpiece of his 2004 re-election campaign platform. 
 If the administration moves ahead -- all indications suggest that it will proceed cautiously -- it will be opening the door to a furious ideological battle, inflamed by interest groups. 
The ensuing debate would focus on fundamental issues like whether the wealthy should pay taxes at higher rates than lower-income people. It would challenge the practice of using the tax code to encourage certain types of behavior and to discourage others. It would test the administration's commitment to help big business at a time when corporate scandals have made it politically tricky to do so.
It would also threaten -- or promise -- to undo the tangled mass of tax breaks won by lobbyists over the decades for particular industries, companies and individuals. And it would present immense practical obstacles, not least finding a way to shift from one system to another without unduly disrupting a $10 trillion-a-year economy.
"This is the ultimate Washington insiders-versus-America issue," said Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee that supports changing the tax system. "Washington derives so much of its power from the tax code -- not just congressmen on the Ways and Means Committee, but lobbyists and lawyers. You're taking on the whole Washington establishment, from real estate to municipal bond traders to accounting firms, charitable groups and so on down the line. It becomes a battle royal."
The tax agenda is already crowded. Mr. Bush is pushing hard for Congress to make permanent the 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut enacted last year. He may also propose new tax cuts early next year intended to lift the economy in the short run, steps like reducing the taxes paid on stock dividends, giving companies tax breaks on investment in equipment and accelerating the personal income tax cuts passed last year.
BUT Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic policy adviser, said in a speech this month that before they are put forward, even those measures will be assessed to see if they would be consistent with the goal of rethinking the tax code. 
The last tax overhaul took place in 1986. After two years of debate and intense behind-the-scenes deal making, the Reagan administration and Congress settled on a bipartisan package that cut rates and simplified the code a bit in return for eliminating some tax breaks. 
But that effort was modest compared with what will be on the table this time.
Since the mid-1980's, the closest thing to a national discussion of a new tax system came in 1996, when Steve Forbes made a single-rate flat tax the centerpiece of his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination. When his campaign fizzled, the issue all but disappeared.
The administration has not yet decided how to present the issue to voters this time around. After promising this fall to deliver his ideas to Mr. Bush after the election, Mr. O'Neill has gone silent on the topic, and Treasury officials said there was no timetable for completing the study. White House officials have been studying various proposals on their own.
Proponents of change, most but not all of whom are on the right, say the present tax code hurts the economy. They say it imposes huge costs on individuals and businesses as they fill out forms, keep their books and deal with legal and financial issues; discourages savings and investment; and encourages companies and individuals to shelter income in sometimes questionable or illegal ways.
"Our tax code is an abomination, and it hurts our competitiveness," Mr. O'Neill said in a speech to a business group this summer. "This nation deserves a better tax code, and I believe we can achieve it." 
Behind most of the proposals is a basic philosophy: shifting from a system of taxing income to one that taxes consumption -- another way of saying that savings and investment should be exempt from taxes. In theory, promoting more savings and investment by eliminating taxation of capital gains and dividends, for example, would make the economy more productive in the long run. It would increase the pool of capital available for research, new technologies, more efficient factories and better educated and trained workers.
The changes would also address longstanding complaints among businesses and individuals that the tax code is too complex and the Internal Revenue Service too intrusive and intimidating.
Mr. O'Neill talks mainly about the corporate income tax, which raises about 10 percent of the $2 trillion in federal revenue each year. He has long derided it as a barrier to international competitiveness and rational business decision making.
Much more political attention would no doubt be paid to individual income taxes, which raise about $1 trillion a year at the federal level.
Most of the possible changes assume that the goal is neither to reduce the government's overall tax receipts nor to increase them. One approach would tax households at a flat single rate, estimated to be as low as 18 percent and as high as 33 percent. Another would replace the income tax with a national sales tax, probably at least 23 percent; a variant would be a European-style value-added tax levied at every point in the distribution chain. Another strategy would retain progressive multiple rates for individuals but replace the corporate income tax with a value-added tax.
Critics of change fall into two camps. Some object to specific proposals that would harm their interests. The idea of eliminating the mortgage interest deduction, for example, has drawn fire from the housing industry and homeowners. Getting rid of the child credit would no doubt provoke a backlash from families and from social conservatives who have championed its expansion.
More generally, many liberals say that recent tax-overhaul proposals are thinly disguised efforts to benefit the wealthy at the expense of the poor and the middle class. They note that nearly all the proposals move away from the progressive tax system, which taxes higher incomes at higher rates, and toward systems that ultimately cut taxes for wealthy people more than for anyone else. Not only would income tax rates come down for big earners, but most proposals would also eliminate other taxes paid largely by the wealthy, like the capital gains tax, long a target of Republicans.
Conservatives "believe, or have been influenced to believe, that light taxes on the wealthy, or no taxes on the wealthy, are the key to prosperity," said Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research organization.
Some Democrats, like Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, a likely presidential candidate in 2004, think that the issue, properly framed, could be a winner for their party. But even if the left-right differences over the need for a new system could be resolved, advocates of fundamental change differ sharply over what it should look like.
Advocates of a national sales tax say that only their proposal would eliminate the need for the Internal Revenue Service. Flat-tax advocates say their proposal is much more workable and can be made fairer to low-income people than can a sales tax.
With Republicans now in control of both the House and the Senate, and Mr. Bush, a proponent of change, in the White House, the stars are better aligned to put the issue at center stage. But even the most enthusiastic advocates of change say it will not be easy, especially if industries that perceive themselves as losers mount aggressive lobbying efforts.
"It's going to take an enormous investment of political capital on the part of the president to build grass-roots support," said Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee for six years before retiring from Congress two years ago.
WITH Mr. Bush confronting the likelihood of a war with Iraq, the continued threat of terrorist attacks and a soft economy, tax reform is not his highest priority. Lobbyists and economists in Washington assume that he will raise the issue in his State of the Union address in January, then spend a year or two promoting the principle without backing a specific proposal or pushing for legislative action.
"I don't see this as an immediate issue," said R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, who favors changing the system. "The president obviously has very many things on his mind at the moment." 
But in an effort to push the effort forward, Mr. O'Neill has been canvassing leading tax thinkers like Joel B. Slemrod of the University of Michigan, David F. Bradford of Princeton, Michael J. Graetz of Yale, Ronald A. Pearlman of Georgetown and Alan J. Auerbach of the University of California at Berkeley.
The best-known approach is the flat tax, which has had prominent champions like Mr. Forbes and Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the Republican majority leader who is retiring from Congress.
In its purest form, the flat tax would look much like a single-rate income tax, at least to individuals. But it would actually be a tax on consumption, because it would exclude savings and investment. 
It would meld a value-added tax on business to a flat tax at the same rate on individual wage and pension income. Other types of income, like capital gains, dividends and interest, would be exempt from taxation.
But because the rate must be at least 20 percent, and probably higher, to raise the same revenue as the current tax system, it would amount to a tax increase for many people now subject only to the 10 and 15 percent rates. So most flat-tax proposals include a large exemption that would push many households off the tax rolls entirely. Mr. Armey's plan, for example, proposed a $35,000 exemption for a family of four.
Other tax proposals apply some of the flat tax's principles. Mr. Bradford's "X-tax," for one, would levy multiple rates on individuals and a value-added tax on businesses.
Mr. Graetz has developed a plan that would place a value-added tax on businesses and consumers and use the revenue to cut the corporate income tax as well as remove all households with incomes below $100,000 from the individual tax rolls.
The option least likely to be adopted by the administration is a national sales tax, a bigger version of the retail tax already levied by 45 states.
THE best known sales-tax proposal is one promoted by Leo E. Linbeck Jr., a wealthy Texas construction executive. His plan, which he calls the Fair Tax, would replace both the income tax and the payroll taxes that go to Social Security and Medicare. It says a revenue-neutral sales tax would be 23 percent.
Other economists said that the actual figure would need to be at least 30 percent and that a sales tax of those levels would lead to a thriving underground economy as buyers sought to avoid the tax.
Moreover, critics say, the burden would fall hardest on low-income people who spend everything they earn. The proposal would try to get around the problem of fairness by rebating taxes on purchases up to an amount equal to the poverty line.
If complete code revision is impossible, Congress and the administration are all but certain to address a few pressing problems in the current system. 
The biggest looming issue is the alternative minimum tax. It was created to ensure that high-income taxpayers would not be able to escape taxation by sheltering their income. But the income thresholds at which it kicks in are not indexed for inflation, and more and more middle-class taxpayers become subject to it every year, requiring them to make complex calculations and pay a higher tax than under the regular income tax.
A study this year by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, found that the number of taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax would swell to 36 million by the end of the decade from several million this year.
Both parties see that as a ticking time bomb. But eliminating the problem would be expensive, perhaps prohibitively so; estimates run into the hundreds of billions of dollars in the next decade.
The administration has also signaled that it is intent on simplifying the current tax code if it cannot replace it. Citing an example of what he has often called the tax system's monstrous complexity, Mr. O'Neill noted earlier this year that there are five different definitions of "child" in the tax code; cutting it to one, he suggested, would be a good place to start a broader effort at simplification.

(Stephen Crowley/The New York Times)(pg. 11) Drawing (Christophe Vorlet)(pg. 1) Chart: "Rethinking the Code"Here are some proposed changes to the United States tax system. FLAT TAX -- A single-rate tax for individuals, on income minus savings and investment. A value-added tax at the same rate on business transactions other than capital investment. Most plans have a rate in the low 20 percent range. PROPONENTS' ARGUMENTSPromotes saving and investing.Makes filing much easier.Could be revised to set multiple rates for individuals to retain the progressive nature of the tax system.Spurs economic activity by reducing top marginal rates. OPPONENTS' ARGUMENTSIs a tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of lower-income people.Requires difficult trade-offs between a low rate and longstanding tax breaks like the mortgage interest deduction. NATIONAL SALES TAX -- A sales tax, like those already imposed by most states, on all purchases of goods and services. The leading plan, called the Fair Tax by its proponents, envisions a rate of 23 percent. PROPONENTS' ARGUMENTSEliminates the need for personal and corporate income taxes, withholding of wages and separate payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare.Ends the need to file returns and maintain the Internal Revenue Service.Ends taxation of savings and investment. OPPONENTS' ARGUMENTSHelps the wealthy more than lower-income people, who spend nearly everything they earn.Encourages tax evasion.Presents difficult tradeoffs between keeping a low rate and exempting purchases of essentials like food, medicine and housing. SMALLER REFORMS -- Would focus on the most pressing problems in the tax code, including the alternative minimum tax and the corporate alternative minimum tax. Might create a new tax system for multinational corporations. PROPONENTS' ARGUMENTSWould be much easier to assemble bipartisan political support and avoid a lobbying campaign against it by interest groups.Would avoid costly and wrenching transitions to a new system. OPPONENTS' ARGUMENTSCould involve costly changes without any offsetting tax increases.Would not fully address issues like disincentives to saving and investment.Might make the tax code more complex.

HEADLINE: Washington Insider, But Wall St. Pariah 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
BY almost any measure, Charles R. Schwab should be a hero on Wall Street. He made himself a billionaire a few times over by starting a brokerage firm and building it into a financial powerhouse whose low-priced Internet trading service helped fuel the boom of the late 1990's.
 This year, as disillusioned investors fled the market, it was Mr. Schwab who planted ideas with President Bush that might bring them back. At least among politicians in Washington, he is receiving credit for proposals to reduce taxes on dividends and to increase the allowable deductions for investment losses, measures that have taken root with some Republican lawmakers and that may well blossom into breaks for investors next year. 
 But despite his impressive resume and close connection to the Bush administration, Mr. Schwab is less popular than ever among his peers. He may be even more disliked on Wall Street than Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general of New York, who has vilified investment bankers, stock analysts and the executives who employ them. 
Some senior executives of other brokerage firms cannot contain their rage at the mere mention of Mr. Schwab's name. His repeated denouncements of the conflicts of interest at other big brokerage firms and his more-ethical-than-thou pronouncements have fanned the flames. When the microphones are turned off, top officials of competing firms call Mr. Schwab's behavior "disingenuous" at best, "parasitic" at worst.
If Mr. Schwab, 65, were to retire now -- he said last week that he had no intention of quitting anytime soon -- he might be remembered most by his competitors not for his accomplishments but for a single phrase: "Let's put some lipstick on this pig."
An actor portraying a Wall Street manager uttered that line in a television commercial that Schwab started broadcasting last spring; the manager was exhorting brokers to sell a weak stock to unsuspecting investors. The ad appeared just as Mr. Spitzer was making hash of Merrill Lynch's reputation by releasing embarrassing e-mail messages written by some of the firm's analysts. One of the messages referred to a recommended stock as a "dog."
Schwab, which does not underwrite stocks, stopped using that commercial last month, but the anger it generated persists.
"It was, frankly, a cheap shot," said James P. Gorman, who runs Merrill Lynch's brokerage operation. "There's a basic principle that you don't kick somebody when they're down. They violated that principle and they're getting a lot of heat over it."
The unique dual role Mr. Schwab plays -- a Mr. Inside-Mr. Outside of the financial world -- has placed him squarely in the spotlight as lawmakers and regulators struggle to find ways to rebuild faith in the American financial markets. But there is a subplot: Mr. Schwab's stature as a guru of democratic markets may have risen, but his stock as a visionary manager of his own company has sunk.
THOUGH not tainted by the conflicts of interest plaguing its competitors that own investment banks, the Charles Schwab Corporation is in financial distress. Even after its third round of companywide layoffs, Schwab reported a net loss of $4 million last quarter, when most big securities firms were able to squeeze profits out of the depressed financial markets. Last week, one analyst downgraded the company's shares, saying they were worth about 30 percent less than their current price of $11.70 because its prospects were "lackluster."
Some Wall Street executives have dismissed Mr. Schwab's criticism of them as the lashings of a competitor whose bull-market business model, largely dependent on individual investors, is failing in a prolonged slump. But in an interview in his office in San Francisco last week, Mr. Schwab said the outbursts aimed at him were misdirected.
"If they took the same energy and put it into the correction process, we'd be a lot further ahead today than being in denial," he said. "To this moment, I don't know of any grand mea culpa by our industry to say we've made a mistake, a bunch of mistakes, and we're now going to clean them all up and go forward so you can feel confident coming back and doing business with us." 
In letters this fall to President Bush and Harvey L. Pitt, the departing chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Schwab proposed a code of conduct for the top executives of financial services companies. He recommended that they be required to certify periodically that conflicts of interest had not motivated their employees to put the interests of corporate clients ahead of those of individual customers.
Mr. Pitt praised Mr. Schwab this month in a speech before Wall Street executives at their annual convention in Boca Raton, Fla. Speaking for the first time since announcing his resignation three days before, Mr. Pitt said Mr. Schwab had "laid out some thoughtful proposals." He mentioned no other industry officials.
John H. Schaefer, who preceded Mr. Pitt on the podium that morning, had trouble suppressing some less-charitable views, however. 
Mr. Schaefer, president of Morgan Stanley's Individual Investor Group, had written a speech that included a few shots at Mr. Schwab and his company -- "Enough is enough, Chuck" was one. But his advisers convinced him that those remarks would be inappropriate for an audience that included Schwab executives. Still, minutes before Mr. Schaefer stepped to the lectern, he reinserted one of those cracks and handed the revised text to the teleprompter operator. 
In his speech, Mr. Schaefer said investors were "at a time of intense dissatisfaction that will not quickly disappear," then added that he thought "commercials like 'Let's put lipstick on these pigs' " did more harm than good for efforts to restore investor confidence.
Mr. Schwab said last week that the ad that riled his rivals was not his favorite and that he would offer an apology to brokerage executives if they expressed their feelings to him. But Mr. Schwab, never one to mix socially with his peers on Wall Street, did not seem chastened.
And why should he? In mid-August, at a conference on the economy in Waco, Tex., President Bush sat next to Mr. Schwab, who ticked off ideas about how the government could help to restore investor confidence. Mr. Schwab proposed increasing the amount of investment losses that people can deduct from their taxable annual income, to $20,000 from $3,000, and ending the "double taxation" of dividends that companies pay to shareholders. He also took a swipe at his competitors on Wall Street, calling for "a crackdown on the conflicts that have left investors so distrustful of Wall Street brokers and banks."
None of Mr. Schwab's ideas are altogether original or revolutionary. Economists and financial executives have proposed similar changes for years. But Mr. Schwab's timing and sense of opportunity were excellent.
THE White House had invited him to speak not only because he was a generous contributor to Mr. Bush's campaign and a frequent contributor to the Republican Party, but also because he was an investor spokesman who was not seen as a Wall Street insider, Republican aides and campaign advisers said. In the midst of all the investigations into the behavior of investment bankers and analysts, one adviser said, "Wall Street is considered toxic."
Mr. Schwab, who has given more than $750,000 to Republican campaign committees and candidates since 1998, said that when he spoke in Waco, he did not know if there was political support for changing taxation of dividends. He said he simply thought companies should be encouraged to pay out more of their profits to shareholders and to spend less time and money trying to prop up or inflate their share prices.
"I just thought it was a fundamental idea that would really enhance investor confidence and reward long-term investing by getting some return on your investment," he recounted, sitting at the end of a conference table here, on the 30th floor of the company's modest headquarters in the financial district. Serious to a fault, he looked grayer and sounded less optimistic than he does in commercials.
THE Bush administration did not rush to embrace all of what Democrats on Capitol Hill call "the Charles Schwab proposals," but some of his suggestions have caught on. In October, the House Ways and Means Committee drafted a bill that would raise the capital-loss limit, but to $8,250, not the $20,000 that Mr. Schwab had proposed. That bill did not move through the House this year, but it could be revived when Congress convenes again in January.
Last week, Senator Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican who is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, proposed a list of tax cuts that included increasing the capital-loss provision to $10,000 and eliminating what he called the double taxation on dividends. Some Republican strategists said they thought that there was momentum behind those ideas, though Democratic staff members in Washington dismissed them as beneficial only to wealthy people and unlikely to stimulate economic activity or even stock purchases.
Any initiatives that would spur investors to buy or sell more stock should be a boon to Mr. Schwab's business and to his own portfolio. He still owns 18 percent of his company, though the value of his stake has dropped as the share price has fallen 75 percent from its high of $50 in 1999. He ranked 59th on Forbes magazine's latest list of the wealthiest Americans, with an estimated net worth of $2.7 billion.
Since his appearance in Waco, Mr. Schwab has been mentioned as a possible future Treasury secretary. But he denies having any interest in going to Washington. Extricating himself from a company named after him and so closely identified with him would be tricky, and any nomination of him would probably be opposed by some Wall Street firms.
But leaving now would spare him the difficult task of reinventing his company again. Schwab is trying to shift from catering only to investors who feel capable of making their own decisions to also providing advice to those who need it. That switch puts Schwab in more direct competition with Wall Street giants like Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and UBS that employ armies of financial advisers. Those competitors contend that Mr. Schwab's recent attacks on them are motivated by self-interest.
"They're good competitors, but to try to pull down the advisory model at the time when you're trying to get into it is seen as self-serving," said Mr. Gorman of Merrill Lynch, the only Wall Street executive interviewed who would speak about Mr. Schwab for attribution. "It's the pattern and the presumption that the financial adviser is not acting in the client's best interest, which is what is insulting."
Other Wall Street executives, irritated by Mr. Schwab's stinging barbs, point fingers at what they consider the Schwab company's own conflicts of interest. Most often, they criticize the way Schwab directs more than one-third of its customers' trades to an in-house unit that makes markets in stocks, a practice known as internalizing orders. By doing that, Schwab keeps more of the trading profit for itself instead of seeking the best price for its customers, the critics contend.
Mr. Schwab rebutted the charge, saying he did not think his company was shortchanging its customers. But he said that if Schwab had to divest itself of its market-making business to make the rest of the industry swear off conflicts of interest, it would be willing to do so.
Henry McVey, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said he thought such practices might become an issue again next year, after Wall Street moves past the furor over how stock analysts behaved and how new stocks were sold during the boom of the late 1990's.
But Schwab is making so little money from its capital markets unit these days that investors would hardly miss it if the company did exit the business. Schwab took in just $47 million from what it calls principal transactions last quarter, down 80 percent from $245 million in the first quarter of 2000. All told, Schwab's revenue last year was $4.35 billion, and its profits were $267 million.
Schwab "has a good business model but it's not without flaws," said Mr. McVey, who raised his rating on Schwab's stock two weeks ago to "equal weight" from "underweight."
"Fundamentally, I think the Schwab model is about empowerment of the consumer and, in general, lower pricing," he said. On at least one point, he disagrees with Mr. Schwab's detractors on Wall Street. "The man's integrity runs deep," he said.

HEADLINE: The World; 
Of the People, By the Warlords

BYLINE:  By TOM ZELLER 

 BODY:
IN his 2001 book "Taliban," Ahmed Rashid writes of "bloodstains and pieces of flesh" in the muddy courtyard of Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, a Soviet-trained commander with a tight grip on several northern provinces in Afghanistan. 
 "I innocently asked the guard if a goat had been slaughtered," Mr. Rashid writes. "They told me that an hour earlier Dostum had punished a soldier for stealing." 
 Mr. Dostum is now Afghanistan's deputy defense minister. He is also considered by many to be the country's warlord par excellence, with thousands of troops and a reputation for frontier justice -- not unlike dozens of other such strongmen, from Kunduz to Kandahar.
Indeed, in the vacuum following the Taliban's defeat, many regional leaders who had, to varying degrees, cooperated with American forces (and with one another), became de facto kings of their respective slices of Afghanistan. Last June, several were tactfully folded into the fledgling government of President Hamid Karzai, turning warlords into provincial governors and strongmen into cabinet ministers.
It was a necessary move, and it followed the same logic that led American forces, in the early days of the Afghan war, to cooperate with -- and according to recent revelations, pay large sums of money to -- some decidedly unsavory characters: better they be allies than enemies.
Now, to extend his control from a few hundred square miles around Kabul to the 250,000 square miles and 25 million fractious inhabitants of Afghanistan, Mr. Karzai is trying to take the war out of the warlords.
"They're going to need incentives," said Barnett R. Rubin, senior fellow at New York University's Center on International Cooperation. "That means decommissioned soldiers will need jobs, a livelihood. And the warlords will need some form of legitimate power."
Building an economy from scratch is one thing. It's quite another to undo the loose system of regional strongmen -- one that has existed in varying degrees through much of Afghanistan's recent history, often with the nurturing of various foreign patrons.
Although many of the most powerful militia leaders have been placated with official government posts, the country is peppered with petty warlords who refuse to fall into line. 
Where they control roads, they finance themselves and their small armies with customs duties and tolls. Where they control villages, they charge taxes. 
In some cases, they have breathed new life into the opium trade, which the Taliban had cracked down on.
Even the newly knighted regional leaders come with baggage that may prove too heavy for the Karzai government to bear. One of them, Ismail Khan, the principal warlord in the west and governor of Herat Province, has been accused of ordering the torture of political enemies. Upside-down hanging, whipping and shocking with electrical wires attached to the toes and thumbs are reported to be among the favored techniques. But Mr. Dostum has the fiercest reputation. The United Nations is currently investigating charges that his troops killed up to 1,000 captured Taliban prisoners last winter by piling them into airless shipping containers.
STILL, the way of the warlord need not be the future of Afghan politics.
"I would not say that warlordism is a permanent attribute of Afghan society," said Dr. Antonio Giustozzi, author of "War, Politics and Society in Afghanistan, 1978-1992," "but rather it has been a recurrent feature, due to some geographical and social conditions that make it difficult to build a strong state there."
It is also true that the emerging Afghan government is not wholly made up of muscle. There are academics and former politicians with experience predating the Taliban and the Soviet occupation in the 1980's. 
Some warlords, too, have shown a proclivity toward broad-minded cooperation. Wide swaths of northeastern Afghanistan, for example, have been relatively calm. And Mr. Karzai's firing of more than 15 top officials earlier this month appeared to send a message that warlords need to get with the program. 
It's possible that the message will be lost on some. 
"I will never feel hurt if I am called a fighter," Mr. Dostum is quoted as saying in The Christian Science Monitor last June. "But if I am called a warlord, it hurts me."

GRAPHIC: Chart/Photos: "Afghanistan's Power Brokers"When the Taliban was overthrown a year ago, local Afghani warlords stepped into the vacuum. Some have since won positions in Hamid Karzai's government. Many continue to clash -- sometimes violently -- with one another, with dozens of lesser warlords and power-hungry thugs, and with the forces in Kabul seeking to establish centralized control. Here is a look at some influential regional players and their current status. Abdul Rashid DostumAtta MuhammadNORTH CENTRAL -- An ethnic Uzbek, Soviet-trained general and now deputy defense minister, Mr. Dostum has a reputation for ruthlessness. His forces are thought to have killed hundreds of Taliban prisoners last winter, and it was reported last weekend that Mr. Dostum may have jailed and tortured witnesses to the crime. He is also struggling for control of the north with a powerful rival (and former ally) Atta Muhammad, whose troops now control Mazar-i-Sharif. Ismail KhanWEST -- During the war with the Soviets, Mr. Khan was a storied resistance leader. He spent much of the Taliban years in jail, but quickly became the Northern Alliance's man in the west last November. Today he is the governor of Herat Province and the subject of a scathing report this month by the group Human Rights Watch, which suggests that Mr. Khan and his troops include torture, beatings and harassment in their politicking. Gul Agha ShirzaiSOUTHWEST -- Mr. Shirzai was governor of Kandahar from 1992 to 1994 before going into exile in Pakistan. He returned last December and has resumed his governorship. An attempt was made to assassinate him, along with Mr. Karzai, in September. Mr. Shirzai has a reputation for avoiding abuses as governor and working closely with rival warlords -- or, some reports suggest, buying their allegiance with foreign aid money. Karim KhaliliCENTRAL -- The head of one of Afghanistan's largest political parties, Mr. Khalili is less a warlord than a politician with several minor warlords among his followers -- most of them in the central provinces where the Taliban destroyed two giant Buddhas last year. Mr. Khalili became one of several vice presidents in June and has been, on at least one occasion, designated acting head of state when Mr. Karzai was out of the country. Daoud KhanNORTHEAST -- A Tajik and former Northern Alliance commander, Mr. Khan and his largely Tajik troops were quick to disarm Taliban sympathizers and establish firm control of the region. Mr. Khan and company are followers of former president Burhannuddin Rabbani, who is now often at odds with the new defense minister, Muhammad Fahim. International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), Hamid Karzai and Gen. Muhammad Fahim KABUL AND ENVIRONS -- President Karzai (right top) enjoys a security zone around Kabul established by ISAF, a multinational security force created after the Taliban were driven out. Requests to expand the force outside Kabul have thus far been unfulfilled. Defense Minister Fahim's followers have helped to establish control further out of Kabul and in the strategic city of Jalalabad, but the border regions east and south of the capital city remain fragmented by several petty warlords vying for power.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE ALLIES; 
Bush Appeals To New Allies On Iraq Plans

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
President Bush extended a welcome to two future NATO partners today, saying that their experience of Communist tyranny equipped them to understand the dangers posed by Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
 Speaking before a crowd of tens of thousands here in Romania's capital, Mr. Bush said that because they had seen "the face of evil" in their former ruler, Nicolae Ceausescu, "the people of Romania know that dictators must never be appeased or ignored. They must be opposed." 
 Earlier in the day, Mr. Bush delivered a similar message in Vilnius, Lithuania, as the first American president to visit the Baltic country. This week, at a summit meeting in Prague, NATO invited Lithuania, Romania and five other former Communist states to join the military alliance originally established as a shield against the Soviet Union.
As a steady rain fell over Bucharest, Mr. Bush spoke in the city's Revolution Square directly across from the old Communist Party headquarters where, in 1989, a helicopter lifted Mr. Ceausescu off the roof as a mob surged through its doors trying to kill him. Three days later, Mr. Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed by a firing squad.
"You value freedom, because you have lived without it," said Mr. Bush, his face drenched with rain. "You know the difference between good and evil, because you have seen the face of evil."
An "aggressive dictator," Mr. Bush said, "now rules in Iraq. By his search for terrible weapons, by his ties to terrorist groups, the dictator of Iraq threatens the security of every free nation, including the free nations of Europe."
The speech was one of the few that Mr. Bush has made to such a large crowd outdoors since the Sept. 11 attacks, and he addressed the gathering behind a screen of bulletproof glass. Sharpshooters were stationed atop buildings throughout the square.
The speech echoed one Mr. Bush made earlier today in Lithuania.
Before a much smaller crowd in City Hall Square in Vilnius, Mr. Bush compared the threat from today's terrorists to the Nazis and Communists who controlled much of Europe for parts of the 20th century. Like the Nazis and the Communists, Mr. Bush said, "the terrorists seek to end lives and control all life." 
Mr. Bush told the Lithuanians that "we must be willing to stand in the face of evil, to have the courage to always face danger."
"The people of the Baltic states have shown these qualities to the world," Mr. Bush said. "You have known cruel oppression and withstood it. You were held captive by an empire and you outlived it."
The president's two stops today, the last leg of a five-day trip to the NATO meeting in Prague and a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in St. Petersburg, were another extension of his campaign to seek support for military action against Iraq.
Romania in particular is of strategic importance to that campaign because its ports on the Black Sea are a link to the Middle East, and could supply bases from Turkey to the Persian Gulf that are used by American and British forces. Although the country appeared an unlikely candidate a little more than a year ago -- it is still struggling with corruption and the transition to a market economy -- that changed after the Sept. 11 attacks.
"NATO membership will make Romania more secure," Mr. Bush said. "And Romania will add to the strength of the NATO alliance as we face unprecedented new dangers. Already, our troops are serving side by side in Afghanistan. Already, Romania has joined the global coalition against terror."
Mr. Bush's words also offered Mr. Putin reassurance that Russia had nothing to fear from NATO's expansion. "In the peaceful future we're building, Romania will strengthen our lives in another way -- as a bridge to a new Russia," Mr. Bush said. "For centuries, Romania's geography was a source of danger. Now, you can help our alliance to extend a hand of cooperation across the Black Sea."
Russia, Mr. Bush said, has nothing to fear from the growth of NATO because Russia needs peaceful, stable neighbors like Romania. "As I told President Putin yesterday, a Russia that is fully part of Europe needs no buffer zone separating it from Europe," he said. "America and Romania are friends to the Russian people, and so is the NATO alliance."
Although Mr. Bush praised Romania for choosing free markets over state control and democracy over dictatorship, he said the nation had to work harder toward change.
"NATO's invitation to join was also a vote of confidence that you will continue the hard work of political, economic and military reform," Mr. Bush said. "Your hardship did not end with your oppression."
The president also paid a tribute to those Romanians who had lost their lives in one of the bloodiest rebellions that swept Communism from Eastern Europe more than a decade ago.
"On this historic square, among the monuments to Romania's greatness, there's also a building left in ruins -- the former offices of the secret police," Mr. Bush said.
"It is a fitting reminder of all the cruelties done there, and the justice that rose up against oppression," he said. "That grim monument also recalls the many brave Romanians who did not live to see this day."
In both Bucharest and Vilnius, Mr. Bush promised the new allies that by joining NATO, an attack on one member of the alliance would be considered an attack on all.
"Our alliance has made a solemn pledge of protection, and anyone who would choose Lithuania as an enemy has also made an enemy of the United States of America," Mr. Bush said to applause in Vilnius. "In the face of aggression, the brave people of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia will never stand alone again."
Mr. Bush's appearance outside the Vilnius City Hall was a powerful and poignant sight for Lithuanians, and would have been an unthinkable moment for most of the past 60 years. From its annexation by the Soviet Union in 1940 into the early 1990's the nation was occupied by either the Nazis or the Communists. The United States refused to recognize its annexation and maintained that position up until the country achieved independence in 1991. 
He appeared on stage in Vilnius with Lithuania's president, Valdas Adamkus, as well as the leaders of the two other Baltic states, President Vaira Vike-Freiberga of Latvia and President Arnold Ruutel of Estonia.
In Bucharest, he appeared with President Ion Iliescu, who told Mr. Bush in a ceremony at the Cotroceni Palace here that "we have understood the concern of the American partners regarding phenomena such as corruption and bureaucracy."

HEADLINE: Suburbs to City: Drop the Attitude; 
Reminding Bloomberg That He Needs Commuters Just as They Need New York

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
To: Michael R. Bloomberg and his eight million constituents 
From: James E. McGreevey, John G. Rowland, George E. Pataki, Thomas R. Suozzi, Andrew J. Spano and the rest of the metropolitan region's, oh, 11 million or 12 million people

Dear Mike:
 We need to talk about our relationship. Let's face it, we're all a bit stressed these days. Our budgets are under pressure, your budget is under pressure. In some places we know we've got to take another hit, i.e., some sort of an M.T.A. fare increase. In others, we're not so sure, i.e. your over-the-top commuter-tax proposal. But sometimes stress leads to reflection. This is one of those times. 
 You're saying that you want more of our money because we need you, you made us who we are. We're not unappreciative of the importance of New York City to all of us little people elsewhere. But we'd like to argue that we're more independent than you give us credit for, and that the relationship is far more nuanced and less one-sided than you may think. And this is a good time to try to figure out in what ways we need one another and in what ways you need us more than we need you.
So let's look at reality, and not just reputation, shall we?
Back when the commuter tax was first introduced in 1966, we were quite dependent on you because you offered the best, highest-paying jobs, and all the transportation networks flowed into the city. Whenever New York City sneezed, the rest of us caught a bad cold, and we recuperated far more slowly. But when you took a hit of unparalleled proportions last year, we helped you, a lot. 
Look at how we worked so well after Sept. 11 with your recovery, cleanup and security. We suburbanites rallied behind your musicals and your museums, taking up the slack left by many of the too-timid tourists. Through good times and bad, in fact, we have provided a steady 25 to 30 percent of the total Broadway audience over the last 20 years, according to the president of Audience Research and Analysis, George Wachtel.
Indeed, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, James W. Hughes, said that we even "restrained" ourselves and were not "overly aggressive in taking advantage of New York City's misfortune" after Sept. 11. In plain talk, we didn't court your companies and your residents. (If they came to us, well, hey, that was a different story.)
Still, you've got to acknowledge that our suburban appeal is potent: in recent years, we've been quite successful in nurturing small businesses in cutting-edge fields like information technology and biotechnology. We have become more "recession-resistant" and have built a kind of "fire wall" between the suburbs and the city, according to Marc Goloven, senior regional economist at J. P. Morgan Chase.
That maturation helped cushion the suburbs from the double whammy that you suffered at the hands of the recent economic downturn, as well as the terror attacks, says Thomas J. Spitznas, a regional economist in Mount Vernon, N.Y. We have become less vulnerable, more diversified.
Many counties have kept their unemployment rates low, with little change, Mr. Goloven notes. Long Island's 3.7 percent, for instance, is the same as it was in October 2001. New York City, by contrast, has 7.8 percent unemployment, compared with 6.8 percent a year ago.
Over in New Jersey, Mr. Hughes points out that 80 percent of all the office space in the Garden State was built during the 1980's or later. And while New Jersey had only 1.7 million jobs in 1950, compared with 3.4 million for New York City, the comparable figures for 2000, he says, are 4 million jobs for New Jersey, versus 3.7 million for New York City.
Now, we're not disputing the notion that, as Mr. Goloven puts it, "the rising income tide of New York City tends to lift all the boats in the surrounding counties." Hence the impressive statistic, from New York City's Independent Budget Office, that the average commuter working in the city earned $99,400 in 1998. The average city resident's take? $33,700.
We're also not suggesting, necessarily, that we can prosper in the long run if you continue to stumble. Much as we tout our smashing successes in tourism, self-sufficiency, culture and whatnot, stereotypes die hard.
New York City "is still the engine of the regional economy, if nothing else but attitudinally," Mr. Goloven says. "You're not going to look at Westchester County and say, because they're doing O.K., everybody is doing O.K. You have to have New York City help to pull the rest of the train."
Still, Mark Zandi, the chief economist of the Economy.com Web site, says that more New York City residents are moving to the suburbs than suburbanites are moving in. Mr. Zandi also says that the amount of income earned by suburban commuters, which peaked at $22.1 billion in 2000, is expected to drop to $17.1 billion this year.
"New York is different from nearly every American city in that the core is central to its economic success, but I think it's fair to say that this is changing," he says. "It is becoming more like the rest of the country."
Forget about it, you might say. But some researchers go so far as to wonder why, aside from entertainment and cultural events, people really need to be in Manhattan, with its clogged traffic and exorbitant prices. Maybe only those who share the elitist, Manhattan-centric vision of the artist Saul Steinberg need face-to-face contact, says Joel Garreau, who wrote "Edge City: Life on the New Frontier" in 1991.
"Lunch is it," he says. "Otherwise, why bother?"
Now, many respected scholars, like Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University (and an adviser of yours), and Fred Treyz, chief executive officer of Regional Economic Models Inc. of Amherst, Mass., take issue with some of our cheerleading.
Professor Moss, who has written about the rivalry between New York and New Jersey, notes that New York's vibrant economy has fueled booming housing markets in Larchmont, N.Y., Montclair, N.J., and other affluent addresses. And Dr. Treyz, like Professor Moss, says he adamantly believes that labor -- the diversity of the work force, and the access to that work force -- gives New York City (and the region) a huge competitive edge over the rest of the country.
We also cannot overlook the reality that your city has successfully marketed itself as the Center of the Universe. Prof. Saskia Sassen, a sociologist who is the author of "The Global City" says that the "glamour of Manhattan" creates a "sticky web" that is crucial to attracting foreign firms and international clients.
And it is a unique glamour, Dr. Moss contends.
"The suburban communities are basically interchangeable with any suburban communities in America, like Winnetka or Shaker Heights; the only thing that varies is the foliage," he says. "But there's only one New York City."
If there is one thing you take from this letter, though, Mike, it is that we should really be fighting these economic doldrums together. Talk to us before you unveil something like the commuter tax. You need us: remember, only 33 percent of Yankee fans and 39 percent of Met fans who go to the games live in New York City, according to a 1998 study by the city's Independent Budget Office.
We should be teammates, and equal (or near-equal) partners thinking of creative solutions. Myron Orfield, president of Ameregis, a research and geographic information systems firm in Minneapolis that has analyzed tax data for numerous metropolitan areas, says that revenue sharing is a far superior alternative to a commuter tax. It has worked in Boston and Minneapolis, for instance, to the betterment of both cities and their suburbs.
Of course, since we are professional politicians, and you are not, we understand how tough things must be for you right now. After all, New Jersey wanted to impose a commuter tax on Pennsylvania earlier this year. But no one liked that idea, either.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ALLIANCES; 
In North Korea and Pakistan, Deep Roots of Nuclear Barter

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
Last July, American intelligence agencies tracked a Pakistani cargo aircraft as it landed at a North Korean airfield and took on a secret payload: ballistic missile parts, the chief export of North Korea's military.
 The shipment was brazen enough, in full view of American spy satellites. But intelligence officials who described the incident say even the mode of transport seemed a subtle slap at Washington: the Pakistani plane was an American-built C-130. 
 It was part of the military force that President Pervez Musharraf had told President Bush last year would be devoted to hunting down the terrorists of Al Qaeda, one reason the administration was hailing its new cooperation with a country that only a year before it had labeled a rogue state.
But several times since that new alliance was cemented, American intelligence agencies watched silently as Pakistan's air fleet conducted a deadly barter with North Korea. In transactions intelligence agencies are still unraveling, the North provided General Musharraf with missile parts he needs to build a nuclear arsenal capable of reaching every strategic site in India. 
In a perfect marriage of interests, Pakistan provided the North with many of the designs for gas centrifuges and much of the machinery it needs to make highly enriched uranium for the country's latest nuclear weapons project, one intended to put at risk South Korea, Japan and 100,000 American troops in Northeast Asia.
The Central Intelligence Agency told members of Congress this week that North Korea's uranium enrichment program, which it discovered only this summer, will produce enough material to produce weapons in two to three years. Previously it has estimated that North Korea probably extracted enough plutonium from a nuclear reactor to build one or two weapons, until that program was halted in 1994 in a confrontation with the United States.
Yet the C.I.A. report -- at least the unclassified version -- made no mention of how one of the world's poorest and most isolated nations put together its new, complex uranium project.
In interviews over the past three weeks, officials and experts in Washington, Pakistan and here in the capital of South Korea described a relationship between North Korea and Pakistan that now appears much deeper and more dangerous than the United States and its Asian allies first suspected.
The accounts raise disturbing questions about the nature of the uneasy American alliance with General Musharraf's government. The officials and experts described how, even after Mr. Musharraf sided with the United States in ousting the Taliban and hunting down Qaeda leaders, Pakistan's secretive A. Q. Khan Nuclear Research Laboratories continued its murky relationship with the North Korean military. It was a partnership linking an insecure Islamic nation and a failing Communist one, each in need of the other's expertise.
Pakistan was desperate to counter India's superior military force, but encountered years of American-imposed sanctions, so it turned to North Korea. For its part, North Korea, increasingly cut off from Russia and China, tried to replicate Pakistan's success in developing nuclear weapons based on uranium, one of the few commodities that North Korea has in plentiful supply.
Yet while the United States has put tremendous diplomatic pressure on North Korea in the past two months to abandon the project, and has cut off oil supplies to the country, it has never publicly discussed the role of Pakistan or other nations in supplying that effort.
American and South Korean officials, when speaking anonymously, say the reason is obvious: the Bush administration has determined that Pakistan's cooperation in the search for Al Qaeda is so critical -- especially with new evidence suggesting that Osama bin Laden is still alive, perhaps on Pakistani soil.
So far, the White House has ignored federal statutes that require President Bush to impose stiff economic penalties on any country involved in nuclear proliferation or, alternatively, to issue a public waiver of those penalties in the interest of national security. Mr. Bush last year removed penalties that were imposed on Pakistan after it set off a series of nuclear tests in 1998.
White House officials would not comment on the record for this article, saying that discussing Pakistan's role could compromise classified intelligence. Instead, they noted that General Musharraf, after first denying Pakistani involvement in North Korea's nuclear effort, has assured Secretary of State Colin L. Powell that no such trade will occur in the future. 
"He said, 'Four hundred percent assurance that there is no such interchange taking place now,' " Secretary Powell said in a briefing late last month. Pressed about Pakistan's contributions to the nuclear program that North Korea admitted to last month, Secretary Powell smiled tightly and said, "We didn't talk about the past."
A State Department spokesman, Philip Reeker, said, "We are aware of the allegations" about Pakistan, though he would not comment on the substance. "This adminsitration will abide by the law," he said.
Intelligence officials say they have seen no evidence of exchanges since Washington protested the July missile shipment. Even in that incident, they cannot determine if the C-130 that picked up missile parts in North Korea brought nuclear-related goods to North Korea.
But American and Asian officials are far from certain that Pakistan has cut off the relationship, or even whether General Musharraf is in control of the transactions.
Yet in the words of one American official who has reviewed the intelligence, North Korea's drive in the past year to begin full-scale enrichment of uranium uses technology that "has 'Made in Pakistan' stamped all over it." They doubt that North Korea will end its effort even if Pakistan cuts off its supplies. 
"In Kim Jong Il's view, what's the difference between North Korea and Iraq?" asked one senior American official with long experience dealing with North Korea. "Saddam doesn't have one, and look what's happening to him."

A Meeting of Minds in 1993
Pakistan's military ties to North Korea go back to the 1970's. But they took a decisive turn in 1993, just as the United States was forcing the North to open up its huge nuclear reactor facilities at Yongbyon. Yongbyon was clearly a factory for producing bomb-grade plutonium from spent nuclear fuel. 
When North Korea refused to allow in inspectors headed by Hans Blix, the man now leading the inspections in Iraq, President Bill Clinton went to the United Nations to press penalties and the Pentagon drew up contingency plans for a strike against the plant in case North Korea removed the fuel rods to begin making bomb-grade plutonium.
In the midst of that face-off, Benazir Bhutto, then the prime minister of Pakistan, arrived in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. It was the end of December, freezing cold, and yet the North Korean government arranged for tens of thousands of the city's well-trained citizens to greet her on the streets. At a state dinner, Ms. Bhutto complained about the American penalties imposed on her country and North Korea.
"Pakistan is committed to nuclear nonproliferation," she said, according to a transcript issued at the time. However, she added, states still have "their right to acquire and develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, geared to their economic and social developments."
Ms. Bhutto's delegation left with plans for North Korea's Nodong missile, according to former and current Pakistani officials. 
The Pakistani military had long coveted the plans, and by April 1998, it successfully tested a version of the Nodong, renamed the Ghauri. Its flight range of about 1,000 miles put much of India within reach of Pakistan's nuclear warheads.
A former senior Pakistani official recalled in an interview that the Bhutto government planned to pay North Korea "from the invisible account" for covert programs. But events intervened.
Months after Ms. Bhutto's visit, the Clinton administration and North Korea reached a deal that froze all nuclear activity at Yongbyon, where international inspectors still live year-round.
In return, the United States and its allies promised North Korea a steady flow of fuel oil and the eventual delivery of two proliferation-resistant nuclear reactors to produce electric power. That was important in a country so lacking in power that, from satellite images taken at night, it appears like a black hole compared to the blazing lights of South Korea. 
But within three years, Kim Jong Il grew disenchanted with the accord and feared that the nuclear power plants would never be delivered. He never allowed the International Atomic Energy Agency to begin the wide-ranging inspections required before the critical parts of the plants could be delivered. 
By 1997 or 1998, American intelligence has now concluded, he was searching for an alternative way to build a bomb, without detection. He found part of the answer in Pakistan, which along with Iran, Libya, Yemen, Syria and Egypt was now a regular customer for North Korean missile parts, American military officials said. 
A. Q. Khan, the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb, who had years ago stolen the engineering plans for gas centrifuges from the Netherlands, visited North Korea several times. The visits were always cloaked in secrecy.
But several things are now clear. Pakistan was running out of hard currency to pay the North Koreans, who were in worse shape. North Korea feared that without a nuclear weapon it would eventually be absorbed by the economic might of the South, or squeezed by the military might of the United States.
In 1997 or 1998, Kim Jong Il and his generals decided to begin a development project for a bomb based on highly enriched uranium, a slow and difficult process, but relatively easy to hide.

Talking, but Not Changing
They did so even while sporadically pursuing a better relationship with Washington. In the last days of the Clinton administration, the North negotiated with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright for a deal to restrict North Korean missile exports in return for a removal of economic penalties, a de-listing from the State Department's account of countries that sponsor terrorism and talks about diplomatic recognition. The deal was never reached.
President Clinton even considered an end-of-term trip to North Korea, but was talked out of it by aides who feared that the North was not ready to make real concessions. The nuclear revelations of the past few weeks suggest those aides saved Mr. Clinton from embarrassment.
"Lamentably, North Korea never really changed," said one senior Western official here with long experience in the topic. "They came to the conclusion that the nuclear card was their one ace in the hole, and they couldn't give it up."
American intelligence agencies, meanwhile, suspected that North Korea was restarting a secret program. In 1998, satellites were focused on a huge underground site where the C.I.A. believed Kim Jong Il was trying to build a second plutonium-reprocessing center. But they were looking in the wrong place: after American officials negotiated access to the suspect site, they found only a series of man-made caves with no nuclear-related equipment, and no apparent purpose. "World's largest underground parking lot," one American intelligence official joked at the time.
Rumors of a secret enriched-uranium project persisted, however. The C.I.A. and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee evaluated the evidence but reached no firm conclusion.
But there were hints. One Western diplomat who visited North Korea in May 1998, just as world attention focused on Pakistan, which had responded to India's underground nuclear tests by setting off six of its own, recalled witnessing an odd celebration. "I was in the Foreign Ministry," the official recalled last week. "About 10 minutes into our meeting, the North Korean diplomat we were seeing broke into a big smile and pointed with pride to these tests. They were all elated.
"Here was a model of a poor state getting away with developing a nuclear weapon." 
When the Clinton administration raised the rumors of a Pakistan-North Korea link with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who succeeded Ms. Bhutto, he denied them. It was only after General Musharraf overthrew Mr. Sharif's government, and after Mr. Bush took office, that South Korean intelligence agencies picked up strong evidence that North Korea was buying components for an enriched-uranium program.
The agencies passed the evidence along to Washington, according to South Korean and American officials. It looked suspiciously similar to the gas centrifuge technology used in Pakistan. "My guess is that Pakistan was the only available partner," said Lee Hong Koo, a former South Korean prime minister and unification minister. 
A. H. Nayya, a physics professor at Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad, who has no role in the country's nuclear program, agreed: "The clearest possibility is that the Pakistanis gave them the blueprint. 'Here it is. You make it on your own.' " 
Under American pressure, Dr. Khan was removed from the operational side of the Pakistani nuclear program. He was made an "adviser to the president" on nuclear technology.
Here in Seoul, nuclear experts working for the government of President Kim Dae Jung say they were subtly discouraged from publicly writing or speculating about the North's secret programs because the Korean government feared that it would derail President Kim's legacy: the "sunshine policy" of engagement with North Korea and encouraging investment there.
By this summer, however, the C.I.A. concluded that the North had moved from research to production. The intelligence agency took the evidence to Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, who asked for a review by all American intelligence agencies.
Such a request is usually a prescription for conflicting interpretations. Instead, the agencies came back with a unanimous opinion: the North Korean program was well under way, and had to be stopped.

Telling the North, 'You're Busted'
After sending senior officials to Japan and South Korea in August to present the new evidence, Mr. Bush decided to confront the North Koreans. On Oct. 4, James A. Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, was in North Korea and told his counterparts that the United States had detailed information about the enriched-uranium program. 
"We wanted to make it clear to them that they were busted," a senior administration official said. 
The North Koreans initially denied the accusation, but the next day, after what they told the American visitors was an all-night discussion, they admitted that they were pursuing the secret weapons program, several officials said. "We need nuclear weapons," Kang Sok Joo, the North Korean senior foreign policy official, said, arguing that the program was a result of the Bush administration's hostility.
Mr. Kelly responded that the program began at least four years ago, when Mr. Bush was governor of Texas. The Americans left after one North Korean official declared that dialogue on the subject was worthless and said, "We will meet sword with sword." 
Since then, the North Koreans have been more circumspect. They have talked publicly about having the right to a nuclear weapon, even though they have signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and an agreement with South Korea to keep the Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons. 
The Bush administration has been uncharacteristically restrained. President Bush led the push for an oil cutoff, but also issued a statement on Nov. 15 saying that the United States had no intention of invading North Korea. His aides hoped that the statement would give Kim Jong Il the kind of security guarantee he had long demanded -- and a face-saving way to end the nuclear program. 
Mr. Bush's aides say the way to deal with North Korea, in contrast to their approach to Iraq, is to exploit its economic vulnerabilities and offer carrots, essentially the strategy the Clinton administration used. Many here in Seoul believe it may work this time.
"The North Koreans are a lot more dependent on us, and on the West, than they were in the 1994 nuclear crisis," said Han Sung Joo, who served as South Korea's foreign minister then. 
But the reality, officials acknowledged, is that Mr. Bush has little choice but to pursue a diplomatic solution with North Korea. 
Kim Jong Il has 11,000 artillery tubes dug in around the demilitarized zone, all aimed at Seoul. In the opening hours of a war, tens of thousands of people could die, military officials here say. 
"Here's the strategy," one American official said. "Tell the North Koreans, quite publicly, that they can't get away with it. And say the same thing to Pakistan, but privately, quietly."

HEADLINE: CITY BUDGET DEAL INCLUDES 18% RISE IN PROPERTY TAXES 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
The city's property tax rate, frozen for a decade, will rise by 18 percent on Jan. 1 under an agreement announced yesterday between the Bloomberg administration and City Council leaders.
 "It's a painful measure," the Council speaker, Gifford Miller, said in announcing the agreement in the Red Room at City Hall shortly after 4:30 p.m. The deal will also prevent the immediate closing of any firehouses. 
 "But when you are hemorrhaging money, you have to take painful measures," he said. "So we believe that this property tax increase is the lowest that we can go while still protecting the residents of the City of New York, addressing the budget gap and being able to freeze this rate and hold it there."
Faced with a deficit of $1.1 billion this year and $6.4 billion for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2003, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had asked the Council for an immediate 25 percent increase in the property tax rate in addition to about $844 million in spending reductions. 
But council members made it clear that they were seeking a tax rate increase of 12 to 18 percent, and to restore a fraction of the mayor's proposed cuts to various city agency budgets, including enough to prevent the immediate closing of eight firehouses that the Bloomberg administration had planned to shutter.
Mr. Miller said he and the mayor agreed to those requests as part of the broad outlines of what the speaker called the "agreement in principle," which restores nearly $50 million in proposed service cuts, on Friday night. The speaker then consulted with other council leaders, before spending about two hours yesterday in a rare Saturday session with most of the Democratic caucus discussing the particulars of the agreement over pizza. According to members who were present, the mood in the council lounge was somber, but resigned.
"We know that we have to step forward and raise revenues," said Bill Perkins, the deputy majority leader, who represents central Harlem. "It's not easy for the members to do what we have to do, but they're going to do it, and we'll be ready for Round 2 after we get past this round."
Councilman David Yassky, who represents Brooklyn Heights and Greenpoint, as well as parts of Park Slope, Williamsburg and Boerum Hill, said, "Nobody wants to go back and tell people to vote for us and say 'We're raising your taxes,' but I honestly think it's the right thing to do. 
"A couple of people wanted to gripe about it," he said, "but most of us recognize that we don't have a choice."
Mayor Bloomberg's chief spokesman, Edward Skyler, said the administration was not disappointed that the Council had not agreed to a higher tax rate.
"We're pleased that the City Council recognizes the severity of the city's fiscal situation and is willing to take the actions necessary to close the budget deficit," Mr. Skyler said. "We will continue to work with the Council to finalize this agreement as soon as possible."
The 18 percent increase, which the Council could vote on as early as tomorrow, would raise the overall tax rate to $12.28 per $100 of assessed value, from about $10.37. Mr. Bloomberg had said he would be happiest with a rate of $12.96. The new rate is expected to add roughly $343 to the annual tax bill of a typical single-family-home owner, and roughly $496 to the annual tax bill for the typical owner of an apartment in a large co-op building.
The increase will bring in about $839 million in the current fiscal year, about $300 million less than the nearly $1.2 billion that a 25 percent raise would have yielded. Next year, the city should receive about $1.7 billion from the higher property tax, council officials said.
The Bloomberg proposal would have yielded approximately $800 million to put toward next year's budget, which has a projected gap of $6.4 billion.
As expected, advocates representing people who would be affected by the budget deal voiced concerns, but their objections were so muted that they did not appear to seriously threaten the agreement.
John Doyle, vice president for government affairs of the Real Estate Board of New York, a trade group that had been lobbying against the increase, said yesterday that he would turn his efforts toward gaining a reduction in the rate for next year.
Saying that a 12 percent increase was more appropriate, he added: "A property tax is not based on one's ability to pay. It's based on the value of the asset. And so if you've been living in your home for a number of years and the value of that home could have increased, it could have doubled or tripled, certainly your income has not doubled or tripled. And so you're being taxed beyond your ability to pay."
Council officials said that for each dollar they restored to this year's budget, they cut a dollar from another area, but they could not say last night how much -- if any -- surplus the new plan would roll over into the next fiscal year.
Council leaders said they were still working out the details of the restored cuts. But under the agreement, the eight firehouses slated to close would remain open while a commission studies how to cut about $2.5 million from the Fire Department's budget. The administration also agreed not to privatize some ambulance service, which will cost the city $2.5 million.
Under the plan, the Police Department would still reduce its July 2003 class of rookies by 1,900 and the Department of Education would still be hit with $200 million in budget cuts. The new schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, has promised that those cuts will not affect classroom instruction, and the feeling at the Council is that since Mr. Bloomberg won his much-prized direct control of the system, if the schools suffer it will be his political cross to bear.
At the Administration for Children's Services, about $18 million is slated to be restored through re-estimating costs and other administrative steps, according to the Council's finance staff. About $5 million of that will pay for 2,500 day care slots, $5 million for preventative services in special schools and $4.55 million to foster care providers.
About $9.6 million that was to be cut from the budget of the City University of New York will be restored, including a scholarship program, funds for community colleges and money for teachers at the Hunter College Elementary School and Hunter College High School.
The Council also won back about $885,000 in financing for a program that provides weekend meals for the elderly. Extra trash pickups in certain commercial districts would also be saved, at a cost of $700,000.
The plan restores $6.4 million to the Department of Youth and Community Development to cover various services, including sports, arts and after-school programs.
At the Department of Business Services, about $923,000 would be restored to various economic-development programs and to the city's tourism bureau, finance officials said. About $1.5 million would be restored to the city's libraries to buy books, and council leaders pledged to do whatever was necessary to keep the libraries open at least five days a week.
The finance officials said that they were able to pay for the restorations by reducing expenses that had been overestimated, including $15 million in subsidies to private bus companies, about $5 million in utility costs and $10 million in interest savings on the city's debt.
For now, city officials are concentrating on fine-tuning the agreement for the current fiscal year, which ends in June. Because the rate change would go into effect in the middle of that year, the 18 percent increase will add roughly $171 to a typical single-family-home owner's tax bill this year, according to members of the Council's finance staff. The typical owner of an apartment in a large co-op could expect to pay an additional $248 this year, while the owner of a lavish Manhattan office building would pay an extra $374,000 this year and $747,000 next year.
Mr. Miller said yesterday that the administration had agreed to help lobby state lawmakers to approve a new tax on absentee landlords of small residential buildings, defined as one-, two- and three-family homes. Part of the proceeds from the tax, which council officials estimate at more than $100 million a year, would go to offset higher property taxes for elderly people on fixed incomes.
And with next year's looming deficit of more than $6 billion, city officials said they were planning to spend the next several months lobbying Albany and Washington for other taxes and revenue enhancements.
"This doesn't solve our budget gap," Mr. Miller said. "We're going to need, as I said, support from Washington. We're going to need support from Albany. We're going to need to take other measures. We're probably going to have to do some more cuts."

HEADLINE: Tentative Deal Ends Dispute That Closed West Coast Ports 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
President Bush announced this morning that the West Coast port operators and the longshoremen's union had reached a tentative settlement, ending a dispute that had closed 29 seaports before he obtained an injunction to reopen them last month.
 The new six-year agreement, an official close to the negotiations said, includes a raise, a substantial pension increase and far-reaching measures to allow port operators to use new technologies. The two sides declined to disclose details of the agreement, enabling union officials to first explain the deal to their members. 
 "This agreement is good for workers, good for employers, and it's good for America's economy," Mr. Bush said.
Before the announcement, the dispute had threatened to close the West Coast ports on Dec. 27, when the 80-day injunction was to expire. Among shipping companies, stores and factories, there were fears that the International Longshore and Warehouse Union would strike when the cooling-off period ended.
On Sept. 29, the port operators and shipping lines closed ports and locked out 10,500 longshoremen, saying that the union was engaged in a slowdown, something the union denied. On Oct. 8, President Bush got the injunction to reopen the ports.
On Nov. 1, the union and the Pacific Maritime Association, which represents the port operators, reached agreement on the main issue that had long divided them -- new technologies. Throughout the dispute, the union said that it would accept computerized cargo-tracking systems only if management agreed to keep many jobs union as well as transform some nonunion jobs into ones under union jurisdiction. The introduction of more efficient technology would cost the jobs of more than 400 unionized clerks. 
In the agreement, management got the right to introduce the technology in return for a pledge not to lay off workers whose jobs were replaced by automation; the union will maintain jurisdiction over jobs it feared would become nonunion.

 THE EMERGING DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY
By John B. Judis
and Ruy Teixeira.
213 pp. New York:
A Lisa Drew Book/Scribner. $24.
 Most books of political prognostication enjoy a brief half-life from their publication date to the next election day, but even after the recent Republican gains, "The Emerging Democratic Majority" deserves much better than a trip to the remainder bin. It is an informative and intellectually adventurous study of how economic, demographic and cultural changes are affecting Americans' political behavior. Its provocative conclusion is that those changes are producing a "progressive centrist" majority that will give Democrats an advantage similar to the edge that Republicans enjoyed during the 1970's and 80's. 
Echoing Kevin Phillips's 1969 classic, "The Emerging Republican Majority," which saw the seeds of Republican ascendancy in Richard Nixon's narrow victory the year before, the journalist John B. Judis and the demographer Ruy Teixeira contend that the Democrats can build a base for future victories on what Bill Clinton and Al Gore won in the three presidential elections from 1992 through 2000: 20 states and the District of Columbia, with a total of 267 electoral votes, only three fewer than a majority. They say that three decades of social and economic change have shaped a society favorable to Democrats: "a new postindustrial metropolitan order in which men and women play equal roles and in which white America is supplanted by multiracial, multiethnic America." 
Judis and Teixeira find this future in metropolitan areas like California's Silicon Valley and North Carolina's Research Triangle, with high-tech industries and highly educated workforces -- seamless webs of cities and suburbs that they call "ideopolises." There, they locate three constituencies that are growing larger and more Democratic: racial and ethnic minorities, educated working women and skilled professionals.
With growing numbers of Hispanic and Asian-American voters to go along with African-Americans, the authors argue that it will be more difficult for "Republicans to cede the minority vote and still win elections." Female voters also increasingly support Democrats.
In their most original observation, Judis and Teixeira report that highly educated professionals have shifted from the Republicans to the Democrats. Not only do they tend to be social liberals, but professionals like physicians also find that their efforts to do their best work are thwarted by the market economy that conservatives uncritically endorse. 
Judis and Teixeira raise important issues, but they unduly emphasize the most educated, affluent and avant-garde constituencies. Thus, they lump together professional and technical workers of all kinds, and generalize from human service professionals, who tend to be more liberal than those in private industry. Similarly, their portrayal of ideopolises seems based on suburbs close to cities, like Bethesda or Brookline, not outer suburbs. They ignore the segments of middle America that Democrats neglect at their peril: people who work in midlevel technical, sales and service jobs and live in communities with more churches than Thai restaurants.
This stress on upscale voters is new for both authors, particularly Teixeira, whose previous book, "America's Forgotten Majority"(with Joel Rogers), argued that the decisive voters were moderate-income people without four-year college degrees. "The Emerging Democratic Majority" does discuss these voters, but usually as an afterthought. When they do address working-class concerns, the authors offer genuine insights, especially about persistent economic insecurity.
"The Emerging Democratic Majority" is an indispensable study. But it merits attention less for its prophecies than for its inquiries into the new ways that Americans live, work, think and vote -- changes more complex than any analysts, including these authors, have yet explained.

 He walks over to the computer at the far end of his L-shaped office and clicks a couple of times to print out a document filled with tiny-font numbers. He marches back, places it squarely on the conference table in front of me and wheels his chair over, right up to my face, to take me through the data. His thick fingers coast down the page, pausing to emphasize the data points that excite him most. 
"Selling -- number of nights away, number of days I'm in the field, total." (Forty-eight.) 
"Selling here, how much time I'm going to spend on the phone, on P.R." (Eight hours total.) 
He continues down the page, excited and preternaturally focused. All we're talking about is how many minutes per year he spends on e-mail (180 days at 60 minutes per day, plus plane trips) and how much of his time his vice president for marketing can have in 2002 (12 hours), but his intensity makes it seem utterly absorbing. 
Ballmer loves this scheduling system. The assemblage of tiny grids is both a necessary practicality of the way he must now go about his job -- with the far-flung Microsoft products and markets, there is simply no way he can be the old-fashioned be-everywhere boss he would otherwise like to be -- and a symbol of the new personality he would like to present, for himself and, in a sense, for the entire company: older, wiser, calmer. Also: transparent. Gone are the days when Microsoft didn't mind being seen as a secretive evil empire.
Ballmer has worked for Microsoft since his pal Bill Gates lured him there in 1980, and throughout his career he has been known as a singularly aggressive salesman who would cut deals with Microsoft's business partners within a hair's breadth of putting them in the red. And those were Microsoft's friends. He screamed so much at sales meetings that he shredded his vocal cords and required surgery. He publicly insulted Janet Reno at a time when it was not, to say the least, in his company's best interest. In one notorious video clip that was widely circulated on the Internet (where it was tagged "Monkeyboy"), Ballmer was shown exhorting a roomful of Microsoft employees in ways that seemed, well, primal. The company took its behavioral cues from him. 
Yet only after fighting the biggest antitrust case in a century has it begun to sink in with Ballmer that in most ways he has already won, and that with victory he might be expected to behave less like a petulant adolescent and more like a statesman, comfortable in his power. Recently, in the span of one week, Microsoft first received the news that a federal judge approved the company's settlement with the Justice Department and rejected the remaining suits by individual states, then came out with a powerful new-product launch, its much hyped Tablet computers. Both of these developments indicate that the company is exiting the fog, legal and otherwise, of the last few years and is entering a period that will largely be shaped by Ballmer. With his schedule rigorously organized, his managerial duties more defined than ever and his personality in a state of self-imposed overhaul, he aims to prove that he can be a different person and that the Microsoft Bill Gates has essentially handed over to him can be a different company.
In June, Ballmer sent an e-mail message to Microsoft's 50,000 employees that could reasonably be called a manifesto. With the help of his ghostwriter, he laid out a new mission statement for the company: "To enable people and businesses throughout the world to realize their full potential." This extraordinarily expansive statement was notable for how little it specifically said about software or computers. Instead, it was about values and corporate culture. "The events of the last four years and the changes in our industry make this a good point to take stock of ourselves and our mission, to understand how others perceive us," Ballmer wrote. "Many of us feel a disconnect in the way we see ourselves and our mission and motives, and the way we are portrayed, and only we can change that."
Ballmer went on: "Helping change the world in the way we aspire to isn't easy. . . . We need people who have their own strong personal values, as well as those necessary to be successful at Microsoft." The points he hit hardest were ones that were pretty alien to Microsoft tradition. Openness. Respectful of others.
In this way, employees were put on notice that respect was now an official part of their job descriptions. Ballmer even said that it would become an important part of midyear reviews, which were slated to start within a month after the memo went out -- "so we had about two days to start behaving respectfully," one employee cracks.
For Microsoft, this all marked a serious departure. In earlier days the ethos was simple: either you fit the mad-dog Mensa mold as defined by Gates and Ballmer or you didn't stick around for long. On campus, you didn't give a second thought to how any off-campus types might regard you. 
The imperative to change this culture was partly about business and partly about politics. Though the bulk of Microsoft's revenues comes from its dominance in desktop software, the products known as Windows and Office, these divisions are growing less than 10 percent a year. Meanwhile, its other big source of income, server software, is in a fiercely competitive sector in which there is powerful downward pressure on prices (in part because one competitor -- Linux -- is free.)
That means that growth has to come from elsewhere -- from businesses that run the gamut from Internet service to video-game consoles. In these sectors the company lacks the incredible leverage it has in software, so it can't get away with simply being a bully. It has to make friends with a range of partners savvier and more powerful than the computer manufacturers it had grown accustomed to pushing around. It needs to persuade consumers to try new, unfamiliar products like Tablet PC's.
At the same time, there are the political issues. Though the federal case is over, Microsoft was found by a court to be a monopoly, and every move the company makes for the foreseeable future will be scrutinized for abuse of power. "I'd love to tell you it's behind us," Ballmer says, "but until we find out what happens with the nonsettling states and the European Commission, I don't take the view that it is. We're pleased to have taken a significant step." 
There was no celebration in the office the day earlier this month when the judge's ruling came down. Ballmer happened to be in a meeting with Gates, a routine "people review" session. A company lawyer stopped in to say that a preliminary reading of the ruling looked promising. Ballmer patted his old friend on the back -- "I can't say there was any jumping out of chairs," Ballmer says -- and resumed their meeting.
One thing that did not go away is the previous ruling that Microsoft does in fact have a monopoly in PC operating systems, though Ballmer says carefully, "That's not a word I use." Sounding like a football coach admonishing his team not to let its guard down against a vastly inferior opponent, he says: "The thing I don't want people to forget is how competitive a business we're in. We are in a competitive business." Which is exactly where someone like him wants to be.
The Microsoft partnership started in college. It had been the dream of Ballmer's father, a Swiss immigrant who settled near Detroit and worked his way into management at Ford, that his son would attend Harvard, and after showing a gift for math, Steve gained admission. There he managed the football team and sold ads for The Crimson. He and Gates bonded while cramming for an economics exam. Neither had attended many of the lectures, and when Gates tells this story, he still gloats about having scored one of the class's highest marks -- this a quarter-century and $50 billion later. 
Perhaps that's because it was one of the last tests Gates ever took. The following summer he dropped out of school and moved to Albuquerque to start a software company with his Seattle computer-geek buddy Paul Allen. A few years later the company moved to Washington, and Gates called Ballmer about coming to work there. After a few months of reading scripts in Hollywood and 18 months of pushing instant-cake mix at Proctor & Gamble, Ballmer was set to enroll at Stanford's business school. At first he resisted Gates's offer, in part because his father was opposed to his abandoning the corporate track he had set out on. It took a full-court press from Gates's parents to persuade Ballmer to leave Stanford after his first year there and join the ranks of dropouts in Redmond. In June 1980, Ballmer became Microsoft employee No. 26. 
The two ran the company more or less by fiat for 20 very successful years, creating a chaotically Darwinian culture in which the projects that won their support were the ones most aggressively fought for, if not always objectively the best. But as the company grew huge, centralized control became untenable. Starting in the early 1990's, a series of "adult supervision" executives were brought in to help give Microsoft a more professional structure, one that didn't rely entirely on Gates and Ballmer. 
Gates's voluntary abdication to Ballmer actually began after the release of Windows 95, the platform that firmly established Microsoft's dominance. The relentless drive to complete it had distracted the company, and within a year Netscape and the rest of the nascent Internet industry had industry analysts questioning Microsoft's relevance in the emerging New Economy. No sooner had Gates redirected his troops with his now famous "Internet Tidal Wave" memo than the Justice Department began the latest and most serious of its antitrust investigations, charging Gates et al. with using their desktop monopoly to destroy competing businesses.
By early 1998, with the mounting pressures of overseeing Microsoft's legal defense, running the multibillion-dollar company, which was growing 25 percent annually, and being the father of an infant daughter, Gates was overwhelmed. He turned where he always did in crisis -- to Steve Ballmer.
Microsoft's board (possibly including Gates himself) previously quashed talk of promoting Ballmer to chief executive; it had concerns about the sales chief's hotheadedness. This time, though, Gates lobbied on his old study partner's behalf; Ballmer, he argued, was no longer the volatile force who brought out Windows but a more circumspect executive with a tremendous understanding of the business's totality. Gates promoted Ballmer to president in mid-1998; in January 2001, he was named C.E.O., the second in Microsoft history.
Gates officially graduated into his current elder-statesman role, the in-house visionary, while Ballmer took over day-to-day management. Early in his term the world around Ballmer changed drastically. Just weeks after he took the helm, his father died of lung cancer. (His mother succumbed to the same disease a few years earlier.) A year into the tech-stock crash, the market for PC's and software was in one of its biggest slumps ever. And Ballmer still had to deal with the fallout from Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling the previous year that Microsoft had in fact repeatedly exhibited anticompetitive behavior and that it should be broken apart. One possible outcome was that Gates would lead one Baby 'Soft and Ballmer another.
This prospect didn't merely threaten Ballmer's ambitions; it was a personal affront. It was as if the government had ordered a couple who had spent 20 very happy years together to divorce. It offended his sense of loyalty, a trait that defines Ballmer. (This is a man who will still drive only American cars, out of deference to his father.) At the same time -- and despite the early, impertinent comments about Janet Reno -- he had to be the one who would not take the government's case personally, who would view the matter as simply another challenge of doing business. Gates simply could not do this, though he would be the one who was, as Ballmer refers to it, "on point" on legal strategy.
While Gates leads a prominent public life, managing the dispersal of his foundation's vast riches, Ballmer lives an almost ordinary existence. With Connie, his wife of 12 years, he has three boys; his oldest son's basketball team is, it is safe to say, the only one in its league to be coached by the C.E.O. of a Dow component. The Ballmers' house on the eastern shore of Lake Washington is large but by no means palatial (in contrast to the Gateses' $50 million spread a few miles away); because until just recently their neighborhood did not have D.S.L. service, when Ballmer needed to go online from home he used a dial-up connection. One minor extravagance: a former coach for the SuperSonics shows up to coach his weekly 6 a.m. pickup basketball game.
Once a champion curser, Ballmer claims to have renounced swearing when he became a father. A compulsive eater for most of his adult life, a year ago Ballmer set his mind to trimming down; he signed on to a serious weight-loss program at his local gym, including regular Overeaters Anonymous-type group therapy, and dropped 50 pounds. Though he won't say that the slim-down is related to his goals at work, it's hard not to see the connection; his formerly tremendous girth seemed the proper match to his personality. The lean Steve Ballmer certainly looks like a new person.
Judge Jackson's antitrust ruling precipitated a conversion experience of a different kind. "This was a company that never stopped for self-reflection until the world forced it to stop for self-reflection," says one tech-industry veteran with close ties to the company. 
Ballmer says that his priority became the repair of Microsoft's relationships with its customers and colleagues. He has become more solicitous of former foes, like the Silicon Valley venture-capital community; his visit last year to the V.C. kingpin Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers was a mission of peace. In its biggest collaboration since a 1991 rift surrounding the OS/2 operating system, Microsoft is working with I.B.M. to develop standards for Web-based business services. He even sat down with his archrival Larry Ellison to talk over how Microsoft and Oracle products might work together better. 
In conversation, Ballmer regularly chides himself for just having said something that was "over the top." He knows he's supposed to curb the effusions that he suspects may be inappropriate for a man in his position -- but it's clearly a struggle. Business for Ballmer is a physical experience. He feels it with bodily intensity and acts it out with force. 
The newest Ballmer buzzword is "wallow," as in what you've got to do to solve a really tough, complicated problem -- take days, weeks even, to "wallow" in it, with all the hippo connotations of tremendous physical presence and without the traditional Microsoft pressure to right then and there devise and implement some genius solution. In the old days, Ballmer, say his current colleagues, would sight-read your spreadsheets and tell you that what you were doing was simply wrong. Now Ballmer prefers to wallow. 
Within Microsoft, the tightly disciplined members of the executive staff are very much on message. They are deadly earnest in their conviction that Ballmer doesn't yell anymore. Instead of dominating all discussions, they say, he asks leading questions designed to teach his charges how to approach problems.
Of course, the notion that Steve Ballmer has transformed himself is, well, less than totally credible. Departed senior executives, of whom there are many, relay plenty of late-vintage stories about one outburst or another. "They say he's stopped screaming?" a former executive asks. "Then that's new in the last two weeks." 
Ballmer himself admits that there's "some mythology" to the notion of his transformation. He admits to craving customer visits, one-on-one sales meetings, consecutive days of jet-lag-be-damned 16-hour strategy meetings in Paris -- being in the game and, as he says (hitting the table), "really jazzing." 
As far as the yelling goes: "I do that much less frequently." The reason, he says, is that his approach to the job has changed. "As soon as I say, 'I'm not solving this problem; I'm helping somebody else solve this problem,' I change modes. If you put me in a meeting where I think I'm supposed to figure out the answer, I'm as likely to be as much bull in the china shop as I ever was. It's not personal, I don't intend to hurt anybody. I just don't think I'm getting through to people. I get frustrated."
Flashes of the old Ballmer personality still come through. The last time I spoke to him, we discussed two things -- the antitrust settlement and the Tablet PC -- and the difference in his tone on the two subjects was stark. On legal matters, he labors to follow a script, measured and subdued; on the new product, he breaks out into evangelical mode, his voice almost squeaking as he proselytizes about the "many changes we're going to see in the PC form factor over time." 
It reminded me of my very first encounter with Ballmer. On that day, WorldCom was covering the front page with reports of billions in accounting irregularities; the company's executives fell all over themselves to deny any knowledge of the misdeeds.
Is there any way, I asked Ballmer, that a chief executive claiming not to know about billions of dollars is anything but ridiculous?
Ballmer started with a disclaimer. "I'm sympathetic," he said, "to the notion you don't know everything." Then he smiled a broad smile and began to bounce around in his chair like a kid who forgot to take his Ritalin. "I humor myself to believe that if there was gonna be anything like that kind of a swing in our business, I would know" -- he pitches sharply forward and snarls -- every last detail of that."
Doesn't that put him right back where he started -- doing everything himself? "You have to know you've got the systems in place to ensure the job is being done responsibly," he said. "And if it's not even being done responsibly Affecting a plaintive voice , at least you're reporting on it! Pantomimes grasping a thick report 'Hey, we're doing a terrible job! Louder, pleading But here it is! It's in black and white! We can't meet your expectations! Laying the mimed report in front of me, now shouting, sobbing and pleading Here's our pathetic performance!"'
Ballmer snorted, pleased with the acting job, then caught the eye of the company P.R. rep. "Anyway," he added, calming down, "a little over the top there."

HEADLINE: Scott Ritter's Iraq Complex 

BYLINE:  By Barry Bearak; Barry Bearak is a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
At the back of the auditorium, a man cupped his hands over his mouth, improvising a megaphone, the better to bellow: "Iraq is not the problem. Enron is!" By then, the waiting crowd had already overstuffed Old Snell Hall on the campus of Clarkson University in northern New York. With all 500 seats filled, 100 people wedged themselves onto spare patches of the peeling linoleum floor. Most of the crowd wanted to hear the case against war, and they were exuberant to be hearing it from Scott Ritter, the onetime United Nations arms inspector and now America's most unlikely peacenik.
 Ritter did not disappoint them, talking powerfully without notes for nearly an hour and drawing the kind of prolonged ovation he has come to expect and relish. President Bush is force-feeding Americans "a whole bunch of oversimplified horse manure," he told them boldly. "None of what you are being told remotely resembles the truth. Facts do matter, and it is time that you, the American people, start demanding the facts." War is not a video game where a reset button resurrects the corpses, Ritter said. "War is about dead people." 
 At 6-foot-4, Ritter is a man of imposing bulk, with arms long enough to bear-hug a podium. An astonishingly tireless talker, he buries listeners in an avalanche of opinions, anecdotes and details. The pile-up of his words seems all the weightier because he draws on his seven years as a weapons sleuth. He is also astonishingly self-confident. The day we first met, he spoke of a rare capacity to distill truth. "I'm a great analyst," he said, firmly and without irony. "I've never been wrong."
Ritter's current view, which he dispenses with the earnest vigor of a revivalist, is that the administration's case against Saddam Hussein is based on elaborate falsehoods and exploited fear. He says he would "be surprised if there is anything in Iraq worth finding," claiming inspection efforts between 1991 and 1998 resulted in the Iraqis giving up 90 to 95 percent of their most deadly weapons, rendering Saddam "fundamentally disarmed" -- if still unrepentantly evil. His suspicion is that the renewed inspections soon to begin will be but a show trial before the hanging. "The U.N. resolution is worded to allow President Bush to act militarily without Security Council approval," he scoffs. "For evidence, he'll pull the same unquestioned charade he has been pulling right along." 
When listening to Ritter on stage, speaking as he does with the authority of first-hand experience, it can be easy to overlook that his present renown as a dove is his second turn at celebrity. The first was his renown as a hawk, in August 1998, when he very publicly quit his job, complaining that Iraq was blocking inspections and the Security Council was disinclined to stop them. "The sad truth is that Iraq today is not disarmed anywhere near the level required," Ritter wrote in his letter of resignation, quickly becoming a hero to many of the same people who now revile him. The following week, in a widely reported Senate hearing, the former major in the Marine Corps said that even if disarmed, the Iraqis had a "breakout scenario" to fully replenish their biological and chemical weapons within six months. He beseeched America to pressure Iraq into "full compliance." Then, writing for the New Republic, he offered a long list of horrors likely to remain viable in Iraq's remnant arsenal if inspections were discontinued, including "biological agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin and clostridium perfringens in sufficient quantity to fill several dozen bombs and ballistic-missile warheads." 
This seeming contradiction is routinely called a "flip-flop" by critics, and the perplexity it has created now dogs Ritter as he travels. Recently, I made two road trips with him as he kept to a grueling schedule of speechmaking. At each stop, even among the friendliest of audiences, he was asked about it. In public, his tendency is to be brusquely dismissive: "I don't see where I've changed one iota." In private, however, he is prone to answer this and other questions with harangues, loosing a stream-of-conscious flow that churns and circles, carrying along glimmers of brilliance, incoherence and self-pity. He is not easy to fathom.
"It's not that I was lying or misleading anyone," he said of his earlier remarks. "It's just that I said things very forcefully when the fact is there should have been a statement afterward, a 'but' kind of thing." Back then, he said, he was using his "quantitative filter," speaking as an arms inspector about an unfinished job, seeing a cup 10 percent full. Later, he switched to his "qualitative filter," seeing Iraq as 90 percent empty and enfeebled.
This is typical of Ritter. Even when admitting he is wrong, he is insisting he is right. His self-image requires it, for more than a life story, he has a personal mythology. Ritter, 41, loves the telling of it, which he does exceptionally well. In each chapter, he is the courageous man of principle, a stout-hearted citizen up against the dimwitted, the wicked and the power-mad.
For what it's worth, I found him very likeable and, as he burst into his diatribes with my tape recorder spinning, I rooted for him, wanting to warn him not to do what he so often does, shooting himself in the foot by shooting off his mouth. So much sincerity is rarely companion to so much vainglory, and so much certainty rarely accompanies such vacillation. Ritter is reliably convincing. He just doesn't always agree with himself.
Yet there has been constancy, too. His foremost goal remains unchanged, he said. "I've always wanted the inspectors back at work, and I wanted to preserve the integrity of the inspection process." 
So "flip-flop" is actually an inapt word, he protested, suggesting as it does a lack of integrity. "I think 'evolved' is a term I am comfortable with, because it implies a passage of time and everything changes over time. I mean, my taste in beer might evolve over time."
Besides, as Scott Ritter tells the saga of the past decade, with all the intrigues and double-dealing -- it wasn't he who flip-flopped on America.
It was America that flip-flopped on him.
That story begins in Baghdad, but for me, the hearing of it began last month on U.S. 87, heading north in Ritter's Dodge Caravan from his home in suburban Albany. "So I said, I want to be an intelligence officer," he told me, recounting a favorite tale. He was a newly commissioned second lieutenant in the Marines. There was a rule: intelligence work first required three years in the combat arms. With stunning moxie, he wrote the Marine commandant. "I said, My name is Lieutenant Ritter, and I'm the best damn intelligence officer you're ever going to meet." For him, they changed the rules, he boasted.
Being the best was important to him. Both his parents were career Air Force. But he chose the Marines. In 1988, four years into his career, he was sent to Votkinsk, a Russian city in the foothills of the Urals, well known for producing Tchaikovsky, the composer, and SS-25's, the missile. Ritter monitored compliance to a ballistic-missiles pact.
When the gulf war began in 1990, his missile expertise was valuable. But as Ritter tells it, his analytical skills only got him in trouble. His job was to assess battle damage to Iraqi forces, and his analyses, while dependably correct, differed from those of the generals, who saw only what they wanted. He was told to "sit down at a desk and shut up," he said.
Ritter would eventually leave the Marines in June 1991. He had been looking for a civilian job when he was contacted by one of his superiors from the days in Votkinsk. There was a chance to do something challenging. The gulf war, however crushing a defeat for Saddam, left him in power. Among the cease-fire conditions, Iraq was to fully disclose its weaponry for mass destruction so that the stockpiles and means of production could be gutted under United Nations auspices. For this, the Security Council formed a special commission, called Unscom.
As a whip, earlier economic sanctions were to stay in place until the disarmament was complete. But this was not lash enough for Saddam. With shell games and outright obstruction, he kept his weapons as best he could. Unscom was expected to end its main task within months and then set up a system of long-term monitoring. Instead, the job went on year after year, with Ritter, as he later wrote, at the center of it, passing "through the looking glass of Saddam Hussein's hellish netherworld."
Ritter frequently led Unscom inspection teams. Several of his former colleagues make him sound like an action figure in a kid's cartoon: honest, intrepid, smart, pathologically patriotic. Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish diplomat who was Unscom's first chief, said Ritter lacked "a good understanding of the complexity of the political issues," but he had total confidence in him as an "excellent operational planner." Roger Hill, an Australian, marveled at Ritter's snapshot memory: "We'd be in an Iraqi office and he'd memorize things in Arabic script -- and he wasn't even an Arabic speaker."
By Ritter's count, he was nearly killed three times while on Unscom business. The retelling of one incident injects drama into his speeches: his United Nations convoy stopped at multiple gunpoint, AK-47's and pistols aimed every which way, two directly at his head. "A day in the life of the inspector in Baghdad!" he says, as the story crescendos to its conclusion.
Ritter describes inspections that required up to six months of meticulous study and rehearsal. Imagine the choreography of it, he says. With helicopters hovering above, his people hit the site from four directions, intercepting the radio traffic, cameras recording everything. "That's an inspection, ladies and gentlemen!"
Unscom destroyed more of Saddam's doomsday weapons than the heavy bombardment of the gulf war. But it was always impossible to know what percentage of the total had been eliminated without knowing what the total was to begin with and whether that total was somehow expanding. Increasingly, nations took morbid notice of the effect of the sanctions on the Iraqi people. Support began to wane for an equation that would always have an uncertain answer: Iraq minus how many weapons equals enough?
For his part, Ritter enjoyed being such an important gumshoe. It was hard to catch the Iraqis red-handed, but sometimes when you confronted them, they tripped up like second-rate burglars, he said: "There wasn't anyone there I couldn't crack. They were putty in my hands."
As time passed, though, it became clear that high-tech surveillance was needed. And, of course, this was a problem. The United Nations had no resources for that kind of spy gear. It would have to come from member nations, which had their own political agendas. Ekeus gave Ritter the O.K. to solicit such help, and in time this strategy gave rise to several odd arrangements. Among them, Unscom used an American U-2 spy plane, which, though piloted by the Air Force, flew under a United Nations logo and followed a United Nations flight plan. The aerial photos required interpretation, and when Ritter thought the Americans were not supplying the required decipherment, he received permission to get help from the Israelis, who became one of his best sources. 
Saddam would complain that Unscom was being used as a cover for American and Israeli espionage operations, and it was true that the relationships between inspectors and the intelligence agencies they relied upon were complicated and sometimes compromised. Ritter was enveloped by spy games, and they thrilled him. He had stuff going with the Brits, the Aussies, the Kiwis. He joined the Romanians in a "major intelligence sting." But the clandestine work, however vital, occasionally had his head doing somersaults about vying loyalties. This arrangement -- an American citizen mingling with foreign operatives while being responsible only to the United Nations -- was highly unusual. Ritter felt compelled to ask the Central Intelligence Agency for guidance, but, he says angrily, "the U.S. government would never commit -- never commit -- to modalities or rules and regulations." Ritter sorted it out this way in his mind: America supported the Security Council, which oversaw Unscom, which oversaw him. He felt he was on solid ground as long as he informed his U.N. bosses of everything.
But in January 1998, he learned the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating him for espionage with the Israelis. "The idea of it, questioning me on the subject of patriotism!" he said. To add to his ire, he had been told that the F.B.I. also held concerns about his wife, whom he had met in Votkinsk, where she had worked as a Soviet translator. Some in the F.B.I. thought she might be an agent, "a hostile penetration attempt." He was furious.
These personal woes also accompanied other disappointments. By 1998, Unscom itself was flagging. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had earlier declared that even if Iraq disarmed, sanctions would continue as long as Saddam was in power. Iraqis had one less reason to cooperate. They grew more brazen in blocking inspections, and the Security Council was letting them get away with it.
At the same time, Ritter was contending with a reputation as a cowboy. Some promising inspections were canceled from above at the last minute. Richard Butler, the Australian who succeeded Ekeus as Unscom's chief, told me these missions were of the "kick-the-door-down variety" and he thought them "ill conceived and possibly dangerous." But Ritter suspected other reasons. He was in a turf battle with some elements of the C.I.A. The Americans were leaning on Unscom, freezing him out of the loop.
After thinking it through, resigning seemed the thing to do. Concerned that he might be arrested, he consulted a lawyer and began talking to the news media even before he quit, protecting himself by preparing to get his story out, raising his profile. People in the American government worried that he might become dangerously talkative. He got a nervous call from someone attached to the National Security Council, he said. So Ritter laid down his terms: "I'm going to walk away, very critical of your policy. You've got to be grown up about that. What I don't want, though -- if you come after me and call me a liar, I'm going to tell the truth. If you question my patriotism, I'm going to demonstrate how I was a patriot. Come after my family, I will expletive you all.' Those were my words."
The day Ritter resigned, CBS News reported that the F.B.I. was investigating him for showing classified intelligence to the Israelis. Though the report added that "officials say it appears Ritter did nothing wrong," for him, it was the fateful tripwire. He declared war.
When he testified at the Senate hearing eight days later, he constrained his criticisms to those things his adversaries could be "grown up about," speaking of the "ugly threat" of Iraq. Along with that, he stressed his main theme: arms inspection works, and when Saddam thwarts the inspectors, America and the rest of the Security Council must intervene. The senators, especially Ritter's fellow Republicans, commended his eloquence, his patriotism, his guts. Only Joe Biden, the Democrat from Delaware, suggested that perhaps the timing of military action against Iraq might better be decided by people at a higher pay grade than Scott Ritter's.
In settling his more personal scores, Ritter went to the press, and when he wasn't going to them, they went to him, aware that his tap was turned on with stories flowing into everyone's notebooks. The most surprising venue for his revelations was the English-language Israeli daily Ha'aretz, where, in a Q. and A., he discussed Israel's featured role in Unscom's intelligence operations.
Some of the Arab world feasted on that. "What did I say in the Ha'aretz interview that was incorrect?" Ritter asked me. "Nothing! What did I say in the Ha'aretz interview that was politically inflammable? Just about everything!" But hadn't he warned the American government? When he recalls these events now, he seems to relive them, as if the words were the vital dialogue in a play's climactic turn: "If you want to play the game of truth, I'll tell the truth, and the truth will burn. It's not going to burn me. It'll burn you. Why did you play the Israel card? Why did you play it, America? To try to discredit me?"
Many of Ritter's Unscom friends, who had cheered him on before, were now disturbed by what they read. "I like Scott, but the fact that he disclosed all this Unscom activity was a very big mistake," said a fellow inspector, Fouad El Khatib.
Ritter was in high demand. The talk shows applied their makeup. Some of the super-rich invited him to a retreat in Aspen. Henry Kissinger and Colin Powell listened to his take on foreign policy. NBC used him as a military analyst. At the network, he tried to wow his new colleagues. William Arkin, another NBC analyst, remembers joining Ritter in the company cafeteria. "Unbelievable diarrhea of the mouth," he said. "He's got a serious case of I've-got-a-secret." 
Simon & Schuster paid him a $250,000 advance for a book. Ritter's preference would have been to bang out the whole cloak-and-dagger story, something to "out-Tom Clancy Tom Clancy and out-John le Carre John le Carre." But the editors wanted more of a policy book, and they needed it in a hurry, while Ritter and Iraq were still in the news. The deal was signed in early December, three and a half months after his resignation. Ritter saw the writing task as straightforward: explain what a brute Saddam was and how to get rid of him.
But then, in the middle of his high-velocity writing, the author suffered a jolt of analytical whiplash. On Dec. 16, 1998, the United States, with British support, launched Operation Desert Fox, four days of bombing. With the Clinton administration finally hammering Saddam, one might have expected Ritter to be elated, but in fact, he thought it a travesty. Desert Fox had come without the approval of the Security Council. In Ritter-think, America was bound to the United Nations by treaty, and treaties were backed by the United States Constitution. "We've broken the law and compromised our morality," he says. Besides, speaking as a Marine intelligence officer, he also thought the operation nothing more than a futile pinprick. If they wanted to bomb, they should have hit Saddam for a full 60 days. "I could've shown them the targets," he says.
Ritter's book, "Endgame: Solving the Iraq Problem Once and for All" would have to end with a different solution, he realized. Further complicating things, Simon & Schuster moved his deadline up to Jan. 15. He had but a month more to write and think. This frenzy of introspection resulted in a turnabout. In the final chapter, Ritter's "endgame" swerves from the use of overwhelming military force to patient diplomacy. Several reviewers thought it a muddle.
At any rate, the book sold poorly. By the time it came out in April, Kosovo had elbowed Iraq from the news. The world was looking elsewhere.
Though Ritter's celebrity withered, his urge to speak out did not. He was willing to go anywhere, said Jennifer Horan, a Boston peace activist who knows him well: "He went from being taken in limos to 'The Today Show' to driving himself to the basements of ill-heated churches to talk to 30 people." His messianic side, once solely directed at finding Saddam's lethal weapons, had reversed compass and was targeted now at Washington's failed policies. He spoke often of the thousands of Iraqi children dying because of the sanctions. And at least once he publicly regretted his own part in America's misreading of the situation. In May 2000, appearing at a Congressional briefing, he said Saddam was incapable of "world or regional domination" and admitted that "a lot of the blame for the perceptions" to the contrary could "be laid at my doorstep."
That briefing proved significant, not for what Ritter said but for whom he met. Shakir al-Khafaji, a wealthy Iraqi-American businessman, was in the audience. The two men struck up a conversation. Within weeks, Ritter was telling al-Khafaji about a documentary he hoped to make, a film about Unscom that might find the audience that "Endgame" had missed. The two agreed to become partners in Ritter's production company, with al-Khafaji's real-estate development firm, the Falcon Management Group of Southfield, Mich., investing $400,000. While the businessman did not have any control over the editorial content, both men say, al-Khafaji would be supplying his connections as well as his money, easing Ritter's way back into Iraq.
As a veteran intelligence officer, Ritter knew he ought to be wary of this deal. The F.B.I. probe had not resulted in any charges, but here he was, about to receive cash from a wealthy Iraqi with important friends in Baghdad. Ritter said he went to great lengths to check things out, though on this score he is less than convincing. Where did he get his information? "I called a reporter who has sources in the C.I.A." Does he know where the $400,000 came from? "They showed me the stocks and bonds that were being liquidated." Was al-Khafaji getting any quid pro quo from the Iraqi government? "Shakir said he didn't," Ritter told me on one occasion. On another he said, "That was always in the back of my mind, that the Iraqis have an interest in funding the movie." Before going to Baghdad, Ritter informed the F.B.I., he said. This candor was a supposed safety net. "I raised our profile so high that the F.B.I.'s got us dead to rights. If he is getting a quid pro quo, you'd think the F.B.I. would know about it."
Al-Khafaji, 46, has lived in America for 27 years. I spoke with him twice on the phone. While he is an active critic of American policy, he had no praise for Saddam either. On the other hand, he does have many friends in the Iraqi government. He comes from a prominent family. Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, "is our neighbor," he said. Scoffing at any notion of a quid pro quo, he said to the contrary, it was hard to convince the Iraqi government to cooperate. "They didn't trust Ritter," he said.
The businessman, like Ritter, said he had hoped the film would make money. If so, this was a naive miscalculation. "In Shifting Sands" presents a 92-minute story Americans are unused to, with the United States at least the equal of Iraq in bad faith. Indeed, America is portrayed as a bully, needlessly inflicting pain on a woebegone nation. Ritter bemoans the shame of it, the United States "pursuing a brutal dictator to the point of debasing our own moral and intellectual values."
Whatever the film's merits, TV stations and movie theaters had little interest. All investors, including Ritter, lost money, they say. This of course was a disappointment. More important for the former arms inspector, it denied him the influential role he believed he deserved. Not only did he consider himself one of America's leading experts on Iraq, he says he thought he could become a peacemaker between the nations. Last August, he began to feel a greater urgency for that mission as carrier of the olive branch. He expected President Bush to use the anniversary of 9/11 as a "jingoistic springboard" for attacking Saddam. To prevent war, he believed the Iraqis needed to respond to worldwide pressure and allow the weapons inspectors back in, and he wanted to go to Baghdad to convince them. "My feeling was that -- and it's not an ego thing -- but in military terms I am a silver bullet. I can generate attention quickly. I have a credibility on the subject that most people don't."
He phoned al-Khafaji. "I need to speak to the Iraqi National Assembly," he remembers telling him, adding two requirements: "It has to be televised live. And it has to be before Sept. 11." Impressively, al-Khafaji was able to arrange a meeting with Tariq Aziz, who asked, Why do you want to speak to the National Assembly? They're nothing. "I know they're nothing," Ritter says he replied. "But I'm looking for something symbolic. It's theater being played out here. We are staging an event, a media event!" 
Ritter loves this new chapter to his myth. "The Iraqis trust me because for seven years I held their feet to the fire," being tough but fair, he told me. No American had previously addressed the Iraqi National Assembly. Ritter wrote his speech on his laptop, on the drive into Iraq from Jordan. On Sept. 8, parliamentarians listened politely as Ritter told them that America "seems on the verge of making a historical mistake." We Americans are a good -- no, a great -- people, he told them. But because of 9/11, "we are a nation fearful of the unknown and more easily prone to exploitation by those with agendas other than legitimate self-defense." He said in the current crisis, the truth was on Iraq's side. He praised the Iraqis for their "full cooperation" with past arms inspections. 
That last part, certainly, was an "evolution" in thinking. But one thing had remained the same. Ritter still wanted the inspectors back to work.
War, definitely by Christmas, is Ritter's prediction. He told me this the other day, just after the latest Security Council resolution demanding the return of the inspectors was passed. As it turns out, even with the resumption of inspections, he sees no room for optimism. "Just a setup, a smokescreen," he said. The Bush administration has put its reputation on the line. Whether or not weapons are found, expect the bombing to begin. When he hears Bush speak of underground facilities, he says, "I know I spent five years investigating that with ground-penetrating radar, with the best geophysicists around." The presidential palaces may have underground bunkers, but not underground factories. "There's no James Bond; there's no Dr. Evil. The Iraqis are incompetent! They can't do it." 
Well, maybe they could. Occasionally, Ritter is scrupulous in pointing out that he doesn't know for sure what the Iraqis have been up to these past four years. Mostly, however, he shuns such overcomplication.
These days, Ritter is in greater demand than ever. The schedule is crazy: Madrid on the weekend, Texas on Monday, over to Strasbourg on Tuesday. In Europe, he speaks at political forums, while in America, he mostly appears on college campuses and on talk TV. 
The Baghdad trip opened his flank to a fusillade of criticism. He has been ridiculed as Ritter of Arabia and Hanoi Jane. But the slight that seems to wound him the most is that he too much loves the limelight. "I'm going to unplug from this thing so quickly people will be shocked," he told me huffily, saying what he wants most is time with his family and his golf clubs. Then he made a surprise announcement. "I'm going to graduate school next fall; I'm getting a Ph.D. I'm going to teach. O.K.? Is that seizing the spotlight?" 
Actually, I can envision this quite well, Ritter eventually with a faculty position, a class of students taking notes. There are plenty of professors who believe their analyses have never been wrong. In time, though, he said, academia could conceivably lose him to public service. "If my country ever calls upon me to serve, if someone thought I could ever be a good assistant secretary of defense or state, I would smartly salute and go off to serve my country," he said, immediately worrying that this sounded as if he longed for the limelight. "If you write that, people will say I am lobbying for it. I'm just being honest with you here."
On the drive back to Albany, we took the road through Lake Placid. I pondered the prospect of Ritter without the limelight. He would sorely miss it, just as he now misses his wife and twin daughters and a good tee shot.
As the highway turned east, trees seemed to be tossing leaves into the wind. Everywhere, brilliant oranges and yellows were afloat, though the scenery was more serene than the conversation. Ritter had launched into one of his better rambles, the one where he hates Saddam as much as the next guy, probably more. "Blow the hell out of him, 60 days of bombing, kill them all," he said. I inquired, Who's them? "All the senior Iraqis. They're poison. They are absolutely poison." 
I asked, But isn't that what Bush wants to do? "Bush isn't smart enough," he said. "There are only a handful of people that are smart enough to do this" -- Ritter himself among them.
But in mid-harangue, his peaceable side resurfaced. He was talking again about the Constitution and how Americans needed to honor their commitments to the United Nations. "The Constitution defines what I have to do," he said.
I thought the matter might end there, but Ritter was still in turmoil. "My heart's telling me to kill Saddam, or, I don't know, maybe my gut tells me that," he said. "My heart's telling me to do what the Constitution says, but the gut's saying kill Saddam. And my brain has no clue which way to go here. It's just twisted. And I'm honest when I say I get up every morning and I just want to get the hell out of this."

No Hope

BYLINE:  By James Traub; James Traub is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
This month's election was the first one since 1990 that was not, in some sense, a referendum on Bill Clinton. The president who drove Democrats and Republicans almost equally crazy, though not necessarily at the same time and about the same things, is now, at last, history, as he was not quite after the 2000 presidential election. The man who defined the 90's as Reagan did the 80's seems to have left a much less lasting imprint on his party than Reagan did. A New York Times/CBS News Poll taken just before the midterm election found that only 31 percent of voters knew what the Democrats stood for. And no wonder: while the Republicans ran on protecting America from evil, the Democrats ran on prescription drugs. The party's message has dissolved into a heap of programs. 
 How had this come to pass? Clinton, after all, had spent virtually his entire time in office defining exactly what it was that Democrats stood for. Of course, that may have been precisely the problem: Clinton's detractors, including a great many Democrats, now see him as a promiscuous and serial redefiner who changed the meaning of the word "Democrat" depending on that week's polls. But that's not quite fair. As a candidate in 1992, Clinton said of the Republicans, "They don't want to fix government; they still want to campaign against it, and that's all." Clinton's consistent goal was to give the state credibility by fixing it -- by making it more responsive to the marketplace, guided more by outcomes than by ideological principles. 
 And even when he famously declared in 1996 that "the era of big government is over," he went on to say -- not so memorably, to be sure -- that "we cannot go back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves." The goal then was to preserve the idea of an activist government in the face of Newt Gingrich's onslaught -- and in this Clinton succeeded. The broader goal was to fit even the most modest policy prescription into a larger framework of values, which allowed Democrats to address middle-class Americans for the first time in a very long while.
There are several obvious reasons "Clintonism" did not survive Clinton as "Reaganism" survived Reagan. One is simply that Clinton left office a disgraced figure, while Reagan left as a hugely popular one, at least inside his own party. Second, Reaganism, which is to say a distrust of government and an abiding faith in personal initiative, romantic patriotism and an aggressive posture abroad, constituted a call to purity for a party that had drifted to the center. It was thrilling Republican music. What Clinton offered, by contrast, was an antidote to the old-time religion. It was never an emotionally satisfying theology, and it wasn't a very easy tune to hum -- except for Clinton himself. Al Gore inadvertently proved how very hard it was in the 2000 election, when he ran first as the centrist, pragmatic Clinton of 1996 and then, when that wasn't working, as the tilting-at-windmills Clinton of 1992. What hung together with Clinton seemed forced and artificial with Gore.
In the postelectoral recriminations that are still echoing throughout the country, you can almost feel the Democrats' yearning to break out the old party war dance -- why didn't we turn the campaign into a referendum on Bush's 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut? The tax cut seems almost certain to crowd out domestic spending, hugely expand the deficit and magnify inequality; but since most of its provisions haven't yet gone into effect, it hasn't done any of those things so far. Walter Mondale in Minnesota and Erskine Bowles in North Carolina opposed the tax cut and lost races they were given a good shot at winning. On the other hand, Democrats in Georgia, Colorado, Texas, New Hampshire and Missouri championed the tax cut and also lost -- and would probably have lost bigger had they taken on the tax cut. 
Clinton was like Reagan in one critical respect: he provided a temporary illusion of compatibility for mutually irreconcilable positions. Though his own views were perfectly straightforward, Reagan served as a kind of symbolic nexus for conservatives, bringing together libertarians, fundamentalists, cold warriors and Wall Street moguls. The Reagan legacy did, in fact, become contested ground in the decade after Reagan's departure, as these groups waged a fight for primacy. The G.O.P. finally achieved a new kind of synthesis in George W. Bush's "compassionate conservatism." Clinton was, of course, more protean -- or maybe the word is "contradictory." He enjoyed enormous black support even as he vowed to "end welfare as we know it"; he entrusted the economy to Wall Street's favorite banker even as he inveighed against the excessive compensation of C.E.O.'s. And so perhaps the Democratic splintering of 2002 differs from the Republican splintering of 1988 only in that Reagan got his vice president elected and Clinton didn't.
The necessary debate has already started. The "San Francisco Democrat" Nancy Pelosi -- a moniker Republicans love to repeat -- has replaced Richard Gephardt as minority leader in the House. But during the few days that her candidacy was contested, Harold E. Ford Jr., a moderate from Tennessee, was quoted as saying, "If you believe that the same old tired, failed politics of the Democratic caucus is a direction we ought to travel, then clearly Nancy's your choice." Since Ford was thinking of the same tired, failed politics that Clinton himself allegedly put to rest, it is safe to say that whatever process of political rethinking the Democrats have been engaged in at least since the mid-80's is a long way from over, and perhaps also that the national drift to the Republican party that began in the 1970's has not yet run its course. Bill Clinton himself may be history, but the Democrats still need to debate the lessons of his presidency.

Today we can declare: government is not the problem, and government is not the solution. We, the American people, we are the solution. . . . We need a new government for a new century, a government humble enough not to try to solve all our problems for us but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves, a government that is smaller, lives within its means and does more with less. Yet where it can stand up for our values and interests around the world, and where it can give Americans the power to make a real difference in their everyday lives, government should do more, not less."

An Avuncular Uncle He Is Definitely Not

BYLINE:  By TED LOOS

 BODY:
TWO years ago, Joel Soler chose to go on a dangerous journey to the Middle East to shoot an irreverent biography of a dictator who was then, in Mr. Soler's words, "a dead story."
 Now the subject of "Uncle Saddam," which is being shown Tuesday on Cinemax, is probably the world's most talked-about person. As the world debates about war with Iraq, Mr. Soler's film introduces a strange new perspective on Saddam Hussein. 
 Did you know that Saddam likes to be greeted with a kiss near the armpit? That he sometimes fishes with grenades? That he is building the world's largest mosque near a man-made island shaped exactly like his thumbprint? These are among the personal details Mr. Soler has gathered in his highly selective and darkly humorous biography, meant to highlight what he calls the "camp" aspects of a dictator's rule.
"When I went to Baghdad, my goal wasn't to get Saddam himself," Mr. Soler, 34, said recently over lunch in the East Village. "I knew he didn't speak to anyone. My goal was his entourage. No one had done those interviews."
To get them, Mr. Soler, a freelance television journalist and French citizen who lives in the United States (because of a death threat, he declines to say where), spent six weeks in Baghdad and a month in Egypt and Jordan. He interviewed Mr. Hussein's interior designer, his architects, his cousin and his personal filmmaker, as well as exiled former ministers.
Mr. Soler also made contacts who later smuggled out film of Mr. Hussein, which he combined with his own images to make this fast-paced, opinionated film.
The cult of personality around Mr. Hussein is mocked by the soundtrack music -- including "No Regrets" and "La Vie en Rose" -- and the tongue-in-cheek narration written by the comedian Scott Thompson of the "Kids in the Hall" troupe.
"I wanted to bring a deadpan tone," said Mr. Thompson, who was Mr. Soler's companion when they collaborated on the film. "You're dealing with such a monster, there's no need to oversell it through words."
Though an invitation to Iraqis to stay in the presidential palace as human shields against bombing is described in the narration as "a giant sleepover party," Mr. Soler does not shy away from the grim realities of Mr. Hussein's rule. About half of the film traces the ways he has shut out, imprisoned or killed many members of his own family.
From the beginning of the project, Mr. Soler had to use subterfuge. As a French citizen he enjoyed an advantage, since France has historically had good relations with Iraq.
"I pretended I was doing a movie against U.S. sanctions," Mr. Soler said of his application to the Iraqi embassy in Paris. "You don't say, 'I'm going to do a funny homage to Saddam.' That doesn't work too well." 
Mr. Soler, who once studied Sumerian art at the Louvre, also said he was interested in Iraq's architecture.
"If I was with Saddam's interior designer, yes, I asked him about the palaces, but then at a certain point I would just ask, 'What is Saddam like?' " Mr. Soler recalled. 
Once his camera crew arrived, his questions began to unnerve the two government agents who accompanied him everywhere, as well as the interviewees. "They knew that it's a death sentence to say the wrong thing about Saddam," Mr. Soler said.
But he grew increasingly bold. During an interview with one of Mr. Hussein's chief designers and architects, Hussam Khadori, Mr. Soler locked the government agents out of the room.
"They were furious with me," Mr. Soler said. "The question was, how far could I push my luck?"
He found out quickly. The next day, he said, the agents took him to a hospital, ostensibly to show the tragic consequences of the economic sanctions against Iraq.
"They put me in a hospital room, and a nurse came toward me with a needle," Mr. Soler recalled. "The agent told me, 'We're going to do a series of blood tests.' I said, 'What?' I jumped up on the exam table and said, 'You call my ambassador right now.' "
Mr. Soler was given a choice, he said: take the tests (for which no reason was given) or leave the country at once. He chose the latter.
The drama didn't end once filming was finished. One night, the house he shared with Mr. Thompson was covered in blood-red paint and a small kerosene bomb exploded in his garbage can. A note in the mailbox instructed Mr. Soler to "burn this Satanic film or you will be dead."
He also learned that the two Iraqi agents assigned to him had been punished for letting him roam.
"Do I feel guilty?" Mr. Soler asked. "Not really, since they are agents of that regime. But I did feel guilty when I got a call from the State Department saying that two of Saddam's designers had been murdered." 
Mr. Khadori was one of them. It's not known if the killings were connected to "Uncle Saddam"; Mr. Khadori's murder occurred well before the film was completed.
"Joel was very young and more cavalier when he started the project," Mr. Thompson said. "This made him realize that everything you do has repercussions."
Mr. Soler was raised in Nimes, France. Though both his parents had grown up in Algeria when it was a French colony, he knew little of the Arab world until he started traveling in Dubai and other Middle Eastern cities when he was in his 20's. 
"It spoke to my heart," Mr. Soler said of the Middle East. "Even though I am Christian, I have a real passion for Islam -- the Islam of Muhammad. If it wasn't for the Islam of today, I would have converted." Now he is also studying Arabic.
So far, "Uncle Saddam" is scheduled for broadcast in many countries -- but not his own. "I got so much backlash for this film in France," Mr. Soler said. "I got one letter from a network saying that they didn't want to buy an American propaganda movie." 
He said that his only worry was that the film would add to American misperceptions about the region.
"There is so much anti-Arab feeling here, and I know my movie is not going to help," Mr. Soler said. "But I hope that people who see this movie know the difference between Saddam and Islam, and Saddam and Arabs."

Video on Demand Is Finally Taking Hold

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Video on demand may be the most significant development for the Couch Potato Nation since the remote control, and the cable television industry hopes that it may soon become almost as popular.
 After years of failed promises, unripe business plans and half-baked technology, the cable industry is finally beginning to deliver reliable and economical video-on-demand services. 
 Want to watch an episode of "Sex and the City" from last month? Punch a few buttons and sit back as the program begins when you want it to. Phone ringing? Hit pause on the remote, and the program will freeze. Miss a line? Press rewind. Bored? Choose from hundreds of other films, series and specials -- none of which requires you to record it ahead of time. 
Video on demand reached a significant milestone recently, when Time Warner Cable announced that by the end of the year the service would be available throughout the company's biggest market, New York City, where it has 1.2 million subscribers.
Besides Time Warner Cable, owned by AOL Time Warner, other big companies now offering video on demand around the nation include Comcast and Cablevision. The Yankee Group, a technology research firm, estimates that by the end of this year about seven million homes around the nation will have access to video on demand, up from only about three million at the end of 2001. 
Despite the omnipotence that the label implies, video on demand does not allow users to watch any program or movie under the sun. No database is yet infinite. But in New York City, for instance, Time Warner Cable plans to have 1,300 hours of programming available at any one time -- the equivalent of almost two months of TV watching. 
Video on demand is the newest and most technically sophisticated of various digital services on which the cable industry has spent billions of dollars in recent years. Many of the other new digital cable offerings have primarily been improvements on existing products or services. Cable modems are lightning fast, for example, but they are basically a sped-up version of conventional dial-up computer modems. Digital television offers many more channels than does old-fashioned analog cable, but it essentially amounts to television watched the old-fashioned way. 
Video on demand, by contrast, is an entirely new capability -- the one that cable operators are counting on to help justify their huge investments and to help fight their battle against satellite television providers like DirecTV and EchoStar. Those companies cannot provide video on demand because satellites beam their signals to an entire region or continent and so cannot send multiple streams of different programming to individual viewers.
"From a cable operator's perspective, you've got satellite stealing away a lot of your high-paying subscribers, and you need an application that adds value to the cable service," said Adi Kishore, a Yankee Group cable analyst. 
Cable operators say video on demand is precisely that application.
"We really believe that this is a clear competitive advantage," said Mark E. Hess, vice president for digital television at Comcast, which became the nation's biggest cable company when it completed the acquisition of AT&T's cable unit last week. "If we can get a great mix of content to our customers, they will embrace the ability to start, stop, pause and watch television on their schedules."
The emergence of video on demand from the laboratories and spectacularly expensive tests of the mid-1990's has been made possible by technical innovation and ever-falling technology prices. 
The first major test of video on demand was an experiment conducted by Time Warner Cable in the Orlando area beginning in late 1994. Back then, Time Warner's "cost per stream," or the cost to provide each video-on-demand channel to a household, was about $13,000, according to cable executives and analysts.
"The set-top box alone during Orlando was probably close to $5,000 each," said Robert C. McIntyre, chief technology officer for Scientific-Atlanta, the nation's biggest maker of cable television equipment. "Between the set-top and the server costs, we had close to the price of a car in there for each stream." The server is the video-server computer that dispenses the video programming a viewer selects.
Currently, the per-stream cost for video on demand is about $475, and Mr. McIntyre predicts that the figure will fall below $300 by early 2004.
Before a cable company can offer video on demand, however, it must update its system to provide digital two-way communications. The digital technology overcomes the barriers of the old analog one-way communication, which limited a cable subscriber to receiving only whatever programming the system operator was sending to all authorized users.
Many of the nation's big cable companies, including Time Warner and Cablevision, have mostly completed their digital overhauls. Some of the AT&T cable systems that Comcast has acquired, however, still require digital updating.
The current figure of $475 per stream refers to the costs of two steps that must be taken after the digital renovation has been completed on a given cable system. The first step is acquiring video servers, which are huge hard-drive arrays configured with special chips and software for delivering television-quality video signals. The second step is installing the cable gear required to transmit on-demand signals to homes.
The costs of both steps have plunged in recent years, along with the costs of necessary components like processor chips and hard drives. 
"We have definitely been able to take advantage of falling prices and increased performance at a given price for most of our components," said Michael J. Pohl, chief executive of nCube, the private company that is providing the video servers for Time Warner's New York City rollout. So far, analysts generally consider nCube to be No. 3 in the video-server market, behind two publicly traded companies: Concurrent Computer and SeaChange International. 
For the cable companies, a potential stumbling block is that video-on-demand systems will not allow more than perhaps 10 percent of the households in a neighborhood to use the local service at the same time, because of cost constraints. But cable engineers like to point out that even the most reliable telephone networks and municipal plumbing systems are not engineered to allow more than a fraction of the potential users to call or flush at the same time. 
The engineers and some cable analysts predict that the 10 percent limit will more than suffice most of the time, and that if demand regularly exceeds supply, the companies will spend the money to expand their systems' capacity. 
"I think they are planning to add more channels anyway, which would not be difficult," said Mr. Kishore of the Yankee Group. "You can always be faster and cheaper, but I don't think there are a lot of remaining technology challenges."

HEADLINE: 007, Still Fulfilling Fantasies and Filling Seats 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 24 

 BODY:
With the Hollywood studios scrambling to create fresh new franchise series so that they -- and the global media conglomerates that own most of the studios -- can promote them on everything from books to lunchboxes, the time is ripe to take a look back at the granddaddy of them all for clues about what it takes to keep a franchise going.
 "James Bond is one of those heroes that all guys feel they could actually be like," said Pierce Brosnan, who has played the agent in the latest four films. "He loves women, he loves booze, he loves great cars. I mean, from time to time, we all get to dress up in a tuxedo and feel like we could be James Bond." Apparently so. "Die Another Day," the 20th 007 adventure, opened on Friday to some of the series's best reviews and earned an estimated $47 million in its first three days, the biggest opening ever for a Bond film. (It took over first place from "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" which, in its second weekend, earned $42.4 million, down by 52 percent from its debut, a common drop for such blockbusters.) 
 When Bond first appeared on screen John F. Kennedy was in the White House, Gene Chandler's "Duke of Earl" was on the radio and a loaf of bread cost about 20 cents. 
And in the 40 years since Sean Connery first uttered the immortal words "Bond, James Bond" in "Dr. No," 007 movies have sold more than $3.4 billion worth of tickets. Four other actors have played the dashing, womanizing and vaguely sadistic British secret agent. Mr. Connery played him six times, George Lazenby once, Roger Moore seven times and Timothy Dalton twice. 
And there were two other, spoofier takes on 007 -- "Casino Royale," with Woody Allen as Jimmy Bond, in 1967, and "Never Say Never Again" in 1983, with an aging Mr. Connery in a reprise of the role in an economically threadbare Britain -- but neither was part of the official series.
"Why does the James Bond series endure when so many others have not?" said Michael G. Wilson, a producer of "Die Another Day" who has worked on each of the 007 films since "The Spy Who Loved Me" in 1977. "That's what everyone wants to know." Mr. Wilson would like to think it has something to do with having a hands-on team of producers who are with the project from Day 1. Another reason may be that while the 007 movies are released by MGM (and, before that, its United Artists subsidiary), they are essentially a family business.
Mr. Wilson's stepfather was Albert R. Broccoli who, with his partner Harry Saltzman, got the series started and guided it through its first decades. "For us it's like a family business," Mr. Wilson said.
But the filmmakers say they really believe the key reason for the films' success is that they never lose faith in their character. "That sounds kind of obvious," Mr. Wilson said. "But you go back and review a lot of these series and see what happened to some of them. Notice how they lost faith in their main character and decided to focus on the villains or the effects or whatever. No matter what else was happening, no matter what story we decided to tell, we never lost faith in James Bond."
That the series has changed is beyond question. The early installments, while considered fast-paced entertainment in their day, seem almost leisurely today. "The movies have changed to match the standards of their day," Mr. Wilson said.
The first two films -- before the British-made series became an American phenomenon with "Goldfinger" in 1964 -- were fairly inexpensive efforts, with plots that resembled other spy thrillers of the day. But beginning with "Goldfinger," and then accelerating with the much larger budget for "Thunderball" (1965), the series became bigger and more gadget-filled with every installment. By the time Mr. Connery handed the series to Mr. Moore in 1973, the spectacle and the stunts had come to subsume the characters and plot elements.
Attempts to reduce some of the campy comedy and bring 007 back to his espionage roots with Mr. Dalton had mixed box-office results. But after a six-year hiatus, when Mr. Brosnan took the role in "Goldeneye" (1995), the series proved to be as popular as it had ever been, mixing some of the big-stunt elements of Mr. Moore's films with the harder-edged espionage elements of Mr. Connery's.
"It's a big role, and it will knock you down," Mr. Brosnan said. "But you can't be scared of it."
Mr. Brosnan said he felt increasingly comfortable in 007's skin as the series progressed. "Each one has had some kind of progression or maturity to it," he said. "Basically, I've already done it three times, so this time I thought, 'Just get on with it.' You know it, so trust it and do it.' "
And as action films have gotten bigger and louder and faster, James Bond has adjusted to match contemporary taste, Mr. Wilson said.
"Die Another Day," for instance, is the first Bond movie to make extensive use of computer-generated effects -- like a collapsing glacier -- although it still has several scenes built around live-action stunts, like a mud-splattered hovercraft battle. 
Lee Tamahori, the New Zealand-born director who made the current film, said he struggled to keep the action sequences as plausible as possible and to maintain a mix of actual live stunts and computer images. One big test, he knows, is a scene in which Bond dangles from a glacier in a rocket sled and then, as the glacier collapses, fashions a ski from the hood and a kite from a parachute and uses them to surf an icy tidal wave to safety.
"O.K, I know, as far as plausibility goes, it's a stretch," Mr. Tamahori said. "But I made sure that, at least, we came up with an explanation of how Bond did it."
In the early days directors, like the actors, tended to sign on to Bond films for extended tours. Terence Young, Guy Hamilton and Lewis Gilbert each directed several. But since MGM revived the series with Mr. Brosnan, the producers have gone with a different director each time. This, Mr. Wilson said, was another attempt to keep the series fresh. 
"When you cut through it all, what it really comes down to is the character of James Bond," said Chris McGurk, vice chairman of MGM, who is counting on his studio's prime franchise to help salvage an otherwise lackluster year. "It's an elemental thing. He's the ultimate fantasy."
One thing that the studio did this time around, Mr. McGurk said, was to get the series out of the two-year cycle that it had maintained since 1995. "We didn't like being in the position of picking a release date and then working our way back to create the movie," he said. "We said: 'You know, let's just stop and wait for a minute. Let's get a story we like first.' "
One unanticipated result has been the creation of Jinx, the American superagent played by the Oscar winner Halle Berry. The character has proved so successful, and Ms. Berry enjoyed playing it so much, that plans are afoot to create an entirely new franchise series built around the character, the first time that the Bond series has spawned a spinoff, a new trick for a very old dog.
"Lately a lot of other movies have been released that have these characters who are supposed to be the new James Bond," Mr. McGurk said, an apparent reference to recent adventures like "XXX," starring Vin Diesel. "If anything, I think they have created even more interest in 007. He's the original, and he's the best. So we look upon these imitators as sort of homages to Bond. We think they've reinforced the power of the franchise."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW; 
Psychiatrists Do Battle, Mental Illness In the Middle

BYLINE:  By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
Dialogue fueled by testosterone and paced like a volley of bullets is at home at the Atlantic Theater Company, one of whose founders was David Mamet. At the moment, however, that dialogue has an unfamiliar accent. It is featured in the American premiere of "Blue/Orange," a ferocious comedy by the young British playwright Joe Penhall, and it just goes to show that Americans have no monopoly when it comes to men who crave wielding power over other men.
 The battle in "Blue/Orange" is between two psychiatrists, Robert Smith (Zeljko Ivanek), a senior doctor at a London hospital, and his protege, Bruce Flaherty (Glenn Fitzgerald). The battleground is the treatment of a young man named Christopher (Harold Perrineau Jr.), who has received the diagnosis of a borderline personality disorder but who may be more seriously ill, as Dr. Flaherty believes, with schizophrenia. Christopher is about to be released, but Dr. Flaherty wants him recommitted, a course of treatment that Dr. Smith opposes. It doesn't take long, however, for Christopher's interests to become less of a focus for his caretakers and more of a mallet with which they take turns beating each other. 
 That Christopher is black complicates matters in an intriguing fashion; Dr. Smith is at work on a book that claims that ethnic and cultural factors are undervalued as psychological influences, and he intends to use Christopher in his research, which Dr. Flaherty finds appalling. On the other hand, it is Dr. Flaherty's careless vocabulary that offends Christopher.
Mr. Penhall, who is just 34, has yet to achieve the economy and precision of Mr. Mamet's finest renderings of psychological warfare, as seen in plays like "Glengarry Glen Ross," "Speed-the-Plow" and "Oleanna." Partly because British hospital jargon and psychological diagnostic discourse are employed a great deal and partly because there is some self-justifying speechmaking by the two doctors that is dramatically artificial, there are moments when the verbal blows being dealt are obscure enough to the audience to seem like phantom punches. The play ends on an uncertain note. 
But Mr. Penhall has nonetheless created some brawny characters here, not to mention a conflict that justifies some high-powered verbal brutality. Neil Pepe, the Atlantic's artistic director, obviously eager to tap the subconscious fury of the two doctors, has directed the show to be merciless to them both, on a brightly lighted, sleekly spare set by Robert Brill that suggests both a boxing ring and a goldfish bowl. And though neither Mr. Ivanek nor Mr. Fitzgerald is athletically imposing, both can get their hackles up pretty menacingly in defense of their terrain. They're an entertaining undercard.
As the main event, Mr. Perrineau is both magnetic as an actor and impenetrable as a character, which is precisely how it should be. His Christopher, who can be so hopped up on his own adrenaline that he isn't allowed coffee or Coke, can also stare in apparent thoughtful understanding for minutes at a time. He can converse with reason and occasional wit, and even argue a point with argumentative force and without simply gainsaying. 
But he maintains an unshakable belief that oranges are blue and claims that Idi Amin is his father. When he's listening, it's unclear how much he is absorbing, and even when he breaks his own silence with a non sequitur, it is with a flicker of internal logic. His performance never falls back on the cliches of lunacy. Nor does it ever grope for sympathy. Rather, Mr. Perrineau makes you see how baffling mental illness can be, and how deeply unreachable the mentally ill.

HEADLINE: E-Commerce Report; 
EBay is the Internet's retailing success story. So why are some people making cautionary noises?

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
EBAY, the online auction house, remains the undisputed champion of e-commerce, with a stock market value ($21.6 billion as of Friday's close) that is more than double that of Amazon. It also has a dearth of serious competitors and a coterie of investment analysts who cheer eBay's every move.
 And yet there exists a small group of Wall Street analysts with the gall to put a "hold" rating on eBay's stock, while other industry trackers have recently sprinkled their eBay praise with cautionary notes. 
 Take Forrester Research, the online consulting firm. In a report last week titled "Three Things That Should Keep eBay Up at Night," Forrester argued that the company must confront some significant issues if it is to retain its market dominance in the long term. 
"It's not like eBay's going down," said Carrie A. Johnson, a co-author of the report. "But there are dangers it does face that make it potentially not as perfect as it looks."
First, Ms. Johnson said, eBay is in jeopardy of losing the equilibrium of buyers and sellers on its site. "If eBay can't convert more of its bidders to sellers, buyers will outnumber sellers even more dramatically, and prices will inevitably go up," she said. If that happens, she said, price-conscious shoppers might flock to Amazon or to Wal-Mart's Web site, with negative consequences for eBay.
Forrester says eBay's second area of vulnerability stems from its growing "enterprise seller" program, in which big companies like I.B.M., Home Depot and others dump excess goods on eBay through auctions. Ms. Johnson said that the program, which began last year, could alienate eBay's smaller sellers because consumers are more likely to trust these name-brand companies than they do independent sellers. The result could be depressed prices for some of the site's rank-and-file merchants.
If that happens and small merchants form some sort of coalition, they could "get together and move somewhere else," Ms. Johnson said. "It's not likely anytime soon, but communities can move."
Finally, Ms. Johnson said that eBay remained vulnerable to fraud. The company "will have a tough time attracting new bidders if one of its merchant partners like the Sharper Image or Sears publicizes a high deadbeat bidder rate," she said, offering hypothetical examples, "or if a high-profile consumer like Katie Couric speaks on air about an auction purchase gone bad."
Responding to the first of Forrester's criticisms, Kevin Pursglove, an eBay spokesman, said the company was a "self-correcting marketplace."
"Whenever there's been an imbalance on the side of the sellers, prices will drop," Mr. Pursglove said. "If there's an imbalance of buyers, prices pick up. But over the course of the year, things stay fairly level." He said the average selling price on eBay had in fact been rising, but many analysts say that is because of the expanding sales of cars and other high-ticket items on the site.
As for Forrester's criticism of eBay's corporate selling program and its possible effect on smaller sellers, "that issue has never been backed up by any data," Mr. Pursglove said. "We've seen that the arrival of nationally recognized brands in a category helps smaller sellers, because it brings credibility to the entire section."
Again, Mr. Pursglove would not offer data that would support that assertion, but "these larger retailers account for maybe 3 percent of our gross merchandise sales, and maybe that'll grow to 8 or 9 percent over the next several years," he said. "The heart and soul of the site is still small businesses and individual sellers, so we're keeping a close eye on that."
On Forrester's final assertion, that a well publicized fraud case could hurt sales, Mr. Pursglove pointed out that eBay had already endured such fraud, like the sale in 2000 of a fake Richard Diebenkorn painting for $135,805. Moreover, Mr. Pursglove said, eBay has intensified its fraud detection efforts in the past 12 to 18 months, with some success. Less than one one-hundredth of 1 percent of all listings on eBay have resulted in fraud, he said, "and that number is nudging down each year."
While many other eBay analysts and merchants say the company's fraud problems would probably not damage it, some say they fear that sellers will become disenchanted with the Web site. Take Ina and David Steiner, editors of AuctionBytes.com, an information site devoted to sellers of antiques and collectibles. According to Ms. Steiner, the average selling price on eBay in those categories has dropped 33 percent the last two years, as an influx of sellers has flooded the market with goods.
Mr. Steiner, who along with his wife also sells collectibles on eBay, says people like him have been paying "maybe 20 to 30 percent more" the last two years at estate sales and yard sales for their inventory. "The people who are selling at yard sales think they can get higher prices because eBay's making everything collectible," he said.
As a result, Mr. Steiner said, some merchants say they cannot work on eBay because of the shrinking profit margins, so they are going back to the flea markets where they can realize higher prices. "The traditional venues, like flea markets and consignment stores, are starting to get busier again," he said.
If merchants felt enough financial pain on eBay, might they quietly move offline or to a smaller auction site, like Yahoo or ePier? One who has tried to organize eBay sellers to do just that is Rosalinda Baldwin, chief executive of the Auction Guild, an advocacy group for auction merchants.
In 2000, Ms. Baldwin helped organize the Million Auction March, which was meant to lead eBay auction sellers to Yahoo, Amazon and other sites, to penalize eBay for policies and fee structures that the auction merchants considered too onerous. But after some early success, she said, the movement quickly faded. "Herding online auction participants is like herding fish," Ms. Baldwin said. "This business is so dominated by independent-minded people, it's just not going to happen."
Youssef Squali, an analyst with the investment firm First Albany, predicted that if small merchants in the future expressed widespread disenchantment with eBay -- whether because of an influx of corporate sellers or some other reason -- the company would take care of it. "They wouldn't run the risk of cannibalizing their core business," he said. "This is one of the best-run companies on the Internet today. For them not to manage those risks would be a surprise to me."
So why did Mr. Squali initiate coverage of eBay last week with a mere "neutral" rating, when many analysts still rate it a "buy?"
"The idea is 'Love the company, not the stock,' " he said. "While we think the company will deliver on the numbers and perform well, we think investors have gotten a little ahead of themselves, and the stock is pretty much priced to perfection."
Ebay shares closed at $70.09 on Friday, near the 52-week high of $72.74 the stock reached last December.
Mr. Squali says one cornerstone of eBay's business is that it sells goods that are more valuable if they are in short supply. EBay's stock may have benefited in a similar way.
"A number of investors wanted to play the Internet-survivor theory after the bust, and saw eBay as the ultimate cornerstone of their portfolio, so they continued to bid it up," Mr. Squali said. "They've benefited from a scarcity of value among Internet companies."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Setting Pride Aside, and Stumbling Upon Day Care

BYLINE:  By JUDY TONG

 BODY:
For Francisco Ortigoza, asking for help was never easy. "It was a matter of orgullo," he said, using the Spanish word for pride.
 But then he found himself face to face with one of the classic conundrums of parenthood: how to earn money to provide for a growing family, while making sure that his children are properly cared for while he works. 
 To meet that challenge, he had to learn to set pride aside. He had to accept some help -- if he could even find it. 
Mr. Ortigoza, 32, arrived in the United States from Mexico when he was 20. Since then, he has worked tirelessly to make a better life, first for himself, then for his wife, Miriam, 31, and their daughters, Lizbeth 3 1/2, and Itzel, 2 1/2.
When he came to America, following his brother to New York City, Mr. Ortigoza spoke no English. He cleaned toilets, washed dishes and bused tables, even though he had earned an associate's degree in accounting in his native country.
Working and studying at the same time for six years, he was able to learn English and earn a bachelor's degree in psychology from City University of New York's York College in Jamaica, Queens. He paid for college himself, he emphasized, "without financial aid." Now he is a service coordinator at Mid-Island Therapy Associates in Queens.
Being self-sufficient has carried Mr. Ortigoza a long way. But it also made it that much harder when he finally needed help. 
His wife convinced him earlier this year that they needed the help not only to better their current lives, but also their futures.
Housing and feeding the family on his paycheck alone was hard; the $26,000 a year he was earning was barely enough to put food on the table. And, having just moved from Queens to the Bronx, there was no significant support system since his brothers and their families lived at least an hour's train ride away.
Someone had to care for the children, which meant that someone could not work.
Faced with that dilemma, the Ortigozas joined a far-from-exclusive club, that of families caught between the need for income and the equally pressing need for child care.
A 1999 report issued by the Children's Aid Society, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, said that the scarcity of child care subsidies threatened "parents' ability to become and remain self-sufficient." 
The report also said that the city had only "enough regulated care to serve 30 percent of the 209,000 children under 6 who may need child care while their parents work."
In 1999, the report estimated, 40,000 children were on the waiting lists for child care subsidies from the city. Philip Coltoff, the society's chief executive, said recently that difficult economic times had most likely increased that number beyond 100,000. 
The parents of those children have few choices. For families like the Ortigozas, whose relatives are not close by, drastic choices must often be made. Forty-one percent of the families interviewed for the Children's Aid report said that in order to care for their children, they had to sacrifice household essentials -- like food and clothing.
The Ortigozas were luckier than many. They found Children's Aid and its day care center by chance while walking through their neighborhood in the Bronx shortly after moving in.
The society was able to provide day care for the two children in September. Lizbeth was enrolled in the Head Start program, a federal and state program for 3- to 5-year-olds, at the Bronx Early Childhood Center, and a licensed provider cares for Itzel in her home nearby. There is no cost for Lizbeth's child care, and the cost for the provider is on a sliding scale based on income; the Ortigozas pay $10 to $20 a week.
An added benefit is the English training the two girls receive, Mr. Ortigoza said.
With the children in day care, Mrs. Ortigoza, who has the Mexican equivalent of a bachelor's degree in social work, was able to enroll in English classes at an adult learning center, and found work at a discount department store.
"It's a win-lose situation," Mrs. Ortigoza said through a translator. She wants to be able to spend more time with her family, but she needs to work to make sure there is food on the table. She works on the weekends and does not always arrive home in time to have dinner with her family.
After a home visit as part of Head Start, Yvette Saccone, a caseworker with Children's Aid, found that the family had other needs. They received $200 for clothing and $698 for furniture.
Now, the Ortigoza household is a neat, simply furnished apartment. On one wall, a frame displays a symbol of how hard the family has worked to get here: Mr. Ortigoza's York College diploma.
For the future, the family has many plans. School is foremost in their minds. Mrs. Ortigoza, who came to the United States in 1997, aspires to learn more English so that she can work in a school, as she did in Mexico. Mr. Ortigoza would like to get an advanced degree in social work or accounting.
"My wife has a degree in social work in our country," Mr. Ortigoza said. "I would like her to be able to go back to school to learn the language to do what she knows how to do."

HEADLINE: The Israeli Choice 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
I'm a shtarker. This Yiddish word, rooted in the German stark, "strong," is defined by the lexicographer Sol Steinmetz as "a strong-minded person willing to wield power." 
 This week, 300,000 members of Israel's hard-line Likud Party will choose as their candidate one of two shtarkers: Prime Minister Ariel (Arik) Sharon and Foreign Minister Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu. 
 The dovish Labor Party last week swung far left: its candidate, Amram Mitzna, promises to divide Jerusalem, uproot all settlers and re-offer all other concessions Yasir Arafat spurned two years ago. Likudniks scorn him as "Yossi Beilin with a beard," a reference to the ever-hopeful architect of the Oslo disaster. 
That means that the party of the shtarkers will win the parliamentary election in January. But which shtarker will be in charge, and does it matter?
Bibi launched his bid to seize the reins from Arik by concentrating on rebuilding the economy of Israel, now staggered by the worldwide dot-com collapse and the reluctance of tourists to enter a war zone. That economic pitch got nowhere; in Israel as in the U.S., voters are primarily concerned with winning the war on terrorists. 
Swiftly changing his emphasis, Bibi proceeded to out-Sharon Sharon -- that is, by taking positions more uncompromising than the hawkish prime minister. Accordingly, Bibi pledges not only to deport Arafat but to reject Sharon's vision of a Palestinian state after the terror ends. 
Bibi's stance would not help Likud in the general election in January because most Israelis approve of Arik's readiness to make "painful compromises," but in the primary this week, Bibi is counting on its appeal to the Likud Party's majority of hard-liners.
His fallback strategy doesn't seem to be working yet. The media polls (notoriously inaccurate in primaries there and here) have Bibi falling far behind, but internal polls show only a six-point edge for Arik and it ain't over till it's over.
Wherein lies Arik's strength? For practical Likudniks, there is the hope that the center-right, hawk-for-peace Sharon will bring along a greater plurality in the Knesset. Others are loath to reject a sitting prime minister, one of the last of the nation's patriarchs, in the midst of war. 
Then there is the element of trust. Israelis of all stripes know his word is good, and that he means what he says about peace with security. Despite all the ritual denunciation, Palestinians who want a viable democratic state know that if Sharon makes an agreement, he will be able to make it stick in an Israeli referendum.
President Bush trusts him, too. Never has the Israeli-American connection been closer at the top. This administration is well aware that Sharon runs political risk with every act of restraint under bloody provocation, and Bush has given assurances to Israel of protection when we finally move on Saddam. 
Although free-enterpriser Bibi has powerful friends here, and is far more articulate and persuasive in English on television than Arik, the older man has the advantage of gravitas and trustworthiness. Bush is properly taking no sides in this internal struggle, but few in Washington doubt that the hope in the White House is "Arik now, Bibi later." 
My judgment (undoubtedly colored by long friendship) is that Arik would be more effective in going over our State Department's head on its misbegotten notion of a "quartet" of overseers forcing a deadline for statehood. He knows that only when Arabs fight and win their civil war against terror groups like Hamas can the Palestinian majority rule. At that point, side-by-side democracies could strike a historic bargain.
So I'm rooting for Arik to win his party's nomination this week and for Likud to win seats from Labor and from Shas, the fading religious party, in January. Then I'd like to see Bibi take the finance ministry and be given a free hand to yank Israel out of its slump, while the former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky adds his moral force to the foreign ministry. When a peacemaking Arik shakes the hand of independent Palestine's prime minister, let Bibi and Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert and Education Minister Limor Livnat (the next Golda) fight it out for Likud leadership. 
Overseas kibbitzers rarely get all they root for, but I stand foursquare with my fellow shtarkers.

HEADLINE: Problem of Lost Health Benefits Is Reaching Into the Middle Class 

BYLINE:  This article was reported by John M. Broder, Robert Pear and Milt Freudenheim and was written by Mr. Broder. 

 BODY:
Diane MacPherson, of Lowell, Mass., lost her job at a relocation management company last November, and with it the health insurance for herself, her husband and their 4-year-old daughter. Her husband works in construction and does not have access to health care coverage at work.
 Continuing her family health insurance under the federal Cobra program would have cost $931 a month, so the couple decided to insure only their daughter, at a cost of $270 a month. Two months ago, when Ms. MacPherson's unemployment compensation payments ran out, they dropped their health insurance altogether. Although her husband earns about $75,000 a year, construction work is seasonal and they could not be assured of enough income every month to pay for health insurance. 
 Then their daughter came down with strep throat. "That was rather humiliating, being in the doctor's office without insurance," Ms. MacPherson said. "You become very obvious to everyone." 
The family represents a changing portrait of the 41 million Americans who do not have health insurance today. Once thought to be a problem chiefly of the poor and the unemployed, the health care crisis is spreading up the income ladder and deep into the ranks of those with full-time jobs.
According to recently released Census Bureau figures, 1.4 million Americans lost their health insurance last year, an increase largely attributed to the economic slowdown and resulting rise in unemployment. The largest group of the newly uninsured -- some 800,000 people -- had incomes in excess of $75,000. They either lost their jobs, or were priced out of the health care market by rapidly rising insurance premiums, or, like Ms. MacPherson, both.
While it is true that the number of uninsured people rises when unemployment goes up, it is also true that the rolls of the uninsured can expand even when joblessness is going down, as it did through most of the 1990's.
The numbers of uninsured during the last recession from 1990-92 jumped to 35.4 million from 32.9 million. But the number continued to rise even in the boom years of the mid- to late 1990's, reaching 40.7 million in 1998 before dipping slightly in 1999 and 2000.
Labor economists say that much of the job growth during the expansion of the 1990's came in small businesses and in service industries, low-wage, nonunion sectors that are much less likely to offer health insurance as a benefit to new workers. There was also a demographic bulge of young people and recent immigrants entering the work force during the decade, with many of them willing to take jobs that did not offer rich benefit packages.
The problem has long been acute among minorities, immigrants, part-time workers and employees in low-wage service jobs. What is different this time, analysts say, is that the problem is hitting middle-income and upper-income families harder because many of the job losses are in high-wage industries like technology and telecommunications.
Thirty million Americans in working families today -- 16 percent of all those in families headed by a worker -- lack health care coverage, according to a four-year tracking study by the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonprofit research group financed by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. An additional 16 million Americans -- mostly low-income workers -- are offered health insurance through their jobs but decline because they get health care from government programs or it is too expensive, the study found.
"The failure of the economic boom to expand employer-based coverage for working families significantly is ominous," the center said in a recent study. It found that the current slowdown and the rising cost of providing health care to employees produced a double whammy: fewer companies are now willing to offer their workers health care coverage, and those that do will demand that employees shoulder a far higher share of the cost.

Rising Concerns
Policy makers and health care analysts say the United States is again confronting a crisis in its medical delivery system. 
"The number of uninsured will continue to grow as long as health insurance premiums rise more rapidly than earnings, as they have for a decade," said Drew E. Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks health coverage trends.
"Losing health benefits is becoming a middle-class issue," Mr. Altman said. "If it had not been for expansions in the child health program and Medicaid, we would have 10 million more uninsured."
The growing number of uninsured and the rising cost of health insurance have stimulated Congressional interest on a scale not seen since 1993 and 1994, when President Bill Clinton tried to remake the health care system and guarantee coverage for all Americans.
The major proposals being debated now fall into two main categories. One approach, favored by Republicans and some Democrats, would provide tax breaks to help individuals, families and small businesses buy health insurance in the open market. The other, preferred by many Democrats, would expand eligibility for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program to include the parents of some children who are already eligible.
Either plan could have eased the situation of Brian and Anna Brooks, who run a small electrical contracting business in Westminster, Colo. They gave up their health insurance for themselves and their 8-year-old daughter this year to keep their business afloat.
They had already let go four of their five workers and wanted to maintain health coverage for their remaining employee.
Ms. Brooks said that they dropped their health coverage in July after the family premium jumped to $989 a month from $489 a month. Business was slow, and their previous income of more than $60,000 a year had fallen by half.
The effect has been immediate. Mr. Brooks, 50, has stopped taking Lipitor to control high cholesterol and has started taking over-the-counter herbal supplements. Ms. Brooks no longer takes Singulair for asthma and has adopted an exercise program intended to regulate her breathing. Ms. Brooks estimates they are saving $150 a month by not using prescription drugs.
"We changed our diets a lot in order to help the effectiveness of the supplements, and maybe that's a good thing," she said. They are setting aside $30 a month for their daughter's medical needs, but one ear infection would quickly empty the pot.
The federal Cobra program, enacted as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, is devised to provide a cushion for those who have recently lost their jobs. It allows workers to maintain their health care coverage for up to 18 months if they assume the full cost of the health coverage provided by their former employer. But many find the cost prohibitive, and only a quarter of workers say they would keep up their coverage under Cobra because of its high cost, according to a new survey from the Commonwealth Fund, a private research group.

Betting on Good Health
The high cost of Cobra coverage presents many people who have recently been laid off with a cruel choice. Audrey Robar of Milwaukee, 63, who lost her job at a private social services agency in September, decided to skip the $300 a month Cobra package in the expectation that she would soon find another job.
It was a gamble, and she lost.
"She was thinking she could get away with it," her daughter, Eva Robar-Orlich, said in an interview last week.
In the early hours of Oct. 23, Ms. Robar began to suffer chest pain and dizziness. She called her sister to ask whether she could seek medical care immediately and sign up for Cobra later. Her sister, Alden Egan, urged her to call an ambulance right away, but Ms. Robar set down the phone to look for the Cobra documents. Ms. Egan then heard over the open phone line the sound of her sister falling to the floor and quickly called 911. By the time paramedics arrived a few minutes later, Ms. Robar was dead of a heart attack.
"I think the fact that she hadn't paid for Cobra very well could have cost her her life," said Ms. Robar-Orlich. "She deliberated over calling an ambulance at a time when every minute was urgent."
Because the insurance crisis has hit high-income families and millions of middle-class Americans with jobs, advocates for the uninsured have expressed hope that Washington will finally resolve the problem. High-wage workers and small-business owners are a much more effective lobbying force than the unemployed, children and the poor.
Mary R. Grealy, president of the Healthcare Leadership Council, an industry coalition seeking coverage for the uninsured, said: "We are very optimistic. More and more people say that the uninsured will be a big issue in the next Congress."
"Lawmakers have seen the new face of the uninsured -- it's not a welfare population -- and will seek solutions for the employed uninsured," the many working families who lack insurance, Ms. Grealy said. "This is now an issue for Republicans," she added. "It's not just a one-party issue."
Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer group, said that Republicans and Democrats could agree on proposals combining tax credits with some expansion of Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
On the other hand, proposals to aid the uninsured could easily touch off a partisan brawl, in which lawmakers fight over the merits of government programs versus the private market.
President Bush has already proposed tax credits and is expected to offer more proposals to help the uninsured as part of his budget early next year.
In his first two budgets, Mr. Bush earmarked a large amount of money for health insurance tax credits: $89 billion over 10 years, for people who are not covered by an employer's plan and not eligible for public programs. The proposal languished in Congress, but Mr. Bush will have a greater incentive to push for action this year.
"The president wants to develop a record on health care to neutralize this issue going into the 2004 elections," Mr. Pollack said.
The issue is of particular concern to small-business owners, who say they would like to offer their employees health insurance but cannot keep up with the fast-rising premiums. They are a large and influential lobby and an important base for the Republican Party.
Martyn Hopper, the California state director for the National Federation of Independent Business, said that 42 percent of the state organization's 37,000 member businesses did not offer their employees health care coverage. He blames rising premiums and the high cost of doing business in California, which has imposed a number of expensive mandates on employers. Big companies, Mr. Hopper said, can move operations to cheaper locations or offshore, but mom-and-pop businesses are forced to lay off workers or make their employees pay an ever-increasing share of health care costs.
Tom Lucas, who owns two plant nurseries outside Los Angeles, said that he provided health coverage to his 70 employees until the mid-1990's, when the cost became crushing. Mr. Lucas said that some of his workers have spouses with jobs that provided insurance, some drove to Mexico to seek cheap treatment and drugs, and some did without.
He said that health coverage was particularly expensive in California because the legislature had imposed a number of mandates on the policies that employers must offer, including coverage for mental illness, comprehensive cancer screening, substance abuse treatment and weight loss programs.
"Health insurance is a luxury I can't afford for my people," he said. "It's a great perk, but in an industry like my own, it's not reality. There's not enough dollars to go around."

Roadblocks to a Solution
While there is continuing public concern about health care and gathering sentiment in Washington to do something about it, a number of constraints are limiting the likelihood that the growth in the numbers of the uninsured will be reversed any time soon.
Growing federal and state budget deficits will make it difficult to find money to subsidize coverage for the uninsured. The president and members of both parties have promised prescription drug benefits to the elderly, who vote in large numbers, and fulfilling that commitment is a higher political priority for most lawmakers than addressing the problem of the uninsured.
In addition, doctors, hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers are demanding higher Medicare payments, which will eat up money that could be used to cover people with no insurance. Medical providers are much more effective lobbyists than are the uninsured.
A number of proposals on Capitol Hill would at least incrementally address the problem. One, sponsored by Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, would provide tax credits for the health insurance expenses of individuals, families and small businesses; allow small businesses to take a tax deduction for the full cost of their premiums; and allow states to cover low-income parents and legal immigrants under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, know as CHIP. The bill would also provide federal money to the states to establish insurance purchasing cooperatives for small businesses and high-risk pools for people who cannot get insurance in the private market because of chronic illnesses.
As Congress debates, however, employers and workers continue to struggle with higher costs and more difficult access to health care.
Mitch Flinchum, the controller at a highway paving company in Burlington, N.C., sees the problems from both ends -- as an executive in charge of benefits and as a consumer.
Mr. Flinchum pays more than 10 percent of his $65,000 annual salary for health insurance for his family, but he considers himself better off than most of his company's 350 workers. Only 119 of the employees accept the coverage, and two-thirds of those pay only for themselves and not their dependents. Mr. Flinchum says most of the workers who decline insurance do so because the premiums are costly and the coverage is so meager.
"When you look at your benefits, you've got massive deductibles, massive co-pays, and unless you have a heart attack or cancer, which would be devastating in itself, it's like you don't have any insurance," he said.
"I don't know where it stops," Mr. Flinchum added. "With a 20 percent increase each year, over time the only two people in this country who will be able to have health insurance are Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. No one else can afford it."

HEADLINE: The Smallest and the Neediest 

 BODY:
For more than a million children in New York, the approaching holidays are less a cause for joy than a reminder that misery doesn't change with the seasons. These are children who live in poverty and constant need. Many have parents who are in their lives and working, but at wages that cannot meet the cost of living. That's when basics like food and shelter become uncertainties, when every day is about living precariously. 
 It's hard enough for an adult to cope in such circumstances, but for a child the consequences can be disastrous. Going to bed hungry and heading off to school without breakfast means there is literally no food for thought for these young people. Poor nutrition exacts more than a physical price. 
 So far this year, soup kitchens and food pantries around the city, some located in the shadow of wealthy neighborhoods, report that 84,000 children have been turned away because the larders had already been emptied by others in need. That represents a 218 percent increase in two years, and it points to the chronic condition that hunger has become for a growing number of young people.
This week, some of these children will get a taste of holiday cheer at Thanksgiving meals provided by agencies like the Children's Aid Society, which will serve 10,000 turkey dinners around the city on Wednesday night. It and other organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund will feed as many as they can this Thanksgiving. But there isn't enough food to give everyone a place at the table. Philip Coltoff, executive director of the Children's Aid Society, said one goal of the Neediest Cases Fund is to change that before year's end. "We can turn this around as early as this Christmas season," he said. "We can double or triple the number of families receiving our help."
In the 90-year history of the fund, the generosity of New Yorkers has improved lives for many people, including the smallest of the neediest. This is a particularly trying time, reflecting the recession and the aftereffects of 9/11. More help is needed from those who can afford to contribute. Your donation to the fund may be made by check to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn 11245.

HEADLINE: Leftist, a Former Coup Leader, Heads for Victory in Ecuador 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, Nov. 24 

 BODY:
Lucio Edwin Gutierrez, a former army colonel who briefly took power in a coup almost three years ago, was the clear winner of Ecuador's presidential election today after promising to root out corruption and give voice to the poor.
 Mr. Gutierrez, 45, had 54 percent of the vote to 46 percent for his adversary, Alvaro Noboa, 52, a banana tycoon who spent handsomely to try to cast himself as a populist. 
 The victory for Mr. Gutierrez, a career military man with no other experience in public office, was seen as a reflection of widespread discontent with traditional politicians, who are viewed by many as corrupt purveyors of a status quo that favors special interests at the expense of most Ecuadoreans. 
"Ecuador can begin to convert itself into a more just country, a more honest country, a country with a better living standard and a country that is authentically democratic," Mr. Gutierrez told a television interviewer this evening.
Mr. Gutierrez is the latest politician to benefit from the disenchantment many Latin Americans have with traditional political parties that followed free-market prescriptions pushed by the United States and multinational lending agencies. Most countries in Latin America have seen little tangible benefit from these steps, with poverty rising and living standards falling.
In Brazil, a former labor leader, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, won election last month, and in Bolivia and Peru populist, left-leaning movements surged in recent elections.
"He and other leftist candidates in Latin America see the leftist populist position as the place to be," said Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington-based policy analysis group. "That orientation is no longer exotic. It has become mainstream for Latin America."
Mr. Gutierrez survived a late surge by Mr. Noboa, who saturated the airwaves with commercials that depicted his opponent as a dangerous radical. In all, Mr. Noboa spent more than $1 million on media advertisements, $800,000 more than permitted. Mr. Gutierrez also overspent, but by $56,000.
Mr. Noboa, who inherited one of Latin America's great fortunes and is considered the richest man in Ecuador, portrayed himself as a populist friend of the underclass. But he has been accused of employing children and mistreating workers on his banana farms, and analysts said his plans for governing had remained unclear.
"Noboa left more doubts than Gutierrez," said Simon Pachano, a political analyst at the Latin American Faculty on Social Sciences in Quito. "There was a lack of confidence with Noboa." 
With his dark skin and features indicating some Indian heritage, Mr. Gutierrez struck a chord in a country where a small minority of white businessmen and politicians have always ruled. 
"He will help the poor," said Marco Binicio, 30, a graphic designer, who voted today in the city center. "He says why give more to those who already have?" 
Mr. Gutierrez began an aggressive campaign two years ago to reach out to Ecuador's Indians, its trade unions and left-wing parties. His strategy was to cast himself as a patriot and corruption fighter speaking out for the 60 percent of Ecuadoreans who live in poverty.
"We started in my old car, three or four people, running around Ecuador, eating in the car, sleeping in the car," he said today. "Little by little, we began to reach people." 
Mr. Guttierez, a former pentathlete who entered the military academy at 15, started down the path of the classic Latin American strongman. Leading a group of military officers who joined an Indian uprising in 2000, Mr. Gutierrez became the most visible leader in the coup that toppled President Jamil Mahuad, whose administration was reviled as indecisive, inefficient and corrupt. Mr. Mahuad's democratically elected predecessor was removed from office.
Mr. Gutierrez was part of a three-man junta that lasted only a few hours before being dissolved and the vice president, Gustavo Naboa, took over, many here believe under pressure from the United States. Mr. Gutierrez was promptly jailed, but on his release a few months later formed a political party, the Jan. 21 Patriotic Society, named after the date of Mr. Mahuad's overthrow. 
In its manifesto, the party promises "war to the death" on corruption, to look for an alternative to the dollar, which became the official currency in 2000, and to reconsider ways to pay the foreign debt without affecting social programs.
Yet Mr. Gutierrez's statements, particularly since finishing first among 11 candidates in the first round of voting on Oct. 20, has shifted to the political center. With investors jittery about his first-round victory, he traveled to the United States last month to meet with economists and officials of multinational lending agencies.
"The next government will not be an Indian government or a government of the left," said Mr. Pachano, the political analyst.
"The challenge is to make a government that can govern and have accords with the Congress. Without those deals with Congress, he is not going anywhere."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE SEARCH; 
ARMS INSPECTIONS ARE SET TO BEGIN AT SITES IN IRAQ

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 

 BODY:
The campaign to eliminate Iraq's most deadly weapons officially begins on Monday, when 18 United Nations inspectors are scheduled to arrive in Baghdad toting thick dossiers on hundreds of potential weapons sites, from warehouses to clinics to breweries to petrochemical plants.
 The team plans to make its first inspection on Wednesday, when it will scour an undisclosed site for tell-tale equipment, chemicals and documents that could provide clues that Iraq has rekindled covert biological, chemical and nuclear programs since 1998, when United Nations inspectors last withdrew. 
 The initial searches will probably involve well-known sites long associated with Iraq's weapons programs, and are expected to be essentially warm-up exercises unlikely to produce confrontations or much evidence, according to United Nations officials and other arms control experts. 
But in the coming weeks, the inspections will become increasingly aggressive and less predictable as the team gains experience, expands its fleet of jeeps and German helicopters and grows to its full size: 80 to 100 people by the end of the year. The team is led by Hans Blix, an experienced veteran of inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, but includes many people with less experience, including some who have never been to Iraq before. 
"I think Blix is under immense, quiet pressure from the United States," said Anthony Cordesman, an Iraq expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
"If he doesn't go to core inspection areas quickly, he understands he will be in a quiet confrontation with the United States," Mr. Cordesman said.
What concerns American and United Nations officials most are two potential Iraqi innovations for hiding weapons: mobile biological weapons labs and underground or urban facilities for chemical and nuclear weapons.
Weapons experts say the new urban sites are probably housed in ordinary-looking warehouses and commercial buildings in densely populated areas, where they would be harder to detect by spy satellites and somewhat shielded from American bombs.
"It would be like something from 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,' where you go in a plain storefront and suddenly find yourself in a weapons lab," said David Albright, a former nuclear weapons inspector who is president of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, referring to the 1960's television spy series.
The inspectors will be following a three-part strategy, former inspectors and United Nations officials say. First, they will search for clear evidence of weapons production that could lead directly to charges that Iraq is in "material breach" of United Nations Resolution 1441 requiring it to disarm.
But given President Saddam Hussein's expertise at hiding weapons, officials say it is more likely that violations will be documented incrementally, through painstaking detective work that could take months.
To that end, inspectors will be meticulously documenting two other types of evidence: patterns of deceit and attempts to obstruct inspections. These could range from disabling jeeps to destroying documents to refusing to account for weapons materials that inspectors are certain exist.
"The strategy is to come up with a dossier of deception," said Dr. Raymond A. Zilinskas, a former United Nations weapons inspector who is now with the Monterey Institute for International Studies in California.
A crucial point will come on Dec. 8, when Iraq is required to produce a comprehensive list of all its weapons sites and dual-use installations: industrial plants, agricultural sites, medical labs and research centers that could have both civilian and military uses. Iraq has hundreds, possibly thousands, of such sites.
The declaration must also account for weapons materials that inspectors had documented before 1998: hundreds of artillery shells potentially filled with mustard gas, Scud missiles capable of carrying chemical or biological warheads, hundreds of tons of poison gases, and seed stock for biological agents like anthrax or botulinum toxin.
"The declaration will be huge," said Gustavo Zlauvinen, the New York representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which will handle the nuclear weapons inspections. "It will take weeks to get through."
The declaration will immediately be sent to New York, where a team of 17 analysts will begin checking it against a vast archive containing a million pages of procurement records, blueprints, satellite photos and intelligence cables compiled over the last decade.
"If the declaration is patently false and everybody can see it," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said on Thursday, "if he does not let the inspectors do their job, then the president is fully ready to take the necessary step, which is military force."
Another important task for the inspectors will be to interview Iraqi scientists and search for defectors. One such defector helped inspectors discover and nearly dismantle Iraq's nuclear weapons program in 1991. Many experts say the more bellicose the United States is about an invasion, the greater the likelihood of high-level defections.
"I don't think the inspectors have an idea where to look for these things," said Kelly Motz, editor of Iraq Watch, an arms control group.
"Predators and satellites are great," Ms. Motz said, referring to pilotless drones, "but you need people inside buildings." 
With an economy that is heavily reliant on the petrochemical industry, Iraq has a large number of dual-use plants that could be involved in manufacturing chemical weapons. Typical of them is Fallujah II, a major producer of precursor agents for blister and nerve gases before the Persian Gulf war in 1991. The plant, northwest of Baghdad, has been upgraded in the last two years and production of chlorine and phenol, which also have civilian uses, has increased, Western intelligence officials say.
Tracking Iraq's nuclear weapons sites is considered less complicated because of the radioactivity they emit and because the United Nations compiled a detailed picture of Iraq's program in the early 1990's.
Since then, Western intelligence agencies believe that Iraq has reconstituted its program and tried to purchase specialized aluminum tubes that could be used for enriching uranium. Some experts, however, think the tubes are for benign purposes.
Inspectors are likely to check nuclear research centers at Tuwaitha and Al Furat, where construction work has been detected and which might be hiding gas centrifuge equipment for enriching uranium, Western officials assert. They will also inspect nuclear medicine clinics to account for radioactive materials that could be used in dirty bombs.
"It's much easier to detect nuclear signatures," said Mr. Zlauvinen of the atomic energy agency.
Biological weapons materials are another matter, because they can be smaller, harder to detect and easier to move. Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld warned this year that Iraq had created mobile biological labs that would be difficult to bomb.
Major sites historically involved in biological weapons production include Al Dawrah Foot and Mouth Disease Vaccine Facility, which was recently renovated, and the castor oil production plant at Fallujah III, which can be used to produce ricin toxin.
Western intelligence officials also say Iraq's efforts to develop missiles capable of traveling from 600 to 1,000 kilometers, or about 400 to 600 miles, have been reinvigorated. Under previous United Nations resolutions, Iraq is only allowed missiles with ranges under 150 kilometers, or about 90 miles.
British and American intelligence agencies have recently released satellite photos showing construction at two sites that might be used for building and testing longer range missiles: Al Mamoun solid rocket motor production plant and Al Rafah/Shahiyat liquid propellant test site.
At some point, the inspectors will also try to search eight so-called presidential palaces. Iraq had placed restrictions on the inspectors' access to the palaces. These are huge complexes, each with official residences, Republican Guard barracks and dozens, even hundreds, of support buildings. Mr. Hussein also has direct control of dozens of smaller office buildings and complexes that are on the inspectors' list. 
Many experts said they would be surprised if inspectors found much clear evidence of prohibited activity at these or other well-known weapons sites -- precisely because they are well known. 
But the mere effort to gain access to the palaces could create confrontations that would fuel the Bush administration's argument for military action. Iraq has suggested in letters to the United Nations that it expects inspectors to show respect for its "security, independence and sovereignty," which some experts consider code words for restricting access to the palaces.
"This was never about purely marble palaces," said Ewan Buchanan, the spokesman for the United Nations inspection team. "It is about Iraq trying to put sites out of bounds. But there are no sanctuaries in Iraq. All of Iraq is open to inspections."

A12) Chart: "Sites of Interest for Weapons Inspectors"Some sites used by Iraqs weapons programs before the Persian Gulf war have been reconstructed or upgraded. Other sites, like the presidential palaces, have never been subjected to serious scrutiny. Both kinds of sites, examples of which are below, will be visited when U.N. inspectors resume work in Iraq. FALLUJAH II suspected chemical weapons siteA complex that produced a range of chemical weapons precursors, Fallujah II was largely disabled by gulf war bombing and U.N. inspections. The complex has been repaired, increasing output of chlorine, a major chemical weapon precursor that also has many legitimate civilian uses. FALLUJAH III suspected biological weapons siteA factory complex not yet complete at the time of the gulf war, Fallujah III now includes a castor oil plant that the C.I.A. says could be used to make ricin toxin. Ricin, derived from the castor bean, is a powerful toxin that can be fatal when inhaled, injected or eaten. MOSUL PRESIDENTIAL PALACEThe presidential palace at Mosul was one of eight palaces that Iraq declared sovereign and off limits to U.N. inspectors in 1997.

U.N. Weapons Inspectors Set to Begin in Iraq
United Nations inspectors are scheduled to arrive today in Baghdad. The team plans to make its first inspection on Wednesday, when it will begin scouring for telltale equipment, chemicals and documents that could provide clues that Iraq has rekindled covert biological, chemical or nuclear programs. A1

The United States is forging an alliance of convenience with a Shiite cleric who has been living in Iran as the effort goes forward to try to unseat Saddam Hussein. Much of Baghdad is populated by Shiites and Shiites dominate southern Iraq, the principal invasion route that American forces would take in Iraq. A1

New Lebanon Religious Rift
The death of an American missionary who was killed while working in a prenatal clinic in Lebanon exposes a violent crosscurrent in the gulf between the Middle East and the West, aggravated by a renewed effort by missionaries from the United States to spread Christianity to Muslims. A1

Islamic Attack in Kashmir
Islamic militants attacked a Hindu temple complex in Kashmir, killing at least 10 people and wounding more than 40. Three of the assailants were killed. Along with other recent attacks, the violence suggests a renewed determination by militants to pursue their drive for secession from India. A11

Query on U.N. Worker's Death
A United Nations investigator arrived in Jerusalem to investigate the fatal shooting of a British United Nations worker by an Israeli soldier. Separately, the Israeli Army said it found documents showing that officials of the Palestinian Authority wanted to build a factory to make nitric acid for use in explosives. A10

Fears of Indonesia Attacks
Western governments are bracing for more attacks on their citizens in Indonesia. The investigation into the Bali bombing last month has led to increasing alarm because it has shown that there is a terrorist network in Indonesia that is more deeply entrenched and capable than had been suspected. A13

Korean Candidate Bows Out
The presidential campaign in South Korea was transformed into a contest between right and left with the withdrawal of a popular political figure. Neither left-wing candidate had a chance of defeating the conservative, Lee Hoi Chang, if both of them stayed in the race. A6

Hundreds Flee Nigerian City
Hundreds of people fled the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna after days of religious violence over the Miss World pageant that killed more than 200 people. A6

Centrist Austrian Victory
Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel and his center-right People's Party were the victors in Austria's national elections, winning the party's largest plurality in 36 years and ensuring, for the time being, a continuation of a government focused on tax cuts, privatization and integration into the European Union. A3

Loss of Health Benefits Reaches the Middle Class
The Census Bureau reports that 1.4 million Americans lost their health insurance last year. The health care crisis, once thought to be a problem chiefly of the poor and the unemployed, is spreading up the income ladder into the ranks of those with full-time jobs. A1

Historic Ledger Is Rescued
The original accounting book of the Senate, misplaced and forgotten, was almost lost in an effort to modernize the building. The Senate historian's office said workers noticed the aged volume and called Congressional curators, who rescued it and other record books. A1

A Call for a Warning System
A panel that includes some of the government's leading emergency managers recommended the creation of a high-technology national warning system that would alert the public to emergencies. The system would be the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security. A13

Both Sides Hail Port Agreement
The tentative contract between West Coast port operators and longshoremen achieved major gains for both sides and was likely to ensure six years of labor peace. The dispute has closed 29 ports and threatened to derail the economy. A14

G.O.P. Charts a Course
Republican governors and senior strategists gathered in California to talk about their Election Day successes. But they also discussed the complications that come with their newfound power in Congress and in governor's offices nationwide. A18

HEADLINE: More Furrowed Brows. Is a Double Dip Ahead? 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
It is not foolproof, but the Anxious Index has provided a new reason to worry about a double-dip recession.
 The index -- which measures forecasters' opinions on whether the economy will soon start shrinking -- rose to 24.1 in the current quarter, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said on Friday. Over the summer, it was 18.6. 
 When the index has reached the mid-20's in past years, a recession has followed roughly half of the time.
"It's a little bit worrisome," said Dean Croushore, an economist at the Philadelphia Fed. "The data for the last three months, and even the last six months, have been weaker than the forecasters expected."
Wall Street forecasters tend to make overly optimistic predictions, and almost all failed to foresee last year's recession. But their doubts about their own forecasts, measured by the Fed's survey, have been an unusually good economic indicator.
When forecasters say that there is a 30 percent chance, on average, of the economy's shrinking in the following quarter, a recession usually ensues. 
The survey began in 1968, and the Philadelphia Fed began using the term Anxious Index after it appeared in The New York Times this year. 
The index exceeded 20 before the 1990-91 recession and before the second of two successive downturns in the early 1980's. But it also reached that level in 1992, when the economy was beginning its longest expansion on record, and in the mid-80's, when it avoided recession.
The index's jump "is not insignificant, but it doesn't mean it's inevitable" Mr. Croushore said, referring to a new downturn. 
The most recent recession began in March of last year, according to a committee of academic economists. The committee has not yet announced when the recession ended, but it is likely to choose a month around the beginning of this year.
Since the Fed conducted the most recent survey, in early November, the economy has appeared to improve somewhat, with stocks rising and claims for unemployment insurance falling.
Forecasters also said that the unemployment rate would remain at about 5.8 percent early next year and fall to 5.6 percent during the second half of the year. They said that the economy would grow 2.6 percent, down from a previous estimate of 3 percent, and that inflation would remain mild over the next decade.
Federal Reserve officials are slightly more optimistic, according to recent comments by Alan Greenspan, the chairman, and others. A recent survey by a business group showed corporate executives to be more downbeat.
Full results of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's survey are available at www.phil.frb.org/econ/spf/index.html.

HEADLINE: Both Sides See Gains in Deal To End Port Labor Dispute 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The tentative contract that West Coast port operators and longshoremen announced early yesterday achieves major gains for both sides and is likely to ensure six years of labor peace after a dispute that closed 29 ports and threatened to derail the economy.
 The deal gives the West Coast's 10,500 longshoremen large pension increases and gives the port operators and shipping lines permission to use far-reaching technologies to speed cargo handling. 
 The White House announced the accord shortly after 1 a.m. yesterday, ending a dispute that had closed the ports for 11 days before President Bush obtained an injunction to reopen them last month. 
"This agreement is good for workers, good for employers, and it's good for America's economy," Mr. Bush said in a statement the White House issued as the union and port operators were signing an agreement in San Francisco. 
Before yesterday's announcement, the dispute had threatened to close the West Coast ports on Dec. 27, when the 80-day injunction reopening the ports was to expire. Among shipping companies, factories and retailers, there was widespread fear that the International Longshore and Warehouse Union would begin a strike soon after Christmas if there was no accord by the time the cooling-off period ended. 
The pension issue was one of the last ones settled, officials involved in the negotiations said. Under the agreement, reached after more than a month of negotiations in San Francisco, longshoremen's pensions will rise by almost 60 percent, the officials said. A longshoreman with 30 years' experience will be able to retire with an annual pension of $54,000, compared with the current $34,200.
Several labor analysts said the union had pressured management to grant large pension increases in exchange for the union's agreeing to accept new technologies expected to eliminate the jobs of more than 400 marine clerks who keep track of cargo. Under the agreement, management promised not to lay off any of those clerks, and to find other jobs for them. 
The wage increases in the package are more modest than the pension increases. The longshoremen's basic wage, $27.50 an hour, will rise by $3 an hour, or almost 11 percent, over six years. With premiums, night differentials and overtime added, longshoremen now earn nearly $100,000 a year on average.
On Sept. 29, the port operators and shipping lines closed ports from San Diego to Seattle and locked out the 10,500 longshoremen, contending that the union was engaged in a slowdown, which the union denied. With some economists estimating damage to the economy of $1 billion a day, the lockout caused some factories to close, some perishable cargo to rot and many retailers to worry about inventory shortages.
Concluding that the shutdown was endangering the nation's economy and security, President Bush invoked the Taft-Hartley Act on Oct. 8 to obtain an injunction reopening the ports.
Many corporations hailed the injunction, saying it would save the economy from grievous damage. But the longshoremen and many other labor unions condemned it, saying it constituted improper government meddling.
Peter J. Hurtgen, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, was in San Francisco for much of the last month, working with the two sides to reach an agreement. 
"The fact that it is for six years provides stability for the nation," Mr. Hurtgen said. "We don't have to worry about shutdowns and slowdowns at the ports."
On Nov. 1, the union and the port operators announced an agreement on the main issue that had divided them: the introduction of computer technologies to track cargo. 
Under the agreement, management will gain far more flexibility to introduce new technologies and the union will maintain jurisdiction over many jobs it feared would become nonunion, officials involved in the negotiations said.
The technologies that management gained permission to introduce include optical scanners, remote cameras and geopositioning satellites. These tools will make it easier to read the manifests of trucks carrying cargo into the ports and to keep track of containers in ports and on the high seas. 
"This tentative agreement provides additional tools to bring our ports into the 21st century and enhance the West Coast's competitive standing in the world," said Joseph Miniace, president of the Pacific Maritime Association, a group of 80 port operators and shipping companies.
After years of bitter relations, both sides said they hoped to develop a more cooperative and trusting relationship.
"This landmark agreement is a victory for longshore workers and their families, and a win-win for business, labor and our national economy," said James Spinosa, the union's president. 
To settle another difficult issue, the naming of a new arbitrator for longshore disputes, the two sides agreed to name John Kagel, a longtime arbitrator, to replace his father, Samuel Kagel. The elder Kagel, who will soon retire, has been the longshoremen's main arbitrator for more than four decades.
Union officials said 100 rank-and-file longshoremen would meet at a caucus on Dec. 9 to consider the agreement. Then, after the pact is described to all union members, they will vote on it in a secret ballot.

HEADLINE: For Sale, a Brooklyn Building With a Past 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Building for Sale: Downtown Brooklyn. Retail/Residential/Mixed use. McKim, Mead & White building. Famed address. Price Negotiable. Contact: Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
 Mayor Bloomberg is planning to announce today that the city will restart its efforts to sell 110 Livingston Street, the much-maligned, almost infamous headquarters of the now-defunct Board of Education, an administration official said yesterday. 
 The mayor is set to make the announcement when he addresses the New York City Economic Development Summit this morning in downtown Brooklyn, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official said that the benefits of the sale would be threefold: the city would stand to make tens of millions of badly needed dollars, probably in 2005; the sale would underscore the transformation of the city's education bureaucracy; and making 110 Livingston Street a mixed-use building would continue to spur the development of downtown Brooklyn.
The sale was first proposed two years ago by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who earlier had famously called for the school system to be "blown up." The city had originally planned to sell 110 Livingston Street, along with two nearby buildings that also house education officials, 131 Livingston Street and 65 Court Street. Now the city is planning to sell just 110 Livingston Street, and, separately, the Brooklyn Heights town house where the city used to house its schools chancellors.
The current chancellor, Joel I. Klein, decided against living in the town house and agreed to forgo a housing stipend, the official said.
Now that the mayor has won control of the school system, renamed it the Department of Education and moved most of the administrators who once worked at 110 Livingston Street to the old Tweed Courthouse in the backyard of City Hall, the official said that it would be much easier to move ahead with the sale.
The building was constructed in 1926 by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White as a lodge for the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks and was taken over by the Board of Education in 1939. 
Diane Ravitch, a professor of education at New York University, said that historically, 110 Livingston "represented the worst excesses of bureaucracy."
"It symbolically stood for the unfeeling, insensitive, top-down, initiative-smothering bureaucracy that was at the center of the great school wars of the 1960's that led to decentralization," she said.
"I think there's probably some symbolic value to selling it," she added. "But a cooler head might suggest that they keep it to use as a conference and training center. The department hires out space for that at hotels around the city at great cost."
Even with the Department of Education's move to the Tweed Courthouse, which was renovated at a cost of $89 million, there are still plenty of education officials working in downtown Brooklyn. 
Before the move to the courthouse, the administration official said, 800 to 900 people worked at 110 Livingston Street, and another 900 education workers were in the two nearby buildings. All told, about 600 people who worked at Livingston Street were relocated to the Tweed Courthouse. Those who remained at 110 Livingston Street have been joined by officials from the school safety division, while others have been relocated to the other two buildings.
From 200 to 300 people still work at 110 Livingston, the official said.
When the building was an Elks lodge, it featured a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a bowling alley and handball courts. Some of those who had once had their offices at 110 Livingston said that the building -- which has 12 stories and a garret -- should be an attractive property for developers.
"It's not an unattractive, speculative type of building," said Dr. Frank J. Macchiarola, who was chancellor from 1978 to 1983. 
Dr. Macchiarola, who is now the president of St. Francis College in Brooklyn, said that he was not sure if its well-known address would be a bonus or a drawback. "When I was chancellor, I actually toyed with the idea of changing the address to 112 Livingston Street," he said, adding that he had been thinking of getting an apartment closer to work. "To think of being back at 110 Livingston Street. . . ." he mused.

HEADLINE: Finding Little Fat to Trim, the Business Mayor Sees His City as Pretty Well Run 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
For years, the refrain has been the same: if only government were run like a business. Then, last year, New Yorkers elected Michael R. Bloomberg, a wealthy, shrewd businessman with no experience in elected office, to take the reins of city government and put his private-sector managerial skills to work in the public sector.
 But so far the wholesale changes in the way New York City operates that some people longed for and others feared -- corporate-scale downsizing, merger mania among city agencies or the privatization of many city services -- have not come to pass. 
 Instead, when the businessman-turned-mayor went to City Hall, he surveyed the government he now led and decided that it was, well, pretty efficient. That assessment underpins his approach to plugging the city's gaping deficit with more money from higher taxes, including an 18 percent increase in the property tax rate, than from service cuts. Further cuts, he argues, would harm core services. 
"You can't just say let's go cut out corruption, waste and the meaningless programs," the mayor said earlier this month when he unveiled his latest budget proposal, "because fundamentally, they're not there."
All of which raises a question: Is New York City government really efficient?
Studies consistently put the city's tax burden as one of the highest among the nation's big cities. The city work force, by Mayor Bloomberg's own reckoning, is now one-seventh the size of the federal government's, without the military. Many city employees work 35 hours a week by contract. And police and fire protection cost more in New York than in many other large cities.
Many fiscal analysts agree that some waste and inefficiency are inevitable in a government as large as New York's. But they say that the city has grown better managed and more professional since the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. The question of just how much waste remains, and how to eliminate it, provokes debate among city officials, budget analysts and political scientists.
"Fat in the government is not like fat on a chicken; it's like fat in a steak," is the culinary simile often used by Don Mele, a vice president for government affairs at the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce, a business organization. "It's marbled through."
Assessing its efficiency is not always easy, though, because government is not a profit-driven, bottom-line kind of enterprise, but an attempt to deliver the best city services, and help the neediest citizens, without overburdening the taxpayers, who must foot the bill.
Take the city's garbage program. Closing the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island, which had 20 years' capacity remaining, left the city laboriously hauling 11,000 tons of garbage out of state each day, a truck at a time, for an extra cost of about $200 million a year. That decision was driven not by the city's ledger sheet, but by a political choice to help the residents of Staten Island get rid of their dump. The Bloomberg administration's plan to eventually float the garbage away by barge may be better for the environment, but no cheaper.
"What may sound most efficient is not necessarily best," said Steven A. Cohen, a professor of public administration at Columbia University. "In the classroom, we like class size at a certain level. It would be a lot more efficient if we only taught to the test, and had classes of 100. But that is not what most people would want for their children."
That kind of conscious political or policy decision aside, fiscal analysts say, areas of waste and inefficiency persist. Consider the workload. While few people would argue that most city workers are overpaid, some fiscal analysts -- and, increasingly, officials at City Hall -- are questioning the amount of time city workers spend at work. 
Most of the city government's civilian work force works only 35 hours a week, which is not only less than in business but less than for state workers, who work 37.5 hours a week, and federal employees, who work 40 hours a week. City workers get 12 paid holidays a year, while private workers get an average of 9, according to federal labor statistics.
The Citizens Budget Commission, a budget watchdog group financed by the city's business community, is preparing to release a report estimating that if all city workers not working 40-hour weeks were required to do so, the city could potentially eliminate 8,500 positions and save $498 million a year while getting the same amount of work done.
In some agencies, budget analysts say, the problem is that the workdays are too long. Police officers work 8 hours and 35 minutes a day, with the extra time for getting in and out of uniform and roll call. But police officers get to work 18 fewer shifts a year to make up for the extra time. When vacation, holidays and sick leave are factored in, that means many officers with five years' experience work only about 200 days a year, not counting overtime.
The Bloomberg administration says that it will look for productivity savings next year when it negotiates with the unions, who guard work rules jealously. But the past shows that such negotiation may not be easy: during the last set of contract negotiations with the police union, the Bloomberg administration proposed shortening officers' shifts by 20 minutes and giving them larger raises in exchange for making them work an extra 10 days each year. The police union opposed the plan, and a state arbitration panel granted officers a smaller raise, with the same work schedule.
Paid sabbaticals for city teachers have come under scrutiny as well. Teachers with 14 years of service are entitled to one-year sabbaticals for study or "restoration of health," with 70 percent of their pay plus their regular benefits. Eliminating the practice would save the city about $74 million a year, but could make teacher recruitment more difficult, the Independent Budget Office recently estimated.
Some incentives -- like shorter workweeks, good vacation packages and sabbaticals -- help the city recruit better candidates for jobs with salaries that are not very high.
The teachers' contract that was passed this year brings the starting salary for teachers, $39,000, into line with the salaries in surrounding suburbs. But the teachers' union notes that the suburbs pay experienced teachers 8 to 15 percent more.
And before city police officers got raises totaling 11.75 percent for the last two years, bringing their starting salaries to $34,514, their union complained that they were paid 18 percent less than the national average, 45 percent less than officers on Long Island and 20 percent less than officers in Newark.
In assessing the city's efficiency, it can be compared either with itself over time or with other large cities, fiscal experts said. Neither method is ideal.
New York City has the largest local government in the nation, one that performs many services that are provided for other cities by county and state governments. "Comparing New York City to other cities in terms of what its government performs is largely a waste of time," Professor Cohen said.
He listed some things that set the city apart: it is bound by the courts to shelter the homeless, its school system educates 1.1 million children, 4 in 10 New Yorkers were born abroad and many New Yorkers need social services. Its police officers guard Wall Street and the United Nations, and now, since the World Trade Center attack, 1,000 of them are assigned to counterterrorism.
Last month the city employed 245,699 full-time workers. That figure, which comes at the end of a buyout program, is close to the average head count for the last two administrations. But it is nearly 14,000 more than the city's average over the period since 1975, when the city rapidly shed tens of thousands of jobs because of the fiscal crisis.
During Rudolph W. Giuliani's first term as mayor, the city work force shrank to 235,069, its lowest level since 1987, but by the time he left office last year, the force had grown back to 250,489, the fifth-highest level since 1975. And its composition changed: health and social service staffing shrank, while police officers and teachers increased.
Many city agencies have shrunk drastically over time. The Parks Department, for example, had 6,800 workers in 1975, falling to 4,600 in 1989 and 1,961 now. In wealthy areas, private conservancies have taken up the slack left by the shrinking work force. Critics say that small parks in poor neighborhoods have suffered, a charge parks officials deny.
Cutting workers is not easy, and does not always save as much money as it would seem, city officials say. Many jobs, they point out, are paid fully or partly by the state or federal government. So in some cases the city would stand to lose all the service without saving all the money.
Dick Netzer, a professor of economics and public administration at New York University, says he thinks the budget cuts Mayor Bloomberg has to make will be difficult. "There's just not as much waste as there used to be," he said.
Edmund J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative group that advocates lower taxes, argues that the fact that spending rose far above the rate of inflation in recent years makes it difficult to see how it could be efficient now. "At the end of an economic boom at which spending increased at the rate we saw in New York, even if it was hyper-efficient to begin with, you couldn't say it is efficient now," he said.
Charles Brecher, the director of research for the Citizens Budget Commission, says he thinks it is better to compare the city's services with those of other large cities. His group compared the cost of police and fire protection in 13 of the largest cities in the United States in 1999.
Per capita, he found, New York City was fourth in spending on police and fire protection. "There are tremendous opportunities to run city government more efficiently," he said. "The habit of thinking of New York as unique, and the way we do things as unchangeable, causes many of our leaders to ignore these vast opportunities."
But as the administration found, it is not easy to identify cuts.
The city could find savings in many areas, but at a steep political or, possibly, public safety cost. One proposal that was floated this year, but not chosen, was to close some firehouses at night. Some neighborhoods have fewer fires at night than other neighborhoods, and less traffic, and trucks from other firehouses could still respond quickly to emergencies. But one fatal nighttime fire in a neighborhood with a closed firehouse, and the city and its leaders would be held responsible.
Similarly, although the police in many large cities routinely patrol the streets in one-person police cars, New York City officers are assigned two to a car. The police could cover more ground if the department moved to one-person cars, but safety concerns have kept the two-officer car sacrosanct. New York tested one-officer cars in 1980, but the experiment was brought to a quick end when an unaccompanied officer was shot and killed.
In the final analysis, many budget analysts said, city government is just not like business. Jacob Ukeles, a consultant who wrote the city's first Mayor's Management Report, a standard efficiency tool, when he was the executive of the mayor's management advisory board during the Beame administration, noted that most businesses do not rotate bosses every four or eight years.
"It's a democratic plus," he said, "but an operational minus."

Dark Side of Holidays: Sleep-Deprived Drivers

BYLINE:  By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
The holiday season promises to bring a serious threat to thousands of of sleep-deprived Americans -- a motor vehicle accident that could injure or kill the driver, passengers, pedestrians or people in other vehicles.
 A recent poll by the National Sleep Foundation revealed that in the past year, half of Americans said they had driven drowsy at least once, and one in five drivers admitted to falling asleep at the wheel. 
 Drowsy driving is estimated to cause about 20 percent of accidents, 1.2 million a year, more than drugs and alcohol combined. And the problem is getting worse as growing numbers of Americans become increasingly sleep-deprived in our 24/7 culture.
"There's a new definition of the shift worker," said Dr. Mark R. Rosekind, president of Alertness Solutions, a California-based company that provides advice and training on fatigue management. 
"Every segment of our culture is now working round the clock: health care, transportation, public safety, technology, economics and banking, convenience stores and gas stations," Dr. Rosekind said. "People are getting less and less sleep and their body clocks are more disrupted. Drowsy driving is the consequence."
Now add to the day-to-day sleep disrupters the demands of holiday preparations and activities, like shopping, cooking, cleaning, traveling, dinners and parties with heavy meals and alcohol, and you have a recipe for disaster behind the wheel.
The combination of drowsiness with just one alcoholic drink can impair driving skills as much as four drinks will. With the typical college student's sleep debt, one beer has the impairing effect of a six-pack.
The problem of drowsy driving is especially risky for people 16 to 29. At a meeting last week sponsored by the foundation, Warren Mackey told how he lost his 17-year-old son, a promising basketball player, on a Sunday evening four years ago when he fell asleep at the wheel after getting only a few hours of sleep the night before. And Russell Burris told how he became paraplegic shortly after finishing high school in 1990 when he crashed his car after being awake for the previous 36 hours.
In driver education, Mr. Burris said, "I was told about the importance of a seat belt, I was warned about the dangers of drinking and driving, but no one ever mentioned what could happen if I drove while drowsy."

Signs of Trouble
"The brain is an opportunistic sleeper," said Richard Gelula, executive director of the foundation. If a person is sleep-deprived, he explained, the brain will lapse into sleep at the first sedentary chance it gets -- in front of the television, at a concert or play, while driving a motor vehicle. "Let's face it, driving is not an exciting activity for the brain," he said.
The average person needs eight or more hours of sleep a night (teenagers need nine) to be fully rested, but most Americans are lucky to get six or seven, each night adding to an accumulating sleep debt.
A study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety showed that people who slept six to seven hours a night were twice as likely to crash as those who slept eight hours or more, and people who slept less than five hours had a risk of crashing four to five times as great.
For those who must stay awake during the hours when people are biologically programmed to be sleeping, the problem is much worse. Most sleep-related crashes occur from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., with a second peak in midafternoon, the traditional siesta time. Even if drowsy drivers do not fall asleep, alertness is greatly diminished, reaction time is much slower and the chance of causing accidents is greatly increased.
How can you tell if you are too tired to drive safely? First, assess your likelihood of dozing off under these circumstances: while sitting and reading, watching television, sitting inactive in a public place like a theater or a meeting, sitting quietly after a lunch without alcohol or riding as a passenger in a car for a hour.
The more often you fall asleep when you are supposed to be awake, the sleepier your brain is and the greater the chance of dozing off behind the wheel.
There are also telltale signs of impending sleep while driving, though many drivers are either unaware of them or choose to ignore them. They include repeated yawning, a sensation of heavy eyelids, difficulty focusing your eyes, trouble keeping your head up, daydreaming or having disconnected thoughts, drifting over the center line or too close to the edge of the road, inability to remember the last few miles, missing traffic signs or finding yourself tailgating.
To make matters worse, sometimes sleep can strike without warning. Drivers who live to tell the tale often report that they did not know they were about to fall asleep; it just happened.
At 60 miles an hour, in just a three-second doze, you will travel the length of a football field -- far enough to run off the road or crash into a barricade or another vehicle.
Just such an accident killed a young woman and her five passengers when a trucker traveling at 65 miles an hour fell asleep and struck her station wagon. The trucker, who also died in the crash, had routinely cheated on his log and had been driving for 20 hours when the accident occurred.

What to Do
First and foremost, stop cheating on your sleep. Before starting out on a trip, be sure to get a full night's sleep. Plan ahead so that you're not up late getting ready to leave. Don't start out at night for a drive that will run into your usual bedtime hours or arise earlier than usual to get a head start.
On a long trip it is best to have at least two drivers who can take turns. A third person in the car who will stay awake and talk to the driver is even better. Especially if you are the only driver, take frequent breaks; at least once every two hours or 100 miles, pull off the road and walk around briskly for a while.
Avoid eating a big meal or one loaded with carbohydrates before driving. Instead, bring along light, preferably protein-rich snacks and nonsugary drinks to stave off hunger. Don't wear anything tight around your waist; instead put a hefty dose of caffeine under your belt.
But if you ordinarily consume lots of caffeine, you may be tolerant to its stimulant effect. Best to save this drug for when it is most needed. Also note that it takes 15 to 20 minutes for the caffeine you drink to reach your brain, so don't wait until you are beginning to feel sleepy. 
Listen to informational or conversational programs or, better yet, play recordings of interesting books when driving monotonous roads. I've also found it helpful, especially on solo drives, to play music I can sing along with.
If you note the telltale signs of sleepiness, the best solution is to pull off the road into a safe area as soon as possible and take a nap. Bring along a kitchen timer or set your watch to awaken you in 20 minutes.
A longer sleep is more effective in the long run but can cause sleep inertia, necessitating about 15 minutes of physical activity and a cup of coffee to restore your alertness.
If it is not possible or safe to stop for a nap, two cups of coffee (or their caffeine equivalent of 300 milligrams) can keep you alert for about three hours if you are not tolerant.

HIGH AND MIGHTY
S.U.V.'s: The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way
By Keith Bradsher
Illustrated. 468 pages. Public Affairs. $28.
 This is one of the best books on American politics I have read recently, although it's supposed to be about cars. Actually it's about "light trucks," one of the many twists in the story of the sport utility vehicle and its dubious rise on the streets. 
 Pass, say, a Ford Explorer on the roadway, and you might say, "Wow, that's a big car," but you won't say, "That's a neat truck." According to the federal government, however, the Explorer is a truck. It's a truck for purposes of the Clean Air Act of 1990, passed by Congress to update the laws limiting smog-causing emissions. The act has less-stringent limits for trucks (local contractors need them for work, you see), so getting S.U.V.'s classified as trucks is a political feat worth quite a bit to the auto industry. It's also a tricky class maneuver, since the exemption's benefits are passing from working class to more affluent Americans.
Thus the Explorer's pricier cousin, the Lincoln Navigator, is considered a truck for purposes of calculating the 10 percent luxury tax the 1990 Congress slapped on cars with price tags of $30,000 or more. That law, like many others, exempted "light trucks," in this case those with a gross weight over 6,000 pounds. The Navigator grew to that size as Ford added luxury features but included in the price no luxury tax because it's not a car, stupid, it's a kind of luxury truck. Thus does politics make for strange markets, even though it's true that a market is definitely there among ordinary American car buyers, a huge portion of whom have found S.U.V.'s to their liking.
That liking and the way it was coaxed forward, manipulated by the auto industry, is a further theme in Keith Bradsher's marvelously told book. Mr. Bradsher, a correspondent for The New York Times, was the paper's Detroit bureau chief from 1996 to 2001. "High and Mighty" is his study in Washington politics and the ways of Detroit, but also the politics of our roadways and the social psychology of Americans as drivers. 
The S.U.V., it turns out, is a vehicle of aggression, a machine to menace other people with. It was understood and marketed that way by an auto industry that itself behaved cynically and aggressively in securing loopholes and exemptions that made the S.U.V. so fantastically profitable.
The key product line in the industry during the 1990's, S.U.V.'s helped revive the economy of the upper Midwest, including two states -- Michigan and Ohio -- that are heavily contested in presidential elections. Mr. Bradsher describes how a single Ford factory in Michigan produced $11 billion in annual S.U.V. sales (equal to the size of McDonald's global sales) and $3.7 billion in pretax profits from one factory.
This would all make for a routine story of sky-high success were it not that S.U.V.'s are more dangerous in some collisions than other cars, tend to roll over more, pollute the air more, get worse gas mileage and effectively undo much of the legislation Congress passed to force innovation on these things. Mr. Bradsher calls S.U.V.'s the world's most dangerous vehicles (and cites data to prove it), but it would be equally accurate to say it's the most antisocial.
One of the attractions, after all, is the driver gets perched above other cars. Looking down on passing traffic gives some illusion of highway command. The machines are actually "tippy monstrosities with mediocre brakes that block other drivers' view of the road and inflict massive damage during collisions."
Consider four-wheel drive, a defining feature of S.U.V.'s and their advertisements. It's superfluous, a fake attraction. "All of the S.U.V. market was psychological, there was no actual customer need for four-wheel drive," says William R. Chapin, former American Motors Company executive who was a senior marketer of Jeep, the brand from which all S.U.V.'s descend. 
Jeep, now owned by Chrysler, dates from America's industrial ramp up before World War II. It was the cheap, boxy, utilitarian vehicle the Army needed then. The Jeep's descendant, the S.U.V., appeals to affluent baby boomers who like the idea of going off road even though they will probably never do it. S.U.V. drivers are anxious about safety, but Detroit has conned them into thinking that a bigger, heavier, taller vehicle is safe because it feels strong and intimidating and looks "likely to demolish other people's cars in collisions," as Mr. Bradsher writes.
This is mostly the result of theatricality in front-end design and vehicle bulk. The Dodge Durango is supposed to look like a savage jungle cat, says a Chrysler marketing whiz, Clotaire Rapaille. "A strong animal has a big jaw, that's why we put big fenders," he says. Another Chrysler executive, David Bostwick, says the S.U.V. is "aggressive on the outside and it's the Ritz-Carlton on the inside." Menacing but comfy is the mood struck. 
Mr. Bradsher makes a crucial point when he notes that the auto industry generates very sophisticated data about Americans and their social mood, with sample sizes of 10,000 compared with 400 for many public opinion polls. He is right to zero in on the social psychology of the S.U.V. because a serious journalist has to explain how this inferior, dangerous and antisocial product surged in market share during the 1990's. Are we getting dumber? During an information revolution?
Part of the answer is politics, and not just the lobbying might of the auto industry or its unions. Mr. Bradsher openly jeers at the record of the environmental movement in sounding the alarm about S.U.V.'s and the hidden import of the light truck exemption. That watchdog failed, he says. He criticizes the press for showing up at the industry's showcase events and losing the bigger story: power politics in Washington and Detroit that delegislated the work of Congress. It was a misdirection play. The real news about cars was being written in the language of trucks, and a confluence of interests wanted it that way.
"Perhaps the saddest part of the S.U.V. boom is that it has been so unnecessary," Mr. Bradsher writes in a final chapter. The auto companies had become smarter. They had learned how to make roomy and comfortable cars with fuel-efficient, low-polluting engines. The philosopher John Dewey would have called this an intelligent state of affairs. How it came undone is Keith Bradsher's menacing story, and I think he has it cold.

HEADLINE: Turkmen Leader Unhurt in Attack by Gunman 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
A gunman opened fire today on the motorcade of President Saparmurat Niyazov of Turkmenistan in what appeared to be an assassination attempt, according to Russian and local reports.
 Mr. Niyazov, 62, escaped unharmed from the attack, which occurred this morning after two cars and a truck had blocked his motorcade in the Turkmenistan capital, Ashgabat, the reports said. Mr. Niyazov was at the wheel of his car, as is his usual practice. 
 The attempted assassination revealed a rare crack in Mr. Niyazov's near-absolute control over the Central Asian country. It seems to suggest that an undercurrent of opposition exists in a society where the government has nurtured a cult of personality around its leader, known as Akbar Turkmenbashi, the Great Leader of all Turkmen.
On national television tonight, Mr. Niyazov accused four former aides -- including two former deputy prime ministers, a former agriculture minister and a former ambassador -- of organizing the attack, the Russian news agencies Interfax and Itar-Tass reported from Ashgabat.
Mr. Niyazov has governed Turkmenistan with increasing authority since he became chairman of the Turkmen Communist Party in 1985, when the country was still a republic of the Soviet Union. He became president after independence in 1991 and has then consolidated near-dictatorial power by suppressing opponents, restricting free speech and controlling all branches of government.
There were conflicting accounts of casualties in the attack. At least one police officer was reported seriously wounded. The gunman, wielding an automatic rifle from the truck, appeared to have escaped, though Interfax reported that other suspects had been arrested.
The attack occurred on the day when Mr. Niyazov announced in a decree that his government would grant amnesty to nearly half the 17,000 prisoners in the country. He said he was acting out of "the ideals of goodness, justice, charity and strengthening the family, the foundations of the unity and cohesion of Turkmen society," Reuters reported.
The United States has repeatedly criticized Mr. Niyazov's repression of most basic freedoms. Douglas A. Davidson, the deputy American representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, recently criticized the "systematic pattern that is thwarting the development of human rights, democracy and a market economy in Turkmenistan."

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD; 
Holiday Travelers Can Look to the Web for Advice

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey 

 BODY:
TT was the Monday morning before Thanksgiving and the excitable announcer on an all-news radio station in New York was shrieking a warning about how, as we face the holiday travel season, we need to be prepared for new "homeland security measures." These measures were left unspecified in the broadcast rush to get to the foot-fungus medicine ad and the weekend football scores.
 You may have been thinking, as I was: all I want to know is what, reasonably, I might expect to encounter at the airport during the always dreaded holiday-travel season, which starts tomorrow and doesn't end till the early days of 2003. 
 A glance at the industry fare statistics would indicate that an airport crush is looming. Average domestic air fares are 18 percent below 2000 levels, according to David Swierenga, the chief economist at the Air Transport Association, the trade group for the airline industry. Adjusted for inflation, air fares have fallen 25 percent since 1991, he said. 
Some good news, from the point of view of the business traveler, if not the airline, is that those low air fares are not coaxing a huge number of additional leisure or holiday travelers out of their cars or living rooms this year. That's partly because of a soured economy and partly because of a continuing disillusionment with air travel in general. Thanksgiving air travel looks like it will be up slightly this year over last year, when traffic was off sharply. But traffic won't come close to the peak levels of 2000, industry experts predicted.
Still, as Mr. Swierenga and others point out, with the airlines flying 10 to 15 percent fewer seats than they flew in 2000, and with new security procedures and employees rushed into place at airports in recent months, it's a good idea to anticipate bottlenecks, especially at security checkpoints. Most airlines are advising passengers to be at the airport at least an hour before departure.
And business travelers going through half a dozen airports -- Detroit, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Newark, Kennedy and La Guardia -- need to be aware of a test program being conducted at those locations by the Transportation Security Administration. The usual practice of hustling to the airport club or the departure gate to pick up a boarding pass is out at certain terminals at those airports, where passengers are now required to have an actual boarding pass in hand before going through security. The program, which the T.S.A. plans to expand to other airports in 2003, is intended to consolidate security at one place and lay the groundwork for eliminating those much-despised random screenings at departure gates. 
For the whole holiday travel period, good information is available online, at individual airline Web sites and at www.tsatraveltips.us, a new site recently put up by the T.S.A., the agency that now has 44,000 white-shirted federal screeners at work at airport gates. Despite several broken links, the site has useful holiday travel information and tips. A good one is to remember not to wrap carry-on gifts, which are going to be searched -- as well as a detailed list of what can and cannot be brought onto an airplane. Contrary to general belief, incidentally, formerly banned objects like corkscrews, nail files and tweezers are now allowed in carry-on bags.
The Air Transport Association also has a holiday-travel Web site, www.customers-first.org, with useful information. 
Airports, meanwhile, are breathing more easily now that Congress and the T.S.A. have sent clear signals that the much-feared Dec. 31 deadline imposed by Congress for bomb-detection screening of all checked luggage will not be strictly enforced in airports where adequate detection equipment is not yet in place -- which includes most major airports. Some of those airports had been warning of potential four-hour backups as baggage piled up for inspection starting on New Year's Day. 
"Actually, the holiday travel season doesn't look all that bad now," said Michael Boyd, an airline industry consultant who has been a vociferous critic of the T.S.A., which he has called a bloated bureaucracy that threatens to make domestic airports resemble "the fall of Saigon" after Dec. 31.
Most airline Web sites also have useful holiday tips, especially for leisure travelers who haven't flown much under the new security regime and who don't want to hold up more experienced fellow travelers. 
The best, from my perspective, is by Southwest Airlines. Its "Travel Tips From the Experts" advises passengers to "screen themselves" before going to the airport. Among the tips: "Frequent travelers know that wearing metal jewelry and big diver-type watches will set off the alarm at security. But now that the security-screen devices have been set to their ultrasensitive settings, even watches with minimal bits of metal are ringing the bells."
Another good suggestion: Inspect baggage before packing because "luggage you haven't used for a while may be inadvertently hiding some things" like pocket knives that are prohibited in carry-ons and can cause alarms to go off loudly at checkpoints.
Incidentally, passengers who like to have reliable information to plan travel in advance will be saddened to know that Consumer Reports Travel Letter is ceasing publication with its January issue, after 17 years. The proliferation of free, up-to-the-minute travel information on the Internet is a major reason the magazine is closing. 
"There were a lot of difficulties bringing in subscriptions," said Gene Lomoriello, a spokesman for Consumers Union, which publishes the monthly advertising-free newsletter.
The sort of detailed holiday-travel advice that is now copiously available online was what many subscribers bought the magazine for, he said, adding, "The highest readership topics in that publication since 1999 were: worst economy seats, leisure air-fare bargains, how to get on-time flights and surviving holiday baggage wars at the airport."

HEADLINE: Sales of Existing Homes Up 6%; A Record-Level Year Is Expected 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
Sales of previously owned homes registered their third-best month on record in October and are on track to reach an all-time high this year, as low mortgage rates turned house hunters into buyers. 
 The National Association of Realtors reported today that existing-home sales climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.77 million in October, a 6.1 percent jump from the month before. 
 October's performance, which followed a 2.6 percent advance in sales in September, exceeded expectations. Analysts were forecasting a small dip in last month's sales. 
Housing has been a pillar supporting the economy as it struggles to return to full health. "With mortgage rates dropping to more than 30-year lows, people are viewing this as a home-buying bonanza," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group. 
Although many analysts think the economy has lost momentum this quarter, they said that yesterday's report reinforced their view that the country would avoid a return to recession. 
The 5.77 million sales pace in October tied with April's as the third-highest monthly level on record. Existing-home sales for all 2002 are expected to break the record set last year, the Realtors' group said. 
The national median price of an existing home rose to $159,600 in October, a 9.8 percent increase from the level of October 2001. It was the largest increase since July 1987. 
Maury Harris, chief economist at UBS Warburg, said, "The rise in housing wealth implied by these higher home prices will continue to help offset earlier losses of stock market wealth and enhance household spending power in a period of limited hiring." 
By region, home sales rose in the Northeast to an annual pace of 680,000, a 7.9 percent increase in October from September. In the West, sales were up 7.1 percent, to a pace of 1.50 million. In the South, sales rose 5.5 percent, to a 2.31 million pace. For the Midwest, sales increased 4.1 percent, to a pace of 1.27 million homes.

PERSON: John Rawls 

HEADLINE: John Rawls, Theorist on Justice, Is Dead at 82 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
John Rawls, the American political theorist whose work gave new meaning and resonance to the concepts of justice and liberalism, died on Sunday at his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 82.
 The cause was heart failure, his wife, Margaret, said. She said he had been incapacitated in varying degrees since suffering a stroke in 1995. 
 The publication of his book "A Theory of Justice" in 1971 was perceived as a watershed moment in modern philosophy and came at a time of furious national debate over the Vietnam War and the fight for racial equality. Not only did it veer from the main current of philosophical thought, which was then logic and linguistic analysis, it also stimulated a revival of attention to moral philosophy. Dr. Rawls made a sophisticated argument for a new concept of justice, based on simple fairness.
Before Dr. Rawls, the concept of utilitarianism, meaning that a society ought to work for the greatest good of the greatest number of people, held sway as the standard for social justice. He wrote that this approach could ride roughshod over the rights of minorities. Moreover, the liberty of an individual is of only secondary importance compared with the majority's interests.
His new theory began with two principles. The first was that each individual has a right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with the same liberty for others. The second was that social and economic inequalities are just only to the extent that they serve to promote the well-being of the least advantaged.
But how could people agree to structure a society in accordance with these two principles? Dr. Rawls's response was to revive the concept of the social contract developed earlier by thinkers like Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean Jacques Rousseau.
For people to make the necessary decisions to arrive at the social contract, Dr. Rawls introduced the concept of a "veil of ignorance." This meant that each person must select rules to live by without knowing whether he will be prosperous or destitute in the society governed by the rules he chooses. He called this the "original position."
An individual in the "original position" will choose the society in which the worst possible position -- which, for all he knows, will be his -- is better than the worst possible position in any other system.
The result, Dr. Rawls argued, was that the least fortunate would be best protected. The lowest rung of society would be higher. Though inequalities would not be abolished by favoring the neediest, they would be minimized, he argued.
In later works, Dr. Rawls expanded his arguments to suggest how a pluralistic society can be just to all its members. His idea was that the public could reason things out, provided comprehensive religious or philosophical doctrines are avoided. Dr. Rawls, like Kant, whom he revered, believed that as liberal democracies capable of such reasonableness spread, wars would be avoided.
Damon Linker in National Review in 2000 spoke for many conservative critics when he called Mr. Rawls's formulation hopelessly utopian. Mr. Rawls, he said, had "a childlike innocence about the ways of the world."
The conservative philosopher Robert Nozick likewise considered Dr. Rawls's argument egalitarian nonsense, but its impact is suggested by the 5,000 books or articles that took up the discussion. Many who bought Dr. Rawls's book -- which sold 200,000 copies, a huge number for an academic work -- were dazzled by his intellectual dexterity and moral clarity. Ben Rogers wrote in 1999 in The New Statesman that "Rawls has been recognized as the most important English-speaking philosopher of his generation." Mr. Rogers went on to say that Dr. Rawls "through a mixture of bold thought experiment, conceptual rigor and historical imagination, more or less invented analytic political thought."
John Bordley Rawls was born the second of five sons in Baltimore on Feb. 21, 1921. His father, William Lee Rawls, did not attend law school but through a clerkship at a law firm learned enough to become a lawyer and argue cases before the Supreme Court. His mother's advocacy of voting rights for women, among other issues, greatly influenced his own political and moral development.
He loved family vacations to Maine and would go on long sailing trips in a leaky boat. His love of the outdoors was later expressed in mountain climbing.
He graduated from the Kent School in Connecticut and from Princeton University, and planned to become a minister. But after serving as a combat infantryman in the South Pacific in World War II, he gave up his aspiration without explaining why, his wife said.
He returned to Princeton and earned a doctorate in philosophy, a decision he always explained by joking that he was not good enough in music or math. His interest in developing a theory of justice began in graduate school.
He taught at Oxford, Cornell and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before settling at Harvard, where his final position was James Bryant Conant university professor emeritus. His books included "Political Liberalism" (Columbia, 1993); Collected Papers (Harvard, 1999); "The Law of Peoples; with, The Idea of Public Reason Revisited" (Harvard, 1999) and "Justice as Fairness, a Restatement" (Harvard, 2001).
A modest, tweedy man, he turned down hundreds of honorary degrees, and accepted them only from universities with which he was associated (Oxford, Princeton, Harvard). In 1999, he won a National Humanities Medal, with the citation noting his success in helping women enter the ranks of a male-dominated field.
In addition to his wife, Dr. Rawls is survived by his brother William Stow Rawls of Philadelphia; his daughters, Ann Warfield Rawls of Beverly Hills, Mich., and Elizabeth Fox Rawls of Cambridge, Mass.; his sons, Robert Lee, of Woodinville, Wash., and Alexander Emory, of Palo Alto, Calif.; and four grandchildren.
Dr. Rawls's concern for justice and individual happiness is seen in a story from Harvard. When a candidate was defending his dissertation, Dr. Rawls noticed the sun shining in his eyes. He positioned himself between the candidate and the sunlight for the rest of the session.

HEADLINE: U.S. Tells Sri Lanka Rebels To Renounce Terror Tactics 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
A senior American official issued an unusual direct appeal today to Sri Lanka's rebels, one of the world's most ruthless guerrilla groups, to renounce violence permanently. 
 The appeal came at a donor conference in Oslo, attended by Sri Lanka's prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and by Anton Balasingham, the lead negotiator for the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, and representatives of more than three dozen countries. The Tigers have waged a 19-year struggle for an independent state for the minority Tamils in Sri Lanka. 
 Mr. Wickremesinghe and Mr. Balasingham met yesterday for the first time, the highest-level contact so far in a peace effort that began with a cease-fire last February. 
With both men in the audience today, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage urged the Tigers, who are on America's list of foreign terrorist organizations, to make, publicly, "a thorough renunciation of terrorism and violence," and to recognize the government's sovereignty over the whole country. 
"Tactics of terror can never achieve legitimate aspirations," Mr. Armitage said. 
With Mr. Armitage sitting in the front row today, Mr. Balasingham made clear the Tigers' position. He said that the rebels had pledged as part of the cease-fire "not to resort to war or violence." But he did not permanently renounce violence. 
Mr. Armitage's words reflected a factor that has brought the Tigers, who were known for their use of suicide bombers and child soldiers, to the negotiating table: the world's increased inhospitability to such tactics since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States. 
The Tigers are banned in the United States, Canada, Britain, India and Australia. Much of their overseas financing has dried up in the past year. 
The rebels, who have de facto control of much of the country's north and east, now seem determined to transform themselves into a mainstream political organization. 
The fact that officials from America and other countries that have banned the Tigers were sharing a room with them, though, illustrated an uncomfortable trade-off. Moving the peace efforts along also means increasing the Tigers' legitimacy. 
The conference came after the first two rounds of Norwegian-brokered peace talks between the government and the rebels produced surprisingly swift progress. The Tigers announced in the first round that they had abandoned their quest for a separate state, and instead would pursue regional autonomy. 
In the second round, the Tigers said that they would stop recruiting children as guerrillas, that they were seeking to take part in democracy and that they would allow other political parties into areas of Sri Lanka they control. The next round of talks is scheduled for Dec. 2 in Norway. 
Today's donor conference was a prelude to a bigger one planned for next year. In the short term, Britain pledged to donate an extra $12.6 million to Sri Lanka, according to Reuters, while the European Union said it would give $17.5 million in 2003 as well as $20 million to resettle the displaced. 
Mr. Armitage said the United States was willing to increase aid, but did not name a specific figure. 
The aid, which will be administered by a committee including representatives of the government and the Tigers, will go toward rebuilding the country's northeast, which has been devastated by the war.

HEADLINE: Bush Plan Ties Foreign Aid to Free Market and Civic Rule 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
The White House outlined a detailed proposal today to set up a competition among the world's poorest nations for portions of a new $5 billion foreign aid fund. To win, countries must demonstrate that they are curbing corruption, spending more on education and following free market economic principles.
 Under the plan, a new federal corporation will be set up to administer the aid, and decisions will be made by a Cabinet-level panel that will dole out the money much the way colleges assign scholarships. 
 The proposal has yet to be submitted to Congress, but it has a good chance of passing. 
"Think of it as a bonus pool," one of Mr. Bush's senior advisers said today, briefing reporters. The administration's judgments about which nations will get the money and which will not, he said, would depend on scores on a range of performance tests. The countries would be rated on everything from their encouragement of civil liberties and their spending on education and health, to their control of inflation and their use of budget targets and tax policy.
Mr. Bush first announced the plan, called the Millennium Challenge Account, in March, and said that over the next three years it would amount to $5 billion, a 50 percent increase in the amount of nonmilitary foreign aid the United States hands out each year. The fund, the administration says, would be in addition to money the Agency for International Development gives to poor nations, and in addition to other forms of aid.
Throughout Africa and Latin America, and in some poorer corners of Asia, nations have been waiting to hear what kind of conditions will be attached to the money. From today's description, the standards will be relatively tough. The unspoken message of the fund is that countries seeking the cash must show that they are reorganizing their societies according to Washington's standards.
Mr. Bush's senior aides have said in recent months that the new aid program is part of his effort to show another side of his foreign policy. "If you are talking all the time about hunting down terrorists one by one, you also need a positive message," one of his top advisers said last month. "And that means you have to be the first to put up new money, to show you are serious about it."
Organizations aiding developing countries largely praised the effort today, saying that if executed well, it could begin to solve the problem of billions of dollars of wasted or misallocated foreign aid. 
"It's a very big change, and it makes sense," said Steven C. Radelet, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, who served in the Treasury Department under President Bill Clinton and stayed through the first year of the Bush administration.
Experts said that they thought countries like Senegal, Ghana, Bolivia and Honduras might qualify early on, and that a second round might include India and Jordan.
Mr. Bush described his goals for the plan in March, when he said, "I'm not interested in funding corruption, period." He made it clear that he viewed his new fund as offering a chance to change the way foreign aid has been handed out for several decades.
At first, the only countries allowed to compete for the new foreign aid fund will be those with per capita incomes below $1,445, the threshold the World Bank uses to define the world's poorest nations.
That restriction will limit the first grants to nations primarily in Africa and Latin America, along with India. If Congress grants the full $5 billion Mr. Bush has sought, by the third year the program will be open to nations with per capita incomes of up to $2,975. That category includes the Philippines and some fast-growing Asian countries, among them Thailand, that are able to attract significant sums of private investment.
The administration's concept is simple: Countries with a demonstrated commitment to the rule of law and predictable and sound fiscal policy have the best chance of attracting private investors. The foreign aid grants would essentially amount to seed money, and Mr. Bush's aides said today that it might be given to nongovernmental organizations in some countries, rather than just to the central government.
"This would be an important tool in making aid more effective," said Mary E. McClymont, president of InterAction, an alliance of international relief and development organizations. "It's a big change, and it can work -- as long as we keep an eye on making sure there is sufficient funding for the nations that don't qualify, and for AIDS and famines and the needs of countries like Afghanistan."
Mr. Bush has described the new fund as additional foreign aid money; he says his administration plans to hold essentially level the amount it budgets for other forms of foreign aid, including humanitarian assistance. But in private, administration officials concede that there may be some movement in Congress to cut other forms of foreign assistance.
During the Clinton administration many conservative Republicans tried to cut foreign aid, saying much was wasted, and curtail American contributions to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Mr. Bush, though, has gone in the other direction and his administration's National Security Strategy published in September described the Millennium Challenge Account as a key element in maintaining American influence in the world. That strategy calls for, among other things, countries to cut taxes -- part of an administration effort to get the rest of the world to follow Mr. Bush's own philosophy.
The criteria announced today made no mention of cutting marginal tax rates, but they clearly call for American-style governance of markets, free trade and deregulation. In that regard, how open a country's market is to imports -- including American goods and services -- will be an important factor.
The new fund will be part of the administration's budget request for fiscal year 2004, and the announcement of the standards today was clearly part of a lobbying effort -- much of it aimed at Mr. Bush's own party -- to make clear that the president is pursuing a new approach. 
Administration officials said they did not intend merely to give countries a score. To qualify for a piece of the $5 billion pie, applicant nations have to do well in each of three different categories, and to demonstrate that they have cracked down on corruption.
Asked today if the new fund could deepen resentment that the United States sets the rules for world markets, one of Mr. Bush's senior advisers said: "No one is requiring countries to apply for this money. It's voluntary." But, he added, "if they want it, they have to show they play by the rules of the game."

HEADLINE: Well-Heeled Suburbs at Last Start Dressing the Part 

BYLINE:  By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
Every other Friday evening at the Round Hill Community House in Greenwich, Conn., about 100 children, most a good 12 years away from possessing the skill to make a decent stock pick, arrive to learn about what adulthood will require. Boys and girls are paired off and taught the fox trot, the waltz, the cha-cha and the ways of polite conversation. The class, called Barclay's Etiquette, asks that children dress formally, which has led many of the girls to show up looking like exceedingly stylish women in miniature.
 "A lot of the girls wear cocktail dresses and we're always saying to ourselves, 'They look like us," one young mother said. "Of course, fashion for children doesn't exactly cover the ground of 'what I need to wear to my ballroom dancing class when I'm 10,' " she added. 
 In the whole subgenre of 20th-century literature devoted to the habits and afflictions of the well-to-do in lower Fairfield County, Conn., one does not come across images of girls marching off to cotillions looking like Vogue editors, but then one doesn't come across images of their mothers looking that way either. 
But slowly, the world has become a different place. In a survey published by Women's Wear Daily this month, lower Fairfield County, which includes Greenwich, Westport, New Canaan and Stamford, ranked as the metropolitan region with the highest average annual spending on women's clothes per household in the United States. At $1,663, the figure is nearly double the number spent per household in Dallas. (San Jose ranked No. 2; New York City, with its masses of lower-income households, did not make the list.)
"It's just not as conservative as it used to be," said Debbie Needle, a Greenwich mother who has noticed a shift in fashion sensibility during the three and a half years she has lived there. "A lot of the younger people wear a lot of Dolce, which you wouldn't expect. No one is running around in Alexander McQueen, but people look hipper, and if they have the money but their taste isn't necessarily there yet, they get personal shoppers."
That there are certain corners of the world impervious to current economic realities is a lesson easily absorbed during a day spent on the elegant strip mall that is Greenwich Avenue, or along Main Street in Westport. 
Last Saturday, not long after Gary Shandling had walked through the doors at Mitchells, a 44-year-old clothing store in Westport, Bobbie Friedman, a tall painter in newsboy cap and a fur-collared Dolce & Gabbana coat, dropped off some medication she'd picked up for her favorite saleswoman, Phyllis Bershaw. Ms. Friedman said she visits Mitchells every day; she makes at least one purchase a week. Like many women in the area, her tastes have evolved over the years, past Ralph Lauren to European labels like Celine.
"Phyllis remembers what I have -- I don't and she'll tell me, 'You don't need this; you've already got it,' " Ms. Friedman said. Her dealings with Ms. Bershaw are so frequent that a few years ago, Ms. Friedman's husband, a restaurant owner, put a salad on his menu called the Phyllis.
Mitchells, like so many of the upper-end retail businesses in the area, is family-run. "The women's business has been growing at a rate faster than the men's business," Jack Mitchell, chairman of the company, said. Mr. Mitchell, who joined his family's company in 1969 after pursuing doctoral work in Chinese history at Berkeley, said his clients have become younger over the years. 
What one finds at Mitchells, and the Mitchell family's second store, Richards in Greenwich, is an inventory that tries to meet the demands not only of a younger community but also of an increasingly international one. The stores collectively carry Pucci, Missoni, Jean Paul Gaultier and Marc Jacobs. A YSL boutique opened at Richards earlier this season and has done well, Mr. Mitchell's son Andrew said. "The cruise collection is blowing out."
Along the retail corridor of Greenwich Avenue in Greenwich on a Saturday afternoon, well-dressed women were speaking Italian and Japanese as well as Spanish and Portuguese. The newsstand on the avenue carries a selection of publications that rivals that at a Paris kiosk: German, Japanese and Spanish editions of Vogue as well as Bunte, Corriere della Sera and nearly a half-dozen Arab newspapers.
A few doors down from Richards on Greenwich Avenue is Grossman's, a shoe shop that defies all laws of luxury merchandising in that it is poorly lighted, generally resembles a Stride Rite outlet circa 1978 and carries Jimmy Choo shoes. Lee Grossman, whose father founded the business in 1940, inherited it in the 1970's. 
"The maids were the customers until then," Mr. Grossman said. "I couldn't sell a $50 pair of shoes back then. If I'd gone high end, I would have gone out of business. People were snooty. If you bought something good it had to come from New York."
At Grossman's over the weekend, three young women who asked not to be named tried on boots and pointed out that layoffs have translated to increased opportunities for group shopping. Two of the women had retired from prominent banking positions in New York, and as one put it, "I shop and I work out."
A few hours earlier a saleswoman at Richards was whisking off to drive a sable coat to a client of hers who could not make it to a trunk show the store was holding for a furrier, Ben Kahn. The client had purchased 10 fur coats in 11 years, the saleswoman said. Over the course of two weekends, more than two dozen furs were sold.
At Betteridge's, a 105-year-old jeweler a few doors down from Richard's, a middle-aged man in a polar-fleece vest was looking for a yellow diamond to inset on a bracelet he had bought for his wife. He wanted the diamond to match a rare cut he had already purchased for a ring.
"You don't know what a joy it is for us to see something like this; it's so rare," the salesman said to his client of the ring stone.
"The talk around here about canary diamonds and pink diamonds among housewives is diabolical," said one Greenwich mother who did not wish to be named.
"When I was a kid in Greenwich there were a lot of wealthy families but their jewelry was inherited," explained Terry Betteridge, the third-generation proprietor of the shop. "Your typical customer then was someone whose sole motivation was capital preservation.
"I hear a lot of complaints about McMansions, but excuse me, these people have made their money. It's not awful. These people are fun and dynamic and they're confidant that if they spend all their money, they'll just go out and make more."

HEADLINE: New Assessment Inequities Cited As Nassau Races to Fix Old Ones 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Nov. 25 

 BODY:
Nassau County is rushing to meet a court deadline to fix its antiquated property assessments, but now several officials fear that new flaws in the revised tax rolls could perpetuate inequities for years.
 Critics say the discrepancies include the overpricing of vacant lots, whose assessments nearly tripled, and the underpricing of some prime waterfront properties by $100,000 or more -- at values even lower than what they actually sold for. 
 Those disputed assessments, if locked in, could affect not only the owners of those properties but all other taxpayers as well. And they could subvert one of the main goals of the revaluation: by making assessments accurate, officials hope to stem an onslaught of tax grievances that have saddled the county with $1 billion in debt for tax refunds and helped push Nassau to near-bankruptcy. 
Now several officials here are investigating the assessments, conducting audits and holding public hearings. They say they are especially concerned to get the new numbers right, because an obscure state law makes it hard to raise the assessments later. It limits increases to 6 percent a year and 20 percent in five years. Inflation and rising market prices can easily outpace the allowed assessment increases, preserving the disparities.
"If we don't get it right now, we never will," said Jeffrey B. Gold, who sits on Nassau's Board of Assessors.
The debate arises because Nassau is revaluing all 416,000 properties for the first time in 64 years. It was forced to do so by a court-imposed settlement of a suit charging racial disparities in the old system. The reassessment is supposed to be finished by year's end.
Reassessment is dear to the pocketbooks of property owners. The valuations are used to calculate the tax bill on every home and business in Nassau, which has one of the nation's highest tax burdens.
Defenders of the reassessment contend that it has gone well, leading to fewer protests than is typical elsewhere. They concede there are some glitches that need correction, and indeed the numbers are still being tweaked. But the atmosphere is testy at the assessment board, which is overseeing the 30-month project done by a consultant, the Cole Layer Trumble Company of Dayton, Ohio, for $34 million.
"Let's lower the temperature in here," the board's vice chairman, Dennis B. Brown, said after an angry exchange on Friday.
Although the assessors and the courts have the final say, other officials are getting in on the act. County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi, who took office Jan. 1, appointed Harvey B. Levinson, the former chief assistant district attorney, as his special assistant for reassessment. Mr. Levinson said that in his watchdog role, he was reviewing hundreds of complaints and would hold a public hearing on Sunday.
"I don't think any issue has generated more emotion and more confusion among residents," Mr. Levinson said. He said he was aiming for accuracy because "if people are assessed too low, that means the tax rate is higher to make up for it, and everybody else has to pick up the bill."
Nassau's new comptroller, Howard S. Weitzman, has his staff auditing the reassessment. He said he wanted to guard against flaws that would spur further appeals, especially from owners of commercial property, who have collected most of the tax refunds.
The County Legislature will hold its own hearing Tuesday night, at the urging of Legislator David Denenberg, who held community meetings that highlighted the waterfront issue.
Politics is a strong undercurrent. The assessment board chairman, Charles O'Shea, is a Republican whose re-election next year hinges on voter reaction to the revaluation. Mr. Suozzi, Mr. Weitzman and the Legislature's majority are all Democrats. So is Mr. Levinson, who is mentioned as a possible challenger to Mr. O'Shea. Mr. Suozzi also appointed three Democrats and an independent to control the assessment board. 
"All these forces seem to be marshaling against the process with just five weeks left to go and with the finish line in sight," Mr. O'Shea said. "I'm not going to let this process get hijacked by petty partisan politics." 
He said "this mammoth job was done as accurately as it could" with the time allowed and method used. The values were set by mass appraisal, applying formulas to sale prices on similar properties.
Only 8 percent of owners protested their assessments, about half the 15 percent norm in other reassessments, Mr. O'Shea said. The final adjustments will be mailed in two weeks. Owners who are still dissatisfied can complain to a county panel and to the courts.
But underassessment -- which owners never protest -- is the focus of Mr. Suozzi's board appointees. They say they found some properties underassessed by $75,000 to $1 million on the waterfront, which includes nearly 10,000 lots on the Atlantic Ocean and Long Island Sound, as well as bays, canals and creeks.
"The system didn't work," said Mr. Gold, who called the waterfront a gilded ghetto. "This is not about politics; this is about fairness. How can you tell the owner of a $250,000 house they have to subsidize a $1.5 million house?"
The critics also said their complaints got slow reaction. Reassessment consultants said that they recently reviewed about 6,000 waterfront properties and raised the values of 350 by about a fourth. That did not go far enough, Mr. Gold said.
An independent monitor for the assessment board, James Culver, defended the figures and said he was "dumbfounded" by the criticism. "One sale does not make the market," he said. "People overpay, people underpay. The statistics on this reassessment are as good as any I've seen. This is as good as it gets."

HEADLINE: BP Pulls Out Of Campaign To Open Up Alaskan Area 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
BP, the world's third-largest oil company, has pulled out of a major lobbying group that is spearheading the campaign to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil drilling, a company spokesman said yesterday.
 Oil development in the refuge is a touchstone of the Bush administration's energy policy. BP's decision to drop out of the drilling debate underscores the growing concern among many oil companies that the matter has become a public relations liability, both critics and supporters of oil production in the refuge said. 
 BP's move comes just as the Republicans, who back drilling in the area, are about to regain control of the Senate, giving proponents their best chance in years to pass legislation opening the area along Alaska's Beaufort Sea coast to oil exploration. 
The company -- which has been in Alaska since oil was first produced there and is among the state's biggest oil operators -- insisted yesterday that the decision to leave Arctic Power, the lobbying group, was not meant as a broader statement on the economic viability or morality of drilling in the refuge. Opponents of drilling have said that developing oil in the narrow coastal plain of the refuge would destroy one of the world's last remaining bits of untouched wilderness. 
Lord Browne, BP's chief executive, said this year that BP was cutting costs in Alaska by ending expensive exploration efforts in new, or "frontier," areas and focusing instead on smaller finds near existing fields and facilities. Still, the company plans to continue investing $500 million a year in Alaska for the foreseeable future, according to Paul Laird, a spokesman for BP Alaska.
"A signal isn't being sent, but a signal is being received," Mr. Laird said in an interview from Anchorage. 
"The only message is that we are no longer going to be involved in ANWR debate," he said, referring to the refuge. "When and if the American people decide ANWR should be opened, we will consider it based on its commercial and competitive attributes."
Mr. Laird said that the company had been mulling the decision for the last few months and told Arctic Power of its intentions last week. The news of BP's departure was first published Friday in Petroleum News Alaska, an industry newsletter.
BP played down its involvement in Arctic Power, maintaining that its annual membership fee of $50,000 was small and its activity minimal. But BP had been the host for delegations of Washington politicians and journalists visiting Alaska to see the coastal plain. And Kim Duke, executive director of Arctic Power, said BP's fee was "at the top of the scale for us."
Over the last few years, oil executives have repeatedly said in private that drilling in the refuge is not a priority. Proponents of drilling have said that 16 billion barrels of oil, a huge amount in industry terms, lies below the tundra of the refuge's coastal plain. But a study by the United States Geological Survey estimated that there are 3.2 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil at $20 a barrel. 
BP is one of two oil companies to have drilled exploratory wells in the area about 20 years ago, but the results are proprietary. The company said that its decision to leave Arctic Power had nothing to do with those findings, but other parties in the debate said the refuge's economic prospects were likely to have figured in the decision.
"I think it was a confluence of things," said Athan Manuel, director of the Arctic wilderness campaign at the Public Interest Research Group in Washington, which has been pushing BP to take such a step. "They seem to have studied the geology and the economics of how much oil they can get out of there, and I think they decided they can't get the oil out economically. So it's financially risky. And politically, it's not a popular stance."
BP has fashioned an image over the last few years as a company concerned about the environment, and drilling in the refuge cuts against that view. Most oil companies are reluctant to face the popular protests at board meetings and service stations that could follow if they took a vocal role in campaigning for the opening of the refuge, and so have kept a low profile while politicians and environmentalists debated the issue, industry executives say.
Supporters of drilling said they did not think BP's departure from Arctic Power portended more defections. Nor did they think that the move would hurt the effort to open the refuge. 
"I fully expect when we have ANWR open, BP will look at the leases for sale," Ms. Duke said. "This is not a signal that they do not want to be a player here from now to the end of time. It's a business decision for them for now."

HEADLINE: STATES ARE FACING BIG FISCAL CRISES, GOVERNORS REPORT 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
Plunging tax collections and soaring medical costs have created the worst fiscal problems for states since World War II, the National Governors Association said today.
 "Nearly every state is in fiscal crisis," the governors said in a new report surveying the states. 
 The states' fiscal woes will force governors, many of them newly elected, to propose politically sensitive tax increases or drastic cuts in services. 
Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the governors association, said states were increasing tuition at public colleges and universities, cutting Medicaid eligibility and benefits, increasing taxes on individuals and corporations and laying off state employees. 
"You will see huge cuts in Medicaid" next year, beyond the cutbacks already enacted, Mr. Scheppach said.
Medicaid and other health costs like employee health benefits account for 30 percent of state spending and grew last year by 13 percent, the largest increase in a decade, the report said. At a time when revenues are declining, Mr. Scheppach said, such growth is unaffordable and unsustainable.
Governors and state budget officers said the fiscal condition of the states was more dire than the condition of the national economy. The recession has reduced state revenues, especially personal income and capital gains taxes, Mr. Scheppach said, but the states' fiscal problems are also linked to long-term trends, like the increase in health costs and the growing importance of services in the economy.
Relatively few of the newly elected governors have said precisely how they will deal with these fiscal problems. "Most of them don't understand how bad it is," Mr. Scheppach said.
In its "Fiscal Survey of States," the governors association found that the amount of money states had on hand at the end of the most recent fiscal year had fallen to $14.5 billion, from a peak of $48.8 billion in 2000. The current balance equaled 2.9 percent of state spending, the smallest cushion since 1992.
Total state tax collections fell by 6 percent last year and declined in every quarter, even as spending grew by 1.3 percent, Mr. Scheppach said.
These figures are consistent with data reported recently by the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York, which found tax revenues down 6.3 percent in the fiscal year that ended June 30. Among states reporting the largest reductions were Alaska, Oregon, California, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York.
In New York, the budget director for Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, told state agencies last week to cut spending by 5 percent in the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends on March 31. The budget director, Carole E. Stone, also said that cuts next year would be deeper than expected. The state is facing a deficit that legislators have estimated at $5 billion to $10 billion.
Oklahoma is experiencing the worst budget crisis in decades. Oklahoma State University, in Stillwater, was told to return money to the state, and its library has reduced its hours. The state finance director has instructed all state agencies to reduce spending by 6.5 percent.
Gov. Gray Davis of California, a Democrat, said last week that he would call a special session of the State Legislature to consider $5 billion of spending cuts and other emergency measures to "stanch the bleeding" in state finances. The governor told legislative leaders that the deficit in the coming year could exceed $21 billion. 
Herb J. Wesson Jr., the Democratic speaker of the California Assembly, said, "This is a terrible crisis, and every Californian will be affected."
In Illinois, a Democrat will become governor for the first time in 26 years, and he will inherit a huge problem: a deficit that could grow to $2.5 billion, in a budget totaling $50 billion.
In his campaign, the governor-elect, Rod R. Blagojevich, said that Illinois could resolve its budget problems without an increase in sales or income taxes. But aides to Gov. George Ryan, a Republican, said that spending cuts made last spring were overwhelmingly unpopular, and that further cuts would be extraordinarily difficult.
To deal with a fiscal crisis in Arizona, the governor-elect, Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, wants agencies to cut spending by 10 percent across the board, making exceptions only for education, corrections and some children's services.
The University of Iowa increased tuition and fees this year by 18.5 percent, the biggest increase in more than two decades, after an increase of 9.9 percent in the prior year. The state Board of Regents is considering further increases for the next academic year.
Most of the tax changes made by states in the last year affected tobacco levies. Nineteen states increased cigarette taxes, many by more than 50 cents a pack, the governors' survey said.
Services account for a growing share of state economic activity, but states have found it difficult, for political reasons, to increase taxes on services. Likewise, Mr. Scheppach said, "it's very hard to raise taxes on middle-income Americans, when they don't have secure health insurance, to pay for health care for low-income Americans."
State tax collections came in far below the states' original estimates in the most recent fiscal year, which ended on June 30 for most states. Sales tax revenues, $147.6 billion, were 3.2 percent lower than expected, while personal income tax revenues ($187.7 billion) were down 12.8 percent and corporate income tax receipts ($21.6 billion) were down 21.5 percent.
In July, the United States Senate overwhelmingly approved a proposal to provide fiscal relief to states through a temporary increase in federal grants for Medicaid and social services, but it never became law. The Bush administration and Senator Don Nickles, the Oklahoma Republican in line to become chairman of the Budget Committee in the new Congress, opposed the increase.
Federal officials say they have no money to spare at a time when the federal government faces growing deficits, after four years of surpluses.
Mr. Scheppach cataloged some of the states' needs. After the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush sought $3.5 billion to train and equip local police officers, firefighters and rescue workers, but Congress adjourned last week without providing the money.
Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston, president of the United States Conference of Mayors, said cities were spending $2.6 billion on new security measures without receiving any direct federal assistance.
With great fanfare, Congress passed legislation last month to clean up the nation's election procedures. But it provided none of the money promised to states to help them buy new election machinery and to train poll workers to comply with the law.
On Oct. 1, states lost $1.2 billion that had been appropriated by Congress to provide health coverage for low-income children. The money, unclaimed after four years, reverted to the Treasury, and Congress did nothing to restore it, despite pleas from states.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Seek To Abolish Many Tariffs 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, hoping to jump-start global trade negotiations, will propose a plan on Tuesday to eliminate all tariffs on industrial and consumer goods by 2015, officials said tonight.
 The plan, which will be submitted to the World Trade Organization in Geneva, would cover not only big industrial products like cars and machinery but also labor-intensive consumer goods like clothing, textiles and leather handbags that are still fairly heavily protected in the United States. 
 Administration officials said their plan would "turn every corner store into a duty-free shop" and would eliminate about $18 billion in tariffs that American consumers pay each year.
While the offer to open American markets is in many respects radical, it also plays to the United States' strengths and would require most other countries to cut their tariffs more drastically and more rapidly than the United States. 
Trade experts say the Bush administration may also be trying to regain credibility on free-trade issues, after giving into demands for protectionist measures from the steel industry and from American farmers earlier this year.
The proposal is almost certain to run into objections from many countries in Latin America and Asia, which are likely to argue that their domestic industries would have to endure severe competitive jolts on the industrial side while still facing steep barriers to the American markets for agriculture. 
American tariffs on manufactured products average about 5 percent, lower than those in many developing countries, but they run as high as 20 percent for certain kinds of clothing, 16 percent for many kinds of luggage and 13 percent for some leather goods.
The United States also imposes a wide variety of "anti-dumping" and "safeguard" tariffs on imported steel, which run well above 30 percent in some cases and are not expected to be affected by the new plan.
"The strategy could be to get on the good side of the rhetorical fight," said Gary Hufbauer, a trade analyst at the Institute for International Economics, a research group in Washington. 
Scott Otteman, director of trade policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, expressed cautious support for the idea. Many manufacturing groups have lobbied in favor of negotiating for deep reciprocal tariff cuts in particular industrial sectors, but Mr. Otteman said the group is leery of relying only on across-the-board tariff reductions.
The new proposals will be announced on Tuesday by the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, and the secretary of commerce, Donald Evans.
They are being submitted as part of the global trade talks that were started last year in Doha, Qatar. American officials hope to inject some electricity into the talks, which have lost considerable momentum over the last year in large part because both the United States and the European Union have been backsliding toward greater protectionism.
The Bush administration infuriated governments around the world by imposing new "safeguard" tariffs on imported steel last March. Attitudes toward free trade soured even more after Congress passed and President Bush signed a sweeping farm bill that could provide up to $180 billion in farm subsidies over the next six or eight years.
Under the plan, any tariff that is 5 percent or lower would be eliminated in 2005, the year that countries hope to adopt a new global trade agreement. Other, higher tariffs would then be "harmonized" and reduced to no more than 8 percent by 2010. The most difficult tariff issues would be dealt with by 2015.
The European Union has submitted a somewhat more modest proposal, which calls for cutting the highest tariffs on manufactured goods rather than eliminating all tariffs.
The biggest objections are likely to be about the "harmonization" period, because countries with high tariffs would be required to push through the biggest reductions and suffer far more disruption than those with lower tariffs.
The White House came up with a similar plan last summer to reduce agricultural tariffs and subsidies. That plan called for reducing tariffs from an average of 62 percent to 15 percent over five years. But the plan calls for the deepest tariff cuts by countries with the highest duties, and it has been greeted coldly by the European Union.

HEADLINE: Accessories Are Taking Center Shelf 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
Looking for the perfect little black dress may be harder this season. But the search for the perfect little Isabella Fiore purse, encrusted with vintage-looking sequined cartoons, just became a lot easier.
 With apparel sales sinking, retailers across the country are shifting some of their focus to accessories. They are restructuring their stores to show off more items like handbags, scarves, gloves, jewelry and sunglasses to keep the cash registers ringing up sales in what analysts are predicting will be a lackluster holiday shopping season. 
 Department stores and manufacturers are notoriously reluctant to part with sales figures. Apparel sales, however, were off more than 8 percent last year -- down to $165 billion from $180 billion in 2000 -- according to NPD Fashionworld, a market research company. Marshal Cohen, co-president of NPD, estimated that sales this year, computed through September, are running 2 percent below last year. 
The one bright spot, retail executives and analysts agree, is the growth of the clothing accessory business. Tina Johnson, the chief executive at Saks Fifth Avenue, called it the fastest-growing segment of the store's business. 
"Accessories are driving the retail business," said Laura Pomerantz, a partner in a New York-based national real estate brokerage firm that specializes in retail leases. "Most of the clients looking for shop space these days seem to be accessory shops."
At Bloomingdale's, a unit of Federated Department Stores, costume jewelry is going into glass cases and has just been installed in carpeted dressing rooms. At Henri Bendel, barrettes just moved down to the main floor, displacing sweaters. Saks is spending $33 million to reconfigure its accessory boutiques at its Fifth Avenue flagship store, lopping off the old-fashioned mahogany center poles to better show off the handbags along the walls. Shawls are being featured at Lord & Taylor, a unit of May Department Stores, and fringed belts are big at Nordstrom. Lands' End, a unit of Sears, Roebuck, is bolstering its line of tote bags. At Wal-Mart, a spokeswoman said that accessories "are more important than ever, and no longer driven by just the junior market; they now span all ages."
In uncertain economic times, men and women buy more accessories, said Jill Brooke, the editor of Avenue magazine, which features high-end retail and real estate ads. "If they can't buy a $5,000 Prada outfit, they'll buy a $200 Prada scarf and still be part of the dream," she said. "Even in the Depression, women still bought lipstick." 
In a recent survey, John Theiss, vice president for retail at American Express, said that American shoppers planned to increase significantly their purchases of accessories as holiday gifts. He compared this year's choices with those in the last two years: in 2000, 24 percent of those surveyed said they would buy women's accessories, including scarves and handbags. This year, that number almost doubled -- to 40 percent. For men's accessories, the level rose from 21 percent of shoppers to 36 percent this year. Planned jewelry purchases rose from 22 percent, to 40 percent; perfume went from 31 percent, to 53 percent.
What is unusual about this year's shift is that it seems to have as much to do with customers' self-expression as with their pocketbooks. Shoppers whose closets are already full of black suits and white dress shirts are looking for signature items to distinguish themselves as individuals, not as people who follow the pack, said Russ Jones, vice president for retail consulting at Cap Gemini Ernst & Young.
"Apparel sales are weak, given the economy, but even more important, given the lack of newness in the fashion," said Bob Buchanan, a retail analyst at A. G. Edwards. Women, particularly, still want to spend, he said, "but they're spending on jazzing up their look."
Old-fashioned mainstays like khaki pants and cable-knit sweaters, along with lower-priced items like hosiery, are being banished to the upper floors -- or to the sale rack -- as one-of-a-kind items (or items that look one of a kind) take center stage: orange leather gloves (orange is big this season); a Hermes scarf; a Kate Spade date book; a $1,200 vintage rhinestone bow pin, sold from a department store's glass case.
Today, accessories are "the image makers," said Mr. Cohen of NPD. "A lot of retailers used to put accessories at the back of the store or on second. No more."
By contrast, designer sportswear is no longer the powerhouse it once was, analysts say, despite critical applause for the current fashions.
"It's no secret that the designer collections are flat in a lot of the retail market," said Ed Burstell, general manager of Henri Bendel, part of Limited Brands and one of New York City's highest-end department stores. "If we're looking for an increase we're looking for it in cosmetics and accessories. It'll be what's happening between now and Christmas."
At Target, Douglas Kline, a spokesman, said that the company was focusing more on accessories than in years past. "We're paying more attention to their design; there are more exclusive designs this year than last year." At the Gap, a spokeswoman said, long scarves were popular. At H & M, the Swedish-based youth-oriented bargain retailer, Karen Belva, a spokeswoman, said that sales of embroidered purses, wide belts and beaded jewelry were soaring. 
For the manufacturers, accessories offer the allure of higher profit margins -- 80 percent on accessories versus 50 to 60 percent on clothes, according to several analysts. For department stores starved for sales, today's accessories can be a lot more expensive than clothes: at $1,600, a zebra-patterned Fendi Ostrik handbag (made out of goat hair) sure beats the sale of $29.99 khakis or a $5 pair of tights. And the rhinestone costume jewelry sold at Bendel's runs into the hundreds of dollars.
Some merchandisers saw the trend coming -- and they, along with some retail pollsters, contend it has little or nothing to do with the ups and downs of the economy. At Bergdorf Goodman, part of the Neiman Marcus Group, and Saks, for instance, the planning for the accessories expansions began long before consumer confidence began to ebb.
At Yves St. Laurent, now owned by the Gucci Group, sales of accessories -- including the popular Mombasa bag -- have grown 207 percent the last year, and now make up 20 percent of Yves St. Laurent's business in its 45 shops around the world. That contrasts with growth of 35 percent in men's clothing sales and 50 percent in women's clothing.
At Coach, where overall sales were up 28 percent in the quarter ended in late September, sales of accessories other than handbags have doubled the last three years. Charm bracelets and dog-bone key fobs were introduced this season. At Perry Ellis, sales of belts are up 20 percent; leather goods, 14 percent; neckwear, 10 percent; and fragrances, 11 percent. Bendel has doubled the size of its jewelry display, tripled the size of its hair accessories (and moved it down to the first floor) and banished sweaters from the prime spot opposite the second-floor elevator. Hats, too, have moved to the high-rent district of the main floor. As a consequence, Mr. Burstell said, sales in those categories have increased significantly since Labor Day.
People want to love what they buy; in this tough retail environment, he added, "you have to have an emotional, sentimental attachment to an item to separate you from your money."
Ron Frasch, chief executive of Bergdorf Goodman, said that he was revamping parts of the first floor of the New York store to show more handbags and jewelry and was reconstructing the designer alley on the second floor, which now features only apparel. Construction will start in January to incorporate accessories in the boutiques, he said.
In the last six months, Saks Fifth Avenue has created large first-floor boutiques for nine luxury accessory makers, including Bottega Veneta, Gucci, Burberry and Prada. Yves St. Laurent's nook is opening in two weeks, and Louis Vuitton is opening in the spring. The store has also broadened its selections, by adding Lulu Guinness and Isabella Fiore's one-of-a-kind-looking bags, which sell for $250 to $400 to a mostly younger clientele.
Much of the $30-billion-a-year accessory business is driven by the youthful shopper.
"Everyone wants accessories. Our teen retailers want more accessories to sell," said Eric Beder, retail analyst with Laudenburg Thalmann. "In the teen market, they're adding more displays for impulse purchase: no more plain gold hoops, they want big, chunky signature stuff: turquoise or mother of pearl or Asian motifs, shawls, chopsticks for their hair." 
Mr. Beder paused. "Love those tchotchkes," he said.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Welfare Initiatives Do Not Address Needs of Immigrant Families 

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE CLEMETSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
Many programs intended to lift people out of poverty by promoting marriage and mandating work do not address the realities of poor immigrants, a study released today has found.
 The report, by the Urban Institute, a public policy research group in Washington, was based on a national survey of more than 42,000 households. The study showed that low-income immigrant families were more likely than their native counterparts to have two parents in the household and that poverty often persisted in these families despite the fact that both parents worked. 
 The study found, for example, that children of two-parent immigrant families were twice as likely to live in low-income households as children of two-parent native families. Low income is defined as less than twice the federal poverty line, which was $16,700 for a family of four in 1999. 
"It shows that policies that assume low incomes are a result of not engaging in the work force, or not having stable families, are wide of the mark," said Michael Fix, director of immigration studies at the Urban Institute and an author of the study. "Since it is wages, not lack of employment or work ethic, that is at issue, what these families seem to need are work supports to enable them to boost their wages."
Such supports, according to immigrant advocacy groups that have reviewed the study, include language and job skills training and improved access to health care, child care and low-cost housing programs.
In particular, immigrant advocates say programs focusing on marriage promotion and work requirements divert attention and money from efforts to restore access to services for newer immigrants.
The findings should be "a call to action for Congress and the administration," said Marcela Urrutia, a policy analyst for the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group. "Both parties have been doing a really good job in their rhetoric to immigrant and Latino families, but to this point they haven't put their money where their mouths are."
Dr. Wade Horn, assistant secretary for children and families for the Department of Health and Human Services, said the study focused on the wrong data.
"The comparison should not be between married immigrants and nonimmigrants, but between married immigrants and nonmarried immigrants," Dr. Horn, a strong supporter of marriage promotion as part of welfare programs, said.
"If the comparison were fair," he said, "I'm certain it would indicate that nonmarried immigrant households are, in fact, poorer than married immigrant families." 
Dr. Horn also called the study short-sighted. "The fact that the vast majority of these families work very hard is good news in the long term," he said. "The evidence shows that reliable workers get rewarded with additional opportunities."
The study does not cite individual cases, but the authors say challenges for immigrant families are especially persistent in states with recent booms in immigrant population. 
An immigrant woman from Guatemala who would not allow her last name to be used because of the legal status of some family members said that improving the livelihood of her family seemed out of reach.
The woman, a housekeeper for a major hotel chain, moved a year ago with her husband and their three children to Nebraska, a state with a fast-growing immgrant population. She makes $7.04 an hour, and her husband, a dishwasher at a restaurant, makes $7.25 an hour. Each earns more than the minimum wage, but a recent study of living costs in Nebraska found that in a two-parent family with two children, each parent would need to make at least $10 an hour for the family to be self-sufficient.
Because the couple's three children are American citizens, they receive Medicaid, but the parents are uninsured. They speak limited English, and, because of their residency status, they are barred from or have difficulty gaining access to language and job-training programs.
"We're working just to be able to survive," said the woman, who said she relied on help from the Salvation Army and local schools for clothing and other necessities for the children. "I would look for another job with better pay, but I would need to be better qualified."
The Urban Institute study looked at the challenges faced by immigrant households like the Guatemalan woman's. It found that the percentages of children of immigrants in poor to fair health -- as opposed to good health -- are more than twice those of children of natives. 
Stable family structure, though, appears to shield children in low-income immigrant families from other difficulties. Low-income working immigrant parents are less likely to read to their children or to be involved in community or school activities, the study found, but the children are no more likely than their counterparts in nonimmigrant families to exhibit behavioral problems or a lack of engagement in school.
"There are some inherent strengths in immigrant families that provide protective factors for children in some areas," said Randy Capps, an author of the study. "But the level of unmet need, in terms of health care, housing and food assistance, shows that there are areas in which there is a role for public policy to provide additional support."

PERSON: Timothy H. Bishop 

HEADLINE: Ready to Vote Denim Over White Collar 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN FINN 

DATELINE: WESTHAMPTON BEACH, N.Y. 

 BODY:
IT is no accident that the campaign headquarters of incoming Representative Timothy H. Bishop are in near anonymity in a strip mall just north of the railroad tracks here, snuggled next door to a NAPA Auto Parts store that, unlike this political whistle-stop, is doing a brisk business on a rainy postelection afternoon. Here at headquarters, even the newly minted politician himself is nowhere in evidence. 
 Mr. Bishop, 52, is an unassuming guy. It runs in his family, which came to Southampton village from Southampton, England, in 1643 and never left. His maternal grandparents were potato farmers, and he passed childhood summers picking peas and beans, and spent autumn weekends harvesting potatoes. 
 He still lives a block from the house he grew up in, still plays softball. When Mr. Bishop, wearing a sweat-stained tangerine baseball cap, chambray work shirt, black jeans and umpteen days' growth of gray beard, finally ambles in from the parking lot, it is tempting to mistake him for an auto parts customer.
But he knows who he is. "I'm Tim Bishop, and I guess you're here for me," he says, extending a hand and offering, along with a slight smile that has not been laser-lightened for spectacular sound bites, a souvenir stars-and-stripes pinwheel from a box of leftover election-night party favors. 
Mr. Bishop, just in from Washington, where he underwent orientation, bonded with new Democratic peers ("I met a lot of them, and so far I wouldn't describe them as slick at all"), and rented an apartment on Capitol Hill -- he's tickled to be able to walk to work. He does have a $150,000 Congressional salary, so it's not as if he can't afford wheels. He prefers to simplify, hence his vacation from the razor. He dressed down not only because all his suits are wrinkled from the Washington visit, but also because he votes denim over white collar. 
He is just back from a lunch with local buddies preceded by a stint on the local campus radio station, WLIU, which made him honorary D.J. on its "The Song Is You" segment. His picks included "Go to the Mirror" from the Who's rock opera "Tommy," the anthem of his undergraduate days at Holy Cross College, and Van Morrison's "Into the Mystic." That Long Island's favorite singing son, Billy Joel, didn't make the cut seems an indication Mr. Bishop isn't unduly obsessed with being geographically correct. 
He saves that for the issues. Conservation is a rallying point (and was an Achilles' heel for his opponent, Felix J. Grucci Jr.), as is health care for the elderly and tax cuts for the working class. He advocates the creation of a Peconic County to represent what is now the eastern end of Suffolk, though that, he notes, is a state issue. 
"I may be swimming against the tide," says Mr. Bishop, "but I plan to argue for a tax cut," meaning one that would benefit the working classes and not just the rich.
"I'm not an economist, but it looks to me that what they're doing now is the same thing they did in the 1980's, trickle-down economics. It was wrong then and it's wrong now. 
"I'm a hardworking guy from a hardworking family who worked for a college that serves middle-class families. I'm sort of a caregiver type. I'm only interested in political power to the extent that it can do good." 
SOON this headquarters, where the thermometer-shaped campaign fund "goal-o-meter" on the wall wears a smile face, will cease to be. Mr. Bishop, a triple-decade employee of Southampton College, where he became provost in 1986 after working his way up the job ladder rung-by-rung since 1973, will go to Capitol Hill to work on his name recognition after ousting Mr. Grucci, the Republican incumbent and fireworks scion. 
A genuine political neophyte -- unless one counts his chairmanship of the Southampton Town Board of Ethics or that his great-grandfather, Benjamin Bishop, was mayor of Southampton in the early 1900's -- he won office after a mean-spirited campaign. He produced a report that accused Mr. Grucci's company of contaminating water wells. Sure it was negative, says Mr. Bishop, but it was "impeccably sourced." 
Meantime, the Grucci camp attacked him. Based on a discredited article in a 1994 student newspaper, it accused him of taking part in a cover-up of campus rapes while provost, and it used his opposition to the death penalty to imply he opposed the execution of Osama bin Laden. 
The attacks backfired. The race received national attention. A framed Newsday cartoon in Mr. Bishop's office, a gift from his staff, features Mr. Grucci holding a match to a firecracker. The firecracker, which has Negative Ads written on it, takes a boomerang's trajectory and is aimed at Mr. Grucci's rear. 
"He had held all the cards, but those ads put the race in the spotlight and gave me the sympathy factor," Mr. Bishop says. "Six months ago people didn't know I existed, but all of a sudden they're coming up to me and telling me how bad they felt about it. Not that I needed my faith in human nature restored, but it did it. I'm not Don Quixote, but I never for a moment thought this was a fool's errand."

To the Editor:
 Health care is an economic commodity, just like food, clothing, housing and entertainment. But unlike other commodities where the cost is paid directly by the consumer, third-party health insurance creates a supply-driven system with little incentive for comparison shopping or common-sense consideration of access. 
 As for any commodity, priorities must be set and budgets established. In a Nov. 25 front-page article, you quote one woman as saying it was "humiliating, being in the doctor's office without insurance." But how many Americans are humiliated when they pass the packages of sirloin and opt for chuck? Or when they arrange monthly payments to make a capital purchase? Should the purchase of medical care be any different?

To the Editor:
Re "Problem of Lost Health Benefits Is Reaching Into the Middle Class" (front page, Nov. 25): I am disheartened that Congress's newfound interest in the health care problem is a result of the fact that being uninsured is no longer a "problem chiefly of the poor and the unemployed."
 I sympathize with one uninsured woman's "humiliating" experience when she took her daughter to the doctor. 
But I wonder if her humiliation was a result of not being able to pay the doctor or a result of feeling the social stigma that has been attached to being uninsured. 
 Most social problems (for example, teenage pregnancy, drug abuse and school violence) fail to gain interest from the public and the government until they begin to reach into the largely nonminority middle class. Now that the problem of being uninsured has been "validated" because of its effects on the middle class, it is possible that actions will be taken to remedy the situation.

Ad Spending Rose In First Three Quarters

BYLINE:  By Allison North Jones 

 BODY:
Rebounding from the depressed advertising market of 2001, ad spending in major media rose 3.8 percent for the first three quarters of 2002 compared with the period a year earlier, according to a report yesterday from Nielsen Monitor Plus in New York, part of the Nielsen Media Research unit of VNU.
 The increase, to $69.3 billion, from $66.7 billion, was driven by growth in ad spending in 8 of 11 media categories tracked by Nielsen Monitor Plus. 
The medium with the largest percentage increase from January through September was local newspapers, up 9.5 percent; followed by network television, up 7.9 percent; and network radio, up 7.3 percent. The medium with the largest percentage decrease in ad spending was national newspapers, down 9.3 percent; followed by nationally syndicated television programs, down 8.7 percent; and the Internet, down 1 percent. 
 The report came after another tracking service, CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres, released a report on ad spending in major media in the first three quarters, concluding that it rose 2.2 percent compared with the period a year earlier.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE HOME FRONT; 
U.S. Fails to Curb Its Saudi Oil Habit, Experts Say

BYLINE:  By JEFF GERTH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
Nearly a dozen years after the Persian Gulf war, when reliance on Saudi supplies prompted calls for the United States to diversify its sources of oil, America remains as dependent as ever on the Saudis, according to government and industry officials.
 The Saudis supply about one-sixth of United States oil imports. But what gives Saudi Arabia its considerable political strength is its role as the only producer with the spare capacity to replace millions of barrels a day of lost oil. That amount could be drained from the market temporarily by an attack on Iraq, according to the administration's internal assessments as well as outside experts. 
 "The Saudis have by far the largest amount of unused capacity," Guy Caruso, the head of the Energy Department's Energy Information Administration said. 
Relations between Saudi Arabia and the United States have been strained since the participation of several Saudis in the Sept. 11 attacks last year prompted close scrutiny of the country's role in financing and otherwise supporting Islamic radicalism. But the Bush Administration's strategic options are clearly limited by American dependence on Saudi oil.
Saudi Arabia is now producing about eight million barrels a day, oil executives say. Saudi officials have said publicly that they could raise their output to 10 million barrels a day fairly quickly and to 10.5 million within three months. Most experts, as well as the Bush administration, accept the Saudi assurances.
If a war halts Iraq's oil exports -- estimated at 1.5 million to 2 million barrels a day -- the situation will be manageable, Mr. Caruso said. But it would be harder to replace a steeper decline in exports, which could occur if oil supplies from other Persian Gulf producers were reduced by terrorist attacks or by prohibitive insurance premiums on oil tankers.
In an interview, Mr. Caruso said the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve and stocks in other countries represented the other best defense against short-term disruptions. 
Established in the 1970's as a response to an oil embargo by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is based in Kuwait, the reserve now holds a record 592 million barrels, part of a Bush administration plan to reach 700 million barrels by 2005.
But because of increased American dependence on imported oil, the length of time the reserve can compensate for lost imports has declined from a high of 118 days in 1985 to 51 days at the end of last year. Some oil experts advocate increasing the reserve to one billion barrels.
Alan Larson, under secretary of state for economic affairs, went to Saudi Arabia last month to secure assurances that Riyadh would pump extra oil if it were needed, American and Saudi oil executives say.
Last month Mr. Caruso's office helped prepare an "oil market contingency planning" book, based entirely on public data. The Energy Department has restricted the book's distribution to keep it from Congress and the public, according to government officials.
In an interview last month, Mr. Caruso cited a small portion of the book's contents to illustrate the unique role of Saudi Arabia.
Because there are no reporting requirements in the international oil industry, capacity figures vary widely. 
Mr. Caruso's agency estimates that Saudi Arabia has slightly more than half the spare production capacity of 4.5 million to 5 million barrels a day that exists in member nations of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
A group of experts led by Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, estimates that total spare capacity is only three million barrels, and that the Saudis control two-thirds of that.
In the three months after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, the largest oil supply disruption in American history occurred, with the daily shortfall averaging 4.6 million barrels, government records show. 
Prices doubled for a time. But the shortage was largely offset by increased Saudi oil production, which went from 5.8 million barrels a day in August to 8.5 million by December, according to data in Energy Department's oil market contingency planning book.
Some analysts question whether Saudi Arabia actually has the spare capacity it says it has.
"We all take the Saudi assurances for granted," said Matthew Simmons, head of Simmons & Company International, a Houston-based energy advisory firm, but "the last time Saudi Arabia ever got close to 9 or 10 was in 1980. Their largest field is 55 years old, and they do not disclose their field-by-field production data, so we really don't know for sure."
Government and industry oil experts praise the administration for its focus on energy security. But they say it has been too quiet about its plans, given how openly the issue is discussed in the oil markets and the administration's own push for more transparent oil markets.
Administration officials say they have adopted a cautious approach to avoid roiling the markets. "Something said casually could be misinterpreted and influence the markets," said one Energy Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
More than a half-century ago, the United States developed a close relationship with the Saudi ruling family, tacitly if not explicitly trading support for the government for access to oil.
But the events of Sept. 11 raised fresh questions in the United States about Saudi Arabia: 15 hijackers and much of Al Qaeda's finances came from the kingdom. 
On the Saudi side, the American military presence in the country is one factor in the "increasingly open challenges" to the royal family's control, a recently released assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency says.
Both governments insist that the relationship is as strong as ever. But the Pentagon has developed regional alternatives to the use of Saudi military installations, and a draft of a secret Congressional report has criticized the Saudis for not cooperating with Americans investigating the Sept. 11 attacks.
Still, the prospects of a war with Iraq show how oil continues to bind Saudi Arabia's relationship with the United States.
The countries' dealings have always been marked by quiet diplomacy. But according to Bush advisers and officials, the fear that critics would, perhaps unfairly, link the administration's policies to the oil industry has added another layer of secrecy.
"If you are trying to talk about Iraq and if you were not encumbered by the fear that your actions would be linked to Exxon Mobil or the oil industry," said one Bush adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity, "you'd be talking about oil issues."
Vice President Dick Cheney tackled the issue of energy security in the administration's National Energy Policy report. The report noted that Saudi Arabia's policy of "investing in spare oil production capacity" had lessened the impact of oil supply disruptions in any region. 
But the report also called for greater "diversity of world oil production." to avoid possible instability due to "concentration of world oil production in any one region of the world."
After Sept. 11, President Bush decided to increase the American strategic reserve to 700 million barrels. But some experts say more is needed, in part to reduce the importance of Persian Gulf producers like Saudi Arabia.
"You want to make it politically impossible for the Saudis to use their swing capacity as a political club," said James Woolsey, President Clinton's first C.I.A. director and one of the advocates of increasing the reserve to one billion barrels.
President Bush's national security strategy, released in September, proposed to "enhance energy security" by working with allies to "expand the sources and types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere, Africa, Central Asia and the Caspian region." 
The strategy did not mention the Persian Gulf, the source of most of the world's known oil reserves and virtually all of the world's spare oil capacity.
Energy security issues were front and center two weeks ago in Washington at a conference on the economic consequences of an attack on Iraq. The conference was sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
Panel members called for more complete and understandable data on oil markets, a position supported by the Bush administration. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham backed a Saudi initiative in that area during a forum in Japan.
Experts on the panel said Saudi Arabia's stated intention to fill in the supply gaps made the outlook for oil markets more favorable than it was after the sudden Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Moreover, the loss of Iraqi oil exports would be far less than the loss of 4.5 million barrels a day that occurred as a result of Iraq's invasion, which halted Kuwait's production, too.
But the center's analysis included some new problems and a few unknowns. Commercial petroleum stocks are much tighter today than in 1990, and there is less ability to substitute other fuels. 
Furthermore, no one knows what President Saddam Hussein of Iraq might do to his own or his neighbors' oil fields, or whether sympathetic terrorists might hit oil targets in the region.

HEADLINE: US Airways Seeks More Time to File Plan 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ALEXANDRIA, Va. Nov. 25 

 BODY:
US Airways Group Inc. asked a federal bankruptcy judge to extend by one month a deadline for filing its plan to emerge from bankruptcy.
The seventh-largest U.S. airline expects to submit its recovery plan by the end of next month, with the aim of completing its reorganization in the first quarter of 2003, US Airways said in court papers.
 An extension of the plan-filing deadline "will provide a sufficient buffer to further refine, if necessary, a business plan that will allow (US Airways) to compete in today's rapidly changing transportation industry" the company said in a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Alexandria, Va. The airline said creditors and investors may offer further input on the plan. 
 Companies reorganizing in bankruptcy face a 120-day deadline to produce a recovery plan. If the so-called exclusive plan-filing period ends, creditors and shareholders can advance competing proposals, adding costs and potential delays.
US Airways, based in Arlington, filed for Chapter 11 protection in August after losses worsened because of the Sept. 11 attacks, the economy's slide into recession and the failure of a proposed sale to United Airlines parent UAL Corp.
US Airways asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stephen Mitchell for a one-month extension of the plan deadline, which would give the company the sole right to file a proposal through Jan. 31. The deadline is set to expire on Dec. 31 and a hearing on the extension request is scheduled for Dec. 12, according to the filing.
US Airways owes creditors more than $10.7 billion. In the first nine months of this year, the carrier had losses of more than $850 million.
The company's plan to emerge from Chapter 11 is based on an equity investment from Alabama's state pension fund. Last week, US Airways said the Alabama fund was the only bidder in a court-supervised auction to invest in and fund the airline's reorganization.

HEADLINE: An Iraq War Won't Destabilize the Mideast 

BYLINE:  By Reuel Marc Gerecht; Reuel Marc Gerecht is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
Arguments against a war in Iraq often revolve around the belief that an American invasion would destabilize the Middle East. According to this critique, the region is a powder keg of instability that a war, with all its inevitable unintended consequences, could well ignite. The Arab street would rise, radical Islamist recruiters would benefit from yet another grievance and Iraq's fractious citizens -- Arab Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds -- would possibly crack their country apart. Those cracks would spread throughout the region.
 But a war with Iraq might not shake up the Middle East much at all. Most regimes in the area are too stable, strong and clever. For example, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt appears to be vastly more adept than was Mohammed Reza Pahlevi, the shah of Iran. The shah allowed the clerical establishment considerable independence -- and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini used the mosques and religious schools to build his network of revolutionary mullahs. Mr. Mubarak, by contrast, has thoroughly co-opted his religious hierarchy. The Egyptian people may riot over bread subsidies. They hit the streets in great numbers to mourn the passing of a beloved singer. They have not once set Egypt ablaze over the travails of the Palestinians or the bellicose actions of the United States. And Egypt, with its densely urban, youthful and homogeneous population, is perhaps the most likely state in the Middle East to succumb to a popular dissatisfaction rising from the streets. 
 Fears of instability in Saudi Arabia also seem misplaced. The most abused people of the country -- the Shiites of the oil-rich Eastern Province, whom the regime's hard-core Sunni clerics refer to as "dogs" -- aren't going to riot on behalf of Saddam Hussein, who has brutally oppressed his own Shiite majority. And Saddam Hussein has never been a beloved figure in Saudi Arabia, even among Saudis who loathe the United States.
Saudi militancy is mainly financial and expressed through proxies. The Saudis held a telethon to support Palestinian militants. They spend millions of dollars to support organizations that spread hatred of the United States and Israel. Yet they have not once rioted in significant numbers for the Palestinians or against the royal family's American protectors. This is as true for the fundamentalist heartland in the Najd region as it is for the more cosmopolitan Hijaz. Remember, Osama bin Laden stands out among both rich and poor because he is a Saudi who actually did something himself.
Ever since the Iranian revolution, Saudi Arabia's rulers have fine-tuned their internal security and their modus vivendi with the kingdom's radical Islamists, who have been richly endowed over the past two decades. It is very difficult to imagine a Saudi Khomeini -- or a successful conclave of coup-plotting colonels. A second Persian Gulf war just doesn't offer a regime-shaking catalyst that the Saudi dynasty hasn't handled before.
The instability theory doesn't work any better with Turkey and Jordan. Though a war might encourage Iraq's Kurds to express their ethnic identity more forcefully and thus provoke an incursion by a Turkish military fearful of Kurdish nationalism, neither of these is likely. Turkey has come to terms with the self-governing Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq. Slowly, painfully but with increasing astuteness, Turkish society has come to appreciate the differences among the Kurds and how deeply millions of Turkey's Kurds have integrated with the increasingly democratic Turkish republic. Turkish generals, by and large cautious men attuned to popular sentiment, have expressed no desire to occupy northern Iraq. And Iraq's Kurds, repeatedly burned by international politics, are unlikely to risk their self-governing experiment by pressing nationalism too far.
In the event of war, Saddam Hussein may well try to destabilize Jordan, which has close economic ties with Iraq. And many in Jordan's large Palestinian community have lionized the Iraqi dictator as an anti-American, anti-Israeli champion. But it is very doubtful that Jordan's Palestinians think more highly of Saddam Hussein than they do of King Abdullah II. Since 1970, when the Palestine Liberation Organization and Yasir Arafat were ejected from Jordan, Palestinians on the East Bank of the Jordan River have not once gone on a rampage against the Hashemite monarchy. 
The one truly unsettling thing a second Persian Gulf war might unleash is Iraqi democracy. President Bush's rhetoric about Muslims' right to freedom has been unprecedented. Yet the administration has been vague about its aspirations for Iraq after Saddam Hussein. There may be good reasons for this vagueness, but it may also indicate that while promotion of democracy is high on the administration's list of ideals, it is low on the list of priorities.
Practical American support for liberal ideas in the Arab world has been virtually nil. The administration recently faced its first really hard test: Mr. Mubarak's imprisonment of the democracy advocate Saad Eddin Ibrahim, an Egyptian-American. The administration failed to put any serious pressure on Egypt. This is the kind of corrupt stability in the Middle East that does us no honor and ultimately harms our interests. Bin Ladenism's appeal is unlikely to end in a Muslim world dominated by such unchanging despotism.

HEADLINE: Blair Says Firefighters' Demands Threaten Economic Stability 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair intervened directly in the strike by 50,000 firefighters for the first time today, saying he would not endorse a pay raise unless the firefighters radically overhaul the way they work.
 His comments, on the fourth day of an eight-day stoppage, seemed to harden the lines significantly as strikers clustered around fires on chilly picket lines and as 19,000 troops in 50-year-old "Green Goddess" military firetrucks were called to take the place of regular fire crews at blazing houses and highway crashes. 
 The British labor unrest, moreover, coincided with a rash of strikes or threatened stoppages in other European countries, including Belgium, Portugal and France where truck drivers, air-traffic controllers and railroad workers planned protests this week.
Mr. Blair's statements were made both at a hastily scheduled news conference and to Parliament. They suggested that he was staking much personal and political prestige on his ability to avert a repetition of the "winter of discontent" in 1979, when far more widespread public service strikes crippled the nation and sent the Labor Party into opposition for 18 years. 
"Those days are over," he told reporters at 10 Downing Street. "They are not coming back -- not under this government, not under any government."
But even as he spoke, thousands of teachers and municipal workers were set to walk off their jobs in a 24-hour strike on Tuesday, deepening the sense of unrest.
Since he took over the party in 1994, Mr. Blair has made it a hallmark of his "New Labor" to stand firm against militant workers, breaking his party's historic covenant with the unions and drawing comparisons with the conservative Margaret Thatcher's battle with union power in the 1980's. The firefighters' strike is the most serious challenge from organized labor since Mr. Blair became prime minister five years ago.
"This is a strike they can't succeed in," he said today. "It would not be a defeat for the government. It would be a defeat for the country."
The firefighters had been demanding a 40 percent pay increase. They had seemed ready to accept an offer from their local government employers last Friday of 16 percent over two years when the government vetoed it on the ground that it would cost too much. The firefighters' basic pay is currently $33,000 a year -- higher than that of some other public service workers.
Despite a weekend of conflicting signals from government ministers, Mr. Blair insisted that any unconditional pay raise for the firefighters would bring similar demands from other discontented public service workers like nurses, teachers and police officers. That, in turn, he said, would jeopardize the entire British economy, which has survived the global slowdown in better shape than many others in Europe or the United States.
"If we were to yield to this claim, made in this way at this time, we would do fundamental and lasting economic damage to the economic stability -- low inflation, low unemployment, low mortgage rates -- we have fought so long and hard to achieve as a country," Mr. Blair said.
At a separate meeting in Manchester, Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, drew applause from business leaders when he, too, pledged, "We will not take any risks with stability."
Repeatedly, Mr. Blair insisted that any pay increase beyond 4 percent would have to be linked to what he termed "modernization." The term has become a code word for ending various practices, like providing four days off for firefighters who have worked two day shifts and two night shifts, not requiring full-time firefighters to work alongside part-time colleagues, and barring overtime shifts scheduled in advance.
The government says that making changes would save money to finance a bigger pay increase. But Andy Gilchrist, the firefighters' union leader, said Mr. Blair's proposals represented "a cuts agenda," to reduce the fire service payroll in return for higher individual wages. "It is sad and disappointing that the government is not telling the truth," he said.
On the picket lines, firefighters reacted angrily to Mr. Blair's comments. "This is Blair throwing down the gauntlet to all public sector workers," said Chris McGlone, a firefighter in Glasgow. 
In the British Midlands, Martin Lewis said: "We are not the bully boys. They are the bully boys."
The current strike follows a two-day stoppage earlier this month. Two more eight-day walk-outs are scheduled before Dec. 24. In a survey today by interactive Sky television, 56 percent of 67,000 viewers who responded said they opposed the strike, with 44 percent in favor.
"The two-day strike was wrong and dangerous," Mr. Blair said, "and it follows that an eight-day strike is more so." 
In the first stoppage, seven people died in fires -- higher than the annual average for that time period -- but that number has fallen back to five in the first four days of the second strike.

HEADLINE: Treasury Chief Promises New Economic Plan 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, England, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
President Bush will offer a plan to help accelerate the United States economic recovery, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said today.
 Forecasts are for growth to slow in the fourth quarter to about half the 3.1 percent annual rate of expansion from July to September. That is slower than the 3 to 3.5 percent range Mr. O'Neill once predicted. 
 "Early next year President Bush will propose new action for economic growth and job creation," Mr. O'Neill said in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry. He did not specify what actions Mr. Bush might suggest.
With a Republican-controlled Congress taking office in January, Mr. Bush has said he will seek to make last year's $1.35 trillion tax cut permanent.
The administration has been getting advice on other possible steps. Businesses are seeking a 75 percent write-off for equipment purchases and changes in rules that will require them to pay billions of dollars to shore up their pension plans. Investors want to end the so-called double taxation of dividends.
On Capitol Hill, Republicans may try to speed up parts of last year's tax cut for individuals that are being phased in and to make permanent provisions that are set to expire. Democrats want to increase the minimum wage, extend jobless benefits and temporarily suspend Social Security taxes to put cash into workers' pockets.
Mr. O'Neill has suggested that he prefers narrowly aimed tax cuts to broad-based reductions because only parts of the economy are weak.
"The tougher part has been building broad-based momentum throughout the economy," he told the British business leaders. "Some sectors have been doing well, such as housing and auto manufacturing, while others, such as commercial airplane manufacturing and airline services, have lagged."
Mr. O'Neill said he was also continuing to draft proposals to reduce the length of the tax law and free billions of dollars for investment. If the tax system were simplified, he said, the United States could recover an estimated $400 billion a year that is now lost to tax avoidance and the cost of complying with the tax laws. Mr. O'Neill, who again called the United States tax system "an abomination," said Mr. Bush shared his view that the tax code was too complicated. He stopped short of saying the president would endorse a complete overhaul, however.
Mr. O'Neill cited low inflation, lean inventories, rising incomes, a 5.7 percent unemployment rate and the largest annual gain in productivity since 1983 as evidence of economic strength. 
Creation of a homeland security department, terrorism risk insurance and the lowest Federal Reserve interest rates for 41 years have helped underpin the economy, he said.

HEADLINE: Positive Ratings For the G.O.P., If Not Its Policy 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
Three weeks after Republicans captured control of the government, Americans hold favorable views of the party and President Bush, but they are less enthusiastic about some of the policies Republicans are promoting, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 They are ambivalent about tax cuts, concerned about Republican plans for Social Security and strongly opposed to the administration's environmental policies. 
 At the same time, nearly half of the respondents expressed an unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party -- the highest percentage with such a view since 1996. Americans said Democrats had failed to offer a plan for the future or a reason to vote against Republicans in this latest campaign, suggesting that the election's outcome was as much a testament to what Democrats did wrong as to what Republicans did right.
In a measure of additional concern for Democrats, Al Gore, who is the best-known Democrat who might run for president in 2004, is viewed unfavorably today by a ratio of almost two to one, despite a weeklong bath of favorable publicity that accompanied his national tour promoting two new books about the American family. 
Nearly two-thirds of all respondents, including just over 50 percent of Democrats, said that Mr. Gore should step aside and allow someone else to run against Mr. Bush.
The poll's finding strongly suggests that Mr. Bush's popularity -- he has a 65 percent job approval rating -- and heavy schedule of campaign appearances contributed to the strong Republican showing on Election Day. Among those who voted Republican, 55 percent described their vote as being cast in support of Mr. Bush; 37 percent of those who voted Democratic described their vote as being against the president.
The Times/CBS News poll was intended to assess the dynamics of the midterm Congressional elections and to compensate for the loss of data caused by the breakdown of the polling system run by the Voter News Service. This poll is not a substitute for that kind of systematic canvassing of voters as they leave voting booths. Nonetheless it offers a picture of public sentiment in the aftermath of an election that rocked the Democrats and put the Republicans in charge of Congress, while leading to assertions by some senior Republicans that the nation was undergoing a political alignment toward their party.
The findings suggest limits to the mandate that some Republicans have claimed for Mr. Bush as a result of the Republican sweep of the November elections. The poll found that the once solidly Democratic South had a higher opinion of the Republican Party than the rest of the nation, reflecting a geographical alignment that both parties have noted over the last 20 years. But it stopped short of suggesting that an ideological transformation was at hand, given respondents' views on what have emerged as touchstone Republican issues this year.
Those polled did not appear to be particularly happy about how the election turned out: just 37 percent described themselves as pleased, compared with 26 percent who said they were disappointed. By contrast, in 1994, the last time Republicans took control of Congress, providing a Republican counterpart to President Bill Clinton's White House, nearly 50 percent of those surveyed described themselves as pleased with the outcome.
As such, the findings appear to be something of a cautionary note to Republicans, particularly at a time when some party members have warned Republican Congressional leaders against moving too aggressively in pushing the party agenda.
The nationwide telephone poll of 996 adults was taken from Wednesday through Sunday. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Mr. Bush remains extremely popular. Still, on a number of issues, there was evidence of public ambivalence or, in some cases, opposition to policies that the White House has signaled it will pursue once Republicans assume control in January.
For example, 55 percent of respondents said they disapproved of the White House effort to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, compared with 39 percent who approved. Nearly two-thirds said the federal government should do more to regulate the environmental and safety practices of business. 
By a ratio of two to one, Americans said they thought that protecting the environment was more important than producing energy. By a seven-to-one ratio, respondents said that Mr. Bush believed that producing energy was more important than protecting the environment.
"I don't like what he's doing to the environment, really," said James Stranz, 57, a Republican unemployed laborer from Philadelphia. "I don't think we should be ruining the environment just because big business wants more oil."
Mr. Stranz added, "I support Bush because Bush didn't back down with Afghanistan."
Mr. Bush's enthusiasm for his $1.25 trillion tax cut plan is also not entirely shared by the public. Two-thirds said they would have preferred the federal surplus be used to shore up Social Security and Medicare rather than finance a tax cut. With the surplus gone, 48 percent of those polled said they did not believe it was possible to both cut taxes and reduce the federal budget deficit; 42 percent said they believed it was possible. But the respondents were evenly divided about whether they preferred to focus on reducing the deficit or cutting taxes.
Nearly 60 percent said they believed that Mr. Bush's tax cut benefited the wealthy; just over 25 percent said it benefited the middle class. Four percent said the tax cut primarily benefited the poor. Three-quarters of respondents said that the first round of tax cuts had not made a noticeable difference in their paychecks.
Americans are also evenly divided about whether future retirees should be permitted to invest part of their Social Security taxes in private accounts, as is strongly supported by Mr. Bush and many Congressional Republicans. At the same time, more than half of the respondents said they did not expect the Social Security system to be able to pay them benefits owed by the time they retire.
Despite Mr. Bush's strong standing with the American public, there were glimmers of hope for the Democrats as they begin preparing a case against Mr. Bush for the 2004 presidential race. Respondents were evenly divided when asked if they had confidence about his ability to make the right decisions about the nation's finances.
Just over half said they were confident in Mr. Bush's ability to handle an international crisis, a relatively small increase, considering what the last two years have been like; 45 percent said the same thing when Mr. Bush took office in 2001.
The findings about Mr. Gore would seem unwelcome news to the former vice president and his advisers as he begins what he describes as a final round of deliberations about another run for the presidency. If he chooses to run, he faces what he described in an interview last week as a virtually start-from-scratch round of fund-raising calls, which could be complicated by a perception that he is a weakened candidate.
The poll was taken just as Mr. Gore was riding a wave of nationwide publicity as part of his book promotion tour. Even Mr. Gore's potential rivals predicted that the exposure would improve his standing among the American people.
So far, that appears not to be the case. Just 19 percent said they held a favorable view of the former vice president, compared with 43 percent who had an unfavorable view. The unfavorable rating is among his worst since The New York Times/CBS News Poll began asking the question about him in 1987. Men are more likely than woman to dislike Mr. Gore. 
The unfavorable perception of Mr. Gore crossed party lines: about one-third of Democrats viewed him favorably, compared with about one-fifth who viewed him unfavorably. Of potentially more concern to Mr. Gore, just 17 percent of independent voters said they had a favorable opinion of him, compared with 36 percent who described their view as unfavorable.
"I know that Gore is going around now in all these public places and trying to establish an agenda, but I don't believe he can," said Phyllis Snyder, 68, a Democrat from Summit, Ark. "I just don't believe he can win. I think people are tired of Al Gore. I don't they want Al Gore. "
In another follow-up interview, Wayne Denson, 75, a Democrat and retired optician from Kansas City, Mo., said: "I voted for him to start with but now that Bush got elected, I'd rather vote for Bush than Gore. Bush has got more intelligence."
A spokesman for Mr. Gore, Jano Cabrera, said he was not concerned about the findings, saying it was still early in the race. "With two years to go, realistically speaking, none of these measurements mean much," Mr. Cabrera said. "More importantly, Gore realizes that if he runs he will be starting from scratch and will have to earn every vote."

HEADLINE: Council Affirms Deep Cuts and 18% Property Tax Rise 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The City Council voted overwhelmingly yesterday to raise the city's property tax rate by 18.5 percent and to cut spending by more than $840 million after reaching an agreement with the Bloomberg administration to restore cuts to some key services.
 The final tally was 41 to 6, with 4 council members absent. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's fellow Republicans on the Council abandoned him: all three who were present voted against the property tax increase he had sought. They were joined by three dissenting Democrats, two from Queens and one from Brooklyn. 
 Voting to raise the city's property tax for the first time in more than a decade was not easy, especially with less than a year to go before the council members face re-election. In speeches before and during the vote, many cited the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, calling the increase a "war tax." Some faulted former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, saying that he had left the city's budget unbalanced. Others said that Gov. George E. Pataki and the federal government had not done enough to help New York City.
Speaker Gifford Miller said that approving the tax increase was hard, but necessary to balance the budget while keeping city services at an acceptable level. "There is no Hail Mary pass," he said. "There is no silver bullet. It is this simple: we must find the money to pay for those things that we feel we must pay for."
Many council members pointed with pride to the city services that they had fought successfully to preserve, including City University of New York scholarships, 37 ambulance shifts, 2,500 day care slots, weekend meals for the elderly, library service and a program to reduce infant mortality. Charles Barron, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said, "I'm voting yes to CUNY students getting their scholarships for the spring semester."
All told, the Council won agreements from the Bloomberg administration to restore $50.2 million in planned cuts. To offset those cuts, the Council said that money could come from savings on heat, light and power, debt service and alternative cuts, as well as revenue increases. But many of these represent either one-time infusions of revenue, which will not save more money next year, or things that the city would presumably have done anyway.
The effects of the property tax increase will depend on the kind of home or apartment that a person lives in. People living in an average single-family home will see their tax bills rise this year to $2,024 from $1,853; people in an average co-op will see their bills go to $2,931 from $2,683; people in condominiums will see an average rise to $4,939 from $4,521. The increases will be larger next year, when they will be in effect for a full year instead of half a year.
At the end of the day, both sides of City Hall could claim a measure of victory. The mayor had prodded council members to raise property taxes significantly as they face re-election, and the Council had prevailed on the mayor to restore many cuts. 
But with the city facing a $6.4 billion shortfall in the fiscal year that begins on July 1, in just over seven months, some budget analysts said that the victory could be short-lived. Some questioned whether the city had cut its expenses enough.
During the summer, Mayor Bloomberg called on all city agencies to reduce their spending by 7.5 percent so that the city could save $1.1 billion and apply it to next year's deficits. By the fall, two things had happened. The mayor announced that the city had sprung a $1.1 billion leak in the current year, because of the sluggish economy. And many big agencies -- including the Police, Fire and Education Departments -- fell short of their cutting goals, saying that they could not save more money without harming services.
So when the mayor presented his midyear adjustment to the budget earlier this month, he called for raising the property tax rate by 25 percent and for making $844 million in budget cuts, new revenues and adjustments. Under that plan, the city would have ended the year with an $804 million surplus, to get a head start next year.
The Council negotiated the administration down to an 18.49 percent increase, which will give the city $837 million in the remainder of this year, and $1.7 billion next year. (The increase was originally announced as 18 percent, officials explained, because they were rounding the number down.) The budget adjustment that the Council voted on yesterday will whittle this year's surplus down to $507 million, city officials said.
That leaves the city with an enormous hole to fill next year. Even if the city's revenue projections are overly cautious, and the city ends this year with a larger surplus, it will be difficult to close a $6.4 billion gap without more drastic measures.
Mayor Bloomberg has proposed restructuring the city's income tax by cutting the tax for city residents, but charging the same tax to commuters who work in the city but live outside it. The city is counting on $1 billion from the new system to help plug next year's gap. But Governor Pataki and Republicans in the State Senate, whose permission would be needed, have just about ruled it out. 
Now, many council members say they expect they may have to raise personal income taxes on city residents next year. Asked if people are going to get higher taxes next year, Mayor Bloomberg said, "Oh, I think there's no question that they are."
But he continued in such a way as to make it clear that he was still talking about his plan to tax commuters. "That's why we're going to Albany, and we've proposed a sharing of the burden at the personal income tax level."
When the Council's Finance Committee met yesterday to approve the package before it went before the whole Council, a representative of the real estate industry warned council members that the higher taxes could force jobs out of the city. Advocates for children and health care, on the other hand, praised the Council for restoring cuts.
Some council members said they thought their constituents would understand the increase when they understood the city's position. As Yvette D. Clarke of Brooklyn put it: "We are broke. This city is broke."

HEADLINE: Canada's Oil Sector Fights Pollution Plan 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
When Canadian oil executives get together with politicians and investors these days, the talk is less likely to be about drilling results or royalties than about climate change.
 The oil executives have become the most outspoken critics in Canada of plans by Prime Minister Jean Chretien to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 pact that calls for developed nations to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which most scientists consider the main cause of global warming. 
 The Canadian Parliament began debating the treaty today, and ratification is likely by mid-December. Mr. Chretien's ruling Liberal Party has a large majority in the House of Commons, and opinion polls indicate that the Kyoto treaty enjoys wide support among Canadians. 
But the oil industry -- strongly backed by Ralph Klein, the premier of Alberta, the main oil- and gas-producing province -- says Kyoto is a threat. It says the cost of complying will make it hard for Canadian companies to compete or to attract new investment.
The government responded last week by significantly modifying its proposals for putting the treaty into effect. FirstEnergy Capital of Calgary said in a report today that the changes, which include extending deadlines for companies that have trouble finding the capital or the technology to meet emission targets, "will make implementation less onerous to oil and gas producers than first thought."
The Kyoto treaty takes effect after it has been ratified by 55 countries, which must include developed nations accounting for at least 55 percent of that group's 1990 carbon monoxide emissions. Some 97 countries have approved so far, but most of them are small, and they represent only about 37 percent of the required emissions total. Canada would raise the figure to about 41 percent.
With the Bush administration opposed to the treaty, the most important nation considering ratification is Russia, which would raise the emissions figure by 17.4 percent, enough to bring it into force. The White House opposes the Kyoto protocol because it argues that the treaty's binding limits on greenhouse-gas emissions could harm the American economy and because fast-growing economic powers like China and India are exempted.
The Canadian oil executives say Canada would bear a disproportionately heavy burden if it is the only country in the Western Hemisphere bound by the emission targets, as now seems likely.
Several companies have recently said the treaty was the reason they had decided to scale back some operations in Canada. Earlier this month, Canadian Natural Resources of Calgary said it was reducing the 2003 capital budget for its Horizon oil-sands project in northern Alberta by one-third, or 100 million Canadian dollars ($63.4 million), "pending clarification of the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol."
Analysts expect that oil-sands projects will be hit hardest because turning bitumen, a thick form of petroleum, into oil yields a relatively large amount of pollution.
Under the Kyoto accord, Canada would have to reduce its emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 6 percent from 1990 levels annually from 2008 to 2012. But that figure understates the true scale of the reduction required in Canada because emissions have grown significantly since 1990. 
Canadian companies could offset emissions by buying "credits" from countries like Russia and Germany, where closings of old, inefficient plants have already reduced emissions from 1990 levels.
That provision, too, has rankled energy executives. Gwyn Morgan, chief executive of EnCana, one of western Canada's biggest oil and gas producers, asked in a recent speech to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, "At a time when we have run out of money to fund health care, why would we sign up to slow down our economy and to send money to Russia for credits?"
Gregory Pardy, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs in New York, called the Kyoto Protocol "a national public issue" for Canadians. "It creates uncertainty for American fund managers making investments in Canada," Mr. Pardy said. "What is not clear at the moment is what the distribution of costs will be between shareholders and Canadian taxpayers."
FirstEnergy Capital has said the six companies with the most to worry about are Canadian Natural Resources, Canadian Oil Sands Trust, the Imperial Oil unit of Exxon Mobil, Shell Canada, Suncor Energy and Western Oil Sands.
As an alternative to Kyoto, the energy executives are pushing for a "made in Canada" solution to global warming -- one that would include "sensible emission improvement targets with regulatory backstops," according to Pierre R. Alvarez, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.
"It's not a question of doing something or doing nothing," he said.
Many oil and gas producers say they are already making progress in reducing emissions. Petro-Canada, for instance, estimates that it has eliminated more than 1.2 million metric tons of greenhouse-gas pollutants since 1990, the equivalent of taking 150,000 full-size cars off the road each year.
The government estimated last month that the cost of meeting the Kyoto targets would be 3 Canadian cents a barrel for conventional crude oil, and 10 to 12 Canadian cents a barrel for oil produced from oil sands. The extra cost to motorists would be a small fraction of 1 cent a gallon.
Based on these estimates, Tyler Dann, an energy analyst at Banc of America Securities in Houston, said that ratification of the treaty "does not seem to be a big deal at all."
Even some energy companies are taking a conciliatory approach. "We'll align with whatever governments determine to be the public interest," said Gordon Lambert, vice president for sustainable development at Suncor Energy, which owns one of the biggest oil-sands operations and is one of a handful of oil companies not opposing the treaty. 
Mr. Lambert said Suncor would have little trouble meeting the Kyoto targets. The company has already cut its emissions 42 percent from 1990 levels, and it plans to spend 100 million Canadian dollars on alternative and renewable energy projects from 2000 to 2005. Among other things, Suncor has built a power plant fired by natural gas for its oil-sands operation.
Mr. Dann, the Houston analyst, said the Canadian oil industry's opposition was partly posturing.
The profitability of some oil-sands projects is currently threatened by cost overruns and by a predicted North American surplus of the type of oil they produce. "Those companies could be using Kyoto as an excuse to back away from projects that might not go ahead anyway," Mr. Dann said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE INSPECTIONS; 
U.N. MONITOR SAYS IRAQIS ARE DENYING HAVING ARMS CACHE

BYLINE:  By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
Iraqi officials have told United Nations inspectors in Baghdad that they have no weapons of mass destruction and expressed reservations about inspections of President Saddam Hussein's palaces, Hans Blix, one of the inspections chiefs, said here today. 
 Briefing the Security Council, Mr. Blix said Iraqi officials had pledged to cooperate fully with the inspections, but had also raised a host of skeptical questions about a declaration of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons due on Dec. 8. 
 Suggesting that the declaration was too broad to finish by that deadline, the Iraqis wondered if they had to include every detail of their civilian chemical industries, down to "the production of plastic slippers," Mr. Blix said. 
He said he had responded with a curt warning that if Iraq was going to claim to be clean, it would have to provide convincing evidence. 
The weapons chief gave a glimpse of his tough stance and Iraq's ambivalent reaction in his first report to the Council since he and Mohamed ElBaradei, the top nuclear inspector, traveled to Baghdad a week ago, beginning a new round of inspections after a four-year hiatus. The first contingent of 19 United Nations experts arrived in Baghdad today, saying they planned to conduct the first inspections on Wednesday. 
On a day when many Council nations expected a show of unity to support the inspections, some diplomats were surprised that the United States wanted to add several items that it said could be used for military purposes to a list of restricted imports to Iraq.
When debate produced no accord on whether or how to revise the list, the Council voted tonight to extend the mandate for United Nations monitoring of Iraqi oil sales until Dec. 4. It was set to expire at midnight tonight.
The program, called oil for food, uses Iraqi oil revenues to buy food, medicine and other civilian goods for the population.
At the behest of the Pentagon, American officials said, the United States ambassador here, John D. Negroponte, insisted on adding several medical and communications items to the list of goods that must pass United Nations review. They included global positioning scanning devices, equipment to jam radio intercepts and special 7-inch injectors to administer the drug atropine, as well as the drug itself. It is used to resuscitate heart attack patients, but can also be a treatment for victims of attacks with chemical nerve agents.
The United States was also seeking to block large-scale imports of Cipro, a strong antibiotic that can be used to treat anthrax infection, administration officials said.
Mr. Negroponte said the United States believed that those goods "did not have a benign, civilian or purely humanitarian purpose." He said Washington insisted on extending the debate for nine days in order to set a timetable for revising the list of goods before it would approve renewing the oil-for-food program.
Other Council diplomats were frustrated that the United States insisted on the revisions to the list as the deadline approached. The list has been the subject of long and contentious debate in the past, and most Council nations were hoping to avoid getting into it again until sometime next year, to avoid undermining the weapons inspections.
"We would like to have a solution to this, and everybody must try to come together," Ambassador Peter Ole Kolby of Norway said in support of the program, with a diplomatic hint of frustration.
Mr. Blix said he had told Iraq to expect aggressive surprise inspections.
"The Council has authorized us to go anywhere anytime, and we intend to do so without telling anyone in advance," Mr. Blix said he had informed Iraq, in comments that were praised by American officials. 
While saying they would do nothing to delay the inspections, the Iraqi officials, led by Gen. Amir Hammudi al-Saadi, also observed that entering "into a presidential site or a ministry was not exactly the same thing as entry into a factory."
Resolution 1441, adopted unanimously by the Council on Nov. 8 to give the inspectors a new, forceful mandate, authorizes them to inspect the vast compounds around Mr. Hussein's nine palaces.
Most Council nations were pleased by Mr. Blix's report, which was endorsed by Mr. ElBaradei, that the inspections were moving forward as planned in the resolution.
"So far so good," said the Chinese ambassador, Wang Yingfan, speaking for the 15-nation Council.
But differences among the Council powers surfaced in the discussion after Mr. Blix's briefing, diplomats said. The Russian ambassador, Sergey Lavrov, took issue with Mr. Blix's statement that "many governments" believed that there were still programs to build weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
"I can only think of a few," Mr. Lavrov said, according to diplomats in the session, making it clear that Russia was not one of them.
Mr. Blix noted that the inspections teams would begin their work 19 days after Resolution 1441 was passed, considerably faster than the 45 days the Security Council allowed. He said he and Mr. ElBaradei expected to provide a comprehensive report to the Council on their progress on Jan. 27.
He said the inspection chiefs had stressed that Iraq's Dec. 8 declaration had to be complete, disclosing any prohibited program. He said past declarations by Iraq "left it an open question whether some weapons remained."
Mr. Blix said today that the Iraqis acknowledged that there were some discrepancies and gaps about long-range missiles in documents they had already provided to the inspectors. Iraqi officials volunteered to correct the information soon.
Secretary General Kofi Annan received only today an 11-page letter Iraq sent to him on Saturday picking apart the Council resolution clause by clause, calling it a violation of international law and an excuse for the United States to go to war.
Speaking in Paris, Mr. Annan said Iraq should cooperate with the inspections. "That is the only way to avoid conflict in the region," he said.
Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the nuclear inspectors, said in Baghdad that they would carry out the inspections with "suspicious minds," on the lookout for Iraqi deception.
Mr. ElBaradei, in Cairo, reminded Baghdad that if the inspectors gave a positive report, their work could be "an alternative to war, not a precursor to war." --------------------

Support From Britain
 LONDON, Nov. 25 (AP) -- Britain's Parliament declared its support today for the United Nations Security Council resolution on Iraq, despite rumblings of dissent over the manner in which military action would be decided.
The decision came after Prime Minister Tony Blair warned that President Hussein would face "serious consequences" if he denied that Iraq possessed banned weapons.
"We have no doubt he does have weapons of mass destruction," Mr. Blair said at a news conference. "So let's wait and see what he actually says."
After five hours of debate in the House of Commons, a motion by Mr. Blair's government in favor of United Nations Resolution 1441 was approved without a vote when the legislators called out their approval with a shout of "Aye."
Shortly before, an amendment requiring parliamentary approval for any use of British troops -- and urging a new Security Council mandate for military action to enforce Resolution 1441 -- was defeated by a vote of 452 to 85.
The supporters of the amendment, proposed by the opposition Liberal Democrats, included 32 members of Mr. Blair's Labor Party.
Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons that it would be "utterly irresponsible" to offer legislators a vote to pre-approve military action if it would put lives of British forces at risk.

HEADLINE: An Indian Food Company Expands 

BYLINE:  BySARITHA RAI 

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
For the thousands of Indian soldiers facing off with Pakistan in the heights of the Himalayas, much sustenance comes in the form of packaged foods made by MTR Foods Ltd. For civilians in parts of southern India, the company's offerings are ubiquitous, too.
 Now MTR Foods, which grew out of a restaurant in Bangalore that has served south Indian delicacies since colonial days, is hoping to find a place at the dinner table of civilians throughout India and in the West as well. In fact, armed with two new global food industry seals of approval, MTR has grand plans for eventually becoming the McDonald's of Indian food. 
 "We will open franchisee restaurants in India and abroad, standardized around our frozen-food products like the dosa," a rice and lentil crepe, said Sadananda Maiya, the company's chairman and managing director. 
The company recently sold a 28 percent stake to J. P. Morgan Partners, the private equity arm of J. P. Morgan Chase, for $4 million, money that Mr. Maiya says will be used for expansion and marketing.
India's food industry is a new draw for foreign investors looking to go beyond the country's high-technology industry into newer, fast-growing segments of the economy.
"The changing food habits of the Indian consumer and the importance of convenience foods in a homemaker's life makes MTR an extremely promising investment," said Anil Ahuja, chief executive of J. P. Morgan Partners Advisers in Singapore, which advises Morgan on investments in the region.
Morgan has also invested in Domino's Pizza India.
The country's packaged-foods market is new, going back only about a decade and a half, and MTR is one of just a few big brands. The domestic market for packaged foods, which includes processed, ready-to-eat and convenience -- or partly cooked -- foods, is still quite small, estimated around $31.2 million. But with lifestyles and income levels changing, and as more and more Indian women enter the work force, the market is expected to triple by 2004.
MTR, however, is hoping to tap a much bigger market: the global market for packaged goods, with estimated sales of $680 billion a year.
The company qualified this year under both the I.S.O. 9002 and the Hazard Analysis Critical Central Point -- rigorous global standards of food safety and hygiene. These certifications make it much easier to sell overseas. MTR is the first Indian processed-foods company to receive them.
They are already opening up doors for MTR to the West.
Thanks to MTR's recent tie-up with a supplier to supermarkets in the United States owned by the Kroger Company, the Cincinnati-based grocery retailer, single-serving cans of regional Indian delicacies like palak paneer (cottage cheese cooked in pureed spinach) and aloo mutter (potatoes and peas in spices) will soon appear on American shelves.
MTR has also snared orders to supply bulk ready-to-use spices to Centura Foods, the largest maker of cooking sauces in Britain. It is also exploring a processed-foods marketing arrangement in France.
The export market looks promising, said Sapna Naik, senior food researcher at the Indian unit of the Dutch bank Rabobank International. "The popularity of ethnic Indian food is rising not just among expatriate Indians but also among mainstream populations in Europe and the United States," she said.
Befitting its international ambitions, MTR Foods, which had been run by the founding Maiya family, recently hired its first professional chief executive, J. Suresh. Mr. Suresh had been head of the beverage business of the local Unilever subsidiary, Hindustan Lever Ltd.
The company is an offshoot of a small Bangalore restaurant that opened its doors in 1924 and was later named MTR. (The "T" stands for "tiffin," or light meal.)
The businesses are now separate corporate entities, owned by different branches of the family, and there are stark contrasts -- as well as some significant similarities -- between the humble restaurant and the ambitious food company.
The former is still just a single, small operation, situated in the same nondescript building where it started 78 years ago. For the restaurant's popular, moderately priced five-course meal, diners must pay their 75 rupees ($1.56) in advance to a cashier sitting in a grilled enclosure. Alcohol and meat are not served, and credit cards are not accepted.
Despite the lack of frills, here in India's technology capital, MTR is a cultural icon, known for food that is wholesome and tasty. Regular patrons include movie stars and top politicians, who stand in line waiting for a table.
MTR might have remained just a famous restaurant but for a twist of fate. When Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed emergency rule in 1975, restaurants were subjected to stringent price controls. The Maiyas shut their restaurant, saying they would rather close than compromise on food quality to conform to low prices. To keep busy during the 19-month emergency rule, the Maiyas had their workers prepare food mixes.
The offerings of MTR Foods have since grown to include a variety of snacks, pickles, ice creams and ready-to-eat vegetarian dishes, competing in the highly segmented food market with products from multinationals like Hindustan Lever and Nestle.
In 2000, MTR Foods sold a 20 percent stake to the Magnus Capital Corporation, a Mauritius-based venture capital fund owned by expatriate Indians in Singapore. That stake dropped to 14 percent as the company issued additional shares to sell the 28 percent stake to J. P. Morgan. The rest is held by the Maiya family.
The packaged-foods business is giving the same attention to quality and detail that made the restaurant a celebrated brand.
MTR Foods is based in a pink building in a quiet Bangalore suburb. For the last year it has been busy upgrading its seven factories to snare the food standards certification. Among the changes, single entries have replaced multiple entry points, a changing room was built for employees, and uniforms are sterilized daily.
"We were perhaps the first Indian restaurant in history to introduce the steam sterilization method in our restaurant, in 1951, and we now have become the first food company to receive the demanding certification," Mr. Maiya, an engineer by training, said.
To make the factory 100 percent microbe-free daily, the company adopted a technology developed by India's defense laboratories. MTR Foods integrated this technology so well that the company was awarded a contract to supply ready-to-eat foods to Indian soldiers.
Lately, Mr. Suresh, the new chief executive, has been busy lining up recipe trials in the first MTR fast-food restaurant-cum-store in Bangalore. Two more such enterprises are set to open here this month followed by about 10 more in Indian cities like Delhi, Bombay and Chennai by March. MTR Foods is expecting sales of about $26 million in the current fiscal year, which ends in March, up from $8.95 million in the year ended in March 2000.
Mr. Suresh said MTR's aim was to have revenue of 5 billion rupees ($104 million) in five years, with 20 percent coming from exports.
Such numbers are music to the ears of Mr. Ahuja of J. P. Morgan Partners Advisers, who has some numbers of his own.
"The developed markets, especially the United States and the United Kingdom, are extremely large," he said, and sales of packaged foods in India "could run into billions of dollars."

HEADLINE: Europe Votes To Overhaul Antitrust Regulations 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER with PAUL MELLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
Seeking to channel its energy into uncovering price-fixing arrangements and breaking up cartels, the European Union approved a landmark overhaul of its antitrust laws today.
 The new laws, adopted by a vote of the economics ministers of the union's 15 member nations, will shift much of the responsibility for regulating ties between companies away from the European Commission and back to individual countries and their courts. 
 Freed from the burden of having to review and approve every proposed joint venture or strategic alliance, authorities in Brussels will be able to concentrate on attacking illegal cartels, which still skew competition in Europe.
"The new regulation cuts back this bureaucracy and allows the commission to focus its attention on these cartel and price-fixing agreements that are truly harmful to competition," said Mario Monti, the European Union's competition commissioner. 
Along with a reduction in their workload, the commission's investigators won broader powers in pursuing companies suspected of wrongdoing. They can now raid the homes and cars of executives to search for documents or other evidence, as long as they obtain a warrant from a local court.
As the fines imposed in European cartel cases have escalated into the hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years, more executives have been stashing incriminating documents outside their offices.
These new powers provoked howls of protest from European business lobbyists. They say the commission will be free to invade homes and question employees of a suspect's family, without having to meet a requirement of probable cause, as American investigators must.
"People won't have the right to remain silent," said Ulrike Suchsland-Maser, a spokeswoman for the Federation of German Industries, which represents about 700 German companies. "Even housekeepers will have to answer questions during these home searches."
The European Union's competition authority has suffered setbacks in court recently in its regulation of mergers, but price fixing has been a rich target. In 2001, the commission fined Roche of Switzerland, BASF of Germany and other drug companies more than $850 million for conspiring to fix the prices and market shares of vitamin products in the 1990's.
Still, Europe remains a far more forgiving place than the United States for people engaged in price fixing and other abuses. No European court has yet sent an executive to prison on a conviction. And the new rules, which are scheduled to take effect in May 2004, do not provide for prison time.
"The fines are now approaching U.S. levels, but except for the U.K., which just introduced criminal legislation, there is no social stigma attached to price fixing in Europe," said Julian Joshua, who spent 25 years as an investigator in the commission's anti-cartel unit.
Mr. Joshua, who now advises companies at the Brussels office of the law firm of Howrey Simon Arnold & White, said the broader powers would help investigators crack increasingly sophisticated cartels.
"When you make things illegal, they tend to go more underground, become more furtive," he said.
Companies are also worried because the new laws do not extend attorney-client privilege to in-house lawyers. In the United States, antitrust authorities cannot seize information exchanged between in-house lawyers and their colleagues. But such documents are fair game in Europe.
Given that many cartels are international, involving both American and European companies, Mr. Joshua said, Americans may find that European authorities have seized and exposed information from their European partners that would have been protected in the United States.
The new statute also makes explicit the authority of the commission to impose "structural" remedies, like breaking up a company, when a monopoly position is abused. Such a step is being considered against Microsoft, which is still under antitrust scrutiny here.
"Companies are right to be apprehensive, but I do think the commission is making the right move," said Alec J. Burnside, an expert in antitrust law at the Linklaters law firm in Brussels.
Mr. Burnside said it no longer made sense for the commission to approve every joint venture, research and development project or distribution deal between companies. As in the United States, he said, companies should regulate themselves under a clear set of unionwide rules.
"The E.U. found themselves rubber-stamping agreements, because the companies know how to write the applications," he said.
Enforcing the laws would become the responsibility of national governments and courts. Intentionally, the new law will take effect on the day that 10 new members are scheduled to join the European Union. That raises the prospect of 25 jurisdictions, with their own languages and legal systems, enforcing the same laws.
Ms. Suchsland-Maser predicted widespread confusion and duplicated effort, as authorities from different countries investigate the same cross-border partnerships, which are increasingly common in Europe.
Mr. Monti, however, expressed optimism that such difficulties could be overcome and efforts coordinated across borders.
For Mr. Monti, the vote was a sorely needed victory. Last month, he suffered a stinging defeat in a court in Luxembourg when it reversed the commission's decisions to block two European mergers. Next month, the union is expected to consider an overhaul of its merger laws.

Teaching Japan's Salarymen to Be Their Own Men

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
To listen to Masayoshi Toyoda, or any of his loosely associated band of activists, Japanese manhood has fallen on terrible times.
 Not so long ago it was acceptable, even cool, here to introduce oneself as an "average salaryman." The expression conjured images of the total company man -- someone who leaves work each day only to stay out late drinking and talking shop with colleagues, and whose first three words to his devoted wife upon arrival home were likely to be bath, meal, bed. As in, get them ready. 
 But those were the days of Japan's world-beating economy, when many women dreamed of nothing more than raising a family with a man with a lifetime job. During 12 years of flat growth, women have stampeded out of the kitchen and into the workplace. Now, as women have come to enjoy greater freedoms, there are suddenly few things less hip in Japan than to be an oyaji, or typical middle-aged man.
Like many social phenomena in Japan, the collapsing status of the corporate warrior has generated its own vocabulary. For younger women, the dark-suited company men seen everywhere walking two or three abreast, chain-smoking, their heads slightly bowed, are dasai (uncool) or nasakenai (clueless). For the wives to whom many of them return home in the evening, meanwhile, they are the nure-ochiba zoku (the wet leaf tribe) -- clingy, musty and emotionally spent. 
Mr. Toyoda, who has built a national network of men's liberation groups, is anything but nostalgic. What he yearns for is the reinvention of the Japanese man, not a return to the strong-and-silent types on whose backs Japan's fantastic post-World War II success supposedly was constructed. Indeed, rebellion against the old model is what turned him on to liberation in the first place.
A 36-year-old journalist, he grew up in awe of his father, who always seemed incredibly busy running a successful wholesale seafood business. But as he got older, Mr. Toyoda wondered why his dad was always exhausted, sullen or drunk in his rare moments of free time. 
Feeling suffocated by his father's emotional distance and depressed by the idea that he was expected to follow in his dad's footprints, Mr. Toyoda fled the family business for a spell of travel in the United States. While there he discovered feminism and reflected on the role of men in his own society.
"Eventually, I realized that the problems I was suffering didn't come from me, but rather from Japan's traditional patriarchy," he said. "Traditionally, Japanese men don't attach importance to their family life at all. I, for one, hardly ever had a proper conversation with my father."
Unlike their American counterparts, who often invoke religion or mythology, members of Japan's budding men's movement do not gather in the woods to beat drums or sit in circles to hug or cry. Neither Zeus nor Christ figures in their pantheon of gods and heroes.
What many of them do share with their Western counterparts is a feeling that men must find a way to be both vigorous and sensitive. This starts by rediscovering life outside the workplace, sharing time with their families and, above all, learning -- often for the first time -- how to communicate personal thoughts.
"Japanese men have lost their vigor, and are not lively any longer," said Yoshihiko Morotomi, a professor of psychology at Chiba University and author of "Desolate Man," a popular recent book. "Our self-esteem has traditionally come from relationships in which we are paid respect, either in the job or from the wife. But our society is going through a model change, and nowadays men don't have anywhere to turn for respect anymore."
For Mr. Toyoda, who formed the group Men's Lib Tokyo in 1995, and has since become well known by helping to start other chapters nationwide, the most basic function of male groups is to get men talking. He said he had learned how to do it himself almost by accident, when he attended a neighborhood seminar on gender equality years ago.
"Several men were discussing problems in their lives, from the challenges of being the eldest son to child-rearing, sexuality and so on," he said. "I discovered how to state my true feelings for the first time. Until then, I thought this was pathetic, but I found that it was not shameful at all."
Beyond encouraging communication, Mr. Toyoda wants to change the Japanese workplace. 
"My generation entered the workplace at the end of the bubble era, so many of my contemporaries are being hit by job cuts," he said. "My father's generation lived in a bullish era and enjoyed the fruits of their labors. Men stretch themselves today simply to avoid being sacked." 
One of Mr. Toyoda's priorities is lobbying companies and governments and sensitizing men about paternal leave. While almost all men are eligible, less than 1 percent of male employees presently use the benefit.
Men in their 20's are famously rebelling against the grim, anything-for-the-company sacrifices made by their fathers by dropping out of the job market, working a succession of part-time jobs and living off their parents for years after college. But the sweeping reappraisal of work has quietly made inroads among men in their 40's as well.
"I am not an ideal father or husband, but to me the most precious moments are the time I spend with my family, four of us, making fun of each other or watching TV and playing," said Shinichiro Yamamoto, 46, a friend of Mr. Toyoda's who works for a large auto manufacturer. "I have no special program or ideology. I just enjoy my life. I have to work five days a week, and do it simply because I need money."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Officials Are Trying to Raise a City in the Shadow of Detroit's Airport

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

DATELINE: ROMULUS, Mich., Nov. 21 

 BODY:
They had paid the consultant from North Carolina $60,000 to tell them how they could be like Amsterdam and Hong Kong and Dallas. They had spent millions of dollars acquiring land for the project.
 Now the officials from the area surrounding Detroit Metro Airport were listening to the consultant in a mansion built by Henry Ford in Dearborn, a few miles from here. On the wall hung a quotation from Ford: "Whatever is desirable and right is never impossible." 
 But just as this small city's mythical namesake took more than a day to build his metropolis, and just as he came to that task in part by the lack of an alternative, the planners of a 1,300-acre development intended as the cornerstone of a 25,000-acre stretch of commercial real estate between here and the dilapidated Willow Run cargo airport have much work to do, the speaker said. 
"It's going to change that Rust Belt image," John D. Kasarda, director of the Keenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said in his presentation. "An aerotropolis is going to form here. Is it going to be scattered, haphazard and in some cases unsightly? You can control that."
His renderings of what is to be called the Pinnacle Aeropark show its 1,300 acres developed with 2.9 million square feet of office space, 25 million square feet of laboratory and research buildings and 4.7 million square feet of high-technology warehouse space. It will be complemented by luxury hotels served by European-style circular intersections, a golf course, cycling trails, restaurants and shopping centers.
Today, though, Romulus is known as the doughnut city; the Detroit airport cuts a hole in the six-mile by six-mile geography -- and tax base -- of this city of 14,000. Surrounding the airport are fields of lettuce, cabbage, tomatoes, corn and bedding plants, crops that can be taken into Detroit and to farmers' markets. 
Speedy delivery of goods is also at the center of Mr. Kasarda's theory of what he calls the aerotropolis, a population and business center formed around an airport in the way that cities once formed around ports or crossroads.
Wayne County sought out Mr. Kasarda after its officials took on millions of dollars in debt in trying to expand the airport itself. Their hope is that he can help them build a tax-revenue machine to pay off the debt, and build it out of this vast and largely empty land.
In the United States, the best model is perhaps Alliance Texas, the 15,000-acre development 15 miles northwest of the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. It was begun in 1988 and is about 20 percent complete.
The developer of that project, Hillwood, recently announced that it would build 723,000 square feet of new speculative space to keep the project growing with a 5 percent to 7 percent vacancy rate.
Ross Perot Jr., chairman of Hillwood, said in a telephone interview that Alliance Texas was possible only because the need to build an airport coincided with regional economic desperation and raw land prices that had fallen to mid-1960's levels because of the savings and loan crisis.
And it would not have been possible, Mr. Perot said, if the area had not had as its elected representatives in the late 1980's both the speaker of the House of Representatives, Jim Wright, and the speaker of the Texas House, Gibson D. Lewis.
"It really was the planets aligned for one brief moment," he said.
In Romulus, 17 miles southwest of Detroit, Wayne County officials want to build the kind of new city that Mr. Kasarda has described. But they did not set down this path with that goal in mind.
Ten years ago, long before the state airport authority took over Detroit Metro, Wayne County started working on an expansion of the airport, adding two runways, a new terminal and access roads. The county spent $15.8 million in bond proceeds, with $12.6 million of that later reimbursed by the Federal Aviation Administration, to buy 400 acres around the expanded operations. 
Most of the homeowners agreed to sell at market rates, but the money could be spent only on houses and the land under them, not on farmland.
"We made a lot of people wealthy," said Dewitt J. Henry, director of the county Jobs and Economic Development Department. Still, he said, that it was a scattered site, and "you couldn't assemble enough land that was contiguous."
The F.A.A. required the county to set the newly acquired properties to commercial use, giving the communities a tax engine to replace the homes.
The county solicited bids from developers, rejecting proposals from national firms like Trammell Crow and Hillwood. It chose Heinz C. Prechter and Schostak Brothers, both local developers.
The two firms declined to work together on the project, leaving the county with land and no developer, and last year Mr. Prechter, the project's best advocate in the state capital and in Washington, died.
"Our process was backward," Mr. Henry said. "We should have had the land secured."
Having learned that lesson, Wayne County spent $50 million to acquire another 900 acres. By purchase and condemnation, the county has assembled a total of almost 1,300 contiguous acres.
The ground is mostly free of environmental concerns but lacks utilities or infrastructure. All told, the county spent about $66 million to acquire it.
The first phase of bringing roads, water systems and other utilities onto the property is expected to cost $60 million.
The State of Michigan, in exchange for an equity stake in the project, has allowed the county to defer future state tax revenues to help pay for the infrastructure, but not to repay the F.A.A.
To bring a development to fruition the county must work with Romulus and Huron Township. Both rely heavily on property taxes, both have jurisdiction over the zoning of parts of Pinnacle, and neither has identical ideas about the desirability of air cargo operations and warehouses.
While parts of the Detroit region have economic problems that would be an impediment to financing new development, the industrial market near the airport is one of the healthiest in the area.
Despite the addition of four million square feet of warehouse and manufacturing space in the last year, vacancy rates have fallen to 12.6 percent in the third quarter from 14.4 percent a year earlier, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Average annual asking rents for high-technology industrial space have risen to $11.21 a square foot from $10.62. Raw land costs $45,000 to $75,000 an acre, compared with triple that in the northern suburbs of Detroit, said Peter S. Rogers, a Cushman & Wakefield executive.
Mr. Kasarda, the consultant from North Carolina, wants Pinnacle to emulate Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, which is ringed by office buildings with tenants like Ernst & Young and Unilever and by retail stores that residents of the city visit on weekends. He said such buildings draw higher rental rates than do comparable buildings downtown.
The Pinnacle planners are taking encouragement from a decision by Visteon, a maker of automobile parts, to build a 220-acre research campus to the west of the airport, in the area they hope to develop after the Pinnacle Aeropark. Visteon is just the sort of supply-chain company that Mr. Kasarda suggested could drive growth near the airport.
The first challenge, though, is to find a master developer for Pinnacle.
"It's one thing to write 'office' on your master plan and another thing to get office tenants to look at it," said Steven D. Bradford, a principal of Trammell Crow who served as an expert witness for the county in condemnation proceedings.
Trammell Crow still hopes to win a share of the work on the project despite the earlier rejection. Mr. Bradford emphasized that only a national developer with deep experience in a variety of mixed-use projects could hope to take on a job of this scale, though none would have started such a project from scratch.
"No private company in their right mind would undertake it because it's a black hole," Mr. Bradford said. Wayne County, he added, "only did it out of necessity."

HEADLINE: After Setbacks, John Hancock Will Sell Boston Headquarters 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
John Hancock Financial Services, one of the country's largest life insurers, said yesterday that it was selling its landmark tower in Boston and two other headquarters buildings after suffering big investing losses.
 Analysts said the sale of the buildings, which John Hancock plans to continue to use under a leasing arrangement, would probably yield tidy profits that would help offset some of the $241 million in net investment losses that the company has reported so far this year. 
 David F. D'Alessandro, the chief executive of John Hancock, said that because prices for commercial real estate continued to be quite high, "this is an opportune time to proceed with a sale." 
The sale, he said, "will generate a significant amount of capital that can be redeployed in ways that will strengthen the company." He did not indicate how much the company hoped to raise.
David A. Havens, an analyst at UBS Warburg, said the sale would represent a double gain for John Hancock. Besides adding cash to its balance sheet, he said, the sale diminishes the company's real estate investments which are regarded less favorably by regulators and rating agencies.
Like many life insurance companies, John Hancock has seen its investment portfolio decline. The industry has also suffered billions of dollars in losses when companies like Enron, WorldCom and Global Crossing defaulted on bonds. At least some of John Hancock's losses involved bonds of Enron and WorldCom, according to Julie Burke, an analyst at Fitch Ratings. 
Moreover, John Hancock and many other life insurers have been forced to increase their reserves to cover potential losses related to the sale of variable annuities.
In September, John Hancock was among scores of life insurance companies whose financial strength ratings were lowered by Fitch Ratings. Some of the others were Metropolitan Life, Hartford Life and Guardian. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, the two largest rating agencies, have also lowered the ratings of John Hancock and some of the others.
Analysts and insurance executives say the industry is in its worst shape in a decade. But even so, they say, it is unlikely that any major life insurance company will fail. 
Vanessa Wilson, a Deutsche Bank analyst, said Hancock remains "one of the better capitalized companies in the insurance industry."
"They're just doing an astute thing here," she said. "The prices for trophy buildings have reached peak values and to keep so much cash and capital tied up in these big office buildings really doesn't make financial sense."
Michael Barry, another Fitch analyst, said Fitch knew John Hancock was planning to sell its headquarters when it lowered the company's ratings in September. The sale was factored in then, he said, and would not lead to an upgrade. 
While no other big insurers have announced plans to sell their headquarters, several others, including MetLife and Prudential have been paring their real estate portfolios. John Hancock pointed out that several competitors, including Lincoln National and MONY, formerly Mutual of New York, operate out of leased headquarters.
Thomas Moloney, John Hancock's chief financial officer, said among the possible uses for the sale proceeds would be the acquisition of other companies. But analysts were skeptical. "I think they are more focused right now on dealing with the challenging market conditions of the past year," Mr. Havens said.

Pentagon Wants $10 Billion a Year, Beyond Budget Growth, for Antiterror Fund

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER and RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
The Defense Department is seeking an extra $10 billion a year for the next five years, beyond the growth in its regular budget, to carry out its campaign against terrorism, senior Pentagon and other administration officials said today.
 Pentagon officials, who are putting the final touches on the request, are consulting with the White House on whether the annual $10 billion appropriation would be placed in a separate contingency fund, similar to one rejected by Congress this year, or would be written into the regular military budget. 
 Both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill proved unwilling this year to create a $10 billion fund for the Pentagon to spend with little Congressional oversight.
But with President Bush now in a more commanding position politically after the Republican victories in the midterm elections, administration officials seem increasingly confident not only of getting the money from Congress, but also of getting it on their terms: in a separate fund. 
The extra $10 billion a year could be used for military actions, for other emerging counterterrorism operations around the world and for the costs of added protection for military bases in the United States and overseas. None of it would go to the new Department of Homeland Security, or for increases requested by other departments and agencies, like the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., for their roles in counterterrorism.
The $10 billion would be insufficient to pay for a major war against a country like Iraq. The 1991 war in the Persian Gulf cost about $60 billion, most of which was paid by other allied nations.
The extra money is reflected in a budget request to the White House for 2004, along with a related five-year request, that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is expected to complete over the Thanksgiving holiday. Administration officials said the White House was expected to look positively on the $10 billion, given that Mr. Bush expressed disappointment this fall when Congress passed a military appropriations bill for the current fiscal year without including a war reserve fund of that amount.
Mr. Rumsfeld has not commented on Pentagon budget proposals, but in a meeting with foreign journalists today he emphasized that the United States and its allies needed to spend more on the military.
"We, as free people, must be willing to make the kinds of investments over a period of time that will enable our respective free countries to contribute to peace and stability, or we're making a terrible mistake," he said. "That is not directed at any one country. To the extent it's directed at all, it's directed to the United States of America. We need to do that."
The $10 billion would be in addition to budget growth that would cover inflation and whatever other increases for personnel, procurement, operations, maintenance, or research and development might be proposed by the president and approved by Congress.
"We are coming to a general agreement that our budget over the years would increase by inflation plus a $10 billion figure for the global war on terror," a senior Defense Department official said.
The request, if approved by the White House, would no doubt raise the same questions among members of Congress that this year's request did. With the power to wage war increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Congress has vigorously guarded its control over military expenditures, and this year's request by the Pentagon for $10 billion with no strings attached left members of both parties uneasy.
The Pentagon and the White House are still working out a framework for the $10 billion sum. It could again be proposed as a reserve fund, or it could be written into the budget as specific line items. 
On Oct. 23, in signing the $354.8 billion military appropriations bill for the current fiscal year, Mr. Bush lamented Congress's refusal to include a $10 billion war reserve fund.
"I am disappointed that the act does not fund the $10 billion I requested to support the war on terrorism," Mr. Bush said in a statement issued then.
Noting that the Pentagon had also gotten less than it had requested for operations and maintenance, he added, "Without these funds, we may be forced to reduce other important programs to finance the war on terrorism."
Even so, Mr. Bush has largely won Congressional approval for what he has called the largest military buildup in 20 years. And adding $10 billion a year to the regular budget for the next five years would amount to a further shift in priorities toward national security, and increase the pressure to cut spending on domestic programs.
Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a liberal-leaning policy research center, said proposals for a separate $10 billion counterterror reserve fund would not give the public or Congress sufficient oversight.
Quite apart from the costs of war in Afghanistan or any war in Iraq, Mr. O'Hanlon said, "nobody knows how to figure the eventual costs for things like base security, homeland defense, protecting key infrastructure, help to the National Guard and Reserve to prepare for catastrophic contingencies."
"So Rumsfeld is asking us to trust his first guess at what those costs are," Mr. O'Hanlon said. "To his credit, he is trying to isolate that piece. But there is not nearly enough information to give the Defense Department this much money almost into perpetuity."
The Pentagon's request highlights the difficulties faced by Mr. Bush and his budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., as they put together a plan for the 2004 federal budget at a time when the deficit is growing.
Mr. Bush has made clear that in setting budget priorities, he will put domestic and international security first. But some Democrats say he has shortchanged domestic security programs and underestimated the costs of getting the Department of Homeland Security fully operational.
At the same time, there is political pressure from both sides of the aisle to increase spending on education, to add prescription drug coverage for retirees and to finance other social programs. In addition, Mr. Bush has signaled that he intends to propose another round of tax cuts.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 
American Mediato Buy Weider for $350 Million

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
In an effort to broaden its business beyond the tabloid world, American Media, the owner of The National Enquirer and The Star, is expected to announce today the purchase of the muscle-and-fitness magazines of Weider Publications for $350 million. 
 The effort to buy the magazines was led by David Pecker, American Media's chief executive and part-owner who is known for his grand pronouncements and competitive fire. His characterization of the deal, which does not include Weider's vitamins and nutrition business, will do nothing to erode that reputation. 
 "With this purchase, we will go from $375 million in revenues to $550 million and we want to be over a billion in the next five years," Mr. Pecker said. "We have a tabloid division and now have a consumer magazine division, with Weider as its crown jewel, combined with our own distribution system. This is a transforming event." 
The sale of the company, which has 400 employees and seven magazines including Muscle & Fitness, Shape and Men's Fitness, is the largest transaction in what has been a slow year for magazine mergers and acquisitions. Industry executives suggested that the Weider publications were fetching such a high price because of the dearth of available magazines and an excess of buyers, particularly private equity firms.
"We all wanted it, but Pecker wanted it worse," one competing bidder said.
The price will be dear. This year Weider magazines will have estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $27.5 million, according to Mr. Pecker. That means American Media, which is principally owned by Evercore Partners, will be paying a multiple of almost 13 times earnings. In the last year, according to industry analysts, multiples of 10 times earnings have been more common.
"It is a pretty robust price in this environment," said David Allen, a media analyst at Morgan Stanley. "I think it is a sign that people still see value in the publishing space."
Austin M. Beutner, president of Evercore Partners, said that the $60 million in taxation benefits that the acquisition will provide means the firm is paying a net price of $290 million. 
The successful acquisition of the Weider magazines comes after several misfires by American Media. It lost out on EMAP's United States magazines to Primedia and the Times Mirror magazines to Time Inc. 
"We are pretty cautious people," Mr. Beutner said. "We don't think that the past few years, with the frothy ad sales and economy, has not been a great environment for buyers. We decided to keep our powder dry, and things have changed to the point where we feel that Weider is a terrific buy for us at this price." 
And Mr. Beutner said that the company was not finished shopping.
Mr. Pecker has been a busy man since he left Hachette Filipacchi magazines in 1999. Evercore Partners, a private group that includes Roger C. Altman, the former deputy Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, backed Mr. Pecker in the purchase of American Media for $835 million. Before the year was out, the partnership added Globe Communications, publishers of The Globe, The National Examiner, and The Sun, for $105 million.
But Mr. Pecker's dominance of the tabloid magazine rack has not been as lucrative as he might have hoped. As mainstream media have become increasingly willing to compete for salacious stories, once the purview of publications like The National Enquirer, the tabloids have continued to suffer circulation declines on the newsstand.
Single-copy sales of the three top tabloids have dropped by more than half in the last 10 years, and the National Enquirer lost 11 percent of newsstand sales in the six months ended in June of this year, compared with the period a year ago. 
Rising advertising revenues and higher prices for the publications have helped keep revenues and earnings stable. Total company revenue was $181 million in the two fiscal quarters ended Sept. 23, compared with $186.3 million for the period a year earlier. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were about $66 million in both periods.
The anthrax incident at the company's headquarters in Boca Raton, Fla., last year caused enormous dislocation and what Mr. Pecker estimated as $10 million in out-of-pocket costs. 
The Weider purchase also reduces the company's dependence on circulation, which still accounts for 88 percent of total revenue, according to Mr. Pecker. American Media is expected to try to sell ad packages across the company's various publications.
Other publishing companies chose not to bid for Weider in part because the ads for dietary supplements and muscle-building products would not mesh with ad packages for their existing titles. A reminder of the risks associated with those ads came in the middle of the bidding, when the Federal Trade Commission announced that it would be giving increased scrutiny to advertising for products that make weight-loss claims.
"We looked at the regulation issue pretty aggressively and were not concerned that it is going to be a significant problem," Mr. Pecker said.
Mr. Pecker generally embraces controversy. He has a reputation as a bit of cowboy in the relatively well-mannered culture of publishing. When he was the chief of Hachette, he often skirmished with the Magazine Publishers of America and eventually quit the group. He could also be dismissive about the separation between the business and editorial sides at magazines. In 1996, he killed a negative article about Planet Hollywood in Premiere magazine at the request of Ronald O. Perelman, then half-owner of the magazine. After two editors at the magazine quit, Mr. Pecker was quoted as saying, "The last time I looked, I am the C.E.O. of the company." 
He is fond of grand pronouncements, having suggested when he was at Hachette that it would have major businesses in CD-ROM's and cable shows, plans that never panned out. And his diversification efforts at American Media have met with mixed success. A biweekly automobile publication, Auto World Magazine, has been scaled back to monthly, and Mira, a Spanish-language publication that he claimed would dominate the Hispanic market, has yet to gain significant traction.
Mr. Pecker is known throughout the industry as a shrewd financial operator who can hack his way to the bottom line, often through cost cuts.
"I think he is a terrific executive who helped build Hachette into what it is today," said Jack Kliger, who replaced Mr. Pecker as chief of Hachette Filipacchi Media. "He has tremendous financial acumen."
And executives close to Weider say they believe that there is opportunity for growth.
"This is a good company that is semi-recession-proof," said Michael Carr, former president of Weider and Playboy. "These are magazines which are about health and fitness that have had very consistent growth over the past decade and a half. I don't think they have topped out yet."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 28, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the purchase of Weider Publications by American Media for $350 million misstated the deal's ranking in magazine publishing this year. It is the second largest. Reiman Publications was purchased by the Reader's Digest Association in March for $760 million.

HEADLINE: 3rd-Quarter Growth Revised Upward, to 4% 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
The economy grew more briskly in the third quarter than first thought, with car sales helping to more than triple the second-quarter pace, the Commerce Department reported today.
 Other reports, however, sent crossed signals. One showed consumer sentiment posting a smaller-than-expected rise this month after the nine-year low set in October. New-home sales in October, however, remained strong, falling moderately from September's record level. 
 The Commerce Department said that gross domestic product rose at a revised 4 percent annual rate in the period ended in September after a 1.3 percent gain in the previous quarter. The agency had originally estimated that the economy grew 3.1 percent in the third quarter.
A buildup of business inventories helped account for the upward revision, but there was a fall in corporate spending, which was originally reported as rising a bit.
Businesses increased inventories by $15.5 billion in the third quarter after a rise of $4.9 billion in the second. Business spending on facilities and equipment dropped 0.7 percent -- the eighth consecutive quarterly decline -- as the revisions erased a previously reported gain. Within that category, spending on equipment and software increased.
Consumer spending rose 4.1 percent after an 1.8 percent gain in the second quarter and accounted for most of the quarter-to-quarter improvement. A sharp gain in auto sales played a big role.
While growth in the third quarter was strong, several signs, including weakness in manufacturing and a slide in car sales, have suggested that the economy began to brake sharply as the quarter ended. 
The Conference Board, a private research organization, reported today that its consumer confidence index rebounded in November, but the rise to 84.1, from 79.6 in October, was smaller than expected. The index remained well below September's reading of 93.7.
Most of the index's gain came from optimism on the economy's six-month outlook.
"The rebound in expectations suggests consumers do not expect economic conditions to become worse," said Lynn Franco, director of the board's research center. She said the report signaled "brighter holiday spending than was anticipated only a month ago."
But the report was not without dark spots. Over 27 percent of those surveyed said jobs were hard to get, the largest proportion in more than eight years.
In a third report, the Commerce Department said that sales of new single-family homes in October slipped from September's record pace, dropping 4.5 percent, to an annual rate of 1.007 million units. Despite the slide, it was still the third best monthly sales rate on record.
The decline in new-home sales in October was centered in the Northeast and Midwest. Sales in the Northeast slid by 32.3 percent, to a 65,000 annual rate from a pace of 96,000 in September. Sales of new homes in the Midwest dropped 17.1 percent, to a 165,000 annual rate.
In the South, the largest market for new homes, sales increased 1.2 percent, to a 489,000 rate. Sales also gained in the Western region, rising 4.3 percent to a 288,000 annual rate.

PERSON: Omar Wasow 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Entrepreneur Takes Black-Oriented Site Out of Red

BYLINE:  By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
A FRIEND recently marveled to Omar Wasow, executive director of BlackPlanet.com, that it is amazing to visit a dot-com where people still have jobs. You are struck by this, too, as Mr. Wasow, who is lanky with dreadlocks draped in a long ponytail, gives a tour of the youthful Flatiron District offices on a late afternoon.
 Mr. Wasow, 31, is explaining why BlackPlanet.com is, by far, the most heavily trafficked African-American Web destination, with 1.5 million different visitors in any given month, according to the Nielsen/NetRatings service. 
 He is studied and polite, not the sort to sling a raspberry at industry skeptics who more than a year ago dismissed BlackPlanet as too racially specific and doomed to fail.
"People didn't believe there was a business to be had serving African-Americans online," he says. "And to the extent that business was there, they were convinced 'Why would a start-up succeed when you've got all these big media companies doing the same thing?' "
BlackPlanet, which is privately held and began in September 1999, just recorded its first quarterly profit, Mr. Wasow says, though he won't reveal how much. "If we ate a couple of sandwiches, we would have been in the red," he says. "It's not a major milestone, but for an Internet company, it's a big deal."
So what accounts for BlackPlanet's popularity?
"What we've done is taken the grapevine in the black community and extended it to the Internet," he says, loping down the spiral staircase that joins the two floors of Community Connect Inc. of New York, which builds Web sites intended for minority groups, including Black Planet.com. AsianAvenue.com and MiGente.com are there, too.
Mr. Wasow, a Stanford graduate, is wearing a hand-tailored blue suit and an apricot-colored shirt. He has model good looks. He was named the sexiest Internet executive by People magazine in 2000. He is Oprah Winfrey's on-air technology expert and the Internet analyst for WNBC-TV, a job he held at cable television's MSNBC for five years.
He's clearly at ease as he sits at a conference table in a quiet corner. He says his own office is no man's land, a temporary storage closet for the 85-employee Community Connect, where he is also a senior manager.
He enthusiastically points out the features of BlackPlanet.com: the message boards, chat rooms, personal Web pages and, more recently, a chance to find romance and jobs. The home page constantly tells visitors how many have logged on to the site.
"The essence of it is the social aspect," he says. "What it means is that this site is alive. There's hustle and bustle. There are living and breathing people at the site. Most of the other sites feel like being alone in the library. We've built ourselves from the ground up to be much more like a cafe than a library. We focus on the conversation."
Mr. Wasow is known as a digital-age intellectual, also hip and unconventional. A founder of a charter elementary school in Bedford-Stuyvesant set to open next fall, he jokes that the independent public school is penitence for being a capitalist in a family of educators.
His voice grows serious, though, when he talks about how basic literacy must precede computer literacy. "The real way to help poor kids succeed in the information economy is to teach them to process information in their own heads effectively, not use word processors and spreadsheets," he says.
Mr. Wasow's background is middle-class and biracial. His father, an economics professor, is Jewish, and his mother, an early-childhood educator, is African-American. He grew up mostly in Greenwich Village, and went online at age 12.
He had tried a similar Web site in 1993, financed through credit cards and savings and operated from the living room of his Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, apartment. He says too few black Internet users existed then to support it. But in the last five years, he says, blacks have embraced the Internet at a faster rate than whites.
"There are some folks who don't appreciate why a black online community would be valuable," he says. "Some of these people understand the idea of a Jewish community or a Christian community but the idea of a racially defined community is somehow inconsistent with the values of integration, that somehow race shouldn't matter.
"But the reality is that, whether you're talking about the practical ways race affects people's lives, from trying to get a mortgage or buying a car, to the social aspect, people want to hang out with people who have had shared experiences."
AT times, Mr. Wasow folds his arms tightly as he ponders a thought. When the conversation ends, he wonders whether he sounds too serious. He wants you to know he can be fun, even silly. He wore a red velvet suit to the party introducing the Web site, looking like a cross between Santa Claus and James Brown.
He still sees himself as a bit of a nerd. He says his girlfriend of a year, a computer programmer, is fairly nerdy, too. (She'll love that.)
As if to prove his nerd cred, he swings over to a computer to call up the "Archie McPhee Nerd Test." He got a 98 percent rating, because, among other things, he has his own Web site and domain name, checks his e-mail before brushing his teeth, wears a digital watch. He's been to parties where most of the guests were math Ph.D.'s. (His grandfather, whose adoptive Bulgarian name was Wasow, was a math Ph.D.)
So do we have him pegged? Not exactly. "There's nothing mutually exclusive about being a gadget freak, a policy wonk and a clothes horse. For me, it's perfectly typical."

Mets Offer Ticket Prices To Suit Every Occasion

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Are all baseball teams created equal? Hardly. There are high-revenue and small-market teams, teams with superstars and teams with little identity. There are Yankees and Royals, BMW's and Hyundais.
 If a 56-victory team from 2002 plays the Mets during the middle of the week next June, it is not as alluring as a 101-victory playoff club in for a weekend series. 
 That is the philosophy behind a four-tier ticket plan introduced by the Mets yesterday that raises prices the most for games against key opponents, usually on weekends, and lowers them against less successful teams on weeknights.
But there are nuances: a great team like the Atlanta Braves will cost more to watch on weekends than on weeknights, and a middling team like the Philadelphia Phillies has become a utilityman of sorts, the Cesar Tovar of the schedule, moving through three ticket tiers depending on the date.
"We decided that the three principal factors that determine why a fan goes to a game are time of year, day of week and the opponent," said David Howard, the Mets' senior vice president for business. "In the summer months, attendance rises with school out, then we see a difference in attendance for weekends than midweek, and there's a different demand for Yankees series than any other."
The Mets' new plan could blunt the kind of criticism that usually greets increases in ticket prices for losing ball clubs because it preserves last season's ticket prices for 27 games and cuts the prices for 16 others.
"The more we studied it, the more it made sense to tailor pricing to match demand as much as possible," Howard said.
Under the plan, four categories of tickets are established.
*The Gold Plan covers 17 dates, including opening day against the Chicago Cubs; weekend series against Atlanta, Seattle, the Yankees and St. Louis; and a midweek series against San Francisco and Barry Bonds. The peak ticket price of $53, for inner-field boxes, is $10 more than it was last season. The cheap seats rise to $16 from $12.
*The 21-game Silver Plan includes weekend series against Arizona, Philadelphia, Cincinnati and Colorado, and two midweek series against Atlanta. The top price rises $5 to $48, and the lowest price goes up $2 to $14.
*The Bronze Plan, for 27 dates, preserves the most expensive seat at $43 and the cheapest one at $12, for midweek games against Chicago, Los Angeles, Florida, Montreal and Milwaukee, and weekend games against Montreal and San Diego.
*The Value Plan, for 16 games, discounts the top seat to $38, and the least expensive one to $8, for midweek series against Houston, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Florida and Pittsburgh.
Fitting each series into the categories was handled by the Mets' ticket department, with Howard's input. "There wasn't a lot of debate," he said. "A few series could have gone either way. But mainly it broke out cleanly."
By moving to variable pricing, the Mets are following the lead of the Cubs, Colorado, Cleveland and San Francisco.
Howard said the Mets hiked the average ticket price by 4 percent, and, if attendance equals last season's 2.8 million -- wishful thinking, perhaps, for a 75-86 club -- revenues should increase by a similar amount. 
"I think it's the wave of the future because it makes economic sense," Dan Migala, executive editor of Team Marketing Report, said of the Mets' strategy. "It maximizes revenues yet it doesn't alienate fans who don't have a huge wallet to draw upon. In years past, you saw price increases running across the board, but now there's a lot more sophistication."
He said variable pricing was being tinkered with in the N.H.L. but is unlikely to be adopted by the N.F.L. or the N.B.A.
Within baseball, variable pricing is executed in different ways. The Giants add $1 to $5 to the cost of ticket prices for games played on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. The Cardinals add $1 to ticket prices for all games from May 31 to Sept. 7.
In a more elaborate way, the Cubs announced a three-level season ticket plan last week. Eight value dates for afternoon games from April 9 to May 7 are the cheapest (the best club box is $18). Nineteen prime games -- for opening day and all Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from June 6 to Aug. 17 -- are the most expensive (the club box is $45). And for the remaining 54 dates, fans will pay $36 for the club box.
The Yankees brought flexibility to their ticket pricing for 2003. While adding $2 to $10 to the cost of ticket prices (the most expensive seat will now be $72), they also designated eight games in which 24,616 seats in the upper deck would be sold for $5 each. 
In the type of front-office handicapping behind the Mets' variable-pricing plan, the Mets are risking that a "gold" team like the Giants will falter and be overpriced, or that a value-plan club like the Brewers will rise out of 56-106 ignominy.
Howard said the Mets would not raise, or lower, the price of unsold tickets depending on the fortunes of teams as the 2003 season proceeds.
The Mets also risk that opponents finding themselves in the bronze and value categories will post the discount prices for their games on a clubhouse bulletin board and hope it will create a room full of angry players who don't like to be relegated to Filene's Basement.
General Manager Dave Littlefield of the Pirates, a team Mets fans will be able to see for bargain prices, said: "I don't worry about those types of things. We have to spend our energies improving our club. Whatever games they choose for discounting is their decision."

HEADLINE: Identity-Theft Case Exposes Threat of Rogue Insiders 

BYLINE:  By BENJAMIN WEISER and JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
The false credit card charges, on accounts opened as far away as Texas, had totaled $80,000, and the calls from creditors had grown so insistent that Ronald Quitne and his partner, Jim Brohan, used the answering machine in their Florida home to screen all calls.
 "If it wasn't a friend or someone we wanted to speak with, we didn't take the calls at all," Mr. Brohan said. "You're a captive in your own home." 
 Mr. Quitne and Mr. Brohan were actually just two victims of what federal prosecutors said this week was the largest identity theft crime in the country's history. 
The theft scheme, which was run by a former help desk employee at a Long Island software company and which expanded to include a ring of Nigerians in the Bronx who bought many people's stolen personal information, ultimately wound up harming 30,000 people, according to federal prosecutors in Manhattan.
People's credit ratings were ruined, their bank accounts were sometimes drained and their names were being used by strangers across the country.
Mr. Brohan said the arrests were probably "just the tip of the iceberg" in figuring out the dimensions of the thefts. And he said that there was still months of work ahead to restore order to his household's finances. Mr. Quitne died over the summer.
"Somebody tells you that you have to hire an attorney, pay for that, and then after two years you might get clean," Mr. Brohan said.
The tales of victims from the three-year criminal enterprise, prosecutors and federal regulators say, are nearly endless, and officials at the Federal Trade Commission said yesterday that they had been flooded with calls from people concerned that they had been harmed in other similar schemes.
Many law enforcement and security experts say the case announced this week simply provides a startlingly large window onto a problem that not only threatens people's sense of privacy and invulnerability, but also poses questions about the priority many companies place on security.
Officials said there was no evidence of a terrorist connection to the fraud. But the case raises the specter of terrorists' gaining what appears to have been cheap and easy access to material that can be used to create false identities within the United States, experts said.
Joanna P. Crane, the manager of the trade commission's identity theft program, which was created in January 1999, said that the entire episode was troubling because what was stolen was exactly the material that terrorists would aim to gather.
The case, many security experts say, also shows what they have long contended: that insiders are a bigger threat than outside hackers, because they have access to closely held passwords, and knowledge of the systems they are seeking to manipulate.
"All the energy has gone to putting in stuff to keep out those pimply faced 14-year-olds," said John Pescatore, a security expert with Gartner Inc. "And then we start laying off all of the employees with the economic slump, and we forget about making sure we protected our information from those people who are really annoyed with us."
Indeed, the ring revealed this week, prosecutors said, began only in early 2000 after one of the defendants, a New Rochelle man named Linus Baptiste, was able to reach an insider at Teledata Communications Inc., Philip Cummings. Mr. Cummings was told that there were people on the street who would pay up to $60 per name, and that the two could split the money between them.
"Without him," a federal prosecutor, Katherine M. Choo, said of Mr. Cummings in a bail hearing on Monday, "the crime would never have occurred."
The federal authorities, though, now have an insider, too: Mr. Baptiste has agreed to plead guilty, a federal criminal complaint says, and is cooperating with the authorities, James B. Comey, the United States attorney in Manhattan, confirmed yesterday. He refused to elaborate.
Mr. Comey said on Monday that as the federal investigation continues, it is seeking to identify who among the 30,000 victims actually suffered financial losses, and how much money was lost. Mr. Comey said that known losses total more than $2.7 million, but are expected to grow as more claims are investigated. His office is writing to all 30,000 victims, seeking information and offering assistance.
The inquiry is also focusing on what prosecutors have said was a ring of Nigerians in the Bronx and Brooklyn, who supplied Mr. Baptiste and Mr. Cummings with names and stolen Social Security numbers, and paid thousands of dollars to buy each person's credit history.
Many of the victims whose credit histories were obtained, and who reported that people were tapping into their bank accounts and credit lines, told of fraud that was tracked to the Bronx. For example, an address of a victim who could live anywhere in the United States might have been changed to a Bronx address, where bank statements would be directed, one of the first steps in an identity theft, officials said. 
Apart from noting their background in court papers, the government has offered no detail about the Nigerians, such as their identities or immigration status, but are seeking to determine where the data obtained by the ring ultimately went, and how it was used.
As the case shows, the easy access afforded by a computer to vast databases suggests that identity theft could be carried out by someone with a laptop overseas.
"It reminds us," Mr. Comey said yesterday, "why we have been so vigilant in the area of identity fraud since Sept. 11, because as big a problem as identity takeover for financial gain may be, our greatest fears involve identity takeover with the aim of committing horrific acts of violence."
By the government's account, the fraud scheme revealed this week lasted almost three years, although it was not until eight months ago that it was first detected. Ms. Crane, the manager of the trade commission's identity theft program, said in an interview that the case raised questions about the practices of Teledata, the Bay Shore, N.Y., company where Mr. Cummings, 33, worked from mid-1999 to March 2000.
"His supervisors should have presumably been watching his activities more closely," she said. "There should have been an audit trail on his activities." Suggesting that the fraud might have been detected earlier, she added, "They need to make sure that whatever enabled him to have access is retrieved."
Prosecutors have said that while Mr. Cummings was working at Teledata's help desk and assisting clients, he learned their private passwords and codes, which were used in the scheme.
Teledata, which provides software for banks and other companies to obtain credit histories from the nation's three largest credit bureaus, has said it has fully cooperated with the authorities, and officials have depicted it as a victim as well. A company spokeswoman said last night that she would not comment further.
Credit reporting and credit issuing companies have, historically, not paid the kind of exacting attention to security that major banks have, in no small part because banks are highly regulated and have to meet security requirements, Mr. Pescatore, the security expert, said. "These companies in the peripheral realms of the financial industries don't have the systems in place to manage access," he said.
Computer security experts say the case offers at least one major lesson -- that companies must cut off access for former employees. "When an employee has a certain level of sensitivity and leaves the organization," said Doug Barbin, a principal consultant for Guardent Inc., a security services company based in Waltham, Mass., "we recommend they do a global sweep to make sure that major points of entry and passwords have been changed."
The case also shows how easy it has become for private information to be found and exploited, said Benjamin Berry, a white-collar crime supervisor in the F.B.I.'s New York office.
"The problem is that the Social Security number is just used so frequently during the course of one's daily living that it becomes too readily available," he said.

HEADLINE: Support for Feeding Programs Trails Rising Need, Survey Says 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
With a sharp increase in hungry immigrants and the unemployed but little increase in support, the city's soup kitchens and food pantries will turn away hundreds of thousands of people this year, a survey released yesterday said.
 Figures released by the city, however, indicated a different situation. 
 The New York City Coalition Against Hunger said the 248 agencies that answered its annual survey of food providers reported feeding an average of 27 percent more people in 2002 than they fed last year. Seventy-three percent of the agencies that responded said they were feeding more children this year than they fed last year. 
While financing for such agencies had generally remained stable or increased, the coalition said, it was not nearly enough to match the rise in demand for their services. The agencies estimated they would turn away, in all, 349,776 needy New Yorkers this year. Many agencies receive money through the city government, and they could be hurt by deep city budget cuts.
"The bottom line is that the agencies have had increasing demand and only marginal increases in food and funds," said Joel Berg, executive director of the coalition. "They were overburdened before Sept. 11, and now they are absolutely overwhelmed. The only entity with resources big enough to solve this problem is government."
The agencies speculated that the top reasons for the growing demand were continued economic fallout from the Sept. 11 attack and rising unemployment. Immigrant families, who do not qualify for many public assistance programs, have been particularly vulnerable to the economic slowdown, the agencies reported. They also reported that a third of the families they served had one member working and still could not make ends meet.
The coalition and the city's public advocate, Betsy Gotbaum, said the city was responsible for some of the increased demand at food kitchens.
"New York is falling behind in enabling eligible families to obtain federal food stamp benefits," Ms. Gotbaum said in a written statement. The use of food stamps peaked in New York in 1996 at about one and a half million and declined to fewer than 800,000 at the beginning of this year. Advocates for the poor say the city discourages those who leave welfare but are still eligible for food stamps from claiming their benefits.
Statistics compiled by the city, however, did not corroborate the coalition's numbers. The Human Resources Administration says the 416 food pantries that receive agency money reported feeding on average fewer people this year than in 2000 or 2001. The average number of monthly visits to food pantries was 492,000 in the first six months of this year, close to number for the same period in 2000; 2001 had a substantially higher monthly average, which was attributed to the Sept. 11 attack.
The city also says changes in federal law making more legal immigrants eligible for benefits have increased the number of people receiving food stamps by 4.7 percent since January. The number receiving food stamps but not welfare payments has increased 23 percent since the beginning of the year, the city says.
"There have been improvements," Mr. Berg, of the coalition, conceded, "but the fact is the gains have not come close to making up for the loss in the rolls that we have experienced since 1997."

PERSON: Joseph E. Slater 

HEADLINE: J. E. Slater, 80, U.S. Aide in Postwar Germany 

BYLINE:  By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Joseph E. Slater, who worked on the "de-Nazification" of Germany after World War II and was instrumental in making the Aspen Institute an important East-West conduit in the cold war, died on Tuesday at his home in Southampton, N.Y. He was 80.
 The cause was Parkinson's disease, his daughter, Sandra Marian Slater, said. 
 From 1944 to 1954, Mr. Slater had a number of crucial posts in Europe and Washington as postwar European alliances emerged and as Germany became a modern democracy. As hostilities drew to a close, he helped work on the Four Power Allied Control Council, which controlled Germany after its defeat. 
Mr. Slater was deputy United States secretary to the council until 1948, when he moved to the policy planning staff at the State Department to help form the United Nations.
When John J. McCloy was named United States high commissioner for Germany in 1949, Mr. Slater returned with him as secretary general of the Allied High Commission. In 1952, Mr. Slater moved to Paris, where he was executive secretary in the office of the United States representatives to NATO and the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, set up under the Marshall Plan.
Mr. Slater's work on postwar German reconstruction and at Aspen was the subject of two academic studies, "America and the Intellectual Cold War in Europe" by a Columbia University historian, Volker R. Berghahn, which appeared last year, and "The Aspen Idea" by Sidney Hyman, published in 1976.
Mr. Slater became president and chief executive of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies in 1969, after working as chief economist for an oil company, running the international affairs program of the Ford Foundation, working as deputy assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs under President John F. Kennedy and heading the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.
Under his direction, the Aspen Institute, which had been a comparatively small organization that specialized in educational seminars for executives, increased its range and scale, becoming a well-known meeting place for world leaders, scholars and scientists on international issues.
The institute worked closely with the United Nations and played an important role in mobilizing world opinion on environmental questions.
In 1973, Mr. Slater won German backing to open a branch in Berlin. It quickly became a center for informal contacts between officials and others from both sides of the Iron Curtain.
Mr. Slater also established branches in France, Italy, Japan and South Korea.
Surviving are his wife, the former Annelore Kremser, and his daughter, Sandra, of Palo Alto, Calif.

HEADLINE: Israel Asks U.S. For an Increase Of $4 Billion In Military Aid 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
Israel is asking the Bush administration for about $4 billion in new military aid and $8 billion to $10 billion in loan guarantees to bolster its economy, a government official said today.
 Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's chief of staff, Dov Weisglass, and the director general of Israel's finance ministry, Ohad Marani, made the request at a meeting on Monday with Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's national security adviser. 
 The Israeli Embassy declined to disclose how much help was requested, but said the Israelis were promised a prompt reply. An administration official provided the figures. 
Mr. Marani presented an account of the economic situation in Israel, and he and Mr. Weisglass had a detailed discussion with Ms. Rice, the embassy said in a statement.
A 26-month conflict with the Palestinians has strained Israel's defense budget, while the violence has sharply reduced foreign investment and tourism.
Israel is the largest recipient of United States loans and grants, amounting to $2.9 billion this fiscal year.
The State Department said last week it would ask Congress for $2.16 billion in military aid for Israel for fiscal year 2004, which begins next September. That is an increase of $120 million from a request for $2.04 billion for this year.
Israel relies on loan guarantees to borrow at lower interest rates. There is no cost to the United States if the loans are repaid, and Israel never has defaulted on a loan.
Israel's role, if any, in a United States war with Iraq is not clear.
Mr. Sharon has said Israel reserves the right to respond if attacked. In the Persian Gulf war, in 1991, while under Iraqi missile fire, Israel complied with United States requests and did not respond.
In any event, preparations for a possible war are contributing to Israel's military expenses.

HEADLINE: Mexico Leader Presses U.S. To Resolve Migrants' Issues 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
At the start of meetings between high-level officials from Mexico and the United States, President Vicente Fox issued a public challenge to the Bush administration today, saying it was crucial that negotiations resume on broad immigration reforms that were derailed by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
 Among the proposals are measures that would give legal status to 3.5 million Mexicans in the United States and expand guest-worker programs for Mexicans. 
 "Now is the moment to restart our negotiations with renewed energy to achieve an integral agreement," President Fox said.
American officials responded with reservations and pleas for patience. 
"These things will take time," said Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who led the American delegation. "They are not simple issues; they are difficult issues. If we could both snap our fingers and make all the problems go away, we would do so this moment."
President Bush, addressing the gathering in a videotaped message, made no specific commitment, but said his government would continue to work with Mexican officials "on creative new policies so that immigration is legal, orderly and safe."
It has been almost two years since President Fox first pressed the United States to adopt an ambitious package of reforms aimed at opening the border to a freer flow of workers. 
President Bush, declaring Mexico one of the United States' most important partners and praising Mexican immigrants for their contributions to both countries' economies, committed to high-level negotiations on Mr. Fox's proposals, raising expectations on both sides for progress on an issue that had roiled relations for decades.
But support in the United States diminished dramatically after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and the Bush administration set aside the immigration talks to focus on national security and fighting terrorism.
As Mexico waited months for the United States to restart the talks, relations between President Fox and President Bush began to show signs of strain, and the political costs at home for President Fox began to mount. In his comments today, he acknowledged the increased security concerns in the United States.
Still, he urged American officials to establish "a framework that clearly distinguishes between those people who arrive in the United States to work and enrich the economy with their labor from those who could represent a threat to the security of the United States and our region." 
Secretary Powell pointed out that a new "political situation" in the United States, generated by Congressional elections and the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security, was likely to delay the administration's work on immigration issues further.
But Secretary Powell sought to reassure Mexico that it had not fallen off the United States' agenda. He said State Department officials would begin work on identifying "items that we can pursue over the next six months to a year."
"There should be no doubt in anyone's mind that this is a priority for President Bush, just as it is a priority for President Fox," he said. "We remain committed to doing everything we can to move forward. But we have to be realistic about the changes that have occurred over the last 14 months." 
Doubts in Mexico, however, run deep. One official in the Foreign Ministry said it was clear that the United States "still has cold political feet on the immigration issue."
The talks today came as the United States begins negotiating with Mexico over plans for a military strike against Iraq. 
Mexico, which holds a seat on the United Nations Security Council, had joined with France in expressing reservations about the use of immediate and unilateral force to disarm Iraq. After seven weeks of negotiations, Mexico joined with other Council members to vote in favor of a United States resolution.
Mexico has traditionally opposed the use of military force by the United States. A senior aide to Mexico's foreign minister, Jorge Castaneda, said he expected the next round of negotiations to be even more politically difficult for President Fox than the last.
At a news conference at the end of the meeting, Secretary Powell said the United States and Mexico had "reaffirmed our joint determination to see Saddam Hussein disarm, now, fully and finally."

HEADLINE: New York City Is Seeking State's Help on Medicaid 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration, facing a $4 billion Medicaid bill that is set to escalate over the next several years, plans to ask Albany next month to eliminate some of the city's burden. Among the things city officials are pondering are reduced services for Medicaid recipients and permission to toughen eligibility requirements.
 Further, officials in the administration will soon be approaching county leaders throughout the state -- whose own balance sheets are teetering under huge Medicaid bills -- in hopes that a united front of localities can persuade the state government to rein in these costs. 
 New York State has greatly expanded its Medicaid program in recent years. While the federal government picks up 50 percent of New York's Medicaid costs -- far less than it pays many other states -- New York's program is among the most generous in the country, and 25 percent of the overall tab is picked up by local governments like New York City. 
"This is a program that rises every year," said William T. Cunningham, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's communications director. "And the nature of the program is that we don't control it. Given the size of the problem we have now, this will be a significant issue this year." 
Across the nation, governors are bemoaning the rising costs of Medicaid coverage. Medicaid costs usually rise in recessions, but this time, states have also had to absorb increased costs in health care generally, as well as the added burden of new Medicaid programs that Washington has imposed in recent years. 
In 2002, states' Medicaid spending grew roughly 13 percent, roughly double the rate in 1995; Medicaid costs make up about 20 percent of each state's spending, according to the National Governors Association.
But counties in New York are in an unusually difficult situation, because the state requires them to pick up 25 percent of their total Medicaid bills. Only a handful of other states pass on any significant Medicaid costs to localities. And of the $4.3 billion paid by counties in New York State, $3 billion is paid by New York City.
Each spring, as sure as the daffodils rise, New York City goes to Albany, begging the state government to pick up its 25 percent share. (Localities do not pay for the long-term care Medicaid costs or for a special program for poor children.) 
Such requests go unheeded, and stand little chance this year as the state faces its own fiscal problems. A spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki said it was too early in the budget process to comment on what the state might do.
But New York City officials and other county leaders are hoping that the state will at least consider other ways of relieving their pain. City officials are studying what the Giuliani administration did with its welfare benefits, to see if similar methods, like tightening eligibility requirements or toughening enforcement of existing ones, could be applied to Medicaid. 
Further, the city and other localities may ask the state to reduce payments to medical care providers or reduce some services offered under Medicaid, or at least to not add any, as the state has done numerous times in recent years. 
The New York State Association of Counties is asking the state government to cap the amount currently paid by counties, so that if the state expands its menu of benefits, it will pick up the added costs with the federal government alone. 
Unlike New York City, most counties in the state pay for their Medicaid costs through sales and property taxes, and in many counties, property tax increases have been significant. Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive, said this month that his county's budget would grow 6.3 percent over last year, largely thanks to rising Medicaid costs.
City officials are planning to ask the other 57 counties in the association to band together with them to face down Albany. "The counties naturally want to partner with New York City," said Robert R. Gregory, executive director of the association. "The city and the mayor have traditionally had a strong voice in Albany, and certainly the economic well-being of the state is very dependent on the economic health of the City of New York."
On the federal level, some lawmakers are seeking either a short-term grant to relieve state Medicaid burdens, or another bill, which passed the Senate last year, that would increase the federal matching level a percentage point or two for states like New York. The White House is cool on this bill, and Congressional leaders are unlikely to support it, said Bush administration and other federal officials. 
"I am hoping that we will be successful in persuading the House and the administration to back at least a temporary fix," Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said yesterday. "Otherwise there will have to be a severe cutback in services." The current formula takes into account the wealth of the state, not the efforts the state has made to insure the poor, she added.
"We provide a much more comprehensive package to people on Medicaid and that costs more," Senator Clinton said. "We have tried to keep up with changing therapies and treatments, and we got punished for trying to do the right thing."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE PRESIDENT; 
Government to Cover Most Costs Of Insurance Losses in Terrorism

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
President Bush signed legislation today requiring that the federal government pick up most of the insurance losses in a catastrophic terrorist attack, a move that represented a political triumph for the White House and some relief for the ailing real estate and construction industry in New York.
 At a formal ceremony in the East Room attended by Mr. Bush's senior political aides and the labor leaders the White House is courting, Mr. Bush said the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, as it is formally known, would restart construction projects that had been put on hold because of the difficulty in getting terrorism insurance since the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 "With this new law, builders and investors can begin construction in real estate projects that have been stalled for too long, and get our hard hats back to work," said Mr. Bush, who was flanked on the East Room stage by a group of construction workers in T-shirts and blue jeans. Mr. Bush asserted that a lack of terrorism insurance had held up or caused the cancellation of more than $15 billion in real estate transactions.
And should terrorists strike America again, Mr. Bush said, "we have a system in place to address financial losses and get our economy back on its feet as quickly as possible."
Mr. Bush campaigned hard for the legislation as a boost to American workers during his political travels for the midterm elections, and calling it a legislative priority in the post-election session of Congress. 
The bill, which does not cover any of the Sept. 11 losses, requires all commercial insurers of buildings to begin offering terrorism coverage immediately. Such coverage had been routinely provided until the Sept. 11 attacks caused losses of more than $40 billion and prompted the industry to withdraw the coverage and ask the White House for help. Some insurers did eventually reintroduce terrorism insurance, but at high cost and in limited amounts.
The bill requires the federal government to pay 90 percent of the cost of an attack by foreign terrorists after losses are greater than $10 billion, up to a total of $100 billion. The government will pay a smaller amount for losses less than $10 billion.
But the legislation does not set the price of terrorism insurance, which industry experts said was likely to remain high.
"The risk is still astronomical," said Gary Karr, the spokesman for the American Insurance Association. "It's going to be a very difficult challenge for companies to figure out the underwriting rules for this. Terrorism is still an extremely difficult risk to predict."
The legislation was welcomed today by the New York real estate industry, which had lobbied extensively for it in Washington. The industry has seen the credit rating lowered on some of the city's major buildings -- among them the Rockefeller Center complex and the Conde Nast and Marriott Marquis towers in Times Square -- because of inadequate terrorism coverage. Other buildings could not get terrorism insurance at all.
"It certainly is hopeful news," said Warren Wechsler, a spokesman for the Real Estate Board of New York, a trade group. "We think this will accelerate the availability and affordability of terrorism insurance."
Mr. Bush signed the bill a week after it passed the Senate by 86 to 11, and 12 days after it cleared the House. Much of the opposition came from House and Senate members in Mr. Bush's own party, who objected to a provision allowing victims of terrorist attacks to sue corporations for punitive damages.
Republicans, who wanted to limit the lawsuits against corporations, were eventually won over by Mr. Bush, who made daily calls in support of the bill and promised that he would strive to put in such limitations next year.
Mr. Bush asserted today that the legislation was crucial to economic recovery, but real estate developers have said that the lack of terrorism insurance is just one factor, and that the bill is not a cure-all. In addition, the bill covers only future acts by foreign groups or nations, and does not cover attacks by Americans, like the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.
But industry experts said today that the bill was likely to have some calming effect on the insurance markets. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, who was among the president's economic advisers on hand today in the East Room, said in a statement that the legislation "reduces the economic risks and economic consequences associated with the threat of future terrorist attacks."
The bill signing, which was attended by Karl Rove and Ken Mehlman, Mr. Bush's top political advisers, was also a sign of how aggressively the White House is pursuing organized labor as a political ally in the re-election campaign. 
Arrayed under the chandeliers were a group of union leaders, chief among them Douglas J. McCarron, the general president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, who is Mr. Bush's closest friend in organized labor. "Appreciate your leadership, Doug," Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Bush also singled out by name Frank Hanley, the general president of the International Union of Operating Engineers; Joe Hunt, general president of the Iron Workers International Union; Ed Sullivan, president of the Building and Construction Trades Department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.; and Terry O'Sullivan, the general president of the Laborers International Union of North America.
Mr. Bush thanked them all for putting "the interest of their membership right on the line" and said that as a result, "the nation's hard-hats will get back to work, being able to put food on the table for their families."

HEADLINE: Strong Allies Are Promoting Aid for United 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. with MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
An intense lobbying battle has broken out over whether to award $1.8 billion in federal loan guarantees to United Airlines, with the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, aggressively supporting the airline's cause. 
 United's main competitors, meanwhile, are asking government officials to reject the guarantees, which they call inappropriate aid for a mismanaged airline and a waste of taxpayers' money. 
 The bipartisan lobbying on behalf of United has reached all the way to the Oval Office. Mr. Hastert, a Republican from United's home state, Illinois, has recently made pleas to President Bush; the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan; Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill; and Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff.
On Monday, Mr. Hastert placed calls to all three members of the federal Air Transportation Stabilization Board, which has the final say on the guarantees, according to a government official close to the matter. A spokesman for Mr. Hastert said the speaker had argued that the airline industry would be devastated if United did not get the guarantees. The airline, the second largest in the nation, has warned that it will seek bankruptcy court protection without the federal aid. 
Battling United are executives of rival airlines. Armed with spreadsheets, they have trouped to the ninth floor of a nondescript office building in downtown Washington to deliver a different message to the air transportation board. A bailout, they say, would hurt the rest of the airline industry while flushing away almost $2 billion of taxpayers' money.
After the Sept. 11 terrorism attacks, Congress passed a package of aid for the ailing airline industry and created the federal board, with Bush administration officials in two of its three slots. Industry officials say they expect the board to decide about United soon, and the lobbying has been accelerating as the Thanksgiving weekend approaches.
The airline industry is expected to lose at least $7 billion this year because of diminished travel and additional security costs. United was ailing even before the attacks, but it is hard to gauge whether it would have ultimately reached such a desperate point without the September shocks and the economic fallout.
Officials of United's parent, UAL, have said that the airline will have to seek bankruptcy protection if it cannot make or extend a $375 million debt payment that is due Monday and if it does not quickly receive the loan guarantees. 
Mr. Hastert has plenty of reason to back United, as his district is near the airline's suburban Chicago headquarters. Mr. Hastert has another close connection to the company: United hired Daniel J. Mattoon, a longtime political adviser and confidante of the speaker, to lobby for the loan guarantees.
United has a bipartisan stable of other well-connected lobbyists and consultants, including Bud Shuster, the former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who was the House transportation chairman; and the Duberstein Group, where Michael Berman, a longtime Democrat and one of Washington's top lobbyists, is counseling United.
Dozens of others have lobbied on behalf of the airline, including Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago, a Democrat who has been in contact with the executive director of the federal air board. Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, has called Mr. O'Neill and high-ranking Transportation Department officials to press United's case. United's unions have flooded the board with 42,000 letters and e-mail messages pleading for the loan package.
United's major competitors have undertaken their own countereffort to convince the board and Bush administration members that the airline has not made cuts deep enough to merit the financial aid. They argue that United would be headed for bankruptcy court even if the Sept. 11 attacks had never happened.
A few executives have publicly challenged United's application. Continental Airlines' chief executive, Gordon M. Bethune, said on CNBC a few days ago that taxpayers should not "subsidize this loser."
The most aggressive lobbying has been before the air transportation board. Some carriers -- including American Airlines, part of AMR; Continental; and Northwest Airlines -- have submitted their own analyses of United's financial condition. Those reports challenge the idea that United's recent cost-cutting will keep it afloat if it gets the loan package. Some industry officials also say that competing airlines may go to court to try to reverse a government award to United.
American, the nation's largest airline, has met with the staff of the board and "given them some pretty in-depth analyses of what we believe United's financial position was" when it applied for the guarantees, said Tim Doke, the vice president for corporate communications at American in Fort Worth. "We tried to make a pretty detailed case that United had serious business issues well in advance" of Sept. 11, he said.
"United simply doesn't qualify" for the guarantees, he added, in part because its financial problems began before the attacks, and, he said, because it should have been able to raise money through other means.
United accuses its competitors of circulating inaccurate information that unfairly casts doubt on its financial viability. United officials and its union leaders say they have made deep, meaningful cuts in the airline's cost structure that will allow it to survive if it gets the loan guarantees. That includes what the airline says are $1.5 billion in wage concessions that will be voted on by its machinists union members on Wednesday. The vote results are not expected until late Wednesday. 
"United is a classic example of why this legislation was passed," said Mr. Shuster, the United lobbyist and former House member. "It has the asset base to provide the assurance that the money is going to be repaid." 
Efforts by other airlines to quash the aid package are understandable, Mr. Shuster said. "They'd like to hurt their competition," he said.
It is not yet clear what the air transportation board will do, or whether the political pressure will help United. Three weeks ago, the board told United that it needed more information, including "further explanation of the assumptions underlying the revenue forecasts" in the airline's business plan.
Today, the board unanimously rejected loan guarantees totaling about $15 million for two small carriers, Medjet International and Corporate Airlines, saying neither had shown "reasonable assurance" that the loans would be repaid. In all, the board has approved guarantees, or conditional guarantees, for five carriers, including US Airways and America West, while rejecting requests from six applications, including the two from small carriers today. After it rejected National Airlines' request earlier this year, the airline shut down.
A White House spokeswoman, Claire Buchan, said that neither Mr. Card nor President Bush had called the board's staff or board members or taken any other action in response to Mr. Hastert's entreaties. "Our view is that the board members should make these decisions on the merits, based on the financial information that is available to them," Ms. Buchan said.
One White House staff member explained that while "Speaker Hastert has been enlisted to push as many buttons as possible on behalf of United," the administration still had concerns about interfering with the free market. "It puts us in a situation of picking winners and losers," the staff member said.
The three members of the loan-guarantee board -- a Treasury under secretary, Peter R. Fisher; a Federal Reserve governor, Edward M. Gramlich; and the general counsel of the Transportation Department, Kirk K. Van Tine -- declined to comment, their aides said this week. A spokeswoman for the board said that "there is no time frame" for a decision. Mr. Greenspan selected Mr. Gramlich to serve in his place, while the Treasury and Transportation Departments named their representatives on the board. 
Frederic Brace III, United's chief financial officer, has met numerous times with the staff of the board and the board's members in the last few weeks. He said he was frustrated by competitors' efforts to mischaracterize United's finances. 
"We would be happy to have the debate occur over the facts of the situation and not over the perception of the situation," he said, "but we are forced by our competitors and pundits to deal with perception." 
Mr. Brace said the debate over the guarantees had become polarized. "In some camps, the debate is what should the airline industry look like, and in other camps they're just trying to apply the law," he said. "It isn't clear which camp is going to prevail."

HEADLINE: Credit Rating Is on the Line, City Is Warned 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
A major credit-rating agency sounded a warning yesterday on New York City's fiscal outlook, citing the large deficits the city is facing over the next few years and outlining risks it sees in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan to balance next year's budget.
 The agency, Standard & Poor's, did not downgrade the city's bond rating, which it held steady at A. But it changed the city's credit outlook to "negative" from "stable," signaling the possibility of a downgrade in the future. 
 The agency assigned the outlook a day after the City Council approved an 18.5 percent increase in the property tax rate and $840 million in budget cuts to close a $1.1 billion gap in the budget for the current fiscal year, and to get a head start on next year's $6.4 billion gap.
Robin Prunty, a credit analyst at S.&P., praised Mayor Bloomberg's approach to balancing the budget and said the package approved by the Council was a "positive step." But she said the projected gaps, and the uncertainty over whether Mayor Bloomberg would win approval from Albany for his proposal to introduce an income tax on commuters, making them pay the same rate as city residents, led the agency to assign a negative outlook. 
"I think the combination of the escalating gaps and the risks associated with achieving a major component of the plan on the revenue side -- the restructuring of the income tax -- were the most important factors" in issuing the warning, Ms. Prunty said in an interview.
The change in outlook brings the S.&P. assessment in line with that of another major rating agency, Moody's Investors Service Inc., which gave the city a negative outlook a year ago. A downgrade would make it more expensive for the city to borrow money, forcing it to pay higher interest rates on its debt to reward investors for taking the extra risk.
Mark Page, the city's budget director, said in a statement: "We are confident that we will successfully manage New York City's finances and deliver the balanced operating results that the city has achieved for the last 22 years. Under the current recession, the task is certainly more difficult, and this change in outlook reflects a perception that although New York City has acted quickly and responsibly, the solution to its fiscal challenges will require the cooperation from other levels of government."
A number of Mayor Bloomberg's proposals to eliminate the budget gap for the next fiscal year would require the help of forces beyond the city's control.
His plan relies on about $1.6 billion in budget relief that would require Albany's approval.
It also calls for $200 million in savings or revenue that would need federal approval. And it counts on winning $600 million in productivity savings from the city's unions.
Mr. Bloomberg's record in getting things from those sources has been mixed. This year, the mayor basically got what he sought from the state, but he fell short with the federal government and the unions.
The largest component of Mr. Bloomberg's plan is the proposed commuter tax. Mayor Bloomberg has called for lowering the personal income tax on city residents and taxing commuters at the new, lower city rate of 2.7 percent. The proposal, which would net the city $1 billion next year, has met with resistance from Republicans in the State Senate and from Gov. George E. Pataki, whose permission would be needed to enact it.
In a statement, S.&P. wrote, "State legislative action on this matter will be a significant challenge and progress on this proposal is largely outside of the city's control."
The $200 million in help that Mr. Bloomberg is seeking from the federal government could come in any of three ways: relaxing the rules governing how the city spends some of the federal aid it receives; reimbursing the city more for providing police protection to foreign dignitaries and the United Nations; or increasing the federal share of Medicaid funding, something states and local governments have sought unsuccessfully for years.
And Mr. Bloomberg would like the unions to come up with $600 million in savings, which could come from longer days for city workers or work-rule changes.
Before S.&P. announced that it had revised the city's credit outlook, Mayor Bloomberg said yesterday that the city had strengthened its case with both Albany and Washington by cutting spending and passing what he said was "probably the largest property tax increase in the history of the city."
"I had said at the beginning, before we could go to Albany, before we could go to Washington, we had to show that we were willing to do as much as we possibly could in terms of sacrifice on the expense side, of not having programs, and sacrifice on the revenue side, of paying more taxes," Mr. Bloomberg said.

HEADLINE: Russia Plans Oil Pipeline to Arctic Port 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
After a year of talk about how to make large-scale oil exports to the United States profitable, the Russian oil industry said today that it had settled on a plan -- a 1,550-mile pipeline to a new oil terminal at Murmansk, the Arctic deepwater port where convoys delivered American war supplies to Russia during World War II.
 Chief executives from four Russian oil companies -- Lukoil, Yukos, Tyumen Oil and Sibneft -- signed a memorandum of understanding today to pursue the project, which would connect with Russia's existing pipeline network. The project was first mentioned in May by Lukoil; it has oil fields not far from Murmansk that are mostly untapped. 
 Though the project will not deliver any oil until at least 2007, it is still seen as strategically important for both Russia and the United States, which has sought to diversify its supplies away from the Middle East, where political tensions are raising the prospect of supply disruptions. The companies said the new route could increase Russia's share of American oil imports to 13 percent from a negligible amount now. 
The Murmansk project is intended to handle as much as 1.6 million barrels of oil a day eventually. The shipping route from Murmansk to the United States is shorter than that from the Persian Gulf, and though it is prone to poor weather, it does not pass near any political trouble spots. It also provides Russia with a badly needed new export channel; its current export channels, controlled mostly by a state-run monopoly pipeline network called Transneft, are rapidly reaching maximum capacity.
The project "will allow us to resolve one of the acute problems for Russian oil companies that limits us in competition on world markets," said Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, chief executive of Yukos. "That's the problem of transport."
Russia now exports 3.2 million barrels of oil a day, making it the world's second-largest exporter after Saudi Arabia. But rising volumes are quickly filling existing pipelines, which now have a capacity of 3.9 million barrels a day, according to the International Center for Petroleum Business Studies in Moscow. Nearly all of it goes to Europe.
Analysts have argued that it is not important how oil gets to market -- either through direct deliveries or by sales to traders and commodity exchanges -- because a shortage in one part of the world can be covered by any number of different producers. Ultimately, they argue, it is price and shipping costs that determine where any importer, like the United States, buys its oil.
Low shipping costs, the Russian companies said today, are at the heart of the business plan for the project, which proposes two pipeline routes, with costs of $4.5 billion and $3.4 billion. The rough blueprint of the project, presented today, estimates a transport cost to the United States of $3.38 a barrel.
For comparison, shipping costs from the Persian Gulf to the United States have ranged from 75 cents to $3.50, said Adam E. Sieminski, an oil analyst at Deutsche Bank in London. 
"It's not a very competitive rate," he said. "When someone wants to charter a tanker or buy a load of oil, they won't be looking there first."
But the companies say the rate is competitive. And the direct deliveries develop relationships that lead to longer-term contracts, executives said. In an interview last month, Bruce Misamore, chief financial officer at Yukos, said Yukos hoped to increase its long-term contracts to up to 80 percent of its exports.
Direct deliveries give "more solidity to the relationship than just selling spot cargoes," he said.
"Developing of long-term contracts between Russian companies is no different than what already exists between American companies and other countries in the world," he said. "American companies have direct contracts with Mexico and Venezuela."
This summer, Yukos sent two tankers of oil to a port in Texas. In a statement in August, the company said the shipments "appeared to be economic," but gave no details.
The project brings together four fractious oil companies in a union that is rare in Russia. Suspicions and rivalries that date back to Russia's state asset sales in the mid-1990's have served to set private Russian companies against one other.
While Russian oil companies have worked together to press the government to accept their position on issues like taxes and export quotas, in other matters they work solo.
One participant, the executive director of Tyumen Oil, German Khan, noted this in comments at a news conference. "It's an important uniting step in a new history," he said. "Before we signed joint appeals to the government. Maybe it's the first stage of this new history."
Murmansk is virtually the only deepwater port in Russia that can accommodate large oil tankers. A military city where nuclear submarines were based in Soviet times, Murmansk has long been seen by the Russian oil industry as a convenient shipping port. Those plans were left to languish for years, opposed by Russia's military.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Dow Jumps 255 as Investors React to Economic Reports

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street barreled higher yesterday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average more than 250 points, as investors took heart in a string of positive economic data. The rally brought the major gauges back to levels not seen since the summer. 
 Trading was light in the preholiday session, but the gains were big with the Nasdaq composite index picking up more than 40 points. 
 The sharp advance defied expectations that stocks would pull back after nearly two months of rallies and that traders would not want to commit themselves ahead of the holiday weekend. 
Investors received a lift from a jump in consumer spending. They also reacted to a spike in orders to factories for big-ticket items and an increase in manufacturing activity in the Midwest. Analysts said the positive reports eased investors' concerns that the economy could slip back into recession. 
"The numbers suggest the economy is indeed resilient and the consumer has stayed on track where spending is concerned," said Kevin Caron, a market strategist with Ryan, Beck & Company. 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 255.26 points, or 2.9 percent, to close at 8,931.68. The Dow more than recouped the 172.98 points lost in the previous session and is on its way to an eighth consecutive winning week. 
The last time the Dow closed higher was Aug. 22 when it stood at 9,053.60. 
In another sign of the market's momentum, the Dow posted its best day before Thanksgiving ever, surpassing the 2.5 percent gain in 1957, said Markethistory.com, a financial research Web site. 
The broader market, up for six of the last seven weeks, was also higher yesterday. The Nasdaq composite index rose 43.51 points, or 3 percent, to 1,487.94. The last time the Nasdaq finished higher was June 19, when it was at 1,496.83. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 25.56 points, or 2.8 percent, to 938.87. The last time the S.& P. finished higher was Aug. 26, when it stood at 947.95. 
"Today, the market couldn't hold back; it had to respond to the batch of positive economic news," said Peter Cardillo, president and chief strategist of Global Partner Securities. 
Trading was light ahead of Thanksgiving. The market is closed today and will be open for a half-day tomorrow. 
Yesterday's gains came after a report showed that consumers ratcheted up spending by 0.4 percent in October. It was the biggest increase in three months, and a turnaround from September's drop of 0.4 percent. 
The market's upward momentum intensified after reports on durable goods and manufacturing activity in the Midwest. The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at least three years -- rose 2.8 percent in October, exceeding the expectations of economists for a 1.8 percent gain.
The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago reported that its index of area manufacturing activity rose to 54.3 in November from 45.9 in October. Analysts said the reports built a strong case for a resilient economy, rather than one that was prone to reverting back to recession. 
Shares in retailers traded higher on the consumer spending report. Target rose $1.72, to $35.30, and Best Buy advanced $1.41, to $27.03. 
Auto and appliance makers received a lift from the durable goods report. DaimlerChrysler climbed $1.73, to $35.50, while Maytag rose $1.29, to $30.24. 
The drug maker Eli Lilly surged $5, to $69, on news that it had received government approval of two drugs on Tuesday and that Standard & Poor's had upgraded its stock. 
Technology also had solid gains. For nearly two months, the technology sector has fared the best in rallies, a sign that investors are growing more confident about the economy's progress. 
Microsoft rose $1.18, to $58.08, and Cisco Systems climbed 38 cents, to $14.83. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
(By Reuters) -- Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday after upbeat economic data powered a rally in stocks and sapped demand for the safe haven of debt securities. 
A cautious tone in the Federal Reserve's anecdotal beige book on economic activity failed to stem bond market losses after reports showing strength in regional manufacturing, durable goods and the jobs sector. 
The 10-year note fell 1 18/32 , to a price of 97 30/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.26 percent, from 4.07 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 22 2/32 , to 104. The bond's yield rose to 5.11 percent, from 4.93 percent on Tuesday.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes:

HEADLINE: The Truth About Squire Romolee 

BYLINE:  By Laurel Thatcher Ulrich; Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, a professor of history at Harvard University, is author, most recently, of "The Age of Homespun: Objects and Stories in the Creation of an American Myth."

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.H. 

 BODY:
As I unbag a free-range turkey bought at my local grocery store, I think of the description of a Thanksgiving dinner in a now-forgotten novel. "Northwood, A Tale of New England," published in Boston in 1827, launched Sarah Josepha Hale's literary career. More than three decades later, as the influential editor of Godey's Lady's Book, she helped persuade Abraham Lincoln to declare Thanksgiving a national holiday.
 The Thanksgiving dinner in "Northwood" takes place in the home of a prosperous New Hampshire farmer whom Hale calls Squire Romolee. On two tables pushed together in the parlor a roasted turkey keeps company with a succulent goose, a pair of ducklings, a sirloin of beef, a leg of pork, a joint of mutton and an immense chicken pie. 
 Surrounding this culinary menagerie is a colorful array of vegetables, pickles and preserves. A slice of wheat bread sits on the glass tumbler at the head of each plate. A separate table displays cake, plum pudding, custards, pies of every description, sweetmeats, currant wine, cider and ginger beer. 
When a visiting Englishman asks Squire Romolee how he can claim the virtue of temperance in the face of such a feast, the happy farmer exclaims, "Well, well, I may at least recommend industry, for all this variety you have seen before you on the table, excepting the spices and salt, has been furnished from my own farm and procured by our own labor and care."
Hale's Yankee farmer, more than Pilgrims in stiff white collars, epitomizes the American Thanksgiving. It is our most authentic national holiday. Each November, Americans push tables together, gathering friends and families around them to acknowledge, among other gifts, the essential American blessings -- material abundance and the ability to enjoy the product of "our own labor and care." We still watch fireworks on the Fourth of July, but the oratory and civic parades that once marked the nation's birthday have largely faded. The Thanksgiving feast endures.
Thanksgiving's authenticity has nothing to do with its presumed origins in Pilgrim Plymouth. Certainly, there were harvest meals in colonial New England, as in other agricultural societies, though seldom in drear November. Early American governors did indeed proclaim official "thanksgivings" and "fasts" according to the ebb and flow of war and the weather. During the Revolutionary War the Continental Congress followed their example. But the national holiday we know today was created in the 19th century as writers like Hale romanticized the presumably rural roots of the American character.
When Abraham Lincoln made Thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863, his official proclamation might have doubled as a fast-day sermon. The president not only invited his fellow citizens to give thanks for "singular deliverances and blessings" but also to ask forgiveness for the sins that had led to deaths "in the camp, the siege, and the battlefield." That Lincoln appealed to "the whole American people" suggests both his faith in the concept of one nation and his hope for an eventual Union victory. But the "whole" he addressed was rent. He commended to God's care "all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners, or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged."
This part of the Thanksgiving story, like the slavery that ripped apart the nation, has been forgotten.
Thanksgiving's authenticity does not derive from its history but from the way it renews, year after year, the dream of American abundance. An overflowing table convinces us that we are indeed uniquely blessed and perhaps uniquely worthy. It is hardly surprising, then, that the canonical Thanksgiving locates the roots of American nationhood in a Pilgrim feast rather than a Virginia tobacco bonanza, where it perhaps belongs.
Historically the successful cultivation of tobacco at Jamestown in the 1620's was far more important than the landing of a motley band of religious dissenters on the coast of New England. But plantation agriculture is an inconvenient foundation for a national mythology. Nor did our national myth-makers know quite what to do with Pocahontas. Even in her recent Disney revival, as a child of nature who tries to save her people from war, she symbolizes a lost American dream. Squanto is a much more manageable hero. He facilitates the feast, then fades into history, blessing the nation with his disappearance. On the American table, Indian corn, pumpkin pie and roast turkey incorporate the Indian story without the Indians.
Thanks to Sarah Josepha Hale and her contemporaries, Thanksgiving became a cherished national festival. Thanksgiving is a successful holiday because it is capable of such infinite variation. Each of us chooses our own circle, our own setting, our own meanings, but we are united in a common commitment to possessing and sharing the ordinary blessings of food and friendship.
I confess that I look forward to the familiar menu, the overflowing table and the gathering of family and friends. One year I even reproduced the dinner served at Squire Romolee's house, though I needed the help of an entire church women's organization. This experience was a reminder, if I needed one, that even in early America no family could do it all themselves.
I love Hale's story but, as a historian who has spent many years studying the rural economy of early New England, I am compelled to point out that there never was a self-sufficient New Hampshire farm. Family labor and slave labor, subsistence agriculture and plantation agriculture, local production and English manufacturing were entwined in the international economy that made colonial settlement possible. A closer look at the actual historical setting in which Hale placed her fictional farmer makes that clear.
Hale calls her hero squire and gives him the biggest house in the village. Missing from the picture, though, is how a prosperous farmer like Squire Romolee would have been deeply connected to the commerce that linked New England with the ports and plantations of the Caribbean, the South and Europe. There are fowls in the squire's dooryard, sheep in his pasture and cattle in his fields, but in real life the salted meat and tanned hides that flowed from a farm like his helped to sustain an Atlantic economy made rich by slavery.
Fields belonging to a farmer like Squire Romolee produced rye and Indian corn and pumpkins for the Thanksgiving pie, but the wheat in the slice of bread crowning each tumbler at the festal table, like the tumblers themselves, would have arrived by ship. The wives and daughters of the New England gentry spun and wove sheets and towels and scratchy woolen blankets, but their Sunday dresses were made of imported silk or calico. On Thanksgiving, men drank cider pressed from local apples, but when there was a militia muster or a church-raising, they shared rum distilled from slave-grown sugar.
It would also be a mistake to hold too firmly to Hale's portrait of a New England bathed in peace. In the century before the American Revolution, New Hampshire was a mountainous borderland between New England and New France, an Abenaki Indian enclave and a nursery -- on all sides -- of terror, counter-raiding and war. The farmers who inherited this battleground turned up Indian bones with their plows.
In Squire Romolee's feast, Sarah Josepha Hale gave mythic meaning to an essentially domestic festival, offering ordinary Americans an opportunity to join their own stories to the national story through feasting and sharing. But her idyll is important not only for what it included, but for what it left out. As we give thanks today, we should take pleasure in Hale's tale -- but we might also consider the message in Lincoln's proclamation.

PERSON: James L. Dutt 

HEADLINE: James L. Dutt, 77, Ex-Head Of the Beatrice Companies 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
James L. Dutt, a former chairman of the Beatrice Companies -- once a sprawling consumer products conglomerate with brands as disparate as Tropicana orange juice, Playtex undergarments and Samsonite luggage -- died Oct. 28 at his home in Charlotte, N.C. He was 77.
 His death was ruled a suicide by the Mecklenburg County medical examiner, according to the Charlotte Police Department. 
 A native of Topeka, Kan., Mr. Dutt started part time as an accountant at Beatrice in 1947 while he was still in college, and later became a dairy plant manager. 
When Mr. Dutt became chairman in 1979, Beatrice had a net income and a breadth of products that rivaled those of Kraft, Procter & Gamble and General Foods. 
Mr. Dutt pared some of Beatrice's 400 units, like its chemical division and its food service equipment operations, while buying others. 
His most notable acquisition was Esmark Inc., the owner of a distribution network for Hunt-Wesson foods. Mr. Dutt's hope was that Esmark would provide the framework for Beatrice to build a national distribution system. 
When he made his acquisition intentions known in 1984, Esmark had already accepted a $2.4 billion takeover offer from Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the New York investment firm that specialized in leveraged buyouts.
Mr. Dutt sweetened the offer and won Esmark for $2.8 billion, making the acquisition, at the time, one of the largest outside the oil industry. 
"This is a company where something happens," Mr. Dutt said about Beatrice in an interview in 1984, after the Esmark deal. "Most people work in a place where in their whole life nothing happens. Here something happens every day."
But some industry analysts argued that Mr. Dutt had paid too much for Esmark and that he had taken on too much debt and had diluted earnings. 
Analysts and company employees also criticized Mr. Dutt for what seemed to be a brain drain at Beatrice, as more than two dozen senior executives departed during his tenure.
Directors unexpectedly ousted Mr. Dutt in mid-1985, while he and 600 other Beatrice employees were attending a car race in Wisconsin.
Beatrice was later bought by TLC. The combined company, TLC Beatrice, became mired in financial difficulties. Its businesses were eventually sold, piece by piece, and the company was liquidated by the late 1990's.
After leaving Beatrice, Mr. Dutt formed a consulting firm, Stratxx, that was first based in Chicago, and later in Charlotte.
He also held executive positions at Mailboxes Coast to Coast and J. Ray McDermott S.A., a New Orleans marine construction company.
Mr. Dutt is survived by two daughters, Joan Dutt and Nancy Veatch; a son, Thomas; three brothers, Charles, Wendell and John; and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: New York Economy Shows Slight Gains but Is Still Weak, Reports Say 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Economists are finding a few faint rays of sunlight in the New York City region's otherwise dark and murky economic picture, according to a series of reports released yesterday by government and private groups.
 In one report, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that since October, employment, retail sales and manufacturing have improved. But with the exception of manufacturing, which takes place almost entirely outside the city, the gains have been weak. 
 "The overall pace of activity still looks soft," the New York bank reported in the "beige book," which is the Federal Reserve's periodic assessment of economic conditions around the country. "Real estate markets continue to cool off, and there is downward pressure on goods and service prices."
Retail sales improved slightly compared with sales earlier this fall, as colder weather drove New Yorkers to buy new clothes, the report says. Even so, it says, apparel sales remain weak, and shoppers were spending less on food by buying discount brands.
As for employment, the pace of hiring picked up a bit in October, but demand for labor remains weak, "particularly in the market for temps," the report says.
A similarly mixed picture was drawn by the monthly survey of purchasing managers done by the New York chapter of the Institute for Supply Management. After slipping for five months, the group's index of business conditions in New York City rose slightly in November, to its highest level since last June. 
Even so, a majority of managers surveyed said they expected the economy to tread water next year, rather than improving. Given problems like layoffs in the financial services industry, the group warned, "there are no guarantees that the current economic twilight is the precursor of sunrise, rather than the opposite."
The New York City comptroller's office, which monitors the local economy, said yesterday that indicators that tend to predict future economic activity were mixed in the third quarter of this year.
The seasonally adjusted index of help-wanted ads fell 9 percent in the quarter, to its lowest level in 50 years, and is down 26.5 percent compared with a year ago. But the number of building permits rose compared with last year, although the 2001 level was sharply reduced because of the aftershocks of the terrorist attack.
The city economy remained in recession in the third quarter, the comptroller's office said, even as the national economy continued to grow, as it has for a year. The comptroller's estimate of gross city product fell by 0.1 percent, the seventh straight quarterly decline, while the national economy grew by 4 percent.
While the number of jobs in the city shrank by about 2,000 in the July-September stretch, income from jobs rose by about 4.7 percent, as measured by personal income tax collections, the comptroller's office said. But income from investments, which has been an important source of city revenues, continued to drop, falling 3.6 percent.
"The continuation of this recession will only increase the burden on our budget," said the comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., in a statement.
The Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that among major metropolitan areas, New York had the second highest unemployment rate in October, 7.2 percent, which was also the rate in Miami. That was surpassed only by 7.9 percent reported in San Jose, Calif., the hub of Silicon Valley, which has had the highest rate among big cities for the last seven months.

HEADLINE: It's Cranberry Season, On Table and in Court 

BYLINE:  By JULIE FLAHERTY 

 BODY:
The harvest has ended for most cranberry growers, who have shipped off their crops of deep red berries to be dried, juiced or made into Thanksgiving or Christmas condiments. 
 But for Ocean Spray Cranberries, a cooperative of some 800 cranberry farmers based in Lakeville, Mass., November has been a trying month. On Nov. 6, Robert Hawthorne, who had been Ocean Spray's chief executive only since 2000, resigned unexpectedly. Two days later, two independent cranberry processors filed an antitrust lawsuit against the co-op, charging Ocean Spray with using its market dominance illegally to "thwart and cripple them in the marketplace." It was not the first suit against Ocean Spray. 
 "Everybody's upset about it," said Linc Thacher, 68, who owns bogs in Harwich and Brewster, Mass., and has been an Ocean Spray member for 50 years. "Win or lose, it's going to cost us a lot of money to defend ourselves." 
The lawsuit comes after some challenging years. The price of a 100-pound barrel of cranberries fell from a high of $66 in 1996 to a low of $17 in 2000.
This year Ocean Spray plans to pay its growers $21 to $24 a barrel. Yet for many growers, particularly in Massachusetts, dry weather contributed to a below-average yield this year, giving them fewer barrels to sell. 
"We were just beginning to make a little recovery in the prices, and this could be a setback for everybody," Mr. Thacher said of the lawsuit. "It just puts a black eye on the whole industry if we're fighting amongst ourselves." 
The lawsuit was filed by Northland Cranberries, based in Wisconsin, and a defunct cranberry processor from Duxbury, Mass., named Clermont, which says Ocean Spray's practices ran it out of business.
The suit claims, in part, that competitors have suffered as Ocean Spray "engaged in a systematic scheme to violate the antitrust laws by participating in agreements in restraint of trade and by exploiting its extraordinary market power."
Chris Phillips, a spokesman for Ocean Spray, said the company would defend itself vigorously against the complaint."We compete fairly in the marketplace," he said. "Our company and all members of the cranberry industry have struggled through some difficult years. We have been subjected to all of the same market forces as our competitors. We will continue to compete fairly and lead this industry as we always have."
Northland's chief executive, John Swendrowski, called Ocean Spray an "international cartel" that controls three-quarters of the nation's cranberry supply. Northland was once a member of Ocean Spray but left in 1993.
"Their actions can dramatically increase the price or they can dramatically reduce the price," he said. "The marketplace should be entitled to that control through competition."
The lawsuit also claims that Ocean Spray surreptitiously rearranged store shelves to prevent the restocking of Northland products, paid retailers not to sell those products and gave out false information about Northland products. 
Ten months ago, Northland restructured to avoid bankruptcy. For the most recent fiscal year, it had $53.8 million in net income.
In a previous lawsuit against Ocean Spray, Decas Cranberry Products, an independent cranberry grower and seller in Wareham, Mass., filed an antitrust suit against it in the 1980's. But the suit was settled after three years of litigation. 
John C. Decas, the company's president, said Ocean Spray had recently made progress in working with independents like himself, including cooperating on studies of the fruit's health benefits. But the cooperative has undue control, he said.
"They set the price on each and every cranberry item that is sold," he said. "When they make a bad decision, like they are this year with fresh fruit, we suffer because of it." 
Fresh berries are a more difficult crop to produce and account for only 3 percent of Ocean Spray's sales, Mr. Phillips said. Because of a small crop of fresh berries this year, Ocean Spray has stopped taking orders for them. But because Ocean Spray set a price for fresh fruit in September, independent sellers like Mr. Decas say they will not be able to raise their prices in response to tighter demand.
"Two weeks ago they announced to the trade that they are taking no more orders," Mr. Decas said, "yet they are spending a fortune promoting something they don't have enough of. We had to establish the same price."
A shortage of cranberries? Two years ago, the industry produced so much fruit that the Agriculture Department told growers to cut back 15 percent on their crops to keep them from flooding the marketplace.
The growing frenzy began in the mid-1990's, when prices were high, encouraging farmers to invest heavily in new marshes.
"When these new marshes came into berrying stage, prices had already begun to collapse," said Ed Jesse, an agricultural economist at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. "I don't think we're ever going back to the halcyon days of $60-per-barrel pricing," he said. But he added, "Demand will catch up with supply -- the gap is not that big."
As for Ocean Spray's leadership, its grower-owners have made it clear that the cooperative's improved market share has not given them the prices they want. 
Although Mr. Hawthorne's decision to resign was his own, "clearly the board agreed that it was time for a change," said Mr. Phillips, the company spokesman. "There is a need for a different set of skills to take us to the next level." 
Barbara S. Thomas, a board member and former president of a Warner Lambert division, will act as Ocean Spray's interim chief executive while a search is conducted.
The growers who own Ocean Spray have been struggling, Mr. Phillips said. "They've seen the business grow healthier," he said, "but they haven't seen sufficient returns. Until we accomplish that, we won't regain their confidence."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Red Sox Have the Thinking Fan's Writer on Their Side

BYLINE:  By TYLER KEPNER 

 BODY:
A couple of Saturdays ago, in a borrowed office at Fenway Park, Bill James realized what all his writing, theorizing, number crunching and head scratching were about. For six hours, Theo Epstein briefed James on potential trades and free-agent signings the Boston Red Sox could make this winter. James, baseball's ultimate outsider for 25 years, was suddenly very much on the inside. And he loved it.
 "I really had a feeling like this is what I've always been preparing to do," James said, reflecting on that meeting last week. "This is what I should be doing." 
 Now, at last, he is doing it. The Red Sox recently hired James as a senior adviser and are consulting him on all player moves. It is another unconventional step for the woebegone franchise that this week named Epstein, at 28, the youngest general manager in baseball history. 
"These will not be your father's Red Sox," Larry Lucchino, the team president, said. "We have to do things in new, different and innovative ways. We have 84 years of data to establish that perhaps there are other ways that will work better."
The Red Sox, who have not won the World Series since 1918, want to take advantage of the insights that have made James famous. James, 53, spawned an information revolution in baseball after he began writing the annual "Bill James Baseball Abstract" in 1977. The first edition sold 75 copies. By the time he wrote the last, in 1988, it was a best seller and a bible for the thinking fan.
James delighted in testing time-worn theories and reporting the surprising results. George Brett said AstroTurf shortened careers; James found the opposite was true. The Baltimore Orioles started Storm Davis on opening day because hard throwers were believed to do better in cold weather; James discovered hard throwers usually did worse.
"The 'Baseball Abstract' is, if not quite anti-establishment, at least determinedly non-establishment," he wrote in 1986. "I like to re-examine my attitudes; I think it's fun, and occasionally I learn something. The essential work of the 'Abstract' is to challenge traditional wisdom about baseball."
That is what Lucchino and the principal owner of the Red Sox, John Henry, want from him. James's first assignment for the team was an 86-page report on the state of the franchise. "It's never very far from my right hand," Lucchino said.
As president of the Baltimore Orioles in the late 1980's, Lucchino oversaw the construction of Camden Yards, which started a trend toward old-style ballparks with modern amenities. When he speaks of James, Lucchino talks in architectural terms, saying James is providing the Red Sox with quick, focused studies when issues arise.
For example, Epstein said, the Red Sox recently had interest in acquiring a pitcher who had a serious injury a few years ago. James was asked to find the odds that a pitcher with that injury, at that age, would regain his effectiveness or improve. Without citing specifics, Epstein said James's research was very useful and indicated a strong trend.
"He is not just going to be a fitful participant," Lucchino said. "He is going to be an integral, integrated part of our front office, and we're proud of that fact. I've called it a minor coup, and that's probably a minor understatement. There aren't many people on the planet who have the historical perspective that he has, putting aside his database and analytical abilities. He adds a very important dimension."
James will write his reports from his office in Lawrence, Kan., and make four one-week trips a year to Boston. His distance from Fenway Park could be an asset.
"My job is to try to help them think clearly about the problems they face," James said, "and backing away from the problem does have some value. I think. I hope."
 The use of statistical gurus in front offices is not new. Lucchino hired an analyst in Baltimore, and the former Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette was criticized for his perceived reliance on an adviser named Mike Gimbel. The Yankees and the Mets use statistical analysis to supplement scouting.
"If we don't start thinking outside the box, we're not really challenging ourselves," said Toronto Blue Jays General Manager J. P. Ricciardi, who has a statistical adviser on his staff. "But there's a lot of skepticism. We live in a world where, if it's different, there must be something wrong with it."
As the leader and pioneer in a field that challenges traditional baseball logic, James is altogether different. Russell Roberts, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis who read the "Baseball Abstract" when it was photocopied in the late 1970's, said James could have a substantial influence.
"I've always liked him because he's interested in tradeoffs and using numbers to verify hypotheses, which is what economists do," Roberts said. "Every baseball team has people who collect numbers; there are all kinds of statisticians like that. But that's not what Bill James does. He tries to replace emotion and so-called intuition with a more accurate evaluation that's based on reality. That will be very useful to a team that takes him seriously."
The Red Sox do, particularly Epstein, who eagerly read the "Abstract" series while growing up in the 1980's. He joined Boston's front office last spring, after the ownership group led by Henry, Tom Werner and Lucchino took over. At a meeting with Henry in August, Epstein mentioned James's name, mostly as a joke.
But Henry, the principal owner, was intrigued. He began sending e-mail messages to James.
"He asked me, 'I always wanted to know why you didn't work for a major league team,' " James said. "I thought, wait a minute, that's kind of an interesting question for a major league owner to ask you."
The Red Sox offered a one-year contract with several club options, and James was thrilled to accept. He had done low-level consulting work for teams before, but nothing permanent, and nothing that placed him in an inner circle.
For James, the timing was perfect. For the first time in 20 years, he said, he does not owe a publisher a new book. That freedom made it easy to take a job in baseball, even if he had not considered it for years.
When he started writing the "Abstract" series, he said, he knew he was on to something. His theories made sense to legions of readers, but baseball ignored him, partly because he was a consultant to agents in salary-arbitration cases. By the early 1980's, James had stopped indulging himself in fantasies of running a team.
"When I was young and naive, I assumed that when you demonstrated that something was false, everybody would say, 'Oh, I didn't know that,' and stop doing what it was that had been demonstrated as being useless or counterproductive," James said. "Of course, the world doesn't work like that."
In Epstein, Lucchino and Henry, James believes he has found like-minded people willing to challenge old ideas. James's insights will be used to supplement traditional scouting methods, Epstein stressed, and Lucchino sees no downside.
"You're either going to get great harmony at best, or creative dissonance at worst," Lucchino said. "Both of those things are pretty helpful."
Some of James's previous studies on the Red Sox are no longer relevant, he said, because Fenway is not the hitters' park it once was. Newer parks are more beneficial to hitters, he said, and the construction of a new seating tier behind home plate has severely altered wind patterns.
Some of James's general beliefs have caught on, especially his emphasis on the value of on-base percentage compared with batting average. But his thinking remains unconventional in other areas, particularly the composition and use of the bullpen.
This could be one area in which the team reflects James's influence. The Red Sox are seeking several relievers this winter but do not, Epstein said, feel bound by what has become the accepted bullpen formula: two long men, two left-handers, setup man, closer. That structure also strikes James as illogical.
"The 21st-century plan for how you use your closer is very poorly designed to get your best reliever into the game at the most important times," he said in an e-mail message. "The most important time to have a good pitcher on the mound in the late innings -- the highest-impact situation -- is with the game tied. Modern managers (post-1980) won't use their best reliever in the situation in which a run allowed has the greatest impact."
James insists he will not pass along his theories to the Red Sox manager, Grady Little, unless Little seeks him out. He believes most of his methods are more relevant to front-office decisions than managerial moves, and he is probably wary of overstepping his bounds.
This is the chance of his lifetime, after all, and for all of the formulas he has analyzed, the most basic is this: For every winner, there is a loser. James's impact -- the impact of an outsider's movement on the inner workings of the game -- will be evaluated in the most traditional way. 
"It will have a lot more significance if we succeed than if we fail," he said. "If I'm not able to succeed and the relationship is terminated after a couple of years, it's just a footnote. If we're able to make it work and have success as an organization, it could become something more than that."

HEADLINE: Down by Town's Old Mill, Hopes of a Revival Surge 

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY 

DATELINE: NEWTON FALLS, N.Y., Nov. 25 

 BODY:
Nearly two months have passed since the people of this remote hamlet, in a remote town in a remote county in the northern Adirondacks, gathered to do something they had not done in a very long time. They flexed some emotional muscles that had gone slack, and they cheered.
 Noise of any kind is rare these days in Newton Falls. For a century, life was lived to the welcome sounds that more affluent communities might rail against: machine groans and truck whines and train clatters, the cacophony of commerce. But the paper mill shut down two years ago, ending its status as the area's largest employer and provoking the resounding silence. 
Until those cheers, that is, which rang through the pines one late September day, when dignitaries announced in the mill's parking lot that a Canadian company had bought the plant and expected to hire as many as 129 people here -- roughly the number of those who had lost their jobs when the mill shut down. 
Finally, it seemed, one of the rare rumors of hope being whispered by men hunched at the bar of the Newton Falls Hotel was coming true. Just when upstate factory shutdowns had become almost a cliche, here was a startling news flash:
Upstate Mill to Reopen.
The announcement did not include an opening date, highlighting the gap between words and action. But another upstate mill bought by the same owner has already opened, giving people here more reason to assume that the good news is real.
"It's a huge deal for us," said Christopher Westbrook, the president of the economic development committee for the towns of Clifton and Fine, whose combined population of 2,400 includes the few dozen residents of Newton Falls.
The news quickly made its way 200 miles to Tom Manchester, one of the area's many sons and daughters to leave home for a far-away job. He has asked economic development officials in St. Lawrence County to include his name on the list of former mill employees interested in coming back.
For him and his wife, Jackie, the reasons cannot be more basic. "Pretty much our whole families are up there," he said.
But for now, at least, he is staying put. Like all mill veterans, he has not forgotten how brutal the paper business can be.
Stuart Belkin, the president of Belkorp Industries, the company that now owns the mill, has bought four other mills in the Northeast over the last year or so, including one in nearby Deferiet. The plants will work together to produce high-quality recycled paper, he said, but many things must fall into place, particularly a greater demand for recycled goods.
That was why his comments on that gleeful September day in Newton Falls were so tempered.
"These people have been through a hard time," he said later, "so their optimism and expectations have definitely been kindled. It's a serious responsibility, because people are certainly counting on a turn for the better."
Two of Mr. Belkin's five plants are operating -- including the one in Deferiet -- and company officials are not yet sure which one to open next. Maybe it will be the one in Newton Falls, maybe by July; maybe. Until that decision is made, far from Newton Falls, people around here look and listen for signs.
"There are more lights at the mill now," said Anne Hynes, a Newton Falls resident whose father worked in the mill and whose uncle once served as its president. "It's not a lot; it's not like it used to be. But there's activity."
More lights would be nice for the towns of Clifton and Fine. They have taken their fair share of upstate's economic blows -- a steel mill's shutdown in the 1970's cost several hundred jobs -- but the last two years have tested the community's emotional infrastructure more than any storm of winter.
There was the closing of the paper mill in late 2000; 125 people out of a job and a smokestack gone cold. There was the fire that destroyed another source of local pride, the firehouse. And there was the death of Shannon Adams, a graduate of the small Clifton-Fine school district and just 25 years old. He had been so proud of the address on his business card: Tower One, 101st Floor, World Trade Center.
But the people of Clifton-Fine have uncommon spirit, local and state officials say; they refuse to submit. They formed task forces to foster economic development and local pride, and now the community's center, Star Lake, has a new bakery, a new pharmacy, a new bed-and-breakfast.
They also helped to court prospective buyers for the closed mill, a process that reached its nadir when a would-be mill owner wanted to get a sense of his potential work force. More than 100 people showed up for the meeting he called in December 2001, but he was out of the picture before the thaw.
"There were several other people who were interested, and we tried to stay in real close contact," said Mr. Westbrook, who is also the director of the state ranger school in Wanakena. "But they faded."
Then, in May, Mr. Westbrook traveled to Watertown to join representatives of St. Lawrence County and the Empire State Development Corporation in trying to charm a new suitor, this one a businessman from western Canada. Rumors swept through town that the meeting had been positive; that this Stuart Belkin was smitten.
It was a long summer. Jean Burrows, the owner of the Newton Falls Hotel, said that every time she went to the bank in Star Lake, she was asked the same thing: "What are you hearing? What are you hearing?"
The usual snags developed during negotiations, and the usual sweeteners were thrown in by the county and the Pataki administration: $500,000 in state transportation funds here, a $500,000 capital grant there, some bureaucratic sleight-of-hand that allowed the new owners to receive significant tax breaks.
Finally, they had a deal. Mr. Belkin bought the mill from a company in Atlanta that never intended to get into the paper business. He declined to reveal the sales price, but said that the Newton Falls and Deferiet plants were bought "for a fraction of their conventionally ascribed value."
Next came the celebration. Gov. George E. Pataki arrived in a motorcade that followed the tree-lined road to the mill, not the one that wends past the remnants of the old steel plant. He was in the midst of a re-election campaign, of course, but no other governor in memory had ever been to Newton Falls.
Signs that thanked Belkorp and the governor for saving the mill hung from tree trunks and store windows. Two schoolchildren sang a song that one of their teachers had written called "Possibilities." There were homemade cakes to eat, and speeches to hear, and rounds of drinks to buy at the hotel, and people, so many people.
"It's one of the most remarkable days I've spent in public service," said Raymond Meier, the area's state senator. "When you hear someone say the whole town turned out, well -- the whole town turned out."
Great as it was, that day had to end. Mr. Pataki went back to Albany, Mr. Belkin back to Vancouver. Now it is late November, the pine branches are sagging with snow, and the hamlet of Newton Falls waits for its quiet to end.
What a wonderful day that was when the governor came to town, Ms. Hynes said. "But the happiest day will be when the smoke comes out of the stack."

HEADLINE: Landfill to Park? Give It Time; 
The Transformation of Fresh Kills Will Take Decades

BYLINE:  By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
When the Fresh Kills landfill closed last year, Staten Islanders exhaled.
 They had complained bitterly about the landfill since it opened 55 years ago, but once it was finally shut down, rumors began to fly. What was going to happen to the four square miles of space left behind? 
 "We heard ski slopes and golf courses and stuff like that," said Susan Marchitelli, who moved to Staten Island six years ago. "But I think it should be a park. A lot of green; a lot of green. Extend the wildlife preserve. Start over. Plant it. Make it green." 
That is just what the city has said it will do. Eventually.
"In one fell swoop, it will be the largest park in the city," Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe said last week.
The city is planning to select a winning design in January from three finalists in a competition sponsored by the Department of City Planning and the Municipal Arts Society. It will be a rough draft that the designers will modify after hearing suggestions from residents, said Wilbur Woods, a director at the planning department. 
Already, it seems, some people in Staten Island are impatient for their park. Already, there are new housing developments along the landfill's edge. Homeowners, said Phillip Gleason, director of landfill engineering at the Department of Sanitation, do not want to wait decades for their real estate values to rise. 
"Any community that wants a park, wants a park," he said. "They say: 'My grandkids will be the first to see it.' They say they want it sooner." Advice to Staten Islanders: keep waiting. It may take another 55 years before the park is completed. 
The plans for the 2,200-acre Fresh Kills park are ambitious. It will have "everything you could think of," Mr. Woods said. "Large open green space, concert arenas, sports fields, wetlands, wildlife habitats, boating."
There are two major obstacles to the grand plans: money and the lengthy and technically complicated conversion of a landfill that is three times the size of Central Park into safe, open land. Estimates of the cost range from many hundreds of millions of dollars to $1 billion. Just covering the landfill with a thick plastic liner and 18 inches of specially formulated soil and planting it with native grasses cost millions of dollars. There are still 600 or 700 acres of landfill -- currently covered with a temporary layer of dirt -- that must be covered, at a cost of about $2 million, Mr. Gleason said.
Mr. Gleason said it would take at least 30 years for the garbage to decompose completely and the four trash mountains, which are 150 to 200 feet tall, to settle. Large sections of the park can be built before that, but the construction cannot be finished until the methane and polluted water dissipate, he said.
That kind of talk creates skepticism about the whole venture. Jogging over garbage peaks? Picnicking 18 inches above millions of tons of decaying fruit peels and torn tires? 
Michael Heinz, who has lived all his life in Staten Island, said: "I'm not one of those people who relish the idea of people lying on grass on top of toxic chemicals. I wouldn't bring my kids there."
Mr. Gleason said he knew the feelings well. "Fresh Kills is stigmatized, and that's a real issue," he said. "We have to deal with it. How? Education, education, education."
Actually, now that the garbage trucks are gone, the landfill, in the words of one designer, "has a strange and quiet beauty." There are rolling, grassy meadows, and from the top of the garbage mountains, there is a lovely view of Arthur Kill and Fresh Kills Creek. It feels spacious and quiet, and the sky seems unusually open and vast, without a high-rise in sight. It does not smell of garbage. 
"The scale is so big and the land is so open," said James Corner, a finalist in the design competition. There is space, he said, for a "very exciting landscape that would be diverse ecologically and culturally, with fields, meadows, prairies, swamp forests, fresh and salt marshes." 
Fresh Kills is more than big enough for natural habitat and structures for sports and the arts to coexist comfortably. 
The three plans all include the usual park features: ball fields, nature walks, bike paths, wildlife sanctuaries, as well as roads to relieve traffic on nearby highways. They all have plans for a memorial to be built on the 10-acre site where debris from ground zero was unloaded. In one design, it is a grove with a flowering tree for each victim. In another, it is a grassy meadow with a graded dirt sculpture. 
Mr. Corner, who is based in Philadelphia, said he wanted to build a huge nature reserve. Staten Island was once unusually diverse biologically, he said, adding, "I want to bring the diverse range of habitats and social amenities to an otherwise inert landscape." He is also planning art galleries, sculpture gardens and complexes for sports and the arts. 
Mark Rios, a finalist from Los Angeles, would have a series of "energy farms" with alternative energy sources, like wind turbines and solar canopies. His design includes a "garbology museum" on the history and archaeology of trash, as well as excavations and artifact exhibits from the landfill. 
James McAslan, a London-based designer and the third finalist, wants to have centers for the study of bird migration, energy and recycling and native plants. He also plans a series of domes enclosing various global climates, like tropical, sub-Arctic and temperate.
The technical obstacles to building any kind of park are "very, very difficult," Mr. Corner said. The release of methane and polluted water will go on for decades, as the trash mountains settle. One mound, shut in 1996, has shrunk by 15 feet and is expected to shrink 15 more. 
Pipes and pumps have been installed to channel the methane to power companies for sale as heating gas. The Sanitation Department makes about $1 million a year on gas sales, Mr. Gleason said. The polluted water is collected in pipes at the bottom of the garbage mounds to be collected at a plant and filtered. 
To prevent pollution and bad smells, the plastic liner must not be torn, he said. It will require great care to avoid damaging it during construction and planting, and at least three more feet of soil must be spread for trees to thrive, Mr. Gleason said. 
Fresh Kills park will be built in sections, Mr. Gleason said. The first area of about 10 acres may open as early as 2007. Other sections will be built gradually over the years. Major construction, however, is unlikely to begin before 2030 or so. Someday, he said, the great Fresh Kills landfill will become just another curious piece of city lore. 
"Fresh Kills will have a very long history," he said. "What people remember about it in the past is the worst. They'll see that the Fresh Kills of the present and the future is much, much better."

HEADLINE: BLOCKS; 
Unusual Planning Duel Over Kennedy Terminal

BYLINE:  By David W. Dunlap 

 BODY:
THE 40th anniversary of Eero Saarinen's breathtaking T.W.A. Flight Center at Kennedy International Airport was marked this year in an unusual way. No cake. No candles. Just lights out. The terminal was shut down.
 Whether it ever reopens -- and how it will be used if it does -- is at stake in a planning duel with a curious twist. Airport authorities say the sinuous, sculptural building might find new life as a restaurant, conference center or museum. Preservationists say it should stay an airline terminal. 
 In fact, the Municipal Art Society is proposing the addition of new concourses and gates to the landmark Saarinen structure, an expansion that would require the demolition of the former National Airlines Sundrome nearby, a less celebrated but still distinguished building designed by I. M. Pei.
"This preserves Saarinen's ideas of entry and vista," said Frank E. Sanchis III, executive director of the society, speaking of a conceptual plan prepared by H3 Architecture. "The integrity of his vision is maintained."
Theo Prudon, the president of Docomomo U.S., which concerns itself with the conservation of modern architecture, said, "For a building like this to be viable -- viable both philosophically and, frankly, economically -- it has to have an airline use."
When preservationists urge that a building's intent and function be safeguarded along with its physical shell, and when some of them are prepared to trade a Pei for a Saarinen, one can safely say that a corner has been turned. Even in a building where you'd be hard pressed to find a corner.
Unlike the battle over Pennsylvania Station, which reached a climax in 1962 just as the T.W.A. Flight Center opened, there is no proposal on the table to demolish the structure, at least not the main building, now designated Terminal 5, with its spread-eagle concrete roof and tubular corridors.
"We remain committed to protecting Terminal 5," said Pasquale DiFulco, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, "and enhancing its role as an airport centerpiece."
But the authority is also adamant that a terminal designed in an era of Constellations and built at the dawn of the 707 jetliner is "inadequate to meet passenger, baggage and security standards required for contemporary aviation operations."
No airline has stepped forward to request the terminal since American Airlines abandoned it in January, Mr. DiFulco said. (Trans World Airlines ended operations there in October 2001 after it was acquired by American.)
The future outlined by the authority involves an enormous new C-shaped terminal around the Saarinen building, for the use of several airlines, JetBlue Airways among them. The number of gates would grow to 51 from the current 37.
The Saarinen building would be rehabilitated. But it would also be cut off, physically and visually, from the aircraft and view of the taxiways and runways. The two remote gate areas, one of which is covered by the city's landmark designation, would be demolished. The connector tubes would then join the new terminal to the Saarinen building.
Exactly how the Saarinen building would be adapted has yet to be determined. The Port Authority plans to issue a request for proposals in the coming months.
It must also demonstrate to the Federal Aviation Administration that there are no prudent, feasible alternatives to its redevelopment plan, under a federal law known as Section 4(f) requiring that transportation projects do not adversely affect historic sites.
This has given the Municipal Art Society some leverage in the process. It submitted its counterproposal to the F.A.A. last month. "We think it's feasible and prudent," said Vicki Weiner, director of historic preservation at the society.
Drawn up by Hal Hayes of H3 and four airport planners, the plan would preserve the remote gate areas, from which new concourses would telescope. It would append a large new structure to one end of the Saarinen building, with another concourse. All told, it would create 52 gates.
LIKE the Port Authority plan, it would require the demolition of the former Sundrome, now Terminal 6, which is used by JetBlue. The authority has only recently received the Municipal Art Society plan and is not yet prepared to respond publicly, Mr. DiFulco said.
While many landmarks no longer serve their original purpose, there is something satisfying about those that do, from City Hall to Grand Central Terminal.
Grand Central may be an instructive analogy to the T.W.A. Flight Center. After all, it is no longer the "Gateway to a Continent" but a suburban commuter rail station. That does not make it any less imposing or vital.
No amount of nostalgia will bring back the days of dressing up for air travel and eating in-flight meals with silverware. But travelers could still revel in Saarinen's soaring spaces. The question is, where would they go from there?

HEADLINE: Latest Data on the Economy Tends to Be Largely Upbeat 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
Economic reports released today offered some upbeat information about manufacturing, the economy and consumer spending. But the reports were tempered by some less-optimistic outlooks.
 Consumer confidence rebounded in November from a nine-year low, while orders for durable goods rose in October for the first time since July and initial jobless claims fell last week to their lowest level in 21 months, according to reports released today. 
 The Commerce Department said that orders for durable goods -- manufactured items intended to last three years or more -- rose a higher-than-expected 2.8 percent in October, helped by strong demand for machinery and a 65.2 percent surge for communications equipment. 
That rise came after a revised drop of 4.6 percent in September.
"I think you are seeing an improvement in the economy; durable goods orders are improving and we are probably in an environment of strengthening capital spending," said Rick Egleton, deputy chief economist at the BMO Financial Group in Toronto.
Orders for computers and electronic products posted their largest increase in a year, climbing 6.2 percent, with communications equipment surging at the fastest pace since January 1997. Nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, seen as a proxy for capital spending by businesses, rose 5.3 percent after a sharp fall in September. Orders excluding military goods rose 3.8 percent, while orders excluding those for transportation climbed 2.4 percent.
Another report released today offered more good news for the manufacturing sector. The National Association of Purchasing Management's Midwest business activity index rose to 54.3 in November, from 45.9 in October. A reading above 50 indicates growth. 
"What it says is that the worst is behind us in terms of the soft spot that was a concern to the Fed," said Dana Johnson, senior managing director and head of research at Banc One Capital Markets.
But a Federal Reserve report offered a less optimistic picture for manufacturing, saying the sector "remained soft" in most areas. 
"Economic activity grew slowly, on balance, in late October and early November," the Fed said in its so-called beige book report, an anecdotal survey of economic conditions. The economy inched ahead in the survey period as consumers spent less on cars and manufacturers struggled, the Fed said.
In the labor market, positive signals were tempered by the fact that seasonal factors may have been at play. The Labor Department said that initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits fell by 17,000, to 364,000, in the week ended Nov. 23. That was down from a revised 381,000 the previous week, beating expectations.
The department cautioned that the claims numbers were more volatile during November and December. Still, many economists took heart at the recent down trend. 
"The Labor Department noted holidays might have played a role in the decline," said Gerald Cohen, senior economist at Merrill Lynch. "Still, the downward trend in claims suggests the labor market is stabilizing." 
In another report, the Commerce Department said that personal spending outpaced income growth for the first time since the summer, rising 0.4 percent after a 0.4 percent drop in September. 
Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, so such spending is crucial to the economic recovery and has played a big role in keeping it going this year. 
The University of Michigan reported that its November consumer sentiment index jumped to 84.2, from 80.6, another indication that consumers remained upbeat.
The number fell slightly short of expectations but broke a five-month run of declines as the recent turnaround in the stock market and a cut in interest rates earlier this month by the Fed lifted consumer spirits. 
The expectations index, which tracks attitudes about the 12 months ahead, measured 78.5, off slightly from 79.2 in the preliminary November reading, but up sharply from 73.1 in the final October reading.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "Economy Sluggish but Expected to Pick Up Next Year"A roundup of regional economic conditions in recent months for the Federal Reserve Board's 12 districts, according to the beige book report issued by the Fed yesterday. San Francisco (Includes Alaska and Hawaii) -- The economy was sluggish. Consumer spending softened, particularly for big-ticket items like automobiles, furniture and consumer products. Minneapolis -- Consumer spending was weak, and mining and commercial construction slowed. Inflation was tame. Chicago -- Consumer spending and manufacturing weakened. Home sales were strong. St. Louis -- Economic conditions were mixed, with manufacturing showing increased closings, layoffs and consolidations. Kansas City, Mo. -- Signs of improvement were reported. Retail sales rose somewhat and manufacturing stabilized. Job cuts were higher. Dallas -- Businesses indicated that uncertainty was affecting their decisions, and many do not expect a pickup in the economy until next year. Cleveland -- Mixed signals were reported. Most expect the economy to improve no later than the second quarter of 2003. Boston -- The regional economy remained slow. Some retailers were more optimistic than in the previous report. New York -- Improvements were reported in labor markets, retail sales and manufacturing. Real estate continued to cool. Philadelphia -- The outlook was positive, but there was a general feeling that economic growth was fragile and likely to remain so. Richmond, Va. -- Weaknesses persisted in manufacturing and demand for services cooled. Inflation remained modest. Atlanta -- Business remained sluggish, highlighted by lackluster retail sales and weaker auto sales. The housing market was strong. Map of the United States highlights the locations listed above.

HEADLINE: Haitian Opposition Vows New Protests to Force Aristide to Resign 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
Opponents stepped up the pressure on President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti today, saying they planned to hold continuous nationwide protests until he resigned.
 As thousands of students marched in the northern city of Cap Haitien, one of Aristide's major political foes, Evans Paul, the former mayor of Port-au-Prince, announced in the capital that opposition parties would begin a new round of large demonstrations on Thursday. 
 "We must combat and prevent the establishment of an Aristide dictatorship in Haiti," said Mr. Paul, secretary general of the Konfederasyon Inite Demokratik party, which is associated with the opposition coalition Democratic Convergence. "We will continue with our peaceful national mobilization until we free the country from Lavalas control." 
Mr. Aristide, whose Lavalas Family party controls Parliament, has faced increasingly violent demonstrations in the past two weeks over Haiti's faltering economy and perceptions that his government is interfering with the school system.
His supporters have mounted large and noisy counterdemonstrations.
The protest today in Cap Haitien, Haiti's second-largest city, echoed one on Nov. 17 in which an estimated 10,000 people took part, the private Radio Vision 2000 reported.
Protests were also reported in the provincial cities of Petit-Goave and Gonaives, where eight people have been shot in political violence since Monday.
On Tuesday, unidentified gunmen in Gonaives fired on a marked car belonging to the Organization of American States, local news media said. No one was reported injured.
The organization is trying to broker a political truce in Haiti, and this week it criticized Mr. Aristide's government for its handling of the recent demonstrations.
"The acts are provocations by the opposition," said Mario Dupuy, secretary of state for communications. "We are committed to tracking down those responsible for violence."
A former Roman Catholic priest who rallied Haiti's poor masses to overthrow a 30-year dictatorship in the mid-1980's, Mr. Aristide has been hamstrung since he took office in February 2001 by a dispute with Democratic Convergence over contested May 2000 legislative elections.
The deadlock has stalled over $500 million in desperately needed aid to eight million people in Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas.
Haiti's currency, the gourde, has lost 40 percent of its value, and inflation is up 16 percent in the last year.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Some may shrug off 5.7 percent unemployment, but it pinches hard at the bottom of the economic ladder.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and the journal Indicators, and he also teaches at Cooper Union. His book "Why Economies Grow" was recently published by Basic Books. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
THERE seems to be a notion around that an economy with unemployment at the current rate of 5.7 percent is not doing too badly at all. At least that's how some members of Congress justified their refusal on Friday to extend unemployment benefits, which will soon expire for nearly a million workers.
 After all, many economists asserted only a few years ago that an unemployment rate around 6 percent is about the best the economy could do. 
 But most of those economists are still trying to wipe the egg off their faces. If the 1990's taught us anything at all, it is that the American economy can now do better. The unemployment rate fell consistently from 6 percent in 1994 to a low of around 4 percent for all of 2001, with little worry about inflation. 
And low unemployment -- the nation had not experienced sustained unemployment at the 2000 level since the 1960's -- showed us all just how much better the economy can perform than even the most optimistic had come to believe.
As unemployment fell through the 1990's, the number of unemployed Americans fell by an impressive five million workers. In addition, millions of people who lost jobs found them more quickly, far fewer workers had to settle for part-time jobs, and many more people started to look for work again after sitting on the sidelines during the slow economic growth of previous years.
Now the economy has deteriorated again. How does an economy with an unemployment rate around 6 percent compare with one with an unemployment rate around 4 percent? To get a sense of the differences, Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, compared the conditions of the labor markets in the first nine months of 2002, when the unemployment rate averaged 5.7 percent, with the first nine months of 2000, when it averaged 4 percent. 
About 2.5 million more workers are unemployed now than in 2000. That's bad enough. But the unemployment rate for African-Americans has risen about 60 percent faster than for all workers. Some 400,000 more are now out of work than were out of work in 2000, a two-year rise of 30 percent.
Moreover, after workers have lost their jobs, they have had more trouble finding new ones. The proportion of those who have been out of work for more than 27 weeks is way up. That is why extending unemployment benefits is so important. Now, about 800,000 more workers have been out of work for six months or longer, compared with the number in 2000.
In addition, the number of part-time workers who would like full-time work has risen by one million. And the increase in the labor force has slowed markedly because many more people have stopped looking for jobs. They do not show up in the unemployment data. In the recessions of the early 1980's and 1990's, the labor force grew far more rapidly, pushing up the unemployment rate. 
Such a snapshot does not nearly tell the whole story, however. The biggest benefit from rapid growth coupled with low unemployment rates may well have been the first significant increases in wages and family incomes since the 1960's. Over all, family incomes, for example, rose far more rapidly from 1996 to 2000 than they did from 1991 to 1996 or even from 1984 to 1989 -- the last five years of the fairly rapid expansion under Ronald Reagan. In particular, incomes for lower-income families rose as rapidly as for other income groups for the first time since the 1970's. In other words, income inequality stopped widening at last.
Family incomes at the 20th percentile -- low-income families who earned more than 20 percent but less than 80 percent of all families -- began to rise as rapidly as family incomes for those in the 80th percentile in the mid-1990's. In fact, incomes rose at about the same pace for all income levels in these years.
By contrast, in the early 1990's, when the unemployment rate averaged around 6.5 percent and economic growth was sluggish, family incomes grew much more slowly at all levels -- about half as fast. But incomes for lower-end families grew the most slowly. 
Those at the 20th percentile grew by a scant 0.5 percent a year from 1991 to 1996, less than one-fourth their rate of growth in the late 1990's. These families were earning only a few hundred dollars more after five years. Families at the median saw their incomes rise about twice as fast as low-income families. They were earning $1,200 a year more in 1996 than in 1991. Family incomes in the 80th percentile rose still faster. They were earning $5,000 more in 1996. 
Comparisons with the 1980's are even more interesting because growth was fairly rapid in these years, and the unemployment rate fell sharply. Again, family incomes rose for all levels from 1984 to 1989. But with unemployment rates still well above 5 percent, incomes grew most slowly for low-income families. And income inequality widened significantly over these years. 
For all the claims that educational differences and international trade were the main causes of income inequality in America, the experience of the 1990's increasingly suggests that slow growth and high unemployment were more decisive. As labor markets tightened in the late 1990's, even low- and middle-income workers seemed to regain some bargaining power at last. Mr. Bernstein and Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research find an inverse statistical correlation between unemployment rates and wage rates for low-end workers. 
With the recession that began two years ago, family incomes again fell across the board. But it's no surprise that they fell most rapidly for those in the bottom 20 or 30 percent. An unemployment rate of 6 percent, or even 5 percent, is just not good enough.

HEADLINE: Bush Plan Gives More Discretion To Forest Managers on Logging 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
The Bush administration proposed today to give managers of the 155 national forests more discretion to approve logging and commercial activities with less evaluation of potential damage to the environment.
 The proposal would thoroughly rewrite rules issued by President Bill Clinton in November 2000. 
 Under the Clinton-administration rules, the government must systematically assess the likely effects on the environment whenever it revises a 15-year plan for management of a national forest. Under the proposal issued today by the Forest Service, the preparation of the assessments, known as environmental impact statements, would be left to the discretion of the forest manager. 
The Clinton rules require the government to protect fish and wildlife in national forests so the species do not become threatened or endangered. One of the two major options in today's proposal says that forest management plans "should provide" such protections but does not require them. The other option says the government will identify steps needed to conserve fish and wildlife but does not require officials to take them. 
In announcing the new proposal today, the Forest Service said the Clinton administration rules were far too prescriptive and costly. The agency said the Clinton rules included "unnecessarily detailed procedural requirements for scientific peer reviews" and monitoring of individual species in the national forests.
Sally Collins, chief operating officer of the Forest Service, a unit of the Agriculture Department, said, "The proposed rule is designed to more effectively involve the public and to better harmonize the environmental, social and economic benefits of America's greatest natural resource, our forests and grasslands."
Environmentalists and Democrats in Congress denounced the proposal as a radical departure from rules and policies that have protected forests for more than two decades. They asserted that the administration had held back the proposal until after Election Day and the adjournment of Congress because it knew the changes would be unpopular.
The public will have 90 days to comment on the proposal. After considering the comments, the administration intends to issue final rules with the force of law.
The government has issued three sets of rules for managing the national forests, in 1979, 1982 and 2000. Environmentalists contend that today's proposal would provide less protection to forests and wildlife than the 1982 rules, issued by President Ronald Reagan. The Clinton rules took effect on Nov. 9, 2000, but the Bush administration put them on hold five months later.
Critics said the Bush administration was, for the second time in a week, siding with business interests on an environmental issue. Last week the administration announced that it was loosening air pollution rules that apply to industrial sites, including oil refineries.
Fifteen Democratic members of Congress -- eight senators and seven House members -- sent a letter to the administration today saying that the proposal would eliminate many protections for fish and wildlife. Such protections, they said, are essential because national forests are home to 25 percent of the species at risk of extinction in the United States.
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, House Democratic leader in the new Congress, is among those who signed the letter.
The American Forest and Paper Association, a trade group for the forest products industry, welcomed the changes, saying they would allow forest managers to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires.
"The proposal will restore common sense to the forest management process," said Michael Klein, a spokesman for the association. "And I don't think it will necessarily mean more tree removal." 
But Rodger Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of Wildlife, said: "The proposal is a brazen attempt to increase logging and help the timber industry. It closely follows the wish list of the American Forest and Paper Association."
Mr. Schlickeisen said the proposal had been shaped by Mark Rey, the under secretary of agriculture for natural resources and environment. From 1992 to 1994, Mr. Rey was a vice president of the American Forest and Paper Association, and from 1976 to 1984, he worked for a predecessor organization.
Heidi Valetkevitch, a Forest Service spokeswoman, said Mr. Rey was "in the chain of command" but the plan had been devised mainly by Ms. Collins and Dale N. Bosworth, chief of the Forest Service.
Mr. Bosworth has said that his highest priority is to end "analysis paralysis." By that, he said, "I mean the difficult, costly, confusing and seemingly endless processes" that generate studies, administrative appeals and litigation without tangible benefit to forest lands.
Federal officials said the proposal would reduce the cost of forest planning by 30 percent and could cut the time required to develop a forest plan to two years, from the current six or seven years.
The proposal applies to 192 million acres of public lands in 155 national forests and 20 grasslands in 44 states. The forests include Tongass, in Alaska, with snow-capped mountains and streams filled with salmon; the Sequoia forest in California, where ancient trees tower over visitors; Gallatin, in Montana, one of the last refuges for grizzly bears and wolves in the lower 48 states; and the White Mountain National Forest, in New Hampshire and Maine, which has 1,200 miles of hiking trails.
For each national forest, the government prepares a formal plan, similar to a zoning ordinance. The plan identifies areas suitable for recreation, grazing and timber harvesting and specifies what must be done to protect rare species, prevent floods and reduce wildfire hazards. 
Under the rules issued by the Clinton administration, the government must assess the effects on the environment whenever it revises a forest plan. The proposed rules would not require such assessments.
Ms. Valetkevitch of the Forest Service said: "Under the proposed rule, an environmental impact statement will not always be required when revising a forest plan. We are giving more discretion to the forest manager in deciding whether an impact statement is warranted. The manager can look at his forest or grassland and decide what's best."

HEADLINE: For the U.S., Neighborly Rancor, North and South 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
When a senior aide to Prime Minister Jean Chretien called President Bush a "moron" in a recent private conversation overheard by a reporter, she might have been voicing the frustrations of Canadians who tend to see their dominant southern neighbor as a place where profits come before health care and guns before safety. 
 Those frustrations appeared to bubble over this week with what might otherwise have been a childish indiscretion by the aide, Mr. Chretien's communications director, Francoise Ducros, who resigned on Tuesday. 
 Her remark opened the door to a flurry of journalistic soul-searching about the state of Canada's most important foreign relationship -- one that especially concerns most Canadians who live near the American border and depend on trade with the United States. 
The two countries are at loggerheads over a series of issues ranging from American tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber to American complaints about Canadian softness on drugs, especially marijuana, to Canada's willingness to trade and have normal relations with Cuba.
"Canadians feel at the moment that the United States is bullying Canada on a number of minor economic issues," said John Ferris, a history professor at the University of Calgary. Yet, saying the current strain was not unusual, he added, "I can't remember a single American president in my lifetime who educated Canadians didn't think was a bumpkin." 
By and large, beneath the friction, he said, Canadians tend to "see Americans as friends and believe the norm in our relationship should be good relations."
The stresses are a constant, just as sparks are a habitual ingredient in relations between the United States and its other neighbor, Mexico.
Both Mexicans and Canadians are constantly reminded that the United States has enormous power over their economies by virtue of its size and wealth, and neither country likes feeling dependent. Just as Mexicans are offended by the way their compatriots are sometimes treated in the United States, Canadians do not like to be taken for granted as a lightweight ally when Washington decides on a major foreign policy initiative.
Canadians were miffed immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks when Mr. Bush listed several allies who had pledged support but did not mention Canada after this country sheltered thousands of American travelers who could not fly home that day.
When Canada sent troops to Afghanistan and an American fighter jet dropped a bomb on Canadian troops in April by mistake, killing four, Canadians were outraged that it took Mr. Bush two days to offer a public apology.
More recently, Canadian officials have criticized American treatment at the border of some Canadian citizens born in in the Middle East.
The frictions that go along with a tightening border, the longest demilitarized frontier in the world, were underscored last month when a Canadian was arrested and jailed for filling up at a gasoline station a few yards inside the Maine border without first registering with United States Customs. He was charged with carrying a shotgun in his trunk.
Much has also been made in the Canadian media about how Mr. Bush has never invited Mr. Chretien to his Texas ranch. The two leaders have a frosty personal relationship, especially compared with the easy rapport Mr. Chretien had with President Clinton, who shared his passion for golf and quick-witted banter.
Now Mr. Chretien has reportedly been nicknamed "Dino," for dinosaur, by some in the White House.
So how bad are relations between the United States and its neighbors? They could be better, but they are not so bad when compared with the past.
Canadian troops fought in combat under American commanders in Afghanistan for the first time since the Korean War, and Canada has stated it would be willing to contribute troops for an invasion of Iraq as long as it is approved by the United Nations. American and Canadian law enforcement and intelligence agencies are working closer since the Sept. 11 attacks than they have in many years, officials here say.
"The relationship between Canada and the United States is greater than a slip of the tongue," said Paul Frazer, a former Canadian ambassador to Czechoslovakia who worked in the Canadian Embassy in Washington between 1994 and 2000.
Still, the Ducros comment is a reminder of the historical frictions, which were particularly numerous during the cold war. Canada was slow to back President Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. Relations frayed during the Vietnam War, when Canada opposed United States policy and welcomed draft evaders with open arms.
Perhaps relations between the United States and its two neighbors seem so fractious now because there were rising expectations in recent years that they had improved to a new harmony.
Former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, a conservative, hit it off famously with President Reagan and the first President Bush, and agreed to the Nafta free trade agreement. That agreement also brought the United States-Mexican relationship to new heights, and the election of President Vicente Fox two years ago was supposed to augur firmer ties and better treatment for the three million to four million Mexicans who live illegally north of the border.
Then came Sept. 11, and Mexico as well as Canada became policy issues destined for the back burner. As Secretary of State Colin L. Powell left Mexico after a two-day visit Tuesday that accomplished little except gain a joint communique calling on Saddam Hussein to disarm, the Mexican leftist newspaper La Jornada commented in an editorial, "The representatives of our country ceded everything and got nothing in return."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE ALLIES; 
U.S. Is Pressing For Turks' Help In Move on Iraq

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is mounting a major effort to enlist the support of the new Islamic government of Turkey for a northern front if there is a war with Iraq, senior officials said today.
 As part of that effort, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz plans to leave on Sunday for a round of consultations in Ankara, Brussels and London. Turkey is his most important stop. 
 Bush administration officials say that the United States could defeat Iraq without Turkey's support. But they argue that an American military campaign would be more decisive and could be executed more quickly if Iraq's military had to fight on several fronts. 
They also say that the Pentagon needs to dispel uncertainty over Turkey's role in a potential conflict. There have been, in effect, two military plans by the United States: one that assumes extensive Turkish cooperation in a military campaign to dislodge Saddam Hussein's government and one that does not. Senior American officials said Washington was running out of time to settle its northern front strategy because they considered it unlikely that the Iraqi government would comply with United Nations inspections. 
American officials did not say precisely what role they would like Turkey to play in a conflict. Turkey has air bases that the United States would like to use to mount bombing attacks. It also has a large army. 
Asked if the United States wanted Turkish ground forces to participate in an attack, a senior administration official said Washington believed it would be advantageous to confront Iraq with as potent a military threat from the north as possible.
Mr. Wolfowitz's trip is the first of a series of high-level visits that are intended to elicit international support for the Bush administration's tough policy on Iraq. Some of these trips, like Mr. Wolfowitz's, are intended to form a military coalition. Others are intended to secure political support from nations like China that do not plan to join the fray but whose views are important. 
The trips will be carried out during a crucial period. On Dec. 8, Iraq is required to submit an account of its programs to develop chemical, biological and nuclear arms and the missiles that might carry them. There are likely to be different interpretations of whether the declaration is adequate, and the United States wants to maintain a tough stand.
Besides the Wolfowitz trip, visits will be made to other countries in Europe, Asia and the Middle East by Richard L. Armitage, the deputy secretary of state; Stephen J. Hadley, the deputy national security adviser to President Bush; and Douglas J. Feith, the under secretary of defense for policy. Marc Grossman, the under secretary of state for political affairs, will accompany Mr. Wolfowitz on his trip and then proceed with his own itinerary.
Mr. Wolfowitz's first stop will be Brussels, where he will meet with NATO ambassadors. The Bush administration would like NATO members to join in Mr. Bush's coalition of nations that are able and willing to confront Iraq. 
It also wants NATO to reaffirm its intention to support Turkey, which is a member of the military alliance, in the event of a war with Iraq. Article V of the NATO Charter stipulates that an attack on one member is to be considered an attack on all. Washington would like this provision to be invoked if there is a war with Iraq.
Mr. Wolfowitz will also visit London, which is the staunchest of the American allies on Iraq. The British are expected to contribute military forces for an invasion of Iraq.
But Turkey is the critical stop. The Bush administration has carried out extensive consultations with Turkey about a potential confrontation with Iraq. Vice President Dick Cheney visited Ankara in the spring, but the election victory by the Justice and Development Party, whose leadership has strong Islamic views, has made it necessary for the Bush administration to start from scratch. (Before its victory, the party indicated that it would leave any decision on Iraq to Turkey's military.)
Bush administration officials are using several arguments to try to persuade the Turks to support and participate in an offensive. First, they argue that the war will be over more quickly and as a result, there will be less economic disruption if Turkey joins in the attack. Many neighboring states are willing to support an offensive if it is relatively brief and decisive and if civilian casualties are low. What they fear is a long, drawn-out conflict. 
Washington is also arguing that the threat of military force will encourage Mr. Hussein to comply with the demands of United Nations weapons inspectors, though some senior Bush administration officials privately believe that Iraqi compliance is highly unlikely. 
Washington is offering tangible benefits to Turkey. The Bush administration has indicated that it is prepared to give Turkey economic aid to compensate it for any losses it might sustain as a result of a Iraq war. Just how much is a matter of negotiation. 
More generally, Washington argues that Turkey is likely to benefit economically if a new government is installed in Iraq and trade with Iraq expanded. Washington has also been backing Turkey's efforts to join the European Union. 
The European Union is holding a meeting in Copenhagen on Dec. 12 to discuss Turkey's potential membership. Mr. Bush recently called Denmark's prime minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, to support Turkey's efforts to join the European Union. The Bush administration has also made it clear that it will not support a separate Kurdish state in northern Iraq, a concern for Turkey, which has its own restive Kurdish minority. 
A senior administration official said he thought Washington would be able to satisfy Turkey's concerns. Still, the Turkish leadership has been contending with an array of issues, including its bid to join the European Union and a plan that Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations has proposed to resolve the dispute over Cyprus, which Turkey has partly occupied since 1974. 
During the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the United States carried out airstrikes from air bases in Turkey. Search-and-rescue teams were also based there. 
Since the end of the war, American and British warplanes have used air bases in Turkey to patrol the no-flight zone in northern Iraq. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 30, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about efforts by the United States to enlist Turkey's support for possible military action against Iraq described the new government there incorrectly. It is a coalition whose largest member, the Justice and Development Party, has Islamist roots. It is not an Islamic government.

 The chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, said that Sir Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, would be succeeded by Mervyn King, left, his deputy, when he retires in June. The announcement ended speculation over the position -- Britain's equivalent to chairman of the United States Federal Reserve. 
Apart from Mr. King, Howard Davies, the chairman of the watchdog Financial Services Authority, and Andrew Crockett, former head of the Bank for International Settlements, had been believed to be in the running. Mr. Brown also announced plans to double net borrowing, to $31 billion in this fiscal year, and he reduced his forecast for British economic growth this year to 1.6 percent, from an earlier range of 2 percent to 2.5 percent.

Allergy Drug Is Approved For Sale Over the Counter
Regulators approved the nation's top-selling allergy drug, Claritin, as an over-the-counter medicine, a decision that will bring substantial savings for the uninsured. Schering-Plough, the maker of Claritin, said that the nonprescription drug would be available in mid-December.
 With prescription costs rising, insurers are pressing regulators to make more brand name drugs available over the counter. WellPoint, the insurer that initiated the reappraisal of Claritin, has also asked regulators to make Clarinex, Schering-Plough's newest allergy drug, available over the counter. Page A1.

 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg signed into law yesterday two bills that affect workers. 
The first, known as the living wage bill, requires certain city contractors and subcontractors to pay their employees at least $8.10 an hour with health coverage, or $9.60 an hour without coverage. Over four years, those minimums, which will cover day care, home care and cerebral palsy workers employed by companies with city contracts, will rise by $1.90 an hour and then increase in line with inflation. The second law provides building-service workers with temporary protection from loss of employment when the building that employs them is sold or transferred to another business entity. The law does not affect city-owned buildings. Diane Cardwell (NYT)

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "A VERY PRIVATE COLLECTION: JANICE H. LEVIN'S IMPRESSIONIST PICTURES," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Feb. 9). Quiet acquisitors who never went public with their holdings, the late Janice and Philip Levin had assembled a strong if not venturesome collection of Impressionist and other works, including Bonnard, Cassatt, Corot, Derain, Giacometti, Monet, Modigliani, Morisot, Picasso, Pissarro, Toulouse-Lautrec and Vuillard. Among the gems are Monet's celebrations of nature "Artist's Garden at Argenteuil" from 1873 and his "On the Cliff at Pourville, Clear Weather"; Degas's acutely observed "A la Bourse (Portraits in the Stock Exchange)"; and Derain's "Plate of Peaches," a tiny but firmly structured composition meant as a homage to Cezanne. As with every collection, there are weaknesses, including a cliched Renoir, "Gondola in Venice." But collections are all about taste, and this is one where it was firmly exercised. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $7, students and 65+ (Grace Glueck).

* "THE ADVENTURES OF HAMZA," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718 638-5000 (through Jan. 26). If Great Books were judged great by size and illustrations alone, the "Hamzanama," or "Story of Hamza," made for the Mughal emperor Akbar in 16th-century India would be one of the greatest of all. It was originally more the 1,200 pages long. Each page was two feet tall. The paintings, which tell of the encounters of the mythical warrior-prince named Hamza with demons, dragons and giants, are fantastic. The book exists only as fragments now, but about 200 of the finest surviving pages have been brought together from around the world for this exhibition. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3, students and 62+ (Holland Cotter).

"AN AMERICAN LEGACY, A GIFT TO NEW YORK," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Jan. 26). The Whitney trustees pooled their pennies, acquired $200 million worth of postwar American art and gave it all to the museum as a gift. The 87 works, dating from the 1940's through the 1990's, enhance and subtly reshape the museum's account of American modernism. And they are all temporarily on view in this showcase, which ranges from classic Abstract Expressionist painting (Kline, Pollock, Still) to early Pop (pre-silkscreen Warhol), with lots and lots of Jasper Johns. Most of of the choices are predictably canonical; the show perks up with odd-duck contributions by Jay DeFeo and Lucas Samaras. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8, students and 62+ (Cotter).

* "DRAWING NOW: EIGHT PROPOSITIONS," Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Jan. 6). This generous sampling of work by 26 young artists provides a sweeping, even opulent view of drawing at the threshold of the 21st century. The variety of techniques and materials, the mix of large-scale feats of draftsmanship with clusters of framed works, the breadth of sources (from American quilt patterns to Japanese anime to 19th-century illustration) and the range of narrative ambition create an exhilarating sense of possibility. Some of the artists illustrate rather than fully embody the curators' categories, and there is an excess of fashionable, even overexposed artists from a handful of hot galleries. Nonetheless, "Drawing Now" is required viewing for anyone remotely interested in today's art. It sets a standard for future shows of its kind. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m; until 7:45 p.m. on Fridays. Admission: $12; $8.50, students and 65+ (Roberta Smith).

* "CARROLL DUNHAM: PAINTINGS," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Feb. 2). Also, "Carroll Dunham: Drawings, 1985-2002," Nolan/Eckman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 925-6190 (through Dec. 20). Two midcareer surveys of Mr. Dunham trace his arc across two decades from psychedelic abstraction toward a figuration of escalated nuttiness and technical panache. He is squarely at the heart of the modern cartoon aesthetic; its pathos may turn out to be the signature of our age. In his case, abject subject matter and woolly psychodrama are tempered by low-key amiability. When his works fail, they fail in the direction of too-easy decoration and cheerful psychedelia. Otherwise, they succeed on the bases of sly humor, self-mockery and a kind of sneaky, unpretentious charm. There is no preaching or political doctrine. His paintings emerge from the act of painting; they are Process Art of a peculiar kind and they deliver us into a funny-sad realm, conjured up to purge a few ghosts, maybe, and to provide us with pleasure. That, and the sense of wit to recognize our essential folly, is plenty. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students, artists and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* "GENESIS: IDEAS OF ORIGIN IN AFRICAN SCULPTURE," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through April 13). This splendid show, installed in the Michael C. Rockefeller Wing, examines African myths about the creation of the world, the foundations of kingship and the formation of the family as told in the art of more than a dozen sub-Saharan cultures. The images range from naturalistic figures to fantastic animals and culminate in a coup de theatre display of some 40 Bamana headdresses, many of the classic Ci Ware type. The dynamic is one of ethical persuasion, physical and psychological healing and a holistic connection to the world through objects of irrepressible energy and beauty. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

* "KAZARI: DECORATION AND DISPLAY IN JAPAN: 15TH-19TH CENTURY," Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155 (through Dec. 31). The hard-to-grasp term kazari refers to the decorative arrangement of objects. And it is demonstrated with enchanting results in a show that demolishes the cliche of Japanese art as inherently minimalist. Here everything is layered: something is always in front of or behind or above something else, and each something has its own painted, incised or embroidered intricacies. This results in a total environment of conspicuous but elusive richness, encompassing painted screens, samurai jackets and Kabuki costumes that sag under acres of padded silk and gilded thread. It's maximalism all the way. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students and 65+ (Cotter).

* "THE LEGACY OF GENGHIS KHAN: COURTLY ART AND CULTURE IN WESTERN ASIA, 1256-1353," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Feb. 16). You may arrive expecting a little more razzle-dazzle from an exhibition that is supposedly about a bloodthirsty conqueror, but Genghis Khan doesn't actually have much to do with this. The show is really about his heirs, including Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan dynasty in China, and Hulagu, who subdued Baghdad and established the rule of the Ilkhanids. The interchange between China and Iran under Mongol rule is the show's leitmotif. There are textiles, works of gold and silver and illuminated books, which are astonishing. (There are 21 illustrated pages from the Great Mongol Shahnama, one of the masterworks of Islamic art.) Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

"DAGOBERT PECHE AND THE WEINER WERKSTATTE," Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 (through Feb. 10). This survey of the Austrian designer Dagobert Peche (pronounced DAH-go-bert PEH-kuh) is a case study in the use of material objects to effect cultural reform. And the installation is as lively as any design show New York has seen. Peche, who died in 1923 at age 36, represented the second generation of the Wiener Werkstatte, whose designers regarded decorative objects as ideological vessels. But his highly ornate work is in full contrast to the spartan aesthetic associated with the movement. With more than 400 drawings and objects on view, the show is a tumble of stylized flora and offers an equal range of materials: fabric, wallpaper, precious metals, ceramics, wood and glass. Like Philippe Starck and Ettore Sottsass today, Peche designed rooms of inner nature, enclosures for emotion. Hours: Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 65+ (Herbert Muschamp).

Galleries: Uptown

* "ART OF THE SAMURAI," Scholten Japanese Art, 63 East 66th Street, (212) 585-0474 (through Dec. 6). Militaristic samurai culture produced some of the wildest looking armor ever made. You'll get a full sense of its extraterrestrial oddity and delicacy in this show, where complete suits of armor are supplemented by displays of helmets, swords and woodblock prints. It's a dynamite show (Cotter).

* JOSEPH CORNELL, Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997 (through Dec. 20). The hauntingly powerful, nostalgic universes that Joseph Cornell built from bits and pieces of the real world are displayed in this show of more than 30 works -- toys, objects, box constructions and collages -- arranged in early honor of the artist's centenary at the end of next year. They include examples of his aviaries, cases enshrining cut-out wooden birds; sand boxes, in which colored sands shift when their container is shaken; soap bubble sets that qualify as pipe dreams, and celestial boxes like the stunning "Untitled (Jupiter in Pisces)," from about 1958, in which the planet, looming in blue interstellar space, is seen in its zodiacal position over a close-up dreamscape. Of particular interest are the toys and tchotchkes he made, not often exhibited. There are more than enough treasures here to overcome occasional lapses into preciousness (Glueck).

"THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF ARTHUR WESLEY DOW," Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810 (through Dec. 7). Dow (1857-1922) was a painter, printmaker, photographer and teacher whose art melded Western and Asian elements to strikingly decorative effect. A body of his photographs, long buried in family holdings, reveals the relationship of his camera work to his paintings and prints. Early on, he produced eloquently simple impressions of his New England environment, sometimes using a process that let a photographic image resemble a drawing or print. As he developed technical and aesthetic savvy, he took his camera to California, India and Japan, producing pictures that stressed form and abstraction. In revealing his strengths as a photographer, this show throws new light on Dow's overall work (Glueck).

Galleries: 57th Street

WILLIAM CLUTZ, Katharina Rich Perlow, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 644-7171 (through Dec. 7). Since the late 1950's, Mr. Clutz has been painting the street life of New York, simplifying its complexity to the brink of abstraction. The canvases in this five-decade survey call to mind Edward Hopper's romantic nostalgia and Alex Katz's suave modernity (Ken Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

* KARIN DAVIE, Mary Boone, 541 West 24th Street, (212) 752-2929 (through Dec. 21). Spirits will be lifted by Ms. Davie's exuberantly sensuous abstract paintings. Undulating, striated ribbons in high-contrast colors fill the canvases, seeming to balloon into three-dimensional space and threatening to burst the rectangular edges of the picture. Painting wet into wet with seemingly effortless spontaneity, Ms. Davie mixes Abstract Expressionism, Op and Pop into pictures of ravishing visual plenitude (Johnson).

FORCEFIELD, Daniel Reich, 308 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (917) 408-9097 (through Dec. 21). Forcefield, an artist collective based in Providence, R.I., produces sculptures, films, posters, costumed performances and music. The members have exotic names like Patootie Lobe, Meerk Puffy, Gorgon Radeo and Le Geef. They made quite an impression in the last Whitney Biennial with a roomful of sculptures that suggested a cross between stocking puppets, Yoruba gelede dancers and intergalactic couture models. Even in Reich's tiny studio-apartment space their distinctive aesthetic comes across, and however it's defined it is part of a bigger collective something out there that is more than welcome in a cautious time for American art (Cotter).

JERALD IEANS, Lucas Schoormans, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3159 (through Dec. 14). This young, self-taught painter produces economical, well composed arrangements of biomorphic forms on medium-large canvases. With their overlapping, amoeboid shapes in shades of gray or muted pastels, finely combed textures and sharp edges, Mr. Ieans's paintings have great decorative appeal. Slyly sophisticated updates of Miro-style Surrealism, they are formally restrained yet funky (Johnson).

* BRUCE NAUMAN, Van de Wegh Fine Art, 521 West 23rd Street, (212) 929-6633 (through Dec. 14). This three-decade survey administers a substantial dose of Bruce Nauman's cerebrally punishing visual poetry. Neon signs feature flat-footed wordplay; one, for example, blinks "war" one way and "raw" the other. Most repellant are sculptures made from the animal forms used by taxidermists: a mobile has dangling cast-aluminum dogs with legs cut off and re-attached in reverse (Johnson).

GEORGE SUGARMAN, "Yellow to White to Blue to Black," Gary Tatinstian, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 633-0110 (through Dec. 21). One of the most interesting sculptors of the 1960's, Sugarman would organize eccentrically shaped, brightly painted objects into sprawling groups, playfully blending Cubism, Matissean color and Post-Minimalism installation. Along with collages from the 50's and 60's, this show features a three-part sculpture from 1967. Each colored, laminated wood piece is a paradoxical mix of complexity and simplicity, elegance and awkwardness; they go together like a jazz trio (Johnson).

LISA ZWERLING, First Street Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, (646) 336-8053 (through Dec. 7). Ms. Zwerling paints romantic fantasies of harmony among humans, animals and nature in a delicately naturalistic style. The main attraction here is a rocky landscape in which a naked child armed with a violin casts a musical spell over such savage beasts as a bear, a lion and a pair of wolves (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

ENID BAXTER BLADER, "Letter From the Girl, Mailed at the Gas Station," Location One, 26 Greene Street, (212) 334-3347 (through Dec. 28). Cerebral film buffs might find in Ms. Blader's 18-minute video projection all kinds of inside references and jokes about film noir, B movies and other sorts of low-end cinematic Pop. A puzzling montage of scenes set in a rural wasteland features a woman in a trench coat on the run, a mysteriously menacing 1980's-style bar girl and an overweight bleached blonde looking for someone who remains unspecified. Instead of plot, there's a curious blend of suspense and tedium (Johnson).

"FRIDA'S WORLD," Cavin-Morris, 560 Broadway, at Spring Street, (212) 226-3768 (through Jan. 4). If Frida Kahlo was as tempestuous as the new biographical movie has it, you would never know it from this selection of vintage portraits by various photographers, in which she invariably radiates a regal, mysteriously contained dignity. Her husband, Diego Rivera, appears, too, but is no competition for the uni-browed one's photogenic magnetism (Johnson).

JESSICA HIGGINS, "Poet Walk (The Diamond Forest)," Lance Fung, 537 Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 334-6242, (through Dec. 7). Ms. Higgins, who is 38, studied with some of the original members of Fluxus and is the daughter of two of the movement's pioneers, Dick Higgins and Alison Knowles. Here she presents a kind of poetic forest. Hundreds of black strings hanging from tree branches have tags attached like leaves on vines. Each tag bears a word or a syllable and these combine into haikus as you read across from string to string. It's a delicate mix of the visual, the spatial and the verbal (Johnson).

* CHRIS JOHANSON, "Now Is Now," Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, (212) 343-7300 (through Dec. 21). Mr. Johanson's funny and touching faux-naive painting, drawing and sculpture seem the products of an inspired simpleton's holistic vision. An installation in which a ship goes round and round, driven by a pivot arm balanced by a cartoon moneybag, represents the futility of materialism; smaller works spoof New Age therapy culture, like a picture of people dancing in silly cat suits, one exclaiming, "This is an excellent workshop!" Under the satiric surface, there's a genuine religious yearning (Johnson).

"DAN KEPLINGER, A K A KING GIMP," Phyllis Kind, 136 Greene Street, (212) 925-1200 (through Dec. 7). The subject of the 2000 Oscar-winning documentary, "King Gimp," Mr. Keplinger has cerebral palsy, which keeps him in a wheelchair and requires him to paint using a brush attached to his head. Despite these obstacles he paints and draws with ambitious verve, creating aggressively expressionistic self-portraits in acrid, muddy colors. This is the 29-year-old artist's second New York solo, and it shows a heartening determination (Johnson).

PAUL NOBLE AND GIOVANNI BATTISTA PIRANESI, Susan Inglett, 100 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0573 (through Dec. 14). Among the most impressive works in the Museum of Modern Art's "Drawing Now" exhibition are Mr. Noble's huge architectural fantasies. His two etchings on view here, though ordinary in scale, are similarly absorbing in their detail and narrative lunacy. They are well matched by four views of ancient ruins by Piranesi, the great 18th-century printmaker and architectural visionary (Johnson).

"ROSIE LEE TOMPKINS: AFRICAN-AMERICAN QUILTMAKER," Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through Dec. 28). Ms. Tompkins's ravishing quilts connect to several traditions, including African bark cloth paintings, American textiles and, not least of all, modernist painting. But look, don't think. These pictorial powerhouses are like multifaceted jewels spread flat before the eye yet turning in the light, their sparkling shards of color and mutating geometries full of mystery and life (Smith).

"ANDY WARHOL: MODEL," Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, (212) 226-3232 (through Dec. 21). If you are fascinated by the famously enigmatic Warhol persona, this barrage of portraits could cure you. The show features over 300 images of the artist by the photographer Christopher Makos. Most interesting is a huge series of formal portraits of Warhol in women's makeup and various wigs. Contact sheets show him posing as a fashion model. Video clips are also on view, including his cameo appearance on "The Love Boat" (Johnson).

Galleries: Downtown

"ALIVE AND KICKING: THE COLLAGES OF CHARLES HENRI FORD," the Scene, 42 Rivington Street, (212) 674-0508 (through Jan. 15). Ford, who died in September at 94, was an early version of today's global artist. Born in Mississippi, he moved back and forth among America, Europe and Asia, producing copious amounts of poetry, but also films, sculptures and, in the early 1990's, a series of small, Surrealist-tinged collages. He seems to have clipped material from design, nature and soft porn magazines, then pieced the visual data together with shrewd wit, binding the series with the motif of half-abstract figures resembling those found in early Dubuffet. Someday we'll get a retrospective; meanwhile, this show makes an important contribution (Cotter).

VIRGIL MARTI, Participant, 95 Rivington Street, (917) 488-0185 (through Dec. 22). Participant is Manhattan's newest nonprofit alternative space and for its inaugural show Mr. Marti, a Philadelphia artist, has covered the walls in sheets of reflective mylar, the kind used to raise plants (notably marijuana) in hydroponic gardens. Each sheet is imprinted with images of flowers and patterns of broken linear grids. Suspended from the ceiling are chandeliers made from colored resin casts of deer antlers, with blossoms at the tips. The results merge pop culture, weird science and the psychedelic wooziness of a funhouse mirror, disconcertingly crowned by trophies of a kill (Cotter).

Other Galleries

* "THE AGES OF MANKIND: TIME TO HOPE," Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 932-7347 (through Dec. 6; daily, 9:30 a.m. to noon and 1 to 5 p.m.; tonight and tomorrow night, to 9). All but unheralded, this show seems to have dropped into New York like an unbidden gift, and what a gift: 100 superb examples of Spanish religious art, which is some of the most rapturous and wrenching religious art ever made, seen in a perfect setting. The works include Romanesque madonnas, Gothic crucifixions, paintings of saints by El Greco and Goya, and a handwritten letter by St. Teresa of Avila, all from churches, monasteries and museums in the Spanish provinces of Castile and Leon. The images, among them life-size polychrome sculptures, are sexy, gruesome and above all theatrical, projecting big, primary emotions. The effect is gloriously intense (Cotter).

ROBERT BOYD, "The Virgin Collection," Schroeder Romero, 173A North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 486-8992 (through Dec. 2). This scrupulously thought-through solo show revolves around the figure of a mannequin dressed in a white satin bridal gown and a pointed Ku Klux Klan-style hood. It is shot through with references to racism, homophobia, consumerism culture and family values, all of which form the artist's slippery, elusive targets (Cotter).

ALEX GREY, Tibet House, 22 West 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 807-0563 (through Jan. 3). Mr. Grey's painting, with its tantric symbolism, medical-illustration finesse and New Age optimism, might be described as psychedelic realism. In it the human figure is rendered with X-ray or CAT-scan transparency, the way Aldous Huxley saw a leaf when he was on mescalin. Mr. Grey's images have been appropriated by a countercultural audience: they have shown up on promotional posters for rave events and on paper used for blotter-style LSD. But they look right at home at Tibet House, where contemporary versions of religious tankas, meant for esoteric instruction and meditation, often hang (Cotter).

Last Chance

LOUISE BOURGEOIS, Susan Sheehan, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 489-3331 (through tomorrow). Sketchy prints from the 1990's by this eminent sculptor afford fleeting glimpses of a mysteriously elusive mind. A suite of drypoints is devoted to spiders, who symbolize the artist's mother; one comical howling arachnid is shown giving birth. "Anatomy," a 12-piece portfolio, includes a torso with multiple pneumatic breasts; a picture of sultry, slightly crossed eyes; and a naked woman hanging by her long hair from a laundry line (Johnson).

* "MADE IN CHICAGO: CIRCA 1970," Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338 (through tomorrow). This engrossing selection of works by Chicago Imagists includes beautiful paintings of anxious encounters between weirdly deformed men and women by Jim Nutt; a numinously nostalgic farmscape by Roger Brown; antic watercolors of striving tubular people by Gladys Nilsson; a mysterious, fetishistic painting by Christina Ramberg; and H. C. Westermann's first "Death Ship" (Johnson).

"PAINTED SAWS: JACOB KASS," American Folk Art Museum's Eva and Morris Feld Gallery, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue near 66th Street, (212) 595-9533 (through Sunday). After six decades as a decorative painter of commercial trucks in Brooklyn, Kass (1910-2000) retired to Vermont and began painting landscapes on old handsaws and other tools. Thus he transformed himself into a modern folk artist. Most compelling is the way the tapered saw blade becomes a trapezoidal window through which to view bucolic landscapes painted with a sensuous, skillful but not too fussy touch. Crisscrossing perspectives in urban scenes creates compositions bordering on Cubism. Avoiding gimmickry and excessive sentimentality, Kass produced objects of forthright charm. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free (Johnson).

* "POUSSIN, CLAUDE AND THEIR WORLD: 17TH-CENTURY FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM THE ECOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS, PARIS," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Sunday). The Ecole des Beaux-Arts (founded in 1648), assembled an enormous collection to instruct its students in drawing. Those from the 17th century, the great age of Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, are especially outstanding. The 71 here survey French drawing from 1620 to 1680, when classicism came to French art, aiming to restore High Renaissance ideals of clarity, order and balance, with the Italian painter Raphael as a revered model. The emphasis is on the works of Poussin (1594-1665) and Claude (1604-1682), a history painter and a landscapist. But lesser-known masters like Simon Vouet, Eustache Le Sueur and Charles Le Brun are also included. Hours and admissions: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $12; $5, students; $8, 62+ (Glueck).

"QUEENS INTERNATIONAL," Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700 (through Sunday). This selection of work by 40 artists, from 12 countries but all now living in Queens, includes paintings, videos, performance art, installations and other contemporary forms. The art reflects the globalization of postmodernist pluralism as much as -- if not more than -- cultural diversity. Highlights include intricately patterned, mandala-form collages by Marietta J. Ganapin; John L. Moore's dreamy, supplely painted abstractions; Larry Litt's politically provocative video "The Blame Show"; and James Johnson's full-scale copper-clad fantasy airplane, more offbeat labor of love than professional sculpture. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 55+ (Johnson).

* "WINOGRAND 1964," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 860-1777 (through Sunday). In 1964 the photographer Garry Winogrand crisscrossed the United States, taking nearly 20,000 photographs along the way. Here are around 150 of them, most never shown before. Winogrand was a hit-and-miss artist, and the show could have been edited. But together the images add up to a fresh, divinely eccentric portrait of America after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The resonance with 9/11, though obvious, goes unstated. Winogrand captured how America once again transformed catastrophe into commerce, an inevitable but also strangely redemptive process. Hours and admission: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $9; $6, students and 62+ (Kimmelman).

HEADLINE: Optimism Among Midsize Manufacturers 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
A new survey of chief financial officers at midsize manufacturing companies found substantial optimism about business prospects in 2003, corroborating a recent spate of positive data on the economy but differing with the views of America's top chief executives.
 Fleet Capital collected 673 responses from a survey of financial executives at randomly selected manufacturers with annual revenue of $25 million to $1 billion. Almost 7 in 10 of the executives expected the economy to expand next year. A roughly equal portion predicted that their own revenue would increase in 2003, compared with just half in the survey a year ago. 
 Four in 10 of the chief financial officers said access to credit had eased the last year, and most gave the current economy fairly positive grades.
"A lot of people have found their sea legs in a two-year storm, and are maybe starting to see that the roughest part is behind them," said James G. Connolly, president and chief executive of Fleet Capital. Nonetheless, he added, "being better doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be great."
The economy did fare better in the third quarter than most forecasters had expected. The Commerce Department recently revised its figure for growth to 4 percent, from 3.1 percent. And data released Wednesday suggest that the economy may surprise the experts again in the fourth quarter.
Among the most surprised may be executives at the biggest companies. The results of Fleet Capital's survey help to outline a trend that has lately emerged in the nation's corporate sector: the smaller the company, the more optimistic its owners and executives.
Small-business owners canvassed in October for the National Federation of Independent Business's monthly report suggested that the economy might manage moderate growth, at a rate of up to about 3 percent, in the months to come. Only 9 percent said they expected to cut their payrolls in the next six months, while 14 percent said they planned to take on more workers. 
Two weeks ago, the Business Roundtable released results from another survey, in which chief executives at many of America's biggest companies predicted that the economy would manage only meager growth, of 2 percent or less, in 2003. Sixty percent said they would cut payrolls next year, compared with only 11 percent who said they would add workers.
Mr. Connolly said that executives of smaller businesses may be more optimistic than those of giant companies because they are less likely to become caught up in the general malaise of accounting scandals and lower stock prices. "Their feedback to us is more related to what they're seeing in real demand from their customers or their salespeople telling them what they've seen out on the road," he said. "It's probably a little more detailed than the chief executives who tend to get caught up in the mainstream consensus."
The data giving rise to that consensus took a turn for the better on Wednesday. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending rose by 0.4 percent in October, the most since July. First-time claims for unemployment benefits fell last week to 364,000, their lowest level in almost two years. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago's index of manufacturing activity beat expectations and surged into territory that indicated growth for this month. And orders for long-lasting goods like cars and crockpots also posted fairly robust gains of 2.8 percent in October, according to the Commerce Department.
The only damper on the economic outlook also came from a broad-based study. The Federal Reserve Board's beige book of anecdotal dispatches on the economy, published on Wednesday, reported sluggish activity in many areas during October and early November.

Vote by United Mechanics Raises Odds of Bankruptcy
United Airlines' mechanics rejected a proposed package of wage and benefit concessions, forcing the two sides back to the bargaining table as the world's second-largest airline struggles to avert bankruptcy.
 The rejection comes as United is facing a critical Monday deadline for making a $375 million payment on debt backed by aircraft. United officials said yesterday that they would decide on Monday whether to make the payment, or take advantage of a 10-day grace period. Page A1. 

Survey Finds Optimism on Economy
A new survey of chief financial officers at midsized manufacturing companies found substantial optimism about business prospects in 2003, corroborating a recent spate of positive data on the economy but differing with the views of America's top chief executives. C4.

Bertelsmann's New Challenge
Bertelsmann completed its acquisition of the Zomba Music Group this week, but now the hard part begins: convincing Zomba's executives not to rush for the door. If Bertelsmann fails to retain key executives, its $2.7 billion acquisition of Zomba -- a deal that many analysts already consider expensive given the deteriorating economics of the music industry -- could seem even less attractive. The departure of key executives could open the door to artist defections, industry executives said. C4.

Paraguayan Economy to Contract
The financial crisis that began in Argentina a year ago and soon spread to the rest of South America has also been pummeling Paraguay, a landlocked nation of 5.5 million people. The economy will contract by 4 percent this year. The national currency has lost 30 percent of its value against the dollar since January. And in the space of less than a week, the minister of finance and the president of the central bank both resigned. C3.

Private-Label Clothes Get Star Turn
Private-label apparel brands have long been the neglected stepchildren of department stores, receiving minimal advertising support or prime floor space. But the stores -- needing to attract customers who are shunning them for specialty retailers and discount chains like Target -- are increasingly investing in the design and promotion of their once homely brands, giving them the star treatment as if they were designer labels like Liz Claiborne or Jones New York.

HEADLINE: Tobacco Money Could Harm Credit Rating Of Some States 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
State and local governments across the country are turning to tobacco to plug their deficit gaps at a time when states are under the worst fiscal pressure in decades.
 But using the billions of dollars from the industrywide tobacco settlement in 1998 could cause more harm than the politicians have been willing to acknowledge. 
 Eight states are using proceeds from the tobacco settlement to reduce state budget deficits, and six more are considering it, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Five of these states have already had their credit ratings lowered by the three main credit agencies or have been placed on alert about the possibility. New Jersey and Wisconsin have been downgraded, while California, Oregon and Washington are on the alert lists. When ratings are lowered, states have to pay more when selling bonds to compensate investors for the additional risk, raising their costs of capital by millions of dollars for projects from roads to schools. 
To generate revenue now, these states are selling municipal bonds tied to some or all of the first 25 years of expected payments from the tobacco companies, under a pact signed with 46 states that has been valued at $206 billion. The rating agencies are concerned that states may be opting for a one-time infusion to help reduce a deficit and that such borrowing is a sure sign of fiscal distress.
"We are not downgrading because they are using tobacco," said Alex Fraser, a director of the state and local government ratings group at Standard & Poor's. "We are downgrading because this state or that state is running out of options. Tobacco securitization is one of the last nonrecurring options that are out there."
The credit rating agencies are likely to lower a state's credit rating if the state fails to convince them that a longer-term solution for its deficit is in the offing.
The use of the tobacco revenue this way "is a good indicator of who is under stress," Mr. Fraser said. The use of the tobacco money "indicates something that may form the basis for a downgrade."
Claire Cohen, a public finance analyst at Fitch Ratings, said, "Yes, indeed, it can lead to a lower general obligation bond rating." Robert A. Kurtter, senior vice president for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service, agreed. "Yes, it can be a factor, and yes, it has been a factor."
What a lower bond rating could cost a state is hard to calculate because states have different needs for financing and the use of tobacco revenue was not the sole cause of any of the downgrades. Still, rating agency officials and underwriters of municipal bonds said that a cut of one notch could raise the interest rates on a new bond by as much as 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. For a big state issuing a lot of debt, it could amount to millions of dollars of extra interest payments.
When New Jersey announced last spring that it was going to compress about half of 25 years of annual payments of $250 million to $270 million from the tobacco settlement into $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2003, the governor's budget said that this fiscal maneuver would not put the state's "credit rating at risk." Even before the tobacco deal was completed, though, Fitch, Moody's and S.& P. had lowered the state's credit rating a notch.
"The magnitude of the state's budget funding challenge will only be solved over multiple years as indicated by the proposed inclusion of temporizing measures in fiscal 2003, including over $1 billion in a proposed securitization of tobacco settlement revenues," Fitch said in a statement announcing the downgrade, to AA from AA+.
Tom Vince, spokesman for the New Jersey treasurer, John E. McCormac, said the connection of the tobacco revenue and the lower rating "has to do with the use of these funds as a temporary infusion."
"Credit agencies like recurring revenue," he added. New Jersey will sell additional bonds to use the other half of the state's tobacco revenue in fiscal 2004, which begins in July, and 2005, he said.
New York State lawmakers are considering use of tobacco money to cover its budget gap. When asked about such a possibility last week, Gov. George E. Pataki said, "I don't want to rule anything in or out at this point."
Such a maneuver, said Mr. Kurtter of Moody's, would show "that they are pursuing a risky strategy with the hope of growing out of the problem in the future. This is the sign of a relatively weaker credit."
New York, however, might not suffer a further credit downgrade by Moody's because it already has the agency's lowest rating for a state, A2, as does Louisiana.
But New York's rating could fall at the hands of S.& P. and Fitch, which put it three notches higher, at AA, the equivalent of an Aa2 rating from Moody's. "Anytime a state looks at borrowing from future revenue to solve their deficit problem it definitely raises an eyebrow," said Richard Raphael, a public finance analyst at Fitch.
California is expected to do the biggest tobacco securitization by far in the first half of next year, raising about $4.5 billion from a bond issue by committing about 85 percent of its future tobacco revenue to pay the principal and interest.
Tobacco has always helped balance state budgets, with cigarette taxes accounting for $8.6 billion, or 1.5 percent, of total state revenue in fiscal 2002.
What the states are doing now with tobacco is called securitization. They are selling bonds to get cash now and using the years of revenue that they are expecting from the tobacco settlement to pay the principal and interest on the bonds. So they are forgoing a steady stream of revenue well into the future for the use of that money today.
According to the National Council of State Legislatures, 15 states have securitized or are in the process of securitizing their tobacco revenue, with seven of them dedicating the money for purposes like health care and anti-tobacco programs. Some counties and cities in California and New York have also converted their future tobacco revenues to current cash, including New York City. The city was the first to sell tobacco bonds back in 1999 and is scheduled to sell more. But the money has been used and will be used, according to the city, to finance the city's capital budget, not to cover everyday spending.
The use of the tobacco settlement revenue for capital projects is not frowned on by the credit agencies because borrowing is usually done to pay for these projects. Even using tobacco revenue to cover an operating budget would not necessarily be a cause for a downgrade if it were part of a broad plan to restore financial stability. It is the fact that in most cases so far the tobacco money is a one-time nonrecurring revenue that worries the credit rating agencies. The use of a so-called state rainy day fund, if there is no plan to replenish the fund, would raise the same red flag for credit analysts.
Credit agencies are also worried that the money is being borrowed over a long period, like 20 years. In the past, bonds sold to cover operating costs have usually been paid off more quickly. Borrowing over a longer period just raises the possibility that the state or local government will be under fiscal stress much longer.
The eight states that plan to use tobacco money to help cover deficits are California, Iowa, Missouri, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin. States considering such action are Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New York and Texas.

HEADLINE: For an Economic Proselytizer, Another Highly Visible Pulpit; 
Attention, Good and Bad, Follows Jeffrey Sachs

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
Almost from the day he received tenure in the Harvard economics department at the extraordinarily young age of 28, Jeffrey D. Sachs has forged a reputation as a professor who much prefers practicing and preaching to theorizing. He brought that outlook with him when he moved to Columbia University recently. The Ivy League has never meant an ivory tower to him.
 Besides running a research center with 1,000 employees, giving lectures and advising students, he campaigns for medical aid to poor countries, helps the secretary general of the United Nations with economic development strategies and advises heads of state and government on financial policies. Oh, yes -- he also hangs out with rock stars. 
 But some people who have followed his work closely say they think that his real brilliance is in public relations. His attempts to fix crises abroad and influence policies for development have consistently directed the attention of experts and ordinary people to pressing economic problems. So by bringing Professor Sachs on board last summer, Columbia has guaranteed itself a bigger voice -- if a controversial one -- on the world stage. 
"He appears to distance himself from things he's done that are not perceived as success stories and cozy up to those that were, after the fact, seen as successful," said Janine R. Wedel, associate professor of public policy at George Mason University in Arlington, Va. She studied Professor Sachs in action when he was advising governments in Eastern Europe.
Moreover, Professor Wedel said, it has not always been clear whom he was representing at a given time -- his own consulting firm, Harvard, international financial institutions, the United States or a local government. Nor has it been clear where all of his financing has come from or how he has spent it.
"Such ambiguity of roles, as Sachs and others like him have, doesn't serve well the people who are getting advice and don't know the motives and income sources of the consultants who are providing it," she said. "And the shifting mix of roles certainly doesn't serve well those donors or governments who are trying to provide impartial advice."
No one, including Professor Wedel, doubts Professor Sachs's brilliance and determination, and even his harshest critics say that he often gets results. As a prominent advocate for the problems of poor countries, he has been hailed as a visionary even while being criticized as a showboat.
"He's a passionate person," said Nancy Birdsall, president of the Center for Global Development, a policy research group in Washington of which Professor Sachs is a director, "and what I like about it is that the passion is mixed with some real deep understanding. Usually, in the nongovernmental organization community, we have people who are very softhearted, but they lack that hardheadedness."
Professor Sachs began his career as an innovative expert on international economics in the early 1980's. Once he received tenure at Harvard, he shifted his attention from theory to practice, traveling extensively to advise countries in economic crisis. Then he became director of a Harvard research institute and a leading proponent of debt relief for poor countries.
Now he is director of the Earth Institute at Columbia and a professor with appointments in three of the university's schools. He is also an economics adviser to at least a half-dozen countries, a point man on development for Secretary General Kofi Annan at the United Nations and a tireless advocate for big injections of foreign aid to fight AIDS, malaria and other diseases that ravage poor countries.
Professor Sachs's reputation as an academic economist and as a savior for countries in economic distress has eroded since its peak a decade ago. At that time, he was the best-known advocate of economic "shock therapy" for former Soviet-bloc nations -- a rapid, often painful, transition to minimally regulated capitalism. Despite a record others may call mixed, he still maintains that a barnstormer like him is crucial to victory in the good fight.
"It's the essence of what I do," Professor Sachs said of his work with Mr. Annan and Bono, the singer who lobbies for aid to developing nations, and of his visits to two or three foreign capitals a month. "I could not figure out anything that I really need to understand without doing it also. You can't do all that you need to do in understanding economics sitting in an office."
That philosophy took hold early in his life. Growing up in the volatile Detroit of the 1960's, with a father working as a lawyer for organized labor, he quickly became attuned to social issues and the plight of the less fortunate.
His early academic work, however, focused on international finance and business cycles -- topics important to economic well-being, but only distantly relevant to grass-roots efforts to fight poverty. He received tenure at Harvard in 1983, just three years after joining the faculty.
At first, he kept up a torrid pace of publishing in the competitively refereed volumes of academic economics' top journals. Within a few semesters of receiving tenure, however, he slowed down in that area, and eventually stopped.
By 1985, he had found a new, more exciting occupation: country doctor. That is, a doctor for countries.
In July 1985, he arrived in Bolivia to advise the government on how to quell its inflation, which was running at one of the fastest paces the world had ever witnessed.
"As I was stepping off the plane, I was a young hotshot tenured professor at Harvard," he said. "I thought I knew a lot." After one glance around, he said, "I realized how little I knew."
Professor Sachs helped Bolivia stabilize its prices, but he soon found out that other countries would not succeed so easily. Other Latin American countries that he advised in the 1980's, including Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador, continue to tilt in and out of financial crises. On the other hand, Estonia, Slovenia and Poland -- the last after several years of significant hardship -- became stable market economies after shock-therapy treatments.
But Russia, where he worked from 1991 to 1994, was too riddled by crime, corruption and political rifts to respond to such policies as quickly as its former satellites, experts now agree. Instead, living standards dropped by half in Russia during the three years that Professor Sachs advised President Boris Yeltsin.
Professor Sachs's prestige in academic circles suffered with time, too.
"He got this reputation of trying to be too influential in policy-making and not taking firm ground in the academic literature," said Thierry Verdier, who directs the economics institute at the Ecole Normale Superieure, a top French university, and runs the program on international trade at the Center for Economic Policy Research in London.
Questions about academic rigor have sprung up in the midst of Professor Sachs's latest campaign, which seeks a substantial increase in foreign aid for disease-fighting drugs and other public health measures for poor countries.
A report drafted by a committee he led contended that spending $101 billion on health would save eight million lives a year and lead to additional annual income gains of $186 billion. Vaccines and preventive measures costing just $40 a year per person, the report argued, would pay vast dividends in poor countries around the world. Yet the confidence with which the report made those claims, experts later commented, was not backed by the kind of airtight statistics that most economic and medical journals demand.
In response, Professor Sachs said that his job was to convince policy makers of the orders of magnitude involved, if not the exact numbers. "How sure am I that it's $40 rather than $50, or that you'll save eight million lives rather than seven million? Not sure at all," he said. "But I am sure that the returns are so vast compared to the costs that it's worth doing."
That contention has elicited a spectrum of reactions from inspiration to frustration among other advocates for development.
Stewart J. Paperin, executive vice president of the Open Society Institute, a development group founded by the financier George Soros, said he was thrilled by Professor Sachs's approach. "He has done a great service to the profession by beginning to frame the dialogue not in terms of good versus bad, but in terms of relative payback on investment," Mr. Paperin said. "No one else has done that."
Richard G. A. Feachem, executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, also applauded Professor Sachs's campaigning, but he stressed that any large-scale aid would have to start small. "That's not an argument against a big, bold program," he said, "it's just noting that you can't go from A to B overnight."
Debating with doctors and donors about disease control has been a departure for Professor Sachs, who previously stuck to standard economic topics like debt and market institutions. Now his horizons are expanding even further, to encompass every aspect of the planet.
The Earth Institute at Columbia, which he has directed since July 1, has hundreds of geochemists, engineers, biologists, ecologists and others working in settings ranging from the Iquitos flood plain in Peru to the Arctic Circle. Its affiliates include only 10 or 20 economists, Professor Sachs estimated. The institute's new mandate, he said, is to pursue strategies for sustainable development: increasing prosperity, especially for the poor, without threatening the planet's future.
Professor Sachs has headed big organizations before. He once simultaneously ran Harvard's Center for International Development and its much bigger counterpart, the Harvard Institute for International Development. The center focuses on academic programs in international development, while the institute, which closed shortly after Professor Sachs left it, solicited public and private grants worth millions to provide economic advice around the world.
In 1999, he quit the institute at a time of crisis. Its budget had grown to $40 million, eclipsing spending by Harvard's schools in the fields of dentistry, design, divinity and education. Part of that money, from the federal government, was to help Russia develop capital markets and new commercial and civil laws. But Washington cut off its support in 1997 after it claimed to have discovered that senior advisers whom Professor Sachs had supervised (and later fired) were speculating in Russian securities even as they were advising the government on economic policy. According to former colleagues, problems with Professor Sachs's management style, rather than these events, led to his departure. 
Wallace S. Broecker, a climatologist and 44-year veteran of Columbia's faculty who serves on the Earth Institute's academic advisory committee, said he felt comfortable having a renowned economist at the top. Professor Sachs's hiring, he said, was meant to bridge the gap between the social and natural sciences. In addition, he said, Professor Sachs brings enormous energy to the job.
Professor Sachs's tenacity is the one trait about which his newest and oldest colleagues -- and his most devoted supporters and most outspoken critics -- can agree.
"He's a controversial figure, and he's polemical in public -- those two facts go together -- but he is strongly and deeply motivated by the desire to use economics to make the world a better place," said Barry J. Eichengreen, a professor of economics and political science at the University of California at Berkeley who taught alongside Professor Sachs at Harvard in the early 1980's. "He is as strongly motivated to do that as anyone I know in the profession."

3 Global Policy Superstars Sharing Turf at Columbia
With Jagdish N. Bhagwati, Jeffrey D. Sachs and Joseph E. Stiglitz, Columbia University has an unmatched trio of prominent voices in the debate on globalization and economic development. Yet these three men have not had much to do with one another in public, either by debating their differences or joining forces to push for change.
Professor Bhagwati, who holds posts at several prominent organizations, including Human Rights Watch and the World Trade Organization, spends most of his time in the economics department, where he answers his own phone, or at the nearby Council on Foreign Relations.
Professor Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate who is reachable only by sending e-mail to a member of his staff, heads the Initiative for Policy Dialogue, a group he founded to explore alternatives for economic policy in developing countries.
Professor Sachs, besides his duties advising foreign governments and the United Nations, heads a multimillion-dollar institute that studies all aspects of economic, environmental, technological and social development. He can be reached by phone, but his contacts are screened by a public relations specialist.
When asked if the three would interact more in the future, Professor Sachs said he hoped that they would. Professors Bhagwati and Stiglitz both issued prepared statements to the same effect.

HEADLINE: From Artichokes to Zinfandel, Farm Tours Expand 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: CASTROVILLE, Calif., Nov. 23 

 BODY:
Some tourists flock to California to see Hearst Castle, Sausalito, Big Sur and the Golden Gate Bridge. Then there are those who come for the breathtaking views of artichokes.
 "I want to talk to you about artichokes," said Evan Oakes, founder of Ag Venture Tours, possibly the country's first company specializing in agricultural bus tours for tourists, as he wielded a field knife before sightseers huddled beside a prickly field. "In Egyptian tombs, in Syria and Babylon, they were talking about artichokes." 
 While artichoke tourism may never rival Disneyland, Mr. Oakes, 41, an agricultural research scientist, may represent the Next Big-to-Medium-Size Thing. His bus tour, a sort of 4-H Club for Dummies, is part of a national trend toward agricultural tourism. It is a daylong, fact-filled 80-mile or so gambol through "the nation's salad bowl": the Salinas Valley, the fertile fog-layered land made famous by John Steinbeck. Here, about 50 percent to 75 percent of the country's vegetables are grown, ruled by "the king," as Mr. Oakes calls iceberg lettuce.
"We wanted to try something different," said Dr. Leon Fournet, 60, a maxillofacial surgeon from Metairie, La., who was aboard Mr. Oakes's tour van with his wife, Martha. "We'd been to wine country. I love to cook. I wanted to learn about the things we eat every day."
Let birders obsess over "life lists." Those aboard Mr. Oakes's vegetable safaris get a list of "Major Monterey County Agricultural Commodities," to check off vital produce spotted en route. To the left, a scenic overlook of radicchio. To the right, a majestic vista of broccoli.
"Romaine lettuce is the hottest thing, because everyone is eating Caesar salad now," Mr. Oakes observed from behind the wheel before beginning a discourse on seed pelletization, an industrial process that coats seeds to make them more uniform and easier to plant by machine.
"Have you ever made candied nuts?" he asked the passengers, who included Erica Weber, 78, a tourist from Lucerne, Switzerland. "It's the same idea. But instead of sugar you're using clay material and fungicide."
While Mr. Oakes's tour is offbeat, it is a tiny but potentially fertile seed in the flourishing movement of agricultural tourism. In states like Vermont and Wisconsin, farm tourism, including "agri-tainment" like U-Pick-'Em Christmas tree lots and Victorian high teas amid hay bales, is on the rise. (Spotted in Brainerd, Minn.: a beef and pork tasting room.)
In California, one of 20 states promoting agricultural tourism, direct marketing -- including hay rides, farm stands, income from farmers' markets, and bed-and-breakfasts on farms -- accounts for $75 million a year, a small but increasingly significant part of the state's $20 billion agricultural industry, said Desmond Jolly, an agricultural economist and director of the University of California's Small Farm Center in Davis.
In Vermont, tourism-related agriculture, including sleigh rides, maple sugar visits and wool spinning, represents $10 million in income for 3,000 small farms, said Jackie Folsom, program coordinator for the Vermont Agritourism Initiative, a federally financed program that works with farmers to promote tourism.
The interest in agricultural tourism represents the convergence of several major cultural trends.
"There is a growing concern about where food comes from," said Kent Gustafson, an extension educator in tourism at the University of Minnesota. "And families with young kids are looking for real, authentic experiences beyond Six Flags."
Dr. Jolly, of the University of California at Davis, said Mr. Oakes was "on to something." 
"Agriculture is basically cultivated nature," Dr. Jolly said, "and this is part of nature tourism. Just as people love to go to national parks and visit forests, they are fascinated with learning how agriculture -- which is well-managed nature -- works. It's part of a healing process."
While Mr. Oakes's tour is not overtly about healing, he does address many profound changes in the American landscape, like tallying farm worker productivity with computers and suburban sprawl. As the van sped past a billboard for a housing development in Salinas, for example, Mr. Oakes confided that "seven years ago we used to do lettuce experiments here."
Sprawl is considered "the most threatening problem we face," said Ken Lewis, the owner of the 800-acre Gabilan View Farms outside Salinas. It is more dangerous, Mr. Lewis said, than even two-spotted mites in a strawberry field, which can be controlled by releasing reddish-orange predator mites -- 75,000 per acre.
To Mr. Lewis and other farmers, visits by Mr. Oakes's van are an opportunity for public relations.
"You hear so much about agriculture raping our resources and polluting our streams," Mr. Lewis said. "It's not all like that. In every industry, there are always rogues like Enron. But most of us are true husbanders of the soil."
Farmers learn from tourists, too. After making numerous references to what "the housewife" finds appealing about strawberries, Mr. Lewis was confronted by Frances Shaffi, a real estate developer from Monterey.
"I'm going to gag," Ms. Shaffi said. "The correct term is consumers, not housewives!"
Mr. Oakes, who wears an enamel artichoke pin on his left lapel, specializes in wine grapes. He subsidizes his agricultural tours with trips to more mainstream destinations like Hearst Castle and Salinas Valley wineries. A former assistant farm adviser with the Monterey County Agricultural Center in Salinas, he now consults with the University of California. Five years ago, he realized that preaching to the unconverted might be more satisfying than "standing out in the middle of fields taking soil samples and counting aphid colonies on lettuce plants."
Agricultural tourism, he said, is more highly developed in Europe, especially in Italy, where rural tourism is seen as a way of maintaining the heritage of villages and revitalizing their economy.
Whether people will come to share his passion for the life cycle of broccoli remains a question.
"People don't know where their food comes from," Mr. Oakes said. "Here, they see it. But most tourists want to go on the 17 Mile Drive and then visit Carmel and go shopping. Let's face it."
Meanwhile, the living embodiment of everything a visitor always wanted to know about farm scenery but was afraid to ask rolls on by.
"Is that mustard?" Ms. Shaffi asked, eyeing a fleeting field of yellow flowers.
"Weeds," Mr. Oakes replied.

HEADLINE: Down and Out, Golden Gate Is Planning to Pass the Hat 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
The Golden Gate Bridge is down on its luck and grateful for any loose change you can spare. 
 The transit agency that runs the 65-year-old bridge is so short of cash, not unlike many transit agencies around the country, that in September it raised tolls by $2, to $5. That was not enough, so last week the agency began slashing commuter bus routes and ferry services. 
 Now, still hundreds of millions of dollars in the hole because of a troubled economy and unexpected expenses after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, the agency is asking for public handouts to keep it afloat. 
Big bridge. No money. Please help.
"If someone wants to drop $2 in a box to enjoy that beautiful bridge, we'll take it," said Maureen Middlebrook, a vice president of the bridge's board of directors. "We will take money wherever we can get it."
Contribution boxes will be erected near the sidewalk entrances to the main 1.2-mile suspension span once the winter rains end and tourism picks up. The solicitations will be modeled after those at some museums and national parks and might include a suggested minimum donation, an amount not yet determined. 
"We will have a sign with information about the bridge, saying, 'Leave us your dollar or yen, or whatever, we appreciate it,' " said Mary Currie, director of public information for the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District, the agency that operates the bridge. For the last three decades, the district has also run ferries between San Francisco and Marin County and bus services in Marin, Sonoma, Contra Costa and San Francisco Counties.
Ms. Middlebrook described the plan for donations, which has not yet been widely promoted, as "an opportunity for people to share their caring" for the bridge. But not everyone is as charitable. Joseph V. Blue, another of the district's 19 directors, likened the effort to panhandling.
"That is humiliating," he said.
Mr. Blue, a real estate investor and newcomer to the board, said the handouts were "like putting a Band-Aid on cancer." He also criticized another idea under consideration: charging pedestrians and bicyclists to cross the bridge. That proposal was shelved last month, at least for the time being, after an outcry from the city's formidable bicycle lobby.
"We are not talking about just any bridge, we are talking about the greatest bridge in the world," Mr. Blue said. "I am dumbfounded that we got to this point."
While the financial crisis has been hard for some San Franciscans to fathom, the bridge's problems are unusual only in their severity and notoriety. Transit agencies nationwide are having tough times.
Elsewhere in the Bay Area, BART train ridership has declined for 15 months, leading to fare increases and new parking fees. The Valley Transportation Agency in Santa Clara County is cutting jobs and services because of a drop in state sales taxes and a $167 million deficit. 
Across the country, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is projecting a $50 million deficit next year, with cuts in services and fare increases under consideration. Ridership, which had been growing 8 percent a year, rose 3 percent last year, said Steven Taubenkibel, a spokesman for the authority. "We are reviewing everything under the sun to reduce costs," Mr. Taubenkibel said.
In New York City, tunnel and bridge traffic across the Hudson River began to fall last year even before Sept. 11, with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reporting 4.4 million fewer eastbound vehicles than in 2000. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, meanwhile, which runs buses, subways and railroads in New York and its suburbs, expects a budget deficit of $1 billion next year.
"Every transit agency in the country is facing some loss of riders," said Prof. Elizabeth A. Deakin, director of the University of California Transportation Research Center in Berkeley. "You have a confluence of security costs and a bad economy that makes it tough for these agencies to keep their commitments."
Though no one keeps an exact count, tourism surveys in San Francisco consistently rank the Golden Gate Bridge among the city's top attractions. Last year about 15.7 million people visited the city, but Mr. Blue and other skeptics expect few of them to dig deeply into their pockets.
"If after six months we get $100, I would be glad to give it to you," Mr. Blue said.
Practical or not, the bid for donations reflects a worsening financial crisis that district officials said threatened maintenance of the bridge's two main cables and the deck floor's beams and trusses, and the final phase of a seismic strengthening that began in 1997. The two maintenance projects would cost $84 million combined and the seismic work $160 million.
"They are on the got-to-do list, but we don't have the money," Ms. Currie said. "We got to the edge of the cliff faster than we predicted. When you take a straight hit across your organization, your budget is going to hurt."
With fewer cars crossing the bridge, ridership down on buses and ferries, and security and insurance bills mounting, the district faces a $296 million deficit over the next five years. The projected shortfall had been $441 million, but was lowered after the toll increase in September. The expenses include $700,000 a year for 11 new security employees. Insurance premiums jumped to $1.2 million, about double the amount of last year.
The district raised the toll for most motorists to $5 from $3, the first increase in 11 years. Though the toll remains lower than some in other parts of the country, it is more than double the amount charged at the Bay Area's seven state-run bridges. Reaction was swift and negative, with motorists complaining in public hearings, in e-mail messages to the board and on radio talk shows.
Last week, the cost-cutting extended to the agency's bus service when the board voted to eliminate 14 routes with low ridership, including eight shuttles to ferry terminals. More cuts are planned; officials estimate a quarter of the district's bus and ferry services may be eliminated over the next year.
"It is taking a certain level of courage to be honest and make the decisions we have to make," said Ms. Middlebrook, a public affairs consultant in Sonoma County. "We have a lot of elected officials on the board, making it very difficult to vote for toll and fare increases."
Meanwhile, in the quest for new sources of cash, the district is considering issuing Golden Gate Bridge credit cards and vanity license plates. More fare increases for buses and ferries are being studied, as are salary freezes and benefits caps for the district's 1,000 employees.
This week, many administrative employees were encouraged to stay home and take their accrued vacation time or lose it because there was no money left to reimburse them for unused days. District officials estimate that if the financial situation does not improve soon, they will be unable to meet payroll obligations in about 17 months.
"Managing a bridge right now is not a lot of fun," Professor Deakin said.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE FOOTBALL; 
11-1 Iowa Can Only Sit and Wait

BYLINE:  By JOE LAPOINTE 

 BODY:
Almost two weeks ago, after Iowa beat Minnesota to complete its regular season at 11-1, Hawkeyes fans tore down goal posts to celebrate a team that went undefeated in the Big Ten, clinched a share of the league title and enhanced its chance to go to a major bowl game.
 But this day was unusual not only because Iowa's season ended three weeks ahead of some teams but also because the celebration took place on the road. At least a third of the 65,184 fans in the Metrodome cheered for the Hawkeyes in their 45-21 victory. 
 Such loyalty bodes well for the postseason games. In the parlance of bowl business, Iowa "travels well." Hawkeyes fans buy tickets, rent hotel rooms, eat at restaurants and boost the economy of any bowl site. 
But they don't know yet which site they will visit. When they finally play again, after more than six weeks off, there is a slight chance that it could be in Tempe, Ariz., against co-Big Ten champion Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl for the national championship.
There is a greater possibility that it will be in Pasadena, Calif., against a Pacific-10 Conference team in the Rose Bowl in a traditional matchup of conferences. And a third and lesser option is Orlando, Fla., in what is now known as the Capital One Bowl.
The uncertainty is a byproduct of the Bowl Championship Series formula. The complex B.C.S. has already named Ohio State (13-0) for one berth. The opponent will emerge on Dec. 8 when the final B.C.S. standing appears.
The Hawkeyes are ranked fifth in the B.C.S., having climbed in the last six weeks from 13th. They are No. 5 in The New York Times computer ranking, No. 4 in the Associated Press poll and No. 3 in the ESPN /USA Today poll of coaches. Iowa could reach first or second place in the B.C.S. only if No. 1 Miami, No. 3 Oklahoma and No. 4 Georgia all lose.
 Ohio State did not play Iowa this season, and some observers believe the Hawkeyes would beat the Buckeyes if they met. So the debate intensifies:
 *Should the 11 Big Ten teams be forced to play each other, increasing the conference schedule from 8 to 10 games while decreasing the number of nonconference games?
 *Should the Big Ten break into two divisions and stage a championship game, as in the Southeastern Conference and the Big 12?
 *And should Division I-A have a tournament, like in Division I-AA, to settle the national championship debate on the field?
 Iowa Coach Kirk Ferentz supports the status quo, even while the Hawkeyes wait to learn their status. "I'm sure everyone at Ohio State would feel the same way; we'd probably love to line up and play," Ferentz said. "But, this is one of those years that leaves things open to debate. Basically, it looks pretty firm that we are going to the Rose Bowl. And the Rose Bowl is a great prize." Iowa last played there after the 1990 season.
 Ferentz said, "Playing nonleague games is very important to the development of our team" and not worth giving up for more conference games. He said leagues with divisions and championship games still have debates. "I've heard people say that so-and-so may have won but they play a soft interdivision schedule."
 How about a national tournament? "I like the bowl system," he said. "A lot of teams play and half of them go home as winners." Referring to last winter, when Nebraska lost the national championship to Miami in the Rose Bowl, Ferentz acknowledged that some critics found the Cornhuskers unworthy.
The solution, Ferentz said, is "maybe you take the top four teams and let them play two ballgames." But no more than that. "I'd really worry about the playoff system like Division I-AA when you might be playing 14, 15 and possibly 16 games," Ferentz said.
 With 11 teams in the conference, one had to be idle while five games were played last Saturday. Ohio State, ranked No. 2 in the B.C.S., finished by beating Michigan, 14-9. The Hawkeyes watched it together on television and grumbled afterward. Comparing his team with the Buckeyes, linebacker Fred Barr said: "Our guys are a little more physical and a little more determined. I think we would definitely win."
Events could work against Iowa. Should Miami lose one of its last two games but remain in the top four of the B.C.S. and Notre Dame defeats Southern California on Saturday to move up from seventh into the top six, the Hawkeyes could miss both the Fiesta and the Rose.
Jim Delany, the commissioner of the Big Ten, when asked about the possibility of not having a conference team in the Rose Bowl for two consecutive seasons, said: "We only have the right to have our champion there" and that Ohio State, committed elsewhere, is technically the champion because it is undefeated.
 "After that, Iowa's an at-large team," Delany said. "The Rose Bowl can select them. But they don't have to. We were there for 47 years." Nancy Atkinson, the sports information director of the Tournament of Roses, said her group would choose Iowa as long as another, major B.C.S. bowl does not choose the Hawkeyes first.
 In his four seasons at Iowa, Ferentz's teams were 1-10, 3-9, 7-5 and 11-1. Iowa finished undefeated in conference play for the first time since 1922. The Hawkeyes outscored their opponents by 467-218. Their only defeat was by 36-31 at home to Iowa State on Sept. 14 after Iowa squandered a halftime lead of 24-7.
Their best-known player is Brad Banks, the senior quarterback and Heisman trophy candidate who has 25 touchdown passes and five rushing touchdowns this season. Ferentz said most of his players are "mutts," like the "sixth- and seventh-round draft choices, free-agent type guys" on the fringes of rosters in the National Football League.
Ferentz put himself into that category because many fans wanted Iowa to hire Bob Stoops, who went to Oklahoma. "I was maybe not the sexiest candidate out there," said Ferentz, 47, who played linebacker at Connecticut, worked for nine years as an assistant at Iowa under Hayden Fry before working as an N.F.L. assistant with Cleveland and Baltimore.
 As for speculation that he could soon be recruited by a professional team, Ferentz answered with a rhetorical nondenial. "Believe me, college recruiters are good at putting that one out there for recruits," he said, referring to competing colleges who vie for the same high-school players. "Why would I want to leave? This is a great place for my family."

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS; 
Restriction on Visits Is Maintained

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
The International Olympic Committee voted overwhelmingly tonight to keep a ban on members' visits to cities competing to play host to the Games.
 The ban on visits was upheld after only 6 of 118 members attending a general assembly here voted to lift it. 
 It was imposed in 1999 to stop the solicitation of bribes and the giving of gifts among Olympic officials and potential hosts. Ten committee members were forced from their posts after taking cash, scholarships and other inducements from the organizers of Salt Lake City's successful bid for last February's Winter Olympics. 
That scandal, said the committee's vice president, Kevan Gosper, of Australia, "nearly killed us."
Even before Salt Lake City, bribes of up to $1 million were demanded by committee members from civic boosters and city officials, according to at least one committee official.
Some committee members took the ban as an insult, arguing, in so many words, "How can you vote for a city when you have not had a chance to visit it?" said Francois Carrard, the committee's director general. 
But Carrard said that "the way visits took place in the past was unacceptable." The prevailing view, he said, was, "No more visits, no more gifts."
Members of the Olympics Committee also said today that they had built a cash reserve of $140 million as a hedge against the possible cancellation of future Games by terrorism, war or mischance. At the 1972 Games in Munich, a Palestinian group killed 11 Israeli athletes and coaches. An unsolved bombing at Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park in 1996 killed one person and injured about 100.
"International terrorism poses a certain risk to sports," the committee's president, Jacques Rogge, said. "Armed conflicts and the prolonged economic crisis may also have effects on the quality and staging of the Games."
The next Olympics are scheduled for 2004 in Athens, a city where terrorist attacks have occurred in the past. The security costs at Athens, members said, will approach $600 million.
Rogge also said that the committee would open preliminary negotiations with American television networks for broadcast rights to the Games for 2010 and the years to come. NBC has the television rights through the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
The committee will vote Friday on whether to eliminate baseball, softball and the modern pentathlon from the 2008 Games. Some committee members support dropping those sports as part of an effort to keep the cost and the complexity of the Games from growing out of control.

HEADLINE: Falling Crime In New York Defies Trend 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
It is a question as compelling as any of the mysteries that police officials and criminologists routinely encounter: Why should crime continue an 11-year decline in New York City when it is on the rise elsewhere around the country?
 Policing strategies? At least a dozen other cities adopted some of the New York Police Department's innovative programs following their successes, and while crime declined in several, others have seen crime rise. 
 Drug use? New York City is no longer the crack capital of America, and experts say hard drug use here has waned. But in some cities with apparent downturns in drug use crime has risen, and in some with intractable drug problems crime has dropped.
The economy? Since the Sept. 11 attack, New York has faced fiscal problems as bad as any city in the nation, with a $6.4 billion budget deficit for the next fiscal year and a 7.8 percent unemployment rate coupled with increasing homelessness and a shrunken welfare roll. But its resilient crime declines have continued despite the failing economy. 
Prison population? The number of people in the city being sentenced to terms in state prison, where those convicted of more serious crimes serve their time, has steadily declined over the last decade, with nearly half as many people entering the system last year compared with 1990.
"It is the mystery of the ages," said Jeffrey A. Fagan, a professor of law and public health at Columbia University who has studied crime and New York City's criminal justice system for 15 years. "Certainly no one has articulated what the right variables are that will produce a crime increase when configured in one way in a city and, when configured another way in a city, will produce a decline."
Not everyone, however, says they are stumped by the phenomenon. New York Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly cites the failure of many cities to make the sustained investment New York undertook more than a decade ago, when the Safe Streets, Safe Cities program began the remarkable expansion that eventually increased the ranks of the department by nearly 40 percent.
With the larger force, which eventually peaked at 40,710 officers, Mr. Kelly's predecessors, including William Bratton, the first of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's three police commissioners, used new programs, including Compstat, a system of crime mapping and management accountability that has been exported from New York to other cities, to focus on serious crimes and quality-of-life violations. Some contend that such petty offenses lead to more serious crimes.
Michael Jacobson, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says that focus on smaller crimes -- and, over the last eight years, the arrests of about one million people on minor violations for which they spent the night in jail -- has characterized the New York City approach more than anything else.
And while Professor Jacobson, who headed the city's Correction and Probation Departments under former Mayors David N. Dinkins and Giuliani, was wary of suggesting that the strategy alone was responsible for New York's success, in the face of crime increases elsewhere, he says it has given the police the opportunity to check warrants and search suspects, and thus helped get guns off the streets and reduce crime. 
At the same time, he says, the practice brought with it a host of problems, not the least of which was the fraying effect such zero tolerance approaches have on the already tense relationship between police officers and residents in some of the city's poorer neighborhoods they patrol. 
But criminologists and police officials around the nation are far from uniformly embracing any of the theories for the drop in crime. And so to some, there are other factors at work in addition to police strategies, the economy and patterns of drug use, such as the involvement of communities with the police, and demographic and social forces. While to others, it is beyond knowing without additional study. "Crime has been going down for a decade, and people are still fighting about why," Professor Jacobson said.
But New York City's continuing crime reduction appears to be a fact, not an interpretation. Murder and auto crime, the two statistics criminologists consider most reliable because dead bodies and stolen cars seldom go unreported, both have continued to drop this year. As of last week, murder was continuing its robust decline, down 12.7 percent over the same period last year, while car theft was down 9.8 percent and overall crime was down 5.3 percent.
The same good news, however, has not held in many other cities.

Crime Inches Up Nationwide
F.B.I. statistics released at the end of last month for the 2001 calendar year show crime rising nationwide for the first time since 1991, with murder inching up 2.5 percent over 2000, car thefts up 5.7 percent and robberies up 3.7 percent. Overall crime rose 2.1 percent over the previous year, with crime increases in cities on both coasts and in the nation's midsection.
In Boston, the statistics show, overall crime, car theft and murder rose in 2001, with killings up sharply, jumping to 65 from 39, an increase officials there called an aberration after 10 years of almost steady declines, with fewer than 40 murders in each of the last three years. So far this year, overall crime in Boston is down slightly, and with 51 killings through the end of last week, the city appears on track to end the year with fewer murders than it had in 2001, but still far more than the figure for 2000.
Over the same period, after years of declines, murder and overall crime also climbed in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Phoenix and San Antonio, among other cities, according to F.B.I. statistics, with killings jumping 48 percent in Las Vegas, 37.5 percent in Phoenix and 17.6 percent in San Antonio. Murder also rose in Chicago and Los Angeles, which with 602 homicides so far this year has already surpassed last year's tally of 587, according to that city's most recent statistics.
The reasons for some of the increases cited by police officials and sociologists are as varied as the communities themselves. They range from the release from prison of a particularly violent cadre of criminals and their efforts to re-establish street-corner hegemony in Boston to the law enforcement's shift in focus along the Southwest border after the Sept. 11 attacks and its impact on the murder rate in Phoenix.
In Boston, the crime declines over the last decade were so drastic they have been referred to as the Boston Miracle. They have been widely credited to a novel relationship between the police there and a group of black clergy, which served as an intermediary with the city's poorer communities. Murder, fueled by gang- and drug-related homicides, peaked in 1990 with 152 killings. Over the next 10 years, the number plummeted to 39, as the murder rate nationwide also declined, while at a significantly slower rate. But last year, the number of killings jumped to 65, according to the F.B.I. statistics.
Christopher Winship, a sociology professor at Harvard University who has studied the relationship between the police and the clergy in Boston cites an increase in felons returning to communities from prison over the last two years. In a paper on the phenomenon published in March, he said that as many as 250 people a month were flooding from prison into the city's neighborhoods.
"The belief is that many recent killings involve retribution and/or attempts to retake drug markets that were lost when the individuals were sent to prison," Professor Winship said. 
A spokesman for the Phoenix Police Department said the sharp jump in killings there -- to 209 in last year from 152 the previous year -- should be examined in the context of the murder rate over time, noting that killings in the city hovered around 200 annually for more than five years. The dramatic increase came after the particularly low number in 2000, when stepped-up federal law enforcement along the Southwest border cut drug trafficking, greatly reducing the number of killings tied to the trade, said the spokesman, Sgt. Randy Force.
The next year, after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, when shifting priorities moved the focus away from the Mexican border, the pace of killing in Phoenix quickened, he said. While overall crime rose 7.6 percent in 2001, it came after what Sergeant Force said was a 20 percent drop over five years.
The reported increases in these and other cities and in the country as a whole came as little surprise to many who follow crime trends, because experts have long questioned when the steady declines would end and crime would begin to rise again, a pendulum swing that many criminologists view as inevitable. But several said it was too soon to reach to any conclusions about whether the F.B.I. statistics represent a turnaround or a broader trend.
"After 10 years of decline, one year of a moderate increase doesn't necessarily mean anything," said Jerome H. Skolnick, a law professor at New York University, where he is the co-director of the Center for Research on Crime and Justice.

The New York Exception
While the explanations for New York's continuing crime decline vary widely, many experts agree that it is particularly noteworthy because Mr. Kelly and several top aides have spent much of the past year working to prevent possible terrorist attacks, creating an entire Counterterrorism Bureau and reorganizing the Intelligence Division to focus on terrorism as well as traditional crime. The department has marshaled significant resources toward that end, with 1,000 officers re-assigned to counterterrorism units. 
New York's continuing crime declines have come despite drops in summonses and misdemeanor arrests -- key parts of the zero tolerance program -- and the budget cuts, which combined with attrition have reduced the force from its peak to about 38,000. That number is likely to shrink by several thousand more officers.
So, with the F.B.I. numbers raising the possibility that a nationwide turnaround could be at hand, some current and former New York police officials believe Mr. Kelly's most significant challenges lie ahead, and experts say the question of why New York's crime rate keeps going down becomes an even more pressing issue.
One academic is trying to answer at least part of that question by examining the impact of Compstat in other cities where it has been adopted. They include Philadelphia and Baltimore, where former New York police officials oversaw significant declines, and others where crime initially dropped but later began to inch up. 
Andrew Karmen, a sociology professor at John Jay College who has written a book about the city's murder rate, "New York Murder Mystery," has begun a study on more than 12 cities outside New York that have adopted the program. "The easy answers -- the economy, improved policing and greater incarceration -- don't hold up if you look carefully," he said.
Professor Karmen has also urged the establishment of a special city- or state-financed commission to examine New York's successes. "Something very special and positive is happening in New York," he said. The city's experiences needed to be studied, he added, "so that should things begin to reverse, we will have an idea why, and so that other cities can learn."

HEADLINE: Seneca Falls Journal; 
Dump Vexes a Real-Life Bedford Falls

BYLINE:  By The New York Times

DATELINE: SENECA FALLS, N.Y., Nov. 27 

 BODY:
Finding connections between the fictional Bedford Falls and the real-life Seneca Falls has become a matter of civic pride in this old Finger Lakes mill town. Frank Capra visited the area before making his 1946 classic, "It's a Wonderful Life," and many here are convinced that their hometown inspired the movie's setting.
 Comparisons peak each December with a celebration called "It's a Wonderful Life in Seneca Falls." This year's festivities, which begin on Dec. 6, will feature a visit by Karolyn Grimes, who played Zuzu Bailey in the movie, and "Clarence sales" at downtown stores. 
 Yet if George Bailey has been cast as the town's chief promoter, many believe that Mr. Potter is lurking at the northwestern edge of town, where the state's largest active landfill takes in an average of 6,000 tons of garbage and industrial waste a day.
The landfill, officially known as Seneca Meadows but scorned by many as Mount Trashmore, spans 530 acres. Refuse is trucked in from throughout central New York and is piled in dirt-covered mounds that rise high above the flat terrain.
Although detractors complain about the dust, the odors and the thousands of gulls hovering and swooping above the site, revenues from Seneca Meadows have paid for many of the public improvements intended to attract visitors and new residents.
"I weigh the pros and the cons," said the town supervisor, Peter Same. "The cons are odor and traffic. The pros are finances."
But that trade-off is suddenly getting a second look. Last month, when word spread that the landfill operators wanted to expand, many residents cried foul. A public hearing on Nov. 14 to discuss possible rezoning to allow operations on adjacent farmland drew hundreds of people. While officials of Seneca Meadows, which is privately run, emphasized their contributions to the local economy, many residents spoke against the plan and hundreds of voters signed petitions opposing it.
Two days later, an eight-hour fire at Tire Solutions International, across town from the landfill, destroyed about 5,000 scrap tires. The fire at the tire recycling facility prompted local officials to declare a state of emergency, asking residents not to leave their homes. The fire was quelled, in part because of firefighting foam supplied by Seneca Meadows, which keeps the substance on hand in case of a fire at its own tire recycling operation.
But the timing could not have been worse, Mr. Same said. Although the tire fire had no other connection to Seneca Meadows, it reminded people of a 1999 fire at the landfill that led to the evacuation of 1,500 people. Seneca Meadows officials described the fire as a flare-up fueled by a chemical dumped by the Seneca Army Depot, a closed base.
"We certainly don't want to be thought of as the dumping ground for New York State," Mr. Same said. "We're a bedroom community, a tourist destination." Still, he said, people need to understand that without landfill dollars, municipal spending will go down and taxes will go up.
Seneca Falls has an agreement to collect 4.5 percent of the landfill's gross revenues. As waste operations have grown, so has the town's income from the landfill, to an estimated $1.8 million in 2003 from $330,000 in 1991.
The money has become increasingly important as the community has lost industrial jobs to factory closings and cutbacks. Landfill revenues account for more than 40 percent of the town's $4.3 million budget and have financed a new community center, a downtown renovation and an expansion of the water system. Seneca Falls has not raised property tax rates since 1996.
But critics note that thousands of people come to the area to vacation along the lakes and to visit the Women's Rights National Historical Park and the National Women's Hall of Fame in downtown Seneca Falls. The first landmark they see when they exit the New York State Thruway is the Seneca Meadows landfill.
The location is also a concern because of the surrounding swamps and waterways, said Walter Hang, president of Toxics Targeting Inc., a company based in Ithaca that monitors waste sites around the state. The landfill sits in a marshy area between Cayuga and Seneca Lakes, bisected by a creek that drains into Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge, five miles away.
The Seneca Meadows property encompasses an earlier landfill, which the state has cited for future cleanup. Records of the State Department of Environmental Conservation note that residents in the area have been advised to rely on municipal water and not to use their old wells.
Carl Casaccia, executive vice president of Seneca Meadows, said the company consistently met state requirements and constantly monitored its operations for problems. He noted that the state environmental agency had a full-time inspector on the site.
The site has been used as a landfill for more than 40 years, and Seneca Meadows bought the property in 1983. At its current size, the landfill has the capacity to continue running for eight more years. Permit and environmental studies require lengthy review, so the company has to plan for expansion now, Mr. Casaccia said.
In the meantime, Seneca Meadows faces a public relations challenge.
"We are what we are," Mr. Casaccia said. "We are a landfill. That gives you a certain stigma."

HEADLINE: A Military at War Needs Its Gay Soldiers 

BYLINE:  By Alastair Gamble; Alastair Gamble is a former specialist in the Army.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It was only two months after I started learning Arabic at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, Calif., the military's primary language training center, that a group of Arabic-speaking terrorists attacked the World Trade Center. For many of my classmates, the attack was enough of a motivation to learn. For others, it was the taped interview with Osama bin Laden that strengthened our resolve. Either way, the events of Sept. 11 caused all of us to work even harder at mastering Arabic.
 I've always had a knack for learning languages, and I found myself picking up Arabic easily; I quickly became a confident speaker. As the course went on, my vocabulary grew from the simple to the relevant. I was able to converse not only about daily activities but also about military operations, economics and politics. The Middle East news broadcasts that my class watched between lessons became clearer each day. So did the tapes of Osama bin Laden. 
 By the end of the semester, eight of the 40 or so students who had started the class with me had failed out, and my eight-person section had fallen to six. I sometimes thought about what my future would hold. I imagined that in due time I would be able to use the language and my interrogation skills to question operatives of Al Qaeda.
Often our commander spoke to our group about the real-life application of Arabic that was in our future. And given the shortage of Arabic translators and interpreters in the military and intelligence communities -- about half of the Army's Arabic language expert positions are vacant -- our role in the war on terror would be vital.
Unfortunately, my service was cut short. There was something about me that, despite my skills and aptitude for the work, made me incompatible with military culture: I'm gay. The military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy makes no exceptions, even for personnel it needs desperately. 
From the beginning of my time in the Army, I tried hard to hide my sexual orientation. I wanted to serve. It wasn't always easy to keep my secret. One day a good friend from my language class approached me after noticing that I'd been spending a lot of time with a male soldier from another unit. She asked me if we could talk about what was going on. Leery of the military's policy on gays, I was nervous about answering in English, so I said, in Arabic, "I prefer men." She laughed and teased me for not telling her sooner.
But not everyone was so understanding. One night my boyfriend was caught in my room after visiting hours. Though we were not found in any embrace, inspectors found romantic notes we'd shared. Typical punishment for breaking visitation rules is 10 days of restriction and 10 days of extra duty, which I completed. But four months later I was dismissed from the Army. My boyfriend, who was studying Korean, was dismissed eight weeks later.
Instead of fighting in the war against terrorism, I am now an observer, left to wonder how our country can afford to lose the talents and dedication of gays who are denied the right to serve. In 2000, the military dismissed more than 1,200 service members because of their sexual orientation. Over the last few months, eight other Army linguists have been dismissed for being gay. 
The military invested thousands of dollars in my two years of training. In addition to the cost of intensive language courses, interrogation school and weapons training, it paid for a background check for my security clearance. Considering how many years the military has been throwing gays out, just imagine how much money, training and skills have been wasted already.

HEADLINE: In Media Res 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
This week Al Gore said the obvious. "The media is kind of weird these days on politics," he told The New York Observer, "and there are some major institutional voices that are, truthfully speaking, part and parcel of the Republican Party." 
 The reaction from most journalists in the "liberal media" was embarrassed silence. I don't quite understand why, but there are some things that you're not supposed to say, precisely because they're so clearly true. 
 The political agenda of Fox News, to take the most important example, is hardly obscure. Roger Ailes, the network's chairman, has been advising the Bush administration. Fox's Brit Hume even claimed credit for the midterm election. "It was because of our coverage that it happened," he told Don Imus. "People watch us and take their electoral cues from us. No one should doubt the influence of Fox News in these matters." (This remark may have been tongue in cheek, but imagine the reaction if the Democrats had won and Dan Rather, even jokingly, had later claimed credit.)
But my purpose in today's column is not to bash Fox. I want to address a broader question: Will the economic interests of the media undermine objective news coverage?
For most of the last 50 years, public policy took it for granted that media bias was a potential problem. There were, after all, only three national networks, a limited number of radio licenses and only one or two newspapers in many cities. How could those who controlled major news outlets be deterred from misusing their position?
The answer was a combination of regulation and informal guidelines. The "fairness doctrine" forced broadcast media to give comparable representation to opposing points of view. Restrictions on ownership maintained a diversity of voices. And there was a general expectation that major news outlets would stay above the fray, distinguishing clearly between opinion and news reporting. The system didn't always work, but it did set some limits.
Over the past 15 years, however, much of that system has been dismantled. The fairness doctrine was abolished in 1987. Restrictions on ownership have been steadily loosened, and it seems likely that next year the Federal Communications Commission will abolish many of the restrictions that remain -- quite possibly even allowing major networks to buy each other. And the informal rule against blatantly partisan reporting has also gone away -- at least as long as you are partisan in the right direction. 
The F.C.C. says that the old rules are no longer necessary because the marketplace has changed. According to the official line, new media -- first cable television, then the Internet -- have given the public access to a diversity of news sources, eliminating the need for public guidelines.
But is this really true? Cable television has greatly expanded the range of available entertainment, but has had far less broadening effect on news coverage. There are now five major sources of TV news, rather than three, but this increase is arguably more than offset by other trends. For one thing, the influence of print news has continued its long decline; for another, all five sources of TV news are now divisions of large conglomerates -- you get your news from AOLTimeWarnerGeneralElectricDisneyWestinghouseNewsCorp. 
And the Internet is a fine thing for policy wonks and news junkies -- anyone can now read Canadian and British newspapers, or download policy analyses from think tanks. But most people have neither the time nor the inclination. Realistically, the Net does little to reduce the influence of the big five sources.
In short, we have a situation rife with conflicts of interest. The handful of organizations that supply most people with their news have major commercial interests that inevitably tempt them to slant their coverage, and more generally to be deferential to the ruling party. There have already been some peculiar examples of news not reported. For example, last month's 100,000-strong Washington antiwar demonstration -- an important event, whatever your views on the issue -- was almost ignored by some key media outlets. 
For the time being, blatant media bias is still limited by old rules and old norms of behavior. But soon the rules will be abolished, and the norms are eroding before our eyes.
Do the conflicts of interest of our highly concentrated media constitute a threat to democracy? I've reported; you decide.

HEADLINE: Split in Ranks Of Business And G.O.P. On Tax Cuts 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
Even as President Bush hones plans to stimulate the economy with $150 billion or more in new tax cuts, business groups and many Republicans are split about where the money should go.
 Many business lobbyists insist that a top priority must be tax breaks aimed directly at corporations, because business spending is the weakest segment of the economy. 
 But a growing number of business and political leaders, including at least one influential industry group, want to funnel more money to lower- and middle-income taxpayers in an effort to generate more demand for goods and services.
White House officials have stepped up their work on a major tax-cut package, and some lobbyists say Mr. Bush could announce it within the next few weeks. 
But even among Republicans, there is enormous debate about how to persuade companies to invest in new factories and expand hiring.
"I am genuinely concerned that Republicans not be chastised for only helping business and the wealthy," said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who will become chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in January. "There has to be a balance between incentives for consumers and for investment."
The Business Roundtable, an organization of chief executives from large corporations, startled many of its normal allies last week by arguing that tax breaks for individuals would be more helpful than tax breaks for business.
Indeed, the Roundtable's top recommendation was one favored by many Democrats: bolstering tax relief for low- and middle-income families by temporarily cutting payroll tax contributions for Social Security and Medicare.
"There is substantial overcapacity in the economy, so we don't need more capacity right now," said John J. Castellani, the president of the Business Roundtable. "We felt it would be more prudent and effective to stimulate consumption."
Those words sent shivers through rival business groups -- like the National Association of Manufacturers -- which are pressing for big new write-offs on investments.
But they also reflected the murkiness of the current economic picture. Economists note that neither low interest rates nor last year's tax cuts did much to stimulate business spending.
White House officials appear to be divided as well.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, the director of the president's National Economic Council, has spoken broadly about the need to put more money in the hands of both companies and taxpayers.
Paul H. O'Neill, the Treasury secretary, has argued in favor of carefully delineated tax measures for industries in genuine distress.
Those differences reflect the baffling mix of growth and stagnation in the economy, which grew at a healthy annual rate of 4 percent in the third quarter but is expected to slow down to just over 1 percent in this quarter.
Consumer spending remains fairly strong, but manufacturing remains depressed and business investment is anemic. The nation's factories are running at only about 75 percent of capacity, and companies continue to delay big investments.
Some White House officials say they do not even like the word "stimulus" because it smacks of Keynesian pump priming.
Regardless of what one calls it -- "near-term growth package" is the favored White House phrase -- President Bush is determined to propose more tax cuts and the main issue will be who benefits from them.
A surprising range of people are pressing for measures aimed at ordinary taxpayers.
"The stimulus bill this year will be focused on helping workers rather than corporations," predicted Stephen Moore, the president of the Club for Growth, a conservative group that advocates deep tax reduction. "The problem the business community faces is that most people don't care about business taxes, whereas they usually do have an unpleasant relationship with individual taxes."
President Bush has already said he wants to make last year's tax cuts permanent, and he is likely to call for speeding up tax cuts that were supposed to be phased in over several years.
White House officials are juggling plans for a stimulus package with their longer-term goal of overhauling the tax code. Many would love to eliminate the so-called "double-taxation" of corporate dividends -- the taxation of dividends as both corporate profits and as income to shareholders.
But it remains unclear whether the White House will try to cut dividend taxes as part of a stimulus bill. The move would be expensive -- last year, corporations paid out about $210 billion in dividends. It would also be opposed by most Democrats.
Representative Michael G. Oxley, Republican of Ohio and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said House Republicans were ready to be aggressive in the wake of their election victories on Nov. 5.
"We can pass damn near anything in the House," Mr. Oxley told Bloomberg News on Thursday.
But the picture is quite different in the Senate, where Republicans have a two-vote majority and do not have the 60 votes they need to end a filibuster.
Partly for that reason, Senator Grassley vowed to seek out compromises with Senate Democrats and has spoken out strongly in favor of tax relief for middle-income families rather than for business.
Among the possibilities, he said, are speeding up an increase in the Child Tax Credit, to $1,000 from $600; speeding up relief for two-income couples who are pushed into higher tax brackets; and perhaps expanding the number of people who would be taxed at the lowest rate of 15 percent.
Support for tax cuts to lower- and middle-income workers is apparent on other fronts. To the astonishment of some Republicans, support is growing for a temporary cut in the 15-percent payroll tax for Social Security, possibly by excluding the first $10,000 of a person's earnings from the tax.
The idea has long been popular with many Democrats, because it would benefit low- and middle-income families.
"It gets money to people who need it and will spend it," said Senator Jon S. Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey, who pressed unsuccessfully for a payroll tax holiday last year and is proposing a six-month cut now.
But the idea received a new dose of support when the Business Roundtable listed a one-year exemption from payroll taxes on the first $10,000 a person earns.
Some business lobbyists were openly angry about the Business Roundtable, accusing it of undermining goals like lower corporate tax rates and more generous write-offs for plants and equipment.
"It's misguided," said Mark A. Bloomfield, the president of the American Council for Capital Formation, a Washington group that lobbies for lower corporate taxes. "Given where the weakness in the economy is, and given the weaknesses in the current tax system, there are places where the money could be used much better."

HEADLINE: After Freeing Dissident, Burmese Rulers Move Slowly on Reform 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
Six months after releasing the pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest amid a fanfare of promises, Myanmar's military rulers seem to have lost interest in political compromise.
 They have released only a trickle of political prisoners from among more than 1,000 who are behind bars. And they have dragged their feet on a pledge to open substantive talks with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and her political party, the National League for Democracy. 
 In place of the upbeat words that accompanied the announcement of her release on May 5, government officials have settled back into a familiar refrain: give us time.
"The process is moving forward," said Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt this month. "But such movement can only occur at a pace with which we are comfortable."
He added, "Much has been achieved already this year, and people have to understand the process may be slow because it is complicated."
There is no question about that achievement. After 19 months under house arrest, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was granted the most freedom of movement and political activity she has had in more than a decade.
She has made four trips outside the capital, Yangon, to rally supporters and has reopened more than 65 party offices, reviving a network that had almost been eliminated by the government.
But this has not been accompanied by the sort of cooperation and political accommodation she said the government promised her.
"We are prepared for dialogue with the government, and we have not set any preconditions," a spokesman for the party, U Lwin, said this month. But he has begun to sound a bit less upbeat than he did immediately after the release of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi.
"Since the beginning, we have been reading too much into her release," said Aung Zaw, the editor of Irrawaddy magazine and a leading figure among Burmese exiles.
"I think it was just part of their regular routine practices, to release her into a larger cage," he said. "But I think it was very premature to call it a political milestone."
In a sign that foreign nations are losing patience, the American deputy secretary of state for Asia and the Pacific, James A. Kelly, this week offered the strongest warning yet by the Bush administration.
"We are at the point where, absent further progress, the process that has begun may well falter," he said on Sunday. "If progress remains elusive, Burma must consider the possibility that other countries may join in measures with us, such as a ban on new investment."
The United States has led international economic and political sanctions against the military junta, which took power in 1988 and then nullified the results of a parliamentary election in 1990 that was won overwhelmingly by the National League for Democracy.
Although it may resist cooperating with the opposition, Myanmar's military government badly needs international aid to revive its mismanaged economy and to address severe public health problems, including the rapid spread of AIDS.
"It is by no means certain that attempts to work with the government to avoid a health disaster will succeed," wrote Robert Templer in a recent report for the International Crisis group, a policy institute. "What is certain is that the country cannot stem the tide without immediate, substantial and sustained financial and technical support."

HEADLINE: Reefer Madness 

BYLINE:  By BILL KELLER; E-mail: billkeller@nytimes.com

 BODY:
We interrupt our coverage of the war on terrorism to check in with that other permanent conflict against a stateless enemy, the war on drugs. To judge by the glee at the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, the drug warriors have just accomplished the moral equivalent of routing the Taliban -- helping to halt a relentless jihad against the nation's drug laws.
 Ballot initiatives in Ohio (treatment rather than prison for nonviolent drug offenders), Arizona (the same, plus making marijuana possession the equivalent of a traffic ticket, and providing free pot for medical use) and Nevada (full legalization of marijuana) lost decisively this month. Liberalization measures in Florida and Michigan never even made it to the ballot. 
 Some of this was due to the Republican election tide. Some was generational -- boomer parents like me, fearful of seeing our teenagers become drug-addled slackers. (John Walters, the White House drug czar, shrewdly played on this anxiety by hyping the higher potency of today's pot with the line, "This is not your father's marijuana.") Some may have been a reluctance to loosen any social safety belts when the nation is under threat. Certainly a major factor was that proponents of change, who had been winning carefully poll-tested ballot measures, state by state, since California in 1996, found themselves facing a serious and well-financed opposition, cheered on by Mr. Walters. 
The truly amazing thing is that 30 years into the modern war on drugs, the discourse is still focused disproportionately on marijuana rather than more important and excruciatingly hard problems like heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines.
The drug liberalizers -- an alliance of legal reformers, liberals, libertarians and potheads -- dwell on marijuana in part because a lot of the energy and money in their campaign comes from people who like to smoke pot and want the government off their backs. Also, marijuana has provided them with their most marketable wedge issue, the use of pot to relieve the suffering of AIDS and cancer patients. Never mind that the medical benefits of smoking marijuana are still mostly unproven (in part because the F.D.A. almost never approves the research and the pharmaceuticals industry sees no money in it). The issue may be peripheral, but it appeals to our compassion, especially when the administration plays the heartless heavy by sending SWAT teams to arrest people in wheelchairs. Thus a movement that started, at least in the minds of reform sponsors like the billionaire George Soros, as an effort to reduce the ravages of both drugs and the war on drugs, has become mostly about pot smoking.
The more interesting question is why the White House is so obsessed with marijuana. The memorable achievements of Mr. Walters's brief tenure have been things like cutting off student loans for kids with pot convictions, threatening doctors who recommend pot to cancer patients and introducing TV commercials that have the tone and credibility of wartime propaganda. One commercial tells pot smokers that they are subsidizing terrorists. Another shows a stoned teenager discovering a handgun in Dad's desk drawer and dreamily shooting a friend. (You'll find it at www.mediacampaign.org. Watch it with the sound off and you'd swear it was an ad for gun control.)
Drug czars used to draw a distinction between casual-use drugs like marijuana and the hard drugs whose craving breeds crime and community desolation. But this is not your father's drug czar. Mr. Walters insists marijuana is inseparable from heroin or cocaine. He offers two arguments, both of which sound as if they came from the same people who manufacture the Bush administration's flimsy economic logic.
One is that marijuana is a "gateway" to hard-drug use. Actually Mr. Walters, who is a political scientist but likes to sound like an epidemiologist, prefers to say that pot use is an "increased risk factor" for other drugs. The point in our conversation when my nonsense-alarm went off was when he likened the relationship between pot and hard drugs to that between cholesterol and heart disease. In fact, the claim that marijuana leads to the use of other drugs appears to be unfounded. On the contrary, an interesting new study by Andrew Morral of RAND, out in the December issue of the British journal Addiction, shows that the correlation between pot and hard drugs can be fully explained by the fact that some people, by virtue of genetics or circumstances, have a predisposition to use drugs.
Mr. Walters's other justification for turning his office into the War on Pot is the dramatic increase in the number of marijuana smokers seeking professional help. This, he claims, reflects an alarming rise in the number of people hooked on cannabis. But common sense and the government's own statistics suggest an alternative explanation: if you're caught with pot, enrolling in a treatment program is the price of avoiding jail. And marijuana arrests have doubled in less than a decade, to 700,000 a year, even as use of the drug has remained static. In other words, the stampede of pot smokers into treatment is probably not a sign of more dependency, but of more aggressive enforcement.
So what's really going on at the White House drug office? I can think of three answers. One is that they are sincerely worried about pot. Marijuana is not harmless. Regular pot smoking can mess with your memory and attention span, your immune system and fertility. Mr. Walters may feel the dangers justify a lot of hyperbole.
A second explanation is the old political-bureaucratic imperative. To justify a $19 billion drug control program you need a threat that touches middle-class voters -- not just the few million mostly wretched, mostly inner-city, mostly nonvoting users of heroin and cocaine. And you want to be able to claim success. When he appointed Mr. Walters, President Bush announced he wanted "measurable results," and the measure would be a reduction in the number of people who admit to being recent drug users -- 10 percent by 2004. Well, since three-fourths of illicit drug users are pot smokers, the easy way to get the numbers down is to attack the least important aspect of the drug problem. That will give President Bush some bogus victories to boast about when he runs for re-election.
The third reason is the culture war. Mr. Walters is a veteran of the conservative political bunkers, where pot is viewed as a manifestation of moral degeneracy. "It's still about the war in Vietnam and growing your hair long," says Mark Kleiman, a drug law expert at U.C.L.A. and a thoughtful centrist in a debate monopolized by extremes. "It's the 60's being replayed again and again and again -- the S.D.S. versus the football team." For this White House, to give ground on pot would be a moral surrender.
Mr. Kleiman's view, which I find persuasive, is that the way to deal with marijuana is to remove criminal penalties for possession, use (recreational or medicinal) and cultivation of small amounts, but not to legalize sale. It's silly and costly to treat people as outlaws for enjoying a drug that is roughly as addictive as caffeine and far less destructive than tobacco or alcohol. At the same time, the inexorable logic of a legal marketplace would mean a lot more consumption and abuse. Consider this statistic: Fifty percent of the liquor industry's revenues are derived from alcoholics -- people who down at least four drinks every day. The sin business, whether it's a private liquor company or a state-run lottery, may preach responsible behavior, but it thrives on addiction.
Once you're past pot, you face the gloomy landscape of hard drugs, along with newer chemical worries like Ecstasy. If your experience of the hard-core drug world is mostly from movies like "Traffic" or two splendid HBO series, "The Corner" and "The Wire," you may be inclined to despair of easy answers. You would not be wrong. The moralistic drug war has overstuffed our prisons, left communities fatherless, fed corruption, consumed vast quantities of law enforcement time and money, and led us into some cynical foreign ventures, all without making drugs scarcer or more expensive. Legalization, on the other hand, means less crime and inner-city misery, but more addicts. 
The things worth doing are incremental and unglamorous and lacking in demagogic appeal. They aim not at winning a spurious war but at minimizing harm -- both the harm caused by drugs, and the harm caused by draconian enforcement. Almost everyone (including Mr. Walters, in principle) agrees that diverting drug users into treatment, preferably backed by the threat of jail, is much better than consigning them to prison. But liberalizers are all carrot, and drug warriors are all stick. The drug czar who so eagerly intervened in Arizona and Nevada has kept his distance from efforts to humanize New York's merciless and failed Rockefeller drug laws.
Drug reform requires not only money, creativity and patience, but also the political courage to face down ideologues. And political courage, you may have noticed, is a lot harder to come by than drugs.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Technology Shares Leading the Way in a Year-End Rally

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Technology stocks are leading a year-end rally that looks a lot like last year's. And as the last month of the year begins, the question is whether the rally will last long enough to make a major dent in the stock market's losses for the year.
 Since their lows for the year -- indeed, for more than five years -- on Oct. 9, the 2002 losses for the three main market gauges have been reduced by as much as 59 percent. The rally at the end of 2001, which came in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, cut the losses at the year's low on Sept. 21 by as much 70 percent for the three market gauges. 
 But even with a good December, the three main gauges could still be down for the year, which would be the first three-year decline for the stock market since 1939-41. 
In addition -- even with the rally since Oct. 9 -- both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are below the levels they rose to in August. Only the Nasdaq composite, which is the index most heavily weighted with technology stocks, has breached its Aug. 22 high.
Whether the rally continues will depend a great deal on how much the prospects for the economy improve, on the outlook for a war with Iraq and on the fight against terrorism.
It has been the surprising good news on the economy recently that has helped power the rally. Just in the last two weeks, new data have shown a rise in consumer confidence, a turnaround in two regional manufacturing indexes, an increase in orders for durable goods and a decline in initial claims for employment benefits. This improving outlook will be tested next week with the release on Monday of a national report on manufacturing in November and the November unemployment report on Friday. The strength of holiday retail sales will also be monitored closely.
On Dec. 8, Iraq is supposed to disclose the full inventory of its weapons. A failure to do so would violate the United Nations resolution on weapons inspection and increase the possibility of a war.
"I do think the economy is looking better and we are optimistic about the market over all," said Thomas McManus, equity strategist at Banc of America Securities.
In holiday-shortened trading that ended at 1 p.m. yesterday, stocks were little changed. The Dow fell 35.59 points, or 0.4 percent, to 8,896.09, but still finished up for the eighth consecutive week, rising 1 percent. This is the first positive eight-week run for the Dow since the first quarter of 1998. The Dow's loss for the year is 11.2 percent, down from 27.3 percent on Oct. 9.
The S.& P. 500 slipped 2.56 points, or 0.3 percent, to 936.31, but was up 0.6 percent for the week, its third consecutive rise and the seventh in the last eight weeks. The S.& P.'s loss for the year is 18.5 percent, down from 32.3 percent on Oct. 9.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 9.16 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,478.78, but rose 0.7 percent for the week, its third consecutive week of increases and the seventh week of gains in the last eight. The Nasdaq's loss for the year is 24.2 percent, down from 42.9 percent on Oct. 9.
The potency of the technology rally is reflected in the performance of the two big technology sectors that are part of the S.& P. 500-stock index. 
The information technology index, which includes the stocks of Cisco Systems, Dell Computer, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Intel, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems, is up 42.9 percent for October and November, surpassing the 37.4 percent rally in the corresponding two months last year. Since Oct. 9, this sector is up 48.9 percent.
The telecommunications services index, which includes the stocks of AT&T, BellSouth, Nextel Communications, Qwest Communications and Verizon Communications, is up 47.7 percent in the last two months, compared with a 12 percent decline in two-month period in 2001. Since Oct. 9 this sector is up 42.2 percent.
"The first thing to do is to downplay the significance of the percentage move off the bottom," Mr. McManus of Banc of America Securities said. "Is there anything more significant to that move than that technology was down a lot?"
Still, Mr. McManus said he was not avoiding technology stocks, only being cautious about them. His portfolio is only slightly underweight in such stocks.
Individual investors seem to be waking up to the jump in technology stocks. In the week ending Tuesday, $274 million flowed into technology stock funds, the largest weekly gain since $531 million in mid-April, according to AMG Data Services.
But over all, according to AMG's recent data, individual investors seemed more interested in foreign stocks and high-yield junk bonds. In the last week, $1.3 billion of the $3.5 billion that flowed into stock mutual funds went to funds investing mostly in stocks outside of the United States. At the same time, investors poured $731 million into mutual funds buying junk bonds.
Technology stocks are getting some of their lift, analysts say, not from stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings growth but from the hope that companies can now actually meet sharply lowered profit forecasts.
The Wall Street forecast for growth in the overall technology sector in the fourth quarter is 15 percent from the fourth quarter a year ago, according to Thomson First Call. But that forecast has fallen from 61 percent in April and 32 percent on Oct. 1, the beginning of the quarter.
The profit outlook for the first quarter of next year is also being reduced by Wall Street analysts. The current forecast is for earnings growth of 15 percent, compared with the period a year ago. That is down from an estimate of 28 percent on Oct. 1.
Chuck Hill, director of research at Thomson First Call, said the lower profit expectations told him that the technology rally might be overdone. "If you believe that tech is going to go through this big rebound, you are barking up the wrong tree," he said.
In the bond market, Treasury prices were a little higher as yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell. Still, the recent spate of positive economic data has made investors feel more optimistic about the outlook and pushed Treasury yields well above their recent lows. Yesterday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 4.22 percent in a half-day of trading, down from 4.26 percent Wednesday, but well above its 44-year low of 3.57 on Oct. 9.
