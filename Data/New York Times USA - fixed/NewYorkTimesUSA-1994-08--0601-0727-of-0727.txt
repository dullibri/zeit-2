HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: IN WASHINGTON;
U.S. Rejects Castro's Proposal for Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
A day after President Fidel Castro of Cuba proposed broad talks as a step toward ending the refugee crisis, the Clinton Administration rejected his overture, insisting that such talks would prove fruitless because Mr. Castro appears resolutely opposed to the reforms sought by Washington.
Even as many members of Congress urged President Clinton to agree to a high-level dialogue on the trade embargo, political reform and other points of contention, Administration officials insisted that such talks were unnecessary on the ground that Mr. Castro persists in blocking the changes he knows are needed to satisfy his people. 
 Mr. Clinton said late today that the only talks with Cuba that he favored were continuations of discussions on immigration issues. The United States has held low-level talks, usually twice a year, with Cuba on immigration matters since 1984 as a way of controlling the flow of Cubans and settling immigration disputes.
Mr. Clinton told reporters that the American people should not panic over the huge exodus of Cuban refugees, which has totaled more than 10,000 since last Friday. On that day, Mr. Clinton sought to slow the flow by ending a 28-year-old policy of admitting nearly all Cuban refugees.
"I would urge the American people to be firm and be calm about what is going on here now," he said. "We must not let any nation, even a nation as close to us as Cuba, even with so many American citizens of Cuban descent, control the immigration policy of the United States and violate the borders of the United States."
 
Fewer Picked Up Thursday
 The Coast Guard said 1,620 Cubans were picked up today in the Straits of Florida as of 10 P.M. Several officials said this might signal that the exodus was slowing because a total of 3,096 were picked up on Wednesday. An official said one reason for the drop-off was that bad weather might be temporarily slowing departures from Cuba.
At a White House news briefing, Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff presented the Administration's position in rebuffing Havana's calls for comprehensive talks with Cuba.
"Our position is that we are not going to enter into a dialogue with Castro or the Cuban Government over the pace and nature of change in Cuba," he said. "That is something that he is hearing every day, increasingly, from the Cuban people, and the people who are coming out are telling it more publicly than they did before. That's where the dialogue should take place."
Later in the day, Mr. Clinton said that Mr. Castro "needs to be in consultation with his own folks" and that "the people of Cuba want democracy and free markets."
 
Cost to Taxpayers
 For the first time, Pentagon officials estimated today what a continuing impasse would mean to the American taxpayer. They said it would cost $100 million to expand the capacity of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base to hold 45,000 refugees, and $20 million a month to feed and shelter them.
In a two-and-a-half hour appearance on Cuban television Wednesday night, Mr. Castro suggested that he might stop the exodus of refugees if the Administration agreed to direct talks on a range of issues, including Washington's 31-year-old trade embargo against Cuba.
"Solutions that are real, realistic and just would benefit the United States as well as us," said Mr. Castro, who took power in 1959.
The Cuban leader acknowledged that he had changed his policy on emigration two weeks ago, saying he told his Coast Guard to allow Cubans to leave freely on rafts.
Mr. Castro said the main factors fueling the exodus were the punitive trade embargo and Washington's failure to allow in more Cubans who apply for visas in Havana. He said these policies "compel illegal immigration," and he accused Washington of "creating a concentration camp" at Guantanamo Bay.
Mr. Tarnoff, who has become the Administration's coordinator on Cuba, had a harsh reaction to Mr. Castro's speech, saying: "Once again, there was an attempt by the Cuban leader to lay the responsibility for the crisis in Cuba at the foot of the United States. We simply reject that premise, and that is the reason that we do not believe it is useful to have a dialogue with Castro."
In rejecting a dialogue with Mr. Castro, the Administration is following the policy advocated by the Cuban-American National Foundation, the nation's most powerful Cuban-American organization, which favors a worldwide economic embargo of Cuba, rather than a dialogue.
 
Comments From Senators
 Even as many Cuban-Americans applauded the Administration's refusal to enter into broad talks with Havana, several members of Congress urged the President to pursue such talks.
Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, said: "Some open negotiations with Castro makes sense. It's anachronistic not to do it."
Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, one of the Republican Party's senior spokesmen on foreign policy, urged Mr. Clinton not to rule out using military force in dealing with Cuba.
"We have to indicate a great power cannot be trifled with," he said on Fox Morning News. "And in the event that Fidel Castro and others are prepared, really, to test the United States, we're prepared to strike back. And I would not rule out military force."
Administration officials said the Treasury Department would release new regulations on Friday further restricting travel and commerce with Cuba. One official said that under the new regulations, the Administration will, to a far greater degree than before, require Americans to obtain licenses to travel to Cuba or send money there.
To put more pressure on Mr. Castro, Mr. Clinton announced plans on Saturday to ban the flow of some $500 million that Cuban-Americans send each year to friends and relatives in Cuba. Under the new regulations, such remittances will be allowed only for emergencies and only after a license is received, an official said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed and Dow Falls After 2-Day Rally

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Almost as fast as the stock market's rally appeared, it disappeared. The leading stock indexes closed mixed yesterday, as a two-day surge of nearly 100 points on the Dow Jones industrial average failed to gather more steam.
The Dow, which had climbed on Tuesday and Wednesday, fell 16.84 points, to 3,829.89, yesterday. Some analysts said that rather than breaking out into a substantial rally, the market was simply establishing a new -- but higher -- trading range of 3,725 to 3,900 on the Dow. 
 "I'm not surprised that the market didn't follow through," said Dirk van Dijk, equity strategist at C. H. Dean & Associates, which manages $4 billion in stocks and fixed-income securities. "Frankly, I don't really see why it was so bloody giddy on Wednesday."
 
 
Mixed Factors
 Like the stock indexes, the factors that usually move the market were mixed yesterday. The dollar was up against the Japanese yen, which helped stocks, but down against the German mark, which hurt them.
Also depressing stocks was a decline in bond prices after the announcement of economic data, including jobless claims, whose strength might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again. Commodity prices were up slightly, which also might have hurt stocks.
But it also became more evident yesterday that the market's rally on Wednesday was something of a fluke, rather than a true change in the market's sentiment.
The rally may have been prompted in part by the unexpected consequences of a sophisticated hedging strategy devised by a single Wall Street firm, Loomis, Sayles & Company. The strategy involves a new kind of stock option called "flex options" and may have stampeded other stock traders into buying stocks in the last few hours of trading on Wednesday.
 
 
Nasdaq Index Gains
 But for the most part, much of the market held onto gains yesterday, while the Nasdaq over-the-counter market continued its rise. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 0.96 point, to 468.07. The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.43 point, to 258.18, with advancing stocks lagging declining stocks by 1,057 to 1,122. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.86 point, to 447.12. But the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index advanced 3.08 points, to 754.80.
The volume on the New York Stock Exchange was near normal, with 284 million shares changing hands, slightly below this year's daily average of 286 million shares.
The stocks that soared on Wednesday, including Caterpillar, International Paper and Eastman Kodak, headed down yesterday.
There were other notable stocks. Shares of Piper Jaffray, the Minneapolis stock brokerage firm, fell 2, to 11 5/8, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the firm could lose more than $700 million from investments in mortgage-backed securities.
America West Airlines, which had been under court supervision for the last three years, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection yesterday. Its stock rose 1/4, to 3 3/8, in active trading.
 
 
Novell Advances
 Shares of Novell, the computer-networking company that is closely followed by investors in high-technology stocks, rose 7/8, to 15 5/8. After the market had closed on Wednesday, Novell announced that its third-quarter earnings were lower than Wall Street's estimates, but the company planned to cut 1,750 jobs from a recent acquisition, Wordperfect, for a savings of at least $40 million.
Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 16 fell, led by Caterpillar, which dropped 2 3/8, to 112.
Of the 500 stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 259 fell, led by Wal-Mart, which fell 1/2, to 24 1/8, following its announcement that it might expand into Europe and Central America.
The most active stock, with 5.6 million shares traded, was Intel, which rose 15/16 , to 65 1/8. Dell Computer, whose products use Intel's microchips, reported higher second-quarter earnings. Dell is a direct-mail retailer of personal computers.

HEADLINE: Mexico Agains Calls U.S. Investors

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
The Mexicans have voted. Now it's the Americans' turn.
United States corporations and investors are poised for a new round of ventures in Mexico after the ruling party's recent victory in an election they regard as clean enough, at least, to be valid. 
 Mexican stocks have jumped, anticipating and then responding to the success of Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's presidential candidate. Corporate expansions and direct investments will come more gradually, however, since they take more than a phone call to arrange and can be much harder to reverse.
 
Dusting Off Proposals
 Already, though, the rustling and shuffling heard in many American corporate offices come from plans for Mexican investment being pulled out of the drawers and off the shelves where they had been put when the party, known as P.R.I., faltered early this year with the peasant rebellion in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas and the assassination of P.R.I.'s initial presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio.
"We were waiting to see the results of the election before we did anything,' said Sheila Gallagher, a spokeswoman for the Centex Corporation, the largest American home builder. Laurence E. Hirsch, Centex's chief executive, while refusing to describe his plans there, said, "An election that didn't elect the P.R.I. would have led one to wonder about the consequences."
The Mexican Government, although committed to free markets, has a far greater role in the economy than the United States Government, thereby making national elections that much more of a business issue. Just as ancient Romans reckoned periods of time by consulships, Mexican business people frame their long-range plans by the sexenio, the six-year presidential term.
Now, much more than before, Americans are planning for the coming sexenio as well. "Is the politics -- let's call it an opening -- going to keep moving in the same direction as the economic opening?" asked Hugo Verdegaal, the head of international corporate finance for Citibank in New York. "The election confirmed to a lot of people that is the case."
Mr. Verdegaal said that rather than reacting suddenly to the vote, American and Mexican corporations began to breathe more easily a few months ago as the P.R.I. began to recover from the peasant uprising and Mr. Colosio's assassination. Citibank now expects to help finance Government infrastructure projects, especially in electric power, that were put off until after the election.
United States investment in Mexico has grown rapidly in recent years, with a burst after Congress approved the North American Free Trade Agreement in November. Much new investment by American corporations is bound to be quiet, even furtive. They crank out news releases when they ship more products to Mexico, but not when they ship jobs.
The investment momentum slowed this year, but Jaime Alatorre, president of the Mexican Investment Board, expects a strong revival. Just this week, he and his staff began calling back American companies that in the last few months had postponed decisions on Government projects or investments of their own.
"Ports, power generation," he began in a phone interview, as if going down a list. "A number of them in textiles, garments. Those projects will be moving much faster. There are projects in the area of auto parts."
Some apparel work for American corporations will soon move to Mexico from Asia to qualify for the trade pact's tariff reductions on exports to the United States, he said. As for auto parts, the Big Three auto companies are asking suppliers to set up factories near the auto makers' Mexican assembly plants.
 
Hopeful About Reform
 American companies are encouraged not only by Mr. Zedillo's allegiance to current economic policies but also by the chances that he will revive other, stalled reforms. "That's a main topic: the Government itself delaying liberalization until after the elections," said Ronald J. Johansson, a partner in the Kenneth Leventhal & Company real estate consulting firm.
Despite opposition from the Mexican Legislature, the Government is already proposing to bundle home mortgages and sell them as investment securities. This step could vastly expand home ownership through more readily available mortgages, as well as create opportunities for American investors and financiers.
The American real estate and financial services industries could be among the first to see business improve, not only from reforms but also from rising business confidence. Mexican executives, after all, were at least as jittery as American executives in their country.
Eduardo Vidal, a partner with the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom law firm in New York, said he is leaving for Mexico next week to help two companies, including one building a water-treatment system for Cancun, raise money in the American markets. "That's the biggest thing we export: services," he said. "Lawyers, accountants, investment bankers."
Mexican companies seeking larger or more modern offices will find that even in Mexico City buildings with dependable elevators, air-conditioning and wiring for computers, phones and facsimile machines are scarce. Mr. Johansson speaks of one client, cautiously active in Mexico for a decade, who is now preparing to build office towers.
 
A Crowded Market
 Still, prospects in Mexico are not as bright as some companies believe. Many will find Mexican markets already crowded, particularly in fields like American-style retailing. Market research is primitive and income disparities are increasing, with doubts about just how many Mexicans can consume in a manner to which Americans are accustomed. To fend off kidnappers, Mexican business leaders must employ their own platoons of bodyguards.
Mark Robertson, the director of Cushman & Wakefield's real estate leasing partnership in Mexico, is resolutely upbeat, noting that the political fears raised by the Chiapas uprising and the assassination of Mr. Colosio have eased. But even he has some worries. "If the people in Chiapas wave their rifles up and down and pull their ski masks back on," he said, "those who have not made an investment may put it on hold."

HEADLINE: Apartheid's Arms-Maker Finds Respectability

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Talk about political baggage: This company armed the police who terrorized black townships. It helped white South Africa secretly make an atomic weapon. Its biggest export customer in sub-Saharan Africa was the former regime in Rwanda. It flouted international arms-trafficking sanctions.
For Armscor, the Armaments Corporation of South Africa, fitting into the gentler, democratic South Africa of Nelson Mandela would seem to require a tour de force of political dexterity. 
 And that is exactly what the weapons industry here has undertaken, recasting itself as a people-friendly generator of jobs and technology, a proponent of openness and international law, and a linchpin of the Government's social uplift program.
"Watch it spread the pollen and make the honey," Armscor says of the industry it bestrides, in a new advertising campaign that features plump, cartoon honeybees flitting over a field of daisies.
Already the South African weapons industry, for which Armscor is the main conduit, has won over prominent veterans of the liberation movement, who have discovered that weapons seem less repugnant when they are your own.
 
Backed by Defense Minister
 The most enthusiastic booster is Joe Modise, the former African National Congress guerrilla leader who is now Minister of Defense. But President Mandela has also conferred his slightly more ambiguous blessing on the industry's plans to aggressively increase foreign arms sales.
The fate of the arms industry has sharply divided Mr. Mandela's party, where many new officials favor diverting money from the military budget for housing and schools, and some are dismayed at the notion of a worldwide weapons trade bearing the Nelson Mandela seal of approval.
"Couldn't we produce something else that is not deadly?" asked Thenjiwe Mtintso, a former anti-apartheid guerrilla who now sits on the parliamentary committee overseeing the military, where she questions both the morality and economic trickle-down of making weapons.
On Saturday, Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu chided Mr. Mandela, his fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, for not moving to dismantle Armscor and curtail the weapons trade.
"Our President could easily become the target of demonstrations and pickets, and we cannot keep quiet," he told a church gathering.
The last few years have been rough on South African arms- makers, a tight-knit network of contractors public and private, with Government-owned Armscor at its hub.
Armscor manufactures nothing itself -- not since its production arm was spun off two years ago as a separate, state-owned conglomerate called Denel, which sells everything from bullets and grenades to tank turrets and combat helicopters.
Overseen by a board appointed by the Defense Minister, Armscor now is an acquisitions company. It purchases weapons for the army and police, cultivates the domestic industry with planning and technical advice, and licenses all arms exports. No legal arms trade takes place without its involvement.
 
Arms Spending Cut
 Since South Africa withdrew its army in 1988 from Angola, where it was fighting to overthrow the Cuban-backed Government, Pretoria has cut its weapons spending more than 40 percent. Where the old Armscor employed 27,000 people, its offspring, Armscor and Denel, now employ about 15,000.
While military spending is growing -- in Mr. Mandela's first budget, it is to increase 10 percent, to about $3.3 billion -- the new money is paying to merge the old defense force with former guerrillas and black homeland armies, not to buy weapons.
The industry's first solution has been to turn to foreign customers.
Despite United Nations sanctions against the apartheid government, South Africa built a formidable weapons industry that is the country's largest exporter of manufactured goods, with more than $150 million in foreign sales last year.
The largest customers are Middle Eastern countries like Oman and Dubai, which buy artillery and armored vehicles. South Africa also sells technology to the Far East, and small arms to South America.
 
Rise in Export Trade
 With sanctions lifted last May, said Tielman de Waal, the executive general manager of Armscor, South African exports, now about half a percent of the world market, are expected to double by the end of the year, and then quickly double again.
The most rapid growth is expected to be in the neighboring states of southern Africa, where Armscor will arrange the servicing and eventual replacement of old weapons supplied by the Soviet bloc.
"These are our natural markets, because we're close by and we have a pretty good reputation for quality," said Brigadier William Suss, senior researcher at the Institute for Defense Policy, a Johannesburg research organization. "If you were on the receiving end at one stage, you are easily convinced how effective these weapons are."
Although industry officials say they have little hope of capturing much business in the advanced and well-protected Western markets, South African weapons are enjoying a new-found respectability there too.
One major impediment is the United States, which has retained a ban on importing and exporting South African weapons because Armscor and affiliated companies are under indictment for smuggling out American components to circumvent sanctions against South Africa and Iraq.
Armscor has offered to pay large fines to dispose of the case, and industry officials say the reason Americans have refused a deal is that they want to protect American weapons-makers from new competition.
 
Civilian Production an Option
 Another front in the industry's survival plan is Mr. Mandela's war against poverty.
Armscor officials said they had approached Government ministries and provincial officials proposing that Armscor become an official acquisition agent for purchases of medical equipment, vehicles, water purification systems, electrical generators and other goods.
As it did with weapons, Armscor would nurture domestic manufacturers for these products, which could then be exported, creating jobs. Much of the work, in fact, would logically go to weapons companies, officials said, since swords and ploughshares are often not so different.
"What is a tent but a low-cost housing system?" said Andre Buys, the head of the Armscor planning department.
Most weapons-makers have already diversified beyond armaments. Even at Denel, which until recently was banned from non-military work, about 14 percent of production is now commercial, ranging from composite pipe to cricket bats.
Armscor said its overtures to Government officials have been warmly received, although there is also suspicion, not only from military critics but also from some private companies who worry that Armscor and its siblings will become state-sponsored competitors.
"There is a feeling in industry that the playing field is not entirely level," said William P. Venter, executive chairman of Allied Electronics Corporation, a major producer of civilian and military technology.
 
A New Beginning?
 Armscor is adamant that it has turned over a new leaf, and should be forgiven its past.
"It is true that the armaments industry was developed under the system of apartheid," said Mr. de Waal. "Is that a reason to deny its contribution to the gross domestic product?"
Company officials say they now respect international agreements limiting the spread of arms. Mr. de Waal said the company will happily abide by decisions of the Mandela Government not to permit arms sales to dictators or countries facing civil wars, and will support fuller disclosure of the secretive arms budget.
The company announced it was halting export of land mines, which are blamed for thousands of civilian casualties. A $60 million shipment of guns, ammunition and grenades to Rwanda was canceled after the Government began massacring the Tutsi ethnic minority.
Armscor began courting congress leaders more than two years ago, meeting with Mr. Modise and other anti-apartheid activists.
 
Anti-Apartheid Writer Hired
 In May the company hired Enoch Sithole, until recently the star political writer for The New Nation, an ardently pro-congress weekly newspaper, as its chief lobbyist.
"I've written various articles against this company," Mr. Sithole said. "But they assured me they want to work with the new Government. It's not that I am an ardent supporter of producing and exporting armaments, but if such activity is practiced at all in the world, there's no reason South Africa shouldn't."
Jacklyn Cock, a sociologist and leader of the Military Research Group, which advises military critics in Parliament, said opponents of the military industry are heavily out-gunned in the new Government by the odd new "militarist alliance" of white officers from the apartheid army and black guerrillas from the anti-apartheid struggle.
But while that may win the industry official support for its overseas ventures, it is not likely to protect the domestic arms budget from further cutting, said Brigadier Suss.
"No matter how much support Armscor has in the Cabinet," he said, "the fact remains that in the long run you will always have four corvettes for the Navy and not a new hospital, or 60 Pilatus aircraft and not schools. It will always remain a problem of how much money you are prepared to spend."

HEADLINE: Toyota Profit Declines for A 4th Year

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 25

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation, hurt by the strong yen and a weak Japanese car market, today reported its fourth consecutive annual decline in profits, with net income falling to the lowest level in at least a decade.
But Japan's largest and richest automobile company also said it thought the worst was over, and predicted that sales and profits would rise in the coming year. 
 For the fiscal year that ended on June 30, Toyota's consolidated net income fell 28.7 percent, to 125.8 billion yen, or $1.27 billion when converted at a rate of 99 yen to the dollar. The figure is only slightly more than a quarter of the 441.3 billion yen income reported in Toyota's peak year, which ended in June 1990.
 
 
 
Revenues Fall 8.3%
 Toyota's revenues fell 8.3 percent, to 9.36 trillion yen, or $94.6 billion, the first decline since 1986.
Worldwide vehicle sales fell 7.5 percent, to 4.13 million units. Sales in Japan, the company's largest market, fell 6.9 percent, to 2.01 million units; overseas sales fell 8.1 percent, to 2.12 million vehicles.
Toyota did not get much help from the United States, where the auto market has been strong. From January through July, its sales in terms of vehicles sold were up only 2 percent, compared with a rise of 9 percent for the market as a whole.
By contrast, the Honda Motor Company reported on Wednesday a big gain in quarterly profits, in part because of buoyant sales in the United States. Nissan is also seeing strong growth in the American market. Unlike its two Japanese rivals, Toyota has no prominent new products to spur its American sales.
Still, Toyota avoided what it feared most -- a loss. Last year at this time, with the dollar just above 100 yen, Toyota had said it might face its first operating loss in the fiscal year 1994.
Like other Japanese companies, Toyota has been shifting its manufacturing abroad, partly to cope with the strong yen. But that means that production in Japan has been dropping, leaving a problem of overcapacity.
 
 
 
Program to Cut Costs
 Toyota is in the midst of a cost-cutting binge, and said it achieved savings of 150 billion yen, or about $1.5 billion, in the last year. It expects to cut another 100 billion yen, or $1 billion, in the coming year. Most of the savings have come from changes in the design of its cars, with the rest coming from cost-cutting in manufacturing and distribution.
Total vehicle sales in Japan have declined for three years and may decline this year as well. But there are growing signs that Japan is pulling out of its long recession and that the sales slump may be ending.
Toyota also announced that it would change to a fiscal year ending on March 31, to conform with the practice of most Japanese companies. That means its current fiscal year, which began in July, will last only nine months.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Cuba Strain Cools Haiti's Invasion Fever

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Aug. 25

 BODY:
The red-and-blue banners that stretch across main streets in Port-au-Prince read, "No to the U.S. invasion." But the colors are beginning to fade after being up for more than a month, because the likelihood of such an invasion to reinstate the deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, seems to have grown dimmer for many Haitians.
The State Department's attention in the region seems to be focused on Cuba, and what Haitians once called invasion fever seems to have broken. 
 Though United States warships still sit off Haiti as part of a United Nations embargo that continues to squeeze the economy, Haitians who once said "when" in relation to the invasion are now saying "if."
Stanley Schrager, spokesman for the United States Embassy here, said that Washington's resolve in Haiti had not weakened and that there was still only one acceptable resolution to the political stalemate: for the military-backed leadership to step down, making way for Father Aristide to return to power.
But to his supporters, what seems to be Washington's preoccupation with Cuba is bad news, and gives the Haitian military exactly what it wants: more time to wait out the sanctions and to wait for Father's Aristide's term to expire in 1996.
After nearly three years of oppression and broken promises by the Haitian authorities, the Clinton Administration's talk of an invasion gave some Aristide supporters hope that the exit of the military leaders would be hastened. Now that feeling of optimism fades with every headline about Cubans fleeing their country, said one supporter of Father Aristide.
"It is like the U.S. can only solve one problem at a time," a young woman said.
She said she was willing to suffer under the embargo, to eat less, walk everywhere she goes, even risk the killings of the poor people that continue to leave back roads dotted with corpses, as long as there was some end in sight. But Washington, she asserted, is behaving like a bully, taunting one child, threatening to fight, but running away just to taunt another child.
"I feel sorry for the Cubans who are suffering," she said, "but I don't believe they are suffering as much as we are."
In the meantime, Haiti's military continues to conduct drills with a civilian militia and to talk of repelling an invasion by the United States. Last week, it paraded a new unit, armed only with machetes, past the presidential palace.
For those in power, Washington's confrontation with Cuba could not have come at a better time, some Haitians said. Foreign journalists, who chronicled the abuses suffered by Haitians, have left the country by the dozens in the last few weeks, many seeking visas to Cuba.
The hardships of the embargo, however, do not reach into the military barracks or the headquarters where Lieut. Gen. Raul Cedras and his colleagues seem prepared to wait it out indefinitely since coming to power in a coup in September 1991.
One man who voted for Father Aristide said, "If you do see someone wading ashore, it won't be the marines." It would be some lost Cuban, he said.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: IN MIAMI;
Cuban Group Forges Link to Clinton

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 25

 BODY:
For the moment at least, the refugee exodus from Cuba has given Jorge Mas Canosa, a longtime supporter of Republican Presidents, access to the inner circles of a Democratic White House.
Mr. Mas, president of the Cuban American National Foundation and an enthusiastic supporter of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, today praised President Clinton's revised policies on Cuba, policies Mr. Mas had a hand in shaping in a meeting with Mr. Clinton last Friday. 
 "He's a man who stands for democracy and freedom," Mr. Mas said in an interview today. "What the President did has nothing to do with politics; it came out of his own convictions. He took the initiative on a policy based on principle."
As much as he admired former Presidents Reagan and Bush, Mr. Mas said, "they never took a stand against Castro the way Mr. Clinton has, despite all their rhetoric."
 
Welcomes Castro's Criticism
 The President's action had long been sought by Mr. Mas and his foundation, a group of wealthy Cuban business leaders in Miami. Mr. Clinton's order established that Mr. Mas once again had the ear of a President and was in a position to push a hard line against Fidel Castro's attempts to form a new accommodation with Washington over the United States economic embargo and other matters.
The Cuban leader, in a long televised talk from Havana on Wednesday night, mentioned Mr. Mas and the Cuban American National Foundation several times, calling them "fascist mafia," an appellation that Mr. Mas today seemed almost comforted by.
"It shows that what we are doing has hurt him," Mr. Mas said. "He put me in good company with Mr. Clinton and the foundation with the U.S. Government."
In announcing that he was halting cash transfers to Cuba and curtailing charter flights to the island, Mr. Clinton was reversing course. Last year, over the opposition of the foundation, Mr. Clinton expanded programs to relieve hardships imposed on the Cuban people by the deterioration of economic conditions in a Communist government no longer subsidized by Moscow.
 
Tensions Easing in Miami
 Mr. Mas also endorsed the Administration's order that all refugees be held in detention until democracy is instituted in Cuba, reversing a longstanding policy of granting political asylum to most Cubans who reach the United States. His concerns over the order were allayed by White House agreement that the President would "punish" Mr. Castro for allowing the refugees to depart Cuba through the new curtailments on cash and travel. Mr. Mas's support helped turn around the initial outrage expressed by Cuban-Americans who believed the rafters were being betrayed.
Mr. Mas was also unstinting in his praise of Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, who invited Mr. Mas to last Friday's meeting with the President in the Cabinet Room of the White House. This development must be particularly unsettling to Republicans who had come to rely on partisan support from Mr. Mas and generous campaign contributions from the foundation's millionaires.
The candidate most upset must be Jeb Bush, the former President's son, who has been seen as the foundation's favorite in the Republican primary in September to choose an opponent of Mr. Chiles in his bid for re-election this fall.
Mr. Mas, a hard-driving man who fled to Miami in 1960 and later established a successful engineering and construction concern, was among five Miami civic and government leaders invited by Governor Chiles to discuss the growing refugee crisis with the President.
 
Meeting Not Contentious
 Mr. Chiles, in a telephone interview today, said Mr. Mas had not pushed his views with the President to the exclusion of the opinions of others in the group. "I believe everyone there was all united that Castro was the problem," he said. "The meeting was never one of contention. Mas Canosa wanted a full blockade right away and the President said he would not take it off the table but it was not something he would consider right now."
Like two old warhorses, Mr. Mas and Mr. Castro have been at each other's throats for years. When Mr. Mas received Washington's backing for Radio Marti in 1986 to broadcast to Cuba, and later obtained Congressional financing for Television Marti, relations between the two countries were chilled after years of growing accommodation.
Mr. Mas talked about Mr. Castro's Wednesday night speech with the growl of someone who smells victory.
"Castro has been a pretty good offensive machine," Mr. Mas said, "but last night on television he was rambling around and -- for him -- left speechless.
"President Clinton stood up to him and it was Castro who blinked," he continued, savoring the sight of an old adversary groping for words to describe Washington's refusal to accept a new round of refugees.
"Castro probably has played one of his last cards and Clinton stole the initiative away," Mr. Mas said. "He outsmarted Castro."
 
Not at Point of Invasion
 The game plan now, he continued, is to wait and see if the most desperate Cubans, aware now that Mr. Clinton will not permit them to enter the United States, will remain home and work for Mr Castro's removal.
"Mr. Clinton has to be prudent and continue monitoring the situation," Mr. Mas said, ruling out negotiations with Havana that would provide Mr. Castro the means to stay in power.
Asked if he favored an invasion of Cuba by exiles and refugees armed and supported by the United States military, Mr. Mas replied, "We have not reached that point yet."
He and most Cuban-Americans supported a United States blockade of Cuba, which he said could deplete the island's fuel reserves within three months and cause political collapse sometime after.
"It's a very viable option which I think the President has close to his heart," he said. "He gave us all encouragement and it is being seriously considered. But first we must see how the new restrictions on travel and cash transfers work out."
 
Looking for One Departure
 He said he was sad for the rafters who face a long time in detention in Miami and the Navy's Guantanamo Bay base in Cuba, "but most important to us are the 11 million people still in Cuba."
"We can't spend our life taking care of rafters and diverting our attention from Cuba," he said.
He paused a moment and said: "You know, a solution doesn't take the exit of thousands of rafters. It takes the exit of only one man and his name is Fidel Castro. But he'll never leave peacefully.
"I'm asked if I promote bloodshed in Cuba. I would like to see a peaceful, nonviolent civilized transition to democracy. No one wants blood. But it will be Castro's responsibility to see it doesn't happen.
"But what he is promoting is violence on the Cuban people."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Give Up Most of Their Gains

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday, giving back nearly all of the previous day's gains, as traders were concerned that an economic report today would show that the economy has not slowed that much.
Chris Moore, a senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data in Boston, said it was obvious that the market was worried about today's revised report on the second-quarter gross domestic product, which is likely to show a growth rate stronger than the previously released 3.7 percent. He expects the number will be about 4 percent. Many analysts fear that the report will suggest that inflation pressures are still building. 
 "The concern was confirmed by the selling that took the market out of its pre-auction levels and buoyed rates toward the highs of the week again," Mr. Moore said.
Bond prices dipped slightly in early trading, and managed to hold onto most of Wednesday's gains into the afternoon, helped by a firmer dollar in the currency markets. But by late in the day, the price of the 30-year bond had fallen 29/32 , to 9920/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 7.53 percent, from 7.46 percent on Wednesday.
The bond market shrugged off two economic reports that were released yesterday.
The National Association of Realtors said existing-home sales fell three-tenths of 1 percent in July, to 3.95 million units annualized, in line with expectations and generally consistent with the cooling off in the housing market in recent months.
The relatively flat existing-home sales report included gains of 2.4 percent in the West and a 1 percent decline in the Midwest, while the Northeast dropped 4.8 percent and the South dipped seven-tenths of 1 percent. The report also noted that the median price of a home fell to $111,500, from $112,800 in June. But economists see the existing-home sales report as a bit of a lagqard, because the figures are based on a mix of contract signings and closings, with new-home sales just contract signings, so they say that it just does not carry much weight with the market.
In a separate report yesterday, jobless claims fell 3,000, to 322,000 for the week ended Aug 20, in line with expectations. Traders said a Reuters survey of economists had predicted the number would come in at 329,000. Analysts said the unemployment claims continue to disclose strength in the employment market, an indication that will be tested by next Friday's August employment report.
"Existing-home sales showed that the Fed's higher interest rate policy is having its desired effect on the pace of U.S.'s improving economy," Mr. Moore said, "while the lower claims report was indicative of a healthy economy," which, he added, was capable of "sustaining a recovery in a rising interest rate environment."
Mr. Moore said market expectations for today's revised G.D.P. ranged from 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent. He said the G.D.P. number could be the catalyst to push the long end of the market up to 7.75 percent, which is the the ceiling of its trading range since April.
Elsewhere in the municipal bond market, the decline was not as bad since many investors bought bonds to hedge against higher taxes and also because this year there were fewer new issues.

HEADLINE: A Back-to-Basics U-Turn in Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOYOTA CITY, Japan

 BODY:
As part of its quality testing, the Toyota Motor Corporation used to require that sunroofs on its automobiles be opened and closed 1,500 times in a room cooled to 22 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. Then it occurred to the company that few people opened their sunroofs even once when it was that cold outside.
To cut costs, the required testing has been reduced to 500 times at a temperature of only 4 degrees below zero. 
 The modification might seem trivial, but it is part of a broader change of mind-set that is sweeping through Japan's largest car company and through the rest of the nation's auto industry. After years of building fancier and more expensive cars, Japanese auto makers are being forced to move back toward less expensive vehicles with fewer frills and less obsessive attention to detail, a shift that they contend will not compromise basic quality or reliability.
"With excessive standards, we designed over-engineered cars," said Akihiro Wada, a senior managing director at Toyota. A few years ago, he said, "we had a philosophy that as long as we made good-quality vehicles, no matter how expensive they were, people would be satisfied."
Now, however, the first expression out of a Japanese auto executive's mouth is likely to be "value for money." In a sense, Japan's automobile companies, which first made their mark with low-priced but reliable vehicles, are returning to their roots.
The new philosophy has found its expression in a series of relatively inexpensive vehicles that have been introduced in Japan in the last few months and have done quite well.
Toyota's new small sport-utility vehicle, known as the RAV 4 and made on a lightly automated assembly line here, is considered to be the first embodiment of the new approach by Japan's largest car company. Other newly introduced inexpensive cars that have done well include Mazda's Familia, known in the United States as the Protege, and some versions of Nissan's Sunny, known as the Sentra in the United States.
The auto companies are reacting to changes in Japan's automobile market. Sales of new cars here have declined for three years, though there are signs that the downturn is ending. With Japan still in an economic slump, people here are looking for less expensive cars than they sought during the boom of the so-called bubble economy in the late 1980's.
But the same lessons will be applied to the models sold abroad, where Japanese cars, especially at the low end of the market, have become less competitive in the last two years, in part because the Japanese yen has become more expensive in relation to the dollar. The cost-trimming may become apparent with the redesigned 1995 Mazda Protege and the 1996 Honda Civic.
"Now the Japanese are realizing that despite the yen being at 98, they still have to have a substantial presence in the low-priced car market," said Chris W. Cedergren, senior vice president of Auto Pacific Inc., a consulting firm in Santa Ana, Calif. He said that while Japanese small cars were at least $1,500 more expensive than comparable American models, the new models to be introduced starting next year would erase the price gap.
 
 
 
A Jolt of 'Neon Shock'
 In the American market, Japanese auto makers took their eye off the low end as they moved into luxury and sports cars. In part, that was because voluntary restraints on Japan's exports to the United States in the 1980's encouraged the companies to use their limited allotment to sell expensive cars, not low-priced ones.
But now, the markets for luxury and sports cars are sluggish. And Detroit, helped by the rising yen and its own revamping, has mounted a new attack at the low end with cars like Chrysler's Neon.
"We had what we call Neon shock," said Luke Bierens, an engineer at the factory here in the city where Toyota has its headquarters and where the RAV 4 is built. He said that when engineers took apart the new Chrysler subcompact, they found Toyota used as many as 10 components in places where Chrysler used one.
Another reason for a return to basics is that much of the new demand for motor vehicles will come from developing nations in Asia and Latin America, where most people cannot afford expensive cars.
Whether Japan can still compete in the low end of the market is open to question. Some of the new inexpensive cars achieve their lower prices not only through true cost-cutting, but also by leaving out popular equipment like radios or air-conditioners.
Many executives and analysts here say it will be difficult or impossible to cut costs enough to make Japan's exports competitive at 100 or 95 yen to the dollar, especially with Japan's tradition of lifetime employment. That means manufacturing will continue to shift to the United States and other countries.
 
 
 
Danger of Cutting Too Much
 Moreover, there is a risk that skimping too much could undermine the Japanese industry's most precious asset: the reputation for reliability that gave Japanese cars an edge in the United States.
"I'm afraid the quality will be less," said Akira Oshikawa, an independent industry analyst and former official of the Japan Auto Parts Industries Association.
But auto officials insist that they will retain the quality. "We are not lowering the standard for the customer," Mr. Wada of Toyota said. "We are just lowering the excesses."
To cut costs, companies are reducing the number of models they offer and the number of varieties of each car. Japanese car companies offer dozens of steering wheels for some models in their home market in an effort to satisfy each customer's preference, an option they are limiting.
For instance, for the new Camry introduced in Japan this year, Toyota is offering only 44 possible variations of models and basic equipment, compared with 66 for the previous Camry. The total number of parts in the car dropped to 2,300 from 3,900.
Other cost savings will be achieved by sharing parts among different models rather than designing each part from scratch, from revamping the research and development process and pressing the parts suppliers for lower prices.
Because it takes four years to develop and build a new model, and the cost-cutting efforts have been under way in earnest for only two years, the full results have not yet been seen. But some of the models coming out achieve partial cost savings.
 
 
 
Sorry, No Radio
 The new Mazda Familia has a base price of 970,000 yen, or $9,700, which in Japan is inexpensive. The new cars are priced about $300 to $900 less than the previous generation of Familias. The company achieved the lower price by reducing the number of models offered, making parts common to different models and eliminating some features, like the radio, in the basic model.
In the United States, the same Mazda car, known as the Protege, is going on sale at prices starting at $12,000. The list price will range from the same to $400 less than the previous model, despite the yen's rise.
Nissan has developed a new two-door version of its low-end Sunny, with a base price of less than 900,000 yen, or $9,000. On Aug. 24, it introduced a new Cefiro sedan, a mid- to high-range car, at prices 5 percent lower than the previous generation's.
Nissan has not announced the price for either car in the United States, where they will go on sale next year. But it has been aggressive in pricing other models in North America.
The base model of the new Nissan Maxima, which was introduced this year, costs at least 6 percent below the price of the previous Maxima, despite the fact that it is being exported from Japan while the yen is strong.
Some American critics contend that Nissan is "dumping" cars -- selling them below cost to gain market share. Nissan said it had cut costs by sharing the Maxima's platform with another model, changing to a simpler suspension and eliminating frills like a keyless locking system.
 
 
 
A Low-Priced Hit
 But the most-talked-about vehicle in the new low-price category is Toyota's RAV 4, considered one of Japan's first "post bubble" automobiles. It has a base price in Japan of 1.6 million yen, or $16,000, compared with prices of at least 2 million yen, or $20,000, for most larger sport-utility vehicles.
Toyota has been selling more than 5,000 of the vehicles a month since the RAV 4 was introduced in May, far exceeding its monthly target of 2,000 units. Orders from Japanese buyers have backed up into November. The vehicle is also being exported to Western Europe, and Toyota is considering whether to produce it in the United States. As an import, the RAV 4 would face a 25 percent American tariff because it would be classified as a truck.
The basic model has no air-conditioner, no tilt steering wheel, and only an AM radio. There are fewer alternatives offered than in the past -- only 10 steering wheel choices, for instance.
Many parts are shared with other Toyota models. The steering wheels come from the Celica; the buttons for optional power windows from the Corolla, and the engine, transmission and front suspension from the Japanese version of the Camry. In all, 20 to 30 percent of the car's components are shared with other vehicles, said Keiichi Kanda, a manager at the Motomachi plant, where the RAV 4 is made. Ten years ago, Mr. Kanda said, there was almost no sharing of components among models.
 
 
 
Simpler Assembly Process
 Costs have also been cut by simplifying the assembly line, which is not as automated as those in some plants built by Toyota in the late 1980's, when the auto maker was bedazzled by technology and the cost savings it promised.
"We went along with the cover story," said Mikio Kitano, the manager of the Motomachi plant and a Toyota director. "We tried to do everything by machine." But the savings proved elusive, he said, because the equipment cost so much.
The less complex RAV 4 assembly line cost only a third as much to build as the one in Toyota's most automated factory, the Tahara plant. Truck-type models also tend to be less expensive to assemble than the more elaborate luxury automobiles.
At Tahara, where the Lexus is made, Toyota tried to use machine-vision systems to guide robots in aligning the tires so the lug nuts could be fastened. Here at Motomachi, a round piece of plastic juts out of the center of the wheels. The big hole in the tire's center slides onto the piece of plastic, guiding the tire into place.
And while at some modern factories, cars ride on special dollies that can be raised or lowered depending on the task to be performed, at Motomachi it is the height of the workers that is adjusted, by raising wooden platforms on the floor.

Diagram: "Controlling Costs To Compete Better"
 Japanese auto companies are going back to their roots by using parts common to several models to reduce development and manufacturing costs and taking out luxury features to create cars they hope can compete in the low-end market. Manufacturers are also building less-automated assemblylines and changing their product tests in an effort to control costs. Changes in Toyota's new RAV 4,right which is available only in Japan thus far, reflect this approach. (Source: Toyota Motor Corp.)

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Against Yen As Optimism on Trade Rises

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Signs that negotiators from the United States and Japan were making progress on trade issues helped to lift the dollar against the yen yesterday.
But the dollar fell against the mark and other leading currencies after a German Government report showed a surprising surge in that country's inflation. The increased prompted speculation that the Bundesbank would stop lowering interest rates, or would even raise them, to control inflation. 
 American and Japanese negotiators engaged in positive discussions aimed at opening Japan's insurance market to foreign companies, according to a Japanese Finance Ministry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
 
 
'Sense of Optimism'
 The talks on insurance are part of the so-called framework talks on ways to reduce Japan's $60 billion annual trade surplus with the United States, which many traders and analysts regard as the true source of the yen's strength.
"There is a sense of optimism that the U.S. and Japan will make progress in this month's trade talks," said Michael Faust, a portfolio manager at Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., money manager with $1 billion on assets.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 99.65 yen, up from 99.01 yen on Wednesday, its third gain this week. The dollar fell to 1.5423 marks, from 1.5473 marks on Wednesday.
The dollar started rising in Tokyo trading after the Bank of Japan bought dollars for a third day, traders said. The central bank often intervenes to keep the yen from rising because a too-strong yen hurts Japanese exporters.
 
 
Inflation in Western Germany
 Those gains, however, failed to support the dollar against the mark. The dollar fell against the mark after the German Government said inflation in western Germany rose a bigger-than-expected 3 percent in August from a year earlier.
The dollar fell further after Guntram Palm, a member of the Bundesbank's policy making council, said the central bank could start raising interest rates if money supply growth continued to exceed targets. Germany's money supply grew 9.9 percent in July, above the Bundesbank's target range of 4 to 6 percent.
Some traders were skeptical that the Bundesbank would raise rates abruptly after lowering them for almost two years. In any case, the central bank was unlikely to make any move until after parliamentary elections on Oct. 16, they said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
An argument over magazine research is causing concern among marketers and agencies.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
A DISPUTE over magazine research methodology is roiling agencies, advertisers, media executives and researchers. They are becoming increasingly concerned that the quarrel could call into question the validity of data used to buy billions of dollars worth of print advertisements annually.
The dispute involves a once-confidential draft report by members of a committee of the Magazine Publishers of America, the trade organization representing the nation's magazine industry. The draft report questioned the way some data are compiled by the Simmons Market Research Bureau, one of the two companies that conduct research among consumers to determine which magazines and newspapers they read, how often they read those publications and how much time they spend reading each issue. 
 The draft report, in examining research of Simmons and its rival, Mediamark Research Inc., concluded that the basis for data reported by Simmons after 1990, when it changed how its surveys were conducted, was perplexing. Specifically, the draft report questioned how Simmons surveys from 1991 through 1993 found a steep decline in potential readers of magazines -- or "screens" in the language of media research.
The draft report declared this puzzling because, at the same time, the Simmons research found that the number of full-time readers, or "reads," had suffered no corresponding decline. Such a divergence between the two sets of figures is unusual.
Simmons went on the offensive after articles about the draft report appeared last month in Inside Research, a newsletter, and Inside Media, a trade publication.
"We have always tried to work with any client or association that wants to look at our data," Ellen Cohen, president at Simmons in New York, said yesterday.
"But this was mishandled," she added. "If you get confidential information and you leak it, you stop being professional."
James R. Guthrie, executive vice president for marketing development at the publishers association in New York, said he believed that complaints about a breach of confidentiality were "a convenient red herring."
Putting aside the he-said, she-said aspects of the contretemps, it does raise some significant issues.
"We need to make sure the industry has good data," said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the American Association of Advertising Agencies. That organization, known as the Four A's, is the agency industry counterpart of the publishers association. The media departments at member agencies use Simmons and Mediamark data as the basis for deciding which publications to buy advertising space in -- and which to withhold their dollars from.
"The data used to make buying decisions need to be reliable and accepted on a broad-scale basis," Mr. Drake said, "so this is naturally of concern to us."
John Motavalli, editor at Inside Media in New York, said the draft report raised another important question.
"If Simmons's numbers turn out to be very badly flawed, and become unacceptable, the only source of data," he said, would be Mediamark. "And there would be a single source of research in magazines the way in TV the only source is Nielsen."
That would be problematic, he added, because "agencies should have a multiplicity of facts" when making decisions as crucial as allocating print advertising budgets.
Mr. Guthrie agreed that it "would not be in our interest at all to have one of the services on the ropes or out of business, because a monopoly situation only cuts down on your options."
The Four A's is seeking to quell the dispute by inviting executives from the publishers association, Simmons and Mediamark to a meeting in New York on Sept. 23.
"We're serving as a facilitator for what we view as a fact-finding meeting," Mr. Drake said, "to give the parties an opportunity to present their points of view."
All those invited have agreed to attend, along with executives of the Advertising Research Foundation, which establishes standards for ad research. Mr. Guthrie, in a letter sent on Wednesday to that organization, asked its executives to review the draft report.
"Our hope is that the A.R.F. will supervise any further action it believes should be taken," Mr. Guthrie wrote in his letter, a copy of which he read yesterday. "A.R.F. is the appropriate body for further discussion."
Michael J. Naples, president of the research foundation, said that he would "get the right parties together to take a look at it and decide what to do."
"If it comes down to assessing an individual commercial firm, that isn't something we do," he added. "We need to see if it's generalizable as an industry issue, if there's something we can do that's constructive."

HEADLINE: Initial Claims By Jobless Fall

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Fewer Americans applied for first-time state unemployment benefits last week than any week since July, the Labor Department said today.
The four-week moving average, a less volatile representation of the underlying labor market than the weekly totals, declined for the fifth week in a row and was at the lowest level since Dec. 25, 1993. 
 "There is not anything surprising in the report, but claims do remain subdued and they suggest the labor market is fairly healthy," said David Sloan, senior economist at IDEA Inc.
The Labor Department said new claims in the week that ended last Saturday fell to 322,000 from a revised 325,000 the previous week. It was the lowest level since the last week of July, when the level of claims was 315,000.

HEADLINE: Home-Resale Drop Posted

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes fell for the third straight month in July as demand for housing continued to be hurt by rising interest rates, a real estate trade group said today.
The group, the National Association of Realtors, said sales of existing single-family homes dipped three-tenths of 1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.95 million. 
 The July decline followed drops of 3.6 percent in June and three-tenths of 1 percent in May. Since January, sales of previously owned homes have fallen in five out of seven months as demand has been hurt by rising interest rates that were initiated when the Federal Reserve began tightening credit to ward off inflationary pressures.
Still, industry executives noted that the July sales pace was 2.6 percent higher than it was a year ago and that even with the rise in rates, mortgages were at relatively low levels, especially compared with the mid-1980's.
The national median price for an existing single-family home was $111,500 in July, down 1.2 percent from a median price of $112,800 in June. The median is the midpoint where half the homes cost more and half cost less.
The biggest decline was in the Northeast, a drop of 4.8 percent, which left sales at an annual rate of 600,000 units. Sales were also off in the South.

Oh, Strike That: Talks Put Off Until Further Notice

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
With the temperature rising on the last day of the second week of the baseball strike, mediators recessed talks indefinitely yesterday, leaving the owners and players no less rigid in their positions than when they began face-to-face bargaining two days ago.
The heat came from each side in a give-and-take discussion of the owners' salary-cap proposal, according to participants in the second bargaining session, attended by 12 owners and club executives and a large group of players. 
 Not that the two sides were screaming at each other, but the four-member mediation team apparently felt that the talks were in danger of sliding backward, if that were possible, and they didn't want the situation to deteriorate.
"At this point it's our determination to recess these negotiations, subject to call," John Calhoun Wells, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, said after the two sides had met and caucused for three and half hours. "We will remain in close contact with both sides, exploring the most productive and useful format for resumption of these negotiations."
 
Strike Plods On
 And so, with 181 games and perhaps 375 home runs lost forever, the strike plods on. With 38 days and 488 games left in the scheduled season, nothing has happened that offers any hope for an agreement to rescue some of those days and games. The owners still want their salary cap, and the players still want no part of it.
The decision to recess the talks was made after a half-hour meeting the mediators had with each side's negotiating team. During that session, one of the participants, referring to some of the heated comments made earlier in the big meeting, remarked, "If we keep going, it's going to be like bullfrogs croaking on a pond."
Bullfrogs, it seems, are very competitive, striving to see which one can croak the longest, the deepest and the loudest. That, according to some of the participants, was how the meeting at the Hotel Inter-Continental was proceeding.
One of the more heated exchanges, they said, took place between Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox, one of baseball's most noted bullfrogs, and several union officials.
 
'We'll Do a Deal'
 Reinsdorf, people in the room related, kept saying the players should tell the owners what percentage of the owners' revenue they wanted and "we'll do a deal." After he asked again, "What percentage do you want?" Donald Fehr, the union chief, shot back, "How much profit do you want?" Reinsdorf did not croak an answer.
The owners have proposed to change baseball's economic system by placing a limit on club payrolls and have offered to give the players 50 percent of their revenue for their total compensation, including salaries, bonuses, daily meal money and pension and health care benefits.
The players have rejected the entire proposal, but the owners keep urging them to make a counterproposal, including any percentage they want. The players won't do that because they then would be accepting the concept of a salary cap.
One of the players' arguments against a cap is that it would inhibit free agency, preventing players from moving to teams whose caps are full or too close to full to offer the free agent a decent contract.
In a long opening statement at yesterday's meeting, David Glass, chairman of the Kansas City Royals and president and chief executive officer of Wal-Mart Stores, told the players baseball had to be more competitive to get entertainment dollars.
Glass also said, according to people at the table, "I don't understand how our plan can affect free agency."
Union officials figured he knew, but they explained it anyway. "There was a bit of an education process going on," Doyle Pryor, a union lawyer, said.
Educational sessions were conducted in smaller groups, too. During the lunch break, Wendy Selig-Prieb, vice president of the Milwaukee Brewers, responded to criticism the day before by Curt Schilling of the Philadelphia Phillies about the Brewers' general and administrative expenses. Those costs came under fire in the analysis of the clubs' financial data by Roger Noll, a Stanford University economist who was hired by the union to examine financial data provided by the owners.
Selig-Prieb, daughter of Bud Selig, the team's principal owner and the acting commissioner, explained to some players yesterday that the Brewers had picked up significant extra costs when they assumed operation of County Stadium and its expenses, thus swelling the general and administrative expenses.
Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator, said that during the last hour and a half of the meeting, owners and players had other side conversations. He seemed to think some of them might become productive. "I don't know what they all were," he said at a news conference. "I may hear about some of them."
 
Smaller Groups Expected
 Ravitch returned to his office to meet with his group of 12 club representatives. There was no indication whether any of them would return to the bargaining table, but Ravitch said that when talks resume he expects the groups to be smaller, the negotiating teams perhaps being joined by some owners and some players.
Fehr said he didn't know what the makeup of the management group would be in future sessions, but he said: "We're not going to exclude players and we're not going to have a press blackout. Other than that, whatever arrangement makes Dick feel better about it, that's what we'll do."
The mediators planned to talk with each side, engaging in a form of shuttle diplomacy to determine the right time for the next session. It is not expected before sometime next week.
Asked if the recess means talks have broken off, Fehr said, "We're not at the stage where somebody walked out in a huff and said, 'I don't want to talk to you again.' We're at the stage where there isn't anything to talk about."
Ravitch said he didn't think the lack of progress at these meetings was a foregone conclusion. "Nobody could know from day to day what's going to happen," he said.
Fehr, not surprisingly, did not agree with Ravitch's assessment
 
Cheering for the Cap
 "We suggested ahead of time these meetings would produce mostly a cheer session for Dick and the salary cap and that's mostly what they produced," Fehr said. "There has been no movement, no indication there's going to be any movement. The clubs are exactly where they planned to be. Their schedule has some time to run. How long we don't know."
In response to a question, Fehr said he believed one of the reasons the owners won't take their salary-cap proposal off the table is their intention to implement it unilaterally in the off season.
"If you change to another proposal," he said, "you have to make a unilateral imposition consistent with your last proposal. The adherence to the cap proposal, he added, is evidence that they do not want to reach agreement."
With the chances of salvaging any part of the season or the post-season dwindling with each unproductive day, John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox said management has thought of the possibility of playing the World Series later in a domed stadium but that it was impractical and "almost impossible" because of stadium commitments.
"It's unfair to the fans of those teams," he added. "We'd take that into consideration." But he added, "If it was absolutely necessary to have the World Series, it's possible we'd give it serious consideration."
The way Schilling, the Phillies' pitcher, sees it, no consideration will be necessary.
"I don't think we're playing baseball again this year," he said, a touch of sadness in his voice, "unless there's a complete reversal of fortune."

New to the Circle
"I've been aware I had to find a successor for some time," Theodore Mann said yesterday, telling why he recently named Josephine R. Abady co-artistic director of Circle in the Square.
Mr. Mann, himself the artistic director of the organization he helped found in 1951, is 70 years old, and for the last 18 months he has been desperately trying to keep the Circle, which hasn't put on a show since May 1993, from drowning in debt. 
 "I wanted someone who had been a director and someone who had run a theater," said Mr. Mann. "Someone who had faced the problems that an institutional theater faces, who could find sources of new funding. In other words, someone who has been in it up to the neck."
Ms. Abady, whom people call Josie, is in her 40's. She spent six years as the artistic director of the Cleveland Play House before her surprise dismissal in January by a board that was apparently dissatisfied with her nontraditional, occasionally risky programming. Before that she was the artistic director of the Berkshire Theater Festival for nine years. Both theaters were financially struggling when she went to them, and both were in better shape when she left. In a joint interview with Mr. Mann yesterday, she said she was about to sign a four-year contract, with an option to renew, that would elevate her to the position of sole artistic director in the fourth year, with Mr. Mann assuming the title of producing director and maintaining a voice in programming, but ceding the creative authority to Ms. Abady.
She enters a vexing situation. The theater, at 254 West 50th Street, has a debt of $1.3 million, the staff is down to five full-timers and there are 8,000 paid subscribers from a year ago who are owed a season. That season -- three plays chosen by Mr. Mann: a 20th-anniversary production of "The Shadow Box," by Michael Cristofer; "Uncle Vanya," starring Tom Courtenay, and a new American play Mr. Mann would not yet name -- will cost $4.1 million to put on, including debt service. Most of that is supposed to be covered by ticket sales, but of course money has to be raised to put a show on to begin selling tickets for it. The theater's estimate of what it will need to begin mounting the first show, now planned for November, is $250,000 to $300,000.
"It's very difficult to raise money for debt service," Ms. Abady said. "We're doing O.K. Could we be doing better? Yes. Are we going to raise what we need to get started? Yes."
Ms. Abady and Mr. Mann said their aim was to bring the theater into the 21st century with big, adventurous shows, giving as examples "The Kentucky Cycle" and "Abe Lincoln in Illinois." The emphasis will be on American plays, including a commitment to one new play a year, and they say they would like to establish a repertory company.
"Those are our dreams," said Ms. Abady, who will not direct a show this year so she can concentrate on setting the theater's financing and administration on a new road. "Now you want to talk about reality?"
 
'On the Waterfront'
 Over the Fourth of July weekend, Marcus Ticotin was talking to his former brother-in-law, and thence came the possibility that Budd Schulberg's dramatization of his own famous screenplay, "On the Waterfront," would come to Broadway.
Mr. Ticotin's sister, it turns out, is the actress Rachel Ticotin, who was once married to David Caruso, the one-foot-out-the-door star of television's "N.Y.P.D. Blue." And after a visit over the holiday weekend, it occurred to Mr. Ticotin, a producer of ballet and opera, that Mr. Caruso could be a contender for the role of Terry Malloy, the boxer-turned-dock worker who stands up to the mob, whom Marlon Brando made legend in Elia Kazan's 1954 film.
Mr. Ticotin then broached the idea to a friend, Mitchell Maxwell, a producer of films and Broadway shows (including the current revival of "Damn Yankees"). A result: Two weeks ago, the two men bought from Mr. Schulberg the rights to produce his play on Broadway between now and the spring of 1996.
Mr. Maxwell said this week that the play, which had its most significant previous production in 1988 at the Cleveland Play House (where it was directed by Josephine Abady, and where Terry Malloy was played by Grant Show, who is now, of course, a star of television's "Melrose Place"), lends itself to an extravagant production. It has a cast of 19, with action taking place simultaneously in more than one place onstage, and deserves to be produced "like a musical without the music." The money is in place for a production that could get on a Broadway stage as early as next spring, and if not, he said, then definitely in the fall.
Mr. Maxwell said the budget for the show was $1.5 million to $1.8 million, and it is already accounted for, guaranteed by his own company, Workin' Man Films. The show will go on, he said, with or without David Caruso, who is, Mr. Maxwell confirmed, the first choice for the role, and has been asked for a commitment of six months of performances. Mr. Maxwell added that obviously Mr. Caruso wouldn't be paid anything like the $50,000 a week he has been reported to have been offered.
Mr. Caruso, who hasn't been on stage in years (his manager, Chris Wright, said he didn't remember the last time), has just signed to star in "Jade," a movie thriller for $2 million. Conventional career-management wisdom would have it that he ought to do a few more movies to establish his drawing power and crank his price up before trying anything as risky as a Broadway play, where critics will be gunning for him and the money isn't anywhere near as good. So is Mr. Caruso actually considering this?
Yes, said Mr. Wright.
"The interest is sincere and the project is intriguing," he said. "The question is availability."
 
How Risky
 Two plays crossing in the night. "Suburbia," Eric Bogosian's raucous drama now finishing its run at Lincoln Center Theater, was a candidate for Broadway this fall at a Shubert theater, but the Shuberts decided against supporting the move.
"They decided it was overly risky, as opposed to risky," said Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater.
Meanwhile, Cynthia Ozick's "Blue Light," now at the Bay Street Theater Festival in Sag Harbor, L.I., could be on its way. The Shuberts have made an offer that has been termed, by one of the play's producers, David Brown, "economically feasible." And Bernard Jacobs, the Shubert president, acknowledges that they have been talking.
"But I don't know that anything has been decided," he said. As for "Suburbia," he added, "I never like to say why we didn't do anything."

GRAPHIC: Photo: "Old Friends and Bad Plans" -- Fred Ward is to play Vinnie, a double-dealing blackmailer in "Simpatico," Sam Shepard's new play about old friends, incriminating pictures and the Kentucky Derby. The play, which failed to land a commercial production last season, is to open at the Joseph Papp Public Theater on Nov. 1, with a cast that also includes Beverly D'Angelo, Marcia Gay Harden and Ed Harris.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Sculpture Under the Sky: Free, Daring and Soon Departed

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
A CENTURY ago, there were two kinds of outdoor sculpture in New York City: sculpture that commemorated and sculpture that decorated. American Presidents, Arctic explorers, even heroic huskies found themselves cast in bronze in Central Park. Nymphs and angels and animals of stone were de rigueur on fountains and facades across the city.
Things have changed with time. Heroism counts for less in our uncommemorative age and modernist architecture of glass and steel has little use for ornament. Yet, as even a glancing look at recent outdoor sculpture reveals, the form still flourishes. Detached from old uses, it is perhaps more marginal than of yore, but it is also more adventurous: as often abstract as figurative, politically critical rather than celebratory, confrontational rather than seductive, perfectly willing to trade permanence for ephemerality. 
 Adventurousness has liabilities. A few years ago, Richard Serra's "Tilted Arc" in Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan was judged user-hostile and carted away. And much experimental outdoor work by younger artists has a tough time landing a venue. None of the pieces seen on this summer's outdoor sculpture tour will be staying where they are and a common outdoor exhibition format is the group show in which several disparate works are corraled on a kind of sculptural wildlife preserve. But even under these conditions, the work has at least the potential for vivifying the city through a street-level participation unknown to gallery-bound art.
Roosevelt Island is as good a place as any to begin an outdoor sculpture tour, though the work on hand is of mixed quality. For the second summer, Manhattan's nonprofit Sculpture Center has organized a group show here and installed it in the lower level of the Motorgate (the island's transportation complex), just under the Roosevelt Island Bridge to Queens.
Site may not be everything to sculpture, but it can mean a lot, and this exceptionally dour space tends to dim the already feeble wattage of this year's show. Luisa Caldwell tries to perk it up by covering four of the structure's columns with bright wallpaper, converting them to sculpture by default. Her 19th-century French black floral patterns set against a red ground have a certain pizazz, but not nearly enough to warm their chilly surroundings.
Andrew Dunhill's steel assemblage of squat, interlocking stars and blocks is sensibly middle-of-the-road traditional. Satoru Takahashi's piece is more off-beat. He has created a bus stop shelter equipped with Plexiglas hemispheres that accommodate the viewer's head. From inside, they offer a distorted fish-eye view of the street. Moderately entertaining.
Only Itty Neuhaus's "Padded Landing" hints at the kind of sheer visual zaniness that outdoor work can shoot for. Ms. Neuhaus has encased an entire car frame in what looks like a colossal brioche and suspended it in a net from the Motorgate's high ceiling. Is it flying or being gently lowered to its parking space, cushioned against a fall? Whatever, it is a witty response to its garagelike setting and a reminder of the traffic streaming across the bridge overhead.
On the Queens side of that bridge is Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City, where close to 40 works, large and small, sit on a scrappy 4.5-acre waterfront lot facing Manhattan. There's a relaxed, informal feeling to Socrates, with works under way, under repair, in storage and just completed sitting in close proximity.
Some of the sculptures are by familiar artists in characteristic form. One of Chris MacDonald's overgrown wooden toys is here, as are three painted bronze figures by John Ahearn and a recent piece by the Socrates Park founder, Mark di Suvero. Mr. di Suvero was one of the pioneers of large-scale abstract outdoor sculpture 30-plus years ago, and his angled, stretching "Iroquois" exemplifies the enthrallment with space over mass that was modernism's redefinition of the genre.
Of particular interest, though, are several pieces by less well-known artists constituting this summer's show, "International 1993/ 94." The works vary in style and in quality, but there are some common links. References to nature, for example, abound. The four cast-iron fish in Jack Pospisil's "Salmon Cycle" refer to the river; Beth Galston's metal treehouse incorporating birch saplings recalls the forests that once grew along the shores, while Gunilla Bandolin's key-shaped, brick-lined amphitheater leads directly into a mound of earth.
Win Knowlton's remarkable "East River Landscape" -- a big rough disk of concrete with tires, bottles, duck decoys and other river detritus embedded in it -- is a cautionary vision of what nature in the immediate locale has become under the assault of industry, while John Hock has transformed immense machine parts -- including the barrel of a cement mixer -- into a funny, blundering bouquet to industry itself.
 
MetrotTech Center
 Ursula von Rydingsvard's three sculptures at two different locations within the sprawling Metrotech Center in Downtown Brooklyn are also monumental, but their spirit is gravely poetic.
Like most of Ms. von Rydingsvard's work, they are made of fragrant cedar beams laminated and then chiseled, sawn and gouged. One piece looks like a massive wall pocked with hacked-out indentations, another like the remains of an ancient ship. A third consists of 16 separate logs lying side by side on the ground. Carved with spiral patterns, they suggest outsized ritual instruments whose precise purpose is obscure. Expressionistic, romantic, redolent of myth, Ms. von Rydingsvard's works are like little oases of Teutonic reserve amid the bustling commercial activity at Metrotech.
 
Long Island University
 Much of the work at Long Island University, just across the street from the Metrotech Center, represents a complete departure from Ms. von Rydingsvard's hand-wrought, material-rich approach. The school's Fifth Annual Outdoor Sculpture Exhibition, organized by Marian Griffiths, includes several pieces of Conceptual sculpture that can barely be seen at all.
Even the most concrete piece has been carefully integrated into its surroundings. David Kramer's large, flat, black, steel "X" constitutes an apt political emblem for Downtown Brooklyn. At the same time, the elaborate girding welded to its back side amusingly mimics the structural support of a Dime Savings Bank billboard directly across the street, setting up an interesting web of socio-economic associations.
From that point on, the work in the show gets lighter and lighter, to charming effect. True, Michael Merchant's slim pavilion of upright poles is easy enough to spot. It holds 20 Instamatic cameras, which passers-by are invited to use for picture-taking (borrowing is on the honor system and Mr. Merchant processes the film free). But Lee Boroson's baby-blue inflated rubber bladders, clinging like helium balloons to a courtyard wall, and Lisa Hein's red banner, whose only emblem is a smile-shaped cut that lets the breeze pass through, are all but invisible to even the most attentive eye.
Judith Simonian has come up with the most discreet work of all: two trash cans at opposite sides of the university's main plaza linked by invisible speaking tubes for quick information exchanges or a casual tryst. Ms. Simonian's low-tech, radically anti-monumental mode could easily become precious, but it represents one of contemporary art's distinctive formal contributions: it is a sculpture of the inconspicuous and the physically inconsequential, requiring viewers' patience but rewarding it with an intimacy seldom associated with public work.
 
Snug Harbor
 Site-specific work in a similar vein can be found at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center on Staten Island, a former refuge for retired sailors whose grand Greek Revival buildings and shade-dappled grounds make it one of the city's most delightful parks.
Of the works in this year's annual outdoor sculpture show, called "Thresholds and Transitions," Kate Dodd's "now you see it, now you don't" "Meander" takes full advantage of its setting. The piece exists almost entirely as traces of Day-Glo orange paint marking a route through the Snug Harbor grounds in Livingston. The first stroke appears on a bench set under the portico of Main Hall; others show up here and there on pavement or as colored paper pulp pressed into the bark of trees. The path ends with a ramshackle wooden perch over a wooded glade, by which point Ms. Dodd's peripatetic, performative work has offered the diligent viewer total submersion in Snug Harbor's serene terrain. (Unfortunately, the Parks Department has fears that some of Ms. Dodd's materials may be environmentally unsound and her piece is scheduled for removal in the near future.)
Of the other pieces in this year's show, Jim Hirschfield's "Synesthetic Dream" is technically an indoor installation assembled in a turretlike gatehouse on the grounds. Bringing together digital clocks, orchids, painted glass vases, pinned butterflies and atmospheric lighting, he creates an environment in which physical dimensions are ambiguous and time is palpably on the move. The effect borders on sci-fi hokum, but hokum skillfully done.
The best work is Leone and Macdonald's "Outhouse," a steel door, its central panel missing, set on hinges within a frame. A bronze knob on one side is marked with the word "Us," on the other side with "Them," and the door swings both ways, giving insiders and outsiders, whatever those terms may mean, equal access. And thanks to its thoughtful siting, the piece has much to say about outdoor sculpture itself, old and new. Looking through the door from one direction, one sees a view of the waterway called the Kill van Kull; looking through from the other, the 19th-century obelisk-shaped tomb of Snug Harbor's founder, Robert Richard Randall. Nature and culture are conflated, and the moral preoccupations of our own time are linked to the memorial concerns of another.
 
Battery Park City
 Tyrone Mitchell's "Chair in the Sky: For Charles Mingus," on the south end of the Esplanade at Battery Park City, is poignant evidence, in fact, that the commemorative spirit in outdoor sculpture lives on. Mr. Mitchell has constructed a small chair from scraps of found wood cast in bronze, and set it high on a pole against the sky within sight of another impressive outdoor work, the Statue of Liberty. The chair is based on the form of an African king's throne and in place of a likeness of the great jazz musician, Mr. Mitchell has placed a low pyramid on the seat, as if to channel energy -- the music of the spheres, perhaps -- down to this spot.
 
Central Park
 Judith Shea's new work, "The Other Monument," at Doris C. Freedman Plaza -- commissioned, like Mr. Mitchell's, by the Public Art Fund -- is also commemorative, symbolically rich and politically nuanced. Its spare, dark-stained wooden figure on horseback stands atop a 10-foot-tall boxy platform at the southeast entrance to Central Park, just behind Augustus Saint-Gaudens's gilded equestrian monument to Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman.
While Saint-Gaudens's sculpture honors a Civil War leader, Ms. Shea's speaks in memory of American slaves, to whom comparable monuments were never erected and many of whose graves have been obliterated. Whether the Union that Sherman fought for can ever be realized as long as racial disharmony exists is one of the many questions Ms. Shea's figure raises. And historically speaking, there is some logic in the fact that while Sherman will continue his triumphant sculptural ride on Fifth Avenue in perpetuity, "The Other Munument" will have left its spot by this time next year.
 
Riverbank State Park
 Another of the summer's figurative works also has a message to convey. Robert Ressler's "No Heat," in the striking, still-new park along the Hudson in West Harlem called Riverbank State Park, consists of two huge carved wooden legs set in a striding position. The feet are shod in thick sandals and the trousers on one leg are rolled up to mid-calf, explaining the work's title: in street parlance, this sartorial touch is a visual code indicating that the wearer is not carrying a gun strapped to the ankle.
If "No Heat," which is still being worked on at Riverbank, is neither the grandest nor the subtlest of the outdoor sculptures on view in the city, it gives a fair sense of the genre's distinctive potential. It exploits the kind of eye-catching scale that plein air siting permits, and it shrewdly addresses itself to the concerns of the community in which it appears. Mr. Ressler's piece, like public work throughout the centuries, will be a recurrent, even daily experience for its viewers, subliminally shaping their lives and sharpening their vision in ways that physically less available art cannot. It is heartening to see contemporary public sculpture, with all its strengths and weaknesses, embrace this responsibility.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
Starring John Candy and Various Crude Jokes

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
What if the citizens of Prosperity, a frontier town in the Old West, got fed up with their pioneer existence and decided to head back East? And what if they chose for the leader of their wagon train a drunken tub of a man who can barely tell left from right? That is the less-than-scintillating premise of "Wagons East!," a dimwitted comedy that like the addled wagonmaster John Harlow (John Candy), who tries to lead them home, takes all the wrong turns.
"Wagons East!" has the distinction of being Candy's final film, and it is dedicated to his memory. That, unfortunately, is its only distinction. Directed by Peter Markle, from a screenplay by Matthew Carlson, this series of loosely strung-together gags is so desperate for humor that it falls back on jokes about flatulence and penis size. Candy, who was a gifted comic actor, has little to do but lumber around and act endearingly dumb. 
 Most of the passengers on the wagon train are contemporary urban types who find themselves way out of their element. Richard Lewis is a neurotic surgeon who has developed a phobia about wielding a scalpel, and who during the trek insists on conducting group-therapy sessions. And when he finally does pick up a scalpel, watch out!
Another traveler is a homosexual bookseller who has given up trying to peddle Jane Austen to the rough-and-ready frontiersmen at whom he is always making eyes. As played by John C. McGinley, he is a walking dictionary of stereotypically effeminate gay mannerisms. Ellen Greene plays Belle, a whore with a heart of gold, with the same Betty Boop voice she brought to "Little Shop of Horrors."
On their eastward trek, the travelers accidentally stray into Sioux Indian territory and are menaced first by a professional gunslinger and then by the United States Cavalry. Both the gunslinger, whom Ed Lauter plays as a Clint Eastwood caricature, and the cavalry are mobilized by a greedy railroad baron who sees the party's retreat as signaling a trend-setting economic threat.
Typical of the movie's humor is the moment when a bellicose young Indian protests to his father that he despises his name, which subtitles reveal means Little Feather. On the spot he is rechristened with a name that means Big Snake That Makes Women Faint. "Wagons East!" is the kind of movie that stops in its tracks every time it tries to tell a joke, and it is invariably one that is not worth repeating.
"Wagons East!" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has off-color humor and mild violence.

WAGONS EAST!
 
Directed by Peter Markle; written by Matthew Carlson; director of photography, Frank Tidy; edited by Scott Conrad; music by Michael Small; production designer, Vince J. Cresciman; produced by Gary Goodman, Barry Rosen, Robert Newmyer and Jeffrey Silver; released by Tri-Star Pictures. Running time: 100 minutes. This film is rated PG-13.

WITH: John Candy (James Harlow), Melinda Culea (Constance Taylor), Ellen Greene (Belle), Ed Lauter (John Slade), Richard Lewis (Phil Taylor) and John C. McGinley (Julian)

HEADLINE: Cuba: Time to Talk

 BODY:
Well, why not open broad negotiations with the Castro regime?
The Clinton Administration was quick to rebuff Fidel Castro's proposal of multi-issue talks yesterday. Washington anticipated a propaganda session where Havana would offer to keep its unhappy citizens from leaving only if the U.S. promised to ease its economic embargo, halt anti-Castro radio broadcasts and maybe throw in the return of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base to Cuba as well. 
 The Administration says immigration is the only issue it will talk about. Washington should respond more creatively, insisting that any discussion of issues between the two countries must also include democracy and human rights.
Fidel Castro has had his dictatorial way with Cuba for the past 35 years, brooking no dissent, turning neighbors into spies and driving many of his own people to risk their lives to get away. He blames the U.S. for troubles of his own making and would sooner see Cuba's economy collapse than make concessions to foreign demands.
If that kind of behavior disqualified a regime from negotiations, Washington would never have been able to reach out to Mao's China or Kim Il Sung's North Korea. Neither could it have talked with Syria about Mideast peace terms, Bosnian Serbs about cease-fires or Haiti's generals about the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
In diplomacy, it is often more important for governments to talk to their enemies than to their friends. That is how Israel reached agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization. But for most of the past three and a half decades, Washington has never seriously considered talking to Havana.
It ought to consider such talks now. The Castro regime's present weakness makes this an especially promising moment to negotiate, if Washington plays its hand effectively.
Once a genuine menace as a Soviet outpost, Cuba has power to influence American politics that has outlasted the cold war. Hundreds of thousands of Cuban emigres are now U.S. voters and their most vocal leaders have made any dialogue with Cuba a domestic political taboo. The Administration is understandably reluctant to challenge that taboo. It does not need any new political problems. Yet its attempt to improvise unilateral responses to the refugee challenge is already damaging its own credibility and jeopardizing broader American interests.
For what good cause is the Administration preventing Cuban-Americans from helping their families stretch meager budgets with dollar payments? Has it not yet learned the importance of setting, and holding to, its foreign policy priorities?
The Cuban-American hard-liners from whom the Administration is taking its cues want to escalate internal tensions in Cuba rapidly in order to force an explosion, and perhaps a U.S. intervention, that would bring the Castro regime down in flames. The Administration itself is not prepared to go that far, nor is it clear that such an Armageddon scenario would serve Cuban democracy or America's best interests. Many Cuban-Americans also shy away from a confrontation that could turn their own relatives into sacrificial victims.
By agreeing to wide-ranging talks with Cuba now, and insisting on the broadest possible agenda, the U.S. may find it has some bargaining power to help Cubans struggling for democratic change. The alternative is to punish Cubans and embarrass the United States. That would not hurt Mr. Castro nearly so much as it would damage Mr. Clinton.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Why Two Cops Were Shot in the Subway

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Two cops are wounded by police bullets in frenzied crossfire on a New York subway platform. The people and the press demand to know why such a thing happened, and who was responsible.
Why? Two young thugs strolled into the subway, one with a handgun and the other with a shotgun. That is why. The rest is the consequence of cops risking their lives to do their duty. 
 One plainclothes officer, gun drawn, chased the two men. He was shot by mistake by an off-duty policeman also wearing civilian clothes, who was then shot by a transit officer.
Who was responsible? The two men who carried their guns into the subway, criminals in the act.
Cause and responsibility seem to me obvious. But living in this city you would certainly never guess it. The press, lawyers, public, even the police all concentrate not on the thugs and how armed hoods can strut about streets and subways, but on how come cops do not react unfailingly to the sight of a man aiming his gun by bowing, checking the wristband color of the day and exchanging badge numbers and calling cards.
One day science may tell us how to hire only cops with infallible control over their adrenaline, heart rate and brain signals. Meantime, I want to see, read or hear a lot more about the guns and how the criminals got them, who owned them before and how many death merchants are peddling guns on what streets. That's the how come I want to know.
I want to know about every crime the men committed before taking guns into the subway. And please, easy on the bit about how their neighbors say what good boys they were.
Mayor Giuliani and Police Commissioner William J. Bratton have stood by the officers while ordering the necessary inquiries. But I am sorry they missed a chance to tear the head off New Yorkers.
They should have said that our city, like the whole United States, is fouled by guns, stinks of them. Say it plain: Until we do something about that deathly stench the men and women we hire to protect us will be doing their duty knowing that every minute of every tour they are surrounded by muggers, killers and thieves in greater number, expertise and firepower than the world has ever experienced.
I favor total registration and licensing of guns and government control of all gun sales outlets. I know very many Americans will fight every move. The rest of us can fight back with every political, intellectual and economic tool we have, win when we can and return to fight again.
But is that really all, no way for us to fight guns ourselves?
If I were mayor, I would lead the essential attitude-change campaign, from a button in my lapel to organizing parades, demonstrations, neighborhood watches, rewards; and do that for the rest of my term.
If I were a rich man, I would put big philanthropy money into anti-gun causes; maybe then my chauffeur could park outside my favorite restaurant without getting a gun stuck in his ear.
A teacher: I would fill my walls with anti-gun truths, and my children's heads. A clergyman: I would not have to be told.
If I were a politician I would fight for tougher anti-gun laws, and if I were a judge I would enforce them. If I were a member of a civil liberties group I would insist that it re-examine its positions against allowing search for guns, or blocking public housing tenants from having their buildings swept.
As a journalist, I can ask print editors and TV news producers to put more violence into the news, a different kind, the violence of truth.
I would tell cameramen on the spot to get tight close-ups of the wounds if at all possible. I would ask the police -- or courts if necessary -- for pre-autopsy pictures from the morgue, and print them.
The pictures would sicken children and grown-ups, which would be the purpose. It would be one antidote of truth against the lies we constantly see in movies, TV reruns and videos: gun-shot people with no viscera hanging out of their bodies, no feces dripping from their clothes.
None of these ideas will end America's gun disgrace. Only a few generations of voters will do that. But it is a lot more useful to do something against guns yourself, any decent thing, than just hang around clucking at cops for having found themselves on a subway platform when two men strutted in, smug with firepower.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON'S ALLIES ON HEALTH CONCEDE THAT BROAD PLAN IS ALL BUT DEAD THIS YEAR

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Democratic Congressional leaders and White House officials today all but conceded any chance of passing universal health insurance legislation this year. But they vowed to press on for what they can get, and suggested they would take anything that did more good than harm.
As the Senate decamped for a two-week break, and the House extended its own vacation to match, the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, and the White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, both took sober stock of the remaining prospects for health insurance legislation and laid some groundwork for what might yet be won. 
 In one sense, Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Panetta were simply stating the obvious. But their comments also reflected the reality that the Senate's adjournment without acting on health was an irretrievable step and that the President will have to choose between settling for something far less than the universal health coverage he has insisted on and nothing at all.
Mr. Mitchell said that anything that might be passed "clearly will not be a bill as comprehensive as I would prefer, but there's much that can be done that would represent progress."
For his part, Mr. Panetta maintained public optimism, saying he still hoped that a break from the Capitol's rancor and glare would let a bipartisan group of Senate moderates forge a compromise that would meet Mr. Clinton's fundamental goals. But he said that Mr. Clinton could accept a plan that called for only incremental changes -- like insurance law changes to prevent companies from denying coverage to sick people -- as long as Congress did not portray it as fulfilling the task of health care restructuring.
"That is something the President would look at," Mr. Panetta said, though he steadfastly refused to say what options Mr. Clinton might accept, saying it was too soon to say what Congress might present. "But it isn't health care reform and nobody should be misled that it's health care reform."
Mr. Clinton himself spoke to reporters in careful terms. "I certainly don't want to embrace an approach that will do more harm than good and that won't achieve our objectives," he said. "But let's see what they're doing, and see what people are feeling like after they get a night's sleep or two." At another point, he said passage of the crime bill showed it was possible to pass complex, sweeping legislation, "So I'm not prepared to make a final judgment on that at this time."
The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, campaigning in Oklahoma for Representative James M. Inhofe, the Republican Senate nominee there, issued a statement warning that there was so little time left on the legislative calendar that "unless we sacrifice Congressional action on everything else," there was no way the Senate could pass a health care bill that went beyond the basic insurance provisions in Mr. Dole's own bill.
No words could disguise the change that had come over the Capitol.
Corridors that had rung just 24 hours earlier with fierce oratory and dueling news conferences were silent this morning, as Senators hurried home to campaign or vacation, and skeletal staffs stayed behind to work.
The White House's best hope for some action still seemed to rest with a bipartisan group of moderates led by Senator John H. Chafee, the Rhode Island Republican who was one of seven members of his party to break ranks and help the Democrats pass the $30 billion crime bill on Thursday. The group is working on a scaled-back proposal for insurance law changes and deficit reduction.
"We think there's still time to come up with good legislation," Mr. Chafee said as he left Mr. Mitchell's office at midday with Senator John B. Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat and co-leader of the group. But he added, "That doesn't mean it's easy."
Mr. Mitchell said this afternoon that the meeting had gone very well and that "there are many ways where there is a common objective and we'll be able to think of ways to reach a common objective and find ways to reach agreement."
 
More Ideas Take Shape
 Mr. Chafee and Mr. Breaux said their staffs would put their proposals into legislative language and continue working with Mr. Mitchell's aides to delineate points of agreement and remaining differences. But they said they had still not determined whether their proposals would take the form of a completely new bill, amendments to Mr. Mitchell's, or some third, even more whittled-down plan.
As it is, the moderate group's plan relies on new subsidies to increase health insurance coverage to 92 percent of Americans over the next decade, up from 85 percent now, and cuts in growth in Medicare and Medicaid to reduce the Federal deficit by about $100 billion over the same period. Mr. Mitchell's proposal aims to increase coverage to 95 percent and could require employers to cover half their workers' insurance costs if the goal is not met.
The moderates are not the only ones still at work. Democratic Senators on the liberal edge of the party, like Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Tom Harkin of Iowa, have begun looking for their own minimalist plan, one that might increase coverage for children and the elderly without a new bureaucracy or large tax increases.
But the barriers to any bill are formidable. Just before the final vote on the crime bill, Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who is one of Mr. Dole's potential rivals for the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination, took the floor to say that the good news today was that all such plans were dead.
 
Ardent Opponent of Change
 "The Clinton plan is dead, Clinton-Mitchell 1 is dead, Clinton-Mitchell 2 is dead, Clinton-Mitchell 3 is dead and Clinton-Chafee is dead," said Mr. Gramm, who has vowed to fight the Democrats hammer and tongs on the topic.
Mr. Mitchell, asked about that, just smiled. "He said that about the crime bill and he said that about the President's economic plan last year," the leader said. "On two for two, he's been wrong, and I hope that it will be three for three."
Prospects for action in the House, where leaders are waiting for official cost estimates of various pending bills, are just as uncertain. And now, with the Senate away until Sept. 12, House leaders today revised their schedule to return the same day, instead of right after Labor Day. The majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, was at home in St. Louis and made no statement, his office said.
Just as the White House officials have repeatedly refused to be drawn into defining universal coverage, Mr. Panetta, at a luncheon meeting with reporters, declined to say just what incremental steps the President might accept. The Administration has consistently contended, for example, that requiring insurers to accept all customers, even those with health problems, without guarantees of universal coverage could encourage healthy people to wait until they were sick to buy insurance. That would leave insurers with sicker and sicker risk pools, and driving up premiums for everyone else.
 
No Use in Speculating
 "To start speculating now -- it doesn't make any more sense to do that now than it did six months ago," Mr. Panetta said. "What the President is not prepared to do is sign a bill that comes to him under the guise of health care reform but does not meet the needs that he laid out."
Saying that Mr. Clinton had not changed his bottom line, Mr. Panetta said anything portrayed as health care reform had "to be in the Mitchell mode: you can transition it in, but at the end of the transition, you have to arrive at universal coverage."
Mr. Chafee predicted that as businesses realized inaction by Congress this fall could lead to a patchwork of conflicting new insurance requirements imposed by state legislatures, they would support uniform nationwide changes. Otherwise, he said, "they're going to be nibbled to death."
Mr. Breaux added, "I think everybody loses if we don't do anything." But dressed in an open-necked tropical shirt and on his way to a 2:40 P.M. flight to New Orleans, he also hollered good-naturedly at reporters: "Go home! It's vacation time."
Mr. Chafee, too, was headed home, where he faces a re-election race. But, perhaps mindful of the adage that it's easier to tear down a barn than to build one, he had another stop first: the National Building Museum in downtown Washington, to see an exhibit on barn-building.
"I'm a barn nut," he said as he rushed off for a quick chat with Mr. Dole's staff.

CONGRESS
 After passing the crime bill on Thursday night, the Senate left yesterday for a two-week break, putting off work on the health measure. The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, said that anything that might be passed "clearly will not be a bill as comprehensive as I would prefer, but there's much that can be done that would represent progress."
 
WHITE HOUSE
 Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said he still hoped that the bipartisan group of moderates in the Senate would be able to forge a compromise that would meet President Clinton's fundamental goal of universal coverage. But he said that Mr. Clinton could accept a plan that called for only incremental changes, like insurance law amendments to prevent companies from denying coverage, as long as Congress did not portray such a plan as fulfilling the task of health care restructuring. Mr. Clinton said: "I certainly don't want to embrace an approach that will do more harm than good and that won't achieve our objectives.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE POLICY;
Refugees Ebb but Tide of Criticism Is Rising

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Thanks to stormy weather, the Clinton Administration got some relief today in the Cuban refugee crisis, but it met heavy Congressional criticism for tightening sanctions and refusing to hold broad talks with President Fidel Castro.
As a result of storms and high waves, the number of Cubans setting out to sea dropped precipitously. The Coast Guard picked up 629 Cubans in the Straits of Florida today as of 10 P.M., a far lower rate than during the previous seven days, when a total of 11,810 Cubans were rescued. 
 President Clinton told reporters that he was encouraged about the decrease in refugees, saying the weather "may or may not have something to do with that." "We just need to be calm, steady and firm," he said. "I think we will work through it just fine."
Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who met with Administration officials criticized the President's harsher policy toward Cuba, warning that it would backfire and increase the flow of refugees.
 
Senators Criticize Policy
 The criticism intensified as the Administration announced details carrying out the President's order of Aug. 20 to slash the flow of dollars and American travelers going to Cuba. The new regulations are intended to cut off the flow of more than $150 million that Administration officials say is entering Cuba each year.
"The Cuban Government will no longer have access to these U.S. dollars which have so long helped to sustain the Castro regime," said R. Richard Newcomb, the Treasury Department official overseeing enforcement of the new sanctions.
Under the new regulations released today by the Treasury, Cuban-Americans, who could previously travel freely to visit family members in Cuba, will only be allowed to go for emergencies like terminal illness.
The new regulations also bar Americans or foreigners in the United States from sending money to Cuba unless they can demonstrate that it is for an emergency, like helping an elderly cousin buy medicine. Previously, Americans were allowed to send up to $300 every three months.
Although the new measures will squeeze many poor Cubans, Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, insisted that the sanctions are aimed at hurting Mr. Castro and not the Cuban people.
After meeting late Thursday with Administration officials to discuss Cuba, several senior members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee attacked the new policy.
"The President's policy goes in the wrong direction," Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who is the committee's chairman, said in an interview. "We should ease the embargo because then Cubans will have less incentive to leave and come to Florida. By increasing the embargo, it's increasing the number of people who want to escape the Castro regime."
Senator Pell also criticized President Clinton for rejecting Mr. Castro's call to hold wide-ranging, high-level talks to defuse the crisis. "The more contact between adversaries, the better off we are," he said.
Senator Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican, described Thursday's meeting as an "unmerciful pile-on" in which the six senators present harangued Alexander Watson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, and Morton H. Halperin, a senior National Security Council official. The Senators at the meeting included Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, and Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin.
Senator Lugar said: "The President should not categorically rule out the possibility and usefulness of talks with our adversary at this point. We have found it useful to talk to North Korea, Syria and the Chinese. A great power with substantial diplomatic and military authority ought never be in a situation where it can't discuss what's on its mind."
Senator Dodd said: "They're trapping themselves by adopting a position of no discussions or negotiations. That's a dangerous position to put themselves in."
A task force of former government officials and academics also criticized the Administration's refusal to hold broad talks with Havana. The task force, organized by Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington research center, is headed by former Attorney General Elliot Richardson. It includes Argentina's former President, Raul Alfonsin; McGeorge Bundy, national security adviser to President Kennedy, and John C. Whitehead, deputy secretary of state under President Reagan.
"We urge the two governments to turn away from confrontation and begin to negotiate the issues that divide them," the group said. They also urged the President to reverse his decision to restrict charter flights and curtail remittances to Cuba.
The new sanctions limit the gift parcels to medicine, food and other relief items, effective today.
Under the new regulations, except for the purpose of financing lawful immigration, cash remittances will be permitted only on a case-by-case basis through specific licensing.
Previously, professional researchers could travel freely to Cuba, but under the new rules, researchers will need licenses. The new rules also permit travel by human rights investigators and people on educational or religious missions.
The regulations continue to allow Government officials, journalists and foreign diplomats to travel freely to Cuba. But they revoke previous rules on travel financed by foreign governments or by Cuba.
Administration officials estimated that 50,000 people traveled from the United States to Cuba last year, pumping an estimated $100 million into Cuba's economy. One official said that the new restrictions would cut travel to Cuba by 80 to 90 percent.
Some members of Congress insist the Administration's new sanctions are not tough enough. "We should have a naval blockade around Cuba," said Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida. "The Administration should use its diplomatic capital to persuade its allies to support such a blockade."
Rather than restricting travel to Cuba, Senator Lugar called on the Administration to increase the flow of tourists, students, satellite dishes and radios to Cuba. That, he said, would increase the flow of Western ideas and help undermine Mr. Castro.

CUBA EASES STAND ON TALKS
 LA PAZ, Bolivia, Aug. 26 (Reuters) -- Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina of Cuba said today that his Government "wouldn't refuse" if the United States wanted to discuss immigration without bringing in other issues.
"Cuba wouldn't refuse if, in the strictly immigration area, there is some interest in having conversations," he said in Bolivia, where he was on an official visit. "We would be ready to listen."
Cuban officials had said earlier this week that their Government would not discuss the current exodus of refugees from Cuba with the United States without discussing a broad range of other outstanding issues.

HEADLINE: President Foresees Safer U.S.

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
In exulting over the passage of the $30 billion crime bill, President Clinton predicted wondrous results.
"This crime bill is going to make every neighborhood in America safer," he said, looking forward to the prospect that police officers will no longer be outgunned by criminals, who will also be deterred from crime by the possibility of life in prison as a result of the "three strikes and you're out" provision. 
 But even some of the most ardent supporters of the legislation acknowledge that the crime package, which was the subject of weeks of heated debate, will probably accomplish far less. If there is any lessening of crime, it would only come gradually, they say. Others say the main achievement of the legislation will be to make the public feel that the Government is trying to respond to a growing concern.
The bill cleared its last legislative hurdle Thursday night after the Democrats won over enough Republican votes to overcome a procedural challenge. The legislation, which the President plans to sign when he returns from his vacation next month, bans the sale and possession of 19 models of semiautomatic weapons and other weapons that are nearly identical to those models. It also provides grants to local governments to hire more police officers, variously estimated at 20,000 to 100,000 nationwide; increases from two to 60 the number of Federal offenses for which someone may be sentenced to death, and provides for life sentences for criminals convicted of a third violent felony or drug offenses if the third conviction is a Federal crime.
 
Symbolic Value of Legislation
 Some scholars, removed from the partisan bickering, say it is uncertain whether the measure will appreciably reduce crime. Yet a leading authority said that even if it did not reduce crime, it would have a genuine symbolic benefit for a nation increasingly troubled by crime and the perception that it is growing out of control.
"To talk about its efficacy is to miss the point," said Frank Zimring, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley. "It is far more important as a symbolic denunciation and expression of concern than as a serious crime counter-measure."
Professor Zimring singled out one part of the legislation that has drawn the most analysis and greatest skepticism: the assertion that the measure provides for the hiring of 100,000 new police officers around the nation.
"It is simply not 100,000 extra police and everybody knows that," he said.
The measure is supposed to increase the number of police in the nation, not immediately but over six years. Yet it provides only about $9 billion, which analysts have said means that local governments would have to supplement the funds they receive with their own revenues.
Moreover, the money from the Federal pie gets smaller each year, leaving the local government with an increasing burden until it has to assume the entire salary of the officer.
 
Reluctance Is Foreseen
 "A lot of cities are going to be reluctant to take this money for this purpose," said Jonathan Rubinstein, a former police officer who has written extensively about policing. Mr. Rubinstein said a local government had to figure that hiring a police officer was a 50-year financial commitment, 20 years on the force and 30 years of pension. "When the money runs out, you can't just lay these people off," he said.
There are more than 20,000 police jurisdictions in the United States and with that in mind, 20,000 to 100,000 new officers does not look like such a large addition, he said.
Which is why, in the debate, Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, described the crime bill as a down payment on an aggressive commitment to reduce crime.
Gerald Caplan, the dean at the McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, Calif., said the crime bill was at the least a demonstration that the Government was trying to respond to public concern about crime.
Dean Caplan, who served as director of the National Institute of Justice, a Federal research agency, from 1973 to 1977, said he had long been a skeptic about whether the Federal Government could effectively reduce crime, which has historically been a local concern. "But the revenues available at the local level have not kept pace with both crime and the public frustration about it," he said.
That frustration, he said, is a result of a new breed of criminals on the street who are often as young as 14 and have guns and little social conscience. "These are not good candidates for rehabilitation," he said.
The "three strikes and you're out" provision may have serious flaws, he said, but it will eventually keep some of these criminals behind bars so they cannot commit more crimes.

No Telling When Sides Will Open Talks Again

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
A deafening silence descended on baseball yesterday as the players strike entered its third week. Following two days of earnest but unproductive and sometimes heated conversation between club officials and players, the visitors to the bargaining table returned home and the principal negotiators retreated to their offices.
John Calhoun Wells, the director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, spoke briefly with members of each side but did not suggest a date for the resumption of talks. Wells recessed negotiations Thursday before the owners and players could become too angry with each other and damage future efforts. 
 Just when that future will be is not known. Asked when he might call the two sides back to the table, Wells said from Washington: "That decision won't be made until next week. That'll be driven by our sense of timing based on conversations with the players and the owners."
 
Midweek at the Earliest
 It's most likely the negotiating teams will meet next week but probably not before Wednesday, which is the last day before the start of what usually is the last month of the season. The strike has already wiped out 195 games of the season.
Asked yesterday if he thought the season would resume, Donald Fehr, the head of the players' union, said: "The likelihood goes down with each day you don't have an agreement. I can't tell you at this point if the owners want to resume it."
Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator, said the owners indeed want to get back to playing, but he added: "There will be no baseball until there is a collective bargaining agreement. There will be no collective bargaining agreement until this issue is resolved."
The issue, stated in various ways by management, is a salary cap, cost control, cost certainty, sharing of the owners' revenue.

 
'A Simple Proposition'
 "We are talking about a simple proposition that was stated clearly and unequivocally at the meeting yesterday," Ravitch said. "How do we divide revenues between us? That has to be addressed and resolved and everything else will fall into place."
Whatever terminology is used, the players view the owners' attempt to change the economic system as an effort to lower their salaries artificially and to impede the movement of free agents.
"What is clear in this negotiation," Fehr said after the second owners-players session, "is the owners' goal is exactly the same as it's been in every negotiation dating back to at least 1976: 'We will impose a series of impediments to free agency. We're going to set up roadblocks.' Sooner or later, this industry has to get past the point where it says someone can't take a job where he wants on whatever terms he can get. The owners won't let him do that. The owners want to limit job opportunities. I don't know how to get anywhere from that position."
 
Not an Inch of Progress
 The two sides have moved nowhere. Chances are, when they return to the table, their positions will be the same. If each side is testing the other, to see if the other will blink or fold, both sides are passing the tests with flying colors.
Ravitch said that after having had private conversations with players during the two days of talks, some owners reported that the players were convinced the owners are not serious about their pursuit of a salary cap and ultimately will change their position. Yet, Ravitch said, the players seemed to be impressed with the sincerity of the views the owners expressed.
When Fehr was asked yesterday if he thought the owners were coming to the conclusion the players will not cave in, he said: "Some of them already know that. Those are the ones that want to carry it past the end of the year."
Was he suggesting that those owners -- the ones who presumably want to reach the point where they can implement the cap unilaterally -- were banking on the players' resolve to carry on their strike through the end of the season?
"I don't know if they're banking on it, but they expected it or they've come to realize it," he said.
Fehr said he wasn't certain who "they" are. "I don't know if there is a 'they' anymore," he said. "What if we're really in the worst situation: They can't get 21 votes for any proposition the players will accept."
He referred to the owners' rule that requires a three-fourths vote of the 28 owners to approve an agreement that would end the strike.
Fehr said he wasn't sure how anyone would proceed from this stagnant point.
"Who knows?" he said. "There are no rules at this stage. There are no expectations."

Rich Bowls, Big Deals, But Better?

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN 

 BODY:
WE are now supposed to comprehend the difference between a coalition and an alliance. A century and a quarter has passed since the day students from Princeton and Rutgers gathered to begin the process that would one day connect the phrase "smash-mouth" to the mission of American higher education. It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Decades before professional leagues expanded west and south, their game created connections between fragmented rural populations and faraway cities. College football overcame its early brutality to define a sense of time and place. The game provided something that most major league franchises could not and never will, the comfort of lasting personal traditions, passed on in the form of living, breathing heirlooms shared by a region, a state or a nation. The Dodgers could up and move a continent away. The Philadelphia Athletics could leave for Kansas City. But Penn State wasn't going anywhere. 
 But it has, without the need for a single moving van. This is not the fault of anyone near Mount Nittany, whose administrators are far from alone. Emotionally, the Lions moved west when they agreed to join the Big Ten four years ago. Texas and Texas A&M, among others, will soon move north, as they help create the Big 12, leave the Southwest Conference in a lingering death and reduce the importance of the Cotton Bowl forever.
That is the way of the college football industry in the 90's. Every now and then the music starts, and everyone walks apprehensively in a big circle, and when the music suddenly stops you had better be in a seat. Little else matters anymore. Fear has given us the new semantics game, the distinction between a coalition and an alliance. A coalition is this year's convoluted arrangement of bowl games; an alliance is next year's equally convoluted deal. Please don't ask about the deal after that.
With each new arrangement, each new bowl game mating dance and conference reconfiguration, the college football establishment is stepping closer to the danger of forfeiting its most valuable possession -- its soul.
As experts unconcerned with the impact on the lives of players continue to scream for a megadollar playoff scheme, football's traditions have become as much of a problem as a blessing. Basketball has been free to move, to experiment, to meet the demands of the market, because with the exception of a handful of hotbeds, college basketball tradition can now be defined by who played on ESPN last night.
But football traditions were evolving even as James Naismith was tinkering with his peach baskets and his rules. From the time Yale fans took this Princeton concept and turned it into an excuse for a tailgate party, the experience became more personal. Which is why the followers of the game, having held their traditions so close, are having a hard time letting go.
Penn State, to its credit, realized the psychic damage of a made-over schedule and set out to do something about it by resuming its emotional series with Pittsburgh three years from now. But the limitations of Big Ten scheduling will force those games to be played in early to mid-September, far from the feel of season-ending games in the cold and snow, a sensation about as natural as eating pumpkin pie at a Labor Day picnic.
When the game reaches the point when too many deals destroy the feel, when the haves achieve their goal of squeezing out the have-nots, we may one day wake up to find a junior varsity National Football League, devoid of the charm that has held the attention of generations.
Florida and Florida State will have no shortage of emotion when they meet on Thanksgiving weekend. But the Gators already understand that they will somehow have to ration their energy because any hope for a national championship would next hinge on the outcome of the Southeastern Conference championship game the next Saturday at Atlanta. The same thing has happened to Alabama-Auburn. And the soon-to-come annual fund-raiser known as the Big 12 championship game could have the same effect on Texas-Texas A&M and Nebraska-Oklahoma.
This is not a vote against progress, or a plea to return to the days of back-stabbing, double-dealing, smoke-filled bowl deals. But as Nebraska and West Virginia begin a new season tomorrow, the decision-makers should consider the possibility that the Rose Bowl is not a barrier. It is an economically healthy reminder of what the sport should be, a game with enormous emotional value beyond polls or rankings or alleged "significance," a warm winter day that has managed to retain its importance because it is so much like the ones that were passed on to us.

Markets
Investors returned to the stock market in a big way this week, bidding up stocks for the largest one-week gain in 19 months. Investors are encouraged by stabilizing bond prices, a rising dollar and, above all, a more optimistic picture of a sound, low-inflation economy. The Dow gained 51.16 points yesterday. [Page 35.] 
 Treasury prices rose sharply after the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, in a revision that was less than what the bond market had expected. A stronger dollar also aided government securities. [43.]
The dollar surged against the German mark and other currencies in a rally prompted by the G.D.P. report. Many traders say the dollar has finally rebounded from a seven-month slump. [46.]
Coffee prices climbed to more than $2 a pound. Traders worry that a drought in Brazil, the biggest coffee producer, will further damage its crop at a time when seasonal demand rises. [46.]
 
Companies
 Bidding for the Madison Square Garden sports and entertainment empire appears to be nearing a climax. A team of ITT and Cablevision, competing against Liberty Media, is said to have the higher bid -- $1.05 billion -- on the table. [35.]
Customers can download their food and their Internet mail in the cafe of the Dallas Infomart, a convention and sales center known as a high-technology showcase. At the newly opened High Tech Cafe, the goal is to wine, dine and be on line. [35.]
General Motors and the U.A.W. are waging a war of inches as the company seeks to cut costs and the union tries to save jobs. A move to a just-in-time delivery system makes the auto maker more vulnerable to strikes like the one this week at a parts plant in Anderson, Ind. With so much power over production residing at the local level, the union and the company are essentially bargaining year-round, hammering out piece by piece the shape of the new, more efficient General Motors. News Analysis. [35.]
Toyota Motor announced that it would raise prices in the United States an average of 3.5 percent. Japanese auto makers have been forced to raise prices more often and more sharply because of the rising value of the yen against the dollar. [37.]
Shares of both Comdisco and I.B.M. rose after the companies said they had settled a three-year-old lawsuit. I.B.M. had accused Comdisco of taking other manufacturers' memory chips and marketing them as genuine I.B.M. parts. [37.]
 The Fox network gained control of the ABC affiliate in New Orleans and NBC affiliates in Honolulu and Mobile, Ala. [37.]
 
The Economy
Gorwth in gross domestic product was revised to 3.8 percent for the second quarter, up slightly from an annual rate of 3.7 percent. The report, showing a higher level of unsold goods and less Federal spending, signaled to many economists that growth would slacken to a range of 2 to 3 percent in the current quarter. [35.]
 Competitive pressures for more high technology in the workplace appear to produce wider differences between the rich and the poor, the Federal Reserve chairman said. [43.]
 
Your Money
 Beware of hidden charges when buying bonds. Investors should inquire about the costs of buying bonds and be wary of brokers who balk at such questions or give evasive answers. [33.]
Barton M. Biggs sees stocks poised for recovery, and that should hearten investors because he is looking particularly prescient at the moment. Mr. Biggs, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asset Management, predicted late last year that short-term interest rates would rise and roil securities markets worldwide. [33.]
A hybrid of a home loan and a fixed insurance annuity is being promoted as a way for consumers to diversify and build a nest egg. But the mortgage, called the Asset Integrated Mortgage, may not be the best way for most people to save. [33.]
Auto insurers are looking at the credit histories of applicants, as well as their driving records. Allstate will now ask for credit ratings when underwriting new auto policies in 39 states. [34.]

HEADLINE: Technology Seen as Widening Income Gap

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 26

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said today that competitive pressures for the introduction of more high technology into the workplace appeared to produce wider differences between the rich and the poor in industrial societies.
Speaking at the Federal Reserve's annual conference here today, Mr. Greenspan said that "where such market forces are allowed to play out more evidently, such as in the United States, the unemployment rate is lower and measured income inequality higher." 
 The trade-off between income inequality and technology was described today by Paul Krugman, a Stanford University economist. Mr. Greenspan told the audience here that "the argument for this trade-off is a persuasive one."
If the free market is allowed to operate, then new technologies will continue to be introduced that allow skilled workers to replace unskilled workers, Mr. Krugman said.
As governments seek to balance this effect through expanded unemployment benefits, there will be less incentive for unemployed people to accept jobs that may pay less than their former jobs, so unemployment will tend to rise, he said.
 
A Main Worry
 Evidence that the gap between rich and poor is widening has become a pet concern of Mr. Greenspan, who is fond of pointing out that more and more of the economy's output consists of ideas made into products, like computer software, rather than bulky goods like cars and refrigerators that still require brawn.
Mr. Greenspan also repeated his previous criticisms of the theory that unemployment can be reduced by allowing inflation to rise. "Any tendency to seek a bit of macro policy relief by pushing on the outer limits of monetary policy risks longer-term financial instability," he said.
The theory that sustained reductions in unemployment can be achieved through higher inflation was popular during the 1960's and early 1970's, but it was widely discredited among academic economists when both inflation and unemployment rose in the late 1970's. Most economists now favor keeping inflation low at all times because large increases in inflation have tended to produce very modest gains in employment, while large increases in unemployment have then been needed to bring inflation down slightly.
Roughly half the members of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy committee are attending the conference, as are top central bank officials from Germany, Japan, South Korea, Canada, Spain, Chile, Mexico and New Zealand.

HEADLINE: After a Lull, Stocks Come Roaring Back

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Tentatively at first, but then with increasing assurance, investors returned to the stock market this week. And with a 51-point surge in the Dow Jones industrial average yesterday, they bid up stock prices for the largest one-week gain in 19 months.
Until this week, the stock market had been stagnant at best. Individual investors, as well as institutions commanding billions of dollars in assets, had pulled back from the market and put much of their holdings into cash. 
 But encouraged by stabilizing bond prices, a rising dollar and, above all, a more optimistic picture of a sound, low-inflation United States economy, they have begun to buy stocks again.
It will take a few more weeks of rising stock prices to confirm that this week's rally is the rekindling of the powerful surge in the stock market that was halted abruptly on Feb. 4, when the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates to fight inflation. But some analysts say this is the real thing.
Barton M. Biggs, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asset Management, said he had been expecting a market rally for more than a month, and this may be it. "Slow growth and low inflation around the world are bullish for long-term financial assets, particularly stocks," he said.
Yesterday, the Dow rose 51.16 points, to 3,881.05, a rise of 1.34 percent. For the week, the increase totaled 125.65 points, or 3.3 percent.
The previous one-week record this year, according to the New York Stock Exchange, was nearly 107 points, or 2.9 percent, for the week that ended on May 20. During the week that ended on Feb. 5, 1993, the Dow rose 132 points.
The broader indexes, with more stocks than the Dow's 30 blue-chip companies, were also up for the week. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was up 2.2 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index of more than 4,500 stocks was up 2.8 percent.
"Some people here doubt that this rally is the real thing, but I don't," said Jerry W. Mill, who helps to manage nearly $3 billion of stocks for Invesco Funds Group in Denver and has been optimistic about the market throughout the summer.
Some funds in the company once had 5 cents of every dollar invested allocated to cash, but earlier this summer increased the cash allocation to 20 cents on the dollar, he said. "A lot of people with high cash levels are putting them to work" and buying stocks, Mr. Mill said.
Matthew Avery, senior portfolio manager for the Franklin Group of Funds in San Mateo, Calif., said he planned to keep his cash levels at about 13 cents of every dollar, but could change his mind. He also manages about $3 billion of stocks. "Having a solid week like this opens everyone's minds to the positive factors moving the market," he said.
True, many analysts say the rally will be short-lived because it is fueled by a variety of temporary factors, chiefly professional traders who lost their bets that the market was going to fall.
As the last of these traders buy or sell shares to stem their losses, the market will plateau and the rally will stall, these analysts say.
The biggest factor in yesterday's rise was yet more evidence of a sound economy growing with little inflation. Government economists reported a revised growth rate of 3.8 percent in the output of the nation's goods and services, a slower-than-expected rate for the period from March to June.
 
A Boon to Investors
 A reversal in market sentiment would mean an unlocking of much of the money now parked in short-term cash instruments. It would also mean a boon to investors who have increasingly tucked away billions of dollars in stock-related investments.
Investors already seem to be anticipating some sort of rise. Stock mutual funds alone swelled by more than $2.2 billion in the week that ended last Wednesday, according to AMG Data Services.
Unlike institutional investors, individuals have continued to pour money into stocks, despite the market's poor showing this year; still, last week's increase was the largest since mid-June, according to AMG's weekly data. Such stock funds now have assets of $754 billion.
The market's move this week is significant. The seven-month halt in the stock market's advance has frustrated millions of investors who have seen their individual stock portfolios, stakes in mutual funds, or pension fund investments in stocks grow little, if at all.
But now, $1,000 invested for the year to date in the 30 stocks represented in the Dow index makes a profit of $33.80. While still small, it is better than the small loss or no gain before this week.
In the 160 business days to Friday, Aug. 19, the Dow moved scarcely at all, up just 1.31 points, to 3,755.40. But because of this week's advance, the Dow has risen nearly 127 points this year, or 3.38 percent.
 
A Notable Number
 The volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above average, with 305.6 million shares changing hands, or about 7 percent higher than this year's average of 286 million shares. The number is even more notable for being 15 percent higher than the more restrained summer volume of 265 million shares.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.64 points, to 260.82, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,508 to 699. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.44 points, to 449.56.

HEADLINE: Quarter's Economic Growth Revised to 3.8%, Up Slightly

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
More signs of a slowing economy emerged today as the Commerce Department, revising its initial estimates of growth in the second quarter, reported a higher level of unsold goods and markedly less Federal spending..
The gross domestic product was revised upward slightly, to an annual rate of 3.8 percent from 3.7 percent, far less than most analysts had expected.
"Growth was not as ebullient" as the 4 percent or more that was widely anticipated, said Carol A. Stone, senior economist at Nomura Securities in New York. "So the chances for an early further tightening by the Federal Reserve are reduced." 
 The report immediately ignited strong rallies in the bond and stock markets, which in their joint aversion to higher interest rates have customarily moved together in recent years. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond fell to 7.48 percent from 7.53 percent. [Page 43.]
 Today's report seemed to confirm for many economists a belief that economic growth will slacken to a range of 2 percent to 3 percent for the current quarter with any pickup during the autumn being modest. Many economists contend that 2.5 percent is the fastest pace the economy can sustain without a rise in inflation.
"This is clearly suggestive of a growth downshift," said Stephen S. Roach, a top economist at Morgan Stanley, pointing particularly to today's data indicating that the buildup in inventories was more concentrated than previously thought in domestically produced items.
Data on inventories are among the most difficult economic figures to interpret since it is almost never clear whether a rise, say, reflects a sudden absence of customers or a burst of confidence by retailers or manufacturers. Moreover, inventory figures tend to be statistically confusing since the broadest gauge of economic performance -- the gross domestic product -- rises when goods and services are produced without regard to whether anybody buys them.
So, while a jump in inventories contributed substantially to second-quarter growth -- accounting for 63 percent of it -- analysts assume that the buildup in goods will lead to some subsequent cuts in production and that in any event such a contribution to G.D.P. is unlikely to be repeated.
"Speculation that the inventory overhang going into the third quarter would be less threatening was dashed quickly" by today's revision, Donald E. Maude of the Scotia McLeod brokerage firm said.
 
'Onto a Slower Path'

 
 Spending on personal consumption, about two-thirds of all economic activity, was revised only slightly higher, today's report showed, to a pace of 1.4 percent from 1.2 percent.
"Growth clearly is moving onto a slower path," said Robert G. Dederick, a former Commerce Department official who is executive vice president of the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
He predicts a 2.6 percent pace for the current period, about a percentage point less than the average for the first two quarters of 1994, when growth was 3.3 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively. In late July, the department estimated that second-quarter growth in G.D.P. -- the total value of goods and services produced -- was at a seasonally adjusted constant-dollar pace of 3.7 percent.
Even with lackluster spending lately, today's data showed that the personal savings rate had edged down to 3.9 percent from the 4 percent initial estimated in late July.
 
No Jump in Prices

 
 Inflation gauges associated with G.D.P. data showed little change in today's report, with the fixed-weight price index for gross domestic purchases edging up to a 3.3 percent pace from 3.2. In current dollars, G.D.P. growth was at a 6.9 percent pace during the spring instead of the 6.8 percent first estimated a month ago.
The biggest upward adjustment in the G.D.P. data was an extra $2.3 billion for business inventories, with final sales of domestic product now showing a 1.4 percent gain instead of 1.5 percent.
The sharpest downward revision was a $3.6 billion drop in the figure for purchases by the Federal Government, but Ms. Stone also noted a decline for brokerage services.
The Government's first assessment of corporate profits for the quarter, also a part of today's report, showed sharp improvement. Profits from current production surged 7.7 percent after falling 4.8 percent in the first quarter.

Coffee Jumps on Concerns About Brazil's Dry Weather

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Coffee prices jumped above $2 a pound yesterday as traders became increasingly concerned that dry weather in Brazil would further damage its coffee crop at a time when seasonal demand rises.
In other commodity markets, oil prices slid while copper surged. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 0.09 point, to 230.88. 
 At the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee for December delivery soared 13.35 cents, to $2.1115, breaking the $2 level for the first time in three weeks.
"We are heading toward the peak demand period at a time when consumer stocks have been falling and the outlook is for contracting supply and ongoing weather uncertainty for Brazil," said Sandra Kaul, an analyst at Smith Barney Inc.
 
A Frost and a Lack of Rain
 With the Brazilian trees about to flower, the lack of rain during the last two months could curtail next year's crop.
"There is increasing concern that the coffee trees in Brazil need rain now, not a month from now," another trader said.
Brazil's coffee plantations, which produce roughly one-quarter of the world's supply, were already hit by frosts in late June and early July that damaged about 40 percent of the trees.
"This is only the start of a big rally," said Judith Ganes of Merrill Lynch & Company. The highs seen in coffee prices this summer, she said, "should be eclipsed in the fall and winter months when coffee consumption peaks."
Ms. Ganes said demand for coffee would outpace supply this year, but price increases trickling down to the retail level would eventually cause a decline in coffee drinking.
"If we look back in history, there is usually a one-year gap between a big price increase and a drop in consumption," she said. "Consumption now is stable, at least in the U.S."
 
Oil Prices Down
 Crude oil prices closed sharply lower in largely technical trading. The October contract for crude oil fell 38 cents, to $17.14 a barrel.
Copper prices rose to their highest levels in nearly five weeks, helped by rallies in stocks and bonds. September copper was up 2.55 cents at $1.118 a pound.
Mike Frawley of Dean Witter said the fundamentals for copper prices continued to be positive and "physical demand remains strong."
Copper prices were also bolstered by the Commerce Department's report on the gross domestic product. The report, which showed signs of a slowing economy, suggested that no further increases in interest rates were down the road, which would hurt copper demand, said Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential Securities Inc.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Brokers' Hidden Charges On Bonds

BYLINE: By Susan Antilla 

 BODY:
HAVE rising interest rates piqued your interest in the bond market? Not a bad idea for some portfolios, perhaps. But don't jump in until you have a handle on the elusive costs of buying bonds.
A broker from New York's W. J. Nolan & Company made the mistake of cold calling to pitch Ginnie Mae bonds to a reporter recently, and hidden charges were the last thing he wanted to discuss. 
 "Mrs. Antilla, I'm working on a strategy for investing in Ginnie Maes -- I don't know if you are familiar with Ginnie Maes," he began, adding that they were paying a guaranteed rate of return of 7.5 percent to 8 percent a year. Ginnie Maes are pools of mortgages backed by the Government National Mortgage Association, which provides a Government guarantee against default and eliminates credit risk. Still, the securities' value fluctuates with interest rates.
What, the reporter asked, were the commissions on such an investment?
"Commissions?" he replied. "O.K. Let's say you buy a $50,000 bond. There is no commission or fee or sales charge or anything like that."
Not the whole truth, the reporter thought. Bond brokers make their bucks on the price "spread" between what the brokerage house pays for a bond and the marked-up price paid by the buyer. This spread varies, depending on the firm, the customer and the size of the purchase.
"No costs at all?" came the disingenuous question.
 "What I earn, and what my company, W. J. Nolan, earns, is built into the price," he replied. "We might buy $50 million of bonds at the wholesale price, if you will."
W. J. Nolan might go to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, he continued, and pay 99 cents on the dollar for a bond and then sell it to the customer at 100 cents on the dollar. So the brokerage firm's profit is "already in it," he said.
(Never mind that Ginnie Maes are not traded there.)
"So what if I bought a $50,000 bond from you this morning," the reporter said. "With no commissions, I guess what you're saying is that I could sell it right back to you for $50,000?"
Well, not quite right, came the answer. The bond would be subject to "market risk" if the investor were to sell it six months later, he said.
"But I'm asking you what would happen if I sold it immediately," the reporter countered.
"It would depend on how rates were moving a couple hours later," said the broker, who identified himself as Terry Fortunate.
"What if I sold it two minutes later?" the reporter asked, exasperated that the broker would not acknowledge that the bond would immediately be worth less as a result of the broker's markup. "Or what if another customer were selling the same bonds at the very same moment?"
More runaround ensued.
"It would depend on the price we'd be getting for the bonds," Mr. Fortunate said when pressed to respond. Besides, buying bonds "is not like calling up a firm like Quick & Reilly and paying a stock commission," he said, not "when you're a principal owner, as we are."
"But I thought you said that you went to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange to buy and sell bonds for your customers," the reporter said, wondering why the broker was now suggesting that the firm was selling bonds from its inventory as a principal owner. If the bonds were already in-house, there would be no uncertainty from waiting to get an exchange price.
When the reporter called back later in the week to say the broker would be included in an article about bond commissions, Mr. Fortunate said he would refer the matter to a senior member of the firm. In a subsequent call, William Nolan said that his broker was not "cold calling," or making a sales pitch to someone who had expressed no interest, because the reporter had made a query to Nolan while working on a previous article nearly two years ago. It was a "recycled lead," Mr. Nolan said.
Fair enough. But what of the matter of markups?
Jay Goldinger, a bond broker at Capital Insight in Beverly Hills, Calif., said that investors should specifically ask a bond broker about his sales credit on a prospective purchase. And "if he says he doesn't know, he's lying," Mr. Goldinger said.
Expect a generous sales credit of 1 to 2 percent of the purchase price, or "anything they think they can get away with" in the case of a naive investor, Mr. Goldinger said.
 And if the broker balks repeatedly at the question, consider buying those bonds elsewhere.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges After Report Shows Economy Is Slowing

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar surged against the German mark and other leading currencies yesterday after a report showed the American economy was slowing.
For many traders, the rally confirmed a belief that the dollar was finally rebounding from a seven-month slump that took it to a post-World War II low against the yen and a 20-month low against the mark. 
 "The dollar is clearly bottoming," said Marc Chandler, director of research at Ezra Zask Associates, a Norfolk, Conn., hedge fund with $180 million under management.
The dollar rallied yesterday after the Commerce Department revised the gross domestic product for the second quarter up slightly, to an annual rate of 3.8 percent from 3.7 percent, far less than most analysts had expected.
The smaller-than-expected revision suggested that the United States economy was not growing fast enough to increase the inflation rate; higher inflation would erode the value of interest-bearing investments like Government bonds. Prices of United States Treasury securites rose sharply yesterday.
Currency analysts and traders often watch the performance of the Treasury market for clues about demand among overseas investors for American assets. Those investors must buy dollars to purchase American stocks and bonds.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5773 German marks from 1.5423 marks on Thursday. The move of 3.5 pfennigs was the dollar's largest one-day gain against the mark since Jan. 9, 1992.
The dollar rose to 100.67 yen from 99.65 yen, rising above 100 yen for the first time in more than a week.
The speed with which the dollar rallied caught many traders off guard, analysts said. The currency jumped in part because many traders who had sold dollars for marks and yen earlier, hoping to buy them back at a lower level later, had to purchase dollars today to limit their losses.
"The dollar was like a freight train today," said David De Rosa, director of foreign-exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation. "There was no stopping it. I imagine there were a lot of people who were unpleasantly surprised."
In other currency trading in New York, the dollar settled at 5.4002 French francs, up from 5.2860 francs on Thursday; at 1.3335 Swiss francs, up from 1.3025 francs, and at 1,598.50 Italian lire, up from 1,563.50 lire. The British pound tumbled to $1.5278.

HEADLINE: Barton Biggs Is Burying the Bear

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
For a living, Barton M. Biggs predicts market booms and busts around the globe. Sometimes he even causes them.
Mr. Biggs, the chairman of Morgan Stanley Asset Management, is one of the most venerable seers on Wall Street. If he says, as he has in recent years, "Put money in emerging markets," plenty of institutional investors do so -- and a boom is born. 
 Mr. Biggs is looking particularly prescient right now. Late last year, he predicted that short-term interest rates would rise and cause trouble for securities markets around the world. Sure, that seems obvious today, but at the time, stocks were soaring in the United States, and many market gurus were forecasting the best of all possible years in 1994.
All of which explains why investors may be heartened to hear that Mr. Biggs is a good deal more optimistic now than he was then. In an interview last week, he said that he expected stock markets to rally -- perhaps very soon.
"It would be typical of the orneriness of the market for there to be a strong upsurge around the world next week, because all the great money managers will be at the watering holes of the upper class, and they don't want the week before Labor Day disturbed," he said wryly.
Such quips are typical of Mr. Biggs, whose bulletins and travelogues are widely read and quoted, even by those who disagree with him.
But he has substantive reasons for saying stocks are ready for a rally. Many markets got pounded in the first half of the year, and many investors have suffered enormous losses in derivatives, bonds and some emerging markets. "This was not just a minor summer squall; it was a serious bear market," Mr. Biggs said, "and it would not be surprising to get a good recovery from that." In addition, many professional investors remain gloomy, which in the topsy-turvy world of Wall Street is considered a positive sign.
Similarly, the malaise on the political front may not be all bad. Although Americans may be dismayed by the gridlock in Washington, Congressional inaction is probably good for the stock market, Mr. Biggs concludes. "I think it's pretty clear we are not going to get a health care plan, and whether you like it or you don't, it is really a tax increase, and the market does not like tax increases," he said. "The market is beginning to think the Republicans will have a significant victory in the '96 elections, and that Clinton is fading badly, and the market thinks those things are bullish."
The economics are favorable, too. "Basically, slow growth and low inflation around the world are bullish for long-term financial assets, particularly stocks," he said.
Which markets does he favor? He likes American stocks, particularly small-capitalization companies in the emerging growth category. (He would avoid cyclical stocks, however, and says "bonds are boring.")
But his favorites are the smaller Asian stock markets, which he says "will be the best place in the world to be for the next five years." In particular, he recommends Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong, citing dramatic growth prospects and relatively cheap prices. All three markets have fallen significantly this year.
Not everyone shares his enthusiasm for investing in what used to be known as less-developed countries and are now called emerging nations. Small positions in emerging markets may be suitable for large institutions, but "for individuals to have more than a toehold is fraught with risk," said Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates in Greenwich, Conn., who recently published a book on global investing. "I don't think we really understand these markets very well." he added.
Mr. Biggs does not play down the risks of emerging markets. These investments, he said, are "only for the brave; you've just got to accept the fact that they will be volatile."
A market losing his favor is Tokyo, which he recently cut to a 20 percent portfolio weighting, from 30 percent. He still wants to have significant exposure there, but is losing confidence that corporate earnings will take off.
Mr. Biggs has been swayed by some Morgan Stanley colleagues, who point out that although Japanese companies have been through a depression and deflation and have restructured and cut costs, they have not cut employment. Corporate earnings, consequently, may increase by only 25 percent a year, instead of the 70 percent that Mr. Biggs once expected. Big American companies would love to have that kind of earnings growth, but then, big American companies' stocks trade for roughly 20 times their earnings. Japanese stocks trade for more than 80 times earnings.
He is also cautious about Brazil, where stocks have soared more than 75 percent this year. Positive political and economic developments have already been factored in, he said. "I'm worried that if there's any kind of bad news in Brazil, you could have a very, very sharp drop in both the currency and the markets."
Because of such risks, big institutions cannot bet too heavily on small stock markets. Right now, Mr. Biggs is suggesting that they put 22 percent of their portfolios in emerging markets. But individuals, he suggests, should consider putting as much as half their holdings there.
"I don't mean widows and orphans," Mr. Biggs said, "but for the aggressive individual who can afford to take some risk, the conventional heart of danger is the safest place."

HEADLINE: HUD Plays Too Rough

 BODY:
Last year a neighborhood group in Berkeley, Calif., protested the conversion of a local motel into a shelter and treatment facility for recovering drug addicts and the mentally disabled. Before they knew what had hit them, members of the group were under investigation by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, accompanied by demands for their mailing lists and all their writings about the project.
There were threats of fines and jail terms. Last week HUD finally dropped the investigation, after finding no violations. 
 HUD conducted its investigation under the 1968 Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988. The Fair Housing Act protects housing rights of the disabled, including the mentally ill, drug addicts, alcoholics and those suffering from AIDS. It is a worthy law that tackles the nation's most persistent form of racial isolation -- housing segregation.
Nevertheless, HUD's muscular defense of the groups protected by the law, particularly its strong-arm tactics, interfered with a community's right to raise legitimate questions about how, why and where the Government chooses to place its social-services facilities. Not all Americans object to social services simply because they want them in somebody else's backyard. HUD has been operating without clear distinctions between legitimate protest and discrimination, and it needs to make them.
Under the Fair Housing Act it is unlawful to "coerce, intimidate, threaten or interfere" with any person's exercise of fair housing rights. It is also potentially unlawful to harass people on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status or national origin.
As Roberta Achtenberg, Assistant Secretary of HUD for fair housing and equal opportunity, explained this week in The Washington Post, "the First Amendment does not protect a landlord or neighbor who employs intimidation or verbal abuse to discourage someone from moving into housing because of his race, religion or disability."
Placement of facilities that house and serve society's most troubled citizens is the subject of emotional debate almost everywhere. More affluent neighborhoods may simply want to keep out populations that demand a lot of social services; but some neighborhoods, particularly those that are politically and economically weak, may legitimately fear an overconcentration of social-services facilities and an influx of troubled populations.
Under present rules, neighborhood groups that raise these questions or stage formal protests have to answer to HUD, which is conducting 32 such investigations across the nation. No group should be allowed to use intimidation or harassment to keep out needed facilities, but onerous Federal investigations of neighborhood groups that are exercising their rights of protest and free speech can also constitute intimidation and harassment.
HUD should therefore set clear standards of conduct before an investigation of any private group is triggered -- excluding from retaliation, for example, legitimate forms of citizen protest like circulating petitions. It should also apply uniform rules to all investigations, with the broadest consideration for free-speech rights.
The debate over where to place public facilities for the troubled and disabled needs to be as open and wide as possible. HUD should not use strong-arm tactics to stifle it.

HEADLINE: After a Lull, Stocks Come Roaring Back

 BODY:
Tentatively, but then with increasing assurance, investors are returning to the stock market. With a 51-point surge in the Dow Jones industrial average yesterday, they bid up stocks for the largest one-week gain in 19 months.
Until this week, the stock market had been stagnant at best. But now, stock investors have become encouraged by stabilizing bond prices, a rising dollar and, above all, a more optimistic picture of a sound, low-inflation United States economy. 
 It will take a few more weeks to confirm whether this week's rally marks a rekindling of the powerful surge that was halted abruptly on Feb. 4, when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. But some analysts say this is the real thing.

HEADLINE: A Neighborhood In Waves

BYLINE: By Verlyn Klinkenborg; Verlyn Klinkenborg is the author of "The Last Fine Time," a social history of a Buffalo bar.

 BODY:
HISTORIANS OF CITIES ARE OFTEN FOOLED BY the endurance of buildings. The camera loves buildings because they conform to the camera's idea of standing still, of not flinching, of acting natural. When you look through the photographic archives of a city like Buffalo -- a galvanic giant not so long ago -- what you frequently see is a crowd of humans smeared in motion across the foreground, while in the background the buildings stand tall, resolute, confiding. It's easy to imagine a neighborhood -- the Lower West Side of Buffalo, for instance -- as though it were mainly a stockpile of buildings, an architectural shoreline of sorts. Into it flows a "wave" of people, marked by ethnic background or economic class. The wave leaves a high-water mark on the neighborhood and then it recedes, making room for another wave. The only thing that remains in focus is the buildings. What is human is averaged out in the motion of the wave.
You get at one kind of truth with that kind of history -- like driving through Buffalo on the New York State Thruway, hoping to make Cleveland by nightfall. But in a living neighborhood there is never only one kind of truth. 
 In 1939, when he was 30, Milton Rogovin opened his optometry practice on Chippewa Street in Buffalo, near the edge of the Lower West Side. That was a time when Buffalo's neighborhoods still seemed to have the temporary ethnic coherence historians and politicians love. The East Side was largely Polish; the Lower West Side was largely Italian. But if you approached the neighborhoods not ward by ward but house by house, you would have found something completely different, an almost unmappable complexity of people and purposes. As in most cities, then and now, what made the neighborhoods in Buffalo was not where you came from but where you hoped to end up.
"I came mostly for the trade union people," Rogovin told me not long ago. "I was a product of the Great Depression and what I saw and experienced myself made me politically active." When I asked him if he thought of his photography as explicitly political, Rogovin said, "I like to photograph people with problems." He purchased a used camera in 1942 but did not become serious about photography until 1958, when he began taking photographs in storefront churches on the East Side of Buffalo. A collection of those photographs was published in Aperture in 1962, with an introduction by W. E. B. Du Bois.
By the time Rogovin began taking photographs on the Lower West Side in the early 1970's, the neighborhood had become one of the poorest and most ethnically diverse in Buffalo. To the west lay the waterfront, an old industrial center, and to the east lay the antiquated mansions of Delaware Avenue. Italian homeowners had begun to sell out in the early 1960's, and hundreds of houses had been pulled down in the name of urban renewal, leaving behind a place of which Rogovin said, "There was a tremendous amount of potential on the Lower West Side, and it was just rotting away."
Rogovin was invited into the Lower West Side neighborhood by his patients, who introduced him to their families. Before long, he had become a familiar figure on the street. "For the first six months," Rogovin has said, "there was real uncertainty. They thought I was the F.B.I. or the welfare department. But I would take a picture and then give a print to the person. Soon people were saying, 'Have the old man take your picture and he'll give you a photograph of yourself.' I let them select the place. I never told them what to do. Because of the nature of the area, I seldom asked them their names."
Some of the photographs Rogovin took on the Lower West Side in 1973 and 1974 were published in a collection of his work called "The Forgotten Ones" (1985), which included photographs taken in Mexico, Chile and Appalachia. In the early 1980's, Rogovin's wife, Anne, urged him to go back to the Lower West Side, as she did again in the early 90's. They tracked down Rogovin's former subjects by going to a street corner with a box of photographs. "People would gather round and I'd show them the pictures. They would tell me who had OD'd, or was in jail; who had moved away, or had split up; and where I could find the others who continued to live there." What Rogovin has captured is a still-life record that seems to move nonetheless, a history of the human form as it evolves over three decades.
In these moving photographic sequences, it is not the buildings of Buffalo that endure, but the people. This is an utterly different kind of urban history. The neighborhood is not an architectural shoreline, and nothing human has been averaged out. Here is the full weight of time and trouble, and something almost indomitable besides.

The first picture was at my baptism. My grandmother was 80 at the time; she turned 100 this year. She lived in Sicily most of her life, then moved to Toronto 30 years ago to be with my uncles and aunts. She's still there now, but she lives in a nursing home. Sometimes she tries to trick you. She'll call my dad up and say, "I'm dying, I'm dying." She does it to get you to go visit, but she's really fine. My dad goes at least once a month. He's my grandmother's favorite because he gives her anything she wants.

Genoveva Torres, 57
The photographer asked the whereabouts of my children, so I took out the picture to show them to him. It was made by an artist in Puerto Rico. It is a custom in Latin culture to have the paintings made from photographs of the children while they are young so you always have the memories. My children are all scattered now. I do miss having them around here. It is important to have memories of when they were young to compare to where they are now. All of my children have a copy of the picture, and they have all had the same kind of picture done for their own children. All of my children have copies of these three photographs, too.

Nunzio Varco, 72
I got married in Italy in 1954. I came to the United States in 1960. I have lived in the same house since 1965. A relative of mine says we come to the United States. I was poor, working for my uncle -- my father died when I was a little kid. I was happy here, so I stay here. I have never gone back. My wife and I, we always stay together. We don't believe in divorce where I come from. Matrimony is matrimony forever. There is no secret. I don't like change. It's too late, I'm too old now.

Jimmy Webster, 23
My father is the flip side of what I'm doing. I was pretty young when he went to jail. The last time I saw him was when he was dying of a brain tumor. There was nothing they could do for him and he died in prison. A guy took me under his wing and started training me as a carpenter. I've worked as a carpenter for the past eight years. We used to live in the fruit belt -- that's on the Lower East Side. My mom got us out of that ghetto. She was the one that raised us. Pretty proud of her. She's a lady foreman in construction -- the first one in her union. Life's shaky, but we keep banging away at it.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Foxwoods' Expansion Plans Trouble the Region

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
THESE are unsettled times in southeastern Connecticut. Electric Boat and related arms industries in Groton and New London eliminated more than 8,000 jobs. And the Mashantucket Pequots are buying up land for expansion with profits from their Foxwoods gambling casino, while patrons and 9,000 employees clog local roads 24 hours a day.
The next six months promise to be even more unsettled if the Federal Government approves plans for a second gambling casino by the Mohegan tribe in Montville across the Thames River from Foxwoods and lets the Mashantuckets annex a large parcel of land. 
 Foxwoods has eased the unemployment problem by hiring hundreds of laid-off armament-industry workers. And it has given the region's moribund real estate market new heart by buying hundreds of acres and dozens of houses through local brokers.
But the Mashantucket tribe's appetite for property, and their ability to hold it free of taxation and local use controls -- worries residents of Ledyard, where the casino is situated, and North Stonington and Preston, where the tribe has bought land. Since the casino opened in 1992 the tribe has accumulated almost 4,000 acres in the three towns and contracted to buy more, said William R. Haase, Ledyard's Town Planner.
Of that total, almost 1,200 acres of the original reservation, where the casino and two hotels are situated, are in a Federal trust -- commonly called annexed -- under the terms of the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Land Claims Act enacted in 1983. Trust lands are exempt from taxes and the jurisdiction of zoning, environmental and other municipal bodies. The remaining tribe-owned acreage is subject to taxes and local oversight.
"This is of tremendous national consequence," said Richard Blumenthal, the State Attorney General, "staking the towns and cities, land use, tax revenues and local control against the desire of Indian tribes to expand the geographical areas of their reservations and thereby enhance their gaming operations."
"We oppose annexation so long as the towns take that position," he said. "All we can do is appeal to Federal authorities who have ultimate decision-making power and vast discretion."
He said he suspected that there were officials within the Department of the Interior who favored annexation, and that Bruce Babbitt, the Secretary of the Interior, was "seeking to strike a balance."
Lawyers for the tribe and the towns declined to comment on the situation while negotiations were proceeding.
Madeline Jeffery, president of the 275-member North Stonington Land Alliance and a founding member of the recently formed No Annexation Not One Acre citizen's group, said annexation was unacceptable.
"It's a loss of the democratic process," she said. "Normally we could go to the Selectmen or the Planning and Zoning Commission when we object to a proposed development. But here we are dealing with a 'sovereign government.' "
At issue are 247 acres in Ledyard and North Stonington, for which the tribe applied for trust status early last year. It plans to join thatwith 1,000 acres of a former Boy Scout camp it bought and build a park, possibly with an Asian theme.
The application, perceived by many residents as opening the door to a cascade of future annexations, prompted a joint referendum last November. Out of a three-town population of 26,800, there are 13,795 registered voters; 4,034 voted against annexation, 1,020 for it.
Though the vote carries no legal weight it provided an impetus for Mr. Babbitt to refer the matter to mediation by the Conflict Management Group of Cambridge, Mass., a nonprofit organization that has so far been unable to resolve the issues.
"PLANS for the park are misunderstood," said Jackson T. King, Jr., legal counsel to the tribe. "We are talking about water gardens, Chinese architecture, quiet places for meditation, not the Ferris wheels and carnival atmosphere that people envision."
"We have just bought an additional 375-acre site," he continued, "containing a silica mine that we will close, and a hiking trail system that we will preserve and enhance for the public and guests of Foxwoods. People should look at what we have done and how we are stewards of the land."
To offset tax losses from annexation the tribe offered each town $1 million a year for five years and negotiation at the end of that period. But Joyce Elias, tax assessor for North Stonington, said that this approach ignored basic principles of valuation.
"Unless there is a calculated formula you are only getting today's value in future years," she said. "And if the theme park goes in, the homes near it will become worthless to buyers other than the tribe." As the tribe hires more and more people the towns will become bedroom communities for the casino, she predicted.
This analysis may already explain in the listless market for commercial and industrial development, which officials in the area are hoping will replace the military-oriented industry.
"With an increased reliance on a gaming economy, it is not likely that major companies will site a new plant or distribution center in the middle of an environment that is generally regarded as negative for employee families," said William M. Newman, broker and appraiser with Connecticut Commercial Realty in New London.
"We are probably going to see the development of retail and service businesses, shopping centers, nightclubs, motels and restaurants, in anticipation of increased traffic into the area," Mr. Newman said.
That process has begun on Route 2, the main artery leading to the casino from Hartford; from Massachusetts via I-395 and from Rhode Island, New York and coastal Connecticut via I-95. Gas stations, shopping strips and restaurants on Route 2 are sprucing up and motels are doing well.
But four new traffic lights have been installed on the eight-mile stretch of Route 2 in North Stonington, from Exit 92 of I-95 to the casino, to regulate the increased traffic. The 57-square-mile town, with a population of 5,000, previously had only one set of traffic lights, which converted to a blinker in winter.
"North of the casino," said Richard Martinez, planning administrator for the state's Department of Transportation, "toward Hartford, there were 7,000 cars clocked daily in both directions in 1990; in 1993 there were 21,500. South of the casino to North Stonington there were 7,200 cars in 1990; in 1993 there were 18,500." His department is conducting an 18-month study of options for widening Route 2.
"Unfortunately for people who live on roads where traffic has increased," said Stanley Steinberg, a Ledyard real estate broker, "their home prices have decreased, and selling them will be difficult." Conversely, home and condominium sales in the region have risen 15.4 percent over last year, and prices have increased by 2.4 percent, according to The Commercial Record, a Connecticut business weekly.
"It's the tribe's right to buy land," said Ms. Jeffery, "but annexation would change our lives forever.
"Why can't we live peacefully together as we have for generations?"

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Why Pay To Insure A Rental?

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS 

 BODY:
RENTERS, including the thousands of students going back to school these days, should be aware that one of the classic mistakes is to discount the importance of household insurance.
O.K., so they don't have Aubusson rugs or Cartier jewelry. But they may have expensive computer and other electronic equipment, VCR's, boom boxes, sports gear and so forth, which together may also be worth thousands of dollars. 
 Still, slightly less than half of all tenants bother to protect their personal belongings and furnishings with insurance, according to industry estimates, with younger people particularly lax.
Barbara Wick, senior vice president with Condominium Insurance Specialists of America, based in Arlington Heights, Ill., puts the figure as low as 25 percent in ongoing surveys that her company has taken in buildings that it manages.
"After a major fire or water loss it can be quite tragic," she said.
Yet unfortunately, in New York State, the number of insured renters is likely to shrink even more. Last December the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal issued an opinion letter stating that owners of rent-stabilized apartments could not require a tenant to buy renters' insurance as a condition of being granted a lease. The opinion was offered in response to an inquiry from a Bronx law firm that represents apartment owners.
Although it may have made sense for people who really do have little of value, it sends an unfortunate message to everyone else because a tenant policy is one of the great insurance bargains.
"I was quite shocked at how low the premiums were compared to auto or medical insurance," said Jackson Peng, owner of the Asia Restaurant on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, after shopping for renters' insurance a few years ago.
For example, a basic policy from State Farm Insurance that offers $20,000 of coverage with a $250 deductible plus $100,000 worth of personal liability costs just $84 a year for a renter in Westchester County and $140 in Manhattan (one of the highest-cost areas of the country). This type of policy also covers home-based computer equipment up to $5,000. USAA, a company based in San Antonio that specializes in covering military and former service personnel and their families, has a tenant protection plan costing $169 a year in New York (with no differential by location) that insures $20,000 worth of belongings, with a $100 deductible. It also includes $100,000 of personal liability and replacement cost coverage. This means it will pay to replace, say, a 10-year-old TV set, not just provide the cash equivalent of the TV's value at the time of the loss.
Still, tenant policies are continually dismissed as unnecessary, usually in the mistaken belief that the landlord can be held responsible for virtually everything that might go wrong.
"If water gets into the apartment or there's a fire or a robbery, it doesn't necessarily mean the landlord was negligent," said Carla Vel, a vice president at Kaye Insurance Associates of Manhattan.
Ms. Wick, the other insurance specialist, was so convinced of the same need that she made sure her 27-year-old daughter in student housing carried a renters' policy. So does her 25-year-old son.
Indeed, say experts, even when the landlord can be charged with negligence, it could cost more than it would probably be worth to hire a lawyer to fight the case.
Further, the liability portion of the policy, a relatively new phenomenon in renters' insurance, is something that many people should find comforting in these litigious times.
"What if you're the one who lets the bathtub overflow and you get sued by your downstairs neighbor," asks Ms. Vel. "Or you're walking along the street and poke someone in the eye with your umbrella." Some off-premises losses can be covered, too.
The typical renters' coverage is known as an HO4. It can either be written in a comprehensive form for "all risks" or for "named perils" only, the latter being about 20 percent cheaper because the losses it covers are more limited. But named perils should cover fire, theft or water damage, the primary hazards for a renter.
How much coverage you need depends, of course, on the value of your belongings. "The question you have to ask yourself is: 'How much can I stand to lose?' " said Mr. Peng, the restaurant owner.
Mr. Peng also reasoned that in an urban area like New York City theft was a particularly acute possibility. So it did not pay to scrimp. He pays $280 a year for $30,000 worth of coverage with a $200 deductible.
More and more renters are also making sure they get replacement cost coverage since the premium for this benefit, if it's not automatically included, is usually no more than an extra 10 percent.
But how do you make a reasonable estimate? The best way, say insurance experts, is to take a detailed inventory of all furnishing and personal belongings. And most insurance companies and independent agents will provide a worksheet as a guide through the process.
Using the worksheet also prompts the applicant to include items that might be overlooked, such as collectibles, said Wendell Wardell, product planner and development manager at State Farm.
It may also alert the renter to the need for separate coverage for individual items of value if they do have some of those jewels or expensive art work. The Pengs, for instance, also took out an off-premises rider that helped them when Cynthia Peng had her handbag stolen in a midtown hotel two years ago.
But not every rental situation is necessarily acceptable. As with auto insurance, it's difficult to get coverage if you've had a history of multiple claims on past rental policies.
State Farm, for example, tends to exclude anyone who has had more than three or four theft claims during the prior two years. It also examines the condition of the rental structure and may exclude buildings that are poorly maintained or have antiquated mechanical systems, such as inadequate wiring.
So it even pays for a landlord to take the necessary steps to make sure that renters' insurance will be available to a tenant, since it's in their interest to promote policies that avoid law suits, too.
Indeed, despite the New York State regulators' position, actually requiring a tenant to do so is something that lawyers increasingly advise landlords. It helps clarify, immediately, that there is a limit to any landlord's responsibilities. And this, in turn, helps prevent the owner from getting embroiled in endless arguments and prolonged litigation later on, too.

HEADLINE: How Tyson Became the Chicken King

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: SPRINGDALE, Ark.

 BODY:
Don Tyson, the chairman of Tyson Foods and America's chicken king, had the flushed look of a kid caught sneaking a peek at an X-rated videotape. Two other company executives also appeared mildly embarrassed to be discovered huddled around a television at the sleek headquarters building, where Andy Warhol competes for wall space with mounted marlins.
"Oh, uh, we're just watching a commercial for, uh, Butterball turkeys," muttered Mr. Tyson as one of the other men reached quickly to shut off the television. "Gotta be going anyway." 
 Only after the boss departed did one of the participants confess. They had been watching a videotape called "The Clinton Chronicles," an 83-minute, innuendo-filled attack on President Clinton that contains inflammatory allegations about Mr. Tyson's relations with his fellow Arkansan in the White House.
Tyson Foods Inc. is the world's largest poultry producer and processor, but its name has been in the headlines more often lately because of its ties to President Clinton and his Administration.
First came the disclosure that Tyson's general counsel had guided Hillary Rodham Clinton's unusually profitable trading in cattle futures. Then the Justice Department recommended appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate whether Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy violated the law by accepting plane rides, lodging and football tickets from Tyson.
In a sure sign things are not going well, Tyson's troubles wound up in a David Letterman late-night monologue. In a jab the other night at Mr. Espy's flights, Mr. Letterman deadpanned: "Good news, ladies and gentlemen. President Clinton today announced that the Tyson chicken company will be flying American combat troops to Haiti free."
The folks at Tyson are not laughing. "It's time-consuming and tiresome," groused the 64-year-old Mr. Tyson recently between bites of garlic chicken at Herman's Ribhouse, his favorite restaurant in nearby Fayetteville. "I could be doing something productive."
The poultry business is not nuclear power or airlines. But it is highly regulated, from state laws restricting truck weight to Federal inspectors who work alongside employees in plants. This means a company Tyson's size gets plenty of opportunities to brush up against the politicians who set policy and the regulators who enforce it.
"We don't make the system," said Archie Schaffer 3d, Tyson's director of media and government affairs, "but we have to play in it.'
And Tyson is a big player. From a one-truck business started by Mr. Tyson's father in the Depression, the company mushroomed from its Arkansas roots into a global empire through market innovations and a hardball acquisition strategy. It ranks 110th on the Fortune list of America's 500 largest companies, with $5.2 billion in sales projected for this year. It sells 6,000 food products in 57 countries, from fresh chickens to taco fillings. And it has made Don Tyson a very wealthy man, worth an estimated $800 million.
 
 
'Grow-or-Die' Philosophy
 Now, the company faces a risky new challenge as it tests the next phase of Mr. Tyson's "grow-or-die" philosophy. Tyson's business acumen -- as well as its political firepower -- is trained on the fishing industry, where the company hopes to replicate its success with chickens. The record is dismal so far, but no one familiar with the company is ready to write it off.
"Time will fix Tyson's seafood business and bring it into the operating story of the company," said John C. Bierbusse, an analyst with A. G. Edwards in St. Louis.
So far, the story of Tyson has been the story of chicken. Driven by health concerns and lower prices, Americans nearly doubled their chicken consumption in the last 20 years. Chicken surpassed beef as the most popular main course in the American diet. So businesses grew and consolidated. What was once a small regional industry run by families is now a true agribusiness in which 20 companies control 79 percent of production.
As the dominant company, Tyson slaughters 29 million chickens a week, producing twice as much chicken as second-ranking ConAgra and nearly three times as much as Frank Perdue's Perdue Farms. Tyson chicken shows up in 88 of the top 100 restaurant chains, in everything from McDonald's Chicken McNuggets to KFC's new rotisserie gold, both of which Tyson helped develop.
Tyson is the leading chicken supplier in Japan. This year, it will ship 300 million pounds of chicken to Russia, mostly leg quarters which are not as popular in the United States. Pursuing its next bonanza, Tyson executives were in China last week seeking Government approval for poultry ventures there.
In its drive to dominate the "center-of-the-plate" protein business, the company is now the nation's second-largest producer of hogs and is expanding its beef processing capacity. To complete the menu, Tyson bought the largest at-sea fishing processing fleet, Seattle-based Arctic Alaska Fisheries, in 1992.
But this month the diversification drive stung the company twice, raising questions about whether Tyson is overreaching. First, plans to grab a big share of the turkey industry failed when WLR Foods, the second-largest turkey producer, rebuffed a hostile bid led by Mr. Tyson himself.
 
 
Tyson's First Write-Off
 Then Tyson took the first major write-off in its history because of troubles at Arctic Alaska. The $205 million charge against earnings in the quarter that ended June 30 left the company with a per-share loss of $1 for the period. Still, investors are confident that most of Tyson's problems in the fishery business are behind it. Its stock price has remained steady in the $24-a-share range.
When the company started out, it had no financial cushion to absorb errors. John Tyson, a produce hauler from Kansas, was driving through the small Ozark Mountain town of Springdale in 1930 when his truck ran out of gas. He stayed, began hauling fruit for local orchards and branched out to chickens. Soon, he was delivering poultry throughout the Southeast and the Midwest.
As business grew, Mr. Tyson found that growers sometimes did not have enough birds to keep him busy. So he bought a hatchery and produced baby chicks for the growers. By the late 1940's, Mr. Tyson had added a farm, a feed mill and growing houses, pioneering the concept of vertical integration in the industry.
His son left the University of Arkansas in his senior year to join his father in 1952. Don Tyson became the company's president in 1966, three years after it went public. By that time, he was already responsible for a major breakthrough.
The poultry business had always been cyclical. In 1965, Mr. Tyson sought refuge from the boom-or-bust cycles by inventing Rock Cornish game hens, named for the cross breeding of two types of chicken.
Nothing more than young female chickens under two pounds, Mr. Tyson sold them to markets as specialty items for 50 cents each, a higher profit than chickens sold by the pound and a price that was not tied to daily fluctuations.
Mr. Tyson took over as chairman of the company after his father and stepmother were killed in an accident in 1967, when their car was struck by a train. A replica of John Tyson's office in the corporate headquarters contains a clock stopped at the time of his death. Much of what the son has done since is a variation on the game hen theme of extracting more value from the basic product, chicken.
 
 
Time for Sale
 "It was pretty much Don's vision that fueled the company," said Mark A. Plummer, an analyst at Stephens Inc. in Little Rock. "He saw that if you added more convenience by further processing the chicken, consumers would pay for it."
Processed chicken was Tyson's biggest boom. They debone it, marinate it, cut it into pieces, press it into patties, roll it into nuggets, bread it, batter it, cook it and freeze it. In return, processed products command a premium price over fresh chicken.
"We're really selling time along with quality and convenience," said Mr. Tyson over lunch at Herman's, where the chicken on the menu -- garlic, barbecued or Cajun -- was from Tyson. "We produce it and you assemble it."
Modern processing plants are a far cry from grabbing a chicken by the neck and whacking off its head. Live chickens empty onto a conveyor belt that leads to a darkened room, where workers hang them upside down from U-shaped shackles on an assembly line. The birds are stunned with an electric shock, their throats slit by machine and they move through boiling water to loosen the feathers. Machines massage off the feathers, eviscerate and wash the birds inside and out, and slice them into pieces.
Seventy birds a minute move down the line, the maximum allowed by the Department of Agriculture. Government inspectors work alongside Tyson employees, inspecting chickens as they move toward the breading, cooking and freezing operations.
Nothing is wasted. Feathers, heads, blood and internal organs are collected and sent to a Tyson rendering plant to become ingredients in chicken and cattle feed and pet food. Chicken feet, called paws, are shipped to China for use in soups and appetizers.
A few years ago, Mr. Tyson noticed a surplus of gizzards, since fewer birds were sold with innards. He thought he could earn some money by finding a use for them. And the gizzard burger was born.
"Gizzards are high in protein, so we ground 'em up and added hamburger flavor," recalled Mr. Tyson. "The price was a third to a half what hamburger cost."
Gizzard patties were first marketed in the Watts section of South-Central Los Angeles. They were a flop. Undeterred, Mr. Tyson made use of his legendary Arkansas connections.
"I figured we'd try a captive market," he said. "I called a man I knew in the prison system. He agreed to serve gizzard burgers to the prisoners. Well, the first time they served them, he called me up and said, 'Don, if we try to serve'em again, these prisoners are gonna riot.' "
Laughing loudly, Mr. Tyson added, "You know, you could almost eat those gizzard burgers."
Along with more than 60 poultry, beef and pork processing plants nationwide, Tyson operates 24 feed mills, 35 hatcheries and 36 fishing and processing ships. Through its Mexican food line, Tyson is one of the nation's largest tortilla makers.
But chicken still dominates, accounting for $3 out of every $4 of the company's sales. Processed chicken accounts for 71 percent of those sales, with fresh and chilled pieces and whole birds making up the rest.
 
 
Close to the Edge
 Tyson revenues have increased sevenfold in the last decade and profits have risen from $18.1 million in 1984 to a projected $200.1 million this year. About half of the growth has come from internal expansion. The other half came by acquiring more than 20 other companies.
In an industry where companies are often highly leveraged, Tyson regularly plays close to the edge. Its debt-to-capital ratio of 45 percent reflects the company's aggressive financial stance. So far, Tyson has come up a winner.
The biggest acquisition -- and the biggest win -- was the 1989 purchase of Holly Farms for $1.5 billion. Holly was the second-largest chicken producer behind Tyson and it had been set to merge with ConAgra. Mr. Tyson unleashed a bitter, two-year fight and finally prevailed in a battle that demonstrated his dogged determination to maintain industry dominance.
"We had to have Holly," explained Mr. Tyson. "If ConAgra had bought Holly, they would have been No. 1.
Being No. 1 carries more than bragging rights in the food business. The biggest companies get the most shelf space in supermarkets and the most clout with big customers such as restaurant chains and the growing wholesale club market.
Tyson's tactics have won it admirers and critics in the industry. Earlier this year, when Tyson went after WLR Foods, the turkey producer in Broadway, Va., it employed a full media blitz accusing WLR management of putting their jobs ahead of shareholder interests in rejecting the bid of $30 a share for stock selling around $20. But shareholders rejected Tyson five times.
"I admire a lot of what I see about the Tyson company, but I don't agree one bit with the way Don Tyson continued his hostile takeover attempt of our company," said James L. Keeler, president and chief executive of WLR.
Despite its bare-knuckle demeanor, Tyson maintains a homespun atmosphere reminiscent of another Arkansas entrepreneur, the late Sam Walton. All Tyson executives, including the chairman, wear the same khaki uniform, with their first name stitched on the shirt. Anyone who refers to their 54,000 co-workers as "employees" instead of "people" is fined a quarter.
 
 
Corporate Myth
 Part of this corporate populism is the myth that the wealthy Mr. Tyson lives simply in the modest house he built 30 years ago. In fact, he spends about two weeks a month on his 62-foot boat fishing for marlin from Mexico to Africa. His trophies dot the company headquarters, topped by the head of a 1,100-pound black marlin. He drives a jet-black, $45,000 Range Rover and owns homes in Fayetteville, Little Rock, England and Baja, California.
Mr. Tyson and his wife, Jean, have been separated for two decades, but this year he built her a 7,000-square-foot limestone house on 33 acres just down Johnson Road from the corporate headquarters.
As the empire has grown, so have efforts to protect it. That means courting politicians and contributing to campaigns. Mr. Tyson routinely makes his Baja house available to the Arkansas Poultry Federation for fishing junkets by legislators. The company's political action committee, called Typac, has contributed $99,800 to candidates for Senate and House seats in the 1993-94 Federal election cycle.
Two years ago, Mr. Tyson, family members and company executives gave $29,000 to Mr. Clinton's presidential campaign, and Mr. Tyson was favored as one of the few corporate executives to speak at Mr. Clinton's pre-inauguration economic summit in Little Rock.
Along with airplane rides, meals and lodging for Mr. Espy and a companion, Mr. Tyson and company employees contributed $6,000 to help retire the campaign debt of the Agriculture Secretary's brother, Henry, who lost a bid for Congress in 1993.
It was the same year the Agriculture Department shelved work on new poultry inspection regulations. Only after congressional pressure did it resume the work this year. Mr. Espy has denied engaging in any misconduct and Tyson officials say they support stricter inspections and were not trying to influence him.
Tyson is counting on political help to recover from its uncharacteristic stumble in the fish business. Many in the industry scoffed that Tyson overpaid when it bought Arctic Alaska for $212 million. Then the market collapsed for surimi, the imitation crab and lobster meat that is Arctic Alaska's biggest product. Prices plunged to 50 cents a pound from $2 after the Japanese reduced their purchases. In addition, the Russian Government has refused to allow Arctic Alaska boats to fish its waters, something Tyson had counted on.
 
 
Grand Strategy
 "It still fits our grand strategy of being a center-of-the-plate protein provider," said Leland E. Tollett, Tyson's chief executive and president.
Tyson officials believe success lies partly in revamping management of fish harvesting in the Pacific Northwest. Under the current system, appointed management councils determine the size of the catch and set the season. Tyson wants a quota system, which would divide the annual catch into shares. Companies could leisurely fish their shares, lease them or sell them. By ending the current race for fish in a short season, the process would be safer and more efficient, Mr. Tyson said.
Smaller fishermen oppose the change. They argue it would give Tyson an unfair advantage by allowing it to purchase or lease other shares -- and monopolize the fish industry the way it has chicken.
To get its views across, Tyson hired Alaska Governor Walter Hickel's personal attorney, along with a top lobbyist. However, the final decision will be made in Washington, where some Alaskans fear Tyson wields more influence.
"Tyson felt they are not getting a fair shake in the Pacific Northwest and they want to shift things back to Washington," said Dennis Phelan, a lobbyist for interests opposed to changing the system.
To lobby on fish-related issues, Tyson recently hired Ralph Everett, a senior staff member of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Glenn R. Delaney, who worked on the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee.
The efforts have begun to pay some dividends, although quotas face a bitter fight. On Aug. 4, Senator John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, introduced a bill to strip the management councils of much of their power, a move supported by Tyson.
Senator Breaux received $4,000 in contributions from Mr. Tyson and other company executives in his last race and Mr. Delaney used to work for him. Senator Breaux said he talked with Mr. Delaney, but he said the bill was aimed at ridding the council system of conflicts of interest, not helping Tyson.
Mr. Schaffer said, "All we want is a fair and safe system for managing the fisheries."

HEADLINE: Population Growth Is Anything but Harmless

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Surely you published Julian L. Simon's "Population Distraction" (Op-Ed, Aug. 21) only because of his prominence during the Reagan-Bush years, not for its "facts" or the validity of his position. Mr. Simon remains stuck in the now thoroughly discredited theory that rapid population growth is harmless. 
 Before 1980 there was indeed no correlation between population growth in developing countries and economic development. After 1980, however, yearly income growth was 1.23 percent in the 41 developing countries with below-average population growth, whereas in the 41 with faster population growth, average yearly income fell by 1.25 percent. This relationship held true everywhere.
Common sense belies Mr. Simon's theory. In sub-Saharan Africa, with minimal access to family planning, children younger than 5 total twice the number of adults 20 to 24 years old, four times the number of those 40 to 44 and 10 times the number of those 65 to 69. The population has a 23-year doubling period, per capita food production is falling, illiteracy is the norm, and malnutrition is rampant. The work force is so debilitated by AIDS and overwhelmed by dependents that saving is almost impossible. The entire continent produces less than the Netherlands.
Mr. Simon belittles the Cairo population conference and would have us do nothing. Happily, Congress disagrees. Though reducing total foreign aid appropriations for next year, it increased population assistance by 18 percent.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Interior Secretary Endures Storms From All Directions

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
INTERIOR SECRETARY BRUCE BABBITT has been fighting forest fires this summer, donning a yellow fireproof shirt and taking up a shovel in hot spots from the Colorado Rockies to the Washington Cascades. He says he enjoys staring down a wall of flames.
Fires may actually be a relief compared with the heat Mr. Babbitt has faced from the two extremes in the debate over how to manage nearly 500 million acres of public land. In Wyoming last month, Mr. Babbitt surprised opponents when he showed up at a barbecue and ranchers' rally against his policies. Beef was on the spit, but the grill was hottest under Mr. Babbitt. Speaker after speaker ridiculed the 56-year-old Interior Secretary. Through it all, he chatted and swapped stories with the crowd, as if he were just another cowboy. 
 On the other side of the land-use divide, some environmental leaders say they have all but given up on Mr. Babbitt, calling him the kind of names that seldom find their way into organic farm monthlies. The man whom the Wilderness Society heralded as "our Babe Ruth" when he was appointed last year is now viewed by some members as something closer to Bob Uecker.
Mr. Babbitt, a third-generation Westerner from a prominent Arizona ranching family, says he relishes the heat. Recently, after four hours' give-and-take with Western senators who are fighting to hold on to century-old subsidies for mining, grazing and timber interests, he came away looking refreshed. "I love it," said Mr. Babbitt, who picked up part of his debating skills from the priests at the University of Notre Dame, where he was student body president. "Bring 'em on."
But if Mr. Babbitt remains unbloodied in his fight to change the way America's vast public domain is managed, some of his major policy initiatives are in tatters. He came into office vowing that 1993 will be the year of reform on public lands.
Yet his plan to raise grazing fees paid by the ranchers who run livestock over 280 million acres of public land was stymied first in the Senate, where it was filibustered to death, and later in the West, where vocal and occasionally militant opponents packed hearings run by their allies in the Senate. A small increase in grazing fees, barely above the level paid 15 years ago, will go into effect next year, Mr. Babbitt now says.
But this is not enough for people who waited through 12 years of Republican administrations to get some changes in the grazing policies. "The year of public land reform turned into the year of public land retreat," said Jeff DeBonis, the head of a group of Federal employees who favor more environmental changes in the agencies that govern Federal land.
Mr. Babbitt made a big splash in trying to end the 1872 mining law, which allows companies to take billions of dollars in gold and silver from public lands without paying anything in royalties. The law's biggest beneficiaries are foreign-owned companies, which dominate mining in the United States. But a bill to overhaul the law, passed by a 3-to-1 ratio in the House, is now stalled in the Senate, where some Westerners have again threatened to filibuster.
His biggest fight, over reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act, will come next year. Mr. Babbitt has recently appeared at press conferences with the leaders of the timber and sugar industries, heralding their cooperation in his effort to show that saving creatures in peril is not the Rush Limbaugh nightmare its opponents describe. But courting the business leaders may not be enough to stave off a run at the act, which is considered the most powerful environmental law on the books.
"Babbitt made a real blunder in trying to take on the grazing, mining and timber industries all at once," said Phil Hocker, head of the Mineral Policy Center, which tracks mining. "So now the Republicans see this as a way to score political points against the Democrats."
Western senators, emboldened by the success in stalling grazing and mining reforms, say Mr. Babbitt is conducting "a war on the West," and that the Democrats will pay dearly for it in the next Presidential election. Mr. Clinton took 7 of the 11 Western states in 1992.
The vast majority of Westerners, says Mr. Babbitt, are with him, and he points to polls showing that in most Western states up to 80 percent of the people want mining and grazing laws to change. Ranchers and mining employees make up less than 1 percent of all workers in the West, and he says they have painted a distorted picture of what he is trying to do. Indeed, opponents are hard-pressed to point to a single thing he has accomplished which is directly hurting them.
Just as James G. Watt helped to galvanize the environmental movement against him when he was Ronald Reagan's Interior Secretary, Mr. Babbitt is a fund-raising draw for the extraction industries.
"Babbitt is helping us raise a lot of money," said Barbara Grannell, the director of People for the West, a group supported by mining, ranching and logging interests. "What Bruce Babbitt is about is control. He's trying to control how people use the land and water."
Environmentalists are in a deep funk. "There is a good chance he has lost control of the agenda," said Jon Roush, president of the Wilderness Society. "The people who oppose him are people who want it all, and they are accustomed to getting it all."
The same criticism has been made of environmentalists, who tend to desert political leaders at the first sign of compromise. Supporters of Mr. Babbitt say he has had little, if any, help from President Clinton, who early on traded away a stiff grazing-fee increase to win Senate votes on his economic policies. Twice, the President has dangled Mr. Babbitt's name as a possible Supreme Court nominee, but has made few other public mentions of him or his efforts.
 
Casualties of Office
 The job itself has inherent conflicts, and a high casualty rate. One long-ago Interior Secretary collapsed of a nervous breakdown 13 days into the job, and another, Albert Fall, was convicted in the 1920's Teapot Dome scandal of accepting a bribe to lease an oil reserve and was sentenced to prison.
Mr. Babbitt may be most effective from the bully pulpit, using the same tool that one of his conservationist heroes, Teddy Roosevelt, used. He has made strong speeches about national parks, saving wild places such as the California desert and keeping the Federal Government out of the dam-building business.
"Under my watch, the National Park Service is not going to be in the hotel business," he said earlier this summer, siding with critics who feel the parks have become too cluttered by commercial establishments. He recently evoked Teddy Roosevelt, saying a supporter had urged him to do what Roosevelt did in 1907, when he infuriated the timber industry by creating large forest reserves. One goal which Mr. Babbitt may actually be able to reach is a bit more modest. He says, simply, that he is determined to become one of the first Interior secretaries to finish a four-year term.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: Best of Enemies;
Castro, the Man With Few Cards, Always Winds Up the Dealer

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
HIS country may be crumbling around him, its economy reduced to ruins and its people so disgusted with their situation that some have marched in the streets of Havana this month, openly demanding his ouster. But for all his problems at home, Fidel Castro still retains a remarkable ability to bedevil the United States and to transfer the burden of his own domestic failings to the adversary he has fought with such gusto and relish for more than 35 years.
In what has become a rite of passage for every American President since Eisenhower, Bill Clinton is now learning that lesson the hard way. The internal crisis that began less than a month ago with boat hijackings and a riot in Havana has quickly been transformed into a crisis of American foreign and immigration policy, with the United States now forced to provide temporary refuge at places like the Guantanamo Bay naval base for the more than 16,000 disenchanted Cubans intercepted as they headed for Florida aboard rickety rafts. As was the case during the 1980 exodus from the port of Mariel, Mr. Castro, playing a weak hand with consummate skill, is now dictating the course and tempo of events while Washington, with far more resources at its disposal, struggles to respond. 
 "Everything that he is doing today is consistent with what he has always done, which is to be creative with his limited options," said Tad Szulc, who wrote the biography "Fidel: A Critical Portrait" with the Cuban leader's cooperation. "He has been doing this for a living for 35 years, and realizes he has only one card to play, the weapon of the refugees. He needs the breathing space and knows that the only way to get it is to force the Americans into a dialogue."
If anything, Mr. Castro seems energized by his clash with a young, untested President, whose foreign policy staff includes many of the same officials who were also involved in Mariel. In eclipse since the collapse of the Soviet bloc five years ago, his image tarnished by reports of Cubans going hungry and the collapse of the health and education programs that were the proudest achievements of the Cuban Revolution, the Maximum Leader is back on the front lines and in the international limelight again, leading the efforts to quell internal discontent and cut the yanquis down to size.
Mr. Castro comes well-equipped to the latest confrontation with his "closest of enemies," as Wayne Smith, former head of the United States Interests Section in Havana, describes the United States-Cuba relationship. He is known to be an avid viewer of CNN on the satellite dish that was Ted Turner's gift to him a decade ago, and, Mr. Szulc said, not only sees that Mr. Clinton has his hands full with domestic legislation and with Bosnia, Korea and Haiti, but knows how to use that knowledge to his own benefit. He is also well aware that the United States, given its values and domestic political pressures, cannot afford to send back the "anti-social elements" he is encouraging to leave, even though Mr. Clinton has reversed the longstanding policy of automatically granting asylum to fleeing Cubans.
"Fidel is a shrewd student of United States society, institutions and government," Jose Luis Llovio Menendez, an ex-Cuban official, wrote in "Insider," an account of his 17 years in the revolutionary elite. He said Mr. Castro "understands the limitations on a President's power to act in many critical circumstances. This knowledge informs his every strategic maneuver."
As Mr. Castro's oldest associates tell it, that has always been the case. "He knew from the beginning that to be a great man he had to confront a great power," Carlos Franqui, one of Mr. Castro's earliest comrades in arms, said in an interview. In a letter written in June 1958 while still in the Sierra Maestra fighting the Batista dictatorship, Mr. Castro said of the United States that "when this war is over, a much longer and larger war will begin for me: the war I'm going to wage against them. I realize that this will be my destiny."
More often than not, of course, Mr. Castro has found the United States only too happy to oblige that ambition. Ludicrous assassination schemes, the botched Bay of Pigs invasion and diplomatic campaigns aimed at isolating him internationally all added to his revolutionary luster, remaining propaganda fodder for Havana long after the United States pledged, as part of the solution to the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, not to use force to overthrow Mr. Castro.
Occasionally, however, Washington has shown itself able to defuse challenges Mr. Castro has manufactured. In September 1965, for example, in an immigration crisis handled so deftly that it has been largely forgotten, Mr. Castro announced that any malcontents were welcome to leave from the port of Camarioca. Over the next month, more than 5,000 Cubans took to sea in small vessels of every type, straining the ability of the Coast Guard to intercept and assist them.
The Johnson Administration, preoccupied with Vietnam and fearing a tragedy in the Straits of Florida, quickly proposed an open-ended refugee airlift if Mr. Castro would call a halt to the exodus. He accepted the offer, and the ensuing "freedom flights" lasted into the 1970's, bringing more than 200,000 Cubans to the United States with virtually no fanfare or any real political cost for either side.
"That is the model Cuba likes for migration, and Castro said as much" last week in a rambling speech on Cuban TV, said Lisandro Perez, director of the Cuba Research Institute at Florida International University. "He wants an escape valve that is orderly and drawn out and not very splashy." This time, Mr. Castro's call for high-level negotiations was rejected, though the Administration said yesterday it would like to quickly resume mid-level talks on migration with the aim of stemming the flow of refugees.
In fact, though Mr. Castro likes to portray American policy toward his revolution as one of unrelenting hostility, the record indicates otherwise. All nine presidents since the days of Eisenhower have sought to take the approach recommended by then-Vice President Richard Nixon as he emerged from his Washington office with his arm around the Cuban leader after they met there in April 1959: "We're going to work with this man."
Mr. Nixon himself would later negotiate an anti-air-hijacking agreement with Mr. Castro. And under President Ford, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said he saw no reason for "perpetual antagonism between Cuba and the U.S." In 1975, the United States even voted with the majority at the Organization of American States to end sanctions against Cuba, and under Jimmy Carter, an even broader initiative was launched.
 
The Same Pattern
 But Mr. Castro unilaterally abrogated the anti-hijacking agreement after blaming the United States for the bombing of a Cuban airliner. The Ford initiative collapsed when Cuban troops were sent to fight in Angola's civil war. As for the Carter Administration's efforts to reduce tensions between the two countries, they were answered with Mariel.
Despite those bitter experiences, however, Ronald Reagan was able to put aside his aversion to Communism and reach accords with Mr. Castro on migration and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Africa. "Each and every one of these Presidents came to the conclusion that an important aspect of his Castro crisis required negotiations," said Jorge I. Dominguez, a Cuba expert at Harvard's Center for International Affairs.
With Mr. Clinton, the Cuban leader's behavior thus far has followed much the same pattern. "Every time an American President takes office, Castro starts by throwing bouquets," said Mr. Franqui, who fought in the Sierra Maestra with Mr. Castro and wrote "Family Portrait With Fidel" after breaking with him. "But at a certain moment, he always provokes a problem."
In the current crisis, Mr. Castro has repeatedly said his ultimate objective is the lifting of the economic embargo that the United States has maintained on trade with Cuba for more than 30 years. But the embargo has also worked to his benefit, not only because he can blame it for Cuba's economic ills but also because it is easily circumvented, and an American offer to discuss ending the embargo in return for political reforms might well put Mr. Castro in a difficult spot.
"I have always believed he is more afraid of openness than isolation," Dr. Perez said. Lifting the embargo "would allow him greater options for trade, yes, but he doesn't have any money to buy anything. It wouldn't really multiply the possibilities of trade, but it would bring in a flood of ideas and dollars, which are dangerous, and deprive him of a political tool."
Or as Mr. Nixon put it in a book published just before his death this spring, "the plain fact . . . is that after 35 years of Castro's rule, the hard line against him has failed to get rid of him." With the Communist bloc gone, "our best service to the Cuban people now would be to build pressure from within by actively stimulating Cuba's contacts with the free world," Mr. Nixon concluded.
No matter what the outcome of his umpteenth clash with Washington, Mr. Castro plans to stick around. In Colombia three weeks ago, he compared himself to the Great Liberator of the Americas, Simon Bolivar, and vowed to keep on frustrating "those who want to see me away from all this."
"Revolutionaries never abandon the battlefield," he explained. "Revolutionaries do not go into retirement as long as their services and efforts are required."

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE REFUGEES;
Those Reaching Shore Gain a Legal Advantage

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 27

 BODY:
After years of waiting and hoping, three friends from Matanzas, Cuba, savored one day of freedom.
They had spent 15 hours in a 32-foot boat with a good engine that carried them and 35 others across the Straits of Florida until the bow nudged into a muddy shore in darkness near Islamorada, midway up the Florida Keys. Then they tensely waited for dawn to walk to a highway and find a friendly local who spoke Spanish and asked him to call the police. 
 "Estamos aqui," said one of the three, Carlos Manuel Guerra Rodriguez, 28, as he planted a foot on American soil. ("We are here.")
The moment had great emotional meaning for three healthy young men fleeing a Communist society they described as crumbling at the roots.
Fortunately for them, touching American soil also gave them a practical advantage over refugees who are intercepted at sea by Coast Guard or Navy ships and transported to the United States Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Refugees who manage to avoid detection until they make land are being held at the Krome Detention Center outside Miami. Although their future is cloaked in uncertainty by President Clinton's order of indefinite detention, the outlook for them is still brighter than it is for most of the other refugees.
 
On Track for Lawyers
 The Clinton Administration has said that refugees held at Guantanamo will not be processed for admission to the United States. But Mr. Guerra, his boatmates and more than 600 other Cubans now held at Krome and a detention center in Port Isabel, Tex., are already on track to obtain lawyers and apply for political asylum at hearings before administrative judges.
"The minute they touch our shores, they are covered by constitutional guarantees, and each case will be judged on its individual merits," said Walter D. Cadman, Miami district director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. "Refugees taken to Guantanamo clearly do not have that protection or advantage."
For decades, until Aug. 18, when President Clinton reversed United States policy, Cuban refugees held special status. Unlike other illegal aliens, Cubans who reached United States soil, whether by boat or by way of a third country, were immediately paroled into American society without having to go through court hearings to claim political asylum. Now they do.
But, unlike many other illegal aliens, they will not be granted conditional release until a court has decided their status, Mr. Cadman said.
Still, "it is not up to the judge to release them," Mr. Cadman said. "It is up to the I.N.S."
And the immigration agency is empowered to detain refugees if releasing them "might encourage a flood of illegal immigration," Mr. Cadman said.
He said a similar policy was imposed against the surviving illegal Chinese aliens smuggled aboard the Golden Venture, after that ship went aground on Long Island. And he said it had also been used to discourage Haitians from leaving their homeland for Florida in overcrowded boats
 
No Future in Cuba
 If uncertainty clouded their future, it did not show in the faces of Mr. Guerra, trained as a doctor in Cuba, and two of his companions, Luis Alberto Rauco Cabrera, 27, and Rene Cabrera Ruiz, 28. Although dressed in bright orange detention center jump suits, they beamed after agreeing to be interviewed on Friday, saying it was better to be in a detention camp than to stay behind in Cuba.
"No one in Cuba has a future," said Rene Cabrera, a lobster fisherman. Mr. Rauco, his cousin, nodded agreement.
All three expressed hope that they would be released within weeks to join relatives in Miami and to find work. Any kind of work, they said -- "Jobs Americans don't like to do."
They described social and economic conditions in the Matanzas area as sliding toward anarchy since July 1993 when Mr. Castro decriminalized the use of American dollars and permitted Cubans to receive money wired from relatives in the United States.
"Before, without question, Fidel had been a god," Mr. Cabrera said. "But he lost people when he told them that the sick economy was not their concern, that the ideals of the revolution were enough for their sacrifice."
Within the last 12 months, they said, food and clothing shops had been springing up that took only dollars, which could fetch as much as 120 pesos on the black market. People without dollars went hungry, the three men said.
On the streets, they said, people no longer were afraid to criticize Mr. Castro. Neighborhood Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, once the spine of party control and dispensation of favors and punishment, were in disarray and no longer organized volunteer work and other programs, they said.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: WASHINGTON POSTMORTEM;
With Health Overhaul Dead, A Search for Minor Repairs

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
After a year of arguing that making incremental changes in the health care system would make a bad situation worse, the Clinton Administration and its allies are now scrambling to contradict themselves.
They have to, since they acknowledge that Congress will not pass a bill providing health insurance for all Americans by a specified date, which used to be what President Clinton said he had to have. 
 But it is now clear that if anything is to pass, it will be less than that: a bill that tries to fix, not overhaul, the present system, by banning the most objectionable practices of the insurance industry, like refusing to cover sick people, and by scraping together some money to help pay for insurance for people who need it most.
Even that will not be easy in the time remaining before Congress adjourns for the elections.
All year, the energies of Congressional committees have been focused on ways to attain universal coverage, not the best way to do less. And so today, a huge obstacle to action is the cogent, logical case the Administration made against partial change while it was trying to get Congress to do the whole thing.
The argument was that the skyrocketing costs of care could be controlled only in a system in which every American had health insurance. Tinkering with parts of the existing insurance system might just make other problems worse. For example, helping the sick get coverage could raise rates and drive healthy customers away. That kind of thing happened when New York tried this approach. Without universal coverage encouraging preventive care, the system would continue to concentrate on later, more expensive intervention, like taking a baby to an emergency room for a bad cough.
But as Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, once said in explaining why he had reversed a position on health care, "That was then and this is now."
The other piece of the argument against small steps was that this was a moment in history when the public wanted universal care and that it would be a fatal mistake to let Congress off the hook, claiming to have done something vast when it had only niggled.
But the mood now, as Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, put it: "Most people want to be a part of starting something. If we start something, there will never be another Congress that does not address health care."
Senator Harris Wofford, the Pennsylvania Democrat who put this issue on the national agenda when he won an upset victory in 1991, now often reminds his colleagues that the 1957 Civil Rights Act, a modest Federal entry into the problem of discrimination in voting, was seen by many at the time as woefully inadequate, undeserving of support. But it proved to pave the way to a slightly more confident step in 1960 and then to the historic laws of 1964 and 1965. The right first steps now, he contends, could begin a similar journey.
 
Some Good, Some Bad
 In one sense, of course, almost every proposal, starting with President Clinton's, has been incremental, setting out series of advances toward universal coverage over several years. But most were incremental toward something they defined as universal coverage. Now, what it is being discussed are increments toward hope.
And after the speeches against incrementalism, new definitions are required. Today, incrementalism is seen like cholesterol: some is bad but some is good.
Everyone's favorite example of bad incrementalism is New York State's experience with community rating, a system of charging everyone in one area the same insurance rate. The idea of ending rate variations by age is a traditional element of reformist thinking.
But Albany's decision to do that in 1993 led to half a million people dropping their insurance. While rates went down for people in their 60's, they jumped for the young and healthy, so many of them dropped out. That, in turn, raised rates for those who kept their policies, because the pool covered by insurance was now, on the average, sicker.
Everyone's favorite example of good incrementalism is giving the poor, especially the working poor whose incomes are too high for Medicaid, subsidies to help them buy health insurance. Almost every bill before Congress has some plan for subsidies.
But even this idea causes worries. Subsidies for small employers, tried experimentally here and there, have not produced much additional insurance. And if the Government helps the working poor buy their own insurance, which might cost $6,000 a year for a family policy, some employers may stop covering them. Even opponents of requiring employers to insure their workers agree that anything that works against employer-based insurance makes the whole system less efficient.
INSURANCE REGULATION Subsidies cost money, so the area on which there seems to be the most agreement is changing the laws governing insurance.
Dr. Drew Altman, the president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, said the reason for something approaching consensus "is not that it is the most important thing to do, but that it is the only thing for the Congress to do that is free."
Perhaps the broadest agreement, at least generally, is that it would be smart to make it easier for small businesses to band together and get better rates with bigger purchasing power.
Then, there are relatively easy moves, which would solve enormous problems for a small number of people, like forbidding insurance companies from rejecting customers because they are sick and severely limiting how long they can refuse to pay for existing health problems of new customers. Requiring companies to renew policies and not exclude individuals from group policies would also be relatively simple.
Then, there is portability, the term for giving people the right to take their insurance with them when they switch jobs. Despite the glib claims of Republican National Committee advertisements, there is no way to make health insurance truly portable unless all jobs come with health insurance. But Congress may well forbid the kind of six-month waiting periods not uncommon for people who have left their old insurance behind and are not immediately eligible at the new job.
The insurance industry generally supports these changes, although it argues for longer waiting periods before coverage takes effect.
STANDARD BENEFITS Another big idea on the table is establishing a standard benefits package, so that customers can more easily compare insurance policies on the basis of price and quality of service. That idea is central to managed competition, the concept that making the medical industry more of an informed marketplace can curb inflation, as it already has for employers and insurance companies with vast purchasing power. It is a part of the proposals of Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine and the majority leader, and the mainstream coalition with which he is negotiating.
Conservative Republicans have denounced the idea as evidence of a "government knows best attitude." Edward F. Howard, executive vice president of the Alliance for Health Reform, said the argument might be defused if insurers were required to offer the standard policy but allowed to offer others if they wished.
SUBSIDIES Then there are subsidies. The mainstream coalition's plan aims to provide full subsidies to buy insurance for people at the Federal poverty level, now $14,764 for a family of four, and gradually phase out the subsidies up to twice that income. Many Democrats fear that the subsidies, when combined with a series of tax proposals, will in fact encourage employers to stop insuring their workers.
A newly assembled group of Democratic liberals, suggests doing considerably less than that, taking "a minimalist kind of approach," as Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa puts it, involving subsidies for children, 100 percent tax deductibility for the self-employed and a substantial fund to provide community-based long-term care for the elderly and disabled.
The last item, a part of the Mitchell proposal and most Democratic plans (which would also add prescription drug coverage to Medicare benefits), is politically important, because every single plan proposes financing itself substantially through cuts in the rate of growth of Medicare, the Government health plan for the elderly. Its omission from the mainstream plan enraged advocates for the elderly and disabled, who saw cuts but no compensating benefits.
But there seems to be little appetite in Congress to raise taxes to pay for subsidies. (The prospective limits on Medicare spending are a kind of tax on doctors and hospitals, who will be paid less, or on patients, who will be treated less, but the tax is less obvious.)
STATE EXPERIMENTS A final big issue on the agenda is what to do about state experimentation. Those who want greater freedom for states to experiment, like Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the dean of national health insurance advocates in the Senate, argue that if the Federal Government is not ready to lead the way to universal coverage, it ought to get out of the way of states that want to try.
Opponents, led by Senator Dave Durenberger, a Minnesota Republican who dominates the mainstream group on this issue, contend that varying state rules make it impossible for interstate corporations to provide the kind of health care he sees as the wave of the future. The mainstream proposal offers states very limited room to experiment.
One developing consensus, which will be hard for politicians to maintain, is not to boast too much about achieving this kind of agenda, if they can pass it. "Modest is fulsome praise describing these kinds of reforms," said Mr. Howard, of the Alliance for Health Reform. Senator Harkin said, "Let's not pretend it's health care reform."
Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said, "What the President is not prepared to do, is sign a bill that comes to him under the guise of health care reform but does not meet the needs that he laid out."
That could allow him to sign a bill that does more good than harm, even if it does not do a great deal -- so long as it did not pretend to do a great deal.
Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said the other day at a conference at the Capitol that it would be worth taking incremental steps: "Let's do this. It's a very imperfect fit. It's like fixing a car, and in some ways this car is going to get worse, but it will carry you some miles. It does do something. It does make health insurance affordable to chronically ill people and we will lose some healthier young people, who will be moochers. That's not nice, but I think that is the kind of redistribution that might please God, so let's go with that.
"One should not belittle any subsidies that you can tease out of the American upper-income classes and funnel down to the lower income classes. You should take what you can get. If that is all you can get out of this Congress, my advice would be take it, don't pout, take it. It will help at least some people."

'Wait and See' on Health
 EDGARTOWN, Mass., Aug. 27 (Reuters) -- President Clinton will wait to see what Congress produces on health care before deciding whether to veto anything less than universal insurance coverage, the White House said today.
The White House spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, said Mr. Clinton would await the outcome of talks in the Senate, where a bipartisan group backing moderate changes has been negotiating with Senator Mitchell.
She spoke a day after the White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetgta, told reporters that Mr. Clinton might support modest changes in insurance if Congress could not produce the kinds of sweeping changes the President proposed eight months ago.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Highlights: Small Steps on Health Care"
With sweeping proposals for reshaping the health care system all but dead for this year, attention has shifted to more limited measures. Here are some of the major components of what has been called an incremental approach:
 
COMMUNITY RATING
Insurers currently charge different segments of the population, like young and old people, different rates according to how sick they expect each group to be. Under community rating, premiums would be evened out to reflect the average cost of insuring the entire community. Opponents argue that this would unfairly penalize young people and lead many to drop insurance entirely.
 
INSURANCE REGULATIONS
There is broad support for requiring insurers to cover people for illnesses they already have, called pre-existing conditions, and for making insurance "portable," i.e., easy to take from job to job.
 
STANDARD BENEFITS
Many incremental bills would require insurers to offer a guaranteed minimum of benefits, thereby reducing the number of people who are underinsured. Opponents resist this as Government intrusion into a question that should be left to the market to decide.
 
STATE EXPERIMENTS
Health care change is already under way at the state level, but has been limited by a variety of Federal regulations. Some members of Congress want to waive these to encourage innovation; others warn of a patchwork nightmare of laws for businesses that operate across the country.
 
SUBSIDIES
One way to increase coverage is by giving people who now can't afford insurance enough money to buy it. Critics worry that this would create incentives for employers to cut back on coverage, knowing the Government would bail their workers out. The amount of money available is also limited. (pg. 22)

HEADLINE: Along Tobacco Road, a Way of Life Withers

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FARMVILLE, N.C.

 BODY:
It's a drippy 92-degree afternoon at Shackelford's Grocery, which sells Coke in old green bottles and pickled pigs feet from gallon jars. Two barefoot boys, 11 and 12, bound in, carrying primitive fishing poles and exulting over six bass and one bream they caught in Mr. Tyson's pond.
At the four-stool counter, James Shackelford Jr., the store's owner and the son and son-in-law of tobacco farmers, lights a Winston and talks about a friend who lit up at an auto dealership. When the man was told that smoking was not allowed, he tore up his check for a pickup truck and walked out, Mr. Shackelford says. A customer in the store, Bruce Wells, who tended tobacco for years, waves his Cambridge cigarette in the air. "I bought this thing," Mr. Wells says, "so I can still smoke it." 
 But for all the defiant chatter at the grocery store, America's tobacco roads are leading toward a dead end. The tobacco fields here in Pitt County, N.C. -- the biggest-producing county in the biggest-producing state-- no longer pay a family's bills. The culture born of tobacco farming, which has long been the only way to bring big profits from small plots, is fast becoming an artifact.
Pitt County's growers, who produce the flue-cured variety used in cigarettes, have been hurting for some time because of the public attacks on tobacco, from smoking bans to tax increases.
As much as they bristle about all that, the families running the country's 125,000 tobacco farms are struggling with an even bigger, more immediate threat. They face a worldwide glut of low-priced tobacco, with big and growing exporters -- China, Zimbabwe, Brazil and Argentina -- vying for a market that Americans once dominated and selling for prices that are one-half to two-thirds of the American prices.
Both the quality and volume of foreign tobacco production have increased significantly in recent years, the result of improved techniques. Already, foreign competition has contributed to a 10 percent decline in prices for American flue-cured tobacco and a 25 percent decline in the number of tobacco farms in a decade, the Department of Agriculture estimates. Now the glut is likely to accelerate those processes.
To keep prices from plunging as the glut developed last year, the Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corporation, an industry-financed agency in Raleigh, N.C., bought 23 percent of the flue-cured harvest -- 205 million pounds, equal to all of its purchases in the three previous years. Farmers agreed to a 10 percent cut in this year's production to try to stabilize the markets.
Still, the glut persists. Tobacco experts predict an even larger cut in production for 1995.
"I see a possibility that production will be off 20 to 40 percent next year," said Mitchell Smith, the Pitt County agent for the state Cooperative Extension Service.
A production cut of that magnitude would be reflected in farm income. American farmers received $1.5 billion last year from sales of cured tobacco, down from a peak of $1.9 billion in 1981. Verner Grice, the Agriculture Department's top tobacco economist, predicts a decline to $1.35 billion this year. With the harshest blows yet to come, Farmville's town manager, Richard W. Hicks, said, "The effect I've seen so far is fear."
The principal cigarette companies, Philip Morris, R. J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson and Lorillard, still collect handsome profits because they can sell cigarettes abroad, where consumption is still growing, and because they have found a way to exploit the tobacco glut. They import foreign tobacco and blend it with American tobacco, which is still considered a premium product.
 
Forced From the Business
 But here on Farmville's Moye-Turnage Road, at the bottom of the tobacco chain, farmers and farm workers have no protection from the double whammy of imported tobacco and American smoking bans. Scrimping to make ends meet, the farmers have automated to reduce the cost of labor.
The minimum wage of $4.25 an hour and the seasonal nature of the jobs that are left discourage most local workers from taking them. Mexican migrant workers have stepped in.
Scores of farm families on Moye-Turnage, a classic tobacco road, have already been driven out of the business. Moye-Turnage begins just before Shackelford's Grocery, at a granite marker commemorating Alfred Moye, a 19th-century state senator whose great-great-grandson, Joel Moye Jr., grows tobacco farther down the road.
It runs 3.9 miles past three generations of Turnage family homes, past a septic-tank depot and a mobile home park with more than 70 trailers, nearly all occupied by families who do not work in tobacco.
It passes 44 houses, seven of them abandoned. There are 25 abandoned tobacco-curing barns and a dozen newer bulk curing barns.
The road stops at Farmville Central High School, where it becomes Wilson Street and enters Farmville proper, a once bustling and now quiet community of 4,500 that has green and white street signs emblazoned with golden tobacco leaves. In three immense warehouses of tens of thousands of square feet, auctioneers sell the tobacco grown along Moye-Turnage and other roads leading to town.
To make a living, Mr. Shackelford, 34, has started a business removing farmers' underground diesel tanks. He says the store, which he inherited from his father, once bustled. Most farm owners have sold out and moved or have leased their tobacco land to bigger farmers who live elsewhere in Pitt County.
 
'They're Not Here Anymore'
 A. C. Turnage Jr., 66, a retired civil engineer, lives a half-mile from Shackelford's Grocery on land that has been in his family since 1754. He still smokes, but he leaves his cigarettes somewhere he is not -- in the living room when he's in the yard -- so he has to make an effort to get one.
"Watch out for snakes," he warned, prying open the rusted latch to one of his four old stick barns. "We would tie tobacco into bundles, 75 leaves or so, and put them on a stick. You could put 500 sticks in here."
Mr. Turnage was the first in his family to do something other than raise tobacco. He and his wife, Vivian, who also grew up on a tobacco farm, live on the road but lease their six acres to John Moye, who pays them a quarter of his proceeds from selling tobacco grown on the plot.
None of the Turnage children work in tobacco, though they still cling to the road. Mr. Turnage's son, a doctoral student in genetics, lives next door to his parents, in a house that belonged to his grandparents.
Nearby is the new brick home of one of the Turnages' two daughters, a writer. The other daughter, a guidance counselor, lives in the back of the family property.
"My children were all involved in tobacco in the summer," Mr. Turnage said. "But a good deal of the labor that's left has been taken up by migrants. There were 12 houses occupied by black tenant farmers within three miles of here. They're not here anymore. They're not needed anymore."
A neighbor, William Floyd, a 59-year-old farmhand, depends on nothing but tobacco. He lives in a shaky tin-roofed house that his sister rents, its white paint worn away.
"You have to ask these farmers if they need help," Mr. Floyd said, watching the road from the porch. "But most of the time they've got their own help. They bring Mexicans down here now."
He said his only tobacco work, and his only work of any kind so far this year, lasted six weeks in the spring. "I help set it out," he said, transplanting seedlings into rows for $4.25 an hour. "It's the Number 1 job around here in the spring."
Off the road, up a dirt drive amid fields of soybeans and corn, is the weather-worn little home of Ernest and Helen Barnes, who are tenant farmers in their early 70's.
The Barneses have lived in the house for 30 years and raised six children, none of whom work in tobacco. "I used to tend tobacco," Mr. Barnes said. "But it got hard to get the work, so I just let it go."
Mr. Barnes now works four months of the year for minimum wage tending his landlord's corn and beans, and does some odd jobs.
One family on the road makes tobacco pay, if barely. At a bend in the road is the biggest house around, the white Victorian homestead where Joel Moye Jr., 74, grew up. But it stands weathered and empty now, too costly to heat and repair. Mr. Moye and his wife, Christine, and their elder son, Joel 3d, a brick mason, have ranch houses next door. His other son, John, and his family live out back, in an old mobile home.
One afternoon, John Moye is harvesting Mr. Turnage's tobacco with a crew of four. The men ride on boards just off the ground. The machine straddles the plants as Mr. Moye drives it over the rows, and the men break the lowest leaves from the stalk and feed them into a conveyor that stores them on top.
 
From 60 Acres to 27
 John Moye said that 15 years ago he and his father cultivated 60 acres, some of it land that they owned and some land that they leased. Mandated production cuts reduced the figure to 29 acres by last year and to 27 this year. Along with the cut, the price fell.
"If it keeps going the way it is, I'm going to have to find something else to do," he said. He raises soybeans and corn on land he no longer uses for tobacco, but they are not much help. "They wouldn't pay the light bill for one year,' he said.
Downtown, at the end of the road, ashtrays still sit on every store counter. Hassell Aycock-Eason, 34, and her husband, Charles Eason, 36, both nonsmokers, own Main Street Tobaccos, where they sell cartons of cigarettes for as little as $7.41.
Summer downtown used to be a three-month harvest festival, they said. "My daddy used to take me down to the auction," Mrs. Aycock-Eason said. "We had dances at the warehouses." Unlike today, the children helped with the harvest. "You knew what priming, topping, suckering was," Mr. Eason said.
At the big Smith-Bowen Warehouse, an auction has just ended. Many 200-pound piles remain because cigarette company buyers would not offer more than the average $1.58 price per pound that the stabilization cooperative had set. So the cooperative bought it, and four migrant workers are loading it onto an 18-wheeler truck to take to the cooperative's storage depot.
Anna Belle Blalock, 78, the widow of a tobacco farmer, used to own a clothing store in town. "I remember I took in $1,700 in one day, about 20 years ago," she said. Now she owns a soda shop, which at noon one recent day had only one customer.
"I'd like to see the town grow," she said. "What it has done is shrunk up."

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: IN HAVANA;
Dollars Define Cuba's Haves And Have-Nots

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Aug. 27

 BODY:
When thousands of Cubans rioted against Government security forces here early this month, they shouted slogans against President Fidel Castro. They also hurled rocks at hotels where dollar-paying foreign tourists were staying and at stores that sell goods only for dollars.
"You work, and you earn 100 pesos a month, and you can't afford to live in this country," said Jose Bolano Rodriguez, whose stepdaughter was arrested in the riot that prompted Mr. Castro to let people escape freely in rafts. 
 Mr. Bolano's resentment points to a new phenomenon in this Communist-ruled island's long history of confrontation with the United States. More than 30 years after Mr. Castro's revolution, Cuba has once again become a country of two societies -- one with dollars and one without. And increasingly Cubans resent it.
Mr. Bolano, who lives a few steps from the coastline where people are making their escape, has no plans to leave Cuba. But like many of those who were clambering aboard homemade rafts this week, he complained that the Cuban Government under Mr. Castro had sacrificed its people in its zeal to earn more dollars to save its troubled economy. "It is we Cubans who have become the tourists here," he said.
He said even native goods like cigars and rum were far beyond the reach of most Cubans, who earn salaries in pesos, the official currency, not dollars. So too are certain nightclubs and resorts, because they are reserved for tourists.
In an effort to shore up its shrunken economy after the loss of Soviet subsidies, Cuba has in recent years tried to rebuild the tourist business in Havana and other areas. The aim is to create jobs and lure Europeans, Canadians and others here to spend hard currency: foreign tourists visiting Cuba can pay only in dollars, no matter what country they come from.
Mr. Castro has urged Cubans to be patient with scarcity so more dollars can be funneled to the hotel and beach resort industry. But resentment and anger are building.
 
Trade in Dollars Allowed
 To ease the tensions, the Government decided last year to let Cubans keep money in dollars and trade in dollars, although the peso is still considered the official currency. The Government runs "diplostores" in which goods ranging from cognac to canned ham to beach shorts are sold for dollars to Cubans and tourists alike.
The majority of people complain they cannot afford such goods. The only Cubans with regular access to dollars are those with contacts in the outside world -- people who have helpful relatives abroad or who work for the tourist industry or a certain branch of the Government.
A dollar trades on the streets from anywhere from 80 to 120 pesos, which for some people is nearly a month's wages.
"Out of necessity, many of our girls of 13, 14 and 15 are turning to prostitution so they can get dollars to buy clothes," said Marbel Betancourt Gonzalez, who sat beside a raft today waiting for the weather to clear. "If you don't have dollars, you can't live. But I will not subject myself to disease just for some tourist.
"It's not right that tourists can go into the diplostores and their children come out sucking on lollipops and chocolate and your child sees them and you know he can't have any. They cry. What do you tell them?"
Today, as storm clouds loomed and word came of rough waters in the Florida Straits, dozens of people were on the beaches putting the finishing touches on their rafts and organizing their belongings. At Cojimar, east of Havana, some people have thrown up shacks and lean-tos as they wait for the skies to clear.
Nearly everyone said they were leaving because they could no longer tolerate their harsh economic conditions.
Ms. Betancourt is taking only the clothes on her back, a compass, her high-school certificate and a photo of her 4-year-old-son, Jesus Lamas Betancourt, whom she is leaving behind with his father.
She cried when she showed a picture of him. "I can't help him here anymore," she said.
 
Hoping for Home in U.S.
 Like most of the refugees, Ms. Betancourt has every hope that she will be allowed to stay in the United States and will eventually be able to help her son, despite President Clinton's new policy of funneling the refugees to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station.
Mayra Ochendo Abreu, who sat with Ms. Betancourt on the beach in Cojimar, also said she had no choice but to leave. "I will risk my daughter's life rather than stay here where there is no food," she said. Beside her sat her slender 7-year-old daughter, Dallana, who wore a hat made of woven palm fronds for her voyage at sea.
Ms. Ochendo said she had sold all her belongings to pay for spaces on the raft for herself and her daughter. "I cry that I am doing this, but I have to," she said. "Here we will die of hunger."
Most of the people leaving in rafts appear to be young men who work at low-paying jobs. As two of the few women traveling, Ms. Ochendo and Ms. Betancourt have banded together for the tense wait.
Ms. Ochendo ticked off shortages of items ranging from milk -- daily milk rations go only to Cubans under the age of 7 and over 55 -- to flour to underwear to products like sanitary napkins.
To a large extent, the anguish of those making the treacherous journey has its seeds in the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Up to the late 1980's, the Soviet Union provided 70 percent of the imports of Cuba and bought nearly that much of its exports. Most important, it furnished millions of gallons of oil and thousands of tons of wheat to the island each year.
Cuba has tried to cut down on oil use. Electric power is routinely suspended for several hours a day because of a shortage of oil to run the power plants, and public buses run far less often than they used to. Responding to complaints that people could not get to their jobs, the Government bought Chinese-made bicycles, which it sells to workers for about 130 pesos -- for some people, a monthly wage.
Factories have shut down, leaving many people unemployed. Others have been sent to work in the fields, a job many would prefer not to have.
Everyone complains about the inconvenience of life without electricity.
"You buy milk for your baby and it goes bad because there is no electricity," Ms. Betancourt said.
A professor at a teachers' school who would give his name only as Roberto said it seemed to him that relatively few Cubans had left on rafts considering that Havana had a population of about two million.
 
Easier to Leave Than Revolt
 "All of Cuba is calm," he said as he stood with his bicycle on the beach in Cojimar. Nodding at the people building rafts, he added: "People here don't know very much about the rest of the world. They think we have the biggest problems."
Roberto said he agreed with many of those leaving that the economy was the worst it has been since Mr. Castro came to power. It is easier to find ways to leave than organize another revolution, he added.
"There is no tradition of protest here any more," he said, adding that the riot on Aug. 5 in downtown Havana was apparently spontaneous.
"There are those of us who want to stay, who believe that there is still something to fight for here," he said.
He pointed out that medical care was still better for Cubans than it was before the revolution, even though medical supplies have dwindled recently. All children are vaccinated, he noted, and school will begin on Sept. 1 as scheduled.
He also said he did not believe that Cuba was as much of a threat to the United States as President Clinton's hard-line policy against Mr. Castro would suggest. "Mr. Clinton should be discussing this with his foreign advisers, not with Jorge Mas Canosa," he said, referring to the right-wing Cuban-American leader in Miami.
While Cuba allows some emigration to the United States, many people say the process is agonizingly slow and too expensive for most Cubans. Leaving by water, while fraught with danger, is still the fastest way out.
Throughout the summer, Cubans hijacked several Government-owned ferries and tugboats so they could make their way across the Florida Straits. In July, 32 Cubans died when the tugboat they seized was rammed and sunk by a pursuing Cuban patrol boat.
On Aug. 4, a police officer was killed when a ferry was hijacked in Havana Bay. As the authorities retrieved the ferry and were returning it to port, a crowd of thousands on the Malecon, the capital's oceanfront boulevard, began chanting angry slogans.
When the police began clubbing people, the crowd threw rocks at hotels and tourist shops, including a dollar store near the Hotel Deauville.
Hundreds were arrested. Soon the angry crowds were replaced by others cheering Mr. Castro as he made his way down El Prado boulevard. Some Cubans doubt that show of support was spontaneous.
 
Castro Clears the Way
 Mr. Castro declared after the demonstrations that if Cubans wanted to leave so badly that they were hijacking boats, he would let them go. No longer would his coast guard patrol the waters off Cuba for people trying to leave illegally.
Mr. Bolano's stepdaughter, Tuliva Miranda, who is 20, was arrested that day. She told her stepfather that, like many of the others, she happened to be strolling by and that she had nothing to do with the riot.
Mr. Bolano still cannot get an answer from the authorities on what his stepdaughter is being charged with and when she will be tried.
"She is not political," he said, sitting outside his simple house of whitewashed brick. "She just likes to have fun."

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Will No. 1 Priority for Democrats Become No. 1 Liability?

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
In a memorandum to Democratic candidates earlier this summer, Representative Vic Fazio, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, could not have been clearer: "Health care will be the key to the '94 elections."
But now that the White House and Congressional leaders have essentially abandoned their push for universal health insurance before November, Democrats are confronted with a far more delicate challenge: preventing health care from becoming the key to their defeat. 
 From President Clinton on down, leading Democrats had looked to health care to save their party from widespread losses in the November elections. Even when the White House was in the thick of Whitewater and no one seemed to give Mr. Clinton credit for an improved economy or anything else, Democrats implored the naysayers to just wait. When Democratic incumbents delivered on their party's promise of health coverage for all, they said, they would be rewarded on Election Day.
 
A Big Enough Issue?
 Instead, the Democrats, already jittery about November, find themselves with three options, none particularly appealing: passing a modest package of changes before November, and billing them as progress, the first step to universal coverage. Or pointing the finger at uncooperative Republicans for blocking a bill (although moderate Democrats may be as much to blame.) Or changing subjects altogether to campaign on successes like the crime bill.
But while crime is a sure-fire election-year issue, it may not be one that gives Democrats a big edge over Republicans; no candidate supports lawlessness.
Administration officials say they will try to portray whatever Congress may pass this year on health as the first step to an overhaul effort that can continue next year -- not as a capitulation on Mr. Clinton's vow for universal coverage. But that might be a hard sell because the White House has devoted the past year to trying to persuade the public that health care was the most critical issue, and that universal coverage had to be the centerpiece.
 
Unfulfilled Pledges
 "They really blew it," said Martin Wattenberg, a political science professor at the University of California at Irvine. "People will see this as, 'We gave control to the Democrats and they still couldn't do anything.' Voters don't have a very long memory. What they remember is a party that pledged itself to this as the top priority, but when push came to shove, they didn't do anything."
Pledges like this one by Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, may come back to haunt the Democrats. "This is about universal coverage," Dr. Shalala said in an interview earlier this summer. "Universal coverage has got to be part of it."
While some in the party see an opportunity to attack Republicans in the stalemate that dragged down big health bills, others think it is better to move on.
"While failing to do a comprehensive health care bill can never help you," said former Representative Tom Downey of New York, a Democrat with close ties to the White House, "wringing your hands can hurt you more. What the Democrats have got to do is change the subject and talk about other things on the agenda, like GATT, Superfund and telecommunications."
 
How Much Do Voters Care?
 It may be too late. Mr. Clinton has dwelt on health overhaul since taking office, pushing it to the top of the national agenda, and there is no evidence that the issues like telecommunications even register with many voters. A New York Times/CBS News Poll in late July found that 8 in 10 Americans said it was "very important" that every citizen receive health insurance coverage.
While many Democrats acknowledge that the latest turn in the health care debate is bad news for them, it may not be devastating. Despite the polls that showed wide public support for a health care overhaul, lobbying efforts by opponents have also left many Americans frightened that their current coverage would be reduced, or, at the very least, confused by the assortment of proposals and counterproposals. The issue has been so unsettled that it has not moved front and center in campaigns; there were virtually no television campaign commercials on health care because candidates were waiting to see what happened.
And if a comprehensive bill may have been doomed because the issue never took off, for the same reason, voters may not care enough to punish incumbents for not producing one.
"The public support for major reform is less than it was at the beginning of this debate," said Senator Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat who is running for re-election this year. "To a large extent that is because campaigns to raise people's concerns and to increase doubts were very successful."
Some Democrats may even be relieved that even as Congress tries to patch together some sort of bill, they no longer have to cast what might have been a politically perilous vote on a major package.
Lawrence R. Jacobs, a professor who specializes in health and politics at the University of Minnesota, said the failure to tackle comprehensive reform did not have to be fatal if incumbents, Democrats or Republican, could justify their own positions.
 
Need 'Coherent Explanation'
 "Though it seems reasonable to expect that Democrats will get hurt on this, I don't think the fact that the house of health is crumbling will lead to a major fallout in terms of Congressional races," Mr. Jacobs said. "Members need to be able to go home and provide a coherent explanation for their position. They will try to put the best face on a bad situation by portraying the Republicans as opposed to change, locked in old ways."
He said Mr. Clinton could point to the health care quagmire as a reason to elect more Democrats in November. "He has every reason to frame this as a referendum issue: 'Give me a Congress I can work with,' " Mr. Jacobs said.
Though the Democrats are searching for other issues to run on, Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, said his party had put itself at much at risk as the Democrats by not moving on health care overhaul. "It will play against incumbents because it will suggest that Congress just doesn't function anymore," he said. "The challenge for both parties is twofold: successfully blaming the other. The Republicans have to communicate what they prevented, that sometimes it's better to do nothing than do something harmful."
Some Democrats hold the view that people beyond the capital will not be disappointed because they never expected Congress to pass a sweeping bill in the first place.
"Maybe I'm the naive optimist out here in the other Washington," said Charles Rolland, chairman of the Washington Democratic Party. "But if we have to take a smaller step than originally intended for the first step, the voters will understand."

HEADLINE: In Gambia, New Coup Follows Old Pattern

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BANJUL, Gambia, Aug. 26

 BODY:
When Lieut. Yahya Jammeh seized power in this West African country in a bloodless coup last month, breaking one of the continent's longest traditions of electoral democracy, he joined the increasingly crowded ranks of soldiers who have risen to power in Africa.
From the start, Lieutenant Jammeh, 29 years old, fresh from a military-police training course in the United States, has promised that his would be a "coup with a difference." He has vowed that he and his fellow soldiers are "not here to perpetuate ourselves," and will return to the barracks "as soon as we have set things right." 
 Such pledges say much about this region's recent history. Young military officers have time and again overthrown larcenous or ineffectual civilian leaders in the name of national redemption, only to cling to power through violence while inflicting even greater disaster on their countries' economies.
 
Donors Are Skeptical
 So if ordinary people in a mostly illiterate population of mainly peanut farmers and poor city dwellers have applauded the coup and its leader, many educated Gambians are bracing for the worst. Their skepticism is shared by Gambia's major donors, the European Union and the United States, which have suspended most of their aid and have pressed for a quick return to civilian rule in the tiny former British colony that stretches along the Gambia River.
"This is exactly the same phenomenon we have seen elsewhere, with the only difference being that so far there has been no violence," a Western diplomat said of the coup.
For his part, the young lieutenant now in charge here bristles at the comparisons with nearby countries like Liberia, where a sergeant named Samuel K. Doe seized power in 1980 promising equality and an end to corruption. Instead, the country plunged into a civil war that continues today.
But even as he pledges to announce a timetable for a transition to democracy by the end of September, Lieutenant Jammeh, a child of the rural upcountry whose formal education ended in the 10th grade, complains that suspensions of vital donor aid in the meantime amount to "neocolonialism."
"We are here for reasons that are peculiar only to Gambia, and what has happened in other parts of the continent, that does not concern us," Lieutenant Jammeh said in an interview in a crimson-carpeted salon of State House.
 
Political Activity Banned
 Other Gambians, and several longtime political analysts here say that despite these protestations, the similarities linking the Gambia's new rulers to other military regimes in the region are disturbingly clear.
Governing by decree with four other junior officers and several civilians at his side, Lieutenant Jammeh has barred all political activity, arrested two socialist journalists who defied him, and detained many of his superiors in the 800-man armed forces, while confining ministers of the former Government to house arrest.
"Our fears and apprehensions are pretty much the same, because military governments are generally the same," said Kenneth Y. Best, the managing director of The Daily Observer, a Liberian citizen who was forced to flee the Doe regime's terror in 1990.
 
Promises to Fight Corruption
 Much like the early President Doe, Lieutenant Jammeh has said that his goal is to wipe out corruption and help improve living standards in a country where the illiteracy rate is 70 percent and per capita income is $300 a year.
The example the new leader uses most often to illustrate his country's backwardness is what he calls the failure of predecessor -- Sir Dawda K. Jawara -- to build a single hospital in 30 years.
A more telling case, some Gambians say, and one that may negatively affect the country's course for generations, is the deposed President's failure to build a university, or even, as some here tell it, a single new high school.
"We had elections every five years; I guess that was the legacy," said one former Government Minister who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It seems pretty clear now that we could have done a lot better. All we can do now is pray that these young fellows will know what to do."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Perhaps the Biggest Problem Is That the Owners Don't Trust One Another

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
During the 50-day strike in 1981, Raymond Grebey, the owners' chief negotiator, adopted a mantra to try to show how foolish the owners believed the players were in not accepting their proposal. "We now have a strike over the rights of 11 players," Grebey would say, reducing the number every few days.
Thirteen years later, baseball may have a strike because the owners don't trust one another. 
 "When you begin to examine what they're saying," Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, said yesterday, "it becomes obvious the positions they take don't have much to do with the underlying causes of the problems they say they want to solve. There is a strike because they can't solve their internal disputes to their satisfaction. We could go into next year with a strike over matters that have nothing to do with us."
 
Union's Position Buttressed
 On the 17th day of the eighth work stoppage in 23 seasons, it perhaps is not a startling revelation that owners don't trust one another. Still, an unequivocal expression of that mistrust -- and, by extension, its impact on these negotiations -- was laid out the other day by John Harrington, owner of the Boston Red Sox, in response to a question.
Harrington didn't talk about trust directly, and perhaps he didn't mean to leave that impression, but he buttressed the union's long-held contention that this dispute is between the owners and not between the owners and the players.
Last Thursday, after the second day of meetings between groups of owners and players, Harrington was asked at a news conference why the owners linked the salary cap they want the players to accept to the clubs' revenue-sharing plan. Under that plan, adopted last January but made contingent on the players' acceptance of a cap, richer clubs would give portions of their local revenue to poorer clubs.
"If large and middle-market clubs are going to move money to the small-market clubs," Harrington replied, "we want to insure that that money is spent on player salaries so that the competitive level of those teams that are receiving that money is improved."
 
Take the Money and Run
 Acknowledgement of mistrust No. 1:
The richer clubs are afraid that the poorer clubs would take the money and run -- to the bank, that is, clinging to their new-found wealth instead of spending it on players. If the wealthier clubs are going to give up some of their money, they want to make sure the San Diego-type teams in their midst use it to improve themselves.
That aim makes sense and justifies the part of the owners' proposal that calls for a salary floor, or minimum payroll, requiring a team to spend no less than 84 percent of the average club payroll. But, Harrington was asked, why not implement a salary floor without a salary cap?
"If large-market clubs," he replied, "are going to be taking money out of their coffers, their hard-earned money from ticket prices and media, and moving it to smaller-market clubs, we want to be sure all of the larger-market clubs will be playing on a level field also.
"There has to be some cap to make sure that when Boston weakens itself by moving $5 or $6 million out of its revenue stream, we don't have some other large-market club investing substantial amounts of non-revenue money in order to buy a pennant. We want a level playing field all the way around, large markets and small markets, so you have to cap the large-market clubs to be sure that they will maintain a competitive level that's fair."
 
Using Personal Fortunes
 Acknowledgement of mistrust No. 2:
The richer clubs are afraid that some of their kind might spend part of their owners' personal fortune to lure top players and thus gain an unfair competitive advantage. Ewing Kauffman, the late owner of the Kansas City Royals, was noted for that kind of expenditure, and other owners didn't like it.
In order to prevent such underhanded, overspending practices, the clubs want the players to accept a cap on their salaries. This is just the latest example of what Marvin Miller, the players' legendary labor leader, always said about the owners: They want the players to protect the owners from themselves.
"It seems silly to us as players," Scott Sanderson, a veteran pitcher with the Chicago White Sox, said yesterday, "to be asked to control the spending on the owners' side when admittedly they have trouble controlling themselves. We're not going to do anything to curb the owners' spending."
Richard Ravitch, head of the owners' negotiating team, disagreed with the interpretation of Harrington's comments that says the clubs don't trust one another. But he added, "I won't comment on John's comments. He has a thorough understanding of this. Throughout the revenue-sharing debate, John and I engaged in a lengthy discourse."
 
A Level Playing Field
 Bud Selig also didn't see the matter of trust among clubs as an issue.
"If you're going to reroute money, you want to make sure the playing field is level at all levels," the acting commissioner said. "If I'm a big-market club, you need a cap because it's one thing to change the economic rules, but you're changing them to try to make the playing field level at all levels. That's why you need a minimum and a cap."
Furthermore, Selig said, the owners are not asking the players to pay for the new system. "We're asking players to share in the burden," he said. "Everybody has to make adjustments. But the amount of the guarantee, $1 billion for player compensation, takes that burden away. If you're forming a new relationship, obviously all parties have to feel they're being treated fairly. That's why we started with $1 billion. We're certainly not asking for givebacks."
That's not the way the players see it, but then, they don't trust the owners either.

HEADLINE: Prisons, Privatization and Profits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The privatizing of America's prisons seems altogether appropriate to the trend of our economic activity. The next stage would be to link the solution to crime and the North American Free Trade Agreement to achieve a lower cost basis by transferring the plant facilities to Mexico, where prisons could be built and maintained for less than half the expense. There might be a slight resulting increase to our unemployment figures, which could create a climate for slightly more crime, but this would be more than offset by the savings. 
 The next logical step would be to solve our health care crisis through Nafta by developing medical facilities and staff in Mexico, where we could then ship all of our ill.
Your article very insightfully points out that one of the major corrections privateers is backed by a group that also backs our nation's largest for-profit operator of hospitals. When the giant sucking sound gets loud enough, the American people may wake up.

HEADLINE: Prisons, Privatization and Profits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your recent article on prison privatization produced warm feelings about what's going on in our nation's few private prisons -- profits are up, costs are down, prisoners are learning how to sew and guards and prisoners are downright chummy. A pretty picture but far from reality. 
 The 60,000 members of AFSCME Corrections United, the men and women who work in government-run prisons, know a different reality. They know that prison is an ugly place, housing people who have committed an array of crimes -- many of them horrible -- against individuals and against society. These corrections officers have only one goal when they go to work: to protect the outside world from these prisoners. They always have an eye on our security, never on their profit sharing.
Yet the salaries and benefits of these corrections officers are eyed by private corporations as a way to expand their profit margins. Common sense tells us that these reductions in salary and benefit levels will severely hinder the recruitment of qualified professionals into the occupation.
For a multitude of economic, ethical, legal, social and practical reasons, state and local governments simply cannot afford to abdicate incarceration responsibilities to private entities. The consequences are too great to risk delegating such an awesome responsibility to a private, profit-motivated corporation; desperate prisoners and cost-cutting prisons are a flammable combination.
Our bottom line is the safety and protection of the people who live beyond the prison walls from those whom the law has declared unfit to walk among us.

HEADLINE: What's in a Symbol? A Lot, the M.T.A. Is Betting

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Would New York City's transit system by any other name still be the same confusing tangle of rail and bus lines in the eyes of the riders? The Metropolitan Transportation Authority thinks not, and it is spending $3 million to prove it.
Over the next four years, the authority plans to replace the myriad names and logos used by its five subsidiaries with a uniform M.T.A. logo and somewhat simpler names, though not necessarily shorter ones. The Metro-North Commuter Railroad, for instance, becomes the M.T.A. Metro-North Railroad, while the Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority becomes M.T.A. Long Island Bus. 
 The idea, transit officials say, is to make it clear that every public bus, subway car and train in New York really belongs to the authority. If this sounds like a bureaucratic version of an identity crisis, it is. In essence, the M.T.A. feels misunderstood.
 
Questions of Cost
 "If you look at all of our vehicles there is no way of telling these vehicles are responsible to the same authority," said Alicia Martinez, the authority's marketing director. "How do we identify ourselves to customers so they know who is responsible for the system?"
Peter E. Stangl, the M.T.A. chairman, has said the new logo and simple names are part of a larger effort to weld the authority's rail and bus services, linking them with an electronic fare-collection system that someday will allow riders to transfer easily from one part of the system to another. He said that for a multi-billion-dollar agency, the cost was a modest price to clarify its services to riders.
"I want to convey that we are a regional transportation system, that each of the agencies are a part of a bigger system," Mr. Stangl said. "Frankly, it's about time we did something to stop confusing our customers."
Although transit officials say they are making the conversion in an economical manner -- using up their back supply of stationery, for example, and changing logos as buses and train cars are brought in for regular maintenance -- some advocates for riders question whether such a cosmetic change is worth the expense.
The transportation agency has already paid private consultants $450,000 to study the names in use and to design the new look. Transit officials plan to spend about $2.5 million to convert thousands of signs on buses, train cars and stations.
"This strikes us as largely nonsense that will have little to do with the quality of service," said Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group for riders. "I think it's a very hard sell for the authority to make people believe that this is somehow going to improve transit."
 
Initials in a Hurry
 In April, the authority began replacing the old two-toned "M" logo with a sporty blue circle depicting the M.T.A. initials written in perspective as if they were rushing by, like a train. The logo was intended to create "a more modern look, with a sense of openness and movement -- qualities the M.T.A. wants to convey to customers," an internal report said.
Among the changes being made, the venerable Transit Authority, the subsidiary that runs the subways and most of the city's buses, becomes M.T.A. New York City Transit. The word "authority" was judged by transit officials as too dictatorial.
"One of the aims of the program was to humanize the names a little bit," said Bernard Cohen, director of policy and planning for the M.T.A. "Removing the word 'authority' was seen as a way to make the services a little more friendly."
Mr. Cohen said the M.T.A. wanted to use the same terms ordinary people use. Thus the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority will henceforth be called M.T.A. Bridges and Tunnels.
Some of the changes do not simplify things at all. The Long Island Rail Road, a name that has been around since the railroad was founded 160 years ago, will now be the M.T.A. Long Island Rail Road. The Metro-North Commuter Railroad will gain the omnipresent M.T.A. prefix and lose the word commuter, on the theory that it is now taking more city dwellers on weekend jaunts to the country and is thus no longer just a commuter line, officials said.
 
Seven Kinds of 'M'
 The Transit Authority will now use three separate names. "M.T.A. New York City Transit" will be painted on token booths and at station entrances. The city buses will lose the old oversized M with "Surface" written underneath in favor of "M.T.A. New York City Bus"; subway trains will be marked "M.T.A. New York City Subway."
Although many people understand the M.T.A. has something to do with the city's subways and buses, surveys have shown that a majority do not know the M.T.A. owns the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North, transit officials said.
To make matters worse, officials complain that the various railroads and bus companies in the system have over the years developed a baffling array of "M" symbols, names, acronyms, pictograms, colors and type styles. The most extreme example is the multicolored, backward-slanting M.S.B.A. symbol on Long Island buses that (shudder!) does not mention the M.T.A. anywhere.
At last count, there are at least 7 different versions of the "M" logo in use and nearly 20 different names, officials say. Sometimes the logo appears as a two-toned M inside a circle, sometimes alone. Sometimes it appears with enigmatic captions like "Long Island," "Suburban" or "Surface."
After a four-year study by a consultant who specializes in corporate identities, transit officials determined last October that the variety of names and logos were "confusing, unfriendly and suggest a sense of disorder," Ms. Martinez said.

 
A Four-Year Conversion
 So far the new logo has appeared only in advertisements and internal documents and on the stationery at the M.T.A. headquarters. But transit workers have installed one new sign at a token booth on Canal Street and a sign above the newly renovated entrance of Penn Station features the fresh logo.
Because the old names are established by state law, they will continue to be used on legal documents, contracts and bonds, transit officials said, but they have not ruled out the possibility of asking the Legislature to adopt the new names officially.
It will take four years to paint the new logos on the authority's 3,980 buses and 15,000 train cars, not to mention signs at 723 stations, and 742 token booths, officials say. Newly purchased equipment will also have the new emblems.
But what about the old two-toned M, which has been around since 1966?
"We felt that the M didn't mean a lot to people," said Mr. Cohen. "People never talk about taking the M, but they do talk about the M.T.A."
 
Not Like the BART
 But Mr. Russianoff, of the Straphangers Campaign, said New Yorkers were not likely to begin using the M.T.A. initials in casual conversation, no matter how much the authority promotes the notion. He pointed out that most people still call the subway system "the subway" and that some riders stubbornly cling to the antiquated designations for subway lines derived from the names of rail companies that have been defunct for a half-century: IND, IRT and BMT.
"If they spend $2.5 million, four years from now, no one will be calling the subways the 'M.T.A. Subway'," Mr. Russianoff said. "No one is going to use the words 'M.T.A.' It's just not the winning set of initials."
Beverly Dolinsky, the executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A., said the real intent of the program appeared to be promoting the notion of a single transit system tied together by electronic fare cards. It remains to be seem whether putting the M.T.A. logo in front of every name will accomplish that, she said.
"I worry because there are so many competing needs and by itself it seems like an awful lot of money for something that doesn't seem really essential," Ms. Dolinsky said.

HEADLINE: Fed Official Disapproves Of Rate Policy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Wyo., Aug. 27

 BODY:
Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, publicly broke ranks with most of his colleagues today, saying he believed that the nation's central bank should seek to hold down unemployment in setting interest rates.
Speaking at the Federal Reserve's annual conference here, Mr. Blinder said that while controlling inflation was important, the Federal Reserve could limit unemployment for a few years at a time through low interest rates. He strongly criticized the idea, widely held among his colleagues and many economists, that a central bank would be more effective in fighting inflation if it focused solely on maintaining stable prices.
Mr. Blinder's comments revealed an intellectual split within the Federal Reserve, but seemed unlikely to produce a split over policy for the time being. Mr. Blinder said he thought unemployment in the United States, which stood at 6.1 percent in July, was now roughly as low as it could go without feeding inflation.
The clear implication of his comment, though not explicitly stated, was that the Federal Reserve could continue to raise short-term interest rates to fight any threat of inflation as long as unemployment stayed low.
 
First Clinton Appointee
 But Mr. Blinder's comments did suggest that if unemployment and inflation rose simultaneously again, as occurred in the 1970's, he would be much more reluctant than his colleagues to raise interest rates further.
Mr. Blinder is President Clinton's first appointee to the central bank, and his comments today were especially significant because he is a leading candidate to head the central bank when Mr. Greenspan's term expires early in 1996. President Reagan first appointed Mr. Greenspan in 1987, and President Bush appointed him to a second term in 1992.
In contrast to Mr. Blinder's statements today, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has tried for years in testimony before Congress to distance the central bank from responsibility for unemployment. Mr. Greenspan told a House panel on Aug. 10 that maintaining stable prices was the primary goal of the Federal Reserve.
He reminded Representatives that he had previously testified in favor of a bill that would require the Federal Reserve to pursue zero inflation above all other goals, including the reduction of unemployment.
He has said he does not believe sustained reductions in unemployment can be achieved by permitting low interest rates and rising inflation.
 
Long-Term Approach
 While Mr. Greenspan has never publicly defined the duration of a sustained reduction, none of his comments have suggested that the Federal Reserve might be able to hold down unemployment for a few years, as Mr. Blinder suggested today. Mr. Greenspan said on Aug. 10 that any unemployment gain was "ephemeral" and "very quickly dissipates."
Mr. Blinder did say he did not believe that interest rates could be used to hold down unemployment over the long term -- which he defined as 5 to 10 years.
He said he believed the economy was now roughly at the maximum level of employment possible without feeding inflation. He had testified at his Senate confirmation hearing last spring that he supported the Federal Reserve's first three interest-rate increases.
He is widely rumored to have supported the Fed's decision to raise short-term interest rates by another half a percentage point on Aug. 16, although Fed officials have refused to confirm or deny this. Mr. Blinder has never publicly expressed a view on the Fed's fourth interest-rate increase, which took place in May, after his confirmation hearing but before he joined the Fed.
Mr. Greenspan made an oblique reference here on Friday to his distaste for using low interest rates and higher inflation to hold down unemployment, a tactic known in economic policy circles as using monetary policy to seek macroeconomic gain.
"Any tendency to seek a bit of macro policy relief by pushing on the outer limits of monetary policy risks longer-term financial instability," Mr. Greenspan said.
 
Endorsing a Fed Goal
 Congressional Democrats amended the Federal Reserve Act in 1978 to require the central bank to seek full employment as well as price stability. It is this amendment that the bill supported by Mr. Greenspan would change.
But in an interview after his speech today, Mr. Blinder endorsed the full-employment goal. "A central bank should have an employment objective," he said. "The evidence is overwhelming."
Janet Yellen, who is President Clinton's other appointee to the Federal Reserve Board this year, also endorsed the use of monetary policy to hold down unemployment at her confirmation hearing in July. But she was not as emphatic as Mr. Blinder was today, nor did she actually criticize the idea that central banks can control inflation better if they do not look at unemployment.

HEADLINE: The Cairo Conference

 BODY:
A week from now thousands of people from all over the world will gather in Cairo for the once-in-a decade International Conference on Population and Development. Like the conferences in 1974 and 1984, this one will deal with a population explosion that despite the extraordinary worldwide acceptance of family-planning programs still threatens to impoverish the planet.
In the earlier meetings, women were on the edge of the discussion. Now they are at center stage because, as Timothy Wirth, Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, put it, "We must recognize that women know . . . what they need, and they must be equal partners in programs and policies." 
 Ideally, the final document will provide a framework for population policies that will include the empowerment of women. Those policies would not only give women and their partners the ability to limit the size of their families, but would also help women gain better health services, better educations and, above all, equality with men. How that document is used will depend on governments, their citizens and laws -- which is why its language must be, and is, fluid enough to reflect the diversity of the 170 countries that contributed to the initial draft.
Such a document will not emerge, however, if the Vatican, which successfully deleted broad terms like "reproductive rights," "family planning" and "safe motherhood" from the draft, now turns the conference into a colloquy on abortion, homosexuality and extramarital sex. To that end, it has looked for help toward Islam, specifically fundamentalist groups and governments in countries like Iran and Libya.
Last week Vice President Al Gore called the Vatican-fueled diversion "a red herring." The U.S., he said, "has not sought, does not seek and will not seek to establish any international right to an abortion." Neither does the draft document. Instead, in the section on health, morbidity and mortality, it calls attention to the public health consequences of botched abortions; and while it asks that women should be able to terminate their pregnancies safely should they choose, it adds this proviso: "in those cases where it is allowed by law."
Mr. Gore also pointed out, correctly, that the best way to make abortion -- legal or otherwise -- rare is to make contraceptives widely and readily available. The draft document, however, does not seek to establish a basic human right to their availability. Rather, it asks governments to assess the extent of unmet needs for family planning services.
The whole point of this Cairo exercise is for all countries to agree on certain basic principles and policies that would enable the future of this world to be a decent one. Ideally, they will recognize that family planning and economic growth, though possible separately, are best accomplished hand in hand. The conference is a chance to establish globally the idea that the empowerment of women involves their ability not only to control fertility but also to get an education and a job, to engage fathers in child rearing, and to be spared such human rights abuses as forced abortion and genital mutilation.
If narrowly nationalistic or sectarian interests block discussion and movement toward those goals, the conference will be a lost opportunity.

HEADLINE: The rage for the real

BYLINE: By Joan Duncan Oliver 

 BODY:
Save for the occasional flurry -- Elsa Peretti's "Diamonds-By-The-Yard" at Tiffany's in the 1970's; Paloma Picasso's killer rocks at the same store in the early 80's; the sale of the Duchess of Windsor's fabled jewels at Sotheby's in 1987 -- real jewelry as fashion news has been all but moribund for decades.
But last March, the influential English designer John Galliano, who shows in Paris, chose to accessorize his fall collection with important pieces borrowed from such venerable French jewelers as Rene Boivin. When Galliano repeated the performance in New York in June at Bergdorf Goodman, with diamonds from Van Cleef & Arpels, fashion antennae started whirring. Editors who had felt ho-hum about the real stuff started giving it more than perfunctory attention. After several seasons of severe, accessory-less style, somehow the real stuff began to look right. 
 "Real jewelry is a sign of the new glamour," was Galliano's explanation. "There's a resurgence of elegance. Women have lost interest in hiding behind shapeless clothes and again want to celebrate beauty and femininity."
Darting among the models backstage at Bergdorf's, a puckish figure in red leather pants and a tail coat, Galliano tweaked and tucked and managed to make the pedigreed jewelry look almost cheeky. He slipped a 12.5-carat diamond earring into the bodice of a pink satin fishtail dress, turned a $200,000 diamond bow into a hatpin, jabbed a $28,000 camellia brooch onto a Persian lamb muff. "Diamonds should be worn irreverently," he says, "such as on the ankles, or back to front. Or like a pair of jeans."
Then there was Marc Jacobs, the street-smart New York designer, whose show was the talk of the fall collections. He accessorized his clothes with diamond earrings and scatter pins he had designed himself. With his little paveed letters and numbers, you can flash your name and phone number across your chest, if that's your thing. "I like diamonds worn with a throwaway attitude," Jacobs says.
Meanwhile, the House of Chanel, legendary for its high-fashion costume jewelry, has come out with its first precious jewelry since the 1930's. Introduced last year in Paris, it is due here in October.
And Tiffany's is planning to launch a small but important gem missile of its own (see " 'Juicy' Jewels," page 52).
W hat's happening now is a shift in attitude. There's a new kick to getting dressed: it's playing dress-up. Like the little tweed suits, slinky evening dresses and Mata Hari makeup around this season, fine jewelry taps into past images of glamour. After a couple of sober years, fashion's back to the pursuit of pleasure. Diamond sales last year topped $12 billion, an all-time high. What better than real flash to celebrate the sheer fun of being decorative? The mid-90's sense of values isn't how big or how much or how old, but how delicious and how good.
 Questions of value loom larger in periods of economic uncertainty. In 1932, at the height of the Depression, Coco Chanel, already established as queen of the faux, stunned Paris by mounting an exhibit of platinum and diamond pieces (they weren't for sale), ostensibly to benefit the foundering jewelry industry. "At a time of financial crisis," she said to explain the gesture, "in every aspect of life there appears an instinctive craving for authenticity."
The idea is right on target now. When costume jewelry may cost thousands, yet ruby rings are hawked on QVC, there's an undeniable pull toward value. "If you're going to spend $1,500 anyway," says Jean Appleton, the founder and director of the Jewelry Resource Center at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, "then you think, 'I might as well buy something real.' "
And something else is happening. The "trophy wife," on whom a man could hang material evidence of his success, is phasing out. Working women are buying jewelry for themselves. "Even women married to men who want to do the giving have gotten the message across that they want to be involved in the choice," says Edward J. Landrigan, president of the New York jeweler Verdura.
For some women, of course, precious jewelry has never lost its luster. Witness the success of Verdura, which is reissuing the jewelry of Fulco di Verdura and Suzanne Belperron, two influential designers from the first half of the century whose work had slipped into obscurity.
Just as fake furs are stirring up a fur revival, costume jewelry, with its crash and splash, is credited by many experts with helping to bring back the real. "The most effective costume jewelry has its genesis in real jewelry, much of it from the 30's and 40's," says Landrigan. "It was bold, and there was a lot of exciting jewelry then."
When Landrigan took over the company in 1984, Fulco di Verdura's work was known to the general public mainly through Kenneth Jay Lane's costume jewelry knockoffs. Landrigan dusted off the Verdura archives, containing thousands of designs.
A charming and soigne Sicilian duke, whose family was chronicled in "The Leopard" by Giuseppe di Lampedusa, Verdura was as much a part of cafe society as most of his clients. He got his start from Chanel in the 20's, creating her signature enameled Maltese-cross cuffs. Like Chanel, Verdura preferred gold and colored gems to platinum and diamonds, and thought big "important" stones on their own were vulgar. (He reportedly referred to diamond solitaires as "swimming pools.") From the time he set up shop in New York in 1939, fashionable women found his mad artistry an antidote to the Art Deco jewelry then in vogue -- and far more suitable for daytime wear. There were real seashells dipped in precious and semiprecious stones; gold looped and twisted into ropes and swags and sailor's knots; fantastical animal and flower brooches. "Verdura broke all the rules," says Landrigan. "He made jewelry out of sea glass: the blue was milk of magnesia bottles; the green, 7-Up. He used big, chunky beads in pinks and blues, mabe pearls and Russian emerald beads. They weren't gem-quality, Colombian emeralds, so they didn't cost hundreds of thousands of dollars."
In 1991, Landrigan acquired the sketchbooks of the Parisian designer Suzanne Belperron, along with exclusive rights to sell the jewelry made from her designs. Belperron, who was born in 1900, two years after Verdura, worked steadily from the 1920's until her death in 1983. But she was so reclusive that it was only with the auction of the Duchess of Windsor's jewelry that Belperron's name and work came to light.
She gave no interviews and refused to sign her pieces. (They are recognized today by the maker's mark, Darde et Fils; the new pieces are stamped with her name, to distinguish them.) Known to a stylish "underground," she is sometimes called the "JAR" of her day. (JAR is Joel Arthur Rosenthal, another famously inventive Parisian jeweler, American by birth, who works out of his tiny shop, JAR's, off the Place Vendome. He, like Belperron, sees clients only by appointment and by referral.)
Belperron's talent ripened early. Just 23 when she went to work for Rene Boivin, she was instrumental in establishing the look of his jewelry house, before leaving a decade later to form a partnership with the pearl dealer Bernard Herz. Her life is veiled in mystery -- she burned her papers before she died -- but there are stories: that she was Herz's lover for many years; that she was in the French Resistance during World War II. In any case, when Herz was sent to a concentration camp, Belperron put the firm in her name and carried on. After the war -- Herz died in the camp -- she took his son, Jean, who had been a prisoner of war, into the business as her partner.
Her clientele stretched from Colette to the avant-garde designer Elsa Schiaparelli to Grace Kelly, and to such celebrated men as Charlie Chaplin, Gary Cooper, Fred Astaire and Frank Sinatra. Except for Colette (Belperron reportedly broke her usual policy to make "house calls" to the aged writer), they all trooped off to Belperron's small shop in the ninth arrondissement, on the rue de Chateaudun, for the jeweler's equivalent of couture fittings.
"I'm not surprised Schiaparelli was a client," says a woman who knew them both. "There would have been a meeting of the minds there. Neither one was a traditionalist." In 1935, Schiaparelli was photographed by Vogue wearing Belperron jewels with her Venetian blackamoor costume for Daisy Fellowes's Bal Oriental. "Incredible accessories" is how the magazine described them.
Unlike Verdura, Belperron never socialized with clients. "Nobody ever got on a first-name basis with her," a former customer recalls, though "she had a perfectly charming personality, a lovely smile." Black-haired, elegant, Belperron always wore black and, before it was fashionable, long fingernails painted dark red. Meeting with a client, she often sketched while talking. Then she'd say, "But let me refine this a little." Later, after the client had gone, she'd spread out gems on her worktable or on the floor to study their effect at a distance.
Each piece was one-of-a-kind. Belperron's sketchbooks -- some 4,500 drawings, more than 800 of them brooches -- don't even cover the extent of her output. The range of motifs is vast, from stylized natural elements -- a butterfly, a bunch of grapes, a fiddlehead fern, a conch shell -- to gutsy abstract forms drawn from her far-flung travels. "You can practically hear the tribal drums when you look at her work," Landrigan says.
Like Verdura, Belperron mixed precious stones and humbler materials. She was among the first to sink gems directly into rock crystal, quartz and chalcedony, devising nearly invisible settings that played up the colors and sensuous forms. The finished pieces -- a crystal and diamond starfish, for example, or a chalcedony flower with articulated petals -- are not quite like what anyone else was doing, or has done since. "People are finally understanding that jewelry can be a work of art," Landrigan says.
When a pair of Belperron's wavy scroll-motif platinum and diamond cuffs from the 30's came up for auction last April, "half the audience was waiting for those bracelets," says John Block, an executive vice president at Sotheby's and director of the jewelry and precious objects department in New York. They
sold for $222,500 -- nearly three times the high estimate of $80,000.
The sapphire, diamond and blue chalcedony pieces that Belperron made for the Duchess of Windsor look as modern today as 60 years ago. "It's a 90's sensibility," says Marion Fasel, a jewelry historian and co-author with Penny Proddow of "Hollywood Jewels" (Abrams) and of a forthcoming history of diamond jewelry styles. "When a woman isn't going to feel comfortable wearing a large emerald on the street, she's certainly going to feel comfortable wearing a large chalcedony, because it doesn't scream 'precious jewelry,' yet it has the sparkle of diamonds and sapphires, and it's well crafted."
With security such an issue now, jewelers are more tight-lipped than ever about their clients. Those in the know, however, are aware that women regularly mentioned in the society columns are wearing Belperron and Verdura. There are ways around the security problem. Those Hermes and Armani scarves draped around fashionable necks may be covering an important brooch. Brushing aside the scarf ever so slightly, the wearer can show her pin to those she knows will appreciate it fully. "It's a bit of theater, that scarf," says Landrigan. "But it works."
Meanwhile, at the old, established jewelry houses, the workrooms are as busy as ever. At Harry Winston one recent morning, the head designer, Ambaji Shinde, was checking progress on a rush order: a pair of drop earrings and a necklace designed around five colossal emeralds brought in by a client from the Middle East. "This is the only company where we can play," he said, in his quiet, courtly manner. "Nobody else has these stones."
For 32 years Shinde has been creating pieces with some of the world's most impressive gems. In his small upstairs office, out of sight of the customers, he paints detailed watercolor designs with the delicacy of an Indian court miniaturist. Having begun his career in Bombay after India's independence, when maharajahs were selling off their jewels by the drawerful, Shinde is used to turning major stones into works of art. When the company president, Ronald Winston, presented him with an exceedingly rare green diamond -- at 8.09 carats, the world's largest -- Shinde made several sketches. "One was a flower," he says. "But then I thought, 'Why not a peacock?' " The resulting brooch, reminiscent of a turban pin, has articulated vanes that wiggle and rows of sapphires, emeralds and colored diamonds surrounding the big green gem.
With a price tag of $3 million, such artistry eludes most jewelry wearers. But on a more modest scale, fine-jewelry sales are up across the country, notes Stephen Magner, vice president in charge of precious jewelry at Neiman Marcus. Not only are diamonds on the upswing, but estate jewelry, too, is selling well, especially Art Deco. "The old look is now a fashion statement," Magner says.
It also signals a sense of permanence, a yearning for substance. "People see enormous integrity in those pieces," says Ralph Destino, the chairman of Cartier. "Some of the allure -- the attractiveness, the provenance -- of old pieces has shaped ideas about what jewelry today should be. The attitude is: 'If I can't have yesterday's heirloom, I can buy tomorrow's.' "
But for all the lofty explanations for precious jewelry's resurgence -- the ups and downs of hemlines, taste or the economy -- fashion has its own goofy logic. The best justification for the real may be the simplest: "The reason I chose diamonds," says John Galliano, "is that they make me smile."
 
'JUICY' JEWELS
 
Tiffany's latest collection of "gems" takes its cue from some unlikely sources. "I think the whole look of America is changing," says the company's senior vice president and design director, John Loring. "Cartooning is the most important influence on a generation brought up on pop culture." For them, much of today's jewelry "is too linear and dry," he says. His solution? What he calls "juicy jewelry," with the curvy shapes and plump profiles that make cartoon characters so appealing. "Things have to be fun in this day and age," Loring says. All the pieces are in matte-finish 18-karat gold with pearl or colored-stone accents. Even more fun are the prices: $725 to $1,400. -- JOAN DUNCAN OLIVER

Nat West Announces Plans To Expand Into the Bronx
 Under pressure from a community action group that questioned its commitment to the inner cities, Nat West Bank announced last week that it would expand into the Bronx, opening several branches beginning next year. 
 The announcement came after the group, Inner City Press/Community on the Move, tried to block Nat West's purchase of two banks in New Jersey on the basis of the Community Reinvestment Act, which compels banks to lend in the communities they serve. The organization said Nat West had not done enough business in the Bronx.
The first Bronx bank will open by July 31, near 161st Street and the Grand Concourse, said Donald P. Schwartz, senior vice president of Nat West.
Nat West said it hopes to be part of a revitalization of the South Bronx. "We're getting in on the ground floor of an area where there will be a lot of opportunities," Mr. Schwartz said.
 
Owners of Merchants New York To Open Blues Club on Eighth Ave.
 The owners of Merchants New York, the cozy bar-restaurant across the street from Barneys downtown at Seventh Avenue and 17th Street, are opening a new blues club this week at 73 Eighth Avenue, between 13th and 14th Streets.
The owners, Andrew Emmet and Ibrahim Merchant, along with William Gilmore, who owns two blues clubs in Chicago, will open Chicago B.L.U.E.S. on the site of the former jazz club Zanzibar.
"We've painted the walls midnight blue, revamped the sound system and dirtied the place up a bit," Mr. Emmet said. "Other than that, there wasn't too much to be done."
The new club will have no food service, just "lots to drink," Mr. Emmet said. "Merchants is upscale, but this will be a little bit downscale since it is the blues."
The club will open Wednesday night with Big Time Sarah and the B. T. Express.
 
Course Offers Business Advice To Spanish-Speaking Women
 The American Woman's Economic Development Corporation will be offering a "Start Your Own Business" course in Spanish starting in the fall.
"Many Latino women are intimidated about being taken seriously in the business world," said Maria Salcedo, a counseling director at the nonprofit group and a founder of the new curriculum.
"They are not only going to get the training with us, but they will get the reassurance they need that a Latino woman can start her own business," she said.
The cost of the program is $125 and runs for 10 three-hour sessions at the organization's offices at 71 Vanderbilt Avenue, between 45th and 46th Streets. For information, call (212) 692-9100.

Amid the Houses, Bodegas Grow in Queens

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
In the city's quieter neighborhoods, entrepreneurship often spills over into residential streets. Amid row houses and single-family homes, a bodega or auto-repair shop appears suddenly, peeking out of an illegally converted garage.
The unauthorized conversion of houses into businesses is a particular problem in neighborhoods with high concentrations of recent immigrants from countries where setting up shop at home is common practice. 
 And among them Corona, stands out. Thought by many to be the home of the fictional Archie Bunker, and a symbol of white parochialism in the 1970's, Corona accounts for almost half of the establishments closed in Queens in the last 18 months. And Queens accounts for almost 75 percent of the investigations in the city.
The problem has grown acute in the last five years, said Mary Sarro, district manager of Community Board 3, which covers East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights and northern Corona, areas that have seen a great influx of Hispanic and Asian immigrants in the last decade.
While immigrant entrepreneurs have revitalized the neighborhood, the trend has also meant zoning violations. Houses are altered, additions wedged between buildings, oddly transforming streetscapes and changing the lives of residents who have to coexist with a furniture manufacturer or beauty parlor.
"It's a free country, but they don't realize you can't do whatever you want," said Ms. Sarro, who estimates that there are about a dozen such places operating in her district, most of them in northern Corona.
On 98th Street, near 37th Avenue, five garages are squeezed between an apartment building and a row house. On an otherwise quiet residential street the other day, a deafening sound came out of a welding shop housed in two of the garages.
In the other three, Carlos Torres worked on a Chevrolet Celebrity and Volkswagen Jetta out of a makeshift auto-repair shop. With little space inside, the cars' rears jutted out onto the sidewalk. Mr. Torres charges $25 to fix a car's shocks or brakes, far less than the going rate.
Until last year, he said, he worked at a nearby shop that paid him only $300 a week, so he and his brother Richard rented the garage to set up their own business. Mr. Torres, 36, said he knew it was illegal, but he did not have the money for a legitimate auto-repair shop in a commercial zone. Back home in Ecuador, he said, he would have faced no such problems. "You can buy a house and open a shop in the backyard," he said. "There's no problem. At the end of the year, you pay little tax. That's why I love my country.
"I love this country, too," he quickly added. "But there you can relax more."
The City Council passed a new law 18 months ago to make it easier to padlock such businesses. Before that, officials said, many people opened illegal businesses in residences with the intention of staying for two or three years: the time it took the city to close them.
A bodega on 93d Street and 31st Avenue was closed last week, only four months after residents complained. Like many other illegal bodegas, this one was a squat concrete structure, 20 feet by 20 feet. Maria Valerio, who lives on the first floor of the adjoining row house, said her husband, Manuel Gomez, built it two years ago in the space reserved for parking and had been operating it since then.
Andre Wimberly, 31, who lives across from the bodega, said some residents had complained because teen-agers milled around the store, drinking beer and urinating outside. "But it wasn't that bad," he said. "I could just cross the street and get a soda." NORIMITSU ONISHI
 
 
There Is a Law
 The padlock law passed by the City Council in March 1993 makes it possible to shutter businesses operating out of residences if they are found to be a public nuisance. That is easier to do than proving them to be hazards to the community, the prior requirement.
Since then, department inspectors have investigated 357 complaints in the city; 257 were from Queens. In most cases, said Vahe Tiryakian, a Buildings Department spokesman, the complaints prove unwarranted. Fourteen businesses have closed or been closed after being notified; 16 more closed before the city obtained permission to padlock them. Of the 30, 21 were in Queens, more than half in Corona and Jackson Heights.
Under the new regulation, a judge in the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, after weighing evidence from all parties, submits a recommendation to the Buildings Commissioner, who may order the building closed. The process now averages six months, though it can take up to 10.
"Because we are in effect taking away someone's property, it has to be done seriously and carefully," Mr. Tiryakian said. N.O.

HEADLINE: This Nanny's Life

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
SHE seems like the dream nanny. She has 10 years of experience, a sturdy and serene manner and a spotless record (always punctual, never been dismissed, never had an emergency on the job). She can monitor a carriage-bound infant, riffle through the racks in a clothing store and carry on a coherent conversation at the same time. She knows the playground circuit, the American Museum of Natural History and the pizza parlors on Broadway like the back of her hand. She wants to be paid on the books.
And yet, come September, Jan S. will be looking for a job. 
 "When you get settled in with a family, it's hard to have to move," said Jan, a 37-year-old Guyanese grandmother whose demeanor masks a quick sense of humor. "But that's the way it is. Nothing is forever."
She knows that for a fact. She has had eight different jobs in those 10 years, not counting some part-time baby-sitting she did as a newly arrived immigrant. She has seen the four corners of Manhattan from behind the handle grips of every conceivable style of stroller. All but two of her jobs have lasted six months or less, because the parents left the city or, in one case, decided to stop working. Her latest employers, an Upper West Side couple who hired her in April, delivered the bad news a couple of weeks ago. They're moving to Westchester County.
Jan and the city's untold numbers of nannies know well what it's like to care for someone else's child day after day, wiping noses and drying tears, changing diapers and washing clothes, filling formula bottles and fixing sandwiches. It is a business arrangement in which love is an essential ingredient, but so is money, where the hours are long, the thanks sometimes minimal and the attachment to the child great (though the parents can be another story).
It is also an arrangement interwoven with issues of class and race, issues that Jan tends to brush past on her way to all those baby-sitting jobs and, ultimately, a better life.
"I had my own home, and you come here and it's totally different," she says. "But you come here for a reason."
Jan, who asked that her full name not be used out of her and her employers' concern for privacy, has spent plenty of time awash in her own tears, yearning for the two daughters she left behind in Guyana when she first emigrated. Once they joined her, she struggled to raise them as a single parent in an unfamiliar city. She has sustained herself with hard work and religion, always believing that she did the right thing. And as good as she is, she and the other nannies all over the city -- descending in threesomes into Riverside Park, parading along the Promenade in Brooklyn Heights -- live with the constant worry that the lure of the suburbs, the maturing of the children or the ambivalence of working parents will leave them, the nannies, looking for work all over again.
 
COMING TO AMERICA
 "I should consider myself an Irish nanny," Jan said with a lilt and a laugh, "because I'm very lucky with The Irish Echo. I really believe in The Irish Echo."
She has found three jobs, including her latest one, through The Echo, a weekly paper whose front pages are filled with news of Irish sports and politics but whose back pages are a gold mine of classified ads placed by and for baby sitters here in New York. Most of the time, the unemployed are from the Caribbean, although there are usually some Irish candidates in there, too. "Reliable and conscientious" were the key words in Jan's ad, placed (out of courtesy) by her last employer.
Jan was born not on the Emerald Isle but in Guyana, one of 10 children. Her family, which traces its ancestry to India, owned a farm near Georgetown, the capital, and she began her working life selling oranges, tangerines, scallions and other produce at a little stand there. "Coming here, the work was not the problem," she said. "It was just that you had to work under someone."
Her parents taught her their Hindu faith, and she still goes to a temple in Queens when she can, surrounded by others who pray and bring offerings of fruit. She fasts once a week, usually on Thursdays. Married at 16, she gave birth to a daughter when she was 17, and another followed two years later.
She sensed, though, that Guyana was not the place for her and her family. Despite the lush beauty of the countryside, inflation was rife and prices out of kilter with reality. When she and her husband divorced, she decided to join an exodus that has made the Guyanese one of the fastest-growing immigrant groups in New York. (Frank S. Vardy, chief demographer for the Department of City Planning, estimates that there are now 100,000 Guyanese in the city.)
"In our village, actually, all of them are here," said Nora Singh, a nanny from Goedfortuin, on the western coast of Guyana, watching the little boy she cares for clamber in and out of a sandbox in Riverside Park. "In every home, one member comes here and then sends for the others."
Jan was the first of her immediate family to leave. In 1983, "all alone," she said, she bought a plane ticket to Toronto, where she had relatives. She moved to New York in 1984. The word from other Guyanese she met here was, look for a baby-sitting job.
"A couple of years ago, we were all basically housewives," she said, describing her family as middle-class in Guyana. "You come here, you get baby-sitting."
 
GOING TO WORK
 Jan's first job was a live-in position in New Jersey, the kind most nannies hate. "They were nice people, but you had to wait until they finished eating before you could eat," she said. "And I had to sleep in the basement. It scared me so much that now I can't ever rent a basement apartment. They had fixed it up, but when you go down to the basement, it's just you and you alone."
She lasted six months. She quit when she landed her first full-time, live-out job, caring for a newborn boy on East 29th Street. Since then, all of her jobs have been with newborns, and all of the children, by coincidence, have been boys.
"To be with a kid when they're young, well, they grow with you and it works," Jan said. Once, when she was between jobs, an agency sent her to a house where the children were older. One of them, a little girl, spat on her, and she has never forgotten it.
All this time, she was missing her daughters, whom she had kissed goodbye and left with relatives when they were 7 and 10.
"It was very hard," she said, shaking her head. "I went through my lonely days, my crying days, my depressed times. I called them, but it was not enough." In her anguish, she turned to religion, she said, and showered affection upon the little boys she took care of.
In 1986, Jan went home to Guyana to get her green card, and her daughters, who by then were 10 and 13 years old.
"When I saw them, I was so overwhelmed that I was there with them," she recalled. "My feelings were so numb." Sometimes she thinks of that period as her three lost years. "But I had to do what I had to do. It was for them because the country was getting hard. I said, I have to do something positive for them."
After she returned to New York with her children, her bosses decided to move to Westchester. With the burdens of single parenthood on her shoulders, she then held a series of short-term jobs -- two months with a family on Bleecker Street, four months on West 74th Street (they went to Westchester), six more months in an adjoining building on 74th (they moved to Connecticut), then three months with a family where the mother finally decided to stay home.
Loving, and then leaving, a series of children, Jan says, has never been a problem, though each new job means adjusting to a fresh set of employers.
"That just comes naturally," is the way she explains it. "I need to work, and I love kids and all my jobs were with wonderful people."
 
THE GOOD JOB
 Then Jan finally got the job that offered her a rare combination of stability and personal growth. This was in 1990, when she was hired by a woman she calls Denise to care for her newborn son. She stayed for four and a half years, which perhaps was the best part, not having to look for work every few months.
"I started at $310 a week, working 8 A.M. to 6 P.M., five days a week," she said. "She had someone cleaning as well, every other week. Then I asked her if I could do the cleaning. By the time I left her, I was making $425 a week, with the cleaning.
"They were wonderful. In a year, I didn't ask for a raise. The first year, they gave me a bonus of one week's pay. The second year, it was two weeks, and when I left, they gave me $1,000."
There was money, and there was caring. If she worked late, she got overtime -- $10 an hour, in addition to her salary. "And she sent me home in a cab," Jan recalled. "She always had my best interests at heart."
By most nanny standards, Jan had hit the jackpot. "Employers don't like to pay," thundered a nanny who was holding forth one recent afternoon from a bench in Riverside Park's Henry Neufeld Playground, where sculpted elephants as plump as Gerber babies spray water from their trunks. "When I demand that I be paid properly, I say to my employer, I am Class 1 baby sitter. I am not just any baby sitter."
Once her son started school and she only needed a sitter part of the day, Denise paid for Jan, who had abandoned high school for marriage and motherhood, to take a high-school equivalency course. Everything was glorious, Jan said, until earlier this year, when the family moved to Boston.
Still, she has kept in touch, with cards and letters. When the family visits New York, she goes to their hotel to say hello and sometimes, to baby sit, too.
"We got so much attached and so close," she said. "Whenever they come here, they call me."
 
A DAY IN THE LIFE
 Jan's day begins in Jamaica, Queens, at 5:30 A.M., when she rises to get herself ready for work. She dresses in child-resistant clothes -- a T-shirt and skirt or jeans -- and adds lipstick and understated earrings.
She's on the subway by 6:30 or so, for a commute that takes at least an hour, riding with her eyes closed to seize a last bit of rest. If she is tired during the day, she can doze while the baby is napping.
She took her latest job at a cut in pay -- for $7.50 an hour, with hopes of a raise to $8 -- but since the job is ending, that raise isn't likely. Because she is paid on the books, income taxes and Social Security are deducted from her pay, and she is entitled to workers compensation, disability and unemployment insurance.
Jan's day revolves around the baby's needs. But she says her employers, a lawyer and a therapist, don't mind if she shops for herself sometimes while wheeling him around. She straightens up their apartment as if it were her own, plumping chair cushions and packing away toys. "When I'm at work, I feel like I'm home," she said. Recently she cooked some curry, so her employers could sample Guyanese cuisine.
Few baby sitters like to hang around the apartment all day. The other day, Jan took the baby to the Museum of Natural History, where, though he is only a few months old, she said he appeared to enjoy watching other children run and shriek past the gemsbok diorama and the big whale. When they are out together, she is the steady hand that guides him through the city, responding to the tiniest noise from his end of the stroller, quick with bottles, hats and Pampers to keep him content.
Often she meets up with a friend, another Guyanese baby sitter whom she has known for the last six years. "We always go together," she said. "You need someone to interact with, to let your day go by."
Together they check out the wares at stores like Kids Are Magic, a clothing and toy shop on Broadway near 83d Street. When it was so hot this summer, they would head for the big Barnes and Noble nearby, not for the story hours but "because it was cool."
How does Jan feel about being a paid, substitute parent for someone else's child?
"We are there during the day," she said. "That's the way you look at it. I have my hours that I work, and when I'm done, I'm done."
Most days she's done by 6, then back on the swaying, rumbling subway for the long ride home to the three-bedroom apartment she shares with her elder daughter, who recently gave birth to Jan's first grandchild.
On the subway the other afternoon, a man with a deformed arm approaches her for money, but she doesn't give. She is not sure what he will spend it on.
She lives beyond the last stop of the F train, and when she emerges from the station she sees the sun-scorched, low-rise streetscape of eastern Queens. There is a nameless car service nearby that advertises, "Ladies Feel Safe." There is the Midland Grocery, where one can buy American and West Indian foods. An OTB branch near the station is crowded with local horse players, all eager for a break.
Jan's daughter meets her near the subway station with a sleepy granddaughter in tow. "Hellooooo," Jan coos, taking the baby in her arms and flashing a brilliant smile. "How are you today?" And to her daughter: "Where's her hat?" Then the three generations set off down the sidewalk together.
 
THE BAD JOB
 Nearly every nanny, it seems, has a bad-job tale to tell. Often it is that first job, living in. Sometimes it is a matter of the parents' attitudes toward child care. Jan always has an eye out for that kind of thing.
"I had an instance earlier this year," she said, "and I told the mom I couldn't stay there. She was in her 40's, and she was very nervous about her son. She wanted things done a certain way. She said she'd seen kids in the street, sitting in their strollers looking depressed. After two weeks, I told here I don't think this is going to work."
More common, though, are parents who just don't know how to treat a nanny. Jan has a friend who was hired to take care of twins. "Every morning when she goes in, she has to clean 17 bottles and then fill them again," she said. "When the babies are sleeping, she has to do the cleaning. She has to do the ironing. And this is for $325 a week. She sat down one day to take her coffee and her bagel. The minute she got up, her boss said, 'Bibi, can you clean the bathroom?' "
Bibi is looking for a new job, too, Jan said.
Rhonda Allayn, another veteran nanny, plans to go back to Barbados in two years.
"Please," she said, sitting on a playground bench in Riverside Park while the child she cared for drew with colored chalk on the pavement. "I've had enough of this."
Her first job seven years ago, as a live-in maid on Long Island, lives fresh in her mind.
"I worked 16 hours a day for $200 a week," she said. "That was no money. You had to clean the whole house, and the house was humongous. And you had to wear a pink or blue uniform with buttons down the front. The day I was ready to leave was the day they fired me. I was going home. There was no way I was going to be a slave."
Ms. Allayn progressed to four more jobs, all of them live-out. But now she is studying interior design. She also wants to write a book about her nanny experiences.
"A lot of Caribbean women come here without knowing anything," she said. "They're very strong and very spiritual, so you wouldn't find them committing suicide. They come and they love and they nurture. It's hard for them to have children and leave them and come here and love someone else's children."
Perhaps even in the worst jobs, there is an ultimate benefit: "What we all feel is that if we can cultivate some kind of tolerance, maybe the next generation won't be so racist," Ms. Allayn said. "Maybe they'll remember when they grow up that they had black nannies who loved them."
 
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
 In the inevitable next round of interviews, Jan will be looking for someone with whom she senses an affinity. "If you get a click, you know it's going to work out," she said. "After a while, they just leave me alone. If I had a boss who was on top of me all the time, I don't think it would work."
After all this time, Jan seems to be doing more screening herself than worrying about whether she'll be hired. She certainly has enough references. "I am a very successful baby sitter," she said, "and I know what I'm doing. I know I don't have any problem getting a job."
Like some of her peers, Jan doesn't see herself doing this forever.
"Baby sitting is a wonderful job," she said, "but I need more benefits and more stability in a job."
Since her current job is just 35 hours a week, Jan is studying accounting -- also Denise's idea -- at a Queens business school. At some point, she hopes to switch to a corporate environment, starting out at the bottom if necessary. And "my goal for next year," she said, is to buy a house, instead of paying $850 a month in rent.
And she is taking driving lessons. "I'm working on my driving," she said. Learning to negotiate city streets and to parallel park might come in handy in her next career.
 
 
Wait One Minute. She Was My Nanny!
 Anne G., an Upper West Side mother of two, became suspicious when her son, who normally played only with boys, started being invited on play dates by a girl in his first-grade class. As it turned out, the play dates were her baby sitter's interviews for what turned out to be her new job. It had all been engineered by the other mother.
"She sent her nanny out to look for a new nanny," is how Anne explains her encounter with nanny-poaching, a phenomenon that, while hardly epidemic, has become one of those things that parents whisper cautiously about these days, another layer of apprehension in the already anxious child-care experience.
"There are a lot of women out there who, I don't know how they sleep at night," said an Upper East Side working mother whose nanny was hired away last spring by someone she knew from her child's school. "It was the most stressful and anxiety-ridden time of my whole life. My daughter had a hard time, because she missed this person, who had lived with us, and I had a new baby in the house."
Not only was Anne worried that her son would feel rejected when he saw the nanny, whom he loved, taking care of another child, the tussle dredged up other conflicts, particularly the working- vs. stay-at-home-mother debate. (The other mother was a lawyer.)
"I think she felt entitled to the best person possible, because she worked," Anne said. "And she made me feel that because I was a housewife, I didn't really need help."
After the nanny quit, Anne tried to negotiate.
The other mother said, "If you think this is going to cause problems, I won't hire her," Anne recalled. "And then I sort of obliquely threatened her with the peer pressure thing. I said everyone else I had talked to about this was horrified." But the nanny was already lost. "It had totally poisoned our relationship," Anne said.
Despite many parents' apprehensions, Nancy Kolben, executive director of Child Care Inc., a nonprofit resource and referral center, thinks some of this happens indirectly. Many people approach a nanny they know to ask if she has any friends, she said. When talk turns to salary, that can act as a trigger for a baby sitter to switch, though other factors, like loyalty and job satisfaction, also come into play.
Ira Weissman, a placement counselor with the Pavillion Agency, which specializes in household workers, says he sees nanny-poaching more often in the suburbs, where there is a demand for nannies who drive. In the city, he added, housekeepers are more often stolen. "People will walk into the kitchen during fancy dinner parties and offer them more money," he said. "It happens all the time." CONSTANCE L.

Nannies to Day Care: a Primer
 Q. What are the options for child care in New York and what do they tend to cost?
A. Generally speaking, having a baby sitter at home is the most expensive form of full-time care. At a rate of $7.50 an hour, or $300 for a 40-hour week, a family would spend $15,600 in salary. Its advantages are that the child is at home among familiar things, can keep his or her own routine, and a parent's long or erratic hours can be accommodated. The disadvantages are that care givers are unregulated, absences are disruptive and parents must rely on their own judgment for hiring, evaluating and dismissing employees, which can be painful.
The city also has 2,520 licensed group day-care centers, which are regulated, give a parent more than one care giver to depend on and allow a child to play with others his or her own age.
In a related but separately regulated category is family day care, in which a person takes care of between three and six children, usually in a home. Family day care providers must register with the New York City Department of Health. There are 5,387 such centers in the city, said Steven J. Matthews, a department spokesman.
Group day care is a fine option for many parents, although demand exceeds the supply, says Toni Porter, director of the Center for Family Support at Bank Street College of Education. In 1989, there were 166,927 spaces available in part-time and full-day programs for children under 6. The city's standards are among the most rigorous in the nation, she said, with high adult-to-child ratios and high staff-education requirements. Last year, families paid an average of $6,800 for full-day care for preschoolers and an average of $10,600 for infants.
There are disadvantages: frequently inflexible hours (many close by 6 P.M.); closings for holidays and vacations, and the unwillingness of some centers to accept children under 6 months of age.
Underground, or unlicensed, day care also exists, and often is not a bargain.
"There are countless illegal family day-care centers," Mr. Matthews said, adding that officials often do not find out about them until there is a problem, like a fire or an outbreak of food poisoning.
For parents who cannot afford private day care, the city has 370 subsidized centers operated by the Agency for Child Development and 169 Head Start centers. For information, call (718) 260-2000.
Q. How can you tell if someone will be a good baby sitter or day-care provider?
gfleadinA. You can't discern everything from the interview. But the following guidelines are offered in a pamphlet available from Child Care Inc., a nonprofit resource and referral service in Manhattan. (Call [212] 929-4999, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. weekdays).
According to the pamphlet, a care giver should: Have a warm, positive personality and appear to enjoy being with children; be attentive to smiles as well as cries; be flexible, patient and understanding; respond quickly to a baby's physical needs; understand different stages of development, and value parents as experts about their children.
Many experts also advise spending time with a baby sitter and the child before making the job official. And occasional surprise visits aren't a bad idea either, to see how things are going when the parents are assumed to be far away.
Q. Is it illegal to hire someone who does not have a green card (a residency permit for the United States, which can lead to citizenship)?
A. Yes, if they have no other documentation, under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. No, as long as the person has a separate document known as work authorization, experts say. Some employers sponsor immigrants for citizenship, which means they can hire them while waiting for the application to be approved, a process that can take 10 years, said Martha Davis, senior staff attorney for the NOW Legal Defense Fund.
Q. What are the tax rules when it comes to paying a baby sitter?
A. Social Security deductions must be made from their paychecks, and the employer must match the amount withheld (the rate is 7.65 percent of salary). Federal, state and local taxes can also be withheld if the baby sitter desires (the alternative is for the employee to pay them independently when filing the 1040 tax return). The employee must fill out Federal tax forms, listing the deductions they wish to take, and you, the employer, must file tax-reporting statements and payments at the end of each quarter.
Employees who work more than 40 hours a week are also entitled to workers compensation, which helps pay medical bills and gives them cash if they are injured on the job and cannot work; disability insurance, which covers work-inhibiting illnesses or injuries sustained off the job, and unemployment insurance, which entitles them to collect a percentage of their pay should the job end.
Baby sitters who are still awaiting their green cards but who log 40 or more hours per week are nonetheless entitled to Social Security payments (if they have a Social Security number) and workers' compensation benefits.
Of course, while it is illegal, many nannies want to be paid off the books, to avoid taxes, and many employers comply.
Q.How much do you have to pay a nanny.
A. Under New York law, household workers (regardless of legal status) are entitled to the Federal minimum wage of $4.25 per hour. After 40 hours, also according to state law, they are supposed to get one and one-half times that hourly wage for every hour they work. Prevailing rates in the city range from $6 to $9 per hour.
Q. Do live-in workers get more or less money?
A. For live-in employees, the cost of room and board may be deducted from the minimum wage, but are not to exceed $1.45 per meal, $1.80 per day for lodging and $3.40 per day for an apartment. They also do not get overtime, but are required to be paid at least $6.37 per hour after the first 44 hours worked in one week.
Q. Can you require a baby sitter to work around the clock, 365 days a year?
A. No. Under New York law, household workers are entitled to one full day off per week. They are also entitled to 30-minute meal breaks. Holidays and vacations are up to the employer, but experienced employers point out that paying for holidays and vacations earns good will with employees.
Q. What makes a good day-care center?
A. Look for the same attributes in the staff members that you would look for in a baby sitter. The center should be safe for babies at various developmental stages, have plenty of indoor and outdoor space for active play, be clean (especially where diapers are changed or food prepared), have age-appropriate equipment and toys in good condition, and offer space for quiet time and napping. Ask to see permits from the Department of Health. C.L.H.

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
IT'S just after 10 A.M. and John R. Fratianni and his team are brainstorming.
Their client is an independent filmmaker, Ayoka Chenzira, whose movie, "Alma's Rainbow," will soon be released on video. The problem: how to draw attention to her film, which has been showing at one small Harlem theater since June. 
 One woman narrows her eyes. "Maybe we could get into the schools, publicize it to kids, hit our target audience that way," she suggests.
Mr. Fratianni frowns. "Dealing with the school system -- it's going to be a painfully slow process," he says.
Another woman leans in. "I have a friend who's a schoolteacher. All you need is one person on the inside, right? Bypass the system," she says, to approving nods around the table.
This is clearly not the conversation of TriBeCa movie executives. The office -- a cramped, second-floor conference room -- overlooks the teeming sidewalks of Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn. And the strategists, who pepper their conversation with phrases like "guerrilla financing," and "bootstrap equity," are soon on to their next client, a cash-poor Caribbean bodybuilder from Flatbush who desperately wants to market his own line of power juices.
Here, in a sense, is a frontier of economic development in New York -- not the courting of large corporations or manufacturers but the effort to help small entrepreneurs, many from minority communities and most with fewer than 20 employees.
Mr. Fratianni and his team are among the leaders of a rapidly expanding program that aids ambitious small business owners who have been hindered by cultural isolation and neighborhood redlining policies. The program, called the Business Outreach Center Network, builds business connections, helps position products and lines up loans to fuel startups and expansions.
The program follows a nationwide trend toward small entrepeneurs.
"This is part of a tremendous shift in the entire framework of economic development," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. "It's very important for New York City, because these types of businesses have by and large been neglected by policy makers until recently."
He added that New York's often balkanized communities are only now beginning to fully realize that their small business interests are the same. "And I know of nothing more powerful than capitalism to overcome ethnic cleavages," he said.
The nonprofit network was created four years ago by Orthodox Jewish leaders in the close-knit community of Borough Park, Brooklyn, to help small business owners there, many of them Yiddish-speaking Russian immigrants, get on their feet or expand thriving young businesses.
It started with the help of $4 million in city, state and Federal grants. Connected by computer, the network now has seven offices around the city -- in Borough Park, Flatbush, Chinatown, the largely Hispanic neighborhood of Hunts Point in the Bronx, in minority areas of Far Rockaway and Staten Island and on West 116th Street in Harlem. Next month it plans to open an office in Bridgeport, Conn.
The program sheds light on the forces that constrain small entrepreneurs. For example, a Chinatown business owner's spotty English and distrust of big banks keep him from getting a loan to expand his store. A counselor who speaks his Cantonese dialect helps him put together a business plan and then finds a bank or other loan program that is likely to give him the money.
Ethnic divisions often work against economic self-interest. Counselors put together business partners from areas whose residents rarely communicate or whose ethnic groups have sometimes been hostile -- a meat distributor from Hunts Point and an exporter from Chinatown agree to find new markets in Taiwan, or a Jewish business finds that its services are needed by a group of black Muslims, for example.
"What most of these businesses need is just someone to hold their hand for a little while," said Paul Chernick, director of operations for the Council of Jewish Organizations, and the man who came up with the idea for the network. "There've been precious few places they can go to."
Tom Lam, who co-owns an audio parts distributorship in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, said he came to the network in Chinatown after he and his partner tried to negotiate a loan. "We took one look at what you have to do to get it and we put the application away," he said recently, on a visit to his business counselor, Vicky Cheng, on Canal Street.
"By the time we got through, we wouldn't need the loan," said Mr. Lam, who was born in Hong Kong. "We would be out of business." But with Ms. Cheng's help he found that much of the $90,000 in speakers, receivers and other stereo parts he had in inventory could serve as collateral.
"Tom speaks English very well and even used to work for a bank," said Ms. Cheng. "There are many others in Chinatown who were raised to think that a bank is only a place where you put your money. To borrow other people's money is something we have to work to make them comfortable with."
The network has now served more than 1,000 businesses, with about half of its active clients having been open less than six months. It has drawn up formal agreements with dozens of service organizations around the city -- ranging from banks and accounting firms to business colleges and government agencies -- to make them aware that it will be sending business owners their way for money or technical help.
"The time was ripe for an invention like this," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner for the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "There's been no real infrastructure out there to help small businesses of this kind and so somebody finally got the bright idea to help it develop an infrastructure of its own."
The network is just now beginning to have the capability to connect two merchants, or lead a buyer to a seller, a service that officials hope to expand dramatically as its information becomes more sophisticated and neighborhoods learn to work together.
In one recent successful case, Bernard Samet, the co-owner of Great Neck Party Rental on Long Island, originally went to the Borough Park network office for help with an expansion loan, which he received.
But in doing so he also found out that the Malcolm Shabazz Mosque in Central Harlem, the sponsors of the newest network site, needed to rent a large canvas tent and 1,000 folding chairs for an outdoor speech. The deal was struck early this month, for a reduced rate, and Mr. Samet is negotiating another, larger deal with the mosque that could help him in paying off his loan.
"I have to say I don't think I had ever set foot in that part of Harlem before the day I went to set up the tent," Mr. Samet said. "But before you know it, we were happily ever after. We needed each other, you know? A tent's a tent and a chair's a chair."

Chart: "DONE DEALS: Small Business, Big Help"
 Four deals either brokered, or helped along, by Business Outreach Center networks:
 
A Hunts Point tofu manufacturer needed to expand bu was in a "red-lined" area. It now has a verbal commitment for a $275,000 loan.
 
Shaikh Abduk Sabur, a Harlem street vendor, wanted to open a fragrance business. AFter getting help in finding, renting and renovating retail space, he opened onWest 116th Street.
 
Barbara Naspo, developing a gift-basket business in her Staten Island home, needed warehouse space for basket assembly and retail space for a showroom. She received a $110,000 Federally sponsored loan. Her business will open next month.
 
A Flatbush clothing store needed to advertise but could not afford it. A WNYC television show needed advertisers. It agreed to air a 15-second ad for a reduced rate if the store provided the wardrobe for its commentators.

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
A License to Sell

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
MICHAEL J. CORTES serves those who only stand and wait.
He works as New York State's first and only authorized license plate salesman. His sales territory is confined to the blocklong lobby of the motor vehicles office on Worth Street in lower Manhattan, where he plies the captive audience of motorists shuffling along in the serpentine lines. 
 The notion of a state employee actually helping the public may shock weary Worth Street veterans who remember the agency as a hopeless Marxist bureaucracy modeled after both Karl and Groucho.
But in the 1990's, the agency is reinventing itself. Now it extols customer friendliness, lower costs and revenue growth. Innovations include toll-free numbers and an express office at 34th Street and Eighth Avenue with almost instant service.
Officials say they have even succeeded in shrinking the geologic waits at the Worth Street office. Although the lines are typically down to 30 minutes or less, they have not been totally eliminated -- fortunately for Mr. Cortes.
"On good days, I average 20 plates," he said recently, strolling along his beat. That may not seem like much. Even the idea of a license plate salesman sounds superfluous. After all, the law requires vehicles to have plates, as the waiting line attests. So why does anyone need to hawk them?
The answer is that the products Mr. Cortes sells are not standard-issue, white-bread plates with the Statue of Liberty. Instead, he offers new customized varieties with a choice of colored emblems for nine New York sports teams and 11 regions of the state, with the borough or county name.
After this year's hockey championship game, the motor vehicles had Stanley Cup commemorative plates ready to order the very next morning. Since the program started in March 1993, Mr. Cortes estimates he has sold 5,000 plates. Because they yield extra fees, his sales have added more than $300,000 to the state treasury -- earning him an in-person thank you from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. Jean Rosenthal, the program's director, said, "It's a win-win situation that gives people a fun way to express themselves that's higher class than bumper stickers."
As a salesman, Mr. Cortes's gimmick is that he really doesn't have one. He offers information in an amiable, factual, low-key fashion. Standing and talking all day requires comfortable shoes, and he said, "I keep fully stocked with cough drops and throat lozenges.
"I developed my own approach. I walk up and down the line and talk to everybody who gets on it. When I tell them they can have plates with the county name or sports team of their choice, their eyes light up."
His routine pitch: "See the new-style plates -- sports teams and regional plates. You can get them now, today." While talking, he extends his right hand and adroitly flips through sample plates. "Yankees, Knicks, Rangers, Mets. Check this out: the Stanley Cup limited edition." His right hand fans out leaflets. "Brochures are free. You can order anything in the brochure."
When someone nibbles, Mr. Cortes, 27, follows up with facts on the fees, which plates are available on the spot and which ones are mailed in three weeks. (All plates are made by inmates at Auburn state prison.) When people decide to buy, he takes them out of line -- a small bonus -- and escorts them to a cashier's window.
"I'm very much interested in getting a set," said James Chambers, a tugboat captain. "It's wonderful. Anything that promotes the city is great." Another interested man lamented that he had limited cash. A check or Visa card would do, Mr. Cortes said, but the man didn't have those, either. Mr. Cortes chuckled: "That's a nice watch. Maybe you can work something out."
Although custom plates are catching on -- 67,000 out of 10 million sets statewide -- many people are still unaware of them. "I never knew about it -- I didn't know you could do this," Iakovas Patestas of Queens said as Mr. Cortes help him order plates with the city skyline and his wife's name, Angie.
With the help of sales agents like Mr. Cortes, officials hope custom plates will eventually corner a tenth of the market. "We'd like to clone Michael," said Mr. Rosenthal, who hopes to have Mr. Cortes train people at other offices around the state. "Manhattan is our highest office in sales, and I know for a fact that he is responsible for almost all of that."
Besides selling plates, Mr. Cortes acts as a roving trouble-shooter. If you're on the wrong line, he points you to the right one. If you don't have the right form, he will help get it. If your paperwork is in order, he reassures you. That additional contact and friendliness also sell more custom plates.
Richard C. Diaz, the office manager, said: "We were looking for somebody with the right personality. We put Michael out there because he showed us something, a certain quality of niceness. He's just exceptional, and it shows in his salesmanship."
Just two years ago Mr. Cortes, a Manhattan resident, was unemployed, having lost his job in the recession. In 1992, the motor vehicles agency hired him as a cashier. Then he volunteered for the selling job "because it was something different."
Unlike business salesmen, Mr. Cortes earns no commissions. Some grateful customers offer tips, which he declines. Lazaro Pigueiras of Manhattan, who bought Giants plates, paid him a compliment not often heard in the lobby in years past: "He's a very good guy and knows how to do his job."
Besides sports and regional plates, a proliferating new category is made up of plates advertising, and sold by, special groups -- St. John's alumni, Korean War veterans, hypnotherapists, ham radio operators and others.
Prices vary. Replacing regular plates with sports plates on a typical car costs $39.50 plus an extra annual fee of $25. Adding personalized letters or numbers -- a "vanity" plate -- raises the cost to $68 and the annual fee to $50. So far, custom plates have produced $3 million statewide.
Not everyone on line spends the extra money. Some are even dubious of Mr. Cortes. "They think I'm here doing something crooked," he said, "but I show them my I.D." One man scoffed at the plates for giving free advertising to sports teams and said, "They should be paying us to use them." Mr. Cortes smiled and said, "Tough crowd today."

Chart: "CUSTOM PLATES: Logos to Go "
 The customized license plate for New York City depicts a classic skyline vista: the Brooklyn Bridge against the backdrop of Manhattan skyscrapers.
"Women tend to go with the regional plates -- they like the designs," said Michael Cortes, who sells license plates for the state.
Another option is plates with sports logos, which Mr. Cortes's informal market research shows appeal mostly to men. "The Yankees are doing well, and the Knicks are still selling like hotcakes," he said.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/The Multilevel Concept;
New Stores Make Shopping A Many-Tiered Experience

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
NEARLY 20 years ago, Selma Weiser, who owns the Charivari apparel chain, was walking down a Paris street and fell in love with a store.
"It had mezzanines and staircases, lots of different selling levels that you could see from the street," recalled Jon Weiser, Mrs. Weiser's son and now Charivari's president. "Mom thought the store was a visual kick." 
 No matter that this kind of layout went counter to the retailing wisdom of the day: that only in department stores would customers travel between floors to buy full-priced merchandise. Charivari rented a store on 72d street and Columbus Avenue, pulled out the floor, relocated the pipes, and built a hodgepodge of upstairs, street-level and basement selling floors.
"When we did it, even our landlord was shocked," Mr. Weiser recalled. "Today, everyone loves it. It's like a playground for grownups, and it's still one of our most profitable stores."
Why retell this ancient history now? Because throughout Manhattan, operations as diverse as Duane Reade drugstores and Calvin Klein are opening multilevel stores. And brokers keep pointing to Charivari and the handful of other, older success stories to reassure the new clients that they are not making a terrible mistake.
"Retailers have it in the back of their heads that customers just won't go up or down to buy," said Richard Evans, a vice president at the retail brokerage New Spectrum. "But they no longer have much choice."
Indeed, many retailers, particularly high-priced designers who want to showcase their entire lines, have discovered that they either cannot find, or cannot afford, large enough street-level stores to accommodate the merchandise they want to display. Their problem has been welcome news to landlords, many of whom are finding that second floors and basements that they could barely give away are turning into valuable retail assets.
"I can't tell you how many owners have started to call their basements 'shopping concourses,' " said Benjamin Fox, a partner in New Spectrum.
Owners and their agents readily own up to that. "We used to throw a basement in free when we rented a store," said Joseph J. Sarno, an associate director at Cushman & Wakefield who represents several buildings. "Now we actually market basements as full selling space."
The multilevel bonanza is particularly evident on chichi Madison Avenue, where huge stretches on which stores were once confined to eye-level space have been converted to multistory retailing. On the east side of Madison between 69th and 70th Streets, three multistory stores -- Fila, Madison Avenue Bookshop and Clifford Michael -- all have second-floor selling areas that are easily seen from the street. And now that visual effect is about to be echoed by the high-fashion stores one block south.
Valentino is about to start selling out of the second floor above its store between 68th and 69th Streets. Versace, its next-door neighbor, is also expanding to the second floor. Tse Cashmere recently moved onto the block as a multilevel store. Max Mara will be anchoring the block with a multilevel store on the northeast corner of 68th and Madison.
William Wagner, an independent broker who represents most of the buildings on the block, says he has another two-story retail lease out for 821 Madison, a vacant building on that same block. "Any landlord with half a brain is going after multilevel stores," Mr. Wagner said.
The economics work in everyone's favor. Retailers accustomed to paying $250 a square foot for ground-floor space in a chic area can get the second floor for $50, the basement for $15. Even though landlords are actually renting less space -- retailers generally cut deals for "usable" space, as opposed to "rentable" space, which includes useless nooks and crannies -- they are still coming out ahead, in that they would never get $50 a square foot from office or residential tenants.
"WE'VE recommended to many landlords that they rethink their second floors as retail," said Richard Seligman, a senior managing director specializing in retail at the Edward S. Gordon Company.
The list of new multilevel stores is formidable. Brioni of Italy has leased a retail condominium in the Four Seasons Hotel, at 57 East 57th Street, that combines basement and street-level selling space. Calvin Klein will open a 20,000-square-foot, three-level store at 654 Madison, on 60th Street, next spring. Warner Brothers, the Gap, Crate and Barrel, Chanel, Armani, Brookstone, Prada -- all have gone the multilevel route.
And brokers report more deals in the works. Virginia M. Pittarelli, a senior managing director at KTR Retail Services Group, says she is about to close three deals for multilevel stores, all for designers opening their first New York stores and wanting to display their entire lines.
"They know they will not get the same sales at an upper or lower level that they get on the street floor," Ms. Pirrarelli said. "But they also know that if they want to be on a really good street there is not enough space at street level to carry a full product line."
Even where space is available it is rarely affordable for any but the most deep-pocketed retailers.
Stephen Werther could probably have found 4,300 square feet of ground-floor space in the East 80's for Portico Kids, the two-level children's store he opened at 1167 Madison Avenue, near 84th Street, last year. Instead, he took 800 square feet on the ground floor and 3,500 square feet above that.
"Sure, I'd rather sell on one floor, but it was simply more cost-effective to take second-floor space," Mr. Werther said.
Sellers of low-priced merchandise, who rely on high volume to justify their fixed costs, are in an even worse economic bind. They know their sales will drop in a multilevel store; but they are simply unable to carry lavish street-floor rents.
Take Duane Reade, the fast-growing drugstore chain. Bruce Weitz, its chief executive, lists a litany of what's wrong with multilevel stores: They are expensive to build and to staff; they make it hard to spot when a floor person should be deployed to help a customer, or when customers should be routed to less crowded cash registers; they require extra security.
And they are a merchandising nightmare for a business that relies heavily on impulse buyers -- people who come in to fill a prescription or buy a tube of toothpaste and then pick up various sundries that catch their eye. In a multilevel store there's often an entire floor of wares that a hurrying customer won't see.
"Nothing sells as well when people have to walk up or down stairs," Mr. Weitz said.
Yet a dozen of Duane Reade's 50-or-so New York stores operate on more than one level. For those stores, Mr. Weitz's choice was clear: Either open on more than one level or don't open at all.
"Take the Empire State Building," Mr. Weitz said, referring to one of Duane Reade's multilevel sites. "Do you really think a discount drugstore could find or afford 8,000 square feet of street-level space there?"
Such rhetorical questions aside, some retailers still go through design hoops to avoid multilevel selling. Last year Smith & Hawkins, an outdoor furnishings and plant retailer based in Berkeley, Calif., was looking to open a 7,000-square-foot store in New York. Ms. Petarelli, its broker, tried to persuade its managers to open a multi-level store. They refused.
This spring Smith & Hawkins will open on one level at 394 West Broadway in SoHo. It will have an extended selling porch in front, a selling balcony attached to the rear windows -- and with all that, it will still have just 4,200 square feet of selling space.
"They had just heard too many scary stories about the problems of multilevel selling," Ms. Petarelli said.
Joel Fisher, the 9 West Group's senior vice president for real estate and store planning, also shuns more than one selling level. By year's end, 9 West will have 15 shoestores operating in New York, 10 of them opened since 1992. Each does all its selling on the street-level floor.
"New York City customers are limited in time, they want to get in and get out," Mr. Fisher said. The huge saving in rent attained by venturing off the ground floor becomes less attractive, he notes, when one factors in the additional sales staff and security needed with a second level.
Multilevel stores can indeed be expensive to build and run. They require staircases or elevators and fancy interior designs to entice people in from the street. When they entail converting office or storage space to selling space, they require a change of use certificate from the New York City Buildings Department. And the department will not issue such a certificate unless the space conforms to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
That alone has kept some landlords from marketing off-grade space for retail. "A lot of owners don't want to let an inspector into their buildings," said one retail broker who insisted on anonymity.
And the physical, financial and regulatory problems pale in comparison to the sheer sales problem of getting customers to move up or down. Multilevel retailers have found that out the hard way.
When Mr. Werther opened Portico Kids, he put impulse items -- lamps and pillows and books and such -- on the ground floor and higher-ticket furniture items upstairs.
"It took us six months to realize that no one was going upstairs, because no one realized what else the store sold," Mr. Werther recalled. Mr. Werther rearranged the store so that the downstairs is a "snapshot of what the upstairs is about," with at least one piece of each kind of merchandise it carries. Sales, he said, have picked up considerably.
"It took a year for word of mouth to really generate business," he said. "If we'd been on one level it would have taken a month."
SIMON PEARCE had an even worse problem at the 5,000-square-foot glassware and furniture store it opened on 59th Street between Park and Madison Avenues in October 1992. Four-fifths of the store's selling space is in the basement, with no natural light and unspottable from the street. That configuration almost spelled disaster for the store. Floor-to-ceiling window displays made it hard to see the staircase from the street. And from inside, a huge walnut display unit hid the staircase from many angles.
"Our downstairs was one of the best-kept secrets in New York," recalled Lisa Schorr, the store's manager.
In the last year Ms. Schorr removed the display unit and the tall window displays. Like Mr. Werther, she changed the merchandise mix so that the street level offered a sampling of wares that could be found downstairs. And she charged one staff person with greeting all customers who walk in and apprising them of what's downstairs.
Ms. Schorr says that sales between January and August of this year were 75 percent higher than in the same period of 1993.
"I'd still like a second floor better than a basement, and I'd like a one-level store best of all," she said. "But you really can persuade customers to go downstairs."
Of course, some buildings are just better suited to multilevel stores than others. That's certainly true in Rockefeller Center.
Kate D. Coburn, Rockefeller Center's vice president for retail, just leased a two-story store at 630 Fifth Avenue, at 51st Street, to Movado, a seller of high-priced jewelry that is moving from a one-level store on Madison Avenue and 57th Street. Ms. Coburn is certain that it was the nearly 50 feet of window exposure that came with the store that clinched the deal.
"If you're talking 20-foot frontage and no great windows, a multifloor deal just isn't easy to make," she said.
Other Rockefeller Center buildings are on a steep grade, so a store can have two "street-level" entrances that in fact lead to different selling floors. That's the sort of space Brookstone, the upscale giftware comapny, has taken at 620 Fifth Avenue, at 50th Street. The store has a 6,000-square-foot selling level on one "street" floor, an additional 2,000 square feet on the other and tall windows that overlook the skating rink.
"This space, whether it's technically second floor or not, makes a major statement," said Michael Hirschfeld, president of the Hirschfeld Group and Brookstone's broker.
Retailers occupying less architecturally enhanced space are trying hard to avoid the mistakes that Simon Pearce and Portico made the first time around.
Take Prada, the Italian store known best here for its handbags. It has rented 12,000 square feet on four floors at 28 East 70th Street, where it will combine retail and wholesale sales and administrative offices.
"They didn't go ahead with the deal until the architects they flew in from Italy assured them they could get the customer flow they wanted," said New Spectrum's Mr. Evans, who negotiated for Prada.
DATAVISION, a big computer retailer, recently rented 2,000 square feet of retail space at 445 Fifth Avenue, at 39th Street, as well as the 12,000 square feet of commercial space above it. They will show samples of their wares on the first floor, and carry their full stock on the second.
"This gives them enough affordable space to go up against CompUSA across the street," said Faith H. Consolo, a vice president at Garrick Aug Associates, who helped broker the deal.
Many fashion retailers are taking more of the mini-department-store approach, stocking, say, suits on one floor, accessories on another and shoes on a third, so that customers must travel up or down to complete the "look."
In the high-end, service-oriented stores, the same salesperson stays with customers from the time they walk in, and literally leads them up or down the stairs.
Retailers with truly diverse product lines are setting up stores-within-stores. Calvin Klein, for one, is opening a three-level, 20,000-square-foot store at 654 Madison Avenue, at 60th Street, next spring. The entire street-level floor will be devoted to its mainstay women's fashion collection. The upper level will be devoted to the men's collections, while the lower level will feature the Calvin Klein Home collection.
"The store will provide the context for the quintessential modern idea of luxury," Mr. Klein said when he announced his plans in June. Presumably, luxury in the pared-down 90's includes traveling between floors.

Eugene Matthews

BYLINE: By Michael Shapiro; Michael Shapiro has written books on Japan and Korea and teaches journalism at Columbia University.

 BODY:
IN HANOI, WHERE THE EXPATRIATES GATHER on Friday nights for happy hour at the Australian Embassy, Eugene Matthews stands apart. He works his way to the bar, orders a double vodka with soda and lemon juice and finds a place where he will be noticed but not bothered.
He lets people come to him, and when they do, he offers thin smiles and perfunctory handshakes, except to those who, like him, remember a time when only a handful of foreigners gathered on Friday nights.
Matthews, who is 35, is prickly about his position as the American businessman with the longest tenure -- four years -- in Hanoi. He insists that he does not fear competition. What troubles him is the gnawing sense that all the others who have followed -- and the many others who have arrived since February, when President Clinton lifted the 19-year American trade embargo -- have cluttered Hanoi. So he avoids the company of the newcomers. 
 Late at night, after happy hour, after closing time for expatriate-run restaurants like A Little Italian, he goes out and hails a bicycle rickshaw. He tells the driver to follow his directions, which he issues in proficient, though brusque, Vietnamese. They ride down the middle of the empty streets, flanked by willows, the only sound that of rubber on pavement. They ride past the lakes in the center of the city, past aging, mustard yellow French colonial villas. And for the only time in the course of yet another long and purposeful day, both Hanoi and Eugene Matthews are tranquil.
"I like Vietnam," he says. "I like the people. Hanoi is a place you can really fall in love with. But most importantly, I'm here because I'm a businessman."
He appreciates the delicacy of his position in the vanguard of America's return to Vietnam. Vietnam is desperate for foreign investment, technology, markets. Its needs are profound: roads, bridges, hospitals, airports -- and quick and effective courses in the rules and subtleties of doing business in the international marketplace. It is among the poorest countries in the world. Yet despite the country's average annual income of $200, Vietnam's boosters are trumpeting the nation as the next -- and perhaps last -- great Asian frontier, a potential market of 72 million people, more than 50 percent of them under the age of 21, and a highly educated and inexpensive work force.
Since 1986, when the Vietnamese Government instituted its own form of economic restructuring, called doi moi, the country has cut subsidies to its state-owned businesses and spawned a market economy that boasts foreign investment laws that are among the most liberal in Asia. Foreigners can own and manage 100 percent of their Vietnamese ventures. Although there are widespread complaints of bureaucratic tangles and too many hands seeking bribes, Vietnam has attracted $9.2 billion in foreign investment.
"People are saying, 'Vietnam is the greatest thing since chocolate milk,' " Matthews says. "Everybody wants to put money here. The problem is they don't know where. There's a lot of opportunity here, but there are a lot of problems. It's important that people have realistic expectations of the economics of this country.
"There's no capital market in Vietnam, no stock market. You can't sit in Tokyo or Hong Kong and make money in Vietnam. And there's no silver bullet. People here will say to foreigners, 'My cousin knows the Prime Minister.' That's the most familiar line, and people get sucked in. You have to be on the ground to manage your investment here. Otherwise, your Vietnamese partner defines your relationship with the Government, and when problems happen, no one knows you.
"But the biggest mistake comes when people don't recognize what Vietnam has. People say they have no distribution system. But what about the Ho Chi Minh Trail? What about all the goods that get smuggled in from China? It may look a little different, but it's working. Nothing gets lost. Nothing gets wasted."
Matthews, a graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law School, was among those who lobbied a succession of administrations to lift the embargo, insisting that the longer the United States waited to return to Vietnam the further it fell behind the Taiwanese, Japanese, French, Hong Kong, Australian and South Korean banks and companies that had already leased and restored the villas they had chosen as their corporate headquarters in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
Matthews has staked out a position as middleman and financier who brings together and negotiates with American investors and Vietnamese businessmen. "We always like to choose a person who is hungry, and he came across as someone who wanted to make his mark in Vietnam," says Lee Soo-Jin, a senior vice president at American Express who worked with Matthews on a deal that brought the credit card to Vietnam. "He was just very impressive -- his energy, his insights into some of the workings of Vietnam. He does give good advice. He follows up. Sometimes he comes across as a bit arrogant, but that's his style."
But Matthews is also sensitive to the needs, sensibilities and vulnerabilities of Vietnam and its people. He knows there is just so much the market can bear, financially and emotionally. He understands that of the many things that Vietnamese fear, the greatest is of being devoured.
"If they opened this country up the way foreigners want it, you know who'd own this country?" he asks. "All the foreigners. The Vietnamese are very smart people. They've decided they're behind their neighbors and want to catch up. Sometimes they overplay their hand, and those are the deals that never get done. They're so afraid of being exploited."
MATTHEWS LIVES IN CENTRAL Hanoi, on the second floor of the French colonial villa that houses his consulting and investment company, Ashta International. Six Vietnamese and an American work for him, and when he lets them leave at the end of the day, which can mean 8 P.M. or 11 P.M. or later, he programs the phone so that it will ring upstairs, next to his bed.
He exercises sporadically, but does so, as with all things, in excess, as he did when he trained for a triathlon four years ago and forced himself to learn to swim. After working well past midnight to take calls from New York, he is in his office by 8, six days a week. "The Government works Saturdays, so we work Saturdays," he says. "The Vietnamese companies are open. We have a lot of work to do." He brings in pizza for working lunches that he interrupts occasionally to tease the young men who work for him about their girlfriends. He does not mind when they tease him back. When he laughs, he claps his hands and doubles over.
He is surrounded by people on the make -- not just expatriates but Vietnamese as well. From the foreign press-center officials who extract fees for setting up interviews to the old women on the sidewalk who charge a nickel to step on a bathroom scale for a "health check," people everywhere are scrambling for American dollars, the currency of choice.
Matthews's clients include Revlon, Lehman Brothers, MTV, American Express and a large American pharmaceutical company whose name his contract does not allow him to disclose.
It is this company's representatives, on their first visit to Vietnam, who are Matthews's preoccupation this week. He arranges meetings for them with local doctors, pharmacists and hospital administrators, all of whom want to hear just how many billions of dollars this company is worth and how much money it might have to spend. He also takes them to the converted monastery that houses Central Pharmaceutical Factory No. 1, where they are offered a bittersweet lesson in the costs of transforming a society.
The director, a slight 60-year-old man named Vo Huu Duc, greets them and, apologizing for his English, explains why he and so many other managers of state businesses now find it difficult to sleep at night. "I myself don't know what will happen," he says. "I think about what to do tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and the year to come to feed the workers."
Matthews leans forward in his seat, peeling one of the oranges brought by the secretary. He whispers, "The guy is a classic story."
Vo Huu Duc tells how the company was founded in the jungle, during the resistance to the French. It moved to the monastery in 1954, when the French, defeated at Dien Bien Phu, departed. The Government owned his company, set the prices and sent chemicals from a central warehouse. Business proceeded predictably, if not necessarily prosperously.
But since 1989, when the Government cut off subsidies, he says that he has had to cut his work force from 1,200 to 540. Matthews asks whether he has been approached by foreigners, interested in a joint venture. The director, disappointed, says he has not. His market base is stagnant and he has nothing to invest in the oversized, aging plant. His chemists still work with old Polish scales. The laboratories are lined with fading wooden cabinets. "Change is hard to do," he says. "Even though all the buildings are very old, it's not easy to destroy everything and rebuild."
Matthews, having met other men like Vo Huu Duc and heard their laments, wonders whether he will soon be pushed out by a young and eager entrepreneur who will quickly decide to tear down the monastery and build a new plant.
"He'd like to go faster, but he doesn't know how," Matthews says. "But he's a survivor. He has young people working in his company. And he knows he doesn't know."
And that, Matthews explains, is a quality foreigners too quickly overlook when they meet people like Vo Huu Duc and assume he is incapable of change. It is a mistake, he adds, too often applied to the northern half of the country, even by his clients, who sense the south is where there is money to be made.
"It's a society ready to become what we know and expect," Paul Block, chairman of Revlon International, says of southern Vietnam. In Ho Chi Minh City, there is a cafe society that arrays itself along low tables beneath umbrellas on the wide boulevard sidewalks. Men dress casually (in contrast to Hanoi, where they still wear army fatigues) and women wear makeup and perfume and represent, for Block, "people who enjoy their lives. It's like not trying to convince a third-world society. Hanoi is much longer term."
That may be true, Matthews says, but only to a point. "The south is great if you're selling high-volume, low-cost products. In terms of software development, for example, you want to do that in the north. It's two different cultures. The biggest market is Saigon. But the creativity is in the north."
In Ho Chi Minh City, Matthews introduces Block to people like Nguyen Kim Thoa, director of the Saigon Cosmetic Company, who can barely contain her excitement at the prospect, by no means assured, of a venture with Revlon.
Thoa, who wears a diamond ring on one hand and a ruby surrounded by diamonds on the other, manufactures shampoo, soap and detergent. But her two biggest sellers are perfumes named Saigon and Diana. She chose the name Diana, she says, after an American song of many years ago. Saigon perfume is bottled, boxed and sealed in a factory that is really no more than two adjoining rooms filled with people. They fill the perfume bottles from tubes that are sealed with wooden clamps. They glue on the labels with their fingers.
For Nguyen Kim Thoa, Matthews means Revlon, and Revlon, she hopes might mean a $2 million investment in machines and training. The training, Matthews says, is always a part of the deal. "They recognize what has happened to other developing countries where they let the foreigners come in and they end up running everything," he says. "They believe their people have the capacity to learn. The Vietnamese are hungry for information and ready to learn. They don't know what a derivative is, or a bond trade. But they're sophisticated."
EUGENE MATTHEWS GREW up in Sharon, Pa., a steel town outside of Pittsburgh. His father died when he was 5 and his mother when he was 20, and though he has two older brothers -- one is a college professor, the other a social worker -- he has truly been at home in a succession of offices.
He spent a year with Wolf, Block, Schorr & Solis-Cohen, a Philadelphia law firm, where he quickly discovered that he didn't much care for practicing law. Then he decided that Japan held possibilities for someone who immersed himself in its business culture and he moved to a town on the outskirts of Tokyo where he spent the next two and a half years as the only foreign employee of a printing equipment company. He left Japan in 1987 after convincing his employer to grant him exclusive rights to distribute his products in North America and Mexico.
"Japan was my introduction," he says. "It's my home base. My focus is on Asia." He relocated first to New York and then Bangkok, where, supported by his interest in the printing equipment business, he began exploring the possibilities in Southeast Asia. In February 1989, he went to Vietnam for the first time. "It was new. It was untouched. It was stark. People talk about making an impact on an industry. I was going for the country. There was no one else over there."
He stayed for two weeks. He introduced himself to Government officials and the managers of state-run businesses. Among the first people he met was a Ministry of Trade official who spoke with him through an interpreter for two and a half hours and then, having decided Matthews was sincere, shifted to flawless English. He visited every few months. An official at the Foreign Ministry told him that if he was serious about Vietnam he should live there.
"Part of me was jealous," says his lawyer, Thomas Schwarz, a partner at the New York law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. "Part of me thought he was a little crazy."
For three years he lived in a guest house at the Ministry of Education, a bleak concrete dormitory where his kitchen doubled as the bathroom. He came, ostensibly, to learn the language, because the only way to avoid violating America's Trading With the Enemy Act was on a student visa and with the understanding that he earn no money in Vietnam or spend more than $200 a day. He lived on a dirt road that turned to muck on rainy days and where rats the size of cats ran through the waste along the walkways.
He traveled the length of the country, freezing in an unheated railway car on the 48-hour trip from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City one January. He did minimal sightseeing: the ancient capital of Hue, the hill resort of Dalat, the beaches of Nha Trang and, in Ho Chi Minh City, the rusting, shuttered American Embassy.
Matthews stood in front of the gate and looked up at the roof and recalled the photographic image of the last Americans scrambling into helicopters as Saigon fell in 1975. It is one of his few vivid associations with the war. He was too young to fight or protest. Of the many remarkable things about his presence in Vietnam, perhaps the most is the idea of a young American for whom the war has little emotional resonance. "Vietnam," Matthews says, again and again, "is a country, not a war."
EUGENE MATTHEWS DOES NOT believe in making excuses for the Vietnamese. He thinks it patronizing to expect less from them because they are poor and still learning about market economies. "I don't play with them," he says. "It's like with black people, people saying, 'You can't expect a lot from them.' Some people come in and give them too many excuses. But don't sell these people short. These people are strong. You got to come strong with these people. Don't come short."
So he offers his harsh and sometimes gratuitous advice, "because I want them to live up to their potential." He also recognizes that he is not dealing with fools. When Vietnamese solicit bids for projects, he says, they will do so in the vaguest way. The bidders offer their ideas, he says, from which the Vietnamese solicitor will want to choose not one but bits and pieces from each.
"They want to get the best from everyone," he says. And that is why he is useful to them. Matthews harbors no romantic illusions about his relationship with the Vietnamese. He recognizes that it is to his advantage to have gotten there first, but unless he can connect the Vietnamese with capital, the Vietnamese will turn to someone else. Race, he insists, is immaterial. "Many Americans came to talk," says Nguyen Kim Thoa of Saigon Cosmetic. "Mr. Matthews brought Revlon."
With the Vietnamese, he says, he can be blunt and need not perform the polite dance of negotiation required of him in Japan. While his manner may not always be appreciated in Vietnam, it is nonetheless understood.
"Oh, Mr. Matthews, when he first came here he might not have understood Vietnam and he came wanting to meet high-level people because he was from a big country," says Hoang Thi Lan, the deputy director of the Vietcom Bank with whom Matthews negotiated the American Express deal. "Now he's discovered that it's the work people do that's most important." Then she smiles, remembering the meeting, and adds, "He's very American."
Matthews grows wistful when he talks of life, in the distant future, after Vietnam. He talks of a family and a home in Telluride, Colo. He likes Colorado because of its beauty and remoteness. And as he talks of what this life will be like he sounds very much like a man trying to convince himself of a future he thinks he should want. For now, the future is defined by "small simple deals."
They are deals like his $18 million joint venture with Vinamilk, the Vietnam milk company. He believes that milk represents a product that Vietnamese have a willingness -- and the money -- to buy.
"We are here to make an investment," he tells Nguyen Tan Xe, the director of the agricultural services department of the People's Committee in Ho Chi Minh City. "We are also here to make a profit."
With that Xe smiles and tells Matthews that he, too, has a venture in mind, a small sugar refinery.
"How much money?" Matthews asks.
Xe says he doesn't know.
Matthews folds his papers and puts away his pen. As he prepares to leave, he says: "I make you a promise. If Ashta is successful, we will surely make other investments in Ho Chi Minh City. If the first one is profitable."

HEADLINE: Leading the Way in Cutting Health Costs

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI 

DATELINE: OSSINING

 BODY:
THERE is a marquee outside the Open Door Family Health Center that at first glance makes it look like a movie theater.
If it were, the promotion might read, "Now playing in an extended run -- the type of preventive, affordable health care for the uninsured that Congress is still only talking about." 
 While much of the discussion about health care in Washington is only theoretical, this community-based center has for more than two decades been quietly meeting the needs of those who cannot afford to pay the full cost of their medical care.
From modest beginnings in the basement of a church to its current incarnation as a full-service health care center with several satellite offices, Open Door has been visionary in addressing the gaps in access to quality health care.
"Our mission is to insure that those who are least able to pay have maximum access to health care," said Margaret M. Griesmer, executive director of Open Door. "People who are underinsured and uninsured are prevalent in Westchester. They may have no outpatient coverage or no insurance at all. It could be anybody from the small-business employee to the immigrant laborer to the part-time worker."
The health center serves more than 13,000 patients a year. The need for Open Door's services has continued to increase since its opening in 1972. The rising cost of living in Westchester has put medical care even further out of reach for the working poor, and few private doctors in the area accept Medicaid patients.
Meanwhile, new waves of immigrants from Central and South America have added to the number of patients with special needs.
 
Emphasis on Prevention
 Since its beginning, Open Door has focused on primary care for the medically underserved. Traditionally, people with little or no health insurance rarely have their own doctors and have sought medical attention only when an illness becomes serious, often receiving their initial treatment in an emergency room. Not only is such care dangerous to the patient, but it is also unnecessarily expensive.
Staff family care doctors at Open Door treat a broad range of conditions with an emphasis on prevention and health education. Patients are encouraged to have their own doctor to insure continuity of treatment. In fact, large black-and-white photographs of each doctor on the staff grace the lobby of the center, so even those patients who can't remember the name of the doctor who last treated them can point to his or her picture.
Open Door charges its patients on a sliding scale based on income; the average fee paid for a visit is $27. Services include not only primary care but also dental care, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, family planning, mental health services, H.I.V. testing and counseling, podiatry, optometry, audiology and WIC, the federally financed food program for women, infants and children, which is run by a nutritionist. There are also special services for youths and the elderly.
Charles Dietrich, 55, of Bedford Hills came to Open Door on a recent summer day with one of his four sons, Tim, 15, who was complaining of swollen glands.
Mr. Dietrich said he once had health insurance through his union but is now unemployed and unable to afford the premiums to continue coverage. The social security disability benefits he receives make him ineligible for other health care programs, he said.
 
Opposition Expressed
 "I can't get Medicaid because the disability benefits put me just out of range, but I don't have a steady income," Mr. Dietrich said. "I first came nine years ago with my son to see a dentist who I heard was good. When I lost my insurance, we continued coming, but they put us on a sliding scale because I couldn't afford to pay the full price. Places like this are really needed when everything is so tight."
In addition to the Ossining site, Open Door has centers in North Tarrytown and at Westhelp in White Plains. An office in Mount Kisco is scheduled to open this December. A proposed Port Chester center has met with opposition from some residents, but Open Door administrators are now exploring two new possibilities for a site.
Part of the opposition may stem from a misconception about the health center itself, several board members suggested. While Open Door does not turn away patients because of their inability to pay, they are often misconstrued as simply a health clinic for the poor.
"A clinic is a hospital-based training program for residents and other doctors, and that is not what this is," Mrs. Griesmer said. "We have full-time, salaried doctors who are as well qualified or more so than anybody out there. We have a beautiful facility, and we treat our patients well. We also have privately insured patients and accept a lot of managed care plans that are out there. There is a stereotype of community health centers that we are striving to change."
 
Youth Connection Program
 People pay for their medical care at Open Door from a variety of sources. Forty percent of the people are self-paying, while 20 percent are covered by private insurance. Another 35 percent are covered by Medicaid, with the remaining 5 percent covered by Medicare.
Open Door also receives support from county, state and Federal grants as well as through private fund-raising.
Still, the center continues to reach out to the lowest-income segment of the population in the surrounding area. Some 40 percent of its patients are Hispanic, and both language translation and transportation are offered.
The Youth Connection program provides academic tutoring to high school students as well as counseling by a certified social worker. A program called Life Education discusses such issues as sexual behavior, drug and alcohol abuse and family problems.
A career-training program for students in the 10th through 12th grades is also offered.
"The most significant indicator to a healthy adult is a high school education," Mrs. Griesmer said. "If we can keep them from getting pregnant, and staying in high school, their health will be infinitely better."
 
More Money Anticipated
 A separate program offers elderly people in the immedieate area access to medical, dental and specialty care at Maple House Enriched Housing, an affordable housing unit in Ossining.
Though the health center was somewhat of a trailblazer in offering managed care through a variety of payment plans, it may ultimately find itself in the midst of competition for patients. When some version of the health care bill comes into effect, there will almost certainly be more Federal money available for the ambulatory care of people who have been uninsured. The availability of new reimbursement funds may prompt hospitals in the county to open centers and induce for-profit managed-care programs to target people who were previously not covered, Mrs. Griesmer suggested.
She added: "We won't be the only people in this niche. There will be others competing once the dollars get out there. We are looking at integrating our system with other health care services. But we really all have to stop being such cowboys -- hospitals and health centers -- and start talking to each other. Not about what we have to offer, but about what is best for the patients."

HEADLINE: When Broadway Meets the Midway, It's Big Business

BYLINE: By JUDITH BERCK; Judith Berck is a freelance writer based in Iowa City.

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE

 BODY:
ON the surface, state fairs have shed their rustic ways. But at heart they haven't changed much. These giant postcards of Americana have somehow managed not to sacrifice their hog-pulling, cotton-candy roots as they've sprouted into very big businesses indeed.
Just look at the Wisconsin State Fair, which drew close to a million fairgoers at its 11-day run earlier this month. Rural rubbed shoulders with urban, old with new. Farmers in overalls munched turkey legs alongside bikers in Harley-Davidson T-shirts. Local brewery workers and Mediterranean Leghorn roosters stared at each other in the Poultry Barn. Wide-eyed children watched jumpers swan-dive off a 14-story Bungee jump, cheered the Miller High Life Pig Racing contest or climbed the World's Largest Piggy Bank (16 feet high). 
 The Ferris wheel, of course, still turned, but nearby, business people in Ray-Bans and teen-agers in the latest grunge lined up to try the new virtual-reality game. At the 15,000-seat grandstand, the line-up included Reba McIntyre, Motley Crue, the Beach Boys, and Barry Manilow.
The site itself had a tale to tell, too. In 1892, the 200-acre Wisconsin State Fairground was carved out of rural farmland, 10 long miles from Milwaukee. Now, the creeping city has almost engulfed the fairground -- with some of it even lying within the city limits.
But the fair survives -- just one of more than 3,000 in the United States and Canada that are doing just fine in this decidedly non-agrarian age. You can still see exhibits of champion sheep -- which is, after all, where some say it all started: In 1807, a man named Elijah Watson, sometimes called "the father of U. S. agricultural fairs," staged a modest sheep exhibit in Pittsfield, Mass., and the rest is history.
Nearly two centuries later, you can still see pig races, pumpkin-carving contests or farm equipment displays -- but they're interspersed with hundreds of product displays and industry showcases. You can still hear plenty of country music, but heavy metal and rap have found their way in, too. And don't be surprised to find a Karaoke machine next to the saltwater-taffy stand.
That sheep exhibit, in short, has evolved into a diversified, billion-dollar business, with the full weight of corporate sponsorship and civic boosterism mixed in with old-time agricultural showcasing and carnivals. According to Thomas Powell, associate publisher of the trade paper Amusement Business, the estimated 158 million North American fairgoers spend about $300 million a year at the gates, $300 million more on carnival rides, and even more on food, drinks and games. And that doesn't include the millions spent on hotel rooms, restaurants and shopping.
The economic impact of a fair can be considerable. The Eastern States Exposition in West Springfield, Mass., brings an estimated $50 million into the local economy during its run (this year, Sept. 16 to Oct. 2). The Texas State Fair claims a $160 million lift for the Dallas/Fort Worth economy.
And in Milwaukee, "It's like having two major league baseball teams in town each day," said Mayor John O. Norquist. "People from all over the state patronize local hotels, restaurants, bars and other shops."
And nested inside each nonprofit fair is another world unto itself: the carnival. Carnivals are private businesses that travel year-round, setting up and operating their rides on the fairgrounds' midways, then moving on. Many are family-run and decades old, traveling long-established routes. Most have just 6 to 8 rides and may move 5 to 10 miles a week. But these days, many are huge interstate, or even international, businesses, with more than 100 rides.
Carnivals spend only a few days at each event, typically paying 25 to 40 percent of their gross to the fair's nonprofit sponsor, with rides costing $1.50 to $3. In off-season, they play all kinds of events. Dominick Vivona, one of five brothers who run Amusements of America of Englishtown, N.J., said his 120-ride carnival is booked year-round from Florida to Canada. "In the spring we play what we call 'still dates' -- shopping centers, coliseum parking lots, racetracks or stadiums," he said. "Then, in June and July, we start playing our fairs -- county fairs, state fairs, festivals, celebrations."
Carnival revenues can be enormous. "A large carnival, with 60 or 70 rides, has the capacity to gross anywhere from $500,000 to $2 million a week," Mr. Vivona said. And a handful go far higher. Murphy Brothers Expositions, based in Tulsa, Okla., the No. 2 carnival last year, has an annual gross of $30 million to $40 million.
But "if you make a 5 percent profit, you're doing well," Mr. Vivona said. "By the time you pay your percentage of the ride gross, and your insurance, your payroll, your transportation, and your maintenance payments on the rides, there's very little left."
When Mr. Vivona's parents started Amusements of America in 1940, they bought a Ferris wheel for $3,500. Today, though, "a little kiddie ride costs $50,000 to $100,000," said Jerry Murphy, owner and president of Murphy Brothers. "A very big ride costs upwards of $1 million."
Regulation also causes big headaches. "The red tape has become unbelievable," Mr. Vivona said. "If you're a big carnival, and you have to operate from state to state, it has become very difficult and expensive because every state has different safety laws, different permits, different licenses."
Operating a big carnival "is like running a little city," Mr. Murphy said. "You've got to be the mayor, the police chief, the fire department, and everything."
The visitors to that little city, and the rest of the fair, have changed over a century as a population that was 97 percent rural did a back flip to become 97 percent urban or suburban. Not only have people moved to cities, but -- as in Milwaukee -- the cities have often surrounded the fairs.
"A hundred years ago the fair was primarily educational for the farmer, because it showed him different kinds of livestock and seedcorn and produce," said Lewis Miller, general manager of the International Association of Fairs and Expositions. And that past is clearly alive. The Wisconsin fair got about 17,300 entries in 1993 for livestock, home economics, horticulture, and the like. "But the educational value," Mr. Miller said, "has probably become much larger to the city dweller, who comes out and says, 'My goodness, there's a cow being milked.' "
A fair's traditional features, though, bring in little revenue and are in effect subsidized by modern elements. Agricultural associations have long been sponsors. The Wisconsin Bakers' Association, for instance, has been showcasing its products for over 70 years, as have the Wisconsin Beef Council, the Wisconsin Pork Producers and the Wisconsin Poultry Industries.
But corporate participation picked up noticeably in the past decade. "It's cost-effective advertising," said Joe LaGuardia, marketing director of the New York State Fair in Syracuse, which opened on Thursday. "Where else can you reach 86,000 people a day" -- people who are prime consumers "because they're here to look."
And corporate America is becoming quite creative in promoting its products. At the Wisconsin fair, in addition to the Miller High Life Pig Race, you could attend the Bud Light fireworks, a concert sponsored by Skoal or Fleischmann's, or events sponsored by local banks, restaurants and radio stations. You could drink beer in pavilions built long ago by Miller, Pabst or Budweiser.
The Wisconsin fair also had over 700 commercial booths and displays. A "Smart Mop" demonstration was so effective that 500 were sold in a day at $19.99 apiece. Fairgoers tried out the "Kneading Fingers" pillow-sized massager, oohing and ahhing all the while, and bought 40 at $150 each.
IS the cost of promotion at fairs worth it to corporations? "The typical sponsor would be looking for 3.5 to 1 return on promotion dollars," says Richard Bjorklund, director of the Wisconsin fair. "I would be comfortable in saying that if you polled them you'd find they easily get that return and much more."
But in the end, "fairs are not a labor of money, they're a labor of love," Mr. Miller said, with much that's thrown in free. "We've historically had entertainment as part of the gate price, with stages going at all different times, for 141 years," said Norbert Bartoski, general manager of the California State Fair and Exposition in Sacramento.
The recession made things tougher. State governments nationwide cut subsidies to state-operated fairs. Many states mandated about four years ago that their fairs become self-sufficient.
That trend toward self-sufficiency has spurred public fair organizations into better use of their facilities year-round. At the New York State Fair, also called the Empire Expo Center, "we have several major exhibit buildings, a 50,000-seat grandstand where we have auto-racing, a 45,000-seat coliseum with a hockey program in the winter, and parking for 25,000 cars," Mr. LaGuardia said.
One constant hazard for a fair's budget is nature's bad moods. "Weather is the universal fear in the fair business," Mr. Bjorklund said. "We have a lot of eggs in one 11-day basket." Last summer, in fact, the worst storms in 40 years hit the Indiana State Fair's opening weekend.
Last year in Iowa, though, the floods that deluged the state stopped half a mile short of the fairgrounds. The state fair, which called itself "11 Days of Flood Relief," had record attendance of 893,000. "People were ready to come out after so many weeks of flooding and rain," said the manager, Marion Lucas.
 
'State' Is an Elusive Concept
 
THE term "state fair" refers to fairs and expositions run by nonprofit organizations in a variety of arrangements, says Lewis Miller, general manager of the International Association of Fairs and Expositions. Of the 50 largest fairs and expositions in the United States and Canada, many are indeed "state" fairs -- bona fide state agencies, publicly owned and operated. But many are private nonprofits, including No. 1, the State Fair of Texas, which dwarfs the rest with attendance of over 3.1 million.
No. 8 isn't a state but a county fair -- the Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona. It had 1.4 million fairgoers in 1993, half a million more than the Wisconsin State Fair. And No. 3 isn't even in this country -- 1.75 million people attended the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto last year, one of five Canadian fairs to make the top 50. Average attendence at the top 50 is between half a million and 1.5 million people, according to Amusement Business. The fairs generally run 10 to 17 days, mainly in August and September.
Fair revenue comes from four major areas: gate admissions, carnival rides, food and entertainment, with the fair normally receiving about a quarter to a third of the gross. Carnivals typically pay 25 to 40 percent of their grosses to the fair. Some fairs sell concert tickets for the bigger acts, with the fair retaining only 10 to 20 percent.
Per capita spending varies, but a survey for the New York State Fair outside Syracuse, for instance, found that the average person spent about $21.50. Multiply that by an attendance of 860,000 people over 12 days, and that comes to over $18.5 million.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE CUBANS;
Cuba Patrolling Beaches to Keep Children Off Unseaworthy Rafts

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Aug. 28

 BODY:
For the first time since thousands of Cubans began to flee the country by boat more than two weeks ago, President Fidel Castro's security forces were patrolling the beach today, warning departing Cubans not to take children aboard their rickety boats.
The order to keep children from risk came in a message from Mr. Castro published today in Juventud Rebelde, Cuba's only Sunday newspaper. 
 He said he would send border guards and internal police to patrol the beaches because "despite repeated warnings to people not to leave the country with children and adolescents aboard insecure boats, some people have continued to do so."
He said the guards would work on land to "persuade" people not to take children of high school age or younger on boats that were not seaworthy. If the would-be refugees persisted, the guards would use force if necessary, but they would not resort to using arms, the message said.
Mercedes Pichardo, 35, said today that she was approached on Cojimar beach by a guard in camouflage uniform carrying a pistol. "He told us that it was prohibited to take children, pregnant women or old people on our boat, and if we did we would get four years in prison," she said. She added that her children are 19, 15 and 10 and the younger two will stay behind with their grandmother.
"It is very dangerous for children, so we leave them at home, but people are going to go anyway," she said.
Mr. Castro's message also said the forces would patrol Cuban waters in search of those who chose to defy the warnings on land.
Cubans who live near the coast and others who have been camping out on the beaches preparing to flee said that, until today, no security forces had interfered with the surge of people making their way to the Florida Straits after Mr. Castro relaxed his measures to keep Cubans from fleeing and President Clinton tightened his policy on admitting Cuban refugees.
The patrols were not stopping every attempt to leave the island. Just before sunset five men carrying a raft on their shoulders walked toward the harbor in downtown Havana, near where anti-Castro protests on Aug. 5 set off the current exodus of refugees. As the men approached the shore, about 3,000 people poured out of their apartment buildings to cheer them on. Police officers appeared and demanded the credentials of foreign journalists, but did not interfere with the crowd. No arrests were made and in the confusion, the men pushed out to sea.
The mass migrations began after a speech by Mr. Castro after the protests, when he told Cubans that if they wanted to leave, he would not stop them. Cuba has allowed some people to travel outside the country, but every year some escape illegally by taking to the sea and evading the naval patrols in coastal waters.
Since the speech, the United States Coast Guard has reported picking up nearly 17,000 fleeing Cubans. No one knows exactly how many people have perished in the seas, but officials say children were certainly among them.
The new patrols arrived as word spread up and down the beaches and throughout Havana that President Clinton agreed on Saturday to talks with Cuba on immigration issues.
On the rocky beaches of Cojimar, where Cubans eager to put to sea were waiting for better weather, the news blared out of Raquel Perez Ruiz's house, where she had her radio tuned to Radio Marti for all to hear.
"I am so happy," said Mrs. Perez, who is 61 years old. "They should have talked a long time ago. There has already been so much Cuban blood shed."
The stormy weather that had kept people from fleeing this weekend did not improve, but some people waiting on the beaches said the news of the talks was one more reason to speed their departure, for fear that the political climate would change.
"They say that if they talk, Mr. Castro will close off the coast," said Mayoris Ramirez Ochoa, hurrying to gather up her meager belongings. "So everyone is talking of leaving today."
 
Negotiations Bring Hope
 For others, however, the idea of talks represented hope for Cuba. Perhaps now, they said, there was at least a wedge in the door that the United States long ago closed on relations with Cuba, a policy that many here believe has led to hardship. Perhaps now there would be no need to go.
"This is a disgrace, for people to be throwing themselves into the ocean in search of a better way of life," said Ana Rosa Hidalgo, 39, as she sat on a rubber inner tube on the beach.
"Both of them, Mr. Clinton and Fidel Castro, have the means to come up with a better immigration policy to avoid all these deaths.
"If I were there," said Mrs. Hidalgo, who worked as a guard on a military base, "I would ask Mr. Clinton why he is imposing this embargo on us. It is not hurting Castro's people but only the common people of Cuba."
News reports about the talks were sketchy in this country where the Government controls communication. Yet as the word spread, Cubans were debating whether the talks had come about as a result of strong leadership on Mr. Castro's part as his country faces its toughest economic challenge in three decades.
 
'A Good Plan' by Castro
 "It was a good plan on Castro's part if there is now going to be some dialogue," said Alberto Ruiz, Mrs. Perez's grandson, who is in the military. "If what I hear is true, the United States was not allowing as many Cubans to visit as they had visas to give."
He also said he hoped the talks would lead to negotiations on other matters, like the United States trade embargo against Cuba.
In Havana, Maria de la Caridad Cabrera, a day care worker, strolled down a Havana street with her granddaughter today, the Sunday before the start of the school year.
"All the people here are glad that the two sides are going to talk," she said.
 
Building Boats at Home
 At a garden restaurant, children celebrated a birthday. And at a restaurant that accepts only dollars, young Cubans in fashionable sports clothes munched on cheeseburgers and sipped TropiColas. At the same time, the sounds of construction were everywhere as people worked feverishly to build boats, some working in their front yards. Construction was underway in downtown Havana and for miles along the shore east of the city.
"Cuba is hungry," Mrs. Cabrera. "There is no food here. We don't have enough shoes or clothing for the young people." .
"Everyone would stay if there were enough food and clothing and medicine in Cuba," she said.
Mrs. Cabrera said the country is much worse off than before the revolution. But she said that this is partly a result of the damage done by the embargo. Mr. Castro, she said, has done his best.
"I am a Fidelista," she said. "We must have patience with him, because he will come through for us."
 
'A Circus, a Farce, a Disaster'
 But others were more bitter, compaining that Mr. Castro has led the country into severe food shortages, declining medical care and routine fuel shortages.
"What do you know, my love?" a man, who said his name was Rene, asked angrily. "Do you know what it's like to live under a dictatorship?"
"You outsiders come and you stay in your good hotels and you eat your food that most Cubans can't eat and you don't see that this is all a circus, a farce, a disaster," he said.
Rene, who works as a lineman for the Government electrical company, said the reason there is not more protest against Mr. Castro is that people are afraid to speak up.
"Remember that Mr. Castro is an intelligent man," he said. "He has created the most perfect system of repression in the world."

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: What Went Wrong? How the Health Care Campaign Collapsed -- A special report.;
For Health Care, Times Was A Killer

BYLINE: By Adam Clymer, Robert Pear and Robin Toner 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
This article was reported and written by Adam Clymer, Robert Pear and Robin Toner.
In March 1993, two months after his inauguration, President Clinton appealed to Robert C. Byrd, the presiding officer of the Senate, to let national health insurance legislation be considered as part of that summer's budget bill. 
 It was, at first glance, a move of remarkable hubris, a President elected with 43 percent of the vote expecting Congress to allow him to rearrange one-seventh of the American economy under the streamlined, fast-track procedures of a budget bill.
But it reflected the concern of the President and his allies that his power would never be greater than it was in his first months in office, that what was hard then would be supremely difficult a year later, and that a window was open, perhaps only fleetingly, to pass a major health care bill.
Senator Byrd, ever the parliamentarian, demurred -- the rules could not be bent, he said, that way and that far. And Mr. Clinton, before long, was distracted by economic struggles, the North American Free Trade Agreement, Whitewater and foreign crises, and the window began to close.
The Clinton health care plan became the captive of events, and politics, and an enormously complicated process headed by two figures making their debuts in national policy making -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, the impassioned First Lady, and Ira C. Magaziner, the cerebral policy guru and friend of Bill Clinton.
As the Administration and its Congressional allies take a brief vacation and try to gather strength for one last push on health care, some reflect on that moment in the spring of 1993 and see it as emblematic of lost time, lost opportunities, lost confidence.
There were many mistakes and misjudgments that surrounded the campaign to achieve universal coverage: The Administration assumed that a 43 percent electoral plurality was a mandate for a tremendously complicated overhaul of a system as sensitive as health care. It showed a continuing uncertainty about how to deal with Republicans, and an overly combative political approach. It even assumed that when the public said it favored fundamental change in health care that it meant the kind of change the policy analysts wanted.
But on all sides, from Clinton allies like John Rother of the American Association of Retired Persons to foes like John Motley of the National Federation of Independent Business, to sometime allies and sometime foes like Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, there is agreement on one thing: Delay was a fundamental error, the crucial stumbling block to passing legislation.
Consensus stops there. Even now there are disputes over whether some slight chance for a broad bill remains, or whether the realistic choice ahead is between slim change and none.
Though unfinished, the history of health care legislation is a striking measure of the complexity of legislating major change in an era of intense partisanship, with a public that distrusts Washington as never before, a campaign technology applied to whipping around voters' opinions, and news reports that emphasize conflict, not explanation.
The simplest measure of partisanship is that just one Republican in Congress, Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, ever backed Mr. Clinton's bill. In the House, moderates were told bluntly by Republican leaders not to offer amendments that might make legislation easier to pass.
Bob Blendon, a public opinion scholar at the Harvard School of Public Health, said of the Administration: "They misread the mandate, read it much too broadly. Since people are very cynical about government and the President only had 43 percent of the vote, they wanted reform, but they wanted something easy to understand, something that did not look as threatening as the Clinton plan. The Clinton White House read it as much too broad in terms of trust in President and Mrs. Clinton."
Whatever trust there was came under tremendous assault. Lobbyists for every conceivable interest that could be affected by any version of legislation swarmed over the Capitol. And to influence the public, more than $50 million was thrown into advertising, most by opponents and much of it simply false.
And newspapers and television failed to cut through the din and educate people, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania. Instead, they merely elevated public skepticism.
"Everything the press did appeared to engender cynicism," she said, citing a study that she and a colleague, Joseph N. Cappella, plan to present next Saturday to an American Political Science Association convention in New York. When the news emphasized controversy, she said, "That undermined the public sense that there was any agreement on what the problem is."
But only two or three years ago, it seemed there was a vast, historic consensus bubbling up from the grass roots, a hunger for sweeping change in the nation's health care system.
 
 
The Campaign
Did the Democrats Misread the Signs?
 Throughout the 1980's, business, labor, economists and a wide array of public policy analysts had grown increasingly alarmed over the rising costs and the expanding gaps in the health care system. But in the rough recessionary politics that brought the Democrats victory in 1991 and 1992, the issue became a populist crusade.
In 1991, the Democrat Harris Wofford won the bellwether Senate race in Pennsylvania with a promise of health care reform, signaling the power of the issue with an economically anxious middle class.
A year later, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska built his campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination around the promise of universal coverage. (Two years later, he was among the Senators arguing for an incremental approach.) Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, another candidate for the nomination, began talking in New Hampshire meeting halls about restructuring the health care marketplace.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas did not campaign on the issue as hard as some of his rivals did, but it fit neatly with his overarching campaign promise: to look after the forgotten middle class and use the Government to improve the economy and ease their lot. By the summer of 1992, Atul A. Gawande, a young Harvard medical student who had previously worked on health issues for Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, came on board the Clinton campaign. His task was to help flesh out Mr. Clinton's health plan and defend it from Republican attacks.
Mr. Clinton and his allies were trying hard to redefine the Democratic Party away from traditionally liberal approaches to domestic policy; they were almost inevitably drawn to the ideas of managed competition. Though still largely theoretical, the concept relies on market forces, not government, to hold down costs and expand access to health insurance. Mr. Gawande, now back in medical school, recalled on Saturday that in a series of meetings in the summer of 1992, "Clinton was very clear about his interest in managed competition and that he had no interest in a broad-based tax."
Vagueness is often a virtue in the politics of health care, and there were some who argued that Mr. Clinton should keep it vague. But by the end of the summer, he was being accused by the Bush campaign of being just another tax-and-spend, big-government Democrat when it came to health care in an eerie precursor of the Republican attacks to come.
"We had to repel it by saying here's the details of our plan," Mr. Gawande recalled. So the Clinton campaign prepared a major health care speech for the fall campaign.
Delivered in Rahway, N.J., at the offices of Merck & Company, the pharmaceutical giant, the speech committed Mr. Clinton to universal coverage, achieved by requiring employers to pay for their workers insurance.
This was enough for a Presidential campaign; Mr. Clinton enjoyed the benefits of being for health care reform without the downside of explaining how, exactly, it would be paid for, without the Congressional Budget Office passing judgment on his financing, without a fully engaged debate on all the contentious specifics of remaking the health care system. But without that debate, the Clinton forces may have made a dangerous miscalculation. They came away with a clear conviction that the public was sending a message in this campaign: do something big about health care.
But were they?
Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who also works for the Health Insurance Association of America, said on Saturday, "People overread the data in 1992. Almost half of Americans said they wanted a radical change in the health care system, but in Washington that was interpreted to mean something these people did not mean."
Mr. McInturff said that when he followed up in focus groups, asking people exactly what they meant by radical change, "they said: 'if I lose my job, I don't want to lose my coverage. I don't want it to cost so much.' "
The pollster added: "What they were really talking about was portability. So what in Washington was considered incremental change, was to people out in the country radical."
But to the first Democratic Administration in 12 years, and to its euphoric allies, remaking one-seventh of the American economy was just the kind of challenge they craved.
 
 
Early Days
From a Promise To Deep Secrecy
 In the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton had promised to guarantee health insurance for all Americans while cutting the Federal budget deficit in half within four years. In the transition from his election on Nov. 3, 1992, to his inauguration on Jan. 20, 1993, he received unwelcome news suggesting that those goals might be irreconcilable.
His transition team told him that it would be nearly impossible to expand health insurance coverage in his first term without big tax increases or Draconian controls on health costs. His advisers fought among themselves over whether deficit reduction or universal health insurance had higher priority.
At her confirmation hearing, Donna E. Shalala, then the nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, said that money saved through cuts in the growth of Medicare and Medicaid would be used to finance coverage for the uninsured, not to reduce the Federal budget deficit. In fact, Mr. Clinton and Congress decided that deficit reduction should come first.
Recalling the period between Election Day and Inauguration Day, Stuart H. Altman, an economist at Brandeis University who advised the President-elect, said this weekend: "During the transition, Clinton's total preoccupation was either with his economic program or putting his Cabinet together. Health care took a back seat. We got no guidance."
On Jan. 20, 1993, Americans heard the sparkling poetry of Maya Angelou, celebrating "the pulse of this new day." Five days later, the President appointed his wife to head a Task Force on National Health Care Reform with a clear mission: writing legislation "to be submitted to Congress within 100 days of our taking office," that is, by April 30.
 
'A Highly Formalized Process'
 It soon became clear that this was no ordinary process for developing policy. "We're in this big time," Secretary Shalala, a member of the task force, said in an interview on Jan. 25. She declared that the Administration would "corner the market" for health policy experts by recruiting the best ones to work in Washington.
Dr. Shalala was immediately upstaged by Mr. Magaziner, the coordinator of the task force, who designed the policy-making process with a zealous attention to detail and a deaf ear for politics and public relations. In his first public appearance, on Jan. 28, he told the Washington Business Group on Health that the 12-member task force would do its work through "a highly structured process, a highly formalized process."
The real work was done by the staff of the task force, which grew larger every week. Ultimately, with more than 500 people, the staff was bigger than 99 percent of all businesses in the United States. The staff was organized in 15 "cluster groups" studying such issues as cost controls, coverage, benefits, long-term care and ethical foundations of the new health care system.
To check on the progress of the cluster groups, to synthesize their work and to narrow the options, Mr. Magaziner scheduled a series of seven "tollgate" meetings from Feb. 10 to May 3. Confidential working papers from the task force show that "decisions on key issues" were to be made by the end of March, but the panel fell far behind schedule.
In an interview over the weekend, Mr. Gawande, the leader of one cluster group, recalled: "The tollgate meetings were open, free-for-all sessions. We sometimes went till 2 in the morning, and still felt that we were shortchanging each issue."
Mr. Gawande's recollections help explain why the proposals that emerged from the task force ran into a political buzzsaw.
"Politics was not a major part of our task," he said. "That was what the President and the First Lady and their political advisers were supposed to be dealing with. We were there to pull together options for them.
"The options were more difficult to narrow than people realized. The tradeoffs over who will pay and how generous the benefits should be, these are ultimately political decisions."
Health care experts in the Government and in private industry said, half in jest, that the task force was a huge seminar to educate Mr. Magaziner.
"Ira was the dominant player," Walter A. Zelman, a senior White House health policy adviser, said Saturday. "I never knew the extent to which the decisions he made were a result of conversations he had with others," like the President or Mrs. Clinton, "or whether he was making the decisions on his own."
Insiders say Mr. Magaziner and Mrs. Clinton reinforced each other's tendencies to seek idealistic solutions. They shared a perception that, as Mrs. Clinton said in May 1993, "too many people have made too much money" providing health care and insurance.
In an interview tonight, Mr. Magaziner defended his work. "The final decisions that we needed from the President in order to be able to finalize the policy were indefinitely postponed, and we didn't get them until after Labor Day because of the focus on the economic package," he said. "I don't think there was any choice. If the economic package did not get passed, the country would have been worse off."
Illustrating the problem, Mr. Magaziner said: "We set up our communications room at the end of May, and it was basically taken over by the economic team. We got it back at the end of August."
In hindsight, people who worked for the task force say its organization and secrecy planted the seeds of trouble for the President.
The policy experts developing proposals for universal coverage, a comprehensive package of health benefits and Federal subsidies for poor people, rarely spoke to the fiscal experts. The task force deferred the discussion of costs. Experts on mental health and long-term care argued for a richer and richer package of benefits without knowing how much it would cost.
 
Meeting, but Not Listening
 Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Magaziner met with many outside groups, but did not confide in them. After one such meeting, in March 1993, Dr. Quentin D. Young, chairman of Physicians for a National Health Program, which represents 6,000 doctors, said, "It was a magnificent exercise in pseudo openness."
In the crucial months from January to September 1993, Administration officials, especially Mr. Magaziner, alienated potential allies in Congress. Representative Pete Stark, a California Democrat who heads the Ways and Means subcommittee on health, said: "They came over and saw us all the time, but ignored what we said."
Some lawmakers had urged the President to submit only a statement of principles; others wanted details. In the absence of a detailed proposal from the White House, Mr. Stark said, "we were paralyzed."
Last month, long after the task force went out of business, the Clinton Administration was still defending the secrecy of its operations in Federal District Court here. In retrospect, Mr. Zelman said, "it probably wasn't worth the secrecy."
 
The Strategy
Planning Falters As Crises Appear
 Last Sept. 22, President Clinton went before a joint session of Congress. Overcoming a malfunctioning Teleprompter, he gave a compelling speech.
"Tonight we come together to write a new chapter in the American story," he declared. "This health care system is badly broken and we need to fix it.
"At long last, after decades of false starts, we must make this our most urgent priority: giving every American health security, health care that can never be taken away, health care that is always there."
The speech, and the succeeding weeks, had been planned like a long political campaign. There were interviews with television anchors and newspaper columnists by the President and the First Lady, "Health Care That is Always There" buttons, different "messages" for different weeks and an immense commitment of Presidential time -- a promise of five weeks on this issue.
At first the signs seemed favorable. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, offered hope for bipartisanship and played host to Mrs. Clinton. Senator Chafee, with 23 Republican co-sponsors for a different approach to universal coverage, requiring individuals to insure themselves, basked in her tributes.
And Mrs. Clinton captivated and dominated her audience when she testified before five Congressional committees starting on Sept. 28, recalling heart-rending stories of health care problems, praising members of Congress for their insight and deflecting the rare episodes of hostility. The Clinton program had been smoothly launched.
But, like a new battleship that slides down the ways, it still wasn't ready for action. The bill itself was not ready to be introduced until Oct. 27. Lloyd Bentsen, the Secretary of the Treasury, refused to testify on Capitol Hill before he was surer of the numbers. Four days before the President's speech, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, foreshadowed the obstacles he would present later when he called the Administration's numbers "fantasy."
Dubious about the Clinton proposal or even whether there was a health care crisis, Mr. Moynihan would emerge from time to time. His hearings were a fascinating intellectual excursion into health care and related issues, but it was late June before he was ready to write legislation.
 
The Big Delay
 But the most immediate problem was not in Washington, or even in the United States. On Oct. 3, 12 American soldiers on a peacekeeping operation in Somalia were killed and scores were wounded or missing in an exchange with a Somali faction. Americans were horrified to see pictures of a dead soldier dragged through the streets of Mogadishu.
The President turned back from a health care trip to California and turned his focus abroad. Other foreign policy problems erupted in Haiti and Bosnia, the North American Free Trade Agreement was in trouble, and it was December before Mr. Clinton was again heavily focused on health care.
Mr. McInturff, who was polling for the already hostile Health Insurance Association of America, said this weekend: "We were doing daily tracking from Sept. 22 on, and awareness of his plan was going up. Support for the plan was going up." But on Oct. 3, Mr. McInturff said, it stopped.
Administration officials see that diversion as critical to the selling campaign. But the dream of five weeks of uninterrupted Presidential time was just another unrealistic hope, another imperfect translation from the campaign mode to governing.
Moreover, the Administration's likely allies were not out cheering. They expressed only qualified approval, or said they had to wait. It was in this period that Washington first began to notice the insurance association's television commercials of a couple named "Harry and Louise" who voiced doubts about the details of the Clinton program, starting with requiring people and employers to join health insurance purchasing alliances. The audience was never national, and Professor Jamieson of the University of Pennsylvania has cast some doubt on the ads' effectiveness, but they rubbed a nerve here.
 
Shifting Focus
 In a campaign posture, the Clinton Administration resisted inquiries about how the alliances would work. Instead it wanted to talk about what it called the six principles of the President's program: "security, simplicity and savings; choice, quality and responsibility." In Mr. Clinton's Sept. 22 speech, it had taken longest to explain "simplicity."
For all the talk of conducting this effort like a campaign, which put Republicans on their guard about the depth of the commitment to cooperation, there was often only feeble follow-through. In September, Mrs. Clinton promised Congressional leaders that the Administration or the Democratic National Committee would find small businessmen in every Congressional district who supported required payments by employers. It was months before that effort was even begun, after the other side's argument was firmly planted.
 
The Lobbyists
Strong Foes, Uneasy Allies
 In the beginning, almost nobody wanted to be cast as an opponent of health care restructuring. But by the end of 1993, when the vague promise of a health care overhaul had been turned into the 1,342 pages of the Clinton plan, it was difficult to find out-and-out supporters of the President's proposal.
In February of this year, the Business Roundtable, representing about 200 of the nation's largest companies, rebuffed the Clintons and threw its support to a more modest rival plan. This was devastating to the Administration, which had counted on such companies to offset the opposition of the small-business lobby.
"You are not going to reform one-seventh of the American economy without business support and Republican support," Tom Downey, a former Congressman who is now a lobbyist, said in an interview this weekend.
Many advocates of health care restructuring were perplexed by the position taken by big business. After all, they had reasoned, big corporations generally paid for their workers' insurance -- and what they paid also subsidized health care for millions of people who were uninsured. For years, business executives had complained about the soaring cost of health care.
But many corporate executives had a visceral reaction to the complexity of the Clinton plan and the expansion of Federal authority that Mr. Clinton was proposing. They said they could control costs much better than the Government could, and they feared that under the Clinton plan they would lose the right to tailor health benefits to their employees' needs.
 
Small Business to the Fore
 With big business sidelined, the National Federation of Independent Business had a clear field. Mr. Motley, chief lobbyist for the 600,000-member federation, said his organization made two early strategic decisions about how to block Mr. Clinton's proposal to require employers to help buy health insurance for their workers.
First, the federation decided that the best way to fight the "employer mandate" was not to seek public sympathy for small business, but to play on public fears that jobs would be lost if employers had to absorb added insurance costs. Second, it concluded that the campaign would be won or lost out in the country, not in Washington.
"We did everything we possibly could do from a grass-roots standpoint," Mr. Motley said.
The Administration's biggest tormentor, after small-business lobbyists, was probably the Health Insurance Association of America, which began running television advertisements ridiculing the Clinton plan in September 1993. The "Harry and Louise" commercials featured a couple agonizing over details of the Clinton plan in exchanges like this one:
Louise: This plan forces us to buy our insurance through these new mandatory Government health alliances.
Harry: Run by tens of thousands of new bureaucrats.
Louise: Another billion-dollar bureaucracy.
Professor Jamieson of the University of Pennsylvania said the available evidence suggests that "the ads had a negligible impact on the public" and were intended primarily to influence opinion makers in Washington and New York. But Mr. McInturff, the pollster who analyzed the commercials for the insurance industry, says they did influence the public.
In any event, the Clintons' criticism of of the advertisementsprovoked far more public interest in them than Harry and Louise would ever have commanded on their own.
The supporters of Clinton-style health care legislation proved no match for the groups opposing Mr. Clinton. Citizen Action, a consumer group, says that political action committees formed by insurance companies, doctors, hospitals, drug companies and others in the health care industry contributed more $26 million to members of Congress from January 1993 to last May.
The core of support for universal health insurance was a broad coalition known as the Health Care Reform Project, founded in September 1993 by groups like the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Catholic Health Association and the American Association of Retired Persons.
These groups staunchly supported the principles and goals of Mr. Clinton's plan, but expressed varying degrees of enthusiasm for its details. Many groups, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said they supported both the Clinton plan and proposals for a Canadian-style "single payer" system of national health insurance financed by the Government. Those two proposals are very different and, in many ways, contradictory.
Moreover, Mr. Clinton's allies continually qualified their support by expressing concern about specific parts of his plan. Labor unions worried that Mr. Clinton was going to tax some of the benefits they had won in collective bargaining. Doctors specializing in internal medicine supported much of Mr. Clinton's plan, but objected to the proposed cutbacks in Medicare and to the idea of Federal limits on private health insurance premiums.
In view of these reservations, Mrs. Clinton said, the Administration's allies, the proponents of universal coverage, "cannot possibly have the intensity that the negative forces have."
 
 
The Committees
An Issue Is Lost In the Labyrinth
 In his State of the Union Message on Jan. 25, 1994, President Clinton waved a pen before Congress and threatened to veto any health legislation that did not guarantee insurance coverage for all Americans.
By then, health care reform had made its way from a vague buzzword on the campaign trail to a scholarly treatise to a sprawling piece of legislation scattered over five major Congressional committees. It was in those committees that the most byzantine stage of the health care struggle began, a stage that lasted until the Fourth of July weekend -- long past all the self-imposed deadlines, long past the time when anyone expected a grand health care compromise to emerge.
The struggle for universal coverage began to collapse in the committees. Again and again, members tried to reach consensus on how to cover everybody without antagonizing the small-business lobby. But they always ran up against the same problem: without an employer mandate or a broad-based tax increase, how could they pay for it?
 
'You Can't Go That Way'
 Robert D. Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, was usually the man who delivered the bad news -- to committees, to rump groups, to the ad hoc gatherings that wrestled one after another with the same insoluble issues.
"Each individual group would think they'd discovered a new route to China," said Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, in an interview this weekend. "And they'd go down to Bob Reischauer, and he'd say, 'No, boys, you can't go that way. It's all ice up there.' "
Most of the committee leaders tried hard to muscle a bill through. Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, offered one compromise after another. But his committee deadlocked.
Mr. Motley of the National Federation of Independent Business said that Energy and Commerce was ripe for his lobbying -- heavy with members from rural states that are dependent on small business. "We can reach out and touch them a lot easier," Mr. Motley said. "States like Kansas are set up perfectly to maximize the impact of business owners."
Representative Cooper, who had his own health care plan that relied on market forces to expand coverage instead of a mandate, said on Saturday that the issue may have been destined to stall in the committees.
"I think you had committee chairmen who were for the Canadian health care system, who were to the left of Clinton," he said. "And you had the average House member who was way to the right of Clinton, and the President's proposal -- the Ira Magaziner proposal -- satisfied no one."
The two most liberal of the five committees -- Education and Labor in the House, Labor and Human Resources in the Senate -- reported out versions of the Clinton plan. But despite a quarter-century of determined advocacy by Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, chairman of Labor and Human Resources, nobody expected those committees to produce the vehicles for floor debate. The committee that most prides itself on this kind of heavy lifting, the House Ways and Means Committee, was hindered by the loss of its chairman, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, who gave up the chair when he was indicted in May on corruption charges.
"He is the strongest member of the House of Representatives in terms of driving a consensus," Mr. McDermott said. "I don't think it would have been a consensus I would have liked every piece of, but there would have been a consensus reached that would have been ready for the floor."
Ways and Means soldiered on under the acting chairman, Sam M. Gibbons of Florida, producing a bill that attained the necessary 20 Democratic votes on the committee to keep the process going. But by that point, the Republicans were essentially opting out of the process and Democrats were beginning to wonder where it was headed.
In the Senate Finance Committee, another place where a grand compromise might have emerged, there was instead weeks of false starts and jabs at the Administration from Senator Moynihan, the committee chairman.
Health care, of course, was the kind of issue that the committee system was intended for, demanding great expertise, months of close-in work. But in the end, it seemed to overwhelm the lawmakers.
"This issue got away from everybody," said Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, a member of the Ways and Means Committee. "It got away from all of us. And I don't think anybody anticipated the amount of resources that would be marshaled against it."

The Mitchell Plan Runs Into a Snag
 Universal coverage was undergoing redefinition when Congress came back to work on July 11. The 95 percent figure was in the air, and soon it was to be in the bill the Administration supported, the plan put forward on Aug. 2 by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader.
His plan was to use subsidies for the working poor, and especially their children, to push coverage rates up. But if it did not rise to 95 percent, from the current 85 percent, by the year 2000, a fall-back plan would go into effect, requiring employers to pay half the cost of their workers' premiums unless Congress found a better way.
Mr. Mitchell assembled the bill from the work of the Senate Finance Committee and Labor and Human Resources Committee, as well as from his own ever-shrinking idea of what would pass. But his narrowed hopes of what the Senate might adopt alarmed House Democrats.
Three days earlier, their leaders proposed a bill requiring employers to start paying 80 percent of workers' premiums, beginning in 1997, and expanding Medicare to cover the unemployed and others without a paycheck in the household. But with Mr. Mitchell apparently retreating, House Democrats were even more reluctant to go out on a limb and take the political risks in voting for something the Senate might undo.
The Senate started debating the bill on Aug. 9, and Mr. Mitchell promised six-day-a-week sessions until it was finished. But in two five-day weeks, Republican stalling tactics prevented any important votes. The majority leader was not sure he had the votes, but the opposition was not sure he did not.
Senator Dole and Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, both 1996 Presidential hopefuls, led the attack. Mr. Gramm's zeal in proclaiming Mr. Clinton's hopes "a dead body," was predictable, but Mr. Dole's partisan antagonism was not, for he had worked closely with Senator Chafee in drafting his universal coverage bill. Now he was opposing any taxes and offering slim subsidies, and insisting that the President move in his direction.
Nor was that the only distraction Mr. Clinton's allies faced. Senator Chafee was now leading a bipartisan band of about 20 senators that called itself the "mainstream coalition." It proposed more coverage than the Dole bill and more deficit reduction than the Mitchell bill. Some members of the coalition insisted that it had to be their plan or nothing; others were more willing to bargain.
But Mr. Mitchell had no time for bargaining as the bitter partisanship of the House debate on crime legislation sloshed over to the Senate last week, and he had a four-day fight to pass what is normally a politician's dream, a $30.2 billion anti-crime bill in an election year.
The crime bill dispute complicated health care efforts in the House, too. Representative Cardin, the Maryland Democrat, said on Saturday that if the dispute "had been off the screen, I think we would have had a chance" to start assembling votes.
But between that problem and waiting for the Congressional Budget Office to analyze the leadership bill and rival approaches, the House never even took up the health care measure, which it had first planned to finish by Aug. 12, and then by Aug. 19.
Finally, hoping that a cooling-off period might help, Mr. Mitchell sent the Senate home last Thursday night, insisting he would be earnestly negotiating with the mainstream group for two weeks and promising that the Senate would go back to the health care debate on Sept. 12.
 
Two Degrees of Optimism
 Mr. Chafee expressed optimism this morning, but he conceded that if anything passed it would not provide universal coverage -- "not if by 'universal' you mean 100 percent or 95 percent."
Mr. Mitchell, who is retiring from the Senate this year and who passed up a Supreme Court seat to achieve a last legislative triumph in health care, took a longer view. "I really believe that we will get this done, if not all this year, in time, if for no other reason than it is so necessary," he said in an interview on Friday. "Democracies tend to respond to crises afterwards more so than before them."
To Mr. Chafee, the hope for insuring another 15 million or so Americans and making other changes in health insurance practices that were once scorned as "incremental" rests on the willingness of the President and his allies "to abandon 'mammoth steps' and recognize that "we had better be cautious."
There is general agreement that Mr. Clinton would have got closer to his goal if he had acted faster, before the opposition had mobilized and his own standing had weakened. But beyond that, even perfect hindsight produces no consensus on what could have been done to bring the nation closer to the universal health care it seemed to want 11 months ago.
Dr. Drew Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and an advocate of universal insurance, said on Saturday: "You were always dealing with a fundamental underlying dynamic: the American people want change as long as it doesn't cost them too much or affect them too much personally. The problem wasn't Harry and Louise. The problem was us."

The Garden Sale
 Viacom agreed to sell its Madison Square Garden sports and entertainment empire to a partnership of Cablevision Systems and ITT, but many analysts said the purchase price of $1.075 billion in cash would far exceed what the Garden properties -- including the New York Knicks, New York Rangers and MSG cable network -- are actually worth.

HEADLINE: Bosnian Serbs Cast Ballots on Peace Plan

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Bosnian Serbs voting in a referendum today appeared certain to confirm their rejection of an international peace plan for Bosnia that their leadership has portrayed as a recipe for military defeat and economic ruin.
Diplomats and United Nations officials said that a relentless campaign by the Bosnian Serb news media seemed to have assured an overwhelming defeat for the plan. The proposal, drawn up by the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, would require the Serbs to give up about a third of the territory they hold in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
 The first results from the referendum are expected within 48 hours of the closing of 82 polling stations where Serbs cast ballots on the second and last day in the territory they control. Although organizers of the vote said almost a million people had cast ballots, international observers argue that the population of the Serb-held areas -- about 70 percent of the former Yugoslav republic's land -- has fallen to about 700,000 at most.
President Clinton has warned that if the Serbs persist until Oct. 15 in their rejection of the plan, he will ask the United Nations Security Council to lift the arms embargo on the mainly Muslim Bosnian forces so they can fight the Serbs more effectively.
But Britain and France, which have troops in the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia, argue that peacekeeping and ending the arms embargo are incompatible. Military analysts fear that if the peacekeeping force withdrew, the better- armed and better-organized Serbs could defeat the Government forces.
As the voting was held today, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia arrived here for talks with Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, over the recent rift between the Bosnian Serbs and their patrons in Belgrade.
Because the landlocked Bosnian Serbs have been dependent on financial and logistical support from Belgrade throughout 28 months of war, there were signs of a potential breakthrough this month when Serbia cut off road and telephone communications with the Bosnian Serbs because their leaders rejected the peace plan.
Western diplomats said Mr. Kozyrev would offer a mild easing of an international trade embargo against Serbia, including the possibility of opening the airport and readmitting Serbia to world sporting events, if Mr. Milosevic agreed to effective international policing of the border between Serbia and Bosnia. "We are no longer talking about toughening or imposing extra sanctions on Belgrade," Mr. Kozyrev said. "The task is the opposite: to lift certain sanctions to show clearly to the Serbs that every step in the right direction by Belgrade will be met by a corresponding, positive reaction from the side of the world community."
His statement underscored the sharp turnabout by the five-nation group that drew up the latest peace plan, which would allocate 51 percent of Bosnia to the Muslim-led Government and 49 percent to the Serbs. Rejection of the plan by the Bosnian Serbs was supposed to lead to tighter sanctions on Serbia, as well as increased world military pressure on the Serbs in Bosnia.
Instead, a new policy of squeezing the Bosnian Serbs by using an unlikely ally -- Mr. Milosevic -- appears to have been adopted while an easing of sanctions against Belgrade is under intense review.
His country is economically and psychologically exhausted by more than two years of a debilitating embargo, and another winter of isolation would be difficult to endure. Moreover, officials close to the Serbian President say he is convinced the peace plan can be used as a first step toward resolving the central problem posed by Yugoslavia's disintegration: substantial Serbian minorities in Bosnia and Croatia.
 
A Difference of Outlook
 But while Mr. Milosevic's stand against Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, now seems serious, it is by no means clear that the Serbian President will accept the political embarrassment of allowing international observers on Serbia's border with Bosnia or that he can restrain the Bosnian Serbs.
The Serbs of Serbia and the Serbs of Bosnia have different histories, the former having freed themselves from the rule of the Ottoman Turks much earlier, and their differing sensibilities have now been strained by more than two years of fighting in Bosnia. A life-or-death conflict for the Bosnian Serbs has become a dreary, somewhat distant and increasingly meaningless war for many of the people in Serbia.
The Bosnian Serb army has become more self-reliant and is now highly organized and well equipped. Over time, the Bosnian Serbs argue, the long border between Serbia and Serb-held parts of Bosnia is certain to become porous once again.

HEADLINE: THE GARDEN SALE: THE PROGRAMMING;
Cablevision's Craving for Sports

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

 BODY:
Although he is nowhere near as famous -- or as noisy -- as cable television impresarios like Ted Turner, there is little mystery about why Charles F. Dolan was so intent on acquiring Madison Square Garden.
As the chairman and chief executive of the Cablevision Systems Corporation, the nation's fourth-largest cable operator, Mr. Dolan has made sports programming -- particularly of New York sports -- a central pillar of his company's growth for nearly three decades. 
 The deal would give Cablevision sweeping control over sports in the local market. The company not only would own the New York Knicks and New York Rangers, but would also still be televising the New York Mets, New York Islanders, New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils on Cablevision's Sportchannel cable network and the Knicks, Rangers and New York Yankees on the MSG Network.
Indeed, so sweeping would that control be that the New York State Attorney General, G. Oliver Koppell, plans to open an antitrust investigation.
"Until now, you have had two cable stations that vigorously competed to carry New York sports teams," Mr. Koppell said in an interview yesterday. "After this acquisition, you'll have only one, and you'll have essentially no competition. You will also have no competition for viewers. The viewers will not have a choice."
At a news conference yesterday announcing the deal, Mr. Dolan said: "The advice we have is that we are in good shape on antitrust. The way we are doing it is making the games available to a maximum audience. The object is to give the games maximum circulation and to have them be presented in ways appropriate to specific interests of the public."
Based in Woodbury, L.I., Cablevision has 2.5 million subscribers in 19 states. But 1.4 million of those subscribers are concentrated in and around the New York metropolitan area, with most of the rest clustered around Boston, Cleveland, Chicago and a few other cities.
Largely because Cablevision's systems are grouped tightly together around common television markets, Mr. Dolan was a cable industry pioneer in signing up sports teams like the Knicks and Rangers. (He subsequently sold rights to those two teams, which he would regain as part of the deal announced yesterday.)
For Cablevision over the years, the formula has been both simple and successful: build or buy systems that together make up a big market, achieve economies of scale that allow the systems to sign crowd-pleasing local sports teams, and then attract subscriber revenues that make it possible to finance more growth.
Cablevision now owns eight regional sports networks, including Sportschannel New York, and it operates two national sports services -- Prime Network and Newsport -- in partnership with the Liberty Media Corporation, a part of Tele-Communications Inc.
Though hardly operating on the scale of John C. Malone, the powerful chief executive of Tele-Communications in Denver, Mr. Dolan has quietly but consistently been quick to seize on new technology and new ideas.
In 1961, when cable television was still in its paleolithic era, he started by delivering multiple-channel programming to hotels in Manhattan. Four years later, he built a fledgling cable network for residential customers and soon became the first person in the cable industry to strike deals with professional sports teams.
In 1967, he reached an agreement to carry the Knicks and Rangers on cable in New York and developed what is now Sportschannel New York. In 1978, he was the first cable operator to strike a deal with Major League Baseball, winning rights to carry the Yankees and the Mets.
Mr. Dolan sold his Manhattan system to Time Inc. in 1973, in exchange for several systems on Long Island. Those systems formed the nucleus for what is now Cablevision Systems.
In addition to expanding his cable systems, Mr. Dolan also started Home Box Office, the movie channel, which is now also owned by Time Warner Inc. Cablevision, through its subsidiary Rainbow Program Holdings, currently owns another movie channel, American Movie Classics, as well as a cultural channel, Bravo, and a 24-hour local news channel called News 12 Long Island.
 
Tripping on the Triplecast
 There have been some mistakes. The biggest was the Triplecast, Cablevision's joint venture with NBC to offer the 1992 Olympics on pay-per-view television. Under that plan, viewers would get three channels of full-time Olympics coverage. But the project failed to get much interest, and Cablevision lost about $50 million on it.
Cablevision's Sportschannel lost rights to Yankee baseball in 1988, when the MSG Network won a bidding battle. Many financial analysts criticized MSG at the time, saying it had overpaid with its $486 million deal for rights to Yankee games through the year 2000. Now those rights are Cablevision's to make or lose money on.
The company's core business has been sound, though the company has accumulated $10 billion of debt over the years to finance its growth. Last year, Cablevision reported a net loss of $57 million on revenue of $666 million. But its operating cash flow -- earnings before depreciation, amortization and interest -- was $252 million. In the cable industry, cash flow is considered a better measure of strength than profits or losses.
 
A Merger Candidate
 Last year, when the telephone and cable television industries were caught in a frenzy of merger talks, Cablevision Systems was one of the most-sought-after companies. U S West Inc., the regional Bell company based in Denver, and Time Warner were believed to have been active suitors, as well as the Southwestern Bell Corporation. Shortly after the Bell Atlantic Corporation shook the industry with an agreement to buy Tele-Communications, many industry experts predicted that Cablevision would be sold to a Bell company within a few weeks or months.
That never happened, however. Investment bankers say Mr. Dolan held out for a high price. And after the Bell Atlantic deal collapsed in February, the merger mania subsided quickly.
Now it is Mr. Dolan on the acquiring side, in a deal that -- if it goes through -- suddenly makes him the most powerful sports programmer in the nation's largest television sports market.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: U.S. POLICY;
U.S. Promises to Respond If Castro Offers Reforms

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Seeking to defuse the refugee crisis with Cuba, the Clinton Administration offered some carrots to Fidel Castro today to encourage him to undertake democratic reforms.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that if Mr. Castro took meaningful steps like allowing free elections, the Administration would respond in a positive way. 
 "If he moves toward democracy in a tangible, significant way, we'll respond in a carefully calibrated way," Mr. Christopher said on the CBS News program "Face the Nation."
Mr. Christopher declined to say what these responses might be. But after he spoke, several State Department officials said the Administration might ease -- but not eliminate -- economic or travel restrictions against Cuba if Mr. Castro allowed more freedom of expression or free elections.
 
Not Seeking Castro's Ouster
 In what several officials said was an effort to reduce the rancor of the exchanges between Washington and Havana, Mr. Christopher also said the United States was not specifically seeking Mr. Castro's departure.
"What we seek is peaceful, democratic change," he said. "That's our goal. Whether that involves Mr. Castro or not is really up to him."
Although many Republicans and Cuban-American groups are urging President Clinton to demand Mr. Castro's departure, several Administration officials said it would be unwise to demand his ouster because that could cause the Cuban leader to take a vindictive approach to the refugee crisis and other matters.
Mr. Christopher, who cut his California vacation short last week to deal with the Cuba crisis, sought to portray the Administration's policy as a reasonable, middle course between what he described as two extremes -- those seeking warlike measures and those willing to scrap the trade embargo.
He said the Administration was not contemplating a naval blockade, stating that "it can lead toward confrontation; it's an act of war." Those who advocate a blockade, like some Cuban-American groups, are advocating "extreme positions," he said.
Last Sunday, Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, suggested that the Administration might look at a blockade as a way of stepping up pressure on Havana.
Mr. Christopher denied that the Administration's policy was being driven by domestic politics, even though Florida officials, Cuban-American groups and some Administration officials have said Mr. Clinton's decision to tighten sanctions against Havana was a response to Cuban-American pressures.
In television appearances today, Mr. Christopher and other officials sought to put to rest skepticism that the Administration would discuss subjects other than immigration at the talks scheduled later this week with Cuban officials.
The United States and Cuba agreed to limited talks on immigration after Mr. Clinton rejected Mr. Castro's call last week for high-level talks on a range of subjects, including the trade embargo.
"Migration is at the core of what we have to talk to Cuba about," Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press." "We're not going to negotiate broader questions."
Mr. Tarnoff said the United States was not interested "in cutting a deal" with the Cuban leader. "What we want him to understand is that he has to deal with the Cuban people," he said. "The United States is not an intermediary between Castro and his people."
 
Isolate Castro, Floridian Says
 Also appearing on "Face the Nation," Senator Connie Mack, a Florida Republican, agreed that the Administration should not engage in broad negotiations with Mr. Castro. "It would be like throwing him a lifeline," he said. "It's not what we should be doing. We should be attempting to further isolate this man."
Mr. Mack said the Administration should consider blockading Cuba if Mr. Castro continued to let Cubans flee to the United States.
On the same program, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said "I can't think of anything more foolish" than a blockade, asserting that it would isolate the United States.
Mr. Dodd, chairman of the Senate's Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, backed the idea of broad negotiations. "No one wants to see this Government perpetuated," he said. "But to suggest somehow that we're just going to allow this situation to persist without trying to find some common ground or resolve these issues diplomatically and politically seems awfully naive and awfully myopic."
Administration officials said they were encouraged by a report in the Cuban Government newspaper Juventud Rebelde that Mr. Castro would prohibit children and adolescents from leaving Cuba on unsafe rafts and boats.
"We are interested in safe, legal and orderly migration, and that's what we want to encourage," Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said in an interview. "If Cuba wants to discourage emigration that is illegal and dangerous for Cuban citizens, we think that makes sense."

HEADLINE: U.S. Puts Off Any Decision On Haiti Issue

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's plans for a possible invasion of Haiti have been put on a slower track by the Cuban refugee crisis and a myriad of diplomatic doubts and problems. But the preparations for a showdown with Haiti's military rulers continue, senior Administration officials say.
An invasion to restore the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, would not take place until after the Cuban crisis is resolved and perhaps not until after the November elections in the United States, some Administration officials say. 
 While the delays have raised some concerns in the Pentagon about readiness, in a larger sense no one in the Government seems to mind. The Administration hopes that the threat of an invasion makes the reality unnecessary. In that light, keeping the wheels of preparation moving, however slowly, has taken on a special importance.
 
'No Timetable Has Been Set'
 "No one ought to assume that there's been any decline in the urgency of dealing with the situation," said Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff. "No timetable has been set, but I can assure you that we are moving to increase the pressure."
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch are to attend a meeting of Caribbean defense and foreign ministers in Kingston, Jamaica, on Tuesday, where the ministers are expected to support an invasion of Haiti.
At least five countries, including Barbados, Jamaica and Belize, are expected to contribute a total of about 200 troops to the 15,000-member, largely American invasion force. The Caribbean troops would not be in the first wave, State Department officials say.
American assurances aside, members of Father Aristide's government-in-exile express deep concerns that time is slipping away and that the position of the Haitian rulers is growing stronger.
 
'Not So Serious'
 "We have not been walking forward toward a solution and we are impatient that things are standing still," Claudette Werleigh, Father Aristide's Foreign Minister, said in a telephone interview. "The military in power is hearing a message that they have more time and they shouldn't worry. They really believe the international community and the U.S. are not so serious or so eager to intervene as the message seems to be sent and to be received."
There are many signs of this go-slow approach, which Administration officials acknowledge but attribute more to summer vacations and diplomatic snarls than to lack of interest.
A mid-level United Nations envoy, Rolf Knuttson, is in the Dominican Republic now to arrange a meeting between senior United Nations officials and the Haitian junta, but no one is certain if the generals or their aides will even meet with Mr. Knuttson. "If a senior-level meeting happens it will be to persuade the military to step down," said Ahmad Fawzi, a United Nations spokesman. "We may offer them a boat or a bike or a plane to leave, but there will be no negotiations."
 
Giving Sanctions a Chance
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have argued for giving sanctions as much time to work as possible. But an 88-member international observer force that is supposed to monitor the enforcement of sanctions along the porous border with the Dominican Republic has been mired in bureaucratic wrangling, and is still days away from setting up.
American and Canadian observers say they are ready to go, but Argentine troops are still waiting for approval from the Dominican Government.
Sanctions have had an overall "wrecking" effect on the already weak Haitian economy, a State Department official said. Since July 1, inflation has sapped the value of the Haitian currency, the gourde, by 58 percent, the official said, and gasoline is selling at about $9 a gallon, its highest levels since January.
But the wealthy elites and military rulers still seem largely insulated from this pressure. The Cuban crisis has led the Navy to reduce the number of ships enforcing the trade embargo from 10 to 6, including two foreign vessels, allowing the elites to rebuild their smuggling networks.
 
Questions of Readiness
 Pentagon officials worry that the delay is complicating questions of military readiness. Two Navy warships, the Wasp and the Nashville, with 1,800 marines, are steaming off Port-au-Prince. "At some time soon, we won't be as ready, and we'll have to gear up training again," said a senior Pentagon general. "It's getting close to that now. We'd have to go back into a honing phase."
But a delay will also give the United Nations more time to win commitments from other nations to join a peacekeeping force that would follow up an invasion. The United Nations has approached more than 40 countries, but only 10 have committed to send about 2,000 of the 6,000 militia and police that would be part of United Nations-directed "second phase."
And it could extend the chances that a carrot-and-stick approach of tough sanctions and inducements to depart might persuade the junta that seized power in 1991 to step down. "If in the next two weeks there's evidence that an envoy mission can be the fig leaf the military needs, that will change the urgency to get a multinational coalition," said a senior American official.
Indeed, the urgency to use military force will remain low if the flow of Haitian refugees stays a trickle and the harassment of foreigners "stays off the front pages," said the American official.
Invading Haiti before resolving the Cuban crisis poses huge risks. While some Administration officials argue it would send Fidel Castro a strong message, other experts say it would only inflame tensions.

HEADLINE: Whitman Starts Four-State Campaign for G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman held more than her share of the spotlight this weekend as she began her first major political tour outside New Jersey. While she was preparing to try to boost the campaigns of Republican candidates in four states, she heard herself being praised as a possible Vice Presidential candidate on the Republican ticket in 1996.
Mrs. Whitman's tour was intended to offer testimony that cutting taxes and reducing the size of government were good politics as well as good business. She added that she wanted to see Republicans pick up the seven seats needed to take control of the United States Senate, a change she said would protect states like New Jersey from expensive Federal mandates. 
 But she did not close the door on speculation about a spot on the next national Republican ticket, saying only that such talk was premature.
"I'm a new governor," she said, during a news conference at a small women-owned business in the heart of this city's downtown area. "I've only had the job for eight months and it's a little early to say something as dramatic as that."
 
'She Has Lots of Potential'
 At her first stop, to support the United States Senate campaign of John Ashcroft, former Missouri Governor, the press release prepared by the Ashcroft campaign said he was being endorsed by "a potential V.P. nominee." Doreen Torgerson, communications director for the Ashcroft campaign, said the description was her idea and not that of Mrs. Whitman's staff.
Both Mr. Ashcroft and Senator Christopher Bond of Missouri pointed to Mrs. Whitman's efforts in New Jersey as a model for the type of fiscal policy they favor.
Senator Bond, who has known Mrs. Whitman since 1960 when he attended Princeton University with her brother, Webster B. Todd Jr., met the Governor at the airport and said her visit was significant. "She's a Republican governor, a woman governor and she has lots of potential," he said. "She's doing a good job in New Jersey and is being watched closely by national party leaders."
Mr. Bond revealed another reason for his invitation to Mrs. Whitman: He needed fresh faces for his series of summer barbecues. "You have no idea how tough it is to attract some media attention in St. Louis on a Saturday," he said.
The cocktail reception and barbecue was held at a private home in Ladue, an affluent St. Louis suburb. Pat Fusselman, executive director of the Missouri Republican Party, said the 100 guests contributed about $40,000 to the state party.
 
Reviving Rollins Dispute
 While the Missouri stop appeared to go smoothly, Mrs. Whitman faced controversy in Texas, the second leg of her weeklong trip, even before she landed today. Democrats were trying to revive the criticism stirred up last year when Edward J. Rollins Jr., her campaign manager, said that he had pledged money to black clergy members if they would refrain from urging their congregations to vote for Gov. Jim Florio, her rival.
Mr. Rollins later recanted his story under oath and Mrs. Whitman steadfastly maintained that no such activity took place. But on Thursday Joe Cutbirth, the spokesman for the Texas Democratic Party, called on Republican candidates to "distance themselves from -- rather than embrace -- the racially insensitive politics that Mrs. Whitman represents."
Mick Voines, a spokesman for United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, said in an interview, "The Texas Democrats are in desperate political shape and grasping at any straw."
Mrs. Whitman said she was surprised and disappointed that some black ministers in Texas appeared to support the Democratic message. "Don't they realize that hurts their own communities?" she asked. "If people keep bringing this up, someone is going to believe that black ministers took bribes, and that's not true. Nothing, absolutely nothing, happened."
Mrs. Whitman was returning a political favor to Senator Hutchison, who went to New Jersey last year, when she agreed to campaign in Houston, Austin and San Antonio on Monday. But today she is campaigning for George W. Bush, the son of the former President, who is running for Governor against the Democratic incumbent, Ann W. Richards.
 
'Proven It Can Be Done'
 Karen Hughes, communications director for Mr. Bush, said Mrs. Whitman's staff contacted the Bush campaign and offered to have the Governor make some campaign appearances with Mr. Bush. "It turned out to be a good idea," Ms. Hughes said, "because Mrs. Whitman is a fiscal conservative and budget-cutter who has proven it can be done, and, like George Bush, wants to strengthen the juvenile justice system."
Mrs. Whitman is scheduled to campaign in Arizona for Fife Symington, who is running for re-election as Governor, and later for Gov. Pete Wilson of California before returning to New Jersey on Friday.
Dean R. Armandroff, executive director of the New Jersey Republican State Committee, said Mrs. Whitman's trip grew out of invitations picked up at Republican Governors Association meetings, as well as a desire by Mrs. Whitman to pay back party leaders for help she received during her campaign. In addition, the state party wants to get the Governor and her tax-cutting message around the country, he said.
 
'Other Balls in the Air'
 The New Jersey Republican Party raised the $15,000 to pay for Mrs. Whitman's trip and Mr. Armandroff said it was only the beginning. "We're planning another trip to the Midwest and a tour of the East Coast from New England to Florida before the November election," he said. "And we have other balls in the air."
Brendan T. Byrne Jr., the New Jersey Democratic chairman, said it was not surprising that Mrs. Whitman was using her new celebrity.
"It's not unusual," he said. "You go around the country building chits and denying that you have any national ambitions." But Mr. Byrne said that one thing puzzled him. "She seems to be campaigning for everybody but Haytaian," he said. "She's not raising money in her own backyard."
Garabed Haytaian, the Speaker of the New Jersey Assembly, is running against the Democratic incumbent, Frank R. Lautenberg, for United States Senate. Mr. Haytaian has strongly supported Mrs. Whitman's income-tax and budget cuts and a Haytaian campaign aide said talks were under way with the Whitman staff about how to best help him.

HEADLINE: THE GARDEN SALE: THE POLITICS;
State Officials Split on Antitrust Aspects of Garden's Sale

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Two of New York State's highest officials reacted in sharply different manners yesterday to the announcement that the ITT Corporation and Cablevision Systems had agreed to buy Madison Square Garden. Where one saw antitrust concerns, the other saw secure local ownership.
While Gov. Mario M. Cuomo praised the deal, New York State Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell immediately pronounced it flawed. He said that because Cablevision would gain sweeping control over television sports coverage in the New York market, there were significant antitrust concerns, and he announced that he planned to open an antitrust investigation. 
 "You already had great concentration of control and here you eliminate any competition whatsoever," Mr. Koppell said. "At least now, there's an overall competition right now between the networks over the packaging, the entire packaging of sports," he said, referring to the local competition between the Garden's MSG Network and Cablevision's Sportschannel.
But if the Cablevision acquisition proceeds, he said, "you have the owner of the venue, the owner of the teams and the owner of the access to the viewers all in one person."
With the deal, Cablevision will not only own the Knicks and Rangers, but will also televise the Mets, Nets and Devils on its Sportschannel pay-cable outlet and the Knicks, Rangers and Yankees on the MSG Network.
Mr. Koppell said his office had jurisdiction to enforce both New York and Federal antitrust laws and could sue to block the purchase.
Governor Cuomo took a sharply different position. Mr. Cuomo attended the news conference in which the companies announced the transaction and hailed the sale as one that would place the renowned New York City landmark, Madison Square Garden, in the secure hands of companies committed to the city.
"Who owns the Garden is very important to us," he said. "We were eager to see New Yorkers who are vested here, who have ties here, because that gives you more influence with them. If they're from out of town you have no hold on them. So I'm a lot more comfortable with these guys than with someone else."
The other bidder for the Garden, Liberty Media, is based in Denver.
Mr. Cuomo added that he had no antitrust concerns about the deal and said that he was not troubled by suggestions that the price paid by the buyers could ultimately lead to higher rates for households that subscribe to the MSG cable network.
The different postures may represent the varying strategies of the two men to gain the spotlight in an election year.
Mr. Koppell, a former state assemblyman who was named interim Attorney General by the State Legislature in December, faces a hotly contested race in the Democratic primary next month in a field of four major rivals. And Mr. Cuomo, also a Democrat, faces a tough re-election campaign in which his stewardship of the state has been the target of criticism from various aspirants, including State Senator George E. Pataki, his leading Republican rival.
"Their different views on the deal reflect the difference in the offices they hold," said Norman Adler, a political consultant. "The Governor's job is to bring home the bacon and build the economy of the state. The Attorney General is supposed to be a watchdog, seeing that consumers are safeguarded. And they're simply trying to position themselves to be seen by voters as doing their jobs well."
The Madison Square Garden purchase is not the only business deal Mr. Koppell has questioned on antitrust grounds. He also opposed the proposed merger of R. H. Macy & Company and Federated Department Stores, saying that the combination would decrease competition in the New York department store market.

HEADLINE: Tool Orders Off 14.6% in July

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools fell 14.6 percent, to $344.75 million, in July but remained above the level recorded in the same month last year, a trade group reported yesterday.
The Association for Manufacturing Technology said machine tool orders were down from $403.65 million in June, but were 39.2 percent higher than orders in July 1993. Orders for the year so far totaled $2.49 billion, 23.6 percent higher than the $2.02 billion in the corresponding period last year. 
 "Even though there was a 15 percent decline in orders during July, it's interesting to note that this is the highest total for that month since 1979," said Albert W. Moore, president of the association, which is based in McLean, Va.
Machine tool orders are considered a gauge of future economic activity because an increase in orders indicates that manufacturers believe future sales will rise. The monthly report covers metal-cutting and metal-forming machine tools, which are used to make goods from household appliances to aircraft engines.
Domestic orders fell 10.6 percent, to $321.7 million, in July, from $359.85 million in June. They were 39.4 percent higher than the July 1993 level. Export orders fell 47.4 percent, to $23.05 million, in July, from $43.8 million in June. They were up 36.4 percent from a year earlier.
Machine tool shipments in July fell 32.5 percent, to $250.6 million, from $371.3 million in June. But they rose 5 percent from the level of July 1993.
The July machine tool order backlog totaled $1.76 billion, up from $1.67 billion in June. The backlog for July 1993 was $1.5 billion.

HEADLINE: A Split Over Fed's Role;
Clashes Seen After Vice Chairman Says Job Creation Should Also Be a Policy Goal

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 28

 BODY:
By publicly challenging the views of his boss on the mission of the Federal Reserve Bank, the agency's vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder, touched off a dispute that could lead to clashes over policy on interest rates, many economists said over the weekend.
Speaking at the Federal Reserve's annual conference here on Saturday, Mr. Blinder called for central banks around the world, including the Fed, to set interest rates so as to pursue low inflation and low unemployment. 
 In the past, however, the agency's chairman, Alan Greenspan, has called for an interest rate policy that focuses on low inflation alone.
Though the disagreement is largely theoretical now, it makes it likely that the nation's two top central bankers would take different positions on interest rates if unemployment rose. Who wins will affect the interest rates that Americans pay on credit cards, car loans and home mortgages.
Unemployment in the United States, which was at 6.1 percent in July, was already so low that Mr. Blinder said a further drop might stoke inflation, which has been running at nearly 3 percent annually. The Federal Reserve has already raised short-term interest rates five times this year, and Mr. Blinder has endorsed those moves.
But economists here predicted that if unemployment rose, Mr. Blinder would be more reluctant than many of his colleagues to raise rates further, producing clashes about policy.
"He does have a different approach and a different opinion," said Richard B. Berner, the chief economist at Mellon Bank.
Mr. Greenspan told a Congressional panel on Aug. 10 that he favored legislation to set zero inflation as the Federal Reserve's sole goal. But Mr. Blinder said this afternoon that the Federal Reserve should pursue the multiple goals set forth in current legislation, which include low inflation and maximum employment.
Mr. Greenspan also said in his testimony on Aug. 10 that any employment gains from allowing inflation to rise were "ephemeral." Yet Mr. Blinder said today that he did not believe that and interest rate increases to control inflation could hurt employment for a year or two.
Mr. Blinder said he agreed with Mr. Greenspan that in the long term -- which he defined as 5 to 10 years -- inflation and interest rates could not be used to hold down unemployment. Still, he characterized his disagreements with Mr. Greenspan as not serious.
 
Chairman on Vacation
 Mr. Greenspan attended the conference from Thursday through Saturday, but went on vacation today and could not be reached for comment.
Mr. Blinder is President Clinton's first appointee to the Federal Reserve Board and one of several candidates to become the next chairman in early 1996, when Mr. Greenspan's term expires. Mr. Greenspan was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 and reappointed by President George Bush in 1992.
Aspirants to the chairmanship have historically talked tough about inflation and played down the importance of unemployment in an effort to reassure financial markets that they will not allow inflation to rise. That temporarily creates jobs but makes the fixed interest payments on bonds much less attractive.
Several economists here said Mr. Blinder's remarks suggested that he was willing to force his colleagues to confront the social problems created by higher interest rates even at a possible cost to his career. Asked about that in an interview this afternoon, Mr. Blinder said, "I am not going to play to the gallery and I'm going to say what I think." He declined to discuss his future further.
 
View on Employment

Mr. Greenspan has contended that employment issues should be left to the free market and that unemployment will remain low if prices stay stable and companies are confident that they can invest in job-creating new factories and equipment without fear of inflation.
Mr. Berner of Mellon Bank said Mr. Blinder's comments on Saturday were unlikely to have a strong effect on financial markets on Monday. While Mr. Blinder has spoken strongly about a need to focus on reducing inflation since he joined the Federal Reserve Board, he took some of the same positions that he defended today while he was an economics professor at Princeton University. Many on Wall Street think his true views remain those from his academic days, Mr. Berner said.
But other private economists expressed surprise that Mr. Blinder's views had not changed more since he joined the Fed, which, like the Supreme Court, tends to mold the people who serve on it.
Mr. Blinder said on Saturday that even if unemployment were high he would prefer slow to rapid changes in interest-rate policy. "How could I as a central banker argue against gradualism?" he said. "I won't."
Representative Stephen L. Neal, a conservative Democrat from North Carolina, said Mr. Blinder's stance risked higher inflation. "That's exactly what got us in trouble in the late 1970's, the idea that we can fine-tune the economy," he said in a telephone interview from his home in northern Virginia.
But Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Budget Committee and has long criticized the Fed for insensitivity to the unemployed, praised Mr. Blinder today in a telephone interview from Tennessee. "I am greatly encouraged that we have a member of the Federal Reserve now that understands that the Federal Reserve is charged not only with controlling inflation but also with managing the economy to create jobs," he said.
Mr. Blinder sought to assuage some of these concerns in his speech on Saturday. He pointed out that one explanation of the high inflation in the 1970's was that central banks were slow to raise interest rates. While he did not specifically endorse this explanation, he said that if world oil prices rose sharply and American economic output fell, "then it's the duty of the central bank to contract aggregate demand" through higher interest rates.
Mr. Blinder's comments appeared to anger some colleagues, who discussed his speech at a barbecue Saturday night at the end of the conference. One senior Fed official who insisted on anonymity called Mr. Blinder an "outlier" -- an economics term for a point on a graph that is far removed from the other points.
Thomas Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said in an interview today that he believed Mr. Blinder's remarks on Saturday were consistent with an emphasis on stable prices. But, he added, "I think stable prices are the primary goal."
Unlike several other central bankers here, Mr. Blinder spoke without a prepared text, and his comments were much more blunt than those of his colleagues. In an interview after the speech, he said he was not aware that Mr. Greenspan had publicly endorsed the idea of setting a single target for the Federal Reserve of fighting inflation.
Mr. Blinder took a very different position from that of Mr. Greenspan in what may be the single biggest dispute in monetary economics: whether unemployment can be reduced by allowing higher inflation. Mr. Blinder said the trade-off, known as the Phillips curve, existed for periods of up to a few years. Mr. Greenspan told Congress this summer that the Phillips curve "is dead," except for periods of time so brief as to be unimportant.
Some economists contend that the Federal Reserve has deliberately tried to discredit the Phillips curve to avoid taking responsibility for the unemployment that its interest rate increases can cause as purchases of houses and cars decline, prompting builders and auto makers to lay off workers.
Congressional Democrats amended the Federal Reserve Act in 1978 to require that the central bank pursue "maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
Representative Neal has introduced a bill, supported by Mr. Greenspan, that would replace this language with a requirement that the Fed pursue zero inflation. Because of opposition from other Democrats, the bill has never emerged from the House Banking Committee, which oversees monetary policy, and is unlikely to do so soon.

HEADLINE: Crime Fighters Draw A Line in the Grass

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
What convinced Deborah Forde was her scar, the one left by muggers who violently ripped a gold chain from her neck while she was jogging in Prospect Park last year.
For Dante Jordan, it was the memory of having his bike stolen at knife-point. Suzann Bassil simply wanted a little independence. She likes to cycle and does not want to wait for her boyfriend to get off work to accompany her. 
 The three are among 450 Brooklyn residents who have agreed to be on the lookout in Prospect Park as they go about their recreation, carrying phones that dial directly to 911 and wearing vests that identify them to other park users.
 
 
On Rollerblades, on Foot
 The program, begun last week, springs from the success of neighborhood watch groups in which people from the same block band together to fight crime. The volunteers in the new program represent a diverse lot of Brooklynites, coming from various corners of the park -- from Crown Heights to Park Slope -- and different jogs of life.
There is a doctor and a milkman, a retired bird watcher and an unemployed hospital worker. There are bankers, nannies and scrappy teen-agers. Most do not know each other, and they often share very little outside of their love of the park.
Their motivations differ, too. Some have had bad experiences in the park, and are carrying the phones principally to protect themselves. Others have grand dreams of guarding their neighbors from evil. "I want to protect New Yorkers," said Norman Weissman, 50, after dropping by the 78th Precinct to pick up his phone.
And many said that they had seen news reports of the killing of a teacher in the park last year, and of rapes this year, and felt that being armed with a phone and a sense of responsibility, they had at least a psychological edge over those who come to spoil their place of peace.
 
The Last Frontier
 "It's not costing me anything," said Mr. Jordan, who rides his bike in the park daily, now with his phone. "If there is something I can do to make life better for everyone else while feeling safe doing what I love to do, which is ride my bike, why not?"
 For New Yorkers, the local park is often the final frontier in the urban showdown against crime. Though they will step over crushed crack vials on their streets, scurry past vagrants who sleep or shoot up on their stoops, and pay cab fares to avoid the subway at night, they seem unwilling to surrender their right to stroll in their park.
"When you go into a public park, you go in there anticipating freedom," said Barry Tindall, director of the National Recreation and Park Association, an advocacy group for park planners in Arlington, Va. "It's your free time. You've chosen to be there and you let your guard down. And when you feel your space and your body is violated in that time, the feeling is horrendous."
The volunteers in Prospect Park are not trained, nor are they obligated to alter their activities: skating, cycling, sunbathing, strolling, walking dogs, baby-sitting, or just enjoying the park. The idea is simply to be around and alert should trouble find its way into the park.
On Friday night, Paul Kim and his fiancee, Maureen Brogan, both medical students, took their nightly constitutional, zipping twice around the park on Rollerblades. Miss Brogan, 27, sported the bright blue vest, while Mr. Kim wore the black fanny pack that stored the phone. They received smiles and a wave or two from other visitors, but found no use for the phone.
 
 
No Flood of Calls
 All of the dozens of volunteers interviewed said they had not yet needed to call 911, and the police confirm that they have not yet received any reports, but all agreed that the volunteers' presence gives other park visitors a sense that they are somehow more secure.
"This was something that the community needed," said Mr. Kim, 26. "I have a fiancee using the park and I would like it to be safe for her and other women."
Although at 525 acres Prospect Park is smaller than Central Park, it can feel larger and more remote. It has a single drive and no transverse roads, and its 90-acre meadow is shadowed by forest and foliage rather than skyscrapers, giving it the distinct feel of a country hideaway.
Since 1980, the administrators of the park, which was designed by Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted, have worked to restore its 1800's grandeur, said Tupper W. Thomas, the park's current administrator. Partly because of those efforts, the park now attracts about 6 million people annually, up from just 1.7 million in 1980.
 
 
Shadows of a Teacher's Death
 On a sunny day this week, when the park was hardly full, the specter of menace seemed almost unimaginable. Rollerbladers whizzed by. A couple sat kissing on a picnic bench. A German shepherd, startled by a lone walker, barked until his owner smacked him lightly on the head and scolded, "Hey, you don't own the park."
But it was in the middle of a similar sunny day last June that Allyn Winslow, a 42-year-old drama teacher, was shot to death as he tried to escape three teen-agers who were trying to steal his new mountain bike.
Last week, in an indication that park-goers may be getting more vigilant, a group of people grabbed and subdued a sex offender who the police say was trying to kidnap a 9-year-old girl, also in the middle of the day.
Cases like these, which have increased in recent years in Prospect Park, are what led the Police Department to approach people earlier this year and ask them if they would carry the cellular phones while in the park between 5 A.M. and 9 P.M.
To the Police Department's surprise, nearly everyone they approached was eager to participate. "I expected to get the minimum," said Sgt. Joseph Lavelle, the "Safe Parks" coordinator for the 78th Precinct. "But instead, we got the maximum."
The program, along with a smaller one in Marcus Garvey Park in Harlem, is a pilot that the department hopes to expand to all city parks by next spring. The precinct has already enlisted 450 volunteers, and by late yesterday, had distributed about 200 phones, which were donated by Nynex and Motorola.
 
 
At the 78th Precinct
 Every night last week, the precinct filled after work with volunteers coming to collect their fanny packs, and with other neighborhood residents looking to sign on.
"A friend told me about this," said Ms. Forde, 24, the switchboard operator who lost her gold chain to muggers as she was jogging last year.
Ms. Forde, who lives in Crown Heights, was left with a scar on her neck, but she went right back into the park. "When that happened," she said, "people saw but there was nothing much they could do. There were no phones around."
Unlike many of the volunteers, Suzann Bassil has no children, and she does not consider herself a particularly altruistic sort. Rather, she is enraged by the idea of not being able to venture into the park without fear. "I want to ride my bike alone," she said. "Who wants to wait around for somebody? It becomes tedious."
With that, she grabbed her fanny pack and left the precinct to go home and get ready for a night of peaceful solitude in the park.

HEADLINE: New Wave From Southeast Asia Is Hitting New York Real Estate

BYLINE: By ASHLEY DUNN 

 BODY:
They seemed to come out of nowhere -- a powerful group of Hong Kong billionaires who appeared in June to revive Donald J. Trump's troubled Riverside South project with millions in cash and a promise to finance the multibillion-dollar development.
But while the names of the new investors were largely unknown here, the size and power of their move into New York came as no surprise to brokers familiar with the recent influx of overseas investment. 
 Over the last two years, a surge of money from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia has swept into the city's battered real-estate market in a variety of high-profile deals. Drawn by bargain prices and a market that offers a haven from the turmoil of speculation in the Far East, those investors, largely ethnic Chinese from Hong Kong and Singapore, have bought some of the city's choice properties.
And while the deals have been modest in number, their size and scope has brokers predicting that the new Asian investors could become the deal makers of the 1990's, driving the real-estate market as the Japanese did in the 1980's, and the Canadians and the Europeans did in the 1970's.
"Ten years ago, it would have been unheard of," said Mr. Trump, who had never dealt with Hong Kong or Southeast Asian investors before the Riverside South deal. "There's a great deal of money and a great deal of expertise in the Far East, and they're beginning to spread their wings."
The Riverside South project is the most notable of the new Asian investments in New York, but in its shadow have been other deals, including the sale of the 1,000-room New York Palace Hotel to interests from Brunei for $202 million in November, the 561-room Hotel Millenium to Singaporean investors for $75 million in February, and an older, 1.1-million-square-foot office building at 40 Wall Street to a Hong Kong group for $8 million last May.
While Asian investors have also bought property on the West Coast, from mini-malls in Los Angeles to sprawling residential and commercial projects in Vancouver, British Columbia, many investors have focused on New York because of its supply of quality buildings and its stature in international trade and finance.
"Chinese firms have just begun to look internationally," said Edmund Yu, president of Kinson Properties, which purchased the Wall Street building for the company's Hong Kong owners. "They figure it is time to come out, and now they have the capital to play with the big boys."
European, Canadian and Japanese companies still have by far the largest holdings of all foreign investors in New York, but the new investors have begun to alter the nature of the market, as Asian companies open offices here to search for potential investments and local brokers learn the ways of doing business with companies from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.
"Millions are flowing out of Hong Kong now," said Peter Friedman, president of the New York commercial real-estate firm of Peter R. Friedman Ltd. "Two years ago, they weren't even on the scope. This year, they're going to be number one."
The entry of the new Asian investors has been fueled by an enormous buildup of capital in the Far East, much of which was initially invested in Asia and is only now being turned toward the United States.
 
Most Dynamic Area
 For the last decade, the regional economy of China, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia has been the most dynamic in the world. And while Japan still languishes in a recession, economic growth elsewhere in Asia is expected to increase by more than 7 percent next year, nearly triple the pace projected for the United States, according to estimates from the International Monetary Fund.
Like many Asian investors, Mr. Yu said, the owners of Kinson Properties began their forays into real estate by buying in areas they were most familiar with -- in their case, Hong Kong and China. In China alone, the company has invested up to $1.5 billion since the late 1980's, Mr. Yu said.
The company's New York purchase was small in comparison, but was done in part to establish an overseas base, an important consideration for many Hong Kong companies in preparation for the transfer of the British colony to Chinese control in 1997, he said.
Another reason, Mr. Yu added, was that for many Hong Kong investors, buying into New York has become cheap.
Back in the 1980's, top-quality office space in New York went for as much as $500 a square foot. Today, sale prices in the volatile Hong Kong market have risen to about $1,200 a square foot, while New York prices have fallen to about $150 to $200 a square foot for prime office buildings, a level that he believes is as low as it will ever go.
Kinson Properties bought the older building at 40 Wall Street for $7 a square foot, although it has required extensive renovation that will likely push the final cost to around $50 a square foot.
"The differential is just too much," Mr. Yu said. "There is a huge price disparity. They can't understand why people would sell at that price."
The prices in New York in the 1990's dropped substantially from the preceding decade, when Japanese investors helped push the market to high levels.
From 1984 to 1990, the total value of Japanese-owned real estate in New York State, most of which was invested in the city, jumped from $800 million to over $10 billion, according to figures from the Federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.
But after the flurry of buying through the late 1980's, new Japanese investment has dropped off. Investment from the Middle East, Canada and Europe also has slowed from the heady pace of the late 1980's.
Although the Japanese buying led to warnings about the selling of America, the actual Japanese share of the city's real-estate market is small. At best, Japanese companies -- the single largest group of foreign real-estate investors -- own only about 3 percent of the $2.7 trillion in commercial real estate in New York City, according to figures from the real-estate firm of Cushman & Wakefield.
 
Driving the Market
 While their share was small, they represented a significant portion of new investment and were able to drive the prices of the market.
In a similar fashion, brokers in New York say that the new Asian investors have the potential to assume a powerful position in the market. They have concentrated their investments in hotels and properties in financial trouble, which has often allowed them to buy at favorable prices.
The value of property owned by Asian companies, with the exception of those from Japan, is below even 1 percent of all commercial property, according to figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
But at least for the moment, they are striking some of the biggest and most prominent deals.
"Right now, I would guess they are dominating about 50 percent of the buying power in the market," said Darcy A. Stacom, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield who represented the buyers in the 40 Wall Street sale. "If they're willing I could see them eventually matching the share of the Japanese."
One of the largest real-estate purchases in New York City last year was made by the Amedeo Hotels Limited Partnership, which bought the New York Palace Hotel on Madison Avenue for $202 million. The company is owned by the royal family of Brunei, an oil-rich sultanate on the island of Borneo.
 
Quarter of the Action
 The hotel purchase alone accounted for nearly a quarter of the $874 million in commercial property sales in the city last year, according to figures from Cushman & Wakefield.
This year, the attention has been focused on the agreement to build the Riverside South project between Mr. Trump and a group of Hong Kong investors that includes the New World Development Company, headed by Y. T. Cheng and his son, Henry, and the Shui On Group, headed by Vincent Lo.
The Riverside South project covers 75 acres on the Upper West Side of Manhattan along the Hudson River, from 59th to 72d streets.
The $2.5 billion project had been languishing until the arrival of the Hong Kong investors, who purchased Mr. Trump's $250 million debt on the land for $90 million and made a commitment to finance the construction of Riverside South.
Mr. Trump said he had never dealt with investors from Hong Kong or Southeast Asia before, but on this project he found himself facing offers from four Asian companies -- two from Hong Kong, one from Singapore and one from Malaysia. He added that he is currently working with yet another Hong Kong group on a separate commercial and residential development.
Despite the size of the recent investments from Asia, some brokers here caution that the new generation of overseas investors are different from the Japanese and may never become as influential.
 
Extremely Selective
 Jack A. Shaffer, managing director of international sales for the New York real-estate firm of Sonnenblick-Goldman Company, said the new Asian investors had been extremely selective, picking off properties that are selling at bargain prices. Whether they will continue buying as the market moves upward is uncertain, he said.
In addition, the investors have plenty of opportunities in their own backyards, particularly China, where returns can be far higher.
"You've got to remember that they have alternatives," he said. "The major sales in greater New York are coming out of Southeast Asia, but what will happen in the future isn't really that clear yet."
But Paul Chan, the New York representative of the Glorious Sun group from Hong Kong, said he believed the big purchases of the last two years are only the beginning of a larger movement of capital from Asia. His own group spent $32 million on a block on condominiums at Worldwide Plaza, an office and residential development on West 50th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues.
Mr. Chan said the crowded Hong Kong real-estate market and the unpredictable nature of real-estate investment in China made New York an appropriate investment for companies seeking a larger international presence.
Even if investment from Hong Kong and Singapore ultimately fades, he added, there are many investors from Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and potentially the biggest player of all, China itself, who are set to enter the fray.
"All the big investors are out there looking," he said. "Just looking at the economic potential of China, I am very confident of investment here in the future."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
The Mood Improves On Wall St.

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan is not going to be mean to investors anymore. Or so much of Wall Street now believes.
And if that belief persists, and if confidence grows that the economy and corporate profits will not suffer greatly at the current level of interest rates, the stock rally that surprised Wall Street last week could have a considerable way to go. 
 "I think the next move the Federal Reserve will make will be to reduce interest rates, not to raise them," said Byron Wien, the chief American equity strategist for Morgan Stanley, discussing one reason he expectsthe next big move in stock prices to be up.
 
Data Foster New Mood
 The belief that the Fed, headed by Mr. Greenspan, would not need to raise rates again, after the surprisingly large move on Aug. 16, has been reinforced by a series of economic figures during the last two weeks that pointed to less robust growth.
The new mood helped push the Dow Jones industrial average up more than 125 points, or 3.4 percent, to 3,881.05 last week. All major stock averages are now at their highest points since March.
The happiness with the Fed is in sharp contrast to the mood that has generally prevailed after the previous rounds of credit tightening, beginning in February, which sent bond prices down sharply. But this time, the bond market has reacted reasonably well. Bond prices are generally a bit higher than before the latest Fed move, and short-term interest rates, which are set by the market, have fallen.
 
'Best of All Worlds' Is Seen
 "We really have the best-of-all-worlds scenario here, for the economy and the stock market," says one enthusiastic economist, Edward Yardeni of C. J. Lawrence. He says the evidence indicates the economy is growing in a way that will increase corporate profits without pushing up inflation rates.
In the stock market slump that followed the earlier Fed tightenings, it was professional money managers who showed the most concern. "Individual investors have kept the faith," noted Abby Joseph Cohen, the co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
While stock mutual funds have seen the rates of inflow slow from the heady days of earlier this year, investors are still putting money in them, even while money has slowly drained out of bond mutual funds. Corporate insiders have also been buying their own stocks in larger volumes than normal. What has been new in recent days is that professionals now seem to be showing more willingness to invest in stocks.
There is, of course, much more to the stock market rally, which has seen the Dow rise 7.1 percent since late July and left it just 2.4 percent below the peak it set on Jan. 31, a few days before the Fed's first tightening. Signs that the dollar is beginning to strengthen -- it climbed back to more than 100 Japanese yen on Friday -- have begun to draw some European interest, brokers say. There is encouragement about corporate profits, and a strong surge of takeovers.
And there are signs that the prevalent speculation just before the rally was against the stock market. Part of the story of last week's rise was a scramble that occurred as a money manager lost some money on an options trade that had been intended to make money unless the stock market took off quickly.
"The lore says the market always goes down while the Fed is tightening," said Mr. Wien, adding that as stocks traded in a narrow range recently, a lot of money was bet on the thesis that the next big move would be down. When share prices began to leap last week, a lot of those speculators had to buy stocks quickly to cut losses.
There is no guarantee that last week's rally will have any follow-through, and some recent precedent to suggest that it won't. Last week's move in the Dow was the best weekly gain since the week that ended on Feb. 5, 1993, when the Clinton Administration was just getting going. In that week, the index leaped 132 points, or 4 percent. But in the next two weeks the index gave up 120 of those points.
Still, the supply and demand outlook for the market seems to have improved, Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates, a market analysis firm, said. The calendar of new equity offerings is relatively light, reflecting the concern that had gripped many investors until the last two weeks. And the supply of available shares has been depleted by a growing amount of corporate purchases of their own shares -- buybacks -- and of others' shares -- mergers.
That reflects the fact that corporate profits -- and available cash -- seem to be rising at a good clip. Thomas Doerflinger, an investment strategist at Paine Webber, says he expects operating earnings of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 to rise 16.6 percent this year and 10.1 percent more in 1995. "It is difficult to identify a major sector whose earnings will be down next year," he said.
That would not be true if the economy began to falter. But with other economies growing, Wall Street seems inclined to believe that the economy will avoid both serious inflation and recession, with the economic expansion continuing until 1996.
The consensus is that the Fed, at worst, will stay on the sidelines until after the November election, and that if there is to be one more tightening, that will be the last one. Many think there will be no more tightenings at all.
The change in atmosphere regarding the Fed is traceable in part to the fact that it chose to raise by half a percentage point both the Federal funds rate, the rate banks pay on loans to one another, and the discount rate, the rate banks pay to borrow from the Fed. The consensus forecast had been for a smaller increase in the Federal funds rate and no change in the discount rate.
"People said, 'Wow, the Fed is really serious and maybe this is all they will do,' " Mrs. Cohen said.

Yesterday Was Just Perfect for a Ball Game

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW 

 BODY:
YANKEE STADIUM was like a morgue yesterday. The sun was shining brightly, the field was gorgeous with the manicured grass as green as a pool table, the tan infield dirt was smartly raked. It was a perfect day for a ball game. The first-place Yankees, according to the schedule, were supposed to be playing the Texas Rangers, in the heat of a pennant race. But Yankee Stadium yesterday was as silent as a cadaver.
Except for the soft whir sprinkler system that is run by computers in the stadium basement and which pop up for a time first in right field, and then behind third base, and somewhere else after that, the playing field, the broad, wondrous sweeping diamond, was empty. No runners, no hitters, no one to err. 
 Like the stands. Like all of the 57,545 stark blue seats in the ball park. From the box seats to the grandstands to the bleachers that curve down from the familiar Gothic facade of the roof. Empty. No cheering. No booing. Nothing.
If someone had been held captive in a cave for the last few weeks and was released to see a ball game here and didn't know anything about the strike -- the dispute between the major league owners and the players that is now in its 18th day -- he might have wondered: Had he arrived too late and the game was over? After all, cigarette butts remain in the aisles, and peanut shells, and flattened paper cups. Or maybe there had been a bomb scare, and everyone evacuated. Surely something weird had occurred.
It was reminiscent of a recurring dream that Mickey Mantle had shortly after his retirement. He dreamed of going to a game and not being allowed in. That there were locks on the gates. And he heard his name announced as the next batter. It was a sad dream. A kind of nightmare. For baseball fans now, this, too, is a bad dream come true.
No one there to buy a hot dog that is advertised on a sign in the grandstand. No one to hail a vendor for a Slurpee, as seen on another sign in the outfield. There was no crack of the bat. No smack of a fastball into the catcher's plump mitt. No one to stretch in the seventh and wail "Take Me Out to the Ballgame."
The skeleton crew in the Yankee office was off yesterday. The space in the parking lot reserved for George Steinbrenner's limousine, and those for the cars of his pinstriped employees, was vacant. Only a couple of security men and an engineer were on the premises, to keep things in working order in case someone turned the season back on.
Across the street from the ball park and under the elevated train tracks on River Road, Stan's Sports Bar and Grill is shuttered down. Discount Dugout is closed. As is Baseball Land. Only Stadium Souvenir is open, but the proprietor, Abdul Al Sacahi, says business is dead.
"Very slow, they wreck my business," he said, as a train rumbled over head. He held up a slip of paper. "Here, this is my bill for the rent. $4,500. I can't pay it. Maybe have to close up next week. They told me they don't know when strike will be over. They told me maybe next month. Maybe next year. Have you heard anything?"
No one knows, unless it's the owners. And they are gagging themselves.
On the other side of Yankee Stadium is Macombs Dam Park, with a sign above a handball court that reads, "We Do Care. New York Yankees Neighborhood Project 2." There is also a basketball court and a ball field. Games were on both.
The basketball court was a center of controversy earlier in the season when Richard Kraft, the Yankees' vice president in charge of community relations, was forced to resign after supposedly telling a magazine reporter that kids hung "like monkeys" from the rims.
"Most of us don't try to hang from the rims," said Abe Johnson, one of the Sunday morning players, who works in computers for Smith Barney. "We like the rims straight. But maybe one or two of the younger kids was trying to imitate the pros."
How did he feel about the major league situation? "Baseball is commercialism," said Johnson. "And I think there's greed on both sides. But I majored in economics, and I know it's likely that the owners have two sets of books."
At the ball field, there was, unlike the big white structure across the road, a ball game in progress. It was a kids' game between the green-and-white uniformed Rosado Design team and the red-and-white NatWest nine.
"I told you to swing only at strikes, Irvin," said a coach to a player.
"It was a strike," said the player.
"It almost hit you in the head -- how can you call that a strike?" said the coach.
Another hitter lined a single. "Way to rip, Jacob!" came a shout from the bleachers.
The players were playing on a field with grass up to their ankles. A Stadium groundskeeper could have done wonders in minutes.
"It's a shame," said Dennis Centeno, the NatWest coach. "One of my kids could get hurt because you can't see the holes in the field."
It was a hot day under the sun. There were two water fountains nearby, but both were broken. "My players are thirsty and there's nothing to drink, so I have to run to the store to buy them juice," said Centeno. "I know the Yankees have a sign that says they care. But how much?"
One player wondered if any Yankees were in the park. "What's wrong with you?" said a teammate. "Do you think they're playing dominoes? It's a strike!"
Some around the Stadium thought the owners right, some the players. Like some editorial writers, some thought neither was right. But if, in America, one side, the players, are seeking only to maintain their position of being paid for what they can command in the open market, what's so wrong?
In Yankee Stadium now, the water fountain in the dugout was dusty. The railings in the vacant stands sparkled in the sunlight. But all that bespoke of baseball were the silent monuments in center field. The ghosts of Ruth and Gehrig and DiMaggio and Mantle.
It was a perfect day for a ball game. But all was still. Like a morgue.

HEADLINE: For Nonmusicals, New York Is Still The Field of Dreams

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Robert Falls, the artistic director at the Goodman Theater here, was talking about New York and its current, difficult-to-define place in the American theater universe.
"There's no doubt the whole romantic notion of Broadway as a place to open a play does not apply anymore," he said, giving voice to a widely held view that the most glamorous commercial-theater venue in the world is no longer hospitable to nonmusical dramas. "It's been completely usurped by the regionals." 
 Yet, he acknowledged, Broadway aside, New York is still the place where plays go for the imprimatur of quality (or at least commercial viability) necessary for a life beyond its original production. Indeed, in recent interviews that focused on the relationship between theater in New York and elsewhere in the country, executives at several institutional theaters here and on the West Coast said that in spite of the rise of the regionals in recent years, New York still exerts its primacy over what appears on stages nationwide.
 
The Press, Talent and Theaters
 One reason, of course, is that New York is where the most influential press is.
A second is that New York is where much of the talent is. All the large regional companies, and many of the small ones, look to New York to cast their shows. Many artistic directors of regional theaters have substantial New York directing credits, including Mr. Falls (whose "Suburbia" is now completing a summerlong run at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center) and Daniel Sullivan of the Seattle Repertory Company ("The Sisters Rosensweig" on Broadway and "The Merry Wives of Windsor" in Central Park), to name just two among many.
A third is that New York is still where the heart of the commercial theater is, Off Broadway as well as on. Plays like David Mamet's "Oleanna," first produced at the Orpheum Theater Off Broadway, and now Edward Albee's "Three Tall Women" (which may be produced this season at the Steppenwolf Theater Company here) are the latest proof that a celebrated New York run, even in an out-of-the-way theater, can translate into a long life in other cities. Theaters all over the country fill their schedules with shows that have proved to be hits in New York. And though none of the directors interviewed said they chose their productions with the prospect of moving them to New York, all acknowledged that the revenue their productions can generate if they get there is extremely gratifying.
 
'At the Big Table'
 "Everyone dreams of the oil well," said Gordon Davidson, the artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, "the benchmark being 'A Chorus Line,' " the show that generated millions of dollars for the New York Shakespeare Festival.
Jack O'Brien, the artistic director of the Old Globe Theater in San Diego, said, "You have to be able to play cards at the big table."
Mr. O'Brien, the director of the current Broadway revival of "Damn Yankees," which originated at the Old Globe, added: "Something like 'Damn Yankees' used to be the exception. Now it's what you have to bring to the table in order to survive."
As a result, if New York City is no longer the source, the place where all theater starts, it has become more of a hub, the place where everything checks in before heading elsewhere. It's a rare play -- Jane Martin's "Keely and Du" and Pearl Cleage's "Flyin' West" are current exceptions -- that makes the rounds of American theaters without stopping in New York.
"I'm trying to think of the last time we sent something somewhere else but New York," said Mr. Falls, who is the director of "Suburbia," Eric Bogosian's new play, which opened not at the Goodman, but at Lincoln Center at the Newhouse . "It's been a long time, I'll tell you."
 
'New York Is Always the Goal'
 He finally came up with Scott McPherson's "Marvin's Room," which in 1990 moved to the Hartford Stage after opening at the Goodman the previous year. But that show turned out to be on its way to New York. After Hartford, it went to Playwrights Horizons, and then on to a commercial run Off Broadway. Since then it has been everywhere.
"New York is always the goal," Mr. Falls said. "You'd like to say that the regional theaters have usurped that, but no. If 'Suburbia' had been produced at the Goodman, I don't think there would be as many theaters clamoring to produce it as there are now."
Stephen Eich, the managing director of the Steppenwolf Theater Company here, agreed that New York was still the prime economic force in the theater, but he portrayed its role in the relationship between it and the regionals as less benign, more of a monster that needs to be fed.
The empty theaters on Broadway, he said, in spite of the forbidding economics of producing plays there, have turned Broadway producers particularly ravenous. During the last several seasons, Steppenwolf has sent three productions to Broadway -- "The Grapes of Wrath," "The Song of Jacob Zulu" and "The Rise and Fall of Little Voice" -- with varying degrees of critical acclaim. None have made their money back, even though "Grapes" won a 1991 Tony for best play. The theater had far better luck with such previous shows as "Orphans" and "True West," plays that moved to Off Broadway theaters and then went on to longer lives.
 
'So Weird Out There'
 "The productions we've taken to New York lately have been drawn to New York by interest from New York," Mr. Eich said. "And the atmosphere is so weird out there. There's maybe a kind of desperation. That it's so barren out there has maybe warped perspective."
He couldn't help adding, however: "It's not like we wouldn't consider it again."
Mr. Davidson, who founded the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in 1967, remembered that during the 60's, the decade in which the regional-theater movement took hold, the shows produced outside New York were largely lesser works by the greatest playwrights.
"I would say, somewhat sarcastically but not entirely, that a typical regional-theater season had one Shaw, one Shakespeare, one Chekhov, one Arthur Miller and one Tennessee Williams," he said. "And whenever possible you did a play that had fallen into the public domain, so you didn't have to pay for the rights. In those days, if I called an agent and said, 'Do you have any new plays?,' they'd laugh at me, or send me stuff rejected by all the Broadway producers."
Now, of course, he said, the opposite is true, with the larger goal being to develop new works and send them off into the world for the most prosperous possible lives.
"Very few plays are perfect," Mr. Davidson said. "They either need more work, or they need the Good Housekeeping seal of approval." The latter, he said, is what New York provides.
The current production at the Taper is "The Waiting Room," a new play by Lisa Loomer, about the exploitation of women by men and medicine.
"I don't know if it will be a success," he said, in an interview conducted while the show was in previews. "But if it touches an audience, I will try and see it gets around. My main concern is prolonging life for a play. Going to New York will help that."

HEADLINE: Speak Louder on Rights in China

 BODY:
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, now in China with an entourage of U.S. executives, is being spared the personal humiliations showered on his Cabinet colleague, Warren Christopher, last March. Those spring tantrums achieved their goal of convincing the Clinton Administration to drop all human rights conditions for China's tariff privileges. Though Mr. Brown yesterday promised to raise human rights concerns with his hosts, he has made it clear that commerce is his priority.
Beijing is showing its appreciation by upgrading the Commerce Secretary's protocol status to "Presidential envoy." But on matters of substance, China has given the Administration little to show for its human rights retreat. 
 Mr. Brown arrived amid reports that Qin Yongmin, who protested against China hosting the 2000 Olympic Games, has been beaten and mutilated in a prison labor camp. Wang Dan, a student leader in the Tiananmen Square movement, was briefly detained Saturday after weeks of surveillance. Wei Jingsheng, China's leading democracy activist, who was harassed during Mr. Christopher's visit, soon after disappeared into the labyrinth of China's penal system and has not been heard from since.
As for Mr. Clinton's original human rights conditions, progress went into reverse the day the President changed his policy. As The Times's Patrick Tyler reports, China has continued to round up democracy, labor and religious activists, including some it had previously released, like Mr. Wei. It has broken off talks with the Voice of America over jamming of its broadcasts and dropped discussions with the Red Cross about humanitarian visits to prisons. China has also toughened its terms for talking to Washington about proliferation issues.
This tough-minded behavior should come as no surprise. While Beijing always reacts badly to public pressure, it never concedes anything when it believes there is no penalty for refusing.
How can the United States now recover its human rights credibility? One way would be for Mr. Brown to persuade American businessmen to adopt a voluntary code of conduct, which would assure minimal labor standards, restrict business cooperation with political surveillance activities and prohibit dealing with suppliers that use prison labor.
Another would be to begin loosely linking progress on particular U.S. grievances to relevant aspects of the official U.S.-China relationship. For example, progress on Voice of America broadcasts could be linked to the frequency of ceremonial visits by high U.S. officials, progress on proliferation to military cooperation and progress on prison labor exports to Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization. Perhaps other links could be found that would make Beijing more eager to permit Red Cross visits and release prominent dissidents.
These loose linkages need not insist on perfect performance, merely good-faith efforts measurable by results. Meanwhile, none of the new links should be interpreted to preclude actions that directly serve obvious American interests, such as holding high-level talks on North Korea.
If Mr. Clinton is at all serious about defending human rights in China, Cabinet officers like Mr. Brown need to use their private meetings to convince Chinese leaders that the quality of their relations with the United States will in part depend on how they treat their own people.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Cuban Overture

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Will the principle that guides Clinton Administration domestic policy also be applied to foreign affairs?
The bedrock principle, as it has evolved from Bunker Hill to the White House bunker, is this: Don't run until you see the whites of their eyes. 
 Using this key, readers of prognosticatory harangues in this space were able to discern beforehand the passage of the Republican-deporked crime bill, as well as the President's sudden willingness to let Congress go home to mull over ever-less-toxic health legislation.
Now let us apply it to the mini-crisis precipitated by Fidel Castro. Like Marshal Foch at the Marne, with his center giving way and his flanks collapsing, the nemesis of modern American Presidents has dispatched from his teeming shores the refuse Communism made wretched.
Castro used this technique of immigration aggression and dissident-dumping on Jimmy Carter successfully 14 years ago. In 1994, however, the U.S. President properly chose to defend our border.
The determined Clinton reaction set hard-liner hearts to racing. He interdicted the pitiable raft armada at sea; he reversed a policy that automatically granted Cuban economic refugees the asylum of the politically persecuted; he turned Guantanamo into a Cuban colony under American protection; he tightened the embargo of three decades by cutting off the flow of hard currency sent in by relatives in the U.S.
That's a vigorous response to aggression, at once harsh and humane and expensive, the foreign-policy equivalent of a 1,400-page comprehensive health plan. Now comes the reaction to his swift reaction.
Democratic accommodationists, led by Chris Dodd in the Senate and Lee Hamilton in the House, argue that Clinton is playing to Castro's hands by martyring him. They would go along with the dictator's demands for normalization of relations.
Republican hawks like Senator Richard Lugar, forgetting that the Reagan arms-race stressing of the Soviet system helped bring down Communism in Russia, also want to do business with Castro. They see Cuban Communism's demise in a wave of trade and tourism and cultural exchange, although that approach hasn't quite worked in China.
Everybody worries about riots in the holding pens, led by Castro's implanted provocateurs, which would cast Americans in the role of Israelis abusing Palestinians in camps.
Mr. Clinton, observing the charge of the detenteniks begin, does not yet see the whites of their eyes. Instead, he feels the heat from the Cuban-American community, led by stalwart anti-Castroists, and worries about losing the State of Florida to a Republican tide if he caves in too quickly.
That is why we see "mid-level" talks beginning, limited "strictly" to the topic of immigration. In time, these will escalate to upper-level exchanges at the U.N. or Guantanamo, or semi-private intercessions under a cigar smoke screen (Jimmy Carter's bags are packed), on what our diplomats will call "a wider range of bilateral concerns."
Before allowing Castro to extort an end to the embargo in return for taking back his refugees, however, Mr. Clinton needs to show some muscle elsewhere (the equivalent of his firm stand against assault weapons in the crime bill).
This suggests the October Non-Surprise, the multinational, multicultural, multimedia invasion of Haiti, with air cover by CNN, with the Congressional Black Caucus in the second wave to take the surrender, and with a nice boost in the polls for Mr. Clinton before Election Day.
Then, with the eyes of his Congressional and editorial critics getting close enough to show their whites, Mr. Clinton will declare Mr. Castro to be a new democrat, whose promises of "market socialism" mean the end of Communism in our hemisphere. End of embargo, end of refugee problem, and a revived dictatorship in Cuba for Castro, who logically expects to outlast Mr. Clinton in office.
As an unreconstructed interventionist and human rightsnik, I root for our military ouster of the Haitian junta and a continued squeeze on Castro until Cuban patriots do their duty.
But if the Clinton foreign policy is bottomed on the same principle that undergirds his domestic politics, then we can soon expect to be singing "Sand in my shoes, sand of Havana . . ."

HEADLINE: PENSION CHANGES RAISING CONCERNS

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
American businesses in increasing numbers are turning away from the pension plans that have provided retirement income for millions since the Depression. Instead, they are asking workers to pay for and manage their own retirement plans -- and, left on their own, Americans are not doing a very good job of it.
For decades, the American private pension system has been dominated by plans that promise a steady benefit check from the company to the worker from retirement to death. But, with astonishing swiftness, these plans are being overtaken by 401(k) plans, which require workers to put in their own money for retirement and make their own decisions on how to invest it. 
 More than 40 million Americans now have a 401(k) plan, up from hardly any 15 years ago. Yet many workers are not setting aside enough money in such plans, they are poorly investing what they do save and are frequently turning to these retirement accounts to cover everything from medical bills to houses to cars.
The result, some say, is a crisis in the making. As corporate paternalism is replaced by employee self-reliance, millions of Americans could be left with insufficient retirement savings.
"For many retirees, the money won't be there, and this will have a direct effect on most Americans' standard of living," said J. Carter Beese Jr., a commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission who specializes in 401(k) plans. "A lot of participants in 401(k) plans are not doing a good job. They are not investing well and leagues of them may be retiring at subsistence levels from their 401(k) plans. That has tremendous implications for the economy."
The number of workers under 401(k) plans is expected to continue to grow sharply, while the number of workers in traditional plans falls. Already the more than 40 million Americans in 401(k) plans exceeds the 36.5 million in traditional plans. And the number of traditional pension plans has fallen by 40 percent, to 99,000, in the last four years, while the number of 401(k) plans has grown 12 percent, to 609,000.
 
Onus For Investing Changes With Plans
 At many large companies, a 401(k) is a supplement to an existing pension plan, but many of these companies are expected to limit their pension benefits and ask workers to rely more on their 401(k) programs.
Typical of Americans juggling future needs against current ones in their retirement plans is Richard Wimmer, a Chicago lawyer. With three children, Mr. Wimmer has used his plan for a loan to buy a car. But he knows it comes at a price. "I try to take loans only when the markets are bad so I don't hurt my investment returns," he said.
The 401(k) plan, named after a section in the Internal Revenue Service code that created it, has been around since 1978. In such a plan a worker puts a percentage of his or her pretax earnings into an investment account, where the money grows tax-free until retirement. Most 401(k) plans offer an array of investments, mostly mutual funds.
The 401(k) differs from the traditional pension plan in some basic ways. A traditional plan is paid for by the employer. A 401(k) plan is paid for primarily by the worker, though some companies offer a small additional contribution.
A traditional plan guarantees that the company will pay a monthly check, based on what the worker earned, from the time he or she retires until death -- however long that might be. By contrast, a 401(k) plan provides one lump sum, the size of which is determined by the amount the worker saved during his working years and how well he invested it.
In the late 1980's the 401(k) became more popular as employers sought a low-cost way of offering retirement plans. And workers like them also, for the fact that they can watch their investments grow -- in contrast to pension plans, where the dollars multiply invisibly. In addition, unlike corporate pension plans, which require that workers stay for five years to receive future benefits, the 401(k) allows workers to leave for another employer at any time and take the money with them.
For many small employers, the choice often comes down to offering a 401(k) plan or nothing. For about 16 million Americans, mostly at smaller companies, the 401(k) is their sole retirement plan. With half of the American work force lacking any retirement plan, the 401(k) looks good.
"The cold, hard reality of 401(k) plans is that the companies used to pay for retirement plans and now the worker does," said Roger Hurtog, chief executive of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a leading money management firm. "In a corporate plan, you were assured of a retirement payment. Now it is totally up to you. Workers have lost, big time."
Added Eric Russell, a director at the Frank Russell Trust Company, an investment counselor: "401(k) plans are not all they are cracked up to be. They offer employers a way to get off the liability hook for pension plans. And the people these plans are designed to help don't understand the magnitude of responsibility they've been handed. Until they understand this, 401(k)'s won't work."
 
Scaling Back 'Dinosaur' Plans
 Traditional pension plans, of course, are still alive and well at large corporations, especially those with unionized workers. And there is overlap: fully 97 percent of large corporations offer not only a traditional pension plan but also a 401(k) plan, according to a Greenwich Associates survey of 1,100 such companies.
Still, only about 15 percent of all American workers have the luxury of two plans, according to the Labor Department. And while many large corporations are not eliminating their pension plans, the trend is toward limiting them, by reducing benefits or capping cost-of-living increases, for example, and improving the 401(k) plan.
"Corporate pension plans will be dinosaurs," said David Ball, a Washington lawyer who served as an Assistant Secretary of Labor in the Bush Administration. "They will still be around. But no one is creating any new ones, and gradually their significance will diminish."
For instance, at the Dayton Hudson Corporation, a large retailing company, the pension plan has recently been scaled back to cap payments for the highest-paid workers, and the 401(k) plan has been improved with a bigger matching contribution.
"Corporate pensions are the last vestiges of paternalism," said Fred Hamacher, vice president of compensation and benefits at the company. "Workers are having to do more for their retirement on their own. We've tweaked our formula slightly more toward the 401(k)."
"There is a very distinct shift," said William Hubert, manager of corporate benefits at the Polaroid Corporation, which has two plans, but is contributing more to its plan that includes a 401(k). "The company can't do it all. It's no longer realistic to expect to work for 30 years and then retire comfortably for 30 years on a corporate pension. Today, we have to share, and there is much more emphasis on encouraging the worker to save for himself."
 
Not Enough Money And Bad Investing
 Some companies, mostly small ones, have replaced their traditional pension plan with a 401(k) plan. Other young companies are choosing 401(k) plans over traditional pension plans. One example: Tellabs Operations Inc., a telecommunications equipment manufacturer in Lisle, Ill. "We're a young company, with a young work force," said David Southard, the company's director of human resources. "We decided to let them make their own retirement decisions."
As an employer, the Federal Government is also part of this trend. In 1984, it made its pension plan less generous and expanded its 401(k) plan. That arrangement now covers the more than half of Federal workers who were hired since then.
But as 401(k) plans grow, concerns mount. Too few workers, especially young and lower-income workers, are putting away enough money. And higher-paid workers -- those who earn more than $64,000 a year -- who may want to put aside more money cannot because of Federal limits. What is more, at all income levels, people are making bad investments and pulling out too much money for loans.
In contrast to the professional money managers who invest for a traditional pension plan, many workers continue to shun stocks, the investment that has best outpaced inflation during the last 50 years. Instead, many favor lower-yielding investments like money market funds that may not provide enough for their future needs. Or, workers buy the stock of their own company -- in spite of exhortations to diversify their holdings into a broad array of investments.
For example, 80 percent of all new dollars flowing into Texaco Inc.'s 401(k) program, which has 18,000 employees, go into either Texaco stock or money market funds. While these may seem safe in the short run, they are the riskiest choice in the long term, providing neither diversification nor protection against inflation. Only about 20 percent of the Texaco dollars go into an array of mutual funds that investment professionals say are better suited for retirement planning.
At the Xerox Corporation, nearly 60 percent of the $1.5 billion of employees' 401(k) money is invested in bond investments, often with low yields. And 70 percent of the 401(k) money at Public Service Electric and Gas Company in Newark is in a low-yielding guaranteed investment contract, a form of annuity. These investment decisions came in spite of programs at Texaco, Xerox and Public Service Electric and Gas aimed at educating employees about wise investments.
And employers report that conservatism has nothing to do with salary or schooling. For instance, even Michelle Varnhagen, a Senate staff member giving advice on the nation's pension policies, has most of her 401(k) money in a cautious Treasury-bill fund. "It's hard to find the spare time to think about how to invest my money," Ms. Varnhagen said.
 
 
Withdrawals Deplete Workers' Nest Eggs
 Equally troubling is the tendency of workers to pull money out of their 401(k) plans -- either as loans or as outright withdrawals. More than 38 percent of workers switching jobs took money out of their 401(k) plans and spent it, according to the Employee Benefits Research Institute. And the demand for loans from 401(k) accounts has been so strong that some companies, including Public Service Electric and Gas and Texaco, have had to limit loans to two per worker.
"Probably most disturbing is the large number of people who make withdrawals from their 401(k) plan for frivolous things, like buying a car," said Richard Quinn, director of corporate benefit planning and services at Public Service Electric and Gas.
Some argue that the loan provisions should be eliminated. "Why should our tax system subsidize people who use their 401(k) money to buy boats and cars, and that's what they are doing," said Robert Wuelfing, president of Access Research, an investment advisory firm.
Others, however, have more pressing reasons for the loans. For instance, Sandra Smith, a sales supervisor at a Baltimore insurance agency, took out a loan on her 401(k) account this year to pay her daughter's medical bills and to cover moving expenses. "I needed the money now," Ms. Smith said. "I'm 28 years old and far from my retirement years. I didn't think that taking a little bit today would hurt at retirement."
And rates of participation among lower-paid workers and young workers are disturbingly low. At the Marriott Corporation, only 35 percent of the company's hourly workers put money in the company's 401(k) plan, compared with 70 percent of management employees. "The hourly workers often don't have enough money to put aside," said Deborah R. Iwig, a personnel vice president at Marriott.
As a result of these trends, many are painting a bleak picture for the future. If workers lack enough money to retire, they may refuse to. To cut their work forces, many corporations may then have to pay their older workers more to get them off the payroll.
"If there is not enough money in 401(k) plans, a lot of workers will stay working," said Howard Fine, a partner at Hewitt Associates, an actuarial firm. "And the fact that people are living longer means they may have to retire later, or that others will have to be taxed more to cover them."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 30, 1994, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about changes in retirement plans misspelled the surname of a top executive at the money management firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. He is Roger Hertog. The article also misstated his position. He is the president, not the chief executive.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Advice That Employees Often Ignore"
 
START EARLY: Start participating in the plan as early as possible. The earlier you start, the more you will have for retirement. Plan ahead by estimating how much you will need for retirement.
 
CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR LIMIT: Invest as much as you can afford, up to the annual limit, to take full advantage of the tax benefits and any employer match.
 
DIVERSITY: Maintain a diversified investment program that includes stocks for growth, bonds or guaranteed investment contracts for income, and short-term money market-securities for safety. Your company stock should not represent the bulk of your stocks because a single stock is riskier than a diversified portfolio.
 
GO FOR GROWTH: If you have a long time until retirement - more than 10 years - and can accept moderate risk, place primary emphasis on common stocks, which have historically provided superior returns. They are the best inflation hedge over the long term. Avoid being too conservative.
 
HOLD THE COURSE: Maintain your investment program throughout up and down cycles of the stock and bond markets. You'll do better than by trying to time the markets.
 
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE INFLATION: If you are approaching retirement, you should still have growth potential in your plan to guard against inflation after you retire. Even a 4 percent rate of inflation cuts the purchasing power of a dollar in half over 20 years.1

HEADLINE: Change Begins at Home In Hamilton Fish District

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Aug. 23

 BODY:
For as long as anyone can remember, a Hamilton Fish has represented the mid-Hudson River region in Congress. The family traces its conservative roots to the nation's birth.
This year, with the incumbent Hamilton Fish having decided not to seek a 14th term in the House of Representatives because of poor health, the dynasty may end. If it does not, there will still be a major change. The Hamilton Fish currently seeking the seat, the incumbent's son, is a Democrat. 
 Last week, Hamilton Fish Jr. received his father's endorsement in the Sept. 13 primary. Representative Fish has declined to back any of his seven fellow Republicans in that primary.
Two other Democrats are seeking their party's nomination.
 
Changes in District
 New York's 19th Congressional District, once heavily Republican, is much more balanced since the 1990 redistricting that extended its southern border deep into Westchester County. All of Putnam County and parts of Dutchess and Orange counties make up the rest of the district, which now encompasses 113,400 registered Republicans, 91,200 Democrats and 87,000 unaffiliated voters.
The first Democrat to seek the Congressional nomination was Dennis Mehiel of Armonk, a businessman and a former chairman of the Westchester Democratic Party.
Mr. Mehiel, who has contributed $250,000 to his own campaign and expects to raise an additional $300,000 to pay for radio and television ads, took aim at Mr. Fish in one of his first television ads.
"Hamilton Fish Jr. owned a magazine that printed anti-Semitic articles and said, 'Hey, don't blame me. I'm only the publisher,' " the ad said.
 
Article by Gore Vidal
 The magazine was The Nation and the 1986 article, by Gore Vidal, attacked the publisher, Norman Podhoretz. Mr. Mehiel said that the article "portrays Jewish-Americans as not owing their first loyalty to America, the country of their citizenship, perpetuating a charge that has been leveled against Jews over the centuries."
The charge of anti-Semitism created a stir in the district, with the backers of Mr. Fish saying that the article was not anti-Semitic and that it was fair comment in a journal of opinion.
"Negative campaigning is offensive and turns off voters," Mr. Fish said. He added, "The voters in this district will reject the message and the messenger."
Mr. Fish, who no longer publishes The Nation, is now a senior adviser to Human Rights Watch, which monitors 70 governments around the world to enforce compliance with human-rights standards.

 
Shift to Economic Issues
 Although the Mehiel ad is still being shown, he and Mr. Fish are focusing on economic issues in the district, particularly the widespread layoffs among white-collar workers.
Mr. Mehiel campaigns on a platform of economic renewal and job creation. He says he worries that young college graduates and those trained for other jobs "cannot raise their own families where they grew up" and he proposes Federal tax credits for job creation.
Mr. Fish favors Federal assistance in expanding new technologies and exploring new global markets, as well as simplifying the paperwork required of business and easing of credit.
This is not the first time that Mr. Fish, who lives in Garrison, and Mr. Mehiel have faced each other politically. They lost a three-way primary for the 20th Congressional District in 1988 to Nita M. Lowey, who went on to defeat the Republican incumbent, Joseph J. DioGuardi.
 
A Change of Plans
 The third Democrat seeking the nomination, Neil McCarthy of Lewisboro, was the party's nominee in 1992, losing to Representative Fish. Mr. McCarthy, a lawyer and former Federal prosecutor, had not intended to run again, but he changed his mind, an aide said, with Representative Fish's decision to retire.
He has the support of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. and uses house parties and small gatherings to raise money and gain political support. "My campaign is more grass roots and door-to-door than Mehiel, who has the money, or Fish, who has the name," he says.
The Republican contenders include Mr. DioGuardi, who moved into the 19th District to run for the seat being vacated by Mr. Fish. Describing himself as the most conservative candidate in the race, he urges voters to "Re-elect DioGuardi" and says his old 20th District included 200,000 Westchester residents who are now in the 19th.
Mr. DioGuardi, an exuberant campaigner, advertises himself as "the only certified public accountant to have been elected to Congress."
 
Party Worker Running
 The Republican slate includes one woman, Sue W. Kelly of Katonah, who works in a hospital as a patient advocate. She said she has been "involved for 14 years in the Republican Party, helping to put people in office." Now, she said, "I've decided to run for myself." She expects to spend $300,000 on the primary campaign.
"I'm not running as a politician, nor as a woman," she said, "but as a person caught in the same economic trap as everyone else in the region."
Guy Parisi, a Chappaqua lawyer who has long been active in Republican Party ranks, was the choice of the Westchester party chairman, Anthony J. Colavita. But despite such support, the party convention in June was unable to reach a consensus, throwing the decision into a rare Republican primary.
Mr. Parisi, a former village justice and Albany lobbyist for Westchester County, has the advantage of enlisting party loyalists to help reach the Republicans who vote in primaries.
 
Four Veterans in Race
 Four of the Republican candidates have military credentials. One is a nine-term Assemblyman, Glenn E. Warren of Fishkill, a Marine helicopter pilot in Vietnam who was shot down three times. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross twice. His political base is in Dutchess County.
Paul W. Bucha of Somers, a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, which is in the district, won the Congressional Medal of Honor in Vietnam. He says he has been involved in international finance, marketing and real estate for 15 years.
John Flanagan Jr., of Brewster, is a brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve, as well as an author, lecturer and consultant. He flew 300 missions in an unarmed spotter plane in Vietnam and was awarded the Silver Star. He is a faculty member in transportation management at St. Francis College and St. John's University in New York.
He says jobs and crime are the major issues in the district, favors military intervention in Haiti to "restore democracy," and says he offers the financial knowledge of a businessman, the vision of a professor, the leadership of a military officer and the objectivity of an author.
Another candidate, Joseph M. Corrigan of Wappingers Falls, has devoted his campaign almost entirely to the issue of servicemen missing in action in Vietnam. A former marine, he has played a role in negotiating for their release, acting as a link between Hanoi and Washington.

HEADLINE: Home Health Care Is Gaining Appeal

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
Cheryl Corrins pulls up to the brick, split-level house of Margaret Savinis, 93 years old, a widow for 54 years and a long-retired cook. Mrs. Savinis waits cheerfully at the head of the dinner table in a nightgown and robe, in front of a centerpiece of daisies that a great-grandchild brought from his wedding.
"I come three times a week," Mrs. Corrins says, "and the nurse comes the other days. I give her a shower and once a week shampoo her hair. Take her pulse and blood pressure. Change the dressing on her ear." 
 Mrs. Savinis has skin cancer that has spread from her right cheek to her ear. To treat her, Mrs. Corrins slips on thin plastic gloves and lays out a white cloth, a cleaning solution, cotton swabs and gauze pads. She drains the lesion on her patient's ear and replaces the bandage. Then she dabs ointment on Mrs. Savinis's shoulder to relieve a burn from radiation treatments. "She's an angel of mercy, I tell you," Mrs. Savinis says.
 
Fastest Growing Job
 Mrs. Corrins, 39, is in demand these days, visiting four or five patients a day in Pittsburgh's southeastern neighborhoods. The growing demand for home care has made home health aide the fastest-growing occupation, in terms of percentage, among all those monitored by the Government, and it has helped make health care, over all, the nation's fastest growing provider of jobs.
Even without taking into account whatever success President Clinton has in trying to overhaul the health care system, the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the number of home health aides will soar to 827,000 by the year 2005, compared with 347,000 in 1992.
Home health care is one of the few growing occupations that offer workers with only a high school diploma wages approaching those of the manufacturing jobs that the nation has been losing. With training, regular retraining, Medicare accreditation and 13 years on the job, Mrs. Corrins earns $11.13 an hour, plus health benefits and 29 cents a mile for use of her car. Registered nurses earn about $17 per hour for home care, which more of them are providing.
 
No Layoffs
 Mrs. Corrins's employer is the Home Health Agency, a part of South Hills Health System, a private provider that starts aides at $9.56 an hour. It requires two years' experience, usually at nursing homes or hospitals. It also requires aides to pass a 50-question, multiple-choice test on medicine, nutrition and psychology.
The work is secure. The agency's executive director, Cathy Frasca, said that in 31 years in business "we have never had a layoff."
Home health care is growing because the old and infirm prefer their homes to institutions, said Val J. Halamandaris, president of the National Association for Home Care in Washington, a lobbying group.
In Mrs. Savinis's case, home is with her daughter, Irene Pascuzi. "I wouldn't give up my mother for all the money in the world," said Mrs. Pascuzi, a widow. "She'll never be put in a nursing home."
 
Underlying Economics
 The aging of the population also contributes to the demand. So does technology that allows patients at home to have services like intravenous feeding and chemotherapy. But the most important reason may be economic.
A day in a hospital costs about $1,500, so both the Medicare bureaucracy and private insurers push hospitals to release patients sooner. Patients can go to nursing homes, where daily costs start at about $250 and can top $500, or they can go home.
For Mrs. Corrins's patients, the usual home visit, which takes one to two hours, costs $55 if the patient pays and $52.41 if Medicare pays, as it does for 90 percent of the South Hills agency's more than 3,000 patients. The agency charges $100 or more for visits by nurses and specialists.
While home health care is less expensive than nursing home care, the Government currently helps only elderly people who are acutely sick or people who are very poor, and it tends to drive them into nursing homes. Medicare, the Federal insurance program for the elderly, pays for home aides for people who require the attention of registered nurses or other professionals. The coverage usually runs up to 90 days after the person is released from a hospital.
 
Prohibitive Costs
 Although some patients remain ill enough to keep their Medicare coverage for home health aides for years, most lose it as their conditions stabilize because their conditions are no longer deemed acute. Many private insurance companies offer home health care coverage, but the cost is prohibitive for most people.
A patient without private insurance who still needs care but who loses Medicare coverage can pay for an aide, can turn to relatives for help or can move to a nursing home. The patient or a private insurer pays the nursing home bills until the patient's savings are nearly exhausted. At that point, Medicaid, a Government program for the poor, will pick up the bill, provided the patient stays in a nursing home.
South Hills, whose aides make 320,000 visits per year, is one of the largest of the nation's 6,500 home health agencies certified by Medicare. More than 6,000 home health agencies are not certified by Medicare; they usually charge lower fees because they are not subject to Medicare standards, and their aides' training may be less rigorous. Their lower prices are attractive for people who want home care but who cannot get coverage for it, either through Medicare or private insurance.
In traveling from home to home, a home health aide provides help for an array of problems as Lillie Munnell, 39, a South Hills aide for five years, did when she visited patients on a recent morning.
 
Patients in Need
 First she saw a 73-year-old woman with diabetes, high blood pressure and arthritis in her knees, ankles and toes. She is so obese that open sores have formed in the folds of her waist, and she cannot bend to treat blisters between her toes.
Then Mrs. Munnell went to the home of Charlotte Gaupp, 86, who has osteoporosis, emphysema, a swelling of unknown cause in her abdomen and poor hearing and eyesight.
Mrs. Gaupp looked chipper. Five-feet-one and trim, she played forward on her high school basketball team, she said, and she gets around unassisted. But she prefers to stay in her chair, where she watches television and eats her Meals on Wheels.
Like all South Hills aides, Mrs. Munnell was trained by a number of health professionals, and a nurse accompanies her once a month on visits to patients. She cannot give injections or do anything else considered invasive. But she takes vital signs and specimens and gives shaves, baths and showers, back rubs and enemas. She cleans catheters, hearing aides and artificial eyes, applies bandages and topical medications and looks for signs of new ailments. She has learned to move patients from beds to shower stools without throwing out her back and to change beds with patients in them.
 
Taxing Compassion
 But there are also emotional dimensions to the work of aides.
One of Mrs. Corrins's patients taxes all of her training and compassion. George Kostek, 64, who is called Buck, retired from his job as a steel company welder when he was 42. A diabetic, he had to undergo a kidney transplant. His wife, Jean, 64, retired from her job as a secretary four years ago to care for him.
His second kidney functions perfectly, she said, but little else does. Mr. Kostek has lost his left leg and the toes on his right foot. He has pulmonary disease. A stroke three years ago left his left side partly paralyzed. He has lost the sight of his left eye, and despite laser surgery, he is nearly blind in his right. He can no longer read or watch television. A new ailment, narcolepsy, is terrifying Mrs. Kostek. "He passes out on me for no reason at all," she said.
But Mr. Kostek wants to stay where he is, and Mrs. Kostek intends to keep him there. "I don't have much of a life," she said, "but I wouldn't have much of a life if he was in a nursing home because I'd be there all the time." Her relief comes at night -- when her husband sleeps soundly, straight through -- and during the two visits a week from Mrs. Corrins.
 
A Mischievous Smile
 "Hello, Bucky," Mrs. Corrins said, coming into a room where Mr. Kostek lay in his motor-controlled hospital bed. At her greeting, his face glowed with a mischievous, untroubled smile.
Mrs. Corrins put an arm across his shoulders, took his blood pressure, soaked his face with a warm, damp towel and shaved three days of stubble. Then she prepared to bathe him.
"She makes him so comfortable," Mrs. Kostek said in the kitchen. "See how calm he is in there? When I try to give him a bath, it's like fighting."
Mrs. Corrins and her husband, a mechanical engineer, have three children, a daughter, 14, a son, 12, and a daughter, 1. "My son had leukemia," she said. "He had 15 radiation treatments, and he's been off for three years. It was a gift. Now I can deal with this."

RAISING MATH AND SCIENCE REQUIREMENTS
In two weeks, New York City high schools will begin an ambitious effort to raise the math and science requirements for nearly all its students. But there are so many hurdles -- from a lack of money for books and teacher training, to concerns about the readiness of most ninth graders for such a change -- that many parents and teachers believe the new requirements will be nearly impossible to meet. A1. 
 A similar plan to raise standards was undertaken four years ago in Brooklyn. B4.
 
STUDY CHALLENGES STEREOTYPE OF POOR
Challenging the stereotype of the poor as single mothers on welfare who soak up more and more tax dollars, a new study has found that only one in four poor households in New York City is headed by a single parent and that spending on welfare, when adjusted for inflation, has declined by 20 percent since 1975.

VILLAGE JEWELER IS FOUND SLAIN
Alfonso Albrizio was a fixture in Greenwich Village for 35 years, partly because he operated a jewelry store that became a favorite of celebrities, but mostly because of his generous heart. That ended when a man raced out of Mr. Albrizio's shop, C'est Magnifique, with a steak knife in his hand. The knife was covered with blood. On the floor inside lay the 79-year-old Mr. Albrizio, dead, his throat slashed. B3.
 
NEW IDEAS ON SUBWAY SHOOTING
Investigators looking into last week's shooting of a transit police officer are exploring the possibility that the city police officer who mistakenly fired on his plainclothes colleague was himself wounded either before he opened fire or while he was shooting. If that is true, said an official, then the city officer, Peter Del-Debbio, might have believed he was under attack. It might help explain why he continued to fire once the plainclothes officer had crumpled to the ground. B3.

HEADLINE: Sidetracking Rights, U.S. Aide Pursues Business in China

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, leading a high-level business delegation to China, has agreed to take human rights off the public agenda so he and the American corporate executives traveling with him can open a new era of "commercial diplomacy" in the world's fastest growing emerging market, American officials said today.
As the first Clinton Cabinet member to visit China since the President separated human rights concerns from trade policy, Mr. Brown has publicly avoided any statement about the deterioration of human rights conditions over the last three months or about the security clampdown that has coincided with his arrival. 
 A senior official traveling with Mr. Brown said tonight that the Commerce Secretary would undertake only "private representations" to China's top leaders about continuing rights abuses.
"Commercial engagement" is one aspect of the Administration's new human rights policy, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "One strand of human rights policy is private representations."
Tonight, Mr. Brown was able to announce the first success of his business mission. The American power-generation giant Westinghouse signed a $140 million agreement to provide the steam turbines for a 700-megawatt electrical power plant in Jiangsu Province.
Westinghouse's chief executive, Michael Jordan, is a member of Mr. Brown's delegation.
Pitney Bowes and International Business Machines sealed contracts today worth about $20 million each, delegation spokesmen said.
Mr. Brown's first full business day in Beijing included a friendly session with Prime Minister Li Peng, who greeted his American guest by saying: "We have waited a long time for you to come to China. I hope that your current visit will provide impetus for friendship and cooperation of our two countries."
In remarks carried on national television, Mr. Li also told his American visitor that China was willing to discuss human rights, but only on the basis of "mutual respect." Western diplomats say, however, that the high-level dialogue between Washington and Beijing on the fate of thousands of religious and political detainees in China remains suspended.
A senior official traveling with Mr. Brown and insisting on anonymity later said the Chinese were not so friendly when the talks got down to the dispute between Washington and Beijing over the terms and conditions for China's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Chinese officials were said to have taken a tough line against American insistence that China revamp some of its protectionist tariff and currency rules as a condition of entry.
Mr. Brown began the day by addressing a breakfast of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, telling dozens of business managers based here that "commercial diplomacy allows the United States to pursue our economic agenda of creating jobs by increasing exports and bringing down barriers."
By the end of the day, Mr. Brown had signed a set of agreements to expand the United States-Chinese Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE POLICY;
U.S. WILL PROPOSE REDUCING BARRIERS TO CUBA MIGRANTS

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration plans to ask the Cuban government to halt the exodus of boat people in return for an offer by the United States to relax its immigration rules and grant residency visas to more than 20,000 Cubans a year.
During the last year, the United States granted residence visas to only 2,700 Cubans. The low number has caused Mr. Castro to complain that it was far below the legal ceiling of 27,845 Cubans that the Administration is authorized to admit. 
 Last week, Mr. Castro asserted that the failure to grant more visas to Cubans has helped cause the mass exodus of Cubans aboard rickety rafts and boats.
Today, as the weather cleared in the Florida Straits, the flow of refugees increased again, and scores of Cubans took to their boats in the hope of being rescued by the United States Coast Guard. [Page A10.]
The new Administration offer was being prepared in advance of talks scheduled for Thursday with Cuban diplomats in New York intended to resolve immigration issues and ease tensions over the refugee cisis created when the latest exodus of Cubans began early this month.
The Administration's plan represents another twist in its immigration policy toward Cuba, this time in the form of bending immigration laws to make it easier for Cubans to enter the country legally.
For instance, it plans to grant entry to cousins and grandparents of Cuban-Americans and grant refugee status to some Cubans even if they do not meet the strict standards for asylum.
Under existing rules, the parents, children, spouses and siblings of naturalized Americans can qualify for visas, but cousins do not.
According to several officials, Attorney General Janet Reno plans to use her emergency powers under the immigration laws to raise the number of Cubans admitted each year to the legal ceiling.
To help reach the ceiling, she is also expected to allow some or all of the 19,700 Cubans who are on a waiting list for visas to jump the line and receive visas this year. Some of those Cubans, many of them brothers and sisters of Cuban-Americans, have been waiting for visas for 10 years.
Several Administration officials said they hoped that this new offer would win Mr. Castro's approval and put an end to the refugee crisis, in which the Coast Guard has picked up more than 18,000 Cubans in the Straits of Florida since Aug. 1.
"We think the Cubans need to control illegal departures and we need to facilitate legal departures," said a White House official.
Mr. Castro has long pushed Washington to expand legal immigration from Cuba, partly because it would help serve as a safety valve for discontented Cubans to leave the island.
In 1984, the Reagan Administration agreed to grant visas to up to 20,000 Cubans a year. Immigration laws that went into effect in 1990 raised the ceiling to 27,845.
"We are going to recommit to that number and be more precise about how to get to those figures," a senior Administration official said.
The officials said that Ms. Reno and Doris Meissner, the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, are developing additional ideas to be presented Tuesday at a White House meeting on how best to raise the number of Cubans accepted each year to the ceiling.
 
Fear of Favoritism
 The United States and Cuba agreed to meet on immigration after the Clinton Administration requested the talks to resolve the current refugee crisis. Mr. Clinton has steadfastly refused to discuss topics other than immigration at Thursday's talks even though Mr. Castro has called for negotiations on a wide range of subjects, including the 31-year-old trade embargo against Cuba.
One fear that Administration officials said they have about their new offer is that other ethnic groups like Chinese-Americans or Haitian-Americans will protest that the Cubans are being granted preferential treatment. The Immigration and Naturalization Service currently has a list of 3,442,000 foreigners awaiting visas, some of whom have waited for 10 years.
Still, one senior Administration official said, "For 30 years, we've been treating Cubans differently from everyone one." Under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, the Administration welcomed all Cubans who arrived on American shores. But on Aug. 19, Mr. Clinton, fearing a flood of Cuban refugees, ended that policy and decided to send Cubans intercepted at sea to the naval base at Guantanamo Bay.
A senior State Department official said, "I've been assured that whatever steps we take regarding Cubans will in no way delay the admission of anyone else."
 
Castro's Response Unknown
 Administration officials acknowledged that they were unsure whether Mr. Castro would agree to stop the exodus of rafts in response to the proposal.
Still, there was hope that Mr. Castro would accept the offer because it might earn him some goodwill with the United States, perhaps encouraging the Administration to discuss easing economic sanctions.
"If he wants a debate in this country on Cuba policy, he has to act responsibly," said a senior Administration official.
Another factor that could push Mr. Castro to accept the offer, officials said, is that he must recognize that the flotilla of fleeing Cubans is sabotaging his efforts to entice Western tourists and investors.
In return for the offer to increase legal immigration, the Administration also wants Mr. Castro to take back 226 refugees being held at Guantanamo Bay who have asked to return to Cuba.
The list of 19,700 Cubans awaiting visas includes 10,900 brothers and sisters of American citizens, 5,100 spouses and unmarried children of permanent resident aliens and 3,000 married sons and daughters of American citizens.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Times Picks Business Editor

 BODY:
John M. Geddes, a former national news editor of The Wall Street Journal, has been named the business editor of The New York Times, Joseph Lelyveld, the executive editor, announced yesterday.
Mr. Geddes, 42, will preside over a planned expansion of The Times's business news coverage. 
 "He's an editor who thinks strategically and starts with a keen sense of our strengths and opportunities," Mr. Lelyveld said.
Since March, Mr. Geddes has been the president and chief executive of BIS Strategic Decisions, a 300-employee market research firm.
He has also been a principal in Friday Holdings L.P., which bought BIS Strategic Decisions late last year. Friday Holdings is a media investment group formed in 1993 by Norman Pearlstine, the former executive editor of The Wall Street Journal.
As business editor of The Times, Mr. Geddes succeeds William Stockton, who is working on special projects for the executive editor.
Mr. Geddes, who graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 1974 and earned a master's degree in business journalism from the University of Wisconsin in 1976, was a general assignment reporter at Reuters and Dow Jones before being transferred by A.P.-Dow Jones to Bonn in 1978.
He joined The New York Times as an economics reporter in Germany later that year.
Mr. Geddes returned to Dow Jones in 1980 to open The Wall Street Journal's Bonn bureau. He became deputy managing editor in 1982 and helped start The Wall Street Journal/Europe, the paper's Brussels-based European edition. He was later named managing editor of the edition.
He became an assistant managing editor of The Wall Street Journal in New York in 1985 and led teams that redesigned The Journal as a three-section paper. He became the national editor in 1992 and was responsible for The Journal's inside news pages and Marketplace section. He resigned in 1993 to join Friday Holdings.

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 17.80 as It Strives for 3,900 Level

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
For a moment yesterday morning, the Dow Jones industrial average leaped nearly 30 points, before falling back and closing at 3,898.85, up 17.80 points.
The advance yesterday marked the third time in four sessions that the blue-chip index has risen, aided somewhat by stable bond prices and a steadying dollar. 
 The relatively modest rally was also the first time since mid-March that the Dow came close to 3,900, and it renewed talk among investors of another assault on a Dow of 4,000, perhaps as early as this week.
But the rise yesterday, coming after last week's surge of 125.65 points, may signal a period of husbanding the market's gains in the usually quiet week before the long Labor Day weekend.
 
Economic Reports Due
 Two sets of Government economic data scheduled for release this week, factory orders and unemployment claims, could also dampen traders' enthusiasm and thwart any significant advances. Any signal in those data of emerging inflation could erase the advances of last week, which were based on an optimistic picture of a sound economy with low inflation.
"Mostly the Dow had a nice rally last week and is now in a consolidative position," said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at Kemper Securities Inc.
Amid the generally rising tide, there were some notable stocks. Eastman Kodak agreed to sell its nonprescription drug business, which includes Bayer aspirin, to SmithKline Beecham for nearly $3 billion. Kodak's stock rose 1 3/8, to 50 3/4, while American depository receipts of SmithKline rose 1/2, to 31 1/2.
First Financial Management, a data management firm in Atlanta, said it planned to join in the bidding for Western Union Financial Services, a leading supplier of money orders and wire transfers. First Financial stock rose 1/2, to 61 1/4. Western Union's parent, New Valley, which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, does not trade.
Nextel, the most active stock, at 9.5 million shares, was a big loser. The provider of specialized mobile radio service, which is akin to cellular phone service, could not complete alliance talks with MCI Communications and Comcast. Nextel's stock fell 5 1/4, to 25 1/4.
ITT was also a big loser. The stock market had judged that ITT and its partner, Cablevision Systems, had overbid for Madison Square Garden in a combined offer valued at more than $1 billion. ITT shares dropped 4 1/8, to 82. But Cablevision shares, by contrast, gained 3/8, to 58.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell, and its yield rose to 7.49 percent, from 7.48 percent on Friday. The dollar stayed above 100 Japanese yen and remained above postwar lows. Still, it fell to 100.02 yen, from 100.67 yen on Friday, but rose to 1.5776 German marks from 1.5745 marks.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was less than normal with 266.3 million shares changing hands, or much less than this year's average of 286 million shares. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners, 1,237 to 903.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.79 point, to 474.59, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.27 point, to 763.21. The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.46 point, to 261.28, and the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.9 points, to 451.46.
Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 19 rose, led by Eastman Kodak and Union Carbide, which rose 1 1/4, to 33 3/4.
Of the 500 stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 275 rose, led by AT&T, which gained 5/8, to 55 3/8, a rise that might have been connected to the failed MCI-Nextel deal.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Prices Flat Despite Inflation Fear

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were little changed yesterday after commodity prices rose to their highest level in more than three weeks, raising inflation concerns among some investors.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 4/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.49 percent, from 7.48 percent on Friday. 
 Economic reports are scheduled for release every day this week. The main event is Friday's release of the August employment report, which for months has been the economic indicator that has moved the market most. Traders said many investors would wait for that report before making investment decisions.
Bond prices fell after the Commodities Research Bureau index of 21 commodities rose slightly, according to James Kenney, head trader at Prudential Securities. The index rose 1.14 points, to 232.02.
While the rise was small, it was enough to push the index to its highest level since Aug. 4, when it reached 232.45. Higher commodities prices cause investors to worry about inflation, which diminishes the value of fixed-income securities such as bonds.
Higher oil prices also raised concern about inflation. The crude oil contract for October, the most active contract, rose 49 cents, to $17.63, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
At the same time, the dollar fell 0.65 yen, to 100.02 yen. A weaker dollar discourages overseas investors from holding financial assets denominated in dollars, like Treasury bonds.
The dollar's retreat "killed off the rally here," said Bruce Hillyer, a trader at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. "We're still just locked onto the dollar."
The small moves in other markets were enough to stop bonds from extending an advance on Friday in part because activity was light ahead of the Labor Day weekend, traders said.
"Because of the volatility in the foreign exchange markets and oil prices and C.R.B. and other things, the optimism of Friday seems to be somewhat reversing itself," said Robert G. Alley, chief fixed-income investment officer at AIM Management Group, who oversees $3 billion in investments.
Earlier, bonds rose amid speculation that the Federal Reserve may buy as much as $4 billion in Treasury securities this week. Bond firms generally bid up prices when they know they have a ready buyer of a large block of securities.
The Fed is expected to execute the "coupon pass" today or Wednesday, Steven Saslow, executive managing director at HSBC Securities, said. That could lift Treasuries, he said.
In a coupon pass, the Fed buys securities for its own account to ease a seasonal shortage of reserves in the banking system. Without the buying, short-term interest rates would be higher than the central bank wanted. A pass does not signal a change in interest rates.
Bonds were not affected by a Government report showing that personal income rose a half percentage point in July, as expected. Spending rose two-tenths of 1 percent, the Commerce Department said. Both income and spending rose for the third consecutive month.
The report is "consistent with the economy remaining on a moderate growth trend," said David Cohen, an economist at MMS International in San Francisco.
"We're pushing the economy toward capacity," Mr. Cohen said. A higher inflation rate is bound to develop if the current pace of growth keeps up, he said.
On balance, the August employment report "probably will be negative" for bonds, said Robert McGee, chief economist at Tokai Bank. "All the indicators suggest the labor market remains quite strong," he said.
Yet the Government's reports will not reflect an economy so robust that bond yields will fluctuate much from 7.5 percent, where they have been for 11 weeks, Mr. McGee said.
The following are the results of the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.835	97.508	Discounted Rate	4.61%	4.93%	Coupon Yield	4.73%	5.13%	High Price	98.842	97.513	Discounted Rate	4.58%	4.92%	Coupon Yield	4.70%	5.11%	Low Price	98.832	97.508	Discounted Rate	4.62%	4.93%	Coupon Yield	4.74%	5.13%	Accepted at low price	18%	34%	Total applied for	$48,770,681	$48,691,578	Accepted	$12,274,611	$12,245,505	Noncompetitive	$1,364,550	$1,243,115	
 
Both issues are dated Sept. 1, 1994. The three-month bills mature on Dec. 1, 1994, and the six-month bills mature on March 2, 1995.

HEADLINE: U.S. Incomes Rose 0.5% Last Month

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29

 BODY:
The income of Americans rose moderately but more rapidly than consumer spending did in July, the Government said today in a report that indicated that economic growth was slowing.
The Commerce Department said today that income climbed for the sixth consecutive month, advancing five-tenths of 1 percent, while spending rose for the third consecutive month, but by just two-tenths of 1 percent. 
 Disposable income -- income after taxes -- also rose five-tenths of 1 percent last month. Both income and disposable income had risen one-tenth of 1 percent in June. Income last fell in January, by six-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Series of Increases
 Consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of economic activity, has advanced five of the last six months. But the July rise was less than the gains of five-tenths of 1 percent in June and six-tenths of 1 percent in May.
Today's report points to an economy that is shedding momentum, at least partly in reaction to a series of five increases in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve this year, analysts said.
"There is no overheating here," said Paul Boltz, an economist at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. "The bounce-back in income was impressive. Income growth is easily exceeding inflation."
The July figures for spending and income generally were in line with analysts' expectations.
The combination of incomes and spending meant that Americans' savings rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable income -- was 4.1 percent in June, up from a revised 3.7 percent the previous month. The Commerce Department had previously put the savings rate for June at 4 percent.
Wages and salaries, the most closely watched component of income, increased $15.3 billion in July after a $5 billion rise in June.
Government wages and salaries rose $1.6 billion in July, after declining $1.5 billion the previous month because of a drop in buyouts for Government employees.
Spending on long-lasting items declined 1.1 percent in July, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $579 billion as car buying slowed.
"Consumers have become more cautious about making significant commitments such as cars," said Sung Won Sohn of the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "The trend has been established in both housing and autos."
Spending on nondurable goods, like food and fuel, rose three-tenths of 1 percent, to $1.393 trillion, and spending on services was up four-tenths of 1 percent, to $2.648 trillion.

The booming personal computer industry defies economic gravity.

BYLINE: By John Markoff 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
THE personal computer boom just won't quit. Wall Street analysts expect a new sales surge to drive up computer companies' stocks during the second half of the year.
In June a number of Silicon Valley insiders were quietly betting that Apple Computer Inc. was about to take a fall. The rumors were that huge cutbacks in orders for disk drives signaled that the computer maker, based in Cupertino, Calif., was sitting on a sizable inventory. 
 But Apple, the world's second-largest PC maker after Compaq Computer, confounded the skeptics with strong third-quarter results. Now it looks as though Apple and much of the rest of the industry are headed for an unusually strong second half.
Apple's stock, which lost 37.5 cents yesterday to close at $35.375 on Nasdaq, has risen this year but is still 3.125 points below its year's high set in March. Some analysts say it could rise as much as 20 percent by the end of the year.
As educational institutions place their computer orders for the new school year, late summer is proving to be a time of strength, and it is likely to be followed by a strong-looking Christmas season for both Apple and its competitors. "The personal computer is becoming a stocking stuffer," said John T. Rossi, an industry analyst at Robertson Stephens & Company.
The PC industry's remarkable strength is bucking broader trends. Economists predict that the economy's strong growth since the fourth quarter of 1992 will moderate in the second half of the year.
"Over all, consumer spending has been very strong," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities. But, he said, sustained growth of the economy above 3 percent will probably not last. "I would imagine the economy will start to slip as we move into 1995," he said.
Besides Apple, both Compaq and Hewlett-Packard are showing remarkable strength. The PC business at Hewlett-Packard, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., has grown about 100 percent this year over last, David Wu, a computer industry analyst for S. G. Warburg, said. Compaq, based in Houston, has grown increasingly bold, telling analysts that it believes it can raise its market share to 30 or 35 percent by 1996, in part by cutting prices. Compaq now has a 14.3 percent share of the computer market, according to Dataquest, a market research firm. Its stock gained 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $39.875, and its year's return has shot up 122.86 percent.
Earlier this month Compaq cut prices on some systems by as much as 22 percent. Indeed, Compaq's target is largely I.B.M., which responded last week by cutting prices up to 27 percent.
I.B.M., however, seems to be the one PC maker that may miss out on the end-of-the-year sales surge. Although the company briefly took the No. 1 spot in PC market share last year, it has since stumbled to fourth place behind Packard Bell, and its United States PC revenue declined in the most recent quarter. International Business Machines lost 50 cents yesterday, closing at $69.50.
Wall Street analysts predict that in the December quarter, PC purchases could exceed 20 million, setting a quarterly record, in large part because the home PC market is projected to grow to about 16 million in 1994, from 11 million in 1993. Indeed, more than half of all home PC sales for the year are expected to come after Sept. 1. "The new personal computers have all the attributes of classic consumer electronics products -- color, sound, stereo, fun and games," Mr. Rossi said.
The surge is not limited to home PC's. Intel will ship its top-of-the-line Pentium microprocessors in the fourth quarter and that should drive down prices for business-system buyers who have been waiting to upgrade.
Pentium-based systems are falling below $2,000, spurring demand, according to Andrew J. Neff, a PC industry analyst at Bear, Stearns.
He said in a recent newsletter that falling prices for PC's would finally spur the consumer market in Europe, which has been largely dormant compared with the United States.

Report on German Economy Strengthens Dollar vs. Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended slightly higher against the German mark and most other European currencies yesterday after an influential report on Germany's economy suggested that interest rates there might fall.
The dollar advanced initially against the Japanese yen in Asian and European trading on optimism for progress in trade talks between the United States and Japan. Also helping the dollar was an American economic report showing that personal income rose moderately last month, providing little evidence of new inflationary pressures. But much of the strength faded later and the dollar ended lower against the yen. 
 Foreign exchange traders described activity as light, with a financial holiday in London reducing the volume. The slow trading might have exaggerated the dollar's moves in either direction.
In late New York trading, the dollar brought 1.5776 marks, down from its high for the day of 1.59833 marks but higher than 1.5745 marks at the close of trading on Friday.
The dollar also fetched 100.02 yen in late New York trading, down from 100.67 yen on Friday.
 
Weakness in the Mark
 Traders said much of the activity focused on weakness in the German mark after the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Germany's central bank could lower key interest rates there to stimulate the economy without accelerating the inflation rate. Lower interest rates in Germany would lessen the attractiveness of mark-denominated investments.
"After that news we started buying the dollar," said Zlatko Glamuzina, senior trader at the New York branch of Banco di Sicilia, an Italian bank.
He said the strength in the dollar intensified as traders who had speculated on weakness in the dollar after its big run-up last week scrambled to buy dollars to cover their short sales. Once the dollar surpassed 1.59 marks, however, dollar sellers moved in.
"It turned into an overbought situation when we went over 1.59 marks," said Peter Dembinski, senior trader at the New York office of Bank Julius Baer. He said the dollar "probably could consolidate around these levels."
Early in the day, the dollar gathered strength against the yen after the Japanese Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, said he was confident that Japan and the United States would solve their trade disputes through negotiations. The dollar has tended to weaken on rumors that those negotiations could falter and strengthen on word that they might succeed.
Meanwhile, the British pound rose to $1.5366 in New York, from $1.5315 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Jobs Versus Inflation at the Fed

 BODY:
Alan Blinder, recently appointed vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board by President Clinton, called last week for the Fed to use monetary policy to bring down unemployment from temporarily high levels. That prescription put him at odds with Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony to Congress that the Fed cannot control employment and ought to focus only on inflation. The difference at first blush seems stark: one man worried about jobs, the other about prices.
Mr. Blinder's declaration may have been designed to enhance the likelihood that the White House would elevate him to the Fed chairmanship when Mr. Greenspan's term expires in early 1996. But the statement should have come as no surprise: he preached the same doctrine as an academic and before Congress. Indeed, it is Mr. Blinder's dovish stance on inflation that made him an attractive appointment to a White House that desperately seeks to create jobs. 
 The dispute is real, but easy to exaggerate. Mr. Greenspan, too, is worried about jobs, which he believes are best created by wringing inflation completely out of the system. Both economists agree that the Fed cannot drive unemployment below current levels, about 6 percent of the labor force, without doing damage. According to both men, if the Fed were to pour money into labor markets that tight, wages would rise and drag prices and interest rates along. Eventually the Fed would be forced to stamp out the rising inflation by changing course -- clamping down on the money supply and thereby throwing the economy into a job-destroying recession.
Yet there are circumstances that could bring the differences between the two to the surface. Suppose, for example, that inflation rose above current levels while unemployment climbed toward 7 percent. Mr. Blinder would probably advocate pushing down interest rates in an attempt to spark investment spending and, therefore, more jobs. But Mr. Greenspan would argue that Mr. Blinder's policy would backfire because bond markets can anticipate that the Fed is about to trigger higher inflation and therefore demand higher interest rates, the opposite of the result Mr. Blinder intended to achieve.
The important point, however, is that their policy prescriptions are unlikely to prove greatly different in practice. Neither economist is a zealot. Mr. Greenspan has skillfully steered the economy along a path of non-inflationary growth by guiding monetary policy, no matter what he tells Congress, with an eye on employment as well as prices. Mr. Blinder says he is an inflation dove, slow to raise interest rates to combat inflation, but he voted to raise interest rates earlier this month even though inflation rates remain very low.
Mr. Blinder was able to do so without jeopardizing jobs because he recognized that unemployment was hovering around 6 percent, which is about as low as the economy can sustain over the long haul. Had the Fed refused to intervene with higher interest rates, inflation would almost surely have picked up by the end of the year.
When Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Blinder summarize their theories of intervention in the economy, neither sounds convincing. Neither Mr. Greenspan's sole focus on inflation nor Mr. Blinder's willingness to worry about inflation only after the economy hits capacity is a complete answer. But Mr. Blinder is surely right that the Fed must be concerned about employment, and it does not hurt for the nation's assembled bankers and economists to be reminded of that.

HEADLINE: Redlining Under Attack

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
While the Justice Department's settlement with the Chevy Chase Federal Savings Bank of Maryland was the first of the Clinton Administration's attacks on redlining to gain wide notice, it represents only an early salvo in a multifronted assault. Both the Department of Housing and Urban Development and an interagency committee of banking regulators are working on broad new Federal requirements for more lending to minorities, and the costs will likely be spread among all borrowers, banking specialists say.
A stricter regime on mortgage discrimination has long been a goal of many Congressional Democrats, and Clinton Administration officials have called for progress, not paperwork, on the issue. But the pragmatic case for an aggressive approach hinges on the assumption that mortgage discrimination is widespread. And on this point, some economists are raising serious questions. 
 Most of the analysts who are dubious about the assertion that redlining is a fact of life make their argument on the ground of economic efficiency.
George J. Bentson, a specialist in financial regulation at Emory University, finds it implausible that banks would pass up any chance to issue mortgages that could be sold for a quick profit in the securities markets. "There is no evidence of significant discrimination in mortgage lending," he said.
Others, including Lawrence J. White, a former Federal bank regulator who teaches economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University, worry that using statistical patterns to infer discrimination -- the general mode of proof in such matters -- will induce lenders to allocate funds by racial or neighborhood quotas rather than by creditworthiness.
"Such targeting is bad public policy because it wastes capital," Mr. White said. "If we are going to subsidize lending for social purposes, it ought to be done explicitly and with Government money."
But other analysts question the statistical patterns as well.
A recent study by David Horne, an economist at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, concludes that the seminal redlining study, conducted by Alicia Munnell, a former economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston who is now a deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, was fatally flawed. His analysis of the data shows no discrimination at all.
Redlining -- avoiding banking in low-income neighborhoods -- and discriminating by race are forbidden by a host of Federal laws. Under the Fair Housing and Equal Credit Opportunity acts, the Justice Department in the last two years has reached settlements with banks in Mississippi, South Dakota, Massachusetts and, earlier this month, in the greater Washington area.
In the past, redlining cases involved charges that that lenders unfairly rejected loan applications. In the Washington-area case, the department said that Chevy Chase Federal Savings, with $5 billion in assets, was guilty of refusing to market itself in minority neighborhoods. Chevy Chase strenuously denied the allegation and said it had settled to avoid costly litigation. Under the settlement, the savings and loan will offer loans to minority applicants that will cost it $7 million in subsidies and open new branches and mortgage offices in poor neighborhoods.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development is working on a new lending code, to be published next month, that will ask the 2,900 members of the Mortgage Bankers Association to pledge that they will aggressively seek business among minorities. And Federal bank regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Controller of the Currency, are drafting tough regulations against redlining under the authority of the Community Reinvestment Act.
These battles should prove easier to win than antidiscrimination initiatives in employment, education or housing. For while the banking industry may quietly lobby against greater social regulation, banks are reluctant to resist publicly -- and for good reasons.
For one thing, bank regulators have enormous discretion in ruling on applications for mergers, the opening or closing of branches and expansion into new financial services. And they have the obligation to consider a bank's responsiveness to community needs in evaluating these applications.
Then, too, banks are loath to fight high-profile battles against discrimination charges because of the bad will it generates. That could explain why of the antidiscrimination cases investigated by the Clinton Justice Department all have been settled out of court, said James D. McLaughlin, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association. Similar logic could be used to account for the apparent compliance of the industry with the lending code the housing department is negotiating with the Mortgage Bankers Association.
 
Plan Will Be Voluntary
 The agreements between the department and individual lenders, which will include dollar targets for minority-area lending and statistical analyses to measure compliance, will be voluntary. But according to The American Banker, a trade publication, the financial trade associations are telling their members that signing up will buy them friends in high places.
Much of the pressure for a tougher enforcement effort stems from data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1990. The data show that black and Hispanic applicants are two to three times more likely to be turned down for a mortgage than whites.
Those data, however, have been criticized by the banking industry for what they do not show. Race, it is argued, is correlated with employment and financial assets -- information that should legitimately be considered in evaluating loan applications. So in 1992 the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston decided to fill in the missing pieces.
The Boston Fed's effort, led by Ms. Munnell, looked at a large random sample of mortgage applications in the Boston area. The researchers included data on employment, age, family stability, neighborhood stability, personal debts, credit histories and size of requested loans compared with house values -- all of which might have explained why nonwhites were rejected in disproportionate numbers.
 
Explanation in Part
 These factors do, in fact, explain part of the discrepancy. Even so, the researchers concluded that black and Hispanic applicants with equal qualifications were 60 percent more likely to be turned down by lenders. Highly qualified applicants, black or white, had no trouble getting credit, saidLynn E. Browne, one of the study's authors. The problem came with marginal applicants; bank loan officers apparently proved more willing to work with white clients to find offsetting factors that would open the credit window.
The Boston study and its conclusions have had enormous influence on regulators' views. Lawrence B. Lindsey, a governor of the Federal Reserve, called it "the most comprehensive statistical analysis of lending patterns by race that has ever been conducted."
But in an article published this spring in the F.D.I.C. Banking Review, Mr. Horne, the F.D.I.C. economist, took another look at the Boston Fed analysis. He concluded that adding yet more information relevant to loan decisions -- for example, the availability of cash for closing costs -- wiped out three-quarters of the discrimination found in the Boston Fed's study. What's more, Mr. Horne said, if one eliminates data from two minority-owned banks that actively solicited business from marginally qualified blacks, the evidence of discrimination vanishes entirely.
With or without evidence, what is the harm to increased vigilance? The answer, economists argue, depends on whether lenders respond by funneling capital into unproductive projects.
While bank regulators have apparently rejected formal statistical tests as a standard for judging compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act, banks can certainly use numbers to ward off the regulators. And the H.U.D. guidelines will reportedly ask lenders to pledge to lend minimum amounts in minority neighborhoods.
 
Impact of Incentives
 It is possible, of course, that the incentives will only make lenders more aware of the profit opportunities in neglected areas. The consequences of such lending, said Geoffrey Tootell, a co-author of the Boston Fed study, "may be less inefficient" than current lending decisions colored by bias.
But it is also possible that banks will find that the path of least political resistance is simply to shovel enough money into minority projects to make the regulators go away. "These costs would then be passed on to creditworthy borrowers of all races," Mr. Horne said.
That is why Mr. White of New York University would rather see socially motivated investments made with public funds -- say, through community investment banks. "If we are going to push money around," Mr. White said, "I'd rather the decisions be transparent and the results open to public scrutiny."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 31, 1994, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An economic analysis in Business Day yesterday about the Clinton Administration's efforts to curb mortgage discrimination misstated the current position of Alicia Munnell, the former chief economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston. Ms. Munnell is now the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, not the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget.

HEADLINE: How U.S. and Russia Can Reduce Nuclear Peril;
Steadfast on Smuggling

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Nuclear Black Market" (editorial, Aug. 22) charges that the Clinton Administration has been giving nuclear smuggling only "fitful attention." Far from it. The Administration has identified stemming the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as one of its key security priorities. We have worked at the highest levels, and with our allies, to coordinate strategies for controlling the spread of nuclear material. 
 Preventing diversion of fissile material is part of our overall strategy to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation. We have long cooperated with German authorities on reported nuclear-smuggling cases, and they are keeping us informed of their investigation of last week's case.
Through the Nunn-Lugar program for the safe disposition of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union and other programs, the Defense and Energy Departments and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission cooperate with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan to account for, control and protect nuclear materials.
Louis J. Freeh, Federal Bureau of Investigation director, has been in touch with his counterparts to improve law enforcement cooperation with European states affected by smuggling. The Customs Service is working with the Russians to facilitate information sharing, leading to joint investigations.
To help reduce excess stockpiles, the United States contracted with Russia to purchase power reactor fuel blended down from 500 metric tons of highly enriched uranium from dismantled weapons. And Vice President Gore and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin signed an agreement to shut down the last three Russian plutonium reactors by 2000.
In July, President Clinton achieved agreement with the leaders of the Group of 7 leading industrial nations and Russia to cooperate in preventing nuclear smuggling. Secretary of State Warren Christopher spoke with his European colleagues last week to reinforce this agreement, and we are aking steps to facilitate the exchange of nuclear-smuggling data.
The Russians understand the importance of this issue and have been forthcoming in cooperating with us and other countries in combating this threat, as demonstrated by their agreement with Germany. We expect that this subject will be an important topic at the September summit.
Nuclear smuggling will continue to receive the serious and high-level attention it deserves, using a coordinated strategy and drawing on the expertise and talents of senior United States officials.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
For a China Boycott

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
On just one issue, President Clinton, American business and the Chinese Communist leadership have taught the people of the United States three nasty lessons.
The issue is human rights. It is a pallid phrase for what it means: freedom, or at least some surcease, from torture, forced labor and deprivation of the right to speak and worship as we are moved. 
 The question now is what Americans can do, as individual members of a free society, to override their instructors. The answers stare at us: stockholder action, and boycott.
President Clinton taught his lesson by betraying promises he made with his mouth while campaigning and with his pen after election -- to use higher tariffs on Chinese goods to pressure Beijing into human rights relief for Chinese and Tibetans.
Thus he taught the world that his word on human rights cannot be trusted, even when he puts it on paper. Since this is an issue that touches the whole world, the cause of wars throughout modern history, it is a matter of moment and danger.
How can Mr. Clinton preach human rights in Cuba as a reason for the embargo, and be believed, after reneging on a pledge to use a much milder economic weapon against China's greater tyranny?
How can he denounce ethnic cleansing in the Balkans and close his mouth and heart to Beijing's moving Chinese into Tibet and Tibetans out of their homes -- a continuing atrocity almost a half-century old?
The second lesson, from American business, is that Chinese and Tibetan blood and pain do not count on the bottom line. American business in China sups eagerly with the Devil. American executives, a planeload, are now at table, ushered in by Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown to make deals, without reference to human rights.
When the issue was higher trade tariffs, the China trade said no and won. Then human rights supporters in Congress suggested targeting only products of the industrial empire of the Chinese Army. Mr. Clinton and U.S. business said no -- and won.
Now human rights groups ask business for a code that would show some smidgen of interest about labor conditions in China. From the Administration and business, no action.
Writer, haven't you learned that business is business? Sure, but I learned at school and at home to kind of admire America, so it was just hard for me to believe right away that so many U.S. businesses would be so cold and so craven.
Lesson three. Beijing taught us that the Clintonian and business argument that more trade would mean more human rights in China was false.
Human rights groups and American correspondents report that persecution of dissidents and clergymen has increased pointedly since Mr. Clinton dropped the tariff threat.
The Chinese Communists are creating a system in which controlled capitalism and tyranny work together -- familiar from Hitler to Saddam. Spare us Washington's pout of innocence.
But if Washington and American business do not care that their country and companies help finance torture cells, what can an individual American do about it?
Two things, together. Use the stockholder's right to demand a rights code for every U.S. business investing in China. It worked on South Africa.
And in combination, boycott across the board: shoes, toys, tools and the thousands of other exports to the U.S. that give Beijing its $30 billion annual trade bonus from America.
The China lobby, the Administration and even some human rights people will say it will just get Beijing mad; forfend. But cutting down that huge trade advantage even by some annual billions will be the first economic pressure for human rights applied to China by Americans.
Beijing will at last face the choice between easing oppression and seeing its essential trade balance wither.
Combined with stockholder pressure on American corporations, backed by American labor and preached in American churches and temples, a boycott could buy some liberty for persecuted Chinese dissidents, workers and clergy.
One sure thing: It would show more rights achievement than today's appeasement policy. That stands at zero, and getting lower.
The boycott would be an act of individual conscience, the answer to the old question: But what can just one person do? At least we would not be wearing stained clothes, and that would be good.

HEADLINE: New Game for Pequots: Party Politics

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 29

 BODY:
The Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe, having earned millions from the gambling business at its Foxwoods casino in Connecticut, is investing its profits in a new game: politics.
As the November elections approach, Pequot money is flowing across the country in abundant and increasing amounts, to Albany and Hartford as well as Des Moines and Sacramento. And virtually all of it is going to Democrats.
In just the last few months, the tribe -- whose roughly 300 members are expected to earn about $600 million from the casino this year -- has given $100,000 each to the Democratic Party organizations in New York and California and $50,000 to the state party committee in Iowa, all at the direction of national party leaders. It has pledged $250,000 for other state campaigns still to be named. And with total donations of $315,000 over the last two years, it has become one of the single largest contributors to the Democratic Party's National Committee, joining the ranks of huge corporations like Time Warner and big unions like the National Education Association.
What all this means, for the Pequots and the Democrats, is an open question.
Lobbyists and lawyers for the tribe say that Democrats have been good to the Pequots, and American Indians generally, and that across a broad spectrum of issues, from health care to education, the tribal council believes that the Clinton Administration is on the right track. Local Democrats helped the tribe gain Federal recognition in the 1980's -- an old debt that can now be repaid -- and Mr. Clinton held an American Indian summit at the White House in April that was viewed by the Pequots as symbolically significant.
And while some critics grouse that the tribe is only furthering its economic interests as the owner of a huge gambling enterprise, there is little evidence of a Pequot agenda.
The Republican National Committee has offered no comment on the donations or the tribe. Democratic officials in the states getting money say they have had no contact with the tribe, and in the states closest to the casino -- Rhode Island and Massachusetts -- where the tribe would presumably have the keenest interest in influencing debate about gambling, the Pequots and Democrats say there have been no contributions at all.
But people in both parties say that the tribe has found a quick way to become a player in the game of politics. While the size of contributions to individual candidates is limited, the tribe can give as much as it wants to the state and national parties, gaining the maximum good will from party leaders.
"I would imagine that all they're trying to do is expand their influence," said State Senator James T. Fleming, a Connecticut Republican and an opponent of casino gambling. "As long as it's legal, I don't see anything wrong with it."
In Connecticut, the tribe formed a political action committee in July that could under state law give unlimited amounts to candidates. Tribal lawyers said they were also considering forming a national PAC.
Earlier this month, Carrie Saxon Perry, a former Mayor of Hartford and a Democratic candidate for the State Senate, held a fund-raiser at the casino, on the tribe's reservation in Ledyard. Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark, a third-party candidate for governor, plans to do a star turn there next month, at a $250-to-$500-a-ticket fund-raiser in a hotel ballroom.
 
Expanded Lobbying Efforts
 The tribe has expanded its lobbying efforts, too. It opened a Washington office this year, and a in Hartford this spring its largess surpassed even that of Stephen A. Wynn, the Las Vegas casino developer who has spent millions in Connecticut over the last few years to try to end the Pequots' monopoly on casino gambling in the state. The Pequots paid a Hartford public relations company $210,000 through mid-June, compared with the $152,000 spent by Mr. Wynn on lobbying, according to the State Ethics Commission.
Experts in American Indian affairs said that many tribes have long had political action committees, and that political contributions have gone up in the last few years. But the Pequots, if only by their grand scale of doing things, still get the attention.
And like all of their previous efforts to test themselves and their newfound economic sovereignty -- from the expansion of land claims to the development of a Pequot legal code -- the new flexing of political muscle is also sparking anxieties about where the tribe is going and what it will do when it gets there.
A lobbyist for the tribe, Charles J. Duffy, said that those "sensitivities" had led the tribal council to take what state elections officials say is an extraordinary step: the Pequots will limit contributions to local candidates from its new state PAC, even though it does not have to.
Mr. Duffy said the tribe would consider donations to Democratic and Republican candidates, but will hold donations to the same maximum allowed for business PACs, which can donate only up to $5,000 to a gubernatorial campaign and $500 to an individual state legislative race, with a $100,000 cap on all contributions.
"We don't want people who are averse to the tribe to be making egregious claims about what the tribe is doing and what it intends to do," Mr. Duffy said.
That has not stopped people from questioning, however, why a small tribe would ship its money so far from home.
"It is my belief that any sound-thinking person would ask why, in this case, an Indian nation would send a significant donation to a political party or elected official in another state," said State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Westchester County Republican who asked this month for a Federal investigation into the Pequots' $100,000 contribution to the New York Democratic Party.
Mr. Spano, an advocate of casino gambling in New York, said in a letter to the United States Attorney General, Janet Reno, that the State Legislature's defeat in July of an amendment legalizing casinos came within days of the tribe's donation, and that the appearances and timing were questionable, though he had no direct evidence of any wrongdoing.
Chris McNeil, a tribal lawyer who heads the Washington lobbying effort, said the Pequots had had absolutely no contact with New York Democrats, and that the state committees that have received money were all suggested by the Democratic National Committee as places where Democrats could use extra help this year.
"There's no connection," Mr. McNeil said, referring to the gambling issue in New York and the tribe's contribution.
Still, party officials in Iowa and California said that even though the Pequots' national political agenda is vague, their ability to write big checks has not gone unnoticed.
 
Keeping Track of Friends
 Mike Monasmith, a spokesman for the California Democratic Party, said the money had come with no strings attached, but that, if only to protect itself, the party always knows who its friends are.
"We are sure to make sure we know where they money is coming from," Mr. Monasmith said.
In Iowa, Democrats said the Pequots had asked for nothing in exchange for their $50,000 donation.
"We have some good Congressional races and a good chance of knocking out a Republican governor, but how that ties in to the tribe's agenda, I'm not certain," said Ron Parker, a spokesman for the Iowa Democratic Party. "We have no contact with the Indians."
Here in Connecticut, where the tribe clearly does have an established agenda -- to keep non-Indian gambling operations out of the state -- politicians said they hoped the new Pequot PAC would be low-key about any kind of loyalty pledge.
"It should not be a single-issue PAC and I don't think it will be," said Edward L. Marcus, the Connecticut Democratic Party chairman. "I'm not sure that would make too many candidates all that comfortable."

HEADLINE: Researchers Find a Diverse Face On the Poverty in New York City

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Challenging the stereotype of the poor as single mothers on welfare who soak up more and more tax dollars, a new study has found that only one in four poor households in New York City is headed by a single parent and that spending on welfare in the city, when adjusted for inflation, has declined by 20 percent since 1975.
In fact, the report, released yesterday by the Citizens Budget Commission, found that Medicaid, not welfare, had been the prime engine of growth in public spending on the poor in the city, particularly in the exploding costs of medical care for the disabled and the elderly poor. 
 In 1992, the most recent year studied, expenditures by the city, the state and the Federal Government for Medicaid in New York City amounted to $10.2 billion, far more than for any other antipoverty program and about three times as much as the total spending on welfare and food stamps combined.
The authors of the study say the results raise questions about whether government spends too much on medical care as compared with food, shelter and other basic needs. Runaway health care costs and eroding welfare benefits have skewed spending toward the elderly, and away from children in poor families, they say.
Citing United States census figures, the researchers noted that nearly one-third of the city's children lived in poverty in 1990, while 13 percent of the elderly were poor.
"Certainly the elderly are taking up the lion's share of the poverty spending," said Philip Thompson, an assistant professor of political science at Barnard College. He conducted the study with Charles Brecher, research director for the budget commission and a professor of public administration at New York University.
The budget commission, a nonprofit city government monitoring group that usually focuses on financial matters, decided to venture into the poverty debate after the 1992 riots in Los Angeles. The commission's trustees decided that the riots showed the dangers of ignoring the dispossessed, said Ray Horton, president of the commission.
The portrait of the poor that emerges in its report, "Poverty and Public Spending Related to Poverty in New York City," is a varied one. One-quarter of poor households were headed by single parents. Another quarter were headed by an elderly person, one in five consisted of single adults, one in six were headed by a disabled adult and one in eight by a couple.
"I certainly would have guessed a larger portion of households were single-parent families," said Mr. Brecher, who had previously specialized in the financing of city government, not in poverty. "The extent to which different kinds of households were represented among the poor was news to me."
The researchers also report that the poor are ethnically varied, though clearly minorities are disproportionately represented. Among poor households, 31 percent were headed by blacks, 28 percent by non-Hispanic whites, 20 percent by Puerto Ricans, 14 percent by others of Hispanic heritage and the balance by people from other minorities. Almost half the poor households headed by an elderly person were those of non-Hispanic whites.
 
Variance Among Boroughs
 The profile of the poor varied widely by borough. In the Bronx, which has the city's highest concentration of poor people, more than one-third of the poor households were single-parent families. In Manhattan, the largest group of poor households -- 30 percent -- consisted of single adults. In Queens, households headed by the elderly made up the largest group, representing 26 percent of the poor.
The study noted that government cash payments to the elderly lifted most out of poverty. In 1990, the poverty rate among households headed by the elderly would have been 63 percent without Social Security and other cash benefits. With those benefits, only 21 percent were classified as poor.
But a negligible number of poor families were lifted above the Federal poverty level by welfare payments. Because welfare is so politically unpopular, lawmakers in New York State and elsewhere in the country have refused to increase welfare payments to keep up with inflation.
As a result, between 1970 and 1992, the inflation-adjusted dollar value of welfare benefits in New York City declined by 30 percent, to $2,206 per person, according to the report. In 1992, overall spending on welfare in the city was 20 percent lower than in 1975 after adjustment for inflation, while the number of families on welfare increased by 6 percent during the same time.
Like many others who have studied the growing phenomenon of homelessness among families, Mr. Thompson suggests that the declining value of welfare payments to poor families is closely connected to their inability to pay the rent.
 
New York Is Typical
 Despite the Dickensian contrasts of wealth and poverty in the city, the study also found that the New York metropolitan area was about average nationally in the proportion of its households that were poor -- 11.7 percent. The diversity of the city's poor people was also mirrored in the national data.
Mr. Brecher said he had assumed that all social problems were different or worse in the New York area, and was surprised that it was actually quite typical in most ways.
The researchers did find, however, that poverty in the New York metropolitan area is more concentrated in the city than in every other large metropolitan area except San Antonio, making the contrast between city and suburb more pronounced than in other parts of the country. More than two-thirds of the New York metropolitan area's poor population live in the city itself.
In 1992, the city spent $4.8 billion of its own money on the poor, about 28 percent of all locally financed spending, the commission found. Each year from 1970 to 1992, the proportion of local spending devoted to the poor ranged between 25 and 29 percent.
From 1985 to 1992, the city-financed portion of Medicaid spending more than doubled, to $2.1 billion, about 45 percent of total city-financed spending for the poor.
The rapidly rising city spending on Medicaid highlights the importance of the city's push to have the state take over local Medicaid costs, Mr. Brecher said.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE NEXT WAVE;
Cuban Refugees Resume Exodus Despite Warnings

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAVANA, Aug. 29

 BODY:
After a lull over the weekend, scores of Cubans launched fragile boats and rafts from beaches along the coast today, heading for international waters in spite of American warnings that they would not be permitted to enter the United States.
One after another, and then by the dozens, rafts began appearing in the water in front of Havana's oceanfront, known as the Malecon, and a few miles east at Cojimar, which has become the main launching point for those who want to escape from Cuba. Many of the Cubans had been camping on the beaches for days, waiting for the weather to improve.
Trucks also began arriving, depositing people who had come from Alamar in the east and Pinar del Rio in the west, 120 miles away. The trucks carried boats that the refugees had been building at their homes. Because of the current in the Florida Straits, the coast around Havana is the best launching area for the mostly unpowered boats.
Hundreds of well-wishers lined the beaches near Havana as the exodus resumed.
 
A Weather Predicter
 No one has been able to predict the flow of refugees, but the weather has been one prognosticator, even better than pleas by Fidel Castro or President Clinton.
Indeed, there has been less science and method involved in how many people have left than there has been strong emotion, including anger at Cuba's economic deterioration and impatience to get on with what everyone knows is a perilous journey.
[Despite the ample evidence that the number of Cubans leaving was rising sharply, relatively few were picked up by the Coast Guard. As of 10 P.M. Monday, 253 Cubans had been intercepted, up from 84 on Sunday. Last week, in the first rush, the Coast Guard picked up 13,600.]
"Tell my mother that I have gone and that I am very happy," Marbel Betancourt Gonzalez said just before she jumped into the turquoise waters of Cojimar to scramble onto a rubber and wooden raft with 10 others. Miss Betancourt, who had slept on the beach for nine days waiting for her journey, turned to face the crowd of hundreds of people piled on a crumbling sea wall, and with tears in her eyes she waved and blew kisses.
It is impossible to predict how many Cubans will leave in this wave, but today's activity indicates that the United States policy to deny them automatic asylum will not keep many people at home.
In fact, some of the Cubans say there is an urgency about leaving now.
Two brothers, Felipe and Jesus, came from Pinar del Rio, about 125 miles west of Cojimar, to leave from Cuba in a boat that they had assembled by soldering together pieces of aluminum, then painting it over with tar and padding the inside with plastic foam.
"We're afraid Mr. Castro is going to say, 'No more,' so we have to leave now," Jesus said. "We came here because this is the closest point to the United States, and it is a good place to launch a boat."
The brothers also said that on their stretch of the coast the Government's coast guards still seemed to be patrolling the waters. At Cojimar, there were only a few soldiers in camouflage uniforms, and they did not seem to bother the people leaving.
 
First Boat Leaves
 The first boat to leave this morning from Cojimar was a tidy contraption of rubber and wood. It, too, had come on a truck, and it had a wooden rudder and a bow made of aluminum, with lines of thin rope on its perimeter for its passengers to hold onto and a jaunty red yachting flag atop its rough-hewn mast.
One by one people boarded the boat, as hundreds of well-wishers gathered on the littered beach to see them off. A festive atmosphere pervailed. Vendors were selling tamales and guanabo turnovers. The only ones not laughing were the six women and nine men who pushed off, rowing at the direction of an older man who was clearly their captain.
Some people were dispensing advice. One man told a would-be refugee how to judge how far his raft was from tankers that navigate the straits. He told him to hold his hand out in front of him in a fist, with his thumb sticking skyward, and to close one eye. "If your thumb covers the whole tanker, then he's 10 miles away," the older man told the younger one.
Some carried good-luck charms on board. One boat had the Virgin of Charity on its bow. One refugee tried to take his dog on the raft, but the animal ran down a dock away from him.
Ramon Perez Lara, who is 61, was at the beach helping his son Sergio, who would be making about his 30th attempt to leave. The two men personify the debate about whether it is better to abandon Cuba or to stay and make it better.
Mr. Perez fought in the revolution. His family grew tobacco and corn on their small parcel of land, but the inequities of life before Castro's rule left the countryside poor of many things Cubans now have, he said.
"I learned to read and write after the revolution," he said proudly.
But his son, Sergio Lara Caras, has felt let down by the revolution. He made his first attempt to try to leave Cuba on a home-made boat five years ago, when he was 29, and he has been trying ever since. Twice he was picked up by Soviet tankers and turned over to the Cuban authorities.
He has been in prison three times for his so-called treasonous crimes, and has served as long as eight months. He has gotten as far as 35 miles out to sea, far short of the 90 miles to Florida.
"Castro has turned my struggle into something political by saying I am betraying the country," Mr. Lara said. "But it is only economic. This country does not have opportunities for me anymore. Because I have been arrested for trying to leave, I cannot get the kind of work that will help me have a life."
With tears streaming down her face, Berta Serrano Belot waved from the beach to a raft carrying her oldest daughter, 30, and her youngest son, 18.
"For a mother this is the biggest pain in my entire life, to see my children leaving," said Mrs. Serrano, holding a granddaughter's hand.
Another daughter's husband was also on the boat, along with others from their town of San Miguel del Padron, about a three-hour bus ride from here. They had come to Cojimar as a family 12 days ago, and had camped on the beach.
They spent their days scavenging for bits of lumber and other material to build their boat. They bought what they needed with the money they got from selling many of their possessions back home. They had only a few pesos each day to buy bread.
But finally today, those who wanted to go were on their way.
"I never thought my children would abandon me, but the ruin this country has fallen into has created such misery and hunger that it has forced them to go," Mrs. Serrano said, her voice trembling.

HEADLINE: Luxury Car Fight Turns Uncivilized

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Some blame the sport-utility vehicles, others the higher income taxes on the very wealthy. Some claim "90's values" have made the rich self-conscious, while still others argue that fears of health care cost-cutting have made doctors miserly.
Whatever the reason, the luxury car market, roughly defined as cars costing more than $25,000, or about 13 percent of car sales in the United States, is in turmoil, and the calfskin gloves have come off. 
 No longer do the luxury marques attract customers by simply coughing politely and drawing attention to their burled walnut. These days, the once genteel divisions are publicly taking potshots at each other, and even competing -- heavens! -- on price.
Amid the din, they are rushing to develop less expensive cars, build new plants and branch into new models like fancy trucks and roadsters in a bid to catch up with their customers' rapidly changing tastes.
"We're in a dogfight," said John O. Grettenberger, the vice president for General Motors who is general manager of its Cadillac luxury division, adding a bit archly: "Some of the competition has gotten down to a level that I would never want to see at Cadillac." The reason, he said, is simple: "Everyone's got a lot of cars."
Within the luxury segment, in which buyers perhaps most closely identify cars with the nationalities of their makers, the momentum has shifted. As a category, imports are doing well. But after big losses to the Japanese in the late 1980's, the Germans and Swedes have gained back some ground, while some of the Japanese -- in particular Toyota's luxury division, Lexus, and Honda's luxury division, Acura -- have struggled.
Sales of luxury cars in the United States are up by 4 percent over last year, but they are lagging behind the rest of the robust auto market. In particular, sales of cars costing more than $35,000 are slack, for several reasons. Conspicuous consumption, the luxury car makers grumble, is out. Further, most luxury cars' price tags are too high for executives made anxious by widespread corporate restructuring.
As a result, less expensive cars with all the options but no luxury badge, like the new Mazda Millenia and the forthcoming Toyota Avalon sedan, are drawing buyers who in the past might have paid $40,000 for a little more prestige.
The most unexpected blow to luxury sales, however, has been the popularity of four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicles like the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Ford Explorer. That shift has been a boon to the Big Three auto makers, because they make the most sport-utilities.
Such vehicles, auto industry analysts say, remain decorous enough for country-club parking lots, while carrying a rough-and-ready, back-to-nature cachet. It does not hurt their appeal that these vehicles cost less than most luxury cars.
Sales of luxury cars tend to be the most profitable for the auto makers, so the slow pace hurts. In reporting its second-quarter earnings last month, G.M. said slower-than-expected Cadillac sales had undercut the results.
 
'A Captive Audience'
 The Big Three are still searching for a way to halt the slide in their share of the luxury market. Both Cadillac and the Ford Motor Company's luxury division, Lincoln-Mercury, have had little success attracting younger, more affluent buyers.
"Their focus has been on a captive audience -- the same captive audience for 20 years," said Susan Jacobs, president of Jacobs & Associates, a consulting firm in Rutherford, N.J.
Hit hard by the last recession, older luxury buyers remain more pessimistic about the economy than younger Americans, according to Cadillac's research. Many are retired, so low interest rates have bitten into their incomes. And Cadillac has found that its older buyers are uncomfortable with leasing, which importers have successfully used to prop up their sales.
Lexus, whose sales and market share have slipped this year despite a jump in July, appears to be a victim of its success at shaking luxury buyers' habits. Many auto makers scoffed in the mid-80's at the idea of a Japanese luxury auto maker, but Lexus quickly proved that customers would flee the traditional luxury marques for cheaper competitors of equal or superior quality.
"People are less hung up on marque," said Maryann N. Keller, auto analyst with Furman Selz in New York. "Lexus educated them."
 
A Climb in Prices
 It also educated the German auto makers. "When it came to price and value, we were a little out of whack," said Michael J. Jackson, executive vice president for marketing, service and sales of Mercedes-Benz of North America.
But Lexus's prices have climbed steadily, partly because of the strength of the Japanese yen. BMW and Mercedes reacted by lowering or at least maintaining some prices. They also became more sensitive to Americans' tastes -- dampening road noise, for example, and adding cup holders.
"The industry has had five years to try to match Lexus," said George E. Borst, the group vice president for Toyota who is general manager of the Lexus division, in a meeting with reporters here last month.
But, he acknowledged, "Our products are priced above where the market is." Customers want luxury cars priced at or below $35,000, he said. But 60 percent of the Lexus models cost more than that.
As the 1994 model year comes to an end in September, the lowest-priced Lexus, the ES300, costs $31,200 -- 19.3 percent more than its introductory price of $29,250 in 1992, according to an analysis by Ms. Jacobs. During the same period, the price of the lowest level Mercedes -- the C class -- has risen 2.2 percent, to $29,900, from $29,250, even though Mercedes introduced an all new version for 1994.
 
'Water Over the Dam'
 To help buyers over the initial price hurdle, Lexus dealers are running advertisements that stress the resale value of the cars. While luxury advertising has traditionally eschewed negative attacks on the competition, one of the new Lexus ads shows a Mercedes atop a dam.
"European luxury owners are good sports about the high cost of owning their cars," the commercial begins. "To them, it's just water over the dam."
The ad goes on to claim that because of its high resale value, a Lexus LS, priced at $51,200, costs at least $14,000 less to own over five years "than most European competitors in its class."
Mr. Borst predicted that vigorous cost-cutting and new products would restore the Lexus price position before long, and no one is counting Lexus out of the market. But some of Mr. Borst's competitors are clearly relishing his predicament, and they are not above delivering the occasional jab at his product line.
"They're very competent cars, no doubt about it," said Victor H. Doolan, president of BMW of North America. "But are they very exciting cars? I don't think so, and I think the market agrees with that."
In addition to fiercer competition from each other, luxury marques are trying to fend off an even stiffer challenge from outside their ranks: the sport-utility vehicle market. "A lot of the people who moved up into S.U.V.'s are people whose logical next purchase would have been a luxury car," Mr. Borst said.
 
A Move to Practicality
 Further, some luxury car owners are switching their allegiances. Gary Chefetz, a 37-year-old business consultant in Edison, N.J., recently traded in a Mercedes roadster for a Jeep Grand Cherokee with leather seats.
"It's got all the features of a luxury car and all the abilities of a car of this type," he said of the Jeep. After the snows of last winter, he decided he wanted a more practical, four-wheel-drive vehicle.
"It's not an insult to Mercedes," he added. "They don't have a competing product. If they did, I'd probably buy it."
Mercedes is scrambling to halt further defections by building a plant in Tuscaloosa County, Ala., to start producing what the company calls an "all activity vehicle" by 1997. Lexus is weighing the idea of a luxury sport-utility, but Mr. Borst said it would not have one before 1996.
By buying Rover Group of Britain earlier this year, BMW acquired the auto maker's popular line of off-road vehicles, including the new Discovery, with a base price of less than $30,000. Free to focus on its car lineup, BMW is planning to produce a new two-seat convertible roadster at a plant it is building in Spartanburg, S.C.
Even without luxury sport-utilities, the German and Swedish auto makers have made strong gains in sales and market share this year.
 
A Sleek Sedan
 Sales of Volvos, for example, have shot up almost 20 percent in 1994, as the company has recast its image to draw younger buyers. Volvos lost sales in the late 80's, as customers came to perceive them as safe but dull cars for people long on children or short on imagination.
Further, because they lacked front-wheel drive, the cars dropped off the list for those faced with the prospect of fishtailing through snowstorms.
But in late 1992, Volvo introduced a relatively sleek sedan, the 850, with an in-line five-cylinder engine driving the front wheels. The 850, with a base price of about $26,000, is also available as a wagon and now accounts for about 55 percent of Volvo's sales.
BMW's sales are also up substantially -- 12 percent for the year. The company has gained back share since the beginning of the 1990 model year, when it began paying closer attention to Americans' tastes.
Moving away from the brooding tones preferred by its home market, BMW began offering brighter colors, both inside and out. Also in deference to American tastes, it added touches of wood and began installing seats with wrinkled, rather than taught, leather.
But its most aggressive action came in pricing. For the 1990 model year, for example, the price of the 535i sedan, its midsize model, fell to $41,500, from $43,600. Since then, BMW has tried to limit price increases. Five years later, in the 1995 model year, the 535i has been replaced by the 540i, priced at $42,750.
"There was a change in values from the 80's to the 90's," Mr. Doolan of BMW said. "People are not just buying status."
Or, at least, they're not willing to pay quite so much for it. Mr. Doolan expects strong sales in the low- to mid-luxury range, but, he said, "I don't see a lot of growth over $50,000."

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE PEOPLE;
In Crisis Over Cuba, Moderates and Castro Supporters Cry Out to Be Heard

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 29

 BODY:
In meetings with the White House and in large demonstrations here, the message heard from Cuban exiles has mostly been the same: no negotiations with Cuba, out with Fidel Castro.
But heard less often are voices from other parts of the broad political spectrum among the exiles, voices often overwhelmed by the political and economic power wielded by conservative groups opposed to any dealings with Mr. Castro. They are the voices of other representatives of the Cuban-American community who advocate talks with the Cuban leader and oppose harsh measures like a naval blockade of the island, saying they want to avoid further hardship for those in Cuba. 
 The spectrum includes moderate Democrats who seek a negotiated transfer of power in Cuba, Cuban-Americans involved in humanitarian aid, and Castro sympathizers.
Moderate groups here say they are hopeful that mid-level meetings this week between the United States and Cuba about the refugee crisis will lead to broader discussions. They say tough measures like the economic embargo, which has been in effect since the Kennedy Administration, have failed to bring about democratic reforms in Cuba and that change can only come through negotiation.
 
'Bringing Democracy to Cuba'
 "I hope that the talks go beyond immigration," said Alfredo Duran, a Miami lawyer and former state chairman of the Democratic Party who last year helped form a coalition of "moderate and progressive" business executives, academics and other professionals, the Cuban Committee for Democracy.
"There's no question right now that the only way rafts are going to be stopped is when Castro stops them, but that's not going to resolve the ultimate problem of bringing democracy to Cuba," Mr. Duran said.
Most of the Cuban exiles share the goal of moving the Cuban Government toward democracy. But while the conservatives lobby for punitive measures to remove Mr. Castro from power, the moderates accept Mr. Castro for now. Trying to get rid of him, they say, would only lead to civil war or an American invasion.
Some of the exile groups that take a softer stance, like the Cuban Committee for Democracy, were formed within the last two years, partly because of the election of the first Democratic President in 12 years and partly because Cuba's economic troubles have put the country in a position to seek alternatives to Communism. But so far, the Clinton Administration seems to have consulted mostly with conservative Cuban leaders on ways to deal with the influx of refugees.
 
Warnings of Angry Reaction
 Most prominent among these leaders is Jorge Mas Canosa, a wealthy businessman who is chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation and one of four representatives of Miami's Cuban community who met with President Clinton in Washington two weeks ago. Foundation officials staunchly oppose discussions on issues other than immigration, and have warned of an angry reaction among Cuban exiles in Miami if more comes to pass.
Some experts now say that the exclusion of a wide range of views in meetings between the White House and exile leaders is another indication of how hastily the Clinton Administration's policy on Cuba was put together. After the President met with the exile leaders, he cut off cash remittances to Cuba and limited travel to the island by relatives in the United States.
"There's a large constituency that still does want to send money to their families, who wants to travel to Cuba, and at the White House there wasn't somebody there who said, 'I'm sorry, I disagree,' " said Lisandro Perez, director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University. "These are usually newer immigrants who don't have the power or the money to be in political circles."
Last week, White House officials broadened consultations and met in Miami with about 70 people representing about a dozen civic groups as well as government agencies to explain the new policies and gather local reaction. Among the Cubans in the group, however, no one advocated a dialogue with Cuba, said Jeff Eller, a White House spokesman who was in Miami for the talks. He said he did not know why other groups were not included.
 
Crashing the Meeting
 The omission so frustrated Eddie Levy and Xiomara Almaguer, who head another group that advocates negotiations, the Cuban American Defense League, that they decided to crash the all-day meeting at Miami Dade County College. Ms. Almaguer said some of the Cuban participants walked out when she began to speak.
"Everybody there was from the far right," said Mr. Levy, who also heads Jewish Solidarity, a group that sends food and medical supplies to Jews in Cuba. "If they want to listen to Cubans, they have to listen to more than one sector of the community."
Mr. Mas, of the Cuban American National Foundation, insisted that the President solicited a broad range of exile views. The group that met with Mr. Clinton included Maria Elena Torano, a Democrat who worked in the Carter Administration and now heads a management consulting and environmental services company; Cesar Odio, the Miami city manager, and Luis Lauredo, another Democrat and businessman who is coordinating Florida's preparations for the upcoming Summit of the Americas.
But Mr. Mas said there was no reason to involve those who advocate talks with Mr. Castro.
"This type of people are an insignificant minority in Miami," he said. "They reflect the opinion of the Cuban Government."
 
Petition Drive to Open Talks
 The political spectrum in the exile community does include organizations that support Havana. Last week a group of them began a petition drive in Miami and other cities with large Cuban populations, demanding that the Clinton Administration rescind its policy of detaining refugees and its ban on travel and monetary aid, and open talks with the Cuban Government.
Andres Gomez, national coordinator for one of the groups, the Antonio Maceo Brigade, said the United States had encouraged immigration from Cuba for the last three decades and was morally responsible to continue accepting Cuban refugees.
"I don't know whether that is its purpose, but the current policy is a policy of war," he said. "There has never been any indication that the Cuban Government makes concessions under pressure."
Nicolas Rios, the publisher of a monthly magazine on Cuban issues who visits Cuba frequently to meet with Communist Party workers, said, "The intelligent thing to do now is to give Mr. Castro an exit." He contends that by now the Government in Havana will be willing to negotiate "everything."
 
Looking for Alternatives
 Many of those advocating conciliation say they are just looking for alternatives to 35 years of hostility between Cuba and the United States. If the United States is willing to normalize relations with Communist countries like North Korea, he said, why not Cuba?
"The cold war is over," said Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, a former political prisoner and president of Cambio Cubano, an exile group that advocates talks with Cuba and lifting the economic embargo.
But Mr. Lauredo, one of the Democrats who met with Mr. Clinton, said the only way Cuba can become a democracy is with Mr. Castro's departure.
"There have been several attempts at negotiations in the past by Latin American leaders intervening with Castro to open up the system, and we've gotten absolutely nowhere," Mr. Lauredo said. "I believe sanctions would put more pressure on him."
As the United States deals with the influx of Cuban immigrants, some Cuban exiles here concede that they are at a loss for answers. Raul Rodriguez, an architect who is active in Cuban-American affairs, said Mr. Castro is "an unreliable negotiator" who would not keep his word, but he was reluctant to call for drastic action to bring down the Cuban leader.
"The only incentive for people to arise against Castro is to make it a fair fight," he said. "Making them more impoverished than they already are won't make them better soldiers to bring him down."
"Besides, what will be left after a civil war?" he asked. "The losers will be the Cuban people."

HEADLINE: CUTS IN MEDICARE ARE ON THE TABLE, BUT PERIL IS SEEN

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Even while spurning most of President Clinton's health care plan, members of Congress have eagerly accepted one part of the original proposal, which would take money from Medicare and Medicaid to help finance health insurance for people without coverage.
The President's dream of universal health insurance appears to be dead in this Congress. But his proposal to set stringent limits on the growth of Medicare and Medicaid is very much alive in the more modest proposals still being considered in the Senate and the House. 
 The prospect of such cuts in the growth of Medicare and Medicaid, in the absence of new benefits, alarms many beneficiaries, doctors and hospital executives, though Federal budget officials say the two programs are growing at unsustainable rates.
Lawmakers from all political camps, including Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and the Senate, rely heavily on savings in Medicare and Medicaid to pay for efforts to expand coverage.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said, "If health care reform is not enacted this year, it is as close to a certainty as there can be in the legislative process that there will be a cap on Medicaid and Medicare enacted next year."
But experts on health policy say the proposed cutbacks could have adverse effects. While the cutbacks are aimed primarily at doctors and hospitals, not at beneficiaries, the experts say that if Federal payments are reduced, doctors will probably become even less willing than they are today to care for patients on Medicare or Medicaid.
Moreover, they say, many doctors and hospitals that accept such patients will make up the lost revenue by increasing their charges to patients with private insurance. Businesses and labor unions have long complained about such cost-shifting because they pay the extra costs.
Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for 32 million elderly and 4 million disabled people, pays doctors an average of 59 percent of what private insurers pay, and the gap has been widening, according to the Physician Payment Review Commission, a Federal panel that advises Congress on payment of doctors.
Paul B. Ginsburg, executive director of the commission, said most of the health care bills pending in Congress would further increase the gap in fees paid to doctors by Medicare and by private insurers.
Medicaid, the Federal-state program for 33 million low-income people, pays doctors 47 percent of what private insurers pay. Many doctors refuse to take Medicaid patients because the fees are so low.
Several authoritative studies suggest that most Medicare beneficiaries have good access to medical care, but that there are problems for some groups, including blacks, Hispanic Americans, people who are disabled and those who live in rural areas and inner-city neighborhoods.
 
'Beginning of a Problem'
 Dr. John M. Eisenberg, chairman of the Physician Payment Review Commission, said: "The problems in access to physicians' services for Medicare beneficiaries are just below the surface. People in areas underserved by doctors, members of minority groups and poor people already have the beginning of a problem. This should be a red flag."
Vic Rosenthal, staff director of the Minnesota Senior Federation, a consumer group with 35,000 members, said that "it's difficult to find doctors who are willing to take Medicare patients" in some rural areas of Minnesota, and added, "Our big fear is that if you cut Medicare, there are likely to be fewer physicians willing to participate in the program."
In addition, Mr. Rosenthal said, the premiums that elderly people pay for private insurance to supplement Medicare may rise. The supplementary insurance, known as Medigap, pays medical expenses not covered by Medicare. There will be more such expenses if Medicare pays less, he said, so "cuts in Medicare will drive up the cost of Medigap policies."
The Congressional Budget Office said the President's original health care proposal would have cut the projected growth of Medicare by $103 billion, or 9 percent, over five years. The bills offered by Mr. Mitchell and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, would save slightly more.
While lobbyists for the elderly do not like such cutbacks, they were willing to accept them as part of a plan to restructure the health care system and to control health spending across the board. Many of the comprehensive proposals discussed this summer would have provided new benefits for the elderly, including coverage of prescription drugs and long-term care. But such benefits are less likely to be included in the more modest bills that Congress will consider when it returns from its summer recess on Sept. 12.
Mr. Clinton also proposed to limit private health spending by setting a cap on the annual growth of private health insurance premiums. Mr. Gephardt would set annual limits on public and private health spending for the nation as a whole and for each state. Insurance companies, doctors, hospitals and drug companies fiercely opposed the limits on premiums, arguing that they would lead to the rationing of health care.
There is little support in Congress for any proposal that would authorize the Government to regulate or limit private health spending. But there is strong bipartisan support for legislation to limit Federal spending through Medicare and Medicaid. The process of overhauling the health care system now looks, to some people, like an effort to reduce the Federal budget deficit.
 
Subsidies for the Poor
 John C. Rother, chief lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons, said: "The private sector has succeeded in eliminating insurance premium caps. The proposed restraints on the growth of Medicare have increasingly been used as a means of financing not only improved benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, but also the proposed subsidies for low-income people."
Under Mr. Clinton's original plan, all Americans would have had health insurance "that can never be taken away." In trying to curb Medicare payments to hospitals, he justified his proposals by saying that hospitals would no longer need to provide charity care because all their patients would be insured.
But Congress is now considering much more modest proposals that would leave millions of people uninsured. The Medicare and Medicaid cutbacks have not been adjusted to reflect that fact.
The Congressional Budget Office says Mr. Mitchell's bill would have cut $112 billion, or 9 percent, from the projected growth of Medicare over five years. A bipartisan group of about 20 senators who call themselves the mainstream coalition wants to cut the growth of Medicare by $70 billion over five years.
A measure drafted by a group of moderate lawmakers in the House, including Representatives J. Roy Rowland of Georgia, a Democrat, and Michael Bilirakis of Florida, a Republican, would trim $61 billion from Medicare over five years. Mr. Gephardt's bill would reduce the growth of Medicare by $110 billion over five years, mostly by imposing a cap on the program.
 
$56 Billion Cut Last Year
 These changes would all come on top of savings made last year when Congress approved the President's budget plan, squeezing $56 billion from Medicare over five years.
The Mitchell and Gephardt bills, like the Clinton plan, assumed that large amounts of money could be saved by abolishing most of the Medicaid program and giving subsidies to poor people to buy private insurance. The Senate coalition's proposal would also phase out most of Medicaid, on the assumption that its recipients would buy private health insurance.
But experts say such changes may be unworkable if there is no way to pool the purchasing power of Medicaid recipients and other consumers.
Joshua M. Wiener, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said: "For what Medicaid pays on average, you cannot buy a health insurance plan in the private market that covers the Medicaid benefit package. So if there are large Medicaid cuts with no comprehensive reform of the health care system, Medicaid recipients may be worse off than they are now."

HEADLINE: U.S. Pins Its Hopes on Dividing the Serbs' House

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Aug. 30

 BODY:
The United States, frustrated in its attempt to engineer a Bosnian settlement, is eyeing a new policy for ending the war: defeat or ouster of the Bosnian Serb leaders with the help of their former patron, the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic.
It is a high-risk policy -- for the Clinton Administration and for President Milosevic. But after the Bosnian Serbs' crushing rejection of an American-backed peace plan for Bosnia in a referendum, it has emerged as the only alternative to an increase in the fighting. 
 After some wavering, the Bosnian Serb rejection of the peace plan is now categorical and appears to be backed by more than 90 percent of the Serbian population in Bosnia.
"The map is history," said an aide to Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic. "It is completely and totally and utterly unacceptable. You can put it in the archives."
But for the Clinton Administration, which spent months drafting the plan with Russia, Britain, France and Germany, the map's offer of 51 percent of the territory to the Muslim-led Bosnian government and 49 percent to the Serbs amounts to a final attempt to reach what it regards as an equitable peace and will not be withdrawn.
 
Marriage of Interests
 It is in this dogged pursuit of the proposed settlement that the outlines of an unlikely marriage of interests has emerged between the Clinton Administration and its longtime Balkan enemy, President Milosevic.
The United States, bereft of alternatives, wants the peace plan to stick; President Milosevic, leading a country wearied by a long trade embargo, now wants the war he planned and backed to go away because he judges that the economic and political risks for its continuation have become too great.
Thus, for the Serbian President, as for the American, the plan is the only way out of an impasse.
But the critical question for the Clinton Administration is: how far to support, and how far to believe, the man whose vision of a Greater Serbia was the vehicle of his rise to power and the centerpiece of his hold on it before he turned on the Bosnian Serbs three weeks ago and cut them off by closing the Serbia-Bosnia border?
"Milosevic does not have a record of credibility that you would jump to accept," one American official said, alluding to an earlier Serbian embargo on the Bosnian Serbs that quickly evaporated last year. "But this time he seems to mean business. And if we are satisfied that the embargo is airtight, the possibility of easing trade sanctions on Serbia would be looked at with favor."
 
Border Is Now Sealed
 Inspections of the border by United States diplomats during the last three weeks have suggested it is virtually sealed. But officials said the Clinton Administration would not be satisfied that the frontier is "airtight" unless several hundred international monitors were allowed to station themselves on the border.
This stance has already provoked tensions with Russia, whose Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, complained today of "diplomatic inertia" and "little flexibility" among the so-called contact group of countries in rewarding President Milosevic for his new stand. Mr. Kozyrev, at the very least, wants an opening of Belgrade airport.
His desire for quick action is understandable in that the political situation in Serbia is delicate.
If President Milosevic does agree to the placing of several hundred monitors on Serbian soil between his citizens and the Serbs west of the Drina River, he will be ridiculed by his former nationalist allies, the Serbian Radical Party of Vojislav Seselj. More importantly, there could well be some muttering in the ranks of the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Army.
 
A Delicate Balance
 On the other hand, if President Milosevic resists the American demand for monitors, and is not rewarded by an easing of sanctions for having turned on the Bosnian Serbs, his political support could erode. What, his opponents will ask, have you gained by betraying our fellow Serbs?
For now, with his control of the media and his deft exploitation of Serbian weariness with the war in Bosnia, President Milosevic has kept firm control. Opinion polls that were hostile to the peace plan have suddenly turned favorable; state television now interviews lovers of peace rather than prosecutors of war.
But the fact remains that he has taken a considerable risk and headed into uncharted territory by dumping the Bosnian Serbs.
"Milosevic wants a lifting of sanctions and so he is prepared to push us into an unfavorable agreement," the top aide to Dr. Karadzic said. "In other words, he is prepared to sell the more than one million Serbs west of the Drina in order to strengthen his political situation. Our people are bitter and appalled by what he has done and if he thinks he can push our leaders from power, it is not going to work."
 
Preparing for Long War
 Certainly, the Bosnian Serbs, even isolated from Serbia, still have considerable assets: the support of the Orthodox Church, of most Serbs living outside the region, and of several opposition parties in Serbia. Moreover, even if the Bosnian Serb referendum was imperfect, it suggests a considerable unity massed behind a powerful army led by the most skillful general in Bosnia, Gen. Ratko Mladic.
"Fuel is our one problematic issue," an aide to Dr. Karadzic said. "But as Serbia has done under the embargo, we will get it at a price. For now we have strategic reserves and our sources, like the Muslims in Gorazde who sell us what the United Nations hands out to them. We are not too worried."
Clearly, the Bosnian Serbs are now preparing for a long war. For them, the peace plan is a recipe for extinction because it divides their territory into three areas and obliges them to give up crucial cities and resources.
They want the plan scrapped and a solution built around an exchange where the Muslim-led government would give up their enclaves in eastern Bosnia for territory to the north and west of Sarajevo.
"The solution lies in dividing Sarajevo and in granting international recognition to our state or entity," the senior Bosnian Serb official said.
 
Balkan Loyalties
 All this is quite unacceptable to the Clinton Administration, which therefore faces the uncomfortable task of fulfilling its promise to press for a lifting of the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims after Oct. 15. More, and more intense, war would then follow. Unless, that is, something should happen to Dr. Karadzic.
In August last year, something almost did. Junior officers in the Bosnian Serb militia staged an insurrection in Banja Luka, placing tanks on the street and demanding elections and the removal of the Karadzic leadership, whom they described as war profiteers. In the end, General Mladic managed to calm the uprising.
But links between the Yugoslav Army and the Bosnian Serb forces remain strong. If, as he appears, President Milosevic has the Yugoslav Army behind his new policy, American officials say restiveness may now exist among Bosnian Serb officers.
Moreover, these officials are not convinced of General Mladic's undying loyalty to Dr. Karadzic.
This may be wishful thinking. "General Mladic, as a professional soldier and a nationalist, is totally loyal to Dr. Karadzic," the senior Bosnian Serb official said.
But one thing is clear: if the United States is ever to pry Dr. Karadzic from his army and his commander, the only possible effective vehicle is President Milosevic.

HEADLINE: U.S. Backed on Possible Invasion of Haiti

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KINGSTON, Jamaica, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Intensifying the pressure on Haiti's military rulers to step down, the United States won support today from Caribbean nations for a possible invasion if economic sanctions and diplomatic entreaties fail.
Foreign ministers and military commanders from the 13-member Caribbean Community and Common Market backed a United Nations-approved invasion to restore the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
 Four of the seven members that have armed forces said they would contribute a token force of 266 troops to an American-led invasion force of 10,000. The Caribbean troops, from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Belize, are to begin training immediately at a United States Navy base at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico.
Britain and Argentina also promised to help train troops and to conduct military planning.
 
A Symbolic Visit
 A visit here today by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch was largely symbolic because the ministers' pledge was known in advance, and the Caribbean troops will not be in an invasion vanguard. But the public endorsement is critical to the Clinton Administration's efforts to make a credible show of force.
"Our military-diplomatic efforts are marshalled and we are determined to return democracy to Haiti with few or no casualties," Mr. Deutch said at a news conference after the meeting.
American and Caribbean officials refused to discuss the timing of a possible invasion. But Mr. Talbott said that the situation in Haiti had taken on "increased urgency" and that "there is a shared sense that the situation cannot continue very much longer."
Mr. Talbott cited the killing on Sunday night of a close friend of Father Aristide, the Rev. Jean-Marie Vincent, and the Haitian military's rebuff of an envoy from United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali who was seeking discussions with the Haitian leaders.
 
High U.S. Presence
 But American officials also said they plan to give tighter economic sanctions a chance to work before resorting to force. A multinational observer force to be stationed on Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic to help spot smugglers will not be in full operation until Sept. 13, which would seem to delay any invasion for at least several weeks.
The unusual high-level American presence at the meeting here was also intended to combat perceptions among some lawmakers and members of Father Aristide's cabinet-in-exile that the Administration had been distracted by the Cuban refugee crisis and was not fully committed to ousting the Haitian generals.
Whether Haiti's junta leaves on its own or at gunpoint, American officials said an initial force of 10,000 troops will go in to establish order; the four countries that committed troops will help monitor police activities. Guyana and the Bahamas are also considering sending troops for this first phase.
 
Last Chance for Sanctions
 Once order has been re-established, a process that Mr. Deutch said could take several months, a second force of about 6,000 troops under United Nations command would replace the American-led force and be responsible for keeping order, reorganizing the military and building a new police force. Several countries that are not joining the first force have said they will probably join the second phase.
But both American and Caribbean officials said they wanted to give sanctions one last chance. The State Department and Pentagon, however, disagree over how long to wait. Mr. Talbott, in particular, has strongly advocated the early use of military force; Defense Secretary William J. Perry leans toward giving sanctions a longer trial.
A maritime embargo and cancellation of commercial flights in and out of Haiti has brought the already weak economy to a standstill. Gasoline costs have jumped to more than $8 a gallon.
But smugglers have turned Haiti's porous 165-mile border with the Dominican Republic into a sieve, running an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 gallons of gasoline across the border daily. After the meeting here, Mr. Deutch, Mr. Talbott and Leon Fuerth, Vice President Al Gore's national security adviser, flew in helicopters over the northern border area and vowed new help to seal the frontier.
Col. William McDonough, of the United States Army, is commanding the observer group.
During the brief visit today to a forward command post in Monte Cristi, in the Dominican Republic, Colonel McDonough said the purpose of the force would be to disrupt as much of the smuggling as possible, while recognizing that there was no leak-proof sanctions.
He said the group would focus on the large tanker trucks that smugglers bring into the border towns to pick up fuel.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE SCENE;
And Still Cubans Flee: 1,300 More Picked Up

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Cubans continued their steady exodus from their homeland on handmade rafts today, making haste before political changes here and in Washington that they fear could prevent them from leaving.
The United States Coast Guard said that it had picked up more than 1,300 refugees by nightfall, a sign that the exodus was expanding after a weekend lull in which bad weather kept many from leaving. 
 Many here say they believe that a decision may be made to limit the exodus after the Cuban Government opens talks Thursday with the Clinton Administration.
This morning a flotilla of boats laden with hundreds of Cubans bobbed near the horizon, although the flow slowed as the winds picked up. Dozens of rafts continued to appear on the beach, carried there by people invariably citing the troubled economy as their main reason for leaving.
Others brought rafts to sell, with prices varying from $600 to $1,200, depending on how many inner tubes formed the body of the raft. By late afternoon, a heavy rain prompted would-be refugees on the beach to scatter for shelter.
 
The Talk Is of Hardships
 As life elsewhere in Havana continued as usual, with most people clearly making no plans to leave, those on the beaches talked of the hardships brought about by Cuba's economic crisis.
Just before the storm set in, a man in a blue polo shirt stood on the beach looking out to sea through a pair of binoculars. The man, who refused to be identified, said he was a neurologist and mentioned that two younger doctors who worked at a hospital with him had left on a raft a few days ago. "Of course this is discrediting this Government," he said. "People have always left, but not in this great a number."
Recalling the thousands who sailed from the port of Mariel in 1980 and from Camarioca in 1965, he said the boatlift was a sign that things were once again amiss in Cuba.
Curiosity, he said, brought him to the beach; he himself would not depart that way, in a flimsy boat with so much risk. At 46, he said, he does not have the time to start over in a new country with a new language.
"Perhaps I'll go to Spain," he said. "I think it would be easier for me to make a new start there."
As a doctor, he is a member of Cuba's privileged class. He has a car, he is buying his apartment and recently he took a vacation in Varadero, Cuba's premier beach resort. But he explained what a "privileged" life meant in Cuba.
He bought his car 14 years ago, at a special price as a reward for having served four years as a doctor in Africa for his country. That was before the Soviet Union cut off subsidies to Cuba, setting off an economic crisis that led to an enormous gap between wages and the price of goods.
 
The High Price of a Tire
 His car needs two new tires and a new battery.
"I earn 425 pesos a month," or about $5, he said. "New tires would cost me about 2,000 pesos and a new battery is about $60." Many of Cuba's scarcest goods are available only in Government stores that accept only dollars.
"How long do you think I have to work to buy one tire?" he said.
During his vacation, he said, "I didn't spend one peso." The Varadero resort accepts only dollars, which he does not have. "I stayed at a friend's house and we brought all of our own food."
The doctor said he really was not complaining, though, because he has much more than many of his countrymen.
A group of people stood around a simple raft made of two inner tubes piled on two others and separated by a few wooden planks. The contraption was wrapped in yellow rope netting.
Three brothers were inspecting the craft to make sure it was seaworthy. One was 18-year-old Oxaini Carlos Bascaro.
"There is nothing left for me here," he said. "There are no jobs, there is not enough food." It is a refrain heard throughout the beaches as people prepare to set out.
 
The Tourists Take All
 "Here everything is for the tourists," said Mr. Bascaro's brother-in-law, Regino Valdez, who is 25. "Cubans see none of what the tourists have access to here, not the food, nor even the music of Cuba itself."
Mr. Bascaro's sister, Osuni Abilez, had come to wish her brothers well. A gymnastics teacher at a state-run sports center, she said Cuba's economy was not offering much hope to many of its young people.
"I don't want to see them go, but they say they want the freedom to make a better way of life," she said. "All I can do is pray that they make it there, because we hear of so many people who have perished at sea."

Cutters on Patrol
 MIAMI, Aug. 30 (Special to The New York Times) -- United States Coast Guard cutters swept an area about 20 miles off Havana today, plucking people from about 50 rafts. Despite an order from Fidel Castro for the Cuban Coast Guard to stop anyone from leaving with children, some children were picked up today.
Death was also evident in the Florida Straits.
Lieut. Martha Bruner of the United States Coast Guard, who flew a helicopter today spotting rafts for the cutters, said she saw a bloated body floating face-down about 30 miles off Cuba.
"Any time you travel on a raft or a small boat it is going to be dangerous," she said, even in today's calm seas, which were free of the whitecaps and 10-foot swells of the weekend.
Instead, Cubans on rafts encountered two-foot waves and a "nice breeze," Lieutenant Bruner said. "A couple rafts had sails up and eight people rowing," she added.
The flow of refugees peaked last week when the Coast Guard intercepted an average of 2,000 Cubans each day. But as bad weather crossed the straits, just 130 were rescued on Saturday and 84 on Sunday.
"It seems like there's an upward trend here as long as the weather stays," Lieutenant Bruner said.

HEADLINE: RESHAPING THE ARMS INDUSTRY: THE GOVERNMENT;
Deal's Antitrust Issue Is Test for White House

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30

 BODY:
The proposed merger of the nation's second- and third-largest weapons makers is bound to test how the Clinton Administration can reconcile two conflicting policies: encouraging the consolidation of the military industry while aggressively enforcing Federal antitrust laws.
The combination of Lockheed and Martin Marietta -- the largest military-industry merger in American history -- would produce the second-largest aerospace company, behind Boeing, and the largest military contractor. It may also force still more mergers in an industry that has responded slowly and painfully to the end of the cold war and the rapid decline in military spending. 
 Senior officials at the Justice and Defense Departments were cautious in their assessment of the deal and said it would be scrutinized for possible antitrust problems.
"There are certain to be very serious antitrust questions about this merger," said Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch, who balanced his concern by also noting that he thought the merger "was generally a good idea for the U.S. taxpayer."
 
Close Collaboration
 Under an agreement reached earlier this year between the Pentagon and antitrust regulators that anticipated large mergers in the military industry, there will be close collaboration between the regulators and the Defense Department to study precisely how weapons systems will be affected and whether the deal will wind up costing the Government more money.
The Pentagon's recommendations will carry great weight, officials said, but the final legal determinations will be made by the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission, which began today to consider who would control the inquiry.
In letters to the Justice Department and the trade commission, Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat who heads the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Monopolies and Business Rights, criticized the merger, saying it "could be harmful to taxpayers, small business and consumers."
"If you conclude that the merger is anticompetitive and if the companies fail to act in accordance with your recommendations," Mr. Metzenbaum wrote, "I would urge you to promptly sue to block the merger in Federal court."
But antitrust lawyers said that to the extent the Government intervened, it would not be to block the deal but to require the new company to sell off certain divisions to assure competition for particular weapons. For instance, Lockheed and Martin Marietta are two of the nation's largest suppliers of classified military satellite systems, a market that Mr. Deutch said today would be re-examined in light of the merger.
For months, Defense Secretary William J. Perry has urged military contractors to carry out an orderly consolidation that preserves America's ability to develop the most advanced technology at affordable costs. But at the Justice Department, Anne K. Bingaman, the Assistant Attorney General who is head of the antitrust division, has led a division that prides itself on appearing to be more vigorous than the Republican Administrations of the prior 12 years.
The division has also opposed giving special consideration to arms makers even as the industry undergoes its largest contraction in modern history in response to 65 percent cut in Defense Department spending since 1985.
Still, some experts said today that this merger was bound to get different antitrust treatment because the Government is the military industry's main consumer, and because the issues involve national security.
 
Defense, Not Tennis Balls
 "We're not just dealing with shoes or tennis balls or steel or oil," said Prof. Robert Pitofsky of the Georgetown University Law Center, an antitrust scholar who earlier this year headed the task force whose analysis was the basis for the agreement between the antitrust regulators and the Pentagon. "We're talking about national defense."
While the law makes only a narrow exception for failing companies and no exception for companies operating in distressed industries, some industry executives and antitrust scholars have contended that the law is antiquated and should be construed flexibly. They note that the wide extent of the industrial problems created by the shrinking of such a large portion of the American economy was never anticipated.
Mr. Pitofsky said there were only three instances in more than 300 military-industry mergers in which the Government successfully blocked combinations, the most recent of which occurred in 1992, when the Federal Trade Commission stopped Alliant Techsystems from acquiring a big part of the Olin Corporation's military business. But those proposed acquisitions were significantly smaller deals than today's agreement. Short of trying to block the merger, the Government might order the companies to sell off certain divisions before approving the deal.
The most basic legal question for considering whether the merger should be approved, according to Prof. Eleanor Fox, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law, is whether the products and prices of the combined companies would be worse for the Government than they would be if the companies remained as competitors.

HEADLINE: Dole Urges Postponement For Approval Of Trade Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Only a few days after helping turn back President Clinton's vision of universal health care coverage, Senator Bob Dole has begun urging that Congress not act until next year on another issue important to the Democratic White House, a global free trade pact.
Mr. Dole, the Senate minority leader, said in an opinion article that appeared in The Wichita Eagle on Sunday that while he supported the 117-nation pact, he and his constituents in Kansas had many questions about its cost and its effects on American labor and environmental laws. 
 "We should not race to complete a major trade bill until we know what awaits us at the finish line," he said, adding that the issue could be addressed next year.
If approved by Congress, the pact would cut tariffs around the world by a third and expand the free-trade rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to cover new industries ranging from farming to accounting. A World Trade Organization would administer the new rules.
 
'Not a Political Issue'
 C. Clarkson Hine, a spokesman for Mr. Dole, said today that the Senator had taken this action because of unresolved issues concerning the trade agreement, and not from any desire to avoid giving President Clinton a political victory shortly before the November election. "It's not a political issue, it's a trade issue," he said.
But Congressional Democrats accused Mr. Dole of playing politics with a pact that, by one estimate, could add $100 billion a year to American economic output in a decade.
"I don't think there is any question that there is a political dimension to this," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, the California Democrat who is acting chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's trade panel.
 
Potential for Embarrassment
 Mr. Matsui said the United States would suffer international embarrassment if Congress did not pass the agreement this year, because the world's leading trading nations, including the United States, have informally agreed to try to put the pact in place on Jan. 1. The actual terms of the agreement, however, allow countries to wait until July 1 to adopt it and change their tariffs and trade laws accordingly.
A Clinton Administration official who insisted on anonymity said: "We have every intention of working with the bipartisan leadership and finishing it this year. We're not going to play politics with trade."
But Mr. Dole's article in The Wichita Eagle emphasized that his hostility to quick action was broadly grounded in his constituents' misgivings about the agreement. "Calls and letters have been have been flooding my office -- and I am sure my colleagues' offices, too -- on the subject of implementing the W.T.O." the senator wrote. "People are concerned."
Mr. Dole accused the Clinton Administration of not doing enough to explain to the public what was in the trade pact, which was reached last December in Geneva after seven years of negotiations.
 
Position Appears Fixed
 Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate and an outspoken opponent of free trade deals, said that Mr. Dole's reference to constituents' concerns could make it more difficult for him to change his stance later.
Ross Perot, the independent Presidential candidate in 1992, has opposed the GATT deal. He contends that the World Trade Organization violates American sovereignty, will destroy American jobs and will widen the Federal budget deficit.
Sharon Holman, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perot's group, United We Stand America, said: "We feel very strongly that you have to work out all the numbers to be sure we can pay for this."
 
Two Approaches
 President Clinton received some of his highest ratings in opinion polls following Congressional approval last November of the North American pact, which took effect on Jan. 1 and will eliminate trade and investment barriers among Canada, Mexico and the United States by the year 2009.
The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee have produced bills that use different approaches to raise the money needed to offset the $12 billion in Federal tariff revenue over five years that the world trade pact would eliminate. The House also included a provision that would allow the President to negotiate further trade agreements that could include trade sanctions against countries, including the United States, that use labor and environmental rules as trade barriers.
Mr. Dole expressed concern about both issues in his opinion piece. Mr. Matsui said that a conference of senior House and Senate members was close to resolving the issues. "If we are just given about a week or so, we can finish the conference, send it to the House and Senate floors and get it to the President," said Mr. Matsui, who is a member of the conference.

HEADLINE: 2 More Hints Of Economic Slowdown

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30

 BODY:
More signs of economic slowdown emerged today as surveys showed lower confidence among consumers and business executives.
And although the Government reported that sales of new houses rebounded more sharply than expected in July, the outlook in the industry is still for little or no growth in sales in the months ahead. 
 The two indicators join other recent data in suggesting that the pace of economic growth is slowing in the second half of the year. But it will take more significant data, like weak employment figures for August, to placate skeptical traders and investors, who say that the Federal Reserve will have to raise short-term interest rates again this year. The employment report is due Friday.
Consumer confidence, which in June reached a four-year high as gauged by the Conference Board, eased for the second month in August, the business-sponsored research group said today from New York.
"Consumers are somewhat less positive than a month earlier in their assessment of prevailing economic conditions and also less optimistic in their expectations for the months ahead," the board found. It noted "substantially less" optimism than before about the economic situation of families six months hence, with particular pessimism about jobs.
Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich is scheduled to make a major address on Wednesday about an "anxious class" of middle-income workers.
Housing industry officials took only modest comfort from an 8.3 percent jump in sales of single-family homes in July, which was not enough to fully offset June's 11.4 percent plunge, according to figures compiled by the Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development.
Rising interest rates have already bitten severely into the housing market, which was a chief propellant of growth late last year, and rates were also cited today as dampening economic prospects generally.
"The trend is still down for sales," said David W. Berson, chief economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association, who said he expects the economy to grow at a rate of 2.2 percent this quarter, compared with 3.8 percent in the spring.
The housing report, showing July sales running at an annual rate of 664,000, 2.6 percent above the July 1993 level, were as good as they were only because many buyers who otherwise would have been driven out of the market were able to turn to adjustable rate mortgages, industry specialists said.
These loans were used in 41 percent of July sales, up from 21 percent as recently as February, said Tommy Thompson, an Owensboro, Ky., builder who is president of the National Association of Home Builders. He said this had cushioned the industry as conventional 30-year mortgages climbed from a low of 6.74 percent in October to 8.62 percent in July.
 
Breakdown by Region
 The July advance was most pronounced in the South, where sales rose 17 percent, but the Northeast posted a 9.8 percent gain from a low level, and sales in the West advanced 6.5 percent. The Midwest showed a 6.2 percent decline.
At the July sales pace, the inventory of 314,000 unsold houses at the end of the month would last 5.8 months, the Government report said. The median sales price in July was $123,000, down from $131,000, a reflection more of transactions in lower-priced homes than of a fall in market prices. The average new house sold for $144,700, down from $156,900.
The Conference Board's report put overall confidence at an index rate of 89, down from 92.5 in June and 91.3 in July. Six regions declined, while three -- New England, East South Central and Mountain -- had gains. New England and the Middle Atlantic States had the lowest readings, by far.
The other reports of lower confidence came from the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.
The chamber's bimonthly index based on a poll of the small businesses slumped 6.5 points, to 49.9 in August, matching its April level. Nearly 70 percent of those surveyed said higher interest rates already had a negative effect on their businesses.
The wholesalers' index for the current quarter fell to 112.6 from 116.8, while the index for the the year ahead declined to 100.3 from 104.9.
In still another report, the Center for the Study of the States in Albany reported that state collections of sales tax surged 8 percent in the second quarter from the comparable period of 1993, adjusted for legislated changes in rates. Eighteen states had increases in double-digits.
Such revenue gains implies a robust economy during the period covered, but collections have little, if any, value in predicting future economic conditions, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Former Congressman Sets the Pace on the Road to Hartford

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WESTPORT, Conn., Aug. 29

 BODY:
John G. Rowland has been traveling across Connecticut for months now, hammering away at the four issues that he says residents want their next governor to address: jobs, crime, education and welfare.
His message is relentless. Mr. Rowland, a 37-year-old Republican who narrowly lost the 1990 election to Lowell P. Weicker Jr., is far and away the best-known candidate this time, and he wants very much to shape the race while he can. 
Unsurprisingly, all the candidates want more jobs, less crime, better schools, fairer welfare. But Mr. Rowland has most bluntly addressed the state's fragile frame of mind after years of economic trauma in its homes and gang shootings in its cities.
"The wrong people are afraid," he says. Working people fear for their jobs and their safety, he says, while criminals fear nothing.
 
A Conservative Reputation
 Mr. Rowland, who earned a reputation as Connecticut's most conservative Congressman while he represented the Fifth District, which includes Waterbury, from 1985 to 1991, has prescriptions. He says he would revitalize the state's economy by cutting state spending enough to allow the three-year-old personal income tax to be phased out.
He would make prisons places to fear, rather than "Club Meds," and would require life sentences for felons convicted of two violent crimes. Welfare recipients would have to work or undergo job training. Parents would be allowed to choose their children's schools, while the schools and their teachers would be given the means to restore order to classrooms.
The problems city schools face in educating poor children "may not have as much to do with adversity as it does with discipline," Mr. Rowland said at a campaign stop in this wealthy suburb.
Mr. Rowland, who is leading not only in the polls but also in fund-raising, with more than $1 million so far, is waging his campaign almost like an incumbent. When he schedules an event, it carries the weight of a fact-finding mission, as when he toured the East Side of Bridgeport with a police escort this month, or of an official call for action, as when he met with the Legislature's Public Safety Committee immediately after a prison riot in July.
 
An Unusual Election
 Speaking before Republican town committees, Rotary clubs and other groups, he slips in just on time, or a few minutes late, so that he has everyone's attention the moment he arrives. But he rarely seems in a hurry. Outside a Super Stop & Shop on the Post Road here, he finds few shoppers but many campaign volunteers, and he takes the time to shake hands and chat, making sure that everyone who showed up for him is noticed and thanked.
On television, meanwhile, he has begun broadcasting his first ad, vowing to make "our neighborhoods and schools safe from violent crime."
As the early front-runner, Mr. Rowland is finding his toughness and his demands for personal and governmental accountability turned back upon him by his opponents, who are many in this unusual election year. Both Democrats and Republicans have primaries, and even though Mr. Weicker is not running for re-election, his party, A Connecticut Party, is again making the general election a three-way contest.
Suggesting that Mr. Rowland's high standing in the polls is left over from his exposure four years ago, the opponents say his insistence on sticking to the four issues is an attempt to hide his record.
Secretary of the State Pauline R. Kezer, challenging Mr. Rowland in a Republican primary on Sept. 13, has attacked him as someone whose experience is as a legislator in Washington, not as an executive in Hartford, who after his defeat in 1990 parlayed his Capitol experience into highly paid consulting work for the state's largest military contractors as they laid off thousands of Connecticut workers.
 
A Sense of Discontent
 Mr. Rowland earned $392,406 in 1992 and $361,743 in 1993, including income from his family's insurance agency as well as from consulting for United Technologies, Electric Boat and other corporations.
Other opponents are concerned that Mr. Rowland will succeed in tapping the discontent that has run through the state since the income tax, which has a top rate of 4.5 percent, was imposed in 1991 in the midst of a real-estate collapse and layoffs in Connecticut's defense, banking and insurance industries.
"He gives an irresponsible expression to people's anger," said Roy Ochiogrosso, press secretary for State Comptroller William E. Curry Jr., who is facing State Senator John B. Larson in the Democratic primary. "He's very good at hitting the hot-button issues."
Richard Slawsky, Mr. Rowland's press secretary, responded: "Sooner or later somebody decides that they're behind and what they have to do is attack the front-runner. Bill Curry's in a primary with John Larson, and what does he do? He challenges John Rowland to a debate."
Mr. Rowland has said he will soon release a plan for phasing out the personal income tax, over five years. Eliminating the tax would eliminate $2.6 billion a year, more than 40 percent of the state's tax revenue. Connecticut has an annual budget of about $9 billion.
 
The Fear-of-Crime Rate
 Mrs. Kezer said she would reduce the income tax but that it cannot be eliminated without raising other taxes. Senator Larson has pledged a 25 percent income-tax cut for middle-income families, while Mr. Curry has called for the state to finance a billion-dollar cut in local property taxes.
Mr. Rowland's favorite talking point so far has been crime, and his favorite target has been the state's Prison Commissioner, Larry R. Meachum, whom he says coddles inmates with futile policies that try to rehabilitate criminals rather than punish them.
"The prospect of going to prison in and of itself should be a deterrent," Mr. Rowland said in a detailed anti-crime package he released last week. In it, he called for life in prison for career criminals, making all felons serve more time before parole and cutting prison costs by contracting with other states to take Connecticut inmates.
At a news conference in the State Capitol, Mr. Rowland conceded what his charts and graphs omitted, that Connecticut's crime rate has been dropping since its peak in 1990, when crime was hardly mentioned in the gubernatorial campaign.
A recent voter poll by Quinnipiac College, however, found that 84 percent of those surveyed believed that crime was increasing. Nearly as many said the court system and prisons were not treating criminals harshly enough. The survey of 602 registered voters was conducted from Aug. 8 to Aug. 16. It had a sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
"The sense of fear that people have in this state, especially in the cities, especially at night, is at an all-time high," Mr. Rowland said. "And that fear, regardless of what the stats show in the last year or two or whatever period of time we want to use, that fear has really hurt the quality of life."

Rowland is the best-known candidate in this year's gubernatorial field and his message -- more jobs, less crime, better schools, fairer welfare -- is familiar, too.

Buying by Fed Raises Treasury Issues' Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose moderately yesterday, as the Federal Reserve went into the open market to buy securities of various maturities, easing a seasonal shortage of money in the banking system.
The central bank said it was buying Treasury issues with maturities beginning with February 1995. Securities dealers are usually happy when the Fed comes to market to buy, traders say, because it gives them an opportunity to lighten their inventory of securities. And because some market participants had expected the Fed's action, it was not surprising to see prices pushed higher. 
 While the Fed was not expected to disclose the amount of securities it bought until Sept. 8, traders said it could have been about $6 billion.
 
 
Lower Consumer Confidence
 Treasury prices were helped after the Conference Board said consumer confidence dropped in August, while investors largely ignored the Commerce Department's new homes sales report for July, which showed a surge of buying.
The Johnson Redbook release showed retail sales activity of department and chain stores dropped 1.1 percent in the fourth week of August, compared with the equivalent period in July. A week ago, sales were down 1.5 percent. But seasonally adjusted sales were up 8.7 percent compared with the period a year earlier.
Charles Roden, managing director and head of fixed-income investing for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, characterized the bond market as being divided between traders focusing on daily events and investors looking at longer-term projections. He said long-term investors did not want to wait for the lagging effect on the economy of the Fed's last five interest rate increases before making strategic investment changes.
"I believe we are in the top area of the trading range," Mr. Roden said. "This economy cannot withstand higher sustained rates much longer. It is now running in a narrow line between what could be good for business and what could turn bad for business." He said he saw rates turning lower.
"Six months ago, many in the market were forecasting 8 percent on the long end, yet here we are at 7.50 percent, and that has surprised a lot of people," he said. "People with cash building in accounts want to put this money to work, and are afraid if they wait too long they will miss the boat, where they once feared they would get burned."
 
 
Long Bond Yielding 7.46%
 The 30-year bond rose 13/32 , to a price of 10016/32 , up 7/32 , for a yield of 7.46 percent, down from 7.49 percent on Monday. Rates of bills with shorter maturities traded lower, with a three-month issue down 2 basis points, to 4.57 percent, and the six-month down 3 basis points, to 4.88 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Analysts said the reason the surge in new-home sales in July failed to depress prices much yesterday was that traders were focused on the more forward-looking so-called sentiment data.
 The consumer confidence index eased to 89 in August from 91.3 in July, a number that had been revised lower. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the confidence measure to rise to 92.5.
The market has much more data to analyze this week, but the employment numbers, to be released by the Labor Department on Friday, loom large. MMS International, a market and research analysis firm, expects only a small decline in the unemployment rate by December, to 6 percent from 6.1 percent now, despite projected growth of 3 percent in the gross domestic product.
New-home sales surged to 8.3 percent, to an annual selling rate of 664,000 in July from a revision of 613,000 in June. Economists' forecasts had been for 633,000 in July.
The Commerce Department reported that the rebound in new-home sales for July put the rate 2.6 percent above levels a year earlier, coinciding with data on sales of existing homes. On the whole, the report is consistent with some economists' notion that the housing market has cooled because of higher mortgage rates, but remains reasonably healthy.
But the market failed to draw any meaningful direction from the data, reinforcing its trading range pending the release of the jobs data. Economists expect the employment report to show the economy added 232,000 jobs in August, after adding 259,000 in July, with the unemployment rate remaining steady at 6.1 percent.

Dollar Slips Against Mark, As French Banks Lift Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against the German mark and some other currencies yesterday, as an increase in French interest rates fueled speculation that European rates had bottomed after falling for almost two years.
Higher rates could hurt the dollar by making European deposits more attractive. 
 Several leading French commercial banks raised their base lending rates to 7.95 percent from 7.70 percent, effective tomorrow. The move caused currency traders to worry that Germany's central bankers would not lower interest rates after their biweekly meeting tomorrow.
"This is another sign that the long period of European rate cuts is coming to an end," said Richard Vullo, director of foreign-exchange trading at the Bank of Montreal. "The increases definitely knocked the dollar down."
 
Swedish and Italian Rates Up
 Earlier this month, the Swedish and Italian central banks raised interest rates, mostly to shore up their beleaguered currencies.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5760 German marks, down from the day's high of 1.5847 marks, and lower than 1.5780 marks on Monday.
The dollar also fell to 99.57 Japanese yen from 100.02 yen.
But the prospect of stable or higher interest rates in Europe did not set off a significant decline in the dollar, in part because rate increases do not always drive a country's currency up. Often a rate increase spurs investors to sell government bonds, diminishing demand for the currency.
As such, the French franc fell against both the dollar and the German mark, and French bonds tumbled after the French banks raised rates. The franc was quoted in New York at 5.4020 francs to the dollar, down from 5.4010 francs on Monday.
 
Stability Foreseen
 Traders said the dollar is expected to be relatively stable until Friday, when the Government releases its report on employment for August.
A modest rise in employment may be better for the dollar than a large increase because it would ease fears of inflation among bond investors, said Earl Johnson, a foreign-exchange adviser at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
"Most of the numbers are showing that the economy is slowing a little," he said. "That's good for the bonds and the dollar."
The report is expected to show that the economy added 232,000 jobs in August, after a gain of 259,000 in July.
The dollar did edge upward against the British pound and the Canadian dollar. The pound slipped to $1.5339 in New York from $1.5365. And the Canadian dollar fell to 73.07 United States cents from 73.16 cents.

HEADLINE: Gold Mine of Psychiatric Data Discovered in Danish Registry

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN 

DATELINE: RIISKOV, Denmark

 BODY:
DENMARK, known for its superbly crafted furniture, stereo systems and silverware, also offers state-of-the-art psychiatric epidemiology.
Denmark's unparalleled combination of a universal social welfare system and obsessive record keeping has made the country a world laboratory for teasing out subtle patterns in psychiatric data, particularly for severe disorders like schizophrenia, that can be detected only in studies of thousands of people. 
 One of the more alarming recent findings is that suicide rates among patients with schizophrenia have doubled as psychiatric hospitals in Denmark have cut back the number of days they are allowed to stay for treatment. The finding had eluded other researchers, because detecting it required studying both death records and psychiatric records for a vast number of patients. Similar research would be far more difficult in countries like the United States, where hospital stays for schizophrenia have also been cut back.
"We Danes are very good bookkeepers, so we have something you don't find anywhere else in the world: we can follow large numbers of people for a very long time with great precision," observed Dr. Preben Bo Mortensen, a psychiatrist. As senior researcher in the Department of Psychiatric Demography at Denmark's Institute of Basic Psychiatric Research, Dr. Mortensen is at the center of a web of more than 50 international research projects, all drawing on Danish records.
 
Establishment of Registry
 Scientists from around the world travel to join Dr. Mortensen and his colleagues at the psychiatric hospital that houses their institute, tucked by the seashore in Riiskov, a quiet suburb of Aarhus, Denmark's second largest city.
The Danish research is possible because since 1966 a registration number has been used by every man, woman and child in Denmark for a vast range of activities, from entering a psychiatric hospital to getting a job to banking transactions. In addition, virtually all medical care in Denmark is provided by the Government; there are no private hospitals.
"The Danes have a tremendously valuable system of registries," said Dr. David Shore, chief of the Schizophrenia Research Branch at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md. "There's nothing comparable in this country."
Dr. William Eaton, a psychiatric epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, who is collaborating on research with Danish scientists, said, "Denmark is the world's best place to work on the epidemiology of severe psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia."
Research that would be inordinately tedious or simply impossible elsewhere is remarkably easy there. One 30-year study, for example, followed more than 6,000 patients treated for schizophrenia, losing track of just 10 people over three decades.
 
Quality of Data
 This level of precision is unparalleled. As a rule of thumb, Dr. Eaton said, in the United States finding 75 percent of a large group after about a decade would be considered a good result. "You worry about the quality of the data if you can't find 30 percent of the people," he said.
Access to Government records for the entire population allows Danish researchers to track, for instance, how often a person has needed psychiatric help and for what problems, or to compare people's psychiatric histories with a national cancer registry or death certificates. By looking at huge numbers of people, the Danish researchers can detect subtle trends that would be missed by other methods or confirm hypotheses suggested by research with smaller groups.
In the study of schizophrenia and suicide, Dr. Mortensen was able to draw on computerized records to track all 9,156 patients admitted to Danish hospitals for a first episode of schizophrenia from 1970 to 1988, and then to comb through a national registry of causes of death, looking for patients from the study.
"You couldn't do this kind of research anywhere else," said Dr. Mortensen. "Because suicide is a rare event, it requires following a huge number of people for many years to detect a relationship. In a country like the U.S., perhaps 80 percent or more of patients would be untrack able after so many years."
In Denmark, as in the United States, economics and changes in treatment philosophy have led to a reduction of the average length of time people having psychotic episodes are kept in psychiatric hospitals. The average stay was about 50 days in the 1970's, and dropped to 30 days by the mid-1980's as part of a shift toward treating patients in the community.
In findings he reported last year in The British Journal of Psychiatry, Dr. Mortensen discovered that during the first year after patients were released from the hospital in the late 1980's, the rate of suicide among them was 56 percent higher than for patients treated in the early 1970's, when hospital stays were longer.
Further analysis of the records by Dr. Mortensen, not yet published in a scientific journal, shows that over the course of four years after their first admission, the suicide rate among first-time schizophrenic patients rose to double that found when hospital stays were longer. Of the more than 9,000 patients in the study, close to 500 committed suicide within four years of release.
People with schizophrenia have an especially high risk of suicide to begin with, 15 times or more the risk for the general population, with young men having the greatest risk. About 10 percent of people in whom schizophrenia is diagnosed eventually commit suicide, Dr. Shore said.
The findings may suggest, Dr. Mortensen said, that the new policies are forcing patients out of the hospital before they have stabilized enough to flourish on their own. On the other hand, Dr. Shore cautioned that there may be other explanations.
"To show a correlation between length of hospital stay and suicide does not mean that one causes the other," Dr. Shore said. "It simply means that we should look further to find the cause. It might be, for example, that the rise in suicides was due to delays in admitting these people to the hospital in the first place, which undermined their hope."
The death records also revealed that patients treated for schizophrenia have a lower-than-average risk of dying from cancer, Dr. Mortensen discovered.
Men in the study who had been treated for schizophrenia had a rate of death from cancer a third lower than for other men, Dr. Mortensen found; for prostate cancer the rate was about half that of the general population, according to a report published by Dr. Mortensen earlier this year in Schizophrenia Research.
For women treated for schizophrenia, the rate of death from cervical cancer was half that of women in general.
 
Possible Cancer Fighter
 It is not schizophrenia that accounts for the lower rates of cancer, Dr. Mortensen said, but it may have something to do with the treatments for it. Research with animals has found that chlorpromazine, a medication frequently used to treat schizophrenia, slows the growth of experimentally induced cancer tumors.
Following up this hypothesis, Dr. Mortensen found in comparing those patients with schizophrenia who developed cancer of the cervix, prostate, lung, bladder or breast with those who did not, that those treated with chlorpromazine had a lower risk of getting cancer.
The Danish registries have been a steady basis for research on the genetics of mental illness. In the 1960's, in one of the first such studies, Dr. Seymour Kety, a psychiatrist at the National Institute of Mental Health, tracked down the psychiatric histories of parents of 18 men and women with schizophrenia who had been adopted in infancy by parents with no mental illness.
Dr. Kety was able to show that a genetic legacy was far more powerful in predicting that a child would grow up to have schizophrenia than the psychological dynamics of the family in which the child grew up. Dr. Kety recently verified his earlier results with data published in the June issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry.
 
False Notion Dispelled
 Dr. Kety's findings played a crucial role in vanquishing what had been the prevailing psychiatric wisdom, that schizophrenia was a result of destructive communications between parents and their children -- an outlook that in effect laid the blame on parents for what today is seen as a disease with biological and genetic causes.
To follow up studies suggesting that complications at birth heighten the risk of schizophrenia later in life, Dr. Mortensen and Dr. Eaton are designing an ambitious study that will involve tens of thousands of people. Drawing on records that describe any complications during childbirth, they will search the country's psychiatric records to establish the degree to which such problems are associated with a higher risk of developing mental illness later in life.
"In the past, studies on this question have involved around 200 or 300 people," Dr. Mortensen said. "Ours will examine between 40,000 to 60,000 people, giving us an immensely greater power of precision. It's like having a stronger microscope."

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
THERE has been much talk in recent years about something called "the wine lake." Of course, there is no such thing; not literally, anyway. There have been wine-filled swimming pools, even a few water towers. Or so they say. But no lake. 
 It's nothing more than a colorful way of describing the immense surplus of wine that the industry has been saddled with for the better part of a decade. Overproduction is endemic to the wine business. Millions of gallons of wine are distilled into commercial alcohol every year. Most of it is the cheap stuff.
Overproduction of fine wine is less common. Several factors can bring it on; an excellent growing season and a balky public are two of the most common. When those two factors are combined, as they have been in recent years, it can be disastrous, or nearly so, for the trade.
The problem is particularly acute in Bordeaux, where modern grape-growing and wine-making methods produced some exceptionally large vintages in the 1970's and 1980's. But even if the crops had not been so large, the sheer number of good vintages would have filled the cellars and, perhaps, even a swimming pool or two.
In the first half of the century, about half a dozen vintages were worth mentioning and only three were considered memorable: 1929, 1945 and 1949. Between 1950 and 1970, there were five: 1953, 1955, 1959, 1961 and 1966. In the 1970's, Bordeaux entered on a new epoch, with four good vintages: 1970, 1975, 1978 and 1979.
In fact, from 1970 on, good vintages became the norm. Even the poor years were better than the poor years of the past. Unexceptional years like 1972, 1974 and 1977 were considerably better than 1963 and 1965, which were the truly awful vintages of the 1960's.
The 1980 vintage was light but palatable. Only two other years in that decade, 1984 and 1987, were rated below par, and even so, both years produced some pleasant, drinkable wines. Every other year of the decade produced excellent wines, with 1982 particularly outstanding.
The 1980's were a time of excess; even staid Bordeaux wine professionals were predicting that science had conquered nature in the winery and the vineyard. There would be no more bad years, they said.
If anything, the 1990's began on the same high note. Critics rated the 1990 vintage above the famous 1982. Some compared it, inaccurately, to the now legendary 1961. The 1961 was quintessentially French: elegant, intense and some of the best, even now, not ready to drink. The 1990 was rich, fruity, opulent and, except for a few dreadnoughts, almost accessible now.
Meanwhile, major markets, particularly the United States, had been drying up. Lagging economies, new concerns about health and the new world competition for a share of the market all served to dampen Bordeaux's euphoria. The wines were better and better, but more and more difficult to sell.
Then, once more, nature intervened. Both the 1991 and 1992 vintages received relatively poor ratings. In 1991, many famous chateaus sold off their wine in bulk rather than put their names on it.
Almost overnight, it seemed, customers began to look to the older, highly rated but unsold vintages for bargains. Even the much-maligned wines of 1984 and 1987 were said to "have finally come around," and were being offered by newly optimistic wine merchants. Here in New York and elsewhere around the country, the first half of 1994 is turning out to be the best first half in five years or more. And as the merchants gleefully remind themselves, the second half of the year, or more specifically the last quarter, is the most lucrative time of year in the wine and spirits business.
Bordeaux lovers take note: This may be the time to replenish your cellars -- even if your cellars are actually hall closets or six-bottle racks under the kitchen sink.
Following is a selection of Bordeaux wines from four vintages that have come back into the public eye because more recent years have been disappointing. The prices are those listed by several retailers in New York City and the metropolitan area. Discounters may charge less; retailers in less competitive situations may charge more.
From 1985: Chateau Simard, from St. Emilion, $15; Chateau de Sales, Pomerol, $20; Chateau Beau Site, St. Estephe, $19; Carruades de Lafite, Pauillac, the second wine of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, $22; Clos des Jacobins, St. Emilion, $20.
From 1986: Chateau Cantemerle, Haut-Medoc, $15; Chateau Meyney, St. Estephe, $19; Chateau St. Pierre, St. Julien, $20; Chateau Bourgneuf, Pomerol, $19; Chateau Leoville-Poyferre, $22; Chateau Latour Haut-Brion, Graves, $22; Chateau Lynch-Bages, Pauillac, $27.
From 1988: Chateau de Sales, Pomerol, $15; Smith-Haut-Lafite, Graves, $14; Chateau Lynch-Bages, Pauillac, $29; Chateau Haut-Batailley, Pauillac, $16; Chateau Leoville-Poyferre, St. Julien, $21.
From 1989: Clos l'Eglise, Pomerol, $20; Chateau Bellevue, St. Emilion, $19; Canon-Moueix, Fronsac, $15; Chateau Gloria, St. Julien, $17; Chateau Haut-Bages-Averous, Pauillac, the second wine of Chateau Lynch-Bages, $18; Chateau Phelan-Segur, St. Estephe, $17, and Chateau Prieure-Lichine, Margaux, $20.
Notice that all but two of those wines are under $25; most are under $20, and many are less expensive than they were when they first came on the market in more free-spending times. The Lynch-Bages 1986 at $27 and the 1988 at $29 are true bargains. Jean-Michel Cazes makes wine to rival the first growths at this fifth-growth chateau, and this is a chance to buy it at reasonable prices.
All these wines can be laid down for another five years or so, but a few can also be drunk now, notably the Pomerols, like de Sales, Bourgneuf and Clos l'Eglise.

TASTINGS
Heitz Cellar Grignolino, Napa Valley, non-vintage; about $6.50.
 
Joe Heitz found grignolino growing on his land near St. Helena, Calif., when he bought the place some 30 years ago. Since then, he has become known for his magnificent cabernets, but he has never abandoned his lowly grignolino vines. From them he makes two simple Italian-style wines that perfectly match simple Italian meals. One wine is red, the other rose. Grignolino is pronounced grin-yo-LEE-no in Italy and green-oh-LEE-no in California. Take your choice. In Italy, its native land, grignolino is found mostly in the northwest, in the province of Asti. There it produces light, pleasant wines that are rarely if ever exported. In fact, the dynamic Angelo Gaja, the Italian wine maker, imports Mr. Heitz's grignolino from California, saying none in Italy can match it. In California, Italian grape varieties are all the rage, but hardly any of the wines have lived up to the fanfare they've received. This grignolino, unheralded and unpretentious, is a much better value for the little money it costs.

HEADLINE: The Fracturing of the Middle Class

BYLINE: By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich is Secretary of Labor. This article is adapted from a speech to be delivered today at the Center for National Policy in Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Since last Labor Day, the economy has generated more than 2.5 million jobs for Americans. But despite this progress, long-term trends are splitting the old middle class into three new groups: an underclass largely trapped in center cities, increasingly isolated from the core economy; an overclass, those in a position to ride the waves of change; and in between, the largest group, an anxious class, most of whom hold jobs but are justifiably uneasy about their own standing and fearful for their children's futures.
The fundamental fault line through the labor force divides workers by education and skills. As recently as 1979, a male college graduate earned 49 percent more than a man with only a high school diploma -- a sizable difference, to be sure, but not too much for the two to share the label "middle class." By 1992, the gap had widened to 83 percent, and the notion of common prospects had faded considerably. 
 There is a similar divergence in benefits. Employer-sponsored health coverage has declined only slightly for workers with college degrees, covering 79 percent in 1979 and 76 percent in 1993. But the rate for high school graduates has fallen from 68 percent to 60 percent, and among high school dropouts, from 53 percent to 36 percent. Nearly two-thirds of workers with college degrees have employer-sponsored pension plans, but fewer than a quarter of high school dropouts do.
Similarly with the risk of joblessness: unemployment among high school dropouts rose from an average of 7 percent during the 1970's to 12 percent in the 1980's, and it was over 12 percent last year. But over the same two decades, unemployment for workers with college degrees held fairly steady at around 3 percent. This helps explain why Wall Street can fret that unemployment is too low to contain inflation while eight million willing workers are jobless. Markets for skilled labor are becoming tight in parts of the economy. Yet many less skilled workers are walled off from the leading edges of the economy.
What lies behind these widening disparities? Manufacturing jobs were once the gateway to the middle class. While it is a myth that international trade has robbed America of its manufacturing industries, technological changes have diminished the role of labor, especially unskilled labor, in the modern factory. Global trade and investment have surely hastened these changes.
Labor unions have long helped shore up wages and benefits for workers without high-level skills. But today, only 11 percent of the private-sector work force is unionized. Let there be no doubt: a revitalization of the labor movement would help reverse the erosion of the middle class.
But the forces unleashed by technology must be mastered, not merely buffered. As increasingly capable machines join Americans at the workplace -- join them as both co-workers and competitors -- the payoff to education and training has soared, and the penalty for lacking skills has stiffened. The most striking change has been the brash arrival of the computer. Yet while the information highway promises to speed some people to desirable destinations, it may leave others stranded in the technological version of inner-city ghettos. Two-thirds of college graduates use computers at work, but fewer than one in 10 high school dropouts.
Yet the long-term data also affirm the potential for building a new middle class. Some of the fastest job growth in America is occurring among technicians, who defy the categories of the old economy. In my travels I've met vending-machine repair workers who use hand-held computers to identify problems and communicate with the home office, and managers in retail stores who tap personal computers to monitor sales and inventories. Some workers drive trucks equipped with computers and modems and make just-in-time deliveries. Others orchestrate sophisticated spreadsheet and graphics programs to create value in ways unimaginable a decade ago.
The technician jobs that will sustain the core of the new middle class usually require some education beyond high school, but they do not always demand a four-year college degree. Degrees from community colleges, the unsung heroes of the new middle class, are paying off, and their enrollments are rising.
This Administration's work-force agenda is inspired by the evidence that skills matter and that they can be learned. The fruits of our commitment to creating a new middle class are already emerging. Ironically, many of these accomplishments have been little noticed because of the bipartisan consensus supporting them. Bipartisanship summons less attention than ideological brawls.
Consider: 130,000 more children each year can now be made ready to learn through Head Start. School systems have millions of dollars in new incentives to improve their performance. Over the next six years, almost half a million young Americans will start youth apprenticeships.
Starting this fall, 20,000 young people will enter National Service, earning money that they can apply to a college education. The 3.5 million people who take out education loans each year may now repay their loans as a percentage of future income. We are making work pay by delivering tax relief to 15 million working families with modest incomes. And the unemployment insurance system is being transformed into a re-employment system; this year, 150,000 more Americans who lost jobs will get the help they need to find new ones.
American business has its own role to play. Skills learned on the job or in a work-related setting are especially valuable. But with some exceptions, companies do too little training and concentrate on workers who are already skilled. We need a new social compact with American business. In its first year and a half, the Clinton Administration has delivered much of what business has sought to bolster its competitiveness -- lower deficits, low inflation, more open world markets, promotion of American business abroad. Now business needs to do its part, by investing in the skills of all workers.
Unlike the citizens of most other nations, Americans have always been united less by a shared past than by shared dreams of a better future. If we lose that common future, we lose the glue that holds our nation together. As we approach Labor Day 1994 -- the 100th anniversary of America's workers' holiday -- let us commit to building the foundations of a new middle class.

HEADLINE: In America;
A Season Of Service

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Think of it as an antidote to cynicism, a rejection of the rampant selfishness that managed somehow to become fashionable in the 1980's. Think of it as a return to the can-do spirit of the 50's and 60's, when large numbers of Americans believed it was possible to find remedies for violence and injustice, for poverty and ignorance, for the buffoonery and corruption of politicians, and for the wholesale degradation of the environment.
"I challenge a new generation of young Americans to a season of service," said Bill Clinton in his inaugural address. "There is so much to be done -- enough, indeed, for millions of others who are still young in spirit to give of themselves in service, too." 
 On Sept. 12, amid elaborate ceremonies planned for the South Lawn of the White House, the President's national service program will get fully under way. It's called AmeriCorps and it's described as a domestic version of the Peace Corps. Its scope is less than I would have wished, but more than we've come to expect from a sociopolitical environment that over the past decade and a half has been poisoned by greed, a collapse of ideals and contempt for the old-fashioned notion of brotherhood.
In that environment, we were free to choose between the national values espoused by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and those currently embraced by Representative Newt Gingrich. We opted for Mr. Gingrich's.
The President's national service program is a modest step in Dr. King's direction.
Under the program, several thousand young Americans from all kinds of backgrounds will offer their services to organizations working on problems related to education, public safety, social services and the environment. For a two-year commitment, the participants will be paid $7,500 a year and will receive a credit of $9,450 ($4,725 a year) that can be used for college or graduate school expenses.
The program will reach into urban, suburban and rural America. Parts of it have already started. Young men and women are helping to restore wildlife habitats, conducting childhood immunization programs, escorting children and the elderly through dangerous inner-city neighborhoods, counseling drug abusers, providing preventive health services and improving neglected playgrounds, parks and wetlands.
Tiffany Tidwell, an honors graduate from the University of Kansas, is teaching French at a public school in the Mississippi Delta. Leo Negron, who grew up in a tough neighborhood in Chicago, is teaching construction skills to teen-agers. Laura Sullivan, who grew up in a wealthy suburb in Massachusetts, has joined a program in Baltimore that provides assistance to poor women who want to start their own businesses.
"We have a lot of domestic problems that need creative answers," Ms. Sullivan said. "And I wanted to get to know the neighborhoods in the inner cities, rather than just living in the ivory tower of a college community."
She referred to friends who are serving in the military and said: "They are defending us internationally. I feel strongly that there should be a force of young people that are kind of defending us domestically."
Besides providing assistance to many worthwhile organizations, AmeriCorps is a way for young people to see a variety of fellow Americans up close and personal, the way they really are, without the distorting filter of the boob tube. It's a way to get beyond the stereotypes of situation comedy and the local news.
"Whenever possible," said Eli Segal, chief chaperone for this noble effort, "we want youngsters from different geographic areas, from different races and ethnic groups and from different economic backgrounds to pitch in and work together."
Mr. Segal, an assistant to the President, is the chief executive of the Corporation for National Service. He expects to have 20,000 AmeriCorps enlistees spread out across the country by the end of the year. "And if it works," he said, "we could have 100,000 by the end of 1996."
I have always believed that national service should be compulsory. Every American should serve two years in some military or civilian capacity. There should be more to patriotism than singing "The Star-Spangled Banner" at a ball game, or rooting (from the comfort of our living rooms) for the American team to win a nationally televised war.
AmeriCorps is a start.

HEADLINE: Junk Loans, Not Bonds, Are Hot on Wall Street

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
As the underwriting of junk bonds has begun to cool this year, some Wall Street firms are aggressively moving into a business that until now has been the preserve of commercial banks. Call it junk loans.
In recent months, Merrill Lynch & Company, Lehman Brothers Inc., CS First Boston and Goldman, Sachs & Company have raided the ranks of the commercial banks, hiring away executives experienced in the art of putting together corporate loan packages and assembling groups of banks to put up the cash. 
 This month, Lehman Brothers arranged a $50 million loan for Acme Metals Inc., a steel producer in Riverdale, Ill. Merrill Lynch is about to complete its first loan deal, a $126 million credit for the Best Buy Company, an electronics retailer based in Minneapolis.
In lining up such loans, Wall Street has no intention of putting its own capital at risk, a business it flirted with briefly -- with disastrous results -- during the 1980's takeover boom, only to find itself losing millions of dollars on temporary or so-called bridge loans that went sour.
This time, the aim of investment bankers is simply to service corporate borrowers that generally have more difficulty raising cash to expand, make acquisitions or recapitalize, while helping themselves to some of the lush fees that commercial banks have long enjoyed for arranging and syndicating such loans.
It's also tit for tat. Ever since Congress began dismantling the Depression-era regulations that separate Wall Street and the commercial banks, the banks have been eagerly treading on Wall Street's domain by issuing everything from junk bonds to blue-chip stocks. Now Wall Street is striking back, saying that it, too, can offer a full spectrum of services, including loans.
"One-stop shopping is going to be a very significant part of the way we do business," said Bob O'Brien, who recently joined CS First Boston from Chemical Bank to head its loan effort.
But some skeptics wonder if Wall Street really has a future in lending. The strength of the street, according to Christopher L. Snyder, president of the Loan Pricing Corporation, a financial data base that compiles information about the secondary market for bank loans, is structuring deals and distributing securities, not providing the kind of personal service that bankers offer borrowers.
After all, he added, just because Wall Street trades billions of dollars in mortgage-backed bonds does not mean that its investment bankers should write home mortgages.
The investment bankers counter that lining up loans to companies without investment ratings is just an extension of their current business. In the past, Wall Street has raised money for such customers by issuing bonds with high yields -- so-called junk bonds -- to compensate for the added risk.
That business hit record levels last year. But since interest rates began rising in February, the appetite for bonds has diminished while interest in so-called leveraged or junk loans has grown. In the first eight months of this year, the money raised by junk bonds declined 21 percent, compared with the corresponding period of 1993, while the amount of junk loans written in the first half of this year more than doubled, to almost $27 billion, from $12 billion in the first half of 1993.
 
Added Risks, but Variable Rates
 Leveraged loans, like junk bonds, are risky because they are generally made to companies with below-investment-grade credit ratings, meaning that there is a greater chance of default. They are also made at yields above regular market rates.
But unlike bonds, which mostly have fixed rates, the loans have a variable rate that will rise with market interest rates. The loans also give the lender the first claim on the company's assets if it goes bust. So while bond buyers are often spooked by rising rates, banks and other institutions are often more willing to step into the breach with adjustable-rate junk loans.
Acme Metals was looking to raise $370 million to expand its Acme Steel subsidiary when it approached Lehman Brothers for advice. The early structure of the proposed package was a combination of an issue of new common stock and junk bonds, according to Jim Hoekwater, the company's treasurer. Then the Lehman advisers, led by Bart McDade, managing director of the high-yield business, suggested raising $50 million from a leveraged loan.
In its final form, the Acme deal consisted of $205 million in junk bonds in two issues with interest rates of 12.5 percent and 13.5 percent, $118 million in new common stock, an $80 million revolving loan and the $50 million leveraged loan, with an interest rate that floats four percentage points over the three-month London interbank offered rate, which was 5 percent yesterday.
At a current interest rate of around 9 percent, Acme's loan costs the company considerably less than its junk bonds. Mr. Hoekwater was pleased. "They bought us a total package that met our needs, saved us money and gave us greater flexibility," he said.
Junk loans are not really new. During the corporate takeover and leveraged-buyout boom of the late 1980's, loans from commercial banks financed many of the deals. The market peaked in 1989, when more than $186 billion in leveraged loans were written, compared with only $25 billion in junk bonds.
Several Wall Street firms also got into the lending business at that time, making so-called bridge loans to finance corporate takeovers that in some cases turned out to be reckless gambles. In the most celebrated case, First Boston had to be bailed out by its parent, Credit Suisse, to the tune of $650 million after it got stuck holding several of its bridge loans.
That track record may hurt Wall Street in its new effort. "The question is: Will other commercial banks have enough confidence in the credit process that a Wall Street firm uses to feel comfortable enough to buy their paper?" said Mark G. Solow, the senior executive vice president responsible for corporate banking at the Chemical Banking Corporation, the leading arranger of corporate loans.
In the case of CS First Boston, the question is moot because Credit Suisse, the commercial banking unit of First Boston's parent, CS Holdings Inc., will be performing the credit assessments and holding some of the loans made by First Boston.
For their part, the other investment bankers say they are up to the task. "In terms of risk, we feel that we have as good credit skills as anyone in the market," said Seth Waugh, managing director of Merrill Lynch's high-yield bond business.
And in many cases, the people who will be dealing the loans to banks from Wall Street are the same people who have been doing the work at the commercial banks. Merrill Lynch, CS First Boston and Lehman Brothers have raided Chemical's large corporate loan department, while in the most recent example, Goldman, Sachs hired Edward Forst, the managing director in charge of loan sales and trading at Bankers Trust Securities, a unit of the Bankers Trust Company.
"Why would clients believe them when they were at Chemical but not when they are at Merrill Lynch?" asked a fund manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
But what makes the market more attractive and less risky for Wall Street now than it was in the 1980's is that the loan business is beginning to look more like the securities business. While commercial banks have traditionally lent money and waited for it to be paid back, a rising number of banks have been trading their loans to other banks, insurance companies, private money managers and mutual funds.
 
Window of Opportunity
 That, ironically, has created the window of opportunity for Wall Street to challenge the banks. Instead of taking a large risk and tying up their capital by holding loans on their books as they did with the bridge loans in the 1980's, the investment banks believe that they will be able to arrange the loans, earning the "skim," or fee, and then sell them to investors, much in the way that they distribute a bond issue.
"It is a natural extension of where our business is going," Mr. Waugh said. "The market has become more liquid. It's a lot more like the underwriting market."
Depending on the type of loan, the investment banks can sell them to other banks, or to a growing number of fund managers and other investors buying loans on the secondary market.
"Through the eyes of a nonbank investor these loans are just senior bonds with short maturities that also have collateral pledged to them," said Jeffrey S. Garner, portfolio manager of Eaton Vance Prime Rate Reserves, a $650 million mutual fund that invests only in corporate loans.
Mr. Garner said the trade in loans might one day grow into a market with volume of hundreds of billions of dollars. "The commercial paper market has grown from $10 billion in 1965 to more than $500 billion today," he said, referring to the short-term paper that top corporations regularly issue to raise cash. "Now the bank loan market for noninvestment- grade companies is beginning to undergo a similar transformation."
But to date, volume on the secondary market is still small. More than $28 billion in new leveraged loans were written last year, yet the volume on loan trading desks at the commercial banks and on Wall Street totaled just $15 billion. That means that some investment banks may be left holding loans on their books longer than they like.
Two weeks after the loan to Acme Metals was closed, Lehman had still not sold it all to investors in the secondary market, according to Mr. Hoekwater, the company treasurer.
"It's a young market," he said. "I think they are making good progress."
A Lehman spokesman said the firm was not concerned by the amount still sitting on its books. "We are exactly where we want to be," he said, referring to the Acme loan.
One restraint on the growth of the leveraged loan trade is that many institutions are barred from investing in instruments that are not investment grade. Another is that loans are not standardized like stocks and bonds. To assess a loan's value, an investor must assess the collateral as well as any covenants that might restrict the borrower's ability to take on more debt or limit the way the credit can be used.
A recent development may help remedy this problem: the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the bond-rating service, has begun rating corporate loans. The new system gauges the risk an investor would take by buying a given loan. The top rating means the expected loss of principal if the borrower defaulted would be less than 1 percent; the lowest rating estimates a loss of more than 20 percent.
"The key to liquidity is standardization," said Mr. Snyder of the Loan Pricing Corporation, "Can you make a trade on the phone, or do you need documents?"

DATELINE: SANTA BARBARA, Calif.

 BODY:
The 9-year-old Cuban boy with the cataract in his eye showed me the condoms he had used as balloons at his birthday party. He pulled out the single stick of gum he'd been chewing for a week. He brought over the two tattered photo albums he'd stuffed with pieces of Carnation labels, stickers that said "Knorr's Soup" and ads for Nescafe -- status symbols in the Havana fourth grade. His mother, a policewoman and a staunch Fidelista who refused to accept gifts from a visitor, proudly pointed out photos of her cousins' suburban home and Nissan in Miami.
Everyone in Cuba knows that the country is bankrupt; everyone knows that almost anything must be better than the steady supply of nothing that the Government offers. Everyone can see that the whole island is shuddering to a halt, like the 40-year-old Plymouths that line the streets of a city where gasoline is illegal. Prostitution, which was scarcely visible (if only for security reasons) five years ago, is pandemic now: the tourist hotels are filled with Cuban teen-agers reddening their lips with children's crayons. 
 The Government billboards used to proclaim, "We Are Happy Here." Now they say only, "We Are Here." The official currency is more or less the dollar. And while more and more people turn to santeria, the Cuban equivalent of voodoo, as a source of miracles, the offerings of food they leave out in the streets for the gods are all too often filched by hungry neighbors.
It would not take an ironist to see that after 35 years of revolution, Fidel Castro has succeeded in turning his land into precisely the kind of Babylon he once came to scourge: a nest of brothels and drugs, dependent on foreign income, where the greatest symbols of power are visiting capitalists.
Yet Cubans have been living off next to nothing for decades. On my annual visit to the island in February, I was struck by the fact that the typical income was down to $1.30 a month, and yet this still seemed enough to put food on the table. Friends kept talking about the Golden Age -- before the collapse of the East Bloc in 1989; I didn't remind them that they had been delivering much the same elegies in 1987.
Sometimes it seems as if the country's psychological reserves may be emptying: "Before, we could blame everything on the Soviets," one friend told me. "But now the Soviets are gone, and things are worse than ever." But just as often, people noted that at least there was nobody starving on the streets.
It is easy to forget, amid the dramatic images of people risking their lives to flee in makeshift boats, that Cubans have had a crash course in suffering and sacrifice for decades now. They have developed reserves of resourcefulness and patience that would put the rest of us to shame.
Nearly all of them are seasoned experts at making do and finding ways around the system: trading a little tomato sauce for the promise of some rum, fixing a TV in exchange for a kiss. A tourist hustler I know once invited me to his flat for a dinner of lobster and Champagne. (Now he's serving a year's sentence in a labor camp for trading dollars. It wasn't so bad, he told me with a smile when I visited -- food was guaranteed there, and he was allowed to go home every six weeks.)
All of us know -- and every Cuban knows -- the ironies of a country with well-trained doctors and no medicine, with a highly educated population and no books. Yet what such miseries obscure is that for many Cubans, the alternatives to their all-too-familiar leader are not bright. More than half of all Cubans have known no other president, causing many to prefer the devil they know to the devil they don't.
They look at his lieutenants, and see all of his severity and little of his intelligence; they look across the water to Miami, and see the people who held them down before, they feel, waiting to reclaim their mansions. They note with bitterness that gusanos -- the "traitors" who fled, many of them in the Mariel boat lift -- can now return to the island and be treated as royalty (foreigners with money!).
But they also acknowledge that their leader has made their tiny island, half as populous as Mexico City, a forceful player on the world stage. As in Vietnam, impatience with Marxism is mixed with a genuine, and often fervent, nationalism. There are many who would still prefer a self-ruled Cuba to one that's tarted up.
Most Cubans realize that those who flee the country know almost nothing of what they're going to, beyond what they've seen in foreign magazines. And those who arrive in the land of "Dynasty" dreams with little English and no training in a carrot-and-stick economy often end up in the poorest areas of Miami or New York, hustling drugs or joining gangs. One friend I know who made it here as a political refugee quickly wrote back to his equally restless friends in Havana to stay put: America was not for the weak, he said, and -- believe it or not -- the reports of homelessness and poverty were true!
The most recent letter I got from Cuba, last week, said, "I would like to see the end of this bad dream: no food, no medicine, no transportation, no electricity, no water . . . ." Yet the writer, an actress, concluded, "My country is in crisis, but I am not."
Americans are wise to see the thousands of Cubans taking to the seas as exemplars of a widespread dissatisfaction with a country that asks everything of its people and gives almost nothing in return; but we would be wiser still to recall the many millions more who, through inertia or trepidation or even a kind of qualifiedpatriotism, choose to sit things out.
