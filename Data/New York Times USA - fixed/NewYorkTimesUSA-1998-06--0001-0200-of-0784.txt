HEADLINE: Businesses Explore Cyberauctions

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
When Mark A. Weimer talks about Internet auctions, both delight and frustration play in his voice. For six months, his Del Ray Beach, Fla., company, INXS Inc. -- pronounced "in excess," an apt name for a dealer in surplus and used equipment -- has been selling slow-moving microscopes and accessories, even old gas chromatographs, on an on-line auction run by Labx Technologies Inc. He has cleared about $15,000 for items he had been ready to throw out, and had an absolute ball doing it.
"It was such a kick, watching guys electronically beat each other up, raising their bids by $1 a pop," Mr. Weimer said. 
 So why the frustration? Because he cannot forget the items he did discard. "I figure I could have gotten $2,000 each for machines I threw out," he said. "Now, I throw nothing away without checking Labx first."
Chalk up another convert to the brave new world of business-to-business Internet auctions. They are already growing common for commodities like oil and gas. And now, a whole new industry is forming around the idea that business people are as likely to bid electronically for machine tools and computer parts as consumers are to bid for sneakers and personal computers.
"Auctioneers without Internet auctions will be out of business in five years," said Michael Brader-Araje, chief executive of Open Site Technologies (www.opensite.com), which sells auction software. It sounds self-serving, but the numbers are on his side. Forrester Research Inc., which analyzes the impact of technology, estimates that $8.7 billion worth of business-to-business goods will be auctioned on line this year, growing to $52.6 billion in 2002.
The growth is no surprise. This is a low-cost, low-risk business for all sides. Sellers pay nothing if their products do not move. Buyers can stop payment on checks if the goods are not as advertised. And the auctioneer's costs, limited to software and advertising, plummet once it has a solid base of buyers and sellers.
Then there is the fun factor. "This is a novel way to buy things that adds real entertainment value to some stodgy industries," said Scott Andrews, president of Sciquest Inc., which will soon auction laboratory equipment on the Net.
The list of auctioneers hawking business wares is growing fast. Labx already auctions lab equipment, while Fast Parts Inc. auctions surplus electronic parts.
Next Monday, Norman Levy Associates, a huge industrial equipment auctioneer, will hold its first Internet auction. Next month, H. K. Equipment, which sells used vacuum furnaces and other laboratory items, will start auctioning them on the Net. And before year-end, Internet Liquidators International, a consumer cyberauction company, will test two auction formats: one for diverse wares from a single source -- say, a corporate liquidation; the other for similar wares from different vendors -- say, agricultural equipment or used cars.
"There's so much custom-made equipment that gets sold for scrap, because no one realizes that it fits perfectly for a project being done half a world away," said Paul Godin, president of Internet Liquidators.
Cyberauctions are not problem- free. Although vendors post descriptions and photographs of their goods, bidders are really buying blind. The anonymous nature of most auctions -- bidders show up on the screen as, say, Paddle 7 -- makes it hard for sellers and buyers to gauge negotiating styles or form relationships.
And it presumes that all potential buyers are comfortable surfing the Web. "I don't even have a computer, so how could I bid?" asked Charles N. Yanoff, president of Pattern Metals Company, a steel distributor.
There are other problems in the wings. Anyone with the software and a Web page can run an auction, and auctioneers worry that fly-by-night operators will crowd the field with shoddily run sales. "Let's face it, Internet software is a dime a dozen," said Bob Kafuto, president of Labx.
And the novelty of on-line bidding can attract mischief-makers, who clog the process with bogus bids. Although most auctioneers do a cursory check of each bidder's legitimacy, most acknowledge that a determined prankster can get through.
"There's still the small problem of, are the buyers real, will they pay, will they pick up the equipment on time?" said Stuart I. Feldman, director of the I.B.M. Institute for Advanced Commerce.
Most cyberauctions work like this: Bidders key in their bids, and are told immediately, either on screen or by E-mail, if their bid is topped. There are official closing times, but the electronic gavel rarely comes down until at least two minutes go by without a bid. At that point, the auctioneer puts the winning bidder in touch with the seller, takes a commission from both, and bows out.
But there the similarities end. Some auctions last an hour, some a week. Some auctioneers hold separate auctions for each item; others hold regularly scheduled auctions of assorted items. Still others hold auctions only when they have enough wares to draw a big bidding crowd.
At least one, Freemarkets Online, holds reverse auctions -- companies describe what they want to buy, and vendors bid for the contract. "We provide a level field, where a small company gets the same data as General Motors," said Glen Meakem, chief executive of Freemarkets.
Kent L. Brittan, vice president for supply management at United Technologies, has bought numerous plastic parts, machined items and the like through Freemarkets. "We've saved at least 10 percent on everything, and we've met suppliers that we'd never have known of," he said.
Indeed, since bidders can participate without leaving their desks, and since business cyberauctions often operate round the clock, their potential audience is huge. "When you're holding a live auction at 4 P.M. in Detroit, it's rough for someone in Paris to bid," said Robert Levy, Norman Levy's president.
Aficionados of cyberauctions list other pluses:
*The auctions let companies push older models off their shelves and off their books. "When we need inventory space, auctions are our first choice," said Steven C. Miles, sales manager of Analtech Inc., a maker of laboratory equipment.
*They obviate the need to transport equipment to a live auction. "I'll happily take a lower price for the convenience," said William C. Nagy, president of Technik Machine Tool Inc., which hopes to sell surface grinders at Norman Levy's auction.
*They let equipment dealers buy and sell goods without moving them to their own warehouses. "I can buy equipment in Vermont once our auction is up," said Peggy Skelly, a sales representative at H. K. Equipment, in Wilmington, Mass.
*They let companies unload excess parts anonymously. "No one wants to tell the world they lost a big order," said Kristine McCusker, marketing manager for Fast Parts.
*They help companies that have closed or modernized plants place unneeded tools. "Used-equipment dealers just never give you full value," said Gary Lyons, a plant manager of Chanute Manufacturing Company, which just switched to numerically controlled drills, and will soon auction off its manual ones.
Even Mr. Yanoff, the self-described computer illiterate, is putting a metal-forming machine into the Norman Levy auction. He expects to get $65,000 for it.
"We don't use it anymore, but I hadn't tried to sell it," he said. "It would be hard to get what it's worth by just advertising locally."

HEADLINE: Creating a Silicon Valley in the Washington Area

BYLINE: By TOM WATSON 

 BODY:
In the new-media business, there is a palpable sense of regional competition among the centers for Internet commerce and content. Silicon Valley in Northern California, Silicon Alley in New York and the recently named Digital Coast of greater Los Angeles all lay claim to a share of status as places where start-ups prosper, venture capital flows and the sky's the limit in the digital future.
And then there is Washington, and the surrounding area from Baltimore down through northern Virginia. It has no fancy nickname. It does not yet enjoy a hip reputation among the wired set. 
 But it does have more than a thousand Internet-related start-up companies, a generation of technology business experience and growth, and a ready market for digital services in the Federal Government and all the political entities eager to exploit the reach and promise of the Net.
And it also has Mario Morino. The 54-year-old is the guiding light and financial patron of an ambitious effort to make the Washington area a model for entrepreneurial success in new media.
Mr. Morino has some experience with start-ups. He founded a small software company in northern Virginia, built it relentlessly, and walked away with $80 million when the Legent Corporation was purchased by Computer Associates in 1995.
He used the money to start the Morino Institute, which finances programs in youth advocacy and services, entrepreneurship, social networking and community services.
In 1995, the Institute founded the Potomac Knowledgeway Project, which aims to promote growth in "knowledge-based" business in the region.
Last year, it started a spinoff, the Netpreneur program, which is aimed at building the wired business community by getting digital entrepreneurs together, on line and off. While the Knowledgeway Project is expected to have only a five-year existence, Mr. Morino and his team believe the Netpreneur program can be self-sustaining and lead to a model that can be used throughout the country.
All of these efforts have two things in common: they are financed by Mr. Morino to the tune of what he terms "seven figures" a year. And they are all based on Mr. Marino's belief that a newly networked society combined with opportunity for small-business growth can lead to social change. His heady goals for the region include 2,000 new start-up companies, 50,000 new jobs and $2.5 billion in new income. He also hopes to establish "greater Washington as the top U.S. location for knowledge-based companies and entrepreneurial activity."
Netpreneur (www.netpreneur.org) sponsors conferences, offers a data base of business plans for companies looking for investors, and plans a full-scale survey of the Washington region's new-media economy, similar to those commissioned by the New York New Media Association of Silicon Alley.
Netpreneur's "Coffee and DoughNets" gatherings bring business people together in informal settings, hooking up start-up companies with potential investors, and large companies with small ones.
"I just love the start-ups," Mr. Morino said, adding that the region's big-business past had not encouraged start-ups until recently. "I have tremendous empathy for that kind of person, and I think what I have to offer resonates well with kids in the game right now."
The "kids" seem to agree. Mr. Morino's rapid-fire delivery and no-nonsense business advice for start-ups resonate among the small shops popping up from downtown Washington to Reston, Va.
"He's great at the end of meetings," said Eric Loeb, 35, co-founder of the Washington-based Net Capitol, a new-media services and applications company that serves public affairs organizations. "It's an impromptu business lesson and it's very compelling, like a little sermon."
Mr. Loeb said one particular piece of advice from Mr. Morino -- "your goal is to dominate your niche" -- helped Net Capitol better focus its efforts.
Of course, the Washington region has several things going for it besides a patron with deep pockets. For one, it boasts one of the largest concentrations of Internet service providers in the world, companies like UUNet, Digex, America Online, MCI and PSINet. And it has a ready source of customers for Internet design, services and consulting businesses: the Government and its many tentacles.
"What's unique about Washington is that we have representatives of every special interest group and every country in the world, and they all want to be on the Web," said Chris Casey, 32, the chief technologist for the Senate Democratic leadership's Technology and Communications Committee.
Mr. Casey built the Senate's first World Wide Web page, for Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, in 1994, and is the author of a book, "The Hill on the Net: Congress Enters the Information Age." He said Washington's Internet community was relatively tight knit, though geographically dispersed.
Michael T. Hernon, 42, chief technology officer for the District of Columbia, agreed. "It's not as organized as in New York or Boston yet, but it's happening," said Mr. Hernon, who moved to Washington last year after three years as Boston's chief technology officer. "Every major technology company has a presence here, and on the Web development side, there is much more activity than I thought I'd find."
Indeed, the Netpreneur program has identified more than 1,000 new Internet-related companies in its data base. Among the companies is Sync, a small Internet broadcasting company based in College Park, Md. It specializes in "Webcasting" (the digital equivalent of sending video live over the Web) and Internet broadcast consulting.
In addition, it has produced or sponsored events ranging from Congressional hearings and speeches by Vice President Al Gore and Attorney General Janet Reno to independent films and the mildly controversial "Jenni Show," based on the voyeuristic Jenni Cam, a Web site on which a young woman keeps a camera in her bedroom to capture much of her life, which sometimes includes nudity and sex.
Thomas Edwards, president and chief executive of Sync, said that while New York's new-media sector benefited from having the advertising industry resident in the city, and Los Angeles could claim the entertainment industry, Washington and the surrounding area was experiencing new-media growth because of the Government.
"We're already a leading new-media center, and people don't realize it," he said. "It's much harder to find programmers now, people you used to able to get at $40,000, you now can't get for $80,000. That's a sign of real business."

HEADLINE: Long Boom or Bust;
A Leading Futurist Risks His Reputation With Ideas on Growth And High Technology

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Peter Schwartz is a professional marketer of big, brow-furrowing ideas. By 2020, he says, the internal combustion engine will probably have gone the way of the dodo bird as conventional automobiles are replaced by hybrid cars powered by fuel cells that mostly use hydrogen.
A telecommunications revolution, Mr. Schwartz believes, is coming even sooner. Thanks to big satellite projects, connections for high-speed Internet, telephone and video will be commonplace in six years or so. The world will be wired, inexpensively. By 2005, teen-agers in villages in developing countries will be chatting on video phones as they surf the Net. 
 By 2010, Mr. Schwartz predicts, breakthroughs in biotechnology and gene therapy may enable science to reverse aging and extend life. The prospect here, he insists, is not merely a prolonged old age but living for decades in one's biological 40's.
Yet these are mere ingredients of Mr. Schwartz's biggest idea, which he calls the "Long Boom." Its thesis is that the world is witnessing what Mr. Schwartz calls "the beginnings of a global economic boom on a scale never experienced before," driven by waves of fundamental technological change and free-market economics.
The Long Boom, which he sees running through about 2020, is a vision of almost unabashed technological optimism about the future from Mr. Schwartz, a leading futurist and chairman of the Global Business Network, a research and consulting firm. His manifesto first appeared as a cover story last summer in Wired magazine, whose pages generally celebrate the virtues of technology.
Ever since, he has found himself at the center of a spirited debate about technology and the future. Bearded, affable and articulate, Mr. Schwartz is a skillful salesman who has won supporters for his ambitious idea, but he has been roundly criticized as well.
In March, a loose-knit group calling itself the "Technorealism Project" emerged. Among the tenets proclaimed on its Web site at www.technorealism.org is the assertion, "The Internet is revolutionary, not utopian."
Andrew L. Shapiro, a fellow at the Harvard Law School's Center for the Internet and Society and a founder of the Technorealism Project, said, "We're just skeptical of the kind of sheer boosterism that Peter Schwartz is promoting."
Mr. Schwartz recently debated the merits of the Long Boom with Daniel Yankelovich, the public opinion analyst and president of Public Agenda, a research organization, at a conference in San Diego. In Mr. Yankelovich's view, the Long Boom betrays a "remarkable naivete" not only about technology but also about the working of market economics. "The market is great at distributing economic goodies," Mr. Yankelovich said, "but it doesn't have all these moral virtues that Peter Schwartz attributes to it."
Such reactions, Mr. Schwartz says, are precisely why he wrote the Long Boom. It has provoked thought and, he insists, changed the debate about the future. The Long Boom, he asserts, represents "a better vision of what could be if we make the right choices; it is what I think could and should happen."
As a futurist, Mr. Schwartz has impressive credentials. An alumnus of the Stanford Research Institute, now SRI International, he led a planning team at the Royal Dutch/Shell Group in London from 1982 to 1986. One of three possibilities drawn up in 1982 by Mr. Schwartz and his team was that oil prices would collapse.
That possibility was taken seriously by Shell's senior management, which piled up cash to prepare. After prices fell precipitously, Shell began a $3.5 billion buying spree in 1986, buying oilfields and locking in a long-term cost advantage over most of its rivals.
The Shell legacy gave Mr. Schwartz and four colleagues a head start in attracting corporate clients when they founded the Global Business Network in 1988. "Everybody wanted the Shell magic," he recalled.
The Global Business Network, known as GBN, is no ordinary consulting firm. Based in Emeryville, Calif., where it occupies a converted factory in the shadow of the Bay Bridge, GBN is eclectic if not eccentric. Its character is evident in the backgrounds of its five founders. Besides Mr. Schwartz, they are Jay Ogilvy, a former philosophy teacher at Yale University who headed values and life styles research at SRI International; Napier Collyns, who spent 30 years in Shell's planning group; Stewart Brand, creator of the Whole Earth Catalog and a founder of the Well computer network, and Lawrence Wilkinson, former president of Colossal Pictures.
Today, GBN is a small but thriving specialist firm. Compared with mainstream consultants like McKinsey & Company or Andersen Consulting, GBN is minuscule. Its revenues are running at $10 million a year, about double the level in 1994, while its staff has also doubled, to 55 people. (McKinsey says it has 4,500 consultants in 81 countries.)
GBN has roughly 100 clients, about half of which sent executives to the company's four-day annual conference in San Francisco last month. The client list is as eclectic as the firm, ranging from I.B.M. and AT&T to the Pentagon, the Government of Singapore and the National Education Association.
The conference concluded with an advance screening of the Dreamworks SKG movie "Deep Impact," which has since become a box-office hit. GBN worked with Dreamworks on developing the film, and Mr. Schwartz and a few other GBN members are mentioned in the film's credits.
The narrative spine of "Deep Impact" is how people behave in the months after they learn that a comet is going to collide with Earth. The movie, in essence, illustrates the fulcrum of scenario building -- a what-if question. And creating scenarios is GBN's specialty.
At the San Francisco conference, four scenarios for the next decade were presented as narratives for the participants to read and debate. They ranged from crisis and decline to an equivalent of the Long Boom, all rendered in imaginative detail.
In the gloom-and-doom scenario, for example, the year 2000 computer bug and global warming are culprits in the tailspin. The European Union is shattered, the Middle East has water shortages, oil prices surge and inflation is ignited. In 2003, the scenario said, "the Dow plummeted from 10,000 to 6,000 in a matter of months." In Mexico, the economy crumbles, South American drug cartels move in, guerrilla wars flare and refugees flood north. "In 2010," the scenario asserted, "President Wilson sent in the U.S. Army to establish order in Mexico."
Certainly provocative and undoubtedly more entertaining than most business reading, but what use is this kind of thing to corporations? Most companies say the GBN scenarios -- whether broad ones, like those presented at the San Francisco conference, or ones tailored for specific industries or nations -- are useful mainly as complementary planning tools.
The scenarios are built upon in-depth research of demographic, political and technology trends. Daniel McGrath, a business strategy consultant at I.B.M., said the scenarios then sketched out "causative chains that stretch your imagination and broaden your thinking."
GBN tries to broaden its own thinking through a network of about 100 people in diverse fields. They include Francis Fukuyama, the political scientist; Bruce Sterling, a science fiction writer, and Donella Meadows, an environmentalist. Yet the membership roster is heavy with technophiles including Danny Hillis, a computer scientist and research fellow at Walt Disney; Esther Dyson, an author and newsletter publisher, and John Gage, chief scientist at Sun Microsystems.
Another GBN member is Kevin Kelly, the executive editor of Wired. Both GBN and Mr. Schwartz personally were original investors in Wired, a fact not mentioned in the magazine when it published Mr. Schwartz's Long Boom article. "It's very incestuous in some ways," Mr. Schwartz allowed.
For $35,000 a year, corporate clients get to join the GBN network members on the company's private Web site to discuss all sorts of subjects, from the future of the car to computing's millennium bug.
In addition, clients are mailed two books a month, selected by Mr. Schwartz and Mr. Brand. "We've basically solved the problem of executives' reading guilt," Mr. Schwartz observed. Recent selections include "Remaking Eden," about cloning by Lee M. Silver, and "The Commanding Heights," a history of the triumph of free-market policies, by Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw.
GBN has prospered in recent years, partly because so many corporations, observing developments like the end of the cold war to the rise of the Internet, sense that change is accelerating. Divining traits of an uncertain future, more than ever, seems an essential corporate survival skill.
But GBN has also done a deft job of marketing its mainstay business of scenario building. "Scenarios have become the leading tool in thinking about the future, and GBN is the best at it," noted Michael Marien, editor of the Future Survey, a monthly newsletter.
A central tenet of the discipline, Mr. Schwartz wrote in his 1991 book, "The Art of the Long View," is that "scenarios are not predictions.
"It is simply not possible to predict the future with certainty," he wrote. "Rather, scenarios are vehicles for helping people learn." Scenarios are typically presented in groups of three or four, not alone.
Yet the Long Boom concept appears to be more a prediction than a scenario. And Mr. Schwartz, planning experts say, is taking a real risk with his reputation by championing the Long Boom. Professionals in the field of forecasting will talk cautiously about reducing uncertainty, while predictions suggest the hucksterish world of crystal balls, soothsayers and shamans.
"I think you are moving down a dangerous slope in this business if you become identified with one view of the future," said Paul Saffo, a director for the Institute of the Future, a research organization.
Mr. Schwartz acknowledges that risk, but he feels it is worth taking. "I wanted to influence the future," he said.
And Mr. Schwartz is an inherent optimist -- a trait reinforced by his personal life and his professional experience. His parents were survivors of Nazi concentration camps. Mr. Schwartz was born in a refugee camp in 1946, outside Stuttgart, Germany, and lived until he was 5 in a Norwegian refugee camp. His family then immigrated to New Jersey, living in one room of a brownstone.
His father, Benjamin, a self-trained engineer, quickly became a model of postwar upward mobility, steadily increasing his skills and income. He ended up designing advanced computer systems, and the family moved to a wealthy suburb of Philadelphia.
Professionally, Mr. Schwartz said, he has missed trends most often because of a failure to grasp the forces behind positive outcomes. In the early 1980's, he said, he consistently misread the outlook for the American economy because he failed to imagine the entrepreneurial effect of new industries led by the personal computer business.
"It was a big miss, and that was a real learning experience for me," he said.

Charts: "Some Visions'
Peter Schwartz foresees a long boom of growth driven by technology. Here are some of its ingredients:
 
By 2005, phone and high-speed Internet access for everyone.
By 2010, gene therapies to reverse aging.
By 2015, simultaneous language translation, made possible by computer chips 100 times more powerful than today's.
By 2020, the death of the internal combustion engine. Cars are powered by hydrogen fuel cells.
 
"Some Stumbles"
Though often prescient, Peter Schwartz has also misread the future:
 
In 1981, he was an author of a book that assumed oil prices were on their way to $85 a barrel.
In the early 1980's, he was too gloomy about the prospects for the American economy. He failed to understand the entrepreneurial impact of the PC industry.
In 1994, he missed the Mexican financial crisis. He was the host of a conference on Mexico's future a few weeks before, but did not consider the possibility.

Little Change Is Expected From F.T.C. Move on Intel
Intel, which has about 90 percent of the microprocessing market for personal computers, is facing its greatest level of competition in more than a decade. Yet, the Federal Trade Commission is preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit against Intel, accusing the company of abusing its position as the monopoly manufacturer of microprocessors and bullying some computer manufacturers. 
 Analysts believe the suit against Intel is less likely to change the competitive landscape in microprocessors than the pending action by the Justice Department and 20 states against Microsoft, which makes the Windows operating systems. Page D2.

HEADLINE: Travelers Deal With Nikko Set for Today

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
With the world's most powerful financial companies rushing to build global franchises, Travelers Group Inc. and the Nikko Securities Company are expected to announce today an extensive partnership in the securities business, with Travelers investing about $1.6 billion to acquire as much as a quarter of Japan's third-largest brokerage firm.
The deal -- which would also involve the Travelers brokerage subsidiary, Salomon Smith Barney, in forming a Japanese joint venture with Nikko -- is to be announced in Tokyo by Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Travelers, and Masashi Kaneko, the president of Nikko, at the end of the Japanese business day, executives involved in the negotiations said yesterday. 
 The last year has seen a blizzard of deal-making by Mr. Weill and Travelers, which acquired Salomon Inc. for $9 billion late last year, and then in April agreed to merge with Citicorp to form Citigroup in a pending $70 billion transaction. Competitors wonder how efficiently all these companies will work together.
A Travelers' investment in Nikko would be the first instance of a foreign company's buying a sizable stake in one of Japan's marquee financial names. It comes as Japan is preparing to open its financial markets in response to international pressure and to try to counter a prolonged economic downturn.
The investment, which would make Travelers the biggest shareholder in Nikko, shows how quickly national borders are breaking down in financial markets: even Japan, historically a protected market dominated almost exclusively by local brokerage firms, is now eager to embrace Wall Street investment and management.
Under the agreement, Nikko would join with Salomon's Japanese business to create Nikko Salomon Smith Barney Ltd., a joint venture, into which Nikko would put its capital markets and international businesses. The new joint venture company's chief executive would be Toshiharu Kojima, the head of Salomon's business in Japan, and it would be 51 percent owned by Nikko and 49 percent by Salomon, with each firm contributing six board members, according to the executives involved in the negotiations.
But Travelers through its investment in Nikko would be the more powerful partner. It would, under the accord to be announced today, buy 9.5 percent of Nikko's common stock, which has a current market value of about $540 million, and would also buy Nikko bonds that would be convertible into a further interest of about 15 percent of the brokerage firm, to give it about a 25 percent stake in the firm. Nikko is also expected to buy Travelers' shares in the open market to strengthen the link between the two companies.
Both companies declined to make any comment on their pending alliance over the weekend.
The Nikko investment carries big risks for Travelers, but also holds out the prospect of huge rewards if the joint venture works well and Travelers becomes the first American financial company to get extensive access to Japanese investors, who are currently estimated to have about $10 trillion of investments -- mostly invested in bank and savings deposits that yield less than 1 percent a year. Others are racing to try to reach the same goal in other ways; earlier this year, Merrill Lynch & Company bought some of the branches of the recently defunct Yamaichi Securities, and hired many of its former executives.
The Travelers' move, which is much larger than the Merrill Lynch investment, also comes soon after the big Japanese brokerage firms -- Nomura, Daiwa and Nikko -- have been found guilty of, and sanctioned for, paying bribes to sokaiya, as Japan's racketeers are known.
After weeks of examining Nikko, Travelers, and particularly its Salomon Smith Barney subsidiary, is betting that the Japanese firm has since cleaned up its operations and that Nikko will readily adapt to American standards of business practice and accounting in the new joint venture. Salomon and Nikko have, one insider said, already hired Davis, Polk & Wardell to write a new compliance code for the venture.
But it is unlikely that the culture of Japan's securities firms can be changed overnight. Until recently, industry analysts said, they did business in a cozy, protected and often corrupt world.
In March, Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating agency, lowered its rating for the senior debt of Nikko Securities, citing its concerns about the "relatively slow pace of introducing new products, rationalizing its expense base, and implementing efficient management tools."
In addition, Japan's financial markets are a complex web of entrenched relationships; it is unclear, for example, how the Mitsubishi Bank, which has historically been close to Nikko Securities, may react to Travelers' move.
But the pending alliance shows how eager Mr. Weill and his colleagues are to get access to the financial markets of the world's second largest economy, and its tens of millions of savers. Japanese investors are more interested in overseas investments, in part because their own institutions have generally offered them low-yielding investments and have been mired in scandal.
Under the pending agreement, Salomon would group its 700 employees in Japan with more than 600 from Nikko to form the core of the joint venture. Nikko would also merge its main international operations -- in New York, London and Hong Kong -- with those of Salomon Smith Barney. The new joint venture would begin operating in January 1999. Nikko, meanwhile, would retain its asset management and its network of offices in Japan that deal with ordinary investors. But these offices would offer financial products marketed by Travelers and later Citigroup.

HEADLINE: Top U.N. Inspector to Brief Security Council on Iraqi Failures to Provide Information

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
The chief United Nations arms inspector for Iraq plans to go to the Security Council on Wednesday with an unusually detailed technological accounting of what information Baghdad has failed to provide on biological, chemical and missile programs.
The briefing, by Richard Butler, executive chairman of the United Nations Special Commission charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, is intended to counter Iraq's assertions that it has met all disarmament demands. 
 The briefing, which several members of the 15-nation Security Council proposed, carries risks for Iraq, which wants eight-year-old sanctions lifted immediately, and the United States and Britain, which want tight controls to remain in place until Iraq has answered all outstanding questions and provided all missing documents on its weapons programs.
Washington also demands that Iraq meet other requirements such as accounting for more than 600 Kuwaitis missing since Iraq seized Kuwait in 1990.
If Mr. Butler provides enough evidence of Iraqi noncompliance, that could arrest growing sentiment in the council that the tight restrictions on Iraq have lasted long enough.
On the other hand, some diplomats say if the briefing really does lay out everything that Iraq needs to do to satisfy the inspectors, the details could give away intelligence information to the Iraqis, as well as allow them to find ways to appear to answer all outstanding questions with minimal compliance. Those experts cite the inspections of Iraqi Presidential properties in March and April as the sort of token compliance by Baghdad that makes it difficult for Washington and others to argue against Security Council members who urge an easing of sanctions.
The briefing on Wednesday grew out of a more generalized six-month Security Council review of sanctions that ended in April. The proposal for the briefing by several council members has been described as a "road map" for Iraq to follow to secure the lifting of at least the oil-sales embargo and the shifting of arms inspections from a search-and-destroy phase to long-term surveillance.
The end of sanctions would not mean the end of inspections, although independent arms-control experts said they believed that President Saddam Hussein might try to weaken the monitoring.
"The more the Security Council is in the picture, even on technical details, all the better," said Celso L. N. Amorim, the Brazilian representative on the Security Council and the originator of the "road map" tag. "I think it will be a good opportunity for us to assess concretely what is lacking, what are the concrete suspicions and what we can ask of Iraq."
"Conceptual pictures are useful, but I think in this particular case you need to have also very concrete landmarks," he said, adding that many council members, particularly small nations with rotating seats, did not have sources of intelligence on Iraq to help make judgments.
"We're not such a small country, but we don't have any presence in Iraq, for instance," Mr. Amorim, a former Foreign Minister, said. "I think for the council as a whole this will be very useful.
The council is to hold its next major review of sanctions on Iraq in October, when it is expected to move toward declaring Baghdad under long-term surveillance on nuclear arms, following the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency. But the recent nuclear tests by Pakistan, an Islamic country, and India, a longtime friend of Iraq, may give some members new qualms, some diplomats said.
In coming days the council will also consider a measure to allow Iraq to buy $300 million in equipment to upgrade its oil processing.
After the council agreed this year to more than double the value of the oil that Iraq can sell abroad to buy food, medicine and other civilian goods for a population that has suffered under the sanctions, Secretary General Kofi Annan has approved a plan for $4.5 billion in sales in the next six months.
Of that total $1.5 billion is to be set aside to compensate victims of the invasion of Kuwait, a requirement that rankles Baghdad.
Improved distribution is getting needed goods to Iraqis even before the higher figures kick in, the United Nations spokesman for humanitarian issues, Eric Falt, said on Thursday in Baghdad. Agriculture has begun to pick up in many areas with the supplying of fertilizers, spare parts for farm machinery and veterinary supplies, Mr. Falt said.
Nearly 200 of 600 requested ambulances have been delivered, he added, and the next oil-for-food distribution plan approved by Mr. Annan will raise caloric intake in the basic food basket distributed to every Iraqi.
But complications have arisen as the money for civilian imports increases. Recently the Government asked for a cellular telephone system, along with other communications equipment. United Nations officials and diplomats from the United States, Britain and other nations objected. The request was cut from the new plan, although the United Nations did say that experts would be sent to Iraq to assess the need.
"The Iraqi regime is obviously trying to get what it can out of this for the personal use of the leadership," a Western diplomat said. "This is precisely why there is hesitation about what we give Iraq, and why requests have to be gone through with a fine-tooth comb."

What Might Have Been

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

 BODY:
"We're increasing our gross national product every year, building a tremendous amount of wealth," the politician said, but that was not enough for "a country of great generosity and great spirit. I think people want to make a contribution to others. In the last few years we've lost sight of that."
Another time he said: 
 "Someone wrote on the pyramids when they were being constructed, 'No one was angry enough to speak out.' I think people should be angry enough to speak out. I think there are unfairnesses in my own country and around the world, and I think one should try to do something about it."
That was Robert Kennedy. It is hard to imagine a politician speaking that way today: promising no boon to the voters but challenging them to join in meeting the problems of America and the world.
"Look back at where our government came from," he said -- "the Greeks, with their idea of participation. Think of what Pericles said in his funeral oration, that we regard the individual who holds himself aloof from public affairs as being useless."
He graduated from Harvard 50 years ago this week. Thirty years ago this week he was assassinated.
In his 20 years of adult life -- just 20 -- he grew and changed as few of us do, least of all politicians. He started as the hard-boiled Senate investigator, the supposedly ruthless political strategist in his brother's Presidential campaign. He ended as the man who spoke for the powerless and the abused, in Harlem and the Appalachians and Vietnam.
Some thought it was President Kennedy's death that made him become sympathetic to the victims of injustice. But it was always there. He was a tenderhearted man who hid tenderness under a hard shell lest he be taken as weak.
But then in so many ways he was not like other political leaders. He was internal, often silent, communicating his empathy without words. He was gregarious and lonely, forceful and vulnerable, melancholy and funny, especially about himself.
This Sunday the Discovery Channel on cable television will show a three-part documentary based on Jack Newfield's book, "Robert F. Kennedy: A Memoir." It is a superb piece of work, bringing laughter and tears.
Before he became Attorney General, he said once, he had not thought about racial discrimination in this country. I asked him why he focused on it so forcefully after he was in the office.
"There are injustices," he said, "and they are flagrant. And I have the power and responsibility to do something about them. So I intend to do it. It's quite simple."
But of course it wasn't simple. Not everyone responds by committing himself when he sees others experiencing cruelty; most turn away and remain uninvolved. He responded.
"We don't have to agree with one another," he said. "This is a country of diversity. But there doesn't have to be the bitterness, there doesn't have to be the hatred, there doesn't have to be the distrust."
When Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed, on April 4, 1968, Robert Kennedy was campaigning in Indiana for the Democratic Presidential nomination. He went to a scheduled rally in Indianapolis, with a largely black audience that did not know the news. He told them. From memory, he quoted Aeschylus. Then he said: "So let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago, 'to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world.' "
There was a fateful quality in him, as if he knew the odds against making the world, in his words, a place of "compassion and love and peace." But he saw no alternative to trying.
"I think you have one time around," he said. "I don't know what's going to be in existence in six months or a year or two years. You have to feel that there are all these problems, that you are here on earth to make a contribution of some kind."
He went to South Africa in 1966, when the apartheid system was at its most oppressive. My wife, who was a South African student leader, speaks of the extraordinary impact his visit had. She was at the University of Cape Town when he said:
"Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope. And crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression."

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE KNOW-HOW;
U.S. and China Helped Pakistan Build Its Bomb

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a future Prime Minister of Pakistan, declared in 1965, "If India builds the bomb, we will eat grass or leaves -- even go hungry -- but we will get one of our own."
It required more than three decades, a global network of theft and espionage, and uncounted millions for Pakistan, one of the world's poorest countries, to explode that bomb. But it could not have happened without smuggled Chinese technology and contradictory shifts in American policy, according to present and former United States officials. 
 China, a staunch ally of Pakistan's, provided blueprints for the bomb, as well as highly enriched uranium, tritium, scientists and key components for a nuclear weapons production complex, among other crucial tools. Without China's help, Pakistan's bomb would not exist, said Gary Milhollin, a leading expert on the spread of nuclear weapons.
But the United States, a cold-war friend that turned its back on Islamabad when that long battle was over, pursued policies that proved almost as essential to the Pakistani bomb program as the uranium and tritium, some present and former Government officials say.
The United States provided Pakistani nuclear scientists with technical training from the 1950's into the 1970's. And it turned a blind eye to the nuclear weapons program in the 1980's, because Pakistan was providing the crucial link in the Central Intelligence Agency's effort to smuggle billions of dollars of weapons to Afghan guerrillas attempting to drive out Soviet invaders.
But when that covert operation ended, the United States cut off a multi-billion military aid program by imposing sanctions in the 1990's -- leaving Pakistan feeling defenseless.
"We have helped create the conditions that exist today for the big bomb," said Milt Bearden, who was a senior C.I.A. officer in Pakistan from 1986 to 1989. "Our marvelous sanctions forced their hand -- forced them to go where they are today."
Nicholas Platt, who was the United States Ambassador to Pakistan in 1991-92 and now serves as president of the Asia Society, said, "Our own policy, which denied them a credible conventional capability, has in a way forced them to rely more on the nuclear deterrent."
Pakistan's efforts to build the bomb began in the 1950's. Under the "Atoms for Peace" program, the United States agreed to train Pakistani scientists in nuclear-reactor technology. Washington also provided Pakistan's first research reactor and fuel. The training continued until 1972.
That year, shortly after a crushing defeat in its third war with India since the two nations were cut free from British colonial rule in 1947, Pakistan resolved never to suffer such humiliation again. In January 1972, Mr. Bhutto, by then Prime Minister, summoned his nation's best nuclear physicists and ordered them to build a bomb. Pakistan set up a world-wide smuggling ring to buy, copy or steal nuclear weapons technology, according to United States officials and declassified Government documents.
India tested a nuclear weapon in 1974, and Pakistan greatly intensified its efforts in response. The program was closely monitored by the United States military, intelligence and law-enforcement services -- so closely that President Jimmy Carter cut off all military and economic aid to Pakistan in April 1979, citing United States laws aimed at stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.
That decision was reversed nine months later, after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, which lies on Pakistan's border.
Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, agreed to smuggle weapons to the Afghans on behalf of the C.I.A. Suddenly Pakistan was the recipient of a six-year, $3.2 billion American aid package -- half cash, half high-tech weapons.
But in 1983, a secret State Department report said there was "unambiguous evidence that Pakistan is actively pursuing a nuclear weapons program." The report detailed how Pakistan had bought or stolen nuclear weapons technology around the world.
The report, based on information gathered by the C.I.A. and recently declassified, also said flatly that "China has provided assistance to Pakistan's program to develop a nuclear weapons capability."
The "unambiguous evidence" included Pakistan's secret blueprint for a nuclear bomb. That blueprint was made in China.
Pakistan had obtained the plans from the Chinese Government in the early 1980's. The bomb was simple and efficient, based on highly enriched uranium, and it had been tested by the Chinese in 1966. United States Government physicists built a model of the bomb and reported that it was a virtually foolproof design.
"The United States approached the Pakistani Government at the highest levels to communicate its extreme concern" over the nuclear-weapons program, the report said.
Mr. Bearden, the former C.I.A. officer stationed in Pakistan, recalled, "We went to them and said, 'Here is what your bomb looks like' -- even showed them a model, I believe."
But General Zia indicated his belief that he had the blessings of President Ronald Reagan and the Director of Central Intelligence, William J. Casey, to go ahead and build the bomb, according to two retired Pakistani military intelligence officials. The general clearly stated his intent in a 1986 interview. "It is our right to obtain the technology," General Zia said.
In 1985, Congress enacted a law requiring the President to certify that Pakistan was not building nuclear weapons and thus eligible for continuing military and economic aid. And every year from 1985 to 1990, Presidents Reagan and Bush certified just that.
"Reagan and Bush said it ain't a bomb until they turn that last screw and paint B-O-M-B on the side," Mr. Bearden said.
Everything changed after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, when Pakistan was no longer needed as the key link in the C.I.A.'s arms pipeline to Afghan rebels. In 1990, the United States finally acknowledged that the Pakistani nuclear weapons program existed -- and, under the law, cut off military aid.
This left Pakistan's armed forces, facing an Indian Army twice their size, without a reliable source of conventional weapons, like tanks and jets. It is still waiting for 28 F-16's, for which it paid the United States $650 million.
Beginning in 1990, Pakistan is believed to have built between 7 and 12 nuclear warheads -- based on the Chinese design, assisted by Chinese scientists and Chinese technology. That technology included Chinese magnets for producing weapons-grade enriched uranium, a furnace for shaping the uranium into a nuclear bomb core, and high-tech diagnostic equipment for nuclear weapons tests, according to the Monterey Institute of International Studies, which tracks the spread of nuclear weapons and technology.
Now, with last week's weapons tests, Pakistan faces fresh sanctions from the United States.
"Sanctions are such a blunt instrument that they could potentially ruin Pakistan's economy," said Mr. Platt, the former envoy to Pakistan.
That worries Mr. Bearden, the former C.I.A. officer. "We could destabilize Pakistan through sanctions," he said, "and that scares me more than anything."

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: IN INDIA;
India Calls for Talks On a Treaty to Limit All Atomic Arsenals

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 31

 BODY:
India appealed today for early negotiations on a new global treaty limiting nuclear arsenals that would include "all nuclear weapons states."
Indian officials said the term in the Foreign Ministry statement released today was intended to include India, Pakistan and possibly even Israel, as well as the five established nuclear powers: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. 
 "India calls on all nuclear weapons states and indeed the international community to join with it in opening early negotiations for a Nuclear Weapons Convention so that these weapons can be dealt with in a global, nondiscriminatory framework as other weapons of mass destruction have been, through the Biological Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention," the statement said.
India has made a similar proposal over many years, and has seen it rejected by the five established nuclear powers, since India wants all nuclear powers to agree to equal terms for capping and eventually eliminating their nuclear arsenals. The United States, in particular, has vigorously opposed this stipulation.
But Western diplomats said India's reformulation of the offer now -- after Pakistan's nuclear tests last week -- and its suggestion of early negotiations were a further sign that India was moving toward defusing the crisis that has gripped the subcontinent for the last three weeks since India's nuclear tests.
Along with the proposal for a new global nuclear weapons treaty, the Indian statement renewed other proposals for limiting the nuclear arsenals of India and Pakistan, and for reducing the threat of their being used. Those other proposals included a treaty that would bind the two nations not to be the first to use nuclear weapons against each other, and a commitment by India to join in negotiations under way in Geneva on an international treaty that would limit the production of "fissile material," or nuclear weapons fuel.
The statement also reiterated India's pledge to observe a "voluntary moratorium" on nuclear testing, a stand Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said last week was tantamount to observing the major provision of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that India shunned when it was concluded in 1994. Since Pakistan's tests, India has renewed its pledge not to resume its own. saying scientific data gathered in the five blasts it has said it conducted gave it the technological information it needs to perfect its nuclear warheads.
The diplomats said the proposals, through not new, were notable for the fact that they came a day after Pakistan conducted its second round of nuclear tests in 48 hours, without a significant Indian protest on either occasion. The Foreign Ministry statement also drew attention for its conciliatory tone toward Pakistan and China, the two nations India cited as security threats when it justified its own tests on May 11 and 13.
The statement said India "remains firmly committed to a policy of friendly and cooperative relations with all its neighbors, to the promotion of peace and stability in the region and to the resolution of all outstanding issues through bilateral dialogue and negotiations." And it disavowed any intention of threatening Pakistan.
In this, as in in its offer of new nuclear weapons talks, the Indian statement struck a tone markedly different from the one that was paramount in New Delhi in the first two weeks after India's tests. Several officials, led by the hard-line Interior Minister, Lal Krishna Advani, made statements that linked references to India's enhanced military power with threats to take military action over the disputed territory of Kashmir, causing fears in Washington and elsewhere that India might be on the verge of starting a war.
Prime Minister Vajpayee angered China by citing Beijing's growing arsenal of nuclear weapons, the unresolved border disputes between the two countries and China's history of transferring crucial nuclear weapons technology to Pakistan as the principal reasons why India decided to conduct the nuclear tests.
The Indian officials' remarks prompted opposition leaders to charge that Mr. Vajpayee was jeopardizing years of painstaking negotiations with China that had begun to show dividends in recent years, with growing cross-border trade and moves toward troop pullbacks in disputed areas.
The Indian statement came a day after the Foreign Ministers of the so-called Group of Eight nations -- Britain, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the United States and Russia -- announced that they would meet in London on June 12 to try to adopt a joint response to the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. So far, these nations have responded differently, with some, including the United States, imposing severe economic sanctions on the two countries and others, including Britain, France and Russia, condemning the tests but not joining the sanctions.
By offering to open talks on a new treaty, diplomats said India appeared to be making its opening bid for a settlement of the crisis. But apart from the resistance the Indian proposals seemed likely to face from the established nuclear powers, they seemed certain to encounter resistance from Pakistan. For one thing, Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Gohar Ayub Khan, said in Islamabad today that any talks on the nuclear crisis involving India and Pakistan would have to tackle the Kashmir issue first.
The issue has bedeviled every attempt to normalize relations between the two countries for half a century. With Indian troops occupying two-thirds of Kashmir and fighting a war against Pakistan-backed insurgents, India has insisted that the territory it controls is a permanent part of India. But Pakistan insists that the Muslim majority in Kashmir should have the right promised to them in United Nations resolutions in 1947 and 1948, that of choosing whether they want to be part of India or Pakistan.
Mr. Ayub Khan, who is the son of Pakistan's first military ruler, Mohammad Ayub Khan, also suggested that one of the Indian proposals, for a "no first use" agreement on nuclear weapons between the two countries, would be impractical.
He said the idea had originated during the cold war, and was useful when it applied to the arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union, which were sufficiently distant from each other to allow time to react to a surprise attack. In the case of India and Pakistan, he said, the distances were so small -- New Delhi and Islamabad are only 375 miles apart -- that there would be no buffer.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Nazis Used Gold Loot To Pay for War

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
In a highly anticipated report on the fate of Nazi gold, United States Government historians have concluded that much of the looted wealth was routed through Switzerland to pay other neutral nations for vital supplies that sustained Hitler's army in the last years of World War II.
The report, to be issued on Tuesday, also doubles the American estimate of how much gold was in a Nazi account that received deposits of wedding rings, teeth fillings and other personal possessions of Holocaust victims. 
 But the report also spells out for the first time the crucial role that looted gold -- from individual victims and from the central banks of countries invaded by Germany -- played in securing a huge share of Nazi war needs purchased from Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Turkey.
A draft of the report obtained by The New York Times, sections of which were obtained from several agencies involved in its preparation, concludes that Portugal and Spain provided Germany with "almost 100 percent" of the essential minerals needed to produce "machine tools and armaments, especially armor-piercing shells." But the draft stops short of concluding that their help prolonged the war.
Even before the final 200-page report is published, it has set off arguments and debate both inside and outside the Government. Jewish groups and others engaged in legal battles with the Swiss Government and the country's three major banks say they are concerned that the State Department is trying to appease Switzerland by spreading the guilt for dealing in what has come to be known as Nazi gold.
American diplomats have been trying for a year to defuse Swiss anger over a May 1997 report that, in graphic detail, described how Switzerland aided Hitler and stymied efforts to recover the Nazis' stolen gold after Germany's surrender.
While the new report repeatedly praises Switzerland for its efforts during the last year to confront its own history, Clinton Administration officials say their main goal was to complete the historical record about how the looted gold was spent.
Drafts of the report suggest that as State Department officials fine-tuned their conclusions there was considerable internal debate over how to deal with Switzerland. An early draft of the introduction prepared by Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs, referred to the Swiss as "courageous" for conducting a "searching national debate" about their country's wartime role.
The final version deletes the word "courageous."
That may prove an important deletion. Since the American report went to press, Switzerland's Government-run central bank defiantly announced that it would not join negotiations to compensate Holocaust survivors for stolen gold deposited in its vaults -- even though Switzerland's own historical commission, in a report last week, concluded that the Swiss National Bank knowingly accepted stolen gold from the Nazis worth billions in today's dollars.
The Administration's report breaks new historical ground in several areas. Roughly $300 million in looted Nazi gold, worth $2.6 billion today, was used to pay Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Turkey for war materiel. The report concludes that "three quarters of this amount was transferred from Germany through the Swiss National Bank."
While the report steers clear of saying so, that finding appears to increase enormously the potential liability of the Swiss National Bank in the current dispute about compensation for Holocaust survivors. Under postwar agreements, countries that first received stolen assets from Nazi Germany were financially responsible for their return, not those to whom the assets were later transferred.
In another finding, historians now believe that more than $40 million, measured in today's dollars, was in the infamous "Melmer Account." The account, named for the German S. S. officer who administered it, contained gold bars made from the smelted tooth fillings, wedding bands and other personal effects taken from Holocaust victims -- and sometimes swept out of the death camp ovens.
Previous estimates were around $20 million, but the account itself is believed to have contained only a fraction of the full amount looted from individuals. The reassessment was based on newly found records in a private collection in Vienna and on corporate records recently reviewed at Degussa, the German precious-metals concern that smelted Nazi loot into gold bars during the war.
The report also says that two major German banks, Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank, sold gold from the Melmer Account in Turkey to supply Germany with hard currency. Neither bank has been named in the class-action suit against Swiss banks, nor has either one been involved in negotiations over compensation of victims. But this finding seems likely to involve those banks, which have substantial operations in the United States, in the compensation debate.
Swiss officials have looked forward for some time to the publication of the report, whose title -- "U.S. and Allied Wartime and Postwar Negotiations with Argentina, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Turkey on Looted Gold and German External Assets" -- suggests that the focus is on how others tilted "neutrality" toward Nazi Germany. The Clinton Administration is also setting up a Presidential commission to examine assets that may have been hidden in American banks.
Elan Steinberg, a top executive of the World Jewish Congress, said on Friday that while he has yet to see the report, "we are concerned because Swiss officials have repeatedly told us that the upcoming report was designed to take pressure off them." But he said the secretary general of the World Jewish Congress, Israel Singer, had been told by Mr. Eizenstat that "this is not the case."
Mr. Steinberg, whose group is a central player in the negotiations to force Swiss banks to make restitution to Holocaust victims and their survivors, concludes that "the irony is that the report would seem to assess greater financial responsibility on Switzerland than was first thought."
The report concludes that unlike Switzerland, most of the other "neutral" countries -- especially Sweden -- fulfilled their postwar agreements to pay back looted gold and a portion of other assets in their possession at the end of the war. While the report refers to American negotiations with Switzerland to insure the return of the vast majority of the gold as a "debacle," it does not advocate enforcing an accord reached in 1946, a step that would cost Switzerland billions of dollars.
Swiss officials are desperately trying to avoid a reopening of that agreement. But on Friday, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican whose hearings two years ago began the torrent of revelations about Nazi gold, said that the United States should "reopen the 1946 accords, with a view toward achieving an agreement by which Switzerland would restore all the looted gold it received."
The core of the new report is a chapter-by-chapter recitation of how the "neutrals" aided both Hitler and the Allies, and profited handsomely by playing the needs of one off of the other. Turkey's gold reserves, for example, went from 27 tons before the war to 216 tons by the end.
But it also raises harsh questions about their actions after Germany's defeat. "If neutrality was defended during the war as a way of self-defense," the report concludes, "why was there so little cooperation with the Allies after the war in returning looted Nazi assets" for the benefit of refugees and the reconstruction of Europe?
At the end of the war, less than $20 million of the $240 million in looted gold acquired by the neutrals, other than Switzerland, was returned. Switzerland returned only $58 million of the booty it retained, which the Swiss historical commission now believes exceeded $300 million.
The report faults the United States for not pressing hard enough -- in part because of concerns about not offending nations deemed important to building alliances against the Soviets -- though it notes that the Treasury Department urged the Truman Administration to take a far harder line. It was overruled.
But the hardest questions remain for Switzerland, which turned over only $28 million in German assets, other than gold, out of $250 million to $750 million that it possessed at the end of the war.
"The approach of the new millennium offers a clear window of opportunity to act," Mr. Eizenstat's report concludes, calling on all of the nations involved to speed up efforts to come to "a moral accounting of this lingering ledger of grief."

HEADLINE: CLINTON ENDORSES I.M.F. PLAN TO HELP RUSSIA PAY DEBTS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
Fearing a meltdown of the Russian currency that could threaten the stability of President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government, President Clinton said today that the United States would support new international financial aid if Russia is unable to meet its short-term debts.
Mr. Clinton's statement, made after a tumultuous week in which investors fled the Russian ruble, appeared to pave the way for a new bailout of Russia by the International Monetary Fund. While American officials refused to talk about the size of any new program, or when it might begin, outside experts said Russia could need upward of $10 billion to make up for huge shortfalls in oil revenues and tax collections. 
 If an emergency package is required, it would mark the fourth time in nine months that the monetary fund has been called in to cobble together a bailout plan for a nation in the face of market panic. The fund is already administering huge loan programs in response to problems in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea.
Mr. Clinton's statement was released by the White House this morning after a frenzied series of meetings and telephone calls that included discussions between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin and between Vice President Al Gore and the Russian Prime Minister, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, as well as a visit with United States Treasury officials by Anatoly B. Chubais, the former Deputy Prime Minister and one of the chief architects of Russia's economic reforms.
Mr. Clinton's statement was clearly timed to precede the opening of markets in Asia and then in Moscow on Monday morning and to head off the kind of sell-off that rocked Russia last week. But the statement was deliberately vague. It said simply that the United States would endorse "additional conditional financial support from the international financial institutions, as necessary, to promote stability and structural reform in Russia."
The new I.M.F. loans, if forthcoming, could be used to support the ruble in foreign exchange markets, to replace high-interest-rate loans with lower-cost borrowing from the monetary fund, or to meet budgetary shortfalls. But like all I.M.F. money, it would come with strict conditions -- and the fund has been in a tug-of-war with Russia for two years over its willingness to meet those conditions. The fund, for example, is supposed to consider in coming days whether to deliver nearly $670 million in payments that were suspended earlier this year because Russia was not fulfilling promises to collect taxes.
A senior Administration official told reporters today that the United States does not envision direct support to Russia of the kind provided to Mexico during the 1995 peso crisis. Instead, the aid would flow through the monetary fund and the World Bank. The United States provides a little less than one-fifth of the funds to each institution.
"It is too early to know amounts or precise methods, which will depend very much on how the situation evolves," the senior official said.
In the case of Mexico and in the Asian crisis, Washington's interests were primarily economic: stopping a "contagion effect" that could lead investors to stampede out of emerging markets around the world. American officials say they have some of the same concerns in Russia.
But the Administration's main motivations are political: If Russia was forced to devalue the ruble, it would strike a huge blow to the stability of the Yeltsin Government.
"The Indonesians, the Koreans and the Thais weren't sitting on tens of thousands of nuclear weapons," one State Department official said late last week, as rumors of a bailout plan for Russia were first heard. "The disaster here would be an economic meltdown that aided Yeltsin's enemies on the right."
The Administration's hope -- as it was in Asia -- is that even a vague announcement of support would be enough to calm the markets. The idea is that once investors realize that the United States and the monetary fund have determined that Russia is too important to fail, they will stop dumping the ruble and pulling their portfolios out of Russia.
It is a form of deterrence theory for an economic age. It is a strategic bet that if there is a promise to commit billions of dollars to save Russia, the markets will be scared to attack the ruble and the monetary fund will never have to launch billions of dollars in loans from its vaults.
But the fund's record is spotty. In South Korea, it took two bailout plans -- and a brush with national default -- before the markets stabilized. And in recent weeks labor unrest has sent the stock market to an 11-year low.
In Indonesia, the fund put together three plans, each of which failed to do the job -- two because President Suharto refused to enact important reforms and the last because he was swept out of office. On Monday morning, the fund's board will consider what Indonesia needs now that the economy is unraveling faster than ever.
The discovery by investors that the financial crisis in Asia is far from over was part of Russia's problem last week. It got caught in the latest stampede out of emerging market currencies. But there are also problems specific to Russia.
Oil revenues have fallen along with worldwide oil prices, and the Government is still unable to generate the political power needed to collect taxes from the country's richest companies -- to say nothing of individual taxes. That failure led to a suspension of its previous I.M.F. package, a $9.2 billion loan program tied to wide-ranging economic reforms.
"All this taken together led to what can be described as a crisis of confidence," Prime Minister Kiriyenko said on Russian television today.
American officials say they are impressed with Mr. Kiriyenko's reform plans and his resolve. But they are clearly uncertain whether he has the power to enact the most politically painful steps -- starting with tax enforcement -- and whether Mr. Yeltsin will completely back him.
Restoring market confidence, however, is clearly linked to Mr. Kiriyenko's ability to finesse a series of financial deadlines.
At a time when revenues are scarce, Russia must find a way to pay or refinance more than $5 billion in debt, mostly accounted in rubles, by the end of June. Over the longer term, it must pay back roughly $145 billion in foreign debt -- not a huge figure as a proportion of the country's economy, but a daunting one at a time when foreign lending has dried up and Russia's foreign currency reserves have fallen to around $10 billion.
Those reserves could be eaten away further by the 150-percent interest rates the Russian central bank is paying for overnight loans, another part of the effort to stabilize the currency.
Russian authorities appear determined to prevent a devaluation of the ruble, which would send the price of many goods soaring. Both Russian and American officials seem convinced that the stability of Mr. Yeltsin's Government is directly tied to the stability of the ruble. A senior Administration official said today that the United States viewed propping up the ruble as "an appropriate strategy."
The question over the next week or two is whether it is a realistic one. Investors and currency traders may read Mr. Clinton's statement and retreat for a while, bringing some stability to the markets. But sooner or later, they are bound to test Russia's resolve to support its currency, and with it that of the I.M.F. and the United States.

HEADLINE: Russian Premier Sees No Need For More Crisis Loans 'So Far'

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 31

 BODY:
Russia's Prime Minister said in a television interview tonight that the country "so far" did not need emergency international loans to pull itself out of its financial crisis.
President Clinton said today that the United States would support new international financial assistance for Russia if it was unable to meet short-term debts. Although the interview with Prime Minister Sergei V. Kiriyenko, broadcast tonight on a popular Sunday news program, had been taped before Mr. Clinton's statement, the President's support had been sought by key members and backers of the Russian Government. 
 The most important reaction to Mr. Clinton's statement, though, was expected to come on Monday morning, in the response of Russian financial markets to the United States' endorsement of more help for Russia.
That news follows an announcement on Friday that a new installment of a $10 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund had been approved for Russia on the basis of the Government's latest plan to reduce its deficit.
Mr. Kiriyenko's comments are in keeping with a strategy in which Russia has maintained a public distance from the quest for foreign help, even as it privately solicited support for credits that could be turned into hard cash if the crisis resumes.
In the interview tonight on the news program Itogi, Mr. Kiriyenko said the way for Russia to emerge from the crisis was "to raise revenues and cut expenditures." Asked if Russia would borrow money from abroad, he answered, "So far, no; as of today, there is no necessity for this."
Recalling how he and his wife had made ends meet during their student days, Mr. Kiriyenko, 35, said he considered borrowing a last resort. "Because you can go and borrow from the neighbors," he said, "but it only aggravates the situation, because tomorrow, besides buying the new fridge, daily food and children's clothes, you will have to return the debt to the neighbor. The situation will only worsen."
At a news conference last week, Deputy Finance Minister Oleg V. Vyugin said that while Russia might not need additional credits, they would help in calming markets made jittery by this month's crash. "I don't see how such a decision would hurt," he said.
Top officials, in televised interviews today, played down a trip to Washington this week by former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais. They said only that Mr. Chubais, an economic reformer with a good reputation abroad, was well positioned to explain the situation in Russia to Western investors.
But Russian officials said privately that Mr. Chubais, who now is in charge of Russia's largest electricity company, had been assigned together with a top Government aide, Sergei Vasileyev, to present Russia's case to American officials. President Boris N. Yeltsin made his own calls last week to Mr. Clinton and to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, asking for their help in his battle to defend the ruble.
In his interview tonight, Mr. Kiriyenko, who has been in office just one month, said the crisis had posed a test of confidence for the Government, which in recent years has continued to spend more than it raised. "Each time the deficit was covered with new debts, and all that began to pile up to dangerous levels," he said.

In 1981, a newly inaugurated President Reagan proudly announced plans to cut taxes, boost defense spending and balance the Federal budget within three years through "additional savings to be proposed" later. In fact, the Reagan team had been unable to agree on just what to cut, so that little line was an effort to finesse the problem.
"I buried it way down at the bottom of the white paper appendix table," recalled David Stockman, a young Midwestern Congressman whose devotion to slashing Federal spending had propelled him into the White House as President Reagan's budget director. "If you had a magnifying glass, you could read it." 
 It worked, at least politically. Taxes were cut and defense spending raised. But those "additional savings" never did get identified, for the same reason they were not cited at the beginning. There were no cuts that could be made without unacceptable political cost.
Since the Republicans took control of Congress in 1994, they have been reluctant to play similar games. Previous budget proposals by the House Budget Committee chairman, John Kasich of Ohio, openly targeted areas that he would like to cut, whatever the political risks. But this year he reverted to Stockman-like tactics.
Mr. Kasich himself favored an ambitious list of cuts -- eliminating the Energy and Commerce Departments, privatizing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, wiping out the Legal Services Corporation, trimming Medicare and Medicaid, and abolishing a tax break for low-income couples without children. But his colleagues had no appetite for the combat these proposals would bring. The result is a budget that pretends savings have been found, though they have not been. On paper, that frees up money for a big tax cut that some Republicans think will be a great campaign issue, and leaves the actual cuts until later.
This page would oppose most of the cuts Mr. Kasich had in mind, but it would not question the honesty of the budget he was pushing. The budget approved by his committee and scheduled for a vote soon by the full House fails the basic integrity test, and the House should vote it down, demanding instead a budget that is real, not rigged.
In his memoirs, Mr. Stockman wrote that he knew huge deficits would be coming if spending was not slashed far beyond any proposals the Reagan Administration was willing to make. But he thought that fact "would become a powerful battering ram" to force future spending cuts.
There was no battering ram. Deficits ballooned, and not until this year was a surplus achieved through spending restraint, tax increases, increased tax revenues from a strong economy, falling interest rates that slashed the Treasury's cost of borrowing and good luck. The political promise of a big tax cut should not seduce House Republicans into embracing an old and failed strategy.

HEADLINE: PRIMARIES '98: THE POLITICAL VETERAN;
Last in Flash and Cash, an Underdog Pulls Ahead

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 31

 BODY:
For months, as he struggled against richer and splashier rivals for the Democratic nomination for governor here, Lieut. Gov. Gray Davis was Rodney Dangerfield, in perpetual quest of respect. But as he basked the other day in the support of Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. of San Francisco, the coolest cat in California politics, Mr. Davis, surely among the squarest, suddenly seemed hep.
"I don't want to say that Willie has a blank check," Mr. Davis said of his loyalties if elected, prompting a group of supporters outside San Francisco's elegant City Hall to explode in laughter at the thought of what the famously wily Mr. Brown could make of such a promise. "It wouldn't be cautious, and I'm supposed to be cautious." 
 Still, despite his reputation, Mr. Davis could not resist proclaiming himself "on the verge of a great victory" in the primary election on Tuesday, and indeed all the polls show that he has opened a commanding lead over his rivals, Representative Jane Harman and Al Checchi, the multimillionaire former co-chairman of Northwest Airlines. And that is the sweetest sort of vindication for Gray Davis, a 23-year veteran of state politics who is often dismissed by party insiders and pundits as aptly named.
"This has been a very trying election," Mr. Davis said at a meeting of the League of United Latin American Citizens in Long Beach on Saturday. "I've had more political pundits tell me that I was dead meat, couldn't win, road kill, forget it, give it up, sayonara, forget it, Charlie, go home. So it's particularly reassuring to know that even though I'm running against someone with more money than Fort Knox, and a very good Congresswoman that's got quite a bit of money herself, the candidate with the least money is in the lead."
There is more than a little irony in that, because Mr. Davis has had a reputation as a relentless fund-raiser in four years as Lieutenant Governor, eight years as state controller and four years as a state assemblyman from the West Side of Los Angeles. He will probably equal or break the record for spending in a primary for governor here, the $9 million that Kathleen Brown spent four years ago. Ms. Harman is expected to spend nearly twice that, and Mr. Checchi more than four times as much, in the all-time American record for a non-Presidential race.
But Mr. Davis is also benefiting from his years as an unabashed political networker, the sort of man who passes out his business cards at the Vanity Fair Academy Awards party and spends every weekend on the rubber-chicken circuit. He has won the support of labor unions, old-line liberals and party regulars like Mr. Brown, groups that can still help turn out voters in a fractured political climate almost completely dominated by television advertising. He and his labor allies are organizing joint get-out-the-vote efforts to defeat a ballot proposition that would require unions to obtain written consent of their members before using union dues for political purposes, and polls show that opposition to that measure has grown just as support for Mr. Davis has risen.
Then, too, with California on the rebound from years of economic, natural and social disasters, voters apparently find Mr. Davis's steady, well-honed resume appealing. He has maintained favorability ratings of 2 to 1 or better throughout most of the campaign, and he leads his Democratic rivals among virtually all ethnic and age groups. A recent Los Angeles Times poll found that voters preferred a candidate with years of elective experience by more than 2 to 1 over a contender, like Mr. Checchi, with no political experience but years in business.
"Voters overwhelmingly wanted experience all along," Mr. Davis's pollster, Paul Maslin, said last week. At various points, Mr. Maslin added, voters seemed unaware of Mr. Davis's candidacy, in part because he could not afford to begin television advertising as early as his rivals did. But the moment Mr. Davis did begin running commercials last month, with the slogan, "Experience money can't buy," he edged ahead of Mr. Checchi and Ms. Harman and has solidified his lead ever since.
As Davis strategists note, despite its go-go reputation, California has been governed for the last 16 years by stolid Republicans, Pete Wilson and George Deukmejian, who would never dominate charisma contests. Not since the days of Edmund G. Brown Jr., for whom Mr. Davis began his career as chief of staff in 1975, has the state had a media star in Sacramento. Garry South, Mr. Davis's campaign manager, likes to say that past governors "look a hell of a lot more like Gray Davis than Al Checchi or Jane Harman."
Although Mr. Davis, 55, has been a fixture in California politics -- courting Hollywood donors, playing golf with President Clinton, drawing criticism for crashing other politicians' events to find contributors and for sometimes blending fund-raising with his official duties -- he is a private and somewhat enigmatic figure. Despite his liberal reputation, he is considerably more conservative than Mr. Brown, having long supported the death penalty, for example.
Born Joseph Graham Davis Jr., the son of an advertising executive for Time Inc., Mr. Davis grew up in Connecticut and came to California at age 11 when his father moved west with the company. But his father was an alcoholic and his parents divorced in his sophomore year at Stanford University, and Mr. Davis joined the Reserve Officers Training Corps so he could afford to stay in school. It was an important decision, because Mr. Davis wound up as an Army captain in Vietnam, where he won the Bronze Star and was struck by the disproportionate number of minority members among the American troops there, an injustice that helped propel him into politics.
For years, Mr. Davis has been laying the groundwork for a bid for governor, but some party strategists have seen him as too pallid, with his perfectly combed gray hair and sometimes funereal demeanor, to compete effectively against the certain Republican nominee, State Attorney General Dan Lungren, a genial conservative in the Reagan mold. But Mr. Davis leads Mr. Lungren in hypothetical matchups in the polls, and in recent days, he has wasted no time in looking ahead to the general election.
In his speech to the Hispanic group in Long Beach, Mr. Lungren's hometown, Mr. Davis sketched out his rhetorical strategy against the Attorney General, who avoided military service in the Vietnam era because of a sports injury to his knee, warning, "Dan Lungren is in for the fight of his life; Dan Lungren has never been tested; Dan Lungren is going to run against a Vietnam veteran."
Asked afterward by reporters whether he intended to fault Mr. Lungren for his lack of military service, Mr. Davis said no, and then added in good-natured but evident frustration, "Look, you people think I'm some sort of..." before breaking off mid-sentence to add calmly, "You do not understand the level of trust that has been generated between the people of this state and me over 23 years."

HEADLINE: With a Hometown Embrace, Pataki Begins His Campaign

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: PEEKSKILL, N.Y., May 31

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki returned to his hometown today to kiss his mother, shake dozens of sweaty hands, recite his accomplishments and formally announce his campaign for re-election.
It was a euphoric moment for Mr. Pataki, who was largely unknown and struggled to be taken seriously when he emerged four years ago as the Republican challenger to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat of national stature seeking his fourth term. 
 As supporters shook signs bearing his name, Mr. Pataki discussed one of his favorite topics -- his modest upbringing as a mailman's son -- and reminded the crowd that "seemingly ordinary people" are "capable of extraordinary feats of greatness."
"We have unleashed the strength and the spirit of our people," said Mr. Pataki, 52, whose strength in suburbs and small upstate towns helped him defeat Mr. Cuomo in 1994. "That is why the great march of progress that began four years ago must march on for another four years."
Hundreds of families came to glimpse the Pataki family at the Peekskill Riverfront Green Park, which Mr. Pataki helped create when he was Mayor here in the 1980's. They ate watermelon, drank soda and listened to the chipper Peekskill High School band, which played Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture." "Yonkers Loves Pataki" banners waved and "Start Me Up," a Rolling Stones song, blared as the Governor, his wife, Libby, and two of their four children climbed onto an outdoor stage.
Campaign workers scrambled through the crowd, urging people to wave their signs more vigorously and shout, "Four more years!"
The announcement came four days before the Republican State Convention in Manhattan, at which party delegates from around the state will officially nominate Mr. Pataki as the Republican gubernatorial candidate and Mary O. Donohue, an upstate judge, as his new running mate. Not coincidentally, it also came one day before his new book, "Pataki, an Autobiography," is to arrive in bookstores around the nation and Mr. Pataki is to appear on "The Montel Williams Show" to discuss the book.
But despite those early efforts to grab voters' attention, Mr. Pataki said today that he would not start campaigning in earnest until this summer. He said he would spend the next month pressuring the State Legislature to pass bills that are important to him, including one that would end parole for violent felons and another that would increase the number of poor children eligible for free health insurance.
"That's my focus," he said. "Getting through as much change as possible in the next three or four weeks while the Legislature is still in session, and then we're on to the campaign."
However, Mr. Pataki gave what could only be described as a stump speech today, talking for nearly 15 minutes about his changes to state welfare policy, his tax cuts and New York's booming economy. He said the state's welfare rolls had fallen by 500,000 people since he took office in 1995 and 300,000 more people had jobs. The Governor, known for his lack of charisma, sounded uncharacteristically spirited as he mentioned that violent crime statewide had dropped to its lowest level in 28 years, and that more state aid than ever was flowing into public schools.
At least two Democratic candidates -- Peter F. Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker, and Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney -- are scheduled to compete in the gubernatorial primary in September in hopes of challenging Mr. Pataki. Two others -- Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, who switched parties after feuding with Mr. Pataki, and James L. Larocca, a former state Transportation Commissioner, have said they will petition to get on the ballot.
But none of the four has the stature or financial resources of Mr. Pataki, who has an astounding $12 million in his campaign chest already. Much of that money was raised by United States Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New York, a fellow Republican, who plucked Mr. Pataki from obscurity in 1994, when Mr. Pataki was a State Senator, and orchestrated his political ascent. Both men are seeking re-election this year, and in a role reversal, Mr. D'Amato is counting on Mr. Pataki's popularity to improve his own prospects in some parts of the state.
If Mr. Pataki felt giddy today, he probably felt even more so on Saturday, when Henry A. Kissinger, giving the commencement address at Albany Law School, said he expected to see Mr. Pataki's name on the presidential ticket in 2000. Although the Governor skirted reporters' questions about his national political aspirations today, he was clearly savoring Mr. Kissinger's remarks.
"It's very nice when someone with the stature of Henry Kissinger says you should be on a national ticket," he told reporters after his speech. "It is of course a compliment and I take it as such."
Lesser-known admirers of Mr. Pataki were just as eager to praise him today in Peekskill, about 30 miles north of New York City, describing him in words that would make his strategists glow and his opponents roll their eyes. This was friendly territory, after all.
"He's a guy you could trust to baby-sit your kids, just a sweetheart of a guy," crowed Bill Noel, an insurance broker from nearby Carmel whose wife volunteered for Mr. Pataki's 1994 campaign. "A simple Peekskill boy, no pretense, down to earth."
Bill Leavy, a retired police officer from Yonkers, said he had not personally benefited from Mr. Pataki's policies and described the Governor as "average." Nonetheless, Mr. Leavy said he would vote for Mr. Pataki in November because "he gets the job done." His daughter Laurie Leavy said she would vote for Mr. Pataki after watching him today.
"He kissed a lot of people," she said. "You've got to give him credit for seeming like a nice guy."

HEADLINE: PRIMARIES '98: THE GOVERNOR'S RACE;
MONEY AND POLLS TAKE CENTER STAGE IN CALIFORNIA RACE

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 31

 BODY:
After the most high-priced and volatile primary campaign in California history, this state's voters will pick nominees for Governor on Tuesday in an election that has rekindled a debate over the potency of television commercials and underscored the perils for wealthy candidates who finance their own campaigns.
With Dan Lungren, the State Attorney General, facing token opposition for the Republican nomination for Governor, the Democratic race has overwhelmed the political landscape. Tussles over the dominant issues of education and crime have largely been submerged by a competition defined by huge sums of money and wild gyrations in the polls that have startled even jaded politicians. 
 In the past month or so, each of the three principal contenders for the nomination has at one point or another been in first -- and last -- place in the polls. Most spectacular has been the downward trajectory of Alfred A. Checchi, a political newcomer and the former co-chairman of Northwest Airlines. He has pumped roughly $40 million into his campaign -- more than any other non-Presidential candidate has ever spent on a primary and general election combined -- only to see his first-place position in the polls plunge to a distant third, behind Gray Davis, the Lieutenant Governor and front-runner, and Representative Jane Harman.
No matter the outcome on Tuesday, Mr. Checchi has heralded a new political dynamic in this state that pioneered the "virtual campaign," in which elections are fought only on the airwaves: the more money he pours into television commercials, the worse he seems to do.
"It's an extraordinary case of an inverse relationship between advertising and results," said Mervin Field, a veteran pollster here. "It's going to be the kind of story they'll put in advertising textbooks because everyone thinks if you put more money in advertising it sells more."
Besides voting for nominees to succeed Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican who is barred by law from a third term, and a challenger for Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat, Californians will decide two ballot initiatives that have far-reaching implications for the future of bilingual education and the power of unions in this country.
Beyond California, Tuesday will be one of the busiest primary days of the year. In a crucial test of the strength of religious conservatives, Gov. Fob James Jr. of Alabama will try to stave off serious opposition in the Republican primary. In Iowa, both parties are choosing nominees for the open Governor's seat, a post that will be particularly important in 2000 given Iowa's pivotal role in the Presidential primary season. Voters also go to the polls in Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota.
With the hardy economy taking the issue of jobs off the table in most states, many politicians find themselves turning their attention to education. Candidates have been wrangling over proposals to inject more money into rebuilding deteriorating schools, improving the standards for hiring teachers -- as well as proposals to give parents a wider choice of options in their children's education.
Here in California, polls show that the ballot proposal to end bilingual education appears headed for approval. But voters in recent days have begun to turn against the other initiative, strenuously fought by organized labor, that would require unions to get written consent from members before spending their dues on political campaigns. Governor Wilson has staked his political prestige, and possible White House ambitions, on passage of the measure.
The contest to succeed Governor Wilson may be the most consequential American election this year because it represents the Democrats' best opportunity to pick up a big-state governorship. The stakes are particularly high because if Democrats maintain dominance in the legislature and capture the Governor's office, they will control redistricting for 2002 in the state with the most House seats.
The small percentage of eligible voters who are expected to go to the polls will also have to sort through 87 candidates for statewide office and nine ballot initiatives. In San Francisco, the absentee ballot is the size of a small telephone book: 176 pages. There are so many choices, in fact, that election officials expect many voters to give up halfway through what may feel more like a painstaking ordeal than an exercise in democracy.
Another complication is that voting will occur in an utterly unpredictable new arena, California's first "blanket" primary, in which the names of all candidates for each office will appear on the same ballot. Voters will be allowed to select from all the choices without regard to party. Candidates are bracing for some mischief-making among voters who may bolt their party in an effort to elect an opposition candidate whom they perceive as a weaker contender in the general election.
Yet theories about the blanket primary have been dwarfed by the battle royal for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination among three contenders who were not particularly well known by California voters when the campaign began. As recently as a month ago, polls showed that Mr. Checchi (pronounced CHECK-ee) was the favorite, having built name recognition by saturating television markets since last November. Then Ms. Harman came along, channeling an estimated $15 million from her husband's smaller yet substantial stereo manufacturing fortune into the race, and overtook Mr. Checchi.
But in the closing days, Mr. Checchi and Ms. Harman, who represents the Los Angeles area, have stood on the sidelines as the solid but less flashy Mr. Davis, a 20-year veteran of state politics who had to scrounge for donations and could not even afford television advertising until six weeks ago, rocketed ahead. When he did buy advertising, Mr. Davis needled his rivals' spending with the tag line, "Experience Money Can't Buy." (The Davis campaign is spending about $9 million, which anywhere else would be considered a colossal amount.)
These spending sprees may drive the overall price for this primary, including statewide candidates and ballot issues, to more than $100 million. If Mr. Davis triumphs on Tuesday, as most analysts now predict, his candidacy may spur a national rethinking of the benefits of advertising blitzes -- and of campaigns that are financially driven by wealthy candidates. At a time when the economy is booming, it also may suggest and polls confirm, a waning in voters' appetites for outsiders from the business world with little Government experience.
Mr. Checchi's collapse in the polls may not be a case study in how money cannot buy voters anymore. In a sprawling state like California with immense media markets, a candidate cannot compete without millions of dollars. And by the standards of California politics, Mr. Checchi's commercials were relatively tame.
Instead, the lesson for Mr. Checchi -- who has spent well over half the sum Ross Perot lavished on his Presidential race in 1992 -- might be that money, in itself, cannot assure success if a campaign's strategy is fundamentally flawed. Analysts explained that voters, after initially being drawn to Mr. Checchi, objected to his decision to go negative at all because he had presented himself as an outsider who had no intention to engage in gutter-level politics.
Mr. Davis, who was heard confiding this weekend that "I am the most fortunate person on planet Earth," may also be the beneficiary of unintended consequences. Mr. Checchi took aim at Ms. Harman as she began to creep up in the polls. Surveys indicate that his advertising barrage damaged Ms. Harman severely but exacted an even greater toll on Mr. Checchi. Then Mr. Davis stepped in.
Governor Wilson, an adroit practitioner of slashing advertising who had weeks ago predicted Mr. Checchi would win, said in an interview that he had never seen such fluctuations in a primary.
"It's a reflection of the enormous amount of money that has been spent and the peculiar dynamics of this three-person race," he said. "Checchi has spent more money than anybody in history, and in a two-person race, probably his attack upon Harman would have been successful. The irony is, I'm convinced, that the people he drove away from Harman went to Davis because they had a place to go. And Davis, ironically, because he didn't have the money, was the beneficiary of his own silence."
In a noticeable departure for a campaign fought largely on the paid airwaves, the Democratic candidates for Governor took to the trail this weekend with last-ditch efforts to appeal to the undecided, and to those who are reluctant to come to the polls at all. Mr. Checchi, who can afford chartered jets and limousines, traveled in a shiny yellow school bus. And, stopping at a reception here Friday evening in a final burst of campaigning, Ms. Harman rejected the worrisome poll numbers for her. "With four more shopping days left," she said, "my own positive campaign is shining through."
The Checchi fallout may have spilled into the race between two Republicans who are vying to take on Senator Boxer: Matt Fong, the State Treasurer, and Darrell Issa, a car alarm entrepreneur. Some backers of Mr. Issa have complained that voters have become dismissive of his campaign because, at first glance, he fits the Checchi mold of being a business executive with no Government experience who is dipping into his own fortune to buy television advertisements.
Mr. Issa has spent about $10 million on the race, compared with about $1 million for Mr. Fong, but has been unable to gain much traction. While it has been obscured by the abrupt turns in the contest for Governor, the Senate contest offers the most suspense in these final days. The latest polls show that the outcome is too close to call.
Given the instability of the governor's race in particular, it might be imprudent for anyone to profess to knowing what will happen on Tuesday. Joseph Cerrell, a longtime Democratic strategist in Los Angeles, said he would not dare make any predictions.
"For a guy who's been doing this stuff for 40 years, this is the first time I stood there with a question mark over my head," Mr. Cerrell said, "which is almost embarrassing."

HEADLINE: For 12, a Hard Look at Death Penalty

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
An unemployed resident of Red Hook, Brooklyn, said that he believed the death penalty made criminals "think twice before committing heinous crimes," but that as a juror he would not automatically vote to execute every killer, because it "depends on how and why the murder was committed."
A medical technician from Bedford-Stuyvesant said that her first husband had been killed in a 1981 shooting, but that her decision on whether to impose capital punishment in a murder case "would depend on the evidence presented." 
 An administrative assistant from Bensonhurst with a doctorate in English literature, called her feelings about the death penalty "sobering," saying the "responsibility for someone's life is an awesome one."
The three Brooklyn residents are among the 12 jurors who are expected this week to begin determining whether a former jail guard, Darrel K. Harris, will be the first person sentenced to death under the law that reinstated capital punishment in New York State three years ago.
Their statements came from questionnaires they filled out and in replies to questions by the judge and prosecution and defense lawyers during jury selection for Mr. Harris's trial in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. He was charged with killing three people during a 1996 robbery at an illegal social club in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and on May 19 the jury convicted him of first-degree murder.
Now the seven women and five men on the panel must perform the second task that the 1995 capital punishment law sets out for them: sentencing the 40-year-old Mr. Harris to death by lethal injection or to life in prison without parole.
The life sentence is an option if the jurors find it warranted by so-called mitigating factors, which can include positive aspects of Mr. Harris's background and character, and his state of mind at the time he committed the killings.
A decade ago Mr. Harris was publicly honored as a hero for saving a fellow correction officer during an inmate riot at a Brooklyn jail. In the trial's penalty stage, which opened on Tuesday, his lawyers are offering this as one among several mitigating factors. Others include an argument that Mr. Harris is a seriously disturbed man whose murderous explosion was fueled by stresses stemming from his upbringing and his former work as a jail guard, combined with drug and alcohol abuse. His drug use ended his career with the city's Correction Department in 1991.
The mitigation testimony continues today before Acting Justice Anne G. Feldman, as arguments and testimony are also to begin in Poughkeepsie in the second death penalty trial under the 1995 law, that of Dalkeith V. McIntosh, charged with murdering his estranged wife and her daughter by a previous marriage. And jury selection began last week for the third death penalty trial, and the second in Brooklyn -- that of Jermaine Page, who prosecutors contend murdered a man execution style after robbing him.
At Mr. Harris's trial this week, after the defense finishes presenting witnesses -- who have included the jail guard Mr. Harris saved -- the jury will hear the prosecutors' arguments that any mitigating factors do not offset what they have termed cold-blooded killings committed to eliminate witnesses to Mr. Harris's robbery. He shot two victims -- Michael Harris (no relation) and Jerome Sims -- in the head and fatally stabbed Evelyn Davis after running out of bullets.
The jurors who will assess all this, whose identities the court has kept confidential, range in age from the 30's to the 60's and include five people in health related jobs, four in office or blue collar employment, a science teacher, a retired woman and the unemployed man who last worked as a truck driver. Five of the jurors have college degrees.
Racial influences on the jury that lawyers sometimes fear when the defendant and the victim are of different races, are not a factor in this case. Mr. Harris is black, as were all his victims. Eight of the jurors are black, three are white and one is Hispanic.
On their questionnaires, four of the jurors indicated a firm belief that some killings demand the death penalty, seven did not express vigorous feelings about capital punishment, one way or the other, and one, a medical technician from East Flatbush, simply said, "It is the law in New York State."
But all said that they would assess the circumstances of the killings, as well as Mr. Harris himself, and would consider both life in prison without parole and the death penalty.
For example, a 35-year-old office worker from East New York said on her questionnaire that she favored capital punishment "if a person willingly and knowingly plans to murder another person without any remorse whatsoever and for no reason." But she also said that she would want to know the "defendant's state of mind at the time of the murder, the reason for the murder and did the defendant think of the consequence."
Similarly, a 49-year-old laboratory assistant from Bedford-Stuyvesant, who wrote "open mind" when asked her current feelings about the death penalty, also said that in deciding a sentence she would want to know "the state of mind of the defendant at the time of the act."
The last execution in New York State was carried out in 1963, in an electric chair. In 1984 the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, declared the remaining provision of the state's previous death penalty law unconstitutional.

For a Day, Kingston Comes to Meadowlands

BYLINE: By STEVE POPPER 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., May 31

 BODY:
As the names of the Jamaican national team were announced during pre-game introductions, the beating of the steel drums, as well as the public-address announcer's words, were drowned out by the raucous cheering from the crowd.
The 38,624 fans, nearly every one of them adorned in the bright gold of their team, grew even louder as the country's national anthem was played. And when the team, affectionately called the Reggae Boyz, scored against the Caribbean All-Stars, the crowd continued to give them a fervent send-off as Jamaica prepares to play in the World Cup for the first time. Its first game is scheduled for June 14 against Croatia. 
 Forget that it was their Brazilian coach, Rene Simoes, who gave the team its nickname or that seven of the team's players were hastily imported from England; the first goal was scored by one of those hired guns, assisted by another. Or that perhaps the best of the British imports, Dwight Yorke, was playing for the Caribbean All-Stars and that he scored a pair of second-half goals to hand Jamaica a 2-1 loss in its final tuneup for the World Cup. The crowd cared only that Jamaica would be there in France, the first English-speaking Caribbean team to qualify.
"Every time we are in the pitch, they are fanatical," said Fitzroy Simpson, who was born in England. But with both of his parents from Jamaica, he was one of the first British players to join the team. He added: "We're carrying not just the hopes of Jamaica, but the whole Caribbean. It's a great responsibility. It's been the same wherever we go. The whole country is behind us. Jamaicans hold very dearly to their country."
Jamaica did not show anything that will worry its World Cup opponents, but did exactly what the fans wanted on this farewell exhibition. Theodore Whitmore deftly handled the ball, entertaining the crowd. Paul Hall, another of the early British players to join the team, fed Frank Sinclair in the 34th minute and Sinclair, who joined the squad after it qualified for the World Cup, slipped past a defender and drilled a shot into the lower-left side of the goal.
But after taking the 1-0 lead into the half, Simoes cleared his bench, not choosing to risk an injury with a squad of 22 players, the number that the more established programs will have to reach by Tuesday, with little depth to find a fill-in if he lost one of his players. For this team, and especially for this crowd, Jamaica was happy to put on a show and then ready itself for the real games.
Five hours before the game began, the parking lot was crowded with cars, Jamaican flags sprouting from the radio antennas. The mood of the fans never changed with the score. The Reggae Boyz have become a phenomenon akin to a pop group; perhaps with the British flavor, the Beatles would be a better comparison than Bob Marley.
"That's the supporters," Simpson said. "We've kept our feet on the floor. Like a balloon, we know it can pop at any time."
Warren Barrett, the team's goalkeeper and longtime captain, said: "There is a bond through which we have united a country. Our country has problems of social and economic nature, but when we play football, the rich, the poor, everyone gets together."

HEADLINE: BOXING;
A Heavy Regulatory Presence in New York

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: PORT CHESTER, N.Y.

 BODY:
Compared with small boxing events in other parts of the country, the fights held here in April at the Capitol Theater looked like a police officers' convention. Clumps of men in sport coats with badges and New York State Athletic Commission emblems guarded the dressing-room doors. Corner inspectors in surgical gloves leaned over the ropes to monitor the fighters and their trainers between rounds, and were rotated at the bell, with a new inspection team for each bout.
That level of regulatory presence would be unthinkable in many states. But whether it is zealous, invaluable attention to fighter safety or wasteful extravagance is a question central to the debate about what New York taxpayers get for their money in boxing regulation. 
 Over the years, the state athletic commission has been criticized as a political patronage operation. Some boxing experts have recently questioned the credentials of the commission's doctors.
Still, when compared with other states, New York clearly requires more medical screening of fighters and operates with a budget that dwarfs those elsewhere.
The commission's budget, which was seriously cut during the economic recession in New York in the early 1990's, has ballooned since, despite no growth in the number of events. In 1992, for example, the commission spent $494,800 to regulate 31 boxing shows. Last year it spent $841,000 to oversee 30. A spokesman for the commission, Scott Trent, said most of the spending increases were due to staff salaries being restored to their former levels. But spending on supplies, materials, medical testing, travel and equipment purchases grew as well, according to commission budget documents.
Most noticeably, the question of just how serious an operation the commission is was underscored with the appointment of Floyd Patterson as chairman in 1995. The two-time heavyweight world champion, who is 63, has memory problems. He resigned in March, but had long been regarded within the sport as a $76,000-a-year figurehead.
"He was warm, friendly and hospitable, but I knew very rapidly that he was not really running the show," said Stanley B. Levin, an attorney and promoter for Roy Jones Jr., a supermiddleweight who fought in New York in 1996.
New York places more demands on fighters and promoters than most states do, in both medical tests and fees. The state requires each fighter to get a CAT brain scan, as well as an electrocardiogram and an EKG once a year. It also collects a 5.5 percent tax on tickets and a .55 percent tax on television rights. And boxers generally have to be in the state for several days before their fights.
The commission has been dogged by suspicions of excessive patronage. The commission's legal counsel, Lawrence A. Mandelker, who gets paid $52.10 an hour, also represents the State Republican Party. But even promoters who have been critical of New York say that putting the state in a national context is crucial.
"There are some commissions that are putrid, terrible," said Mike Boorman, a spokesman for Main Events, a large boxing promoter based in Totowa, N.J. "If you did a bell curve, New York would get an A."

HEADLINE: The White House Dismissed Warnings on China Satellite Deal

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH and JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
The caution signs made it evident that the application by Loral Space & Communications to export a satellite to China earlier this year was anything but routine.
Justice Department prosecutors warned that allowing the deal could jeopardize possible prosecution of the company for an earlier unauthorized technology transfer to Beijing. The Pentagon reported that Loral had provided "potentially very significant help" to China's military rocket program. And senior White House aides cautioned that the deal was certain to spark opposition from critics of the Administration's nonproliferation and human rights policies toward China. 
 But the White House pressed ahead, concerned about the financial costs to Loral of delaying approval of the deal and certain that it could defend the decision against subsequent criticism.
Rarely is the public given a detailed look inside the White House decision-making process on a matter of national security as sensitive as the export of a satellite to China. These records ordinarily remain sealed for years, buried under the Government's strict regime of secrecy.
But documents produced by the White House 10 days ago in response to a demand from Congress provide an unusually rich account of the evolution of a Presidential decision in which numerous warning signals were raised and then dismissed.
According to the records, the February decision by President Clinton to approve the Loral satellite launching was treated as an urgent matter not because of its importance to the national security, but because the company was facing heavy fines for delay.
Concerns about European competition for the satellite business and fears that denying the deal would damage the United States-China relationship overrode words of caution from other Government agencies.
The presumption throughout was that the deal would be approved, as had 19 previous applications under Presidents Clinton and Bush. The documents reflect the White House staff's search for a defensible rationale for the decision.
Federal and Congressional investigators are now examining what led the President to risk political embarrassment by creating the perception that he might be letting Loral -- headed by the Democratic Party's largest campaign contributor -- off the hook in a serious criminal inquiry into whether Loral executives helped China's missile program.
 
Decision Traced To a Satellite Crash
Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, had a preemptive answer in the decision memorandum he forwarded to the President on Feb. 12. The memo briefly noted the Justice Department's concerns and referred to the possibility that Loral might have significantly aided China's military rocket program.
But he urged the President to approve the deal regardless.
"In any case," Mr. Berger wrote, "we believe that the advantages of this project outweigh this risk, and that we can effectively rebut criticism of the waiver."
Mr. Clinton approved it with his distinctive backward check mark six days later.
Since 1989, the export of American satellites for launching on Chinese rockets has been suspended as a result of sanctions imposed after the killings in Tiananmen Square. A deal can go forward only if the President concludes that the export is in the national interest and issues a waiver.
President Bush approved all nine waiver requests that reached his desk; President Clinton routinely followed the practice in his first four years in office, signing 10 waivers with little internal debate or external controversy.
But the waiver Mr. Clinton signed on Feb. 18 was not routine. The roots of his unusual decision trace back two years when a Chinese rocket carrying a Loral satellite crashed into a village seconds after liftoff, killing and injuring dozens of civilians.
A few months later, Loral led an outside review team to help the Chinese figure out what had happened. The company says its officials did nothing wrong. But Loral also acknowledged serious mistakes in a June 1996 disclosure to the State Department, including an admission that it allowed the Chinese to see its lengthy review of the rocket mishap without prior Federal approval. Such technological assistance to the Chinese requires prior Government approval, which Loral had not received.
At virtually the same time that Loral made its disclosure to the Government, the company was seeking another Presidential waiver for a satellite. Its chairman, Bernard L. Schwartz, donated $100,000 to the Democratic Party four weeks before the waiver application was approved in early July 1996 by Mr. Clinton.
It is not known whether Loral's help for the Chinese was mentioned in the memorandum that went to the President because the White House has not released documentation on that decision.
It is known that the State Department had already alleged in a letter to satellite industry executives that there had been a violation of American export control laws in the accident review.
But as of July 1996, no criminal inquiry was under way. The Justice Department began its investigation only after the Pentagon completed an assessment of the accident review in May 1997.
That is the same month Loral applied for its most recent waiver, for the Chinasat 8 satellite.
 
Company's Concerns Reach White House
The first notice to the White House of unusual problems with the Chinasat 8 waiver application came in an early January memorandum from the State Department detailing the factors for the President to consider.
Although couched in careful bureaucratic language, the State Department document made it clear that this was no routine export license application.
The State Department pointed out that China's transfer of missile technology to Iran might prohibit the export of the Loral satellite or any other satellites or related items.
"Moreover," the State Department memo stated, "information about unauthorized defense services provided by Space Systems/Loral and another U.S. firm to China's Long March 3B Launch Vehicle" could lead to imposition of harsh sanctions against the company.
But the State Department and other agencies nonetheless recommended granting the waiver, because the deal would enhance the United States' leadership in commercial telecommunications, provide an incentive for China to adhere to international nonproliferation rules and improve trade ties with Beijing.
After virtually no debate at the White House, the State Department memorandum was rewritten as a decision paper for the President.
The State Department's concern about technology transfers to Iran appeared nowhere in the decision document, but a new element is inserted in the first and in most subsequent drafts. The President must act quickly, the draft states; any delay will cost Loral money.
"Due to severe contractual penalties which Loral will incur if it cannot begin technical discussions with the Chinese by next week, we recommend that you take action on this issue by January 20," read the first draft of the Presidential memorandum, dated Jan. 13.
A day earlier, Loral officials had made known to the White House their frustration at the slow Government response to their waiver application, which was submitted in May 1997.
A Loral letter found in White House files stated that unless the approval is granted within a week, the launching, scheduled for November, would be delayed by several months, costing the company at least $6 million. Any such delay would give the Chinese grounds for canceling the project, which would cost Loral $20 million, the company warned.
"Our competitors in Europe," Loral officials complained, "do not suffer delays due to export licensing or legal complications."
The company's concerns clearly were heard at the White House.
A senior aide at the National Security Council, Maureen E. Tucker, repeatedly pressed for a rapid decision in forwarding early drafts of the Presidential decision paper to associates at the council.
She described the memorandum and accompanying documents as "a very quick turnaround package for which I am seeking your clearance by tomorrow," she wrote on Jan. 13.
By Jan. 20, one frustrated aide scrawled on a draft of the memo, "Needs to go to POTUS today!!" POTUS is the White House jargon for President of the United States.
But the waiver request was held up by questions from Mr. Berger, who asked his legal aides to research the status of the Justice Department investigation and determine whether it would bar approval of the waiver.
Tellingly, Mr. Berger asked Gary Samore, the National Security Council's top weapons proliferation expert, in a handwritten note if the approval can be granted in phases "to get over immediate crunch."
Mr. Berger did not ask whether Loral's cooperation with the Chinese after the 1996 accident would require denial of the export license. Instead, he wonders in the note to Mr. Samore where there is "anything we can hang our hat on to characterize Loral's 'offense.' "
Mr. Berger's aides sought advice from officials at the State Department, who informed them that Loral's offenses appear to be "criminal" and "knowing." Ms. Tucker was told that the Pentagon investigated Loral's assistance to the Chinese after the 1996 missile explosion and concluded that the company provided "potentially very significant help" to Beijing's ballistic missile program.
 
Behind Decision To Grant a Waiver
The White House counsel Charles F. C. Ruff told a Security Council lawyer that the Justice Department's investigation mattered less than maintaining close diplomatic and business relations with China.
"Issue is not underlined twice impact on DOJ litig(ation)," the Security Council deputy counsel Newell Highsmith wrote in notes of his conversation with Mr. Ruff, "but whether bilateral U.S.-China concerns and economic factors outweigh risk of political embarrassment."
A principal argument behind Mr. Clinton's decision was that it would be unfair to penalize Loral by denying it a license if it was under investigation but had not been charged with any crimes.
The export law allows the President to deny a license if the license seeker has been indicted or if there is "reasonable cause to believe" the license seeker "has violated" United States export control laws. The White House documents show that some White House and State Department officials believed the latter, but Administration officials say they relied on a 1993 State Department memo which said that companies will be denied licenses only after indictment.
"In an ideal world we would wait until this matter is resolved," Malcolm R. Lee, a National Security Council aide, told other White House officials in an electronic message a month before the President's decision, referring to the pending Justice Department inquiry. But, Mr. Lee added, "that is impracticable."
A senior Administration official, speaking not for attribution, said that waiting for the results of the Justice Department investigation could delay the satellite launching for months, if not years.
And, the official added, "There were some imperatives to get a timely decision because of the penalties facing the company."
But the company acknowledges that no such penalties have been imposed and the launching is still scheduled for November, as it has been for the last year.
"We believe we will not incur penalties because we can work around the problem," a Loral official said late last week.
 
Pentagon Troubled By Loral's Role
The President did not receive a detailed assessment of the potential damage to American security caused by Loral's help to China in determining the cause of the 1996 launching failure. The Pentagon was troubled by Loral's technological assistance because the rocket science involved in putting a satellite into orbit is similar to that needed to deliver a nuclear warhead.
The Pentagon, relying on Air Force missile and intelligence experts, did not find grave damage but did conclude that the United States national security had been harmed, according to Administration officials.
A White House official said that the National Security Council never received the Pentagon report, which was prepared to assist the State Department. "We did the best we could in the memo for the President in describing what we understood to be the allegations," the official said. "We didn't beat around the bush."
White House aides overcame the major impediment to the waiver -- the concern of Justice Department prosecutors that it would jeopardize any possible prosecution -- by relying on the fact that "the Department had every opportunity to weigh in against the waiver at the highest levels and elected not to do so," as Mr. Ruff, the White House counsel, wrote on Feb. 13.
But Justice Department officials say that Mr. Ruff, in his discussion with Robert Litt, the top aide to the Deputy Attorney General, asked only about the impact of the waiver on possible prosecution -- not whether the department opposed the waiver.
It is not known how the Justice Department would have answered that question.

HEADLINE: BOXING IN THE SHADOWS: A special report.;
Out of View, the Fight Game Is Thriving

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE

 BODY:
In a tiny back room at the Mix Factory nightclub, rock music pounded through the cinder block walls as a dozen boxers on the Tuesday night fight card lined up for physicals. Jerry Strickland slouched. This ritual was old hat for him: The doctor prodded his stomach, felt his facial bones, checked his heart and his blood pressure, and asked how he felt. "Fine," Strickland said.
"You're all set," the doctor pronounced, completing the 90-second examination. 
 Thirty minutes later, Strickland, 45, was doing what he has done repeatedly since his first fight in 1968: getting beat up. He has been knocked out at least 46 times, more times than some boxers fight in a career. On this night, he was sent sprawling to the canvas three times -- blows that left him down on all fours trying to clear his head -- before the referee stopped the fight. For this he was paid $300.
"It's a job," Strickland said, sipping a beer at the bar as the fight crowd of perhaps 100 people filed out. "Right now you can get killed out in the street for free. I prefer if you hit me, I make some money."
Boxing, a sport as old as human aggression, is growing again after years of stagnation or decline, but the numbers are not coming from the glamorous multimillion-dollar title fights on pay-per-view television in storied locales like Las Vegas, Atlantic City and New York. Boxing is instead growing in places where there has been little of it in the past, like Indian reservations, and anonymous bars and clubs where it barely gets noticed. And much of the growth is in states where safety regulations are weak or nonexistent.
The growth is driven by confluent forces -- from a booming economy that allows upstart promoters to take new risks, to the decline of televised boxing, which is forcing managers and fighters to compile records and recognition in other ways.
The results are diverse, too.
For fans in Pennsylvania, Indiana and Wisconsin, it means the most local boxing shows in a generation. For small promoters, it means opportunities -- local exposure for fighters, and relationships with bigger players like Don King, who is subsidizing many of the shows as a silent partner. For state regulators, it means a greater struggle than ever to oversee a sport that is almost nobody's highest priority. For boxers like Strickland -- part of a fighting family that travels to places like Nashville for $100-a-round bouts -- it means more paydays.
And so there is a new generation of boxing capitals, including the low-budget basement version here. Tennessee, which was not previously a boxing mecca and which has an athletic commission staff of one man and his secretary, had 64 boxing events last year -- more than Nevada or New Jersey and second only to California's 92. In Indiana, where a volunteer athletic commission oversees the sport, the number of boxing events is expected to double this year to 30, equal to New York's. Idaho, which had almost no boxing a decade ago, had 10 shows last year.
The level of attention and money that states commit to the sport's safety differs greatly. New York, which has some of the most exacting medical requirements in the nation, spent nearly $1 million to regulate 30 boxing shows last year, while Tennessee spent $56,008 to monitor more than twice as many events, not bothering even to do blood testing on fighters. Six states have no boxing regulations at all.
All of which sits fine with Jerry Strickland and his half brother, Reggie, whose 242 professional bouts have made him a legend on the Midwest and Southern fight circuits. Tennessee has boxing like it used to be, Reggie Strickland said.
"Tennessee is the greatest state for boxing," he said. "It used to be Kentucky, but now they've got some snot-nosed commissioner. They're trying to be hard on the fighters. Here, they're just great all the way around. You never have a problem -- they do what they're supposed to do, and fighters do what they're supposed to do."
 
Overseeing Safety
Different Budgets, Different Attitudes
Many state and Federal officials say the new trends make boxing, a sport that has always danced on the line of respectability and infamy, a disaster waiting to happen. In Congressional hearings last year that resulted in the first Federal law on fighter safety, witnesses told of boxers who were being knocked out one night and fighting the next, of fighters' boxing under false names, including those of dead men, and of promoters telling boxers to put rolls of coins in their pockets at weigh-ins so they could earn bigger paydays fighting heavier opponents.
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, the chief sponsor of the Federal law, said the worst abuses and injuries were probably hidden because many fighters and managers were reluctant to testify. His investigators have not uncovered any ring deaths attributable to weak laws or inexperienced regulators. But the Senator said the result of a thousand blows to the head is cumulative, something that will only be revealed over years.
The legislation passed last year requires boxers to obtain a national identification card that must be presented before any fight. A national committee of state attorneys general is also looking at ways to further improve safeguards.
"We're beginning to see more injuries, and we're going to see even more," Senator McCain said. "It's almost inevitable, because there's an environment being created where the boxer is less protected. The sport is proliferating in places that have not known a lot of boxing before. It's become absolutely more dangerous."
State regulators in Tennessee and other places where boxing has surged say they believe the sport is being safely monitored. And several states, including Kentucky and Oklahoma, have recently tightened boxing supervision, to the annoyance of boxers like the Stricklands.
What national legislators do not understand, many state regulators say, is that it all comes down to money. Tennessee's boxing administrator, Tommy Patrick, said the issue of more medical testing comes up at almost every meeting of the Boxing and Racing Commission, but nothing is done. Its budget has no fat, he said. The $56,008 spent last year, for example, included payment for the time that Patrick and his secretary devoted to boxing -- between other duties like automobile racing regulation -- plus per-diem payments for inspectors and doctors.
"You're talking about fighters fighting for a $300 purse here, so they're going to pay for an AIDS test or a CAT scan or all this?" Patrick asked. "Certainly the boxing commission can't pay for it. Anybody hates to take the position that money rules the health of somebody, but you know, facts are facts. Somebody's got to pay for this stuff."
And there are also simply different levels of tolerance for risk in different regions of the country, an issue that is visible in everything from motorcycle helmet laws to day-care licensing. Patrick said the question of whether a fighter like Jerry Strickland, for example, should still be boxing in middle age, after scores of defeats and knockouts, is not something a boxing regulator here can or even should answer.
There are no age laws in Tennessee for fighters, and if someone can pass the physical and "adequately defend themselves," Patrick said, and the fight is not an obvious mismatch of skills, "there's really nothing in our law to stop anyone."
For big-budget fights of the sort held at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas or Madison Square Garden in New York, state officials can afford more rigorous medical testing and supervision, in part because the costs can be charged back to the promoters or added to ticket prices. But at the lowest levels of the sport, there is no such cushion.
"Our job has gotten a lot tougher," said Cletus Hansen, an official in the Wisconsin Department of Regulation and Licensing, which administers boxing regulation as well as licensing for cemeteries and real estate agents. Hansen said that because of the tougher standards from the new Federal law, which requires more extensive background checks, his staff gets bogged down just doing paperwork.
Perhaps as a result, fighters say that many of the old abuses -- fake names, fake identification cards, fighters back in the ring days after being knocked out -- are still going on. And some states do not always inquire too closely -- Tennessee, for one.
*One boxer who has fought three fights in Tennessee over the last six months said at least one was against an opponent fighting under another man's name and record.
*Another boxer fought in Nashville recently in violation of state laws that require mandatory days off. He had fought a 10-round fight only five days earlier, something officials failed to determine.
*Boxers at the Mix Factory show wrapped their hands before fights without any inspection by opponents or state officials, as is customary in higher-profile settings. Many fighters and managers say a hardened object concealed in a wrap can kill an opponent.
At the Mix Factory, where a ringside seat typically costs about $15, promoters say more regulation would eliminate jobs and opportunities for fighters.
Jim Westmoreland, the club's matchmaker, said regulations like New York's or Nevada's or New Jersey's would bankrupt a show like theirs in a day. "The medical costs alone would be more than our whole budget," he said.
But as it is, there is plenty of demand for journeyman fighters like the Strickland brothers, Reggie and Jerry. The two talk about boxing the way many people talk about their work, with a certain wry detachment. Reggie, 29, has the record of an old man: 242 professional fights, for a record of 44 victories -- including 5 knockouts -- 183 losses, 12 draws and 3 bouts in which no decision was rendered. Jerry says he has fought 300 professional fights, though his record according to Fight Fax, a company that tracks boxers, shows only 118, including 104 recorded losses.
And these days, the five-hour drive to Tennessee from their home in Anderson, Ind., has become like a commute to the office. Of Reggie's 37 fights since last fall, 20 have been here.
The Stricklands are both slight men, well under 6 feet and each typically weighing in at between 150 and 160 pounds. They share an edgy, often mordant humor. They do not worry about what they have done to themselves and their bodies, they say.
"I deal with reality," Reggie said. "And reality says if it's meant to happen, it's going to happen. So I live life to the fullest. Who can tell what tomorrow may bring, so I get what I can get today and worry about tomorrow tomorrow."
But for a journeyman fighter, tomorrow usually means another long drive to unmemorable places like the Chattanooga High School gym or to the gloomy third-floor lounge at the Mix Factory, where waiting boxers sprawl in booths by the bar. Fighters shadowbox by the pool tables, eyeing each other's moves.
There are apartments east of Nashville that Jimmy Adams, the Mix Factory's promoter, keeps for use by his stable of fighters, but the Stricklands prefer to arrive just before their fights, and head for Indiana by early morning.
Their story echoes some old boxing traditions in the Midwest and South. One boxer from Memphis, Sam Black, now apparently retired, fought more than 200 times professionally. Another boxer who regularly fights in Nashville, Danny Lee Wofford, has nearly 100 fights. For the Stricklands, family was the link and the reason. Another brother, Robert, also fights professionally, as does Jerry's son, Jerry Jr.
"I had an uncle who did a whole lot of time in Alcatraz," Jerry said. "When he came out, he said I was too quiet, that I needed to fight. Then he up and hit me right in the mouth. Made me bleed. I've been here ever since."
Reggie grew up watching Jerry. "One day I went to the gym with him and got beat up and liked it," he said with a laugh. "I've been doing it ever since."
The Stricklands say they have seen some of boxing's worst: fixed fights, decisions changed by the judges after a fight because of pressure from promoters. But they also, on some level, still believe.
Reggie feels he is owed at least a shot at one of the exploding number of championship titles, however marginally meaningful. "I figure after you've had so many fights, then you retire, there should be something there for you," he said. "I figure they should all just give me one chance for one good payday -- five, six grand. I ain't asking for much."
 
The Minor Leagues
'It's Just Basic Fighting'
Boxing has always offered a mix of maudlin emotion and coarse brutality. Tales of tough-kid up-and-comers, like the title character in the "Rocky" movies, are part of a whole misty-eyed subculture. And small-club boxing is where fighters have begun careers and built records for generations.
In places like the Mix Factory, all of boxing's primal emotions swirl: hope and ambition, nostalgia and greed. Some fighters here perceive a kind of purity, a place removed from the taint of big money and greedy promoters.
"It's like a church," said Ryan Wissow, a reed-thin 23-year-old novice boxer from Florida who has fought three of his five professional bouts in Nashville. Wissow pays his way here from his home in Fort Lauderdale, where he makes and sells customized golf clubs in his apartment. "It's no nonsense, right down to business, no frills. The vibe is wonderful. It's just basic fighting."
Patrick, the administrator of the Tennessee Boxing and Racing Commission, believes that what is happening in Tennessee, where boxing events have nearly tripled in the last two years, is not unlike the growth of grass-roots baseball leagues, an alternative for those disgusted with big-money sports and arrogant athletes.
"What we've got here are the minor leagues," he said, "a bunch of young boxers who are interested in building a record."
Others see only the sport's underbelly, a calculated churn of cheap paydays and occasional star turns by promising fighters looking to beat up the local talent on their way to title shots elsewhere.
They say that as the number of boxing organizations offering world title fights has grown -- there were 201 last year, compared with 35 or fewer in decades past -- the number of fighters who want to compete for titles and major prize money has climbed as well. That has created a demand among promoters and managers for matches that will build a fighter's record.
Others forces, by deliberate coordination or coincidence, are pushing more fights to the sport's lower rungs.
Big promoters like Don King have sharply expanded the number of fighters they send to once out-of-the-way places like Nashville. That has made the economics of running small shows more manageable, local promoters say, because the King organization picks up the costs and the pay for the fighters it sends.
The decline of boxing on television, which is at about its lowest level since the 1960's, is also pushing the growth of small-town events. Because the competition for television time is greater, boxers must build better records with more fights in order to get their fights broadcast. USA Network, which had a regular weekly boxing program, recently announced that it would cancel the show this summer, though Fox Network has mentioned adding a weekly boxing show that might replace it.
The result, promoters and managers say, is that smaller shows are easier to do financially now. In the 1970's and 1980's, when television time was ample, no one cared about the little clubs, said Nelson Fernandez, a New Jersey-based fight manager who regularly works with the King organization in sending boxers to places like Nashville. Now they have to, and money is flowing down from the top.
David Reyes, a boxing promoter who started his own small company 18 months ago in San Diego -- monthly boxing shows, $100 a round -- said local economics is the key, not the machinations of the television networks or big-time promoters.
"There are just more fighters now willing to fight for this kind of money," he said.
At the same time, boxing experts say, the sport is being decentralized geographically.
Five years ago, for example, a mid-size Philadelphia-based boxing promoter called Banner Promotions did about 20 boxing shows a year, with roughly 80 percent in Las Vegas or Atlantic City. This year, the company will do 30 shows, said Arthur R. Pelullo, the president, with two in Las Vegas, none in Atlantic City, and all the rest elsewhere in the country.
In 1988, more than 21 percent of the 682 boxing events held in the United States were concentrated in Nevada, New Jersey and New York, according to figures from Fight Fax and the National Association of Boxing Commissions. Last year, that total fell to 12 percent of 821 events.
"Atlantic City hotels are packed, so they don't need boxing, and Vegas is overhauling its image," said Bruce Trampler, a matchmaker for Top Rank, a Las Vegas-based promoter. And he said newer boxing sites, like the Indian casinos sprouting up across the country, are competing hard, paying big fees to get events.
In some parts of the country, there is also a vibrant ethnic flavor to the new boxing scene. In California, a half-dozen tiny promoters have popped up in recent years, doing small shows in Hispanic clubs and community centers in the southern part of the state, said Rob Lynch, the acting administrator of the state Athletic Commission. And in border cities in Texas, Mexican fighters are coming north, looking for a breakthrough, or at least a paycheck.
"All of a sudden, being more shows, it's helping the little guy a lot," said Eddie Garcia, a San Antonio-based manager and promoter who has worked with King and who is involved in the Hispanic boxing scene in Texas. One of Garcia's fighters, a 135-pound lightweight named Francisco Alberto Martinez, who was on the Mexican Olympic team, is using the club circuit as a way to try to become a contender in the United States. Martinez is hoping to compete this summer in a 15-city all-Texas tournament, a first for the state.
"It's an opportunity to try out for the major leagues," Garcia said.
In Nashville, Adams said he planned to stage his own title fights this summer. He is forming a new boxing organization, called the Global Boxing Association. It will have 17 weight classifications, he said, allowing for a different title fight, or maybe two, every week.
"Right now, I'm having my belts made," he said.

Clinton Backs More Money For Russian Debt if Needed
The United States would support new international financial aid to the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin if Russia could not meet its short-term debts, President Clinton said, because a meltdown of the ruble could threaten the stability the Government there. Mr. Clinton's statement appeared to pave the way for a new financial bailout of Russia by the International Monetary Fund. A1
 
The Prime Minister of Russia said in an interview that the country did not need emergency international loans to pull itself out of its financial crisis. But the interview with the Prime Minister was taped before the statement by Mr. Clinton, whose his support had been sought by the Russian Government. A8
 
Report Details Fate of Nazi Gold
Much of the gold looted by the Nazis was routed through Switzerland to pay other neutral nations for vital supplies that sustained Hitler's army in the last years of World War II, United States Government historians have concluded in a report. The report also doubles the American estimate of how much gold was in a Nazi account that received gold stolen from Holocaust victims. A1
 
India Appeals for Arms Limits
India called for early negotiations on a new global treaty limiting nuclear arsenals that would include India, Pakistan and possibly even Israel. India has made similar proposals before, but they were rejected by the five established nuclear powers: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. A1
 
Pakistan's nuclear scientists were hailed as national heroes as they returned from the remote desert where they had set off atomic explosions. Ninety-seven percent of Pakistanis support the testing, according to a poll by the Pakistan Institute for Public Opinion conducted for Gallup International in major cities. A6
 
Pakistan's nuclear tests required a global network of theft and espionage and the investment of millions of dollars. But the tests could not have happened without smuggled Chinese technology and contradictory shifts in American policy, say current and former United States officials. A6
 
Afghan Quake Kills Over 3,000
At least 3,000 people died after an earthquake shook northeastern Afghanistan, and many more bodies were feared hidden under rubble, aid agencies said. Officials said the quake, 6.9 on the Richter scale, affected 60,000 people in an area where more than 4,500 were killed by a quake three months ago. A7
 
Briefing on Iraqi Arms Planned
The chief United Nations arms inspector for Iraq plans to go to the Security Council this week with an unusually detailed technological accounting of what information Baghdad has failed to provide on biological, chemical and missile programs. The briefing is intended to counter Iraq's assertions that it has met all disarmament demands. A9

California voters will pick nominees for governor on Tuesday in an election that has rekindled a debate over the potency of television commercials and underscored the perils for wealthy candidates who finance their own campaigns. A1
 
Gray Davis, the Lieutenant Governor of California, holds a big lead in all polls to be the Democratic nominee for the state's highest office. A12
 
Clinton's Missile Decision
The February decision by President Clinton to approve the Loral satellite launching by China was treated as an urgent matter not because of its importance to the national security but because the company was facing heavy fines for delay, according to White House documents. Concerns about European competition for the satellite business, and fears that denying the deal would damage the United States-China relationship, overrode words of caution from other Government agencies.

Einstein Letters Hint Spy Link
Letters written in 1945 and 1946 by Albert Einstein to Margarita Konenkova are to be sold at auction in New York. According to a book by a former Soviet spy master, Konenkova was a Russian agent whose mission was to introduce Einstein to the Soviet Vice Consul in New York. A10

HEADLINE: Why Care? While Scientists Grope for Practical Answers . .

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN; Andrew C. Revkin reports on environmental issues for the metropolitan staff of The Times.

 BODY:
TEN years ago, two botanists from the New York Botanical Garden eagerly hiked up a hill in Haiti to examine what would prove to be one of only seven known remaining specimens of Attalea crassispatha, a very rare palm tree. To the scientists, the palm, with its unusual flowers and soaring trunk, was a special, splendid thing. But to the farmer about to cut it down, it was blocking his plans to expand his sparse field of stunted corn stalks.
A polite discussion ensued, recalled Dr. Michael Balick, one of the botanists. With a Haitian colleague translating, he tried his best to persuade the farmer to change his mind. "I talked about his children and grandchildren, about the global value of maintaining biological diversity," Dr. Balick explained. "He said, 'But what value is it to me today?' " 
 Dr. Balick said the hilltop debate in the shadow of the palm was a turning point, marking when he began to realize that efforts to preserve the diversity of life cannot rely on abstract arguments, but must be grounded in reality. Since then, he said, he has tailored arguments for preservation to fit the audience. In the case of the Haitian palm tree, only a cash payment for seeds, from the local forester, changed the farmer's plans.
The farmer agreed to keep the tree and started harvesting its nuts. "He was convinced to begin to preserve it, not only as a source of nuts, but also for income derived through the sale of the seeds so the tree could be grown elsewhere," Dr. Balick said.
Dr. Balick, like most biologists these days, is quick to unreel stories like this as he advocates actions to protect endangered species around the world. In every field of study, parables have emerged to justify preservation. Scientists talk of Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, found in yew tree bark during a random search of chemicals extracted from plants of the Pacific Northwest. They point to parasitic wasps, the size of pepper flecks, that are now used instead of insecticides to kill a host of crop pests, preventing more than $1 billion a year in agricultural losses. And they mention powerful antibiotics derived from the skin of African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud.
Some biologists focus not so much on the direct payoff from maintaining a lode of species, but on the indirect benefits, like the pollution-filtering properties of marshes or the ability of a healthy forest to prevent erosion on steep slopes. A scientific advocate exists for almost every living thing, even those that most people loathe. For example, Dr. Terry Erwin, an entomologist at the Smithsonian Institution, is perhaps the world's staunchest booster of beetles. Dr. Erwin has spent two decades studying the dizzying arrays of beetles that often inhabit trees in the tropics. His record is about 1,700 species found in one tree in Peru -- just beetles, just one tree.
"In our everyday experience, insects are usually problems -- mosquitoes, roaches, that kind of thing," Dr. Erwin said. "But, really, 98 percent of all insect species provide ecological services that keep the environment going." An important service is taking out the garbage, with fly maggots and dung beetles recycling rotting meat or feces into useful fertilizers. And without the thousands of bees, beetles and other insects that pollinate flowering plants, Dr. Erwin said, "we'd all be eating grass."
Other scientists say the downside of tampering with an ecosystem is as critical as the benefits of preserving it. As species are removed or a habitat becomes fragmented, the structure of a richly interlaced community of plants and animals is more likely to collapse. And when humans invade and transform landscapes, biologists say, it seems that these degraded areas are more likely to unleash harmful pests or diseases.
Some scientists, when pushed, fall back on the esthetic values that lie in untrammeled nature and the moral imperative of treading lightly on the earth. One such voice is that of Dr. Michael W. Klemens, a biologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society who has studied the imperiled reptiles and amphibians of both Tanzania and the New York suburbs. "A balance and richness of species adds to the richness and fabric of our own lives," Dr. Klemens said. In conversations with people he has encountered on both continents, he has found that "if given a choice, people in Africa and New York say they would like to have wildlife remain a part of their existence."
Finally, many scientists point to the enormity of the unknowns, emphasizing that we are destroying thousands of square miles of rain forest or wetlands before we have even catalogued or named the resident species, let alone understood their relationships or possible value. But these are the arguments that are least useful on the ground in the tropics, where much of the destruction is taking place.
DR. BALICK said: "It's still very important to talk about its importance for the spirit and soul, for the environment. But some of our effort must be focused on making a case for direct economic benefits, to everyone from policy makers ranging right down to small farmers."
There are ways to make a case for preservation based on local economics, he said, but nothing is as simple as it seems. "Three and a half billion people on the planet use medicinal plants for some part of primary health care," he noted. "You'd think if your health depends on something, you'd want to preserve it."
The problem, he said, is that in most places medicinal plants are still harvested in the wilderness, not grown on farms or on plantations. "Wild-harvested plants are usually considered more powerful," he said. "And that puts great pressure on ecosystems."
Some countries are recognizing the potential value and potential threat, he said, pointing out that Belize created a medicinal plant preserve in 1993 and that India has set aside more than 100 such preserves. Perhaps the hardest challenge, biologists say, is to insure that a species preserved one year is not imperiled the next.
The rare Haitian palm tree, for instance, was left standing for a while. It was already fairly old and has probably died, said Dr. Andrew Henderson, the other botanist who traveled with Dr. Balick to Haiti. Altogether, 26 specimens were located on Haiti, but the trees, which are isolated and therefore not pollinated, has left the species essentially extinct. "In reality, it's a goner," Dr. Henderson said.

HEADLINE: The 'Other' Drug Problem: Forgetting to Take Them

BYLINE: By ABIGAIL ZUGER 

 BODY:
PEDRO Lopez left his Bronx home in a big hurry one morning several months ago and became a medical statistic by nightfall.
Nothing happened to him; he felt fine. But the vials of prescription medications on the edge of his bathroom sink went unopened that morning, and again that afternoon, and then most of the rest of the week. By the end of the month he had stopped taking them at all. 
 With other things on his mind, Mr. Lopez, 41 and disabled, had joined the millions of Americans who fail to take their medications as prescribed -- and who are suddenly attracting a flood of attention in the health-care world.
Study after study over the last 20 years has shown that misuse of prescription drugs is a worldwide epidemic every bit as dangerous and costly as an actual medical illness. It was tagged "America's other drug problem" in the early 1990's when researchers consistently found it responsible for 10 to 25 percent of hospital and nursing home admissions studied. In 1984, the National Pharmaceutical Council, an association of pharmaceutical companies, estimated that misuse of prescription drugs had caused 125,000 deaths a year from heart disease alone. In 1993 the same organization calculated that not taking medicines correctly was draining upwards of $100 billion a year from the nation's economy in direct and indirect costs.
And with increased cost consciousness has come a new appreciation of the problem of "noncompliance," as medicine has labeled the phenomenon of skipping some doses, doubling up on others, forgetting to refill at the end of the month or taking a few of a family member's antibiotics on the chance they will work better than the ones prescribed.
Interest has been sharpened by new studies clearly demonstrating that disorders like elevated blood cholesterol or asthma respond far better when patients take medications as prescribed. And the flip side of the equation has been vividly illustrated by the medications for tuberculosis and AIDS: they may actually damage a patient's health when taken improperly, by inducing drug-resistant disease that may be passed on to others and cannot be treated at all.
In fact, improving medication-taking behavior may be one of the few arenas in health care today where widely disparate interest groups -- including medical researchers, patient advocates, drug companies, public health authorities and H.M.O. executives -- share a goal. The result: an outpouring of medical articles and studies on the subject and a cornucopia of new tactics, devices and programs all aiming to cajole patients like Pedro Lopez to remember their pills.
Ten years ago, his lapse might have netted him nothing more than a lecture from his frustrated doctor and a sheaf of new prescriptions. Instead, only days after he confessed at the doctor's office, Mr. Lopez found himself the center of a flurry of activity directed at getting him back on track.
He had a set of new medications with fewer side effects, a simplified schedule for taking them, a stack of informational brochures about them, a weekly appointment with a health educator, a little oval-like tag for his key chain that beeped at pill-taking time and an account with a mail-order pharmacy that delivers his refills automatically at the end of each month. Several weeks later Mr. Lopez said he was taking his medication more regularly.
"People in general take about 75 percent of their medications as prescribed," said Joyce Cramer, a medical researcher at Yale University and an authority on drug-taking behavior. But within that figure the range of misbehavior is wide. Nancy Houston Miller, a nurse who is the associate director of Stanford University's Cardiac Rehabilitation Program in Palo Alto, estimated that 10 to 20 percent of patients grossly flout medication regimens -- never filling the prescriptions or taking only a few token pills. About 50 percent take doses more or less correctly. And an all-important 30 to 40 percent in the middle are "partial compliers," forgetful enough that the medication may have only a fraction of its desired effect or may actually be harming them, but well-intentioned and able to be trained to do better.
The interplay of medications and diseases and human behavior further complicates the picture. Some drugs are more "forgiving" than others, said Dr. John Urquhart, a physician and professor of pharmacoepidemiology at Maastricht University in Maastricht, the Netherlands, who is one of the world's experts in medication-taking behavior. The blood-pressure drug reserpine, for instance, continues to lower pressure for a full two weeks after a dose, forgiving many pill-taking lapses. Shorter-acting medications demand better compliance to work.
Patients with serious diseases who are veterans at taking medication -- cardiac-transplant patients, for instance -- are usually better pill takers than those with silent conditions like high blood pressure, Dr. Urquhart said. But in general, predicting what patient will display which pill-taking behavior often yields surprises.
Income, education, sophistication and competence in other parts of life correlate only very poorly with pill-taking behavior, the experts agree. People who know the purpose of the medication and the way it is supposed to work often do better than others. But education has its definite limits in inducing good pill-taking behavior -- doctors, for example, are notoriously poor at it. In one large study of heart-attack prevention in male doctors in the 1980's, a full 30 percent of doctors were disqualified because they proved unable to take a single pill reliably every day.
Thus, as valuable as educational brochures, package inserts and videotapes may be, they are often now supplemented with a range of new compliance tools.
Some tools are million-dollar, labor-intensive programs. At Stanford, for instance, Ms. Miller has shown that heart-attack patients assigned to a nurse who spends hours educating them about diet, smoking, exercise and drug treatment, and then makes follow-up phone calls at home, are far more likely to stay on their medications than those who receive standard medical care.
Similarly, in New York City, a program in which city health department workers actually hand tuberculosis patients their medications every morning and watch them swallow has been credited with substantially increasing cure rates for the disease in the last five years.
Other new gadgets encourage patients to supervise themselves. A famous prototype for these devices was the circular container developed in the 1960's to help women remember their daily oral contraceptive pill. Flat blister-packs of prescription medications are now widely used in Europe to serve the same purpose, Dr. Urquhart said.
At the AIDS clinic at Yale-New Haven Hospital, every patient is supplied with a large rectangular pillbox whose 28 compartments can hold a week's worth of medications to be taken several times a day, said Dr. Gerald Friedland, a professor of medicine at Yale who directs the AIDS program. Current treatment for AIDS requires patients to take up to two dozen pills daily, often with different requirements for each, like an empty or a full stomach. "What's special about H.I.V. infection is the sheer complexity of the medications," Dr. Friedland said. "One of the definite predictors of poor adherence to treatment is the complexity of the regimen."
Other gadgets now on the market include simple electronic alarms that can be programmed to sound at intervals throughout the day, like the ALR tag made by TDI, and more sophisticated beepers that flash messages ("Time to take a gemfibrozil now," one made by Medprompt might tell patients with heart disease) as well.
And the newest devices entering offices and clinics can actually provide patients with little monthly medication report-cards, for both patient and doctor to inspect and try to improve.
They are pill-bottle caps fitted with a battery and a computer chip that remembers every time the bottle cap is opened and closed. Once a month the chip's memory can be downloaded into a computer and turned into a graph of exactly when during the month the patient dipped into the vial.
Originally developed by Dr. Urquhart at the Aprex Corporation in California in the 1980's, the bottlecaps have until recently been used almost exclusively in research studies. But the product is now making significant inroads into regular medical care. More than 100,000 patients have been monitored with the Aprex device to date, said Janice Wohltmann, a vice president of the company.
Far more accurate than other monitoring devices like medication diaries or blood levels of drugs, the bottle caps can tell doctors if "the drug failed the patient, or the patient failed to take the drug," Ms. Cramer said. Patients are seldom aware of the extent of their missed medication doses, and, if aware, they are unlikely to share the dismal truth with the doctor. But the information is crucial if doctors are to figure out if a patient who does not respond to a medication needs a different one, or just some help in taking the original prescription.
The bottle cap data can also be used in a kind of behavior modification system to encourage patients to stay with the treatment, she said. Patients can see for themselves that when they take their pills properly, their blood cholesterol, or blood pressure, or blood sugar reflects the good work.
"It's the type of monitoring that should become very common," Ms. Cramer said. "It's a part of a diagnostic evaluation" -- an objective reflection of the patient's medical condition just like a blood test.
So far no issues of privacy have surfaced in marketing the caps, she said. Even schizophrenic patients, generally leery of surveillance devices on or near their person, have accepted the caps with equanimity, she said, and greatly improved their medication-taking abilities as a result.
Starting a medication is a little like enlisting in the army, Dr. Urquhart said. "You're recruited in an office with the flags and the uniforms and you hear all about the big picture. But then after you sign on you find yourself in boot camp" -- and everybody needs a little help learning how to march in step.

HEADLINE: Shuttle Pays a Final Call To the Celestial Dragonfly

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.

 BODY:
ASTRONAUTS report that one of the most striking visions in space is approaching the Russian Mir space station, which first appears as a distant point of light. Drawing closer, Mir -- with its cruciform configuration of modules and arrays of wing-like solar panels -- slowly begins to resemble a giant cosmic insect glowing bright against the blackness of space.
Now, visits to this celestial dragonfly by American space shuttle crews are about to end. After being a focus of American manned space activity for the last three years, stays on Mir are about to join Gemini capsules and Saturn rockets as historical artifacts of the nation's space program. 
 The shuttle Discovery is scheduled to dock with Mir this week and retrieve Andrew Thomas, an American astronaut who has spent four months conducting research on the Russian outpost. But unlike in a half-dozen previous missions, the shuttle will not be carrying a replacement astronaut.
NASA plans to launch the Discovery today at 6:10 P.M. with a six-member crew. During the next 10 days, the shuttle crew is to rendezvous and dock with Mir, transfer more than a ton of supplies to the station while retrieving a like amount of scientific experiments and equipment, and bring Dr. Thomas back home.
Dr. Thomas, a mechanical engineer, is the last of seven Americans to live and work on Mir during the past three years. The shuttle-Mir program, which began in 1994 with Russian astronauts' joining the crews on shuttle missions and a shuttle flying around the Russian station, was billed as the first phase of a program leading to building the planned international space station.
At the conclusion of Dr. Thomas's flight, NASA officials say, American astronauts will have spent a total of 31 months on Mir, including a continuous stretch of 27 months that began in March 1996. This total of 962 crew days in orbit is more than Americans have accumulated in 17 years of flying space shuttles on missions that typically last less than two weeks, NASA officials say.
Frank L. Culbertson Jr., an astronaut who directs the shuttle-Mir program for NASA, says the program provided not only experience in long-duration space flight and research, but also invaluable lessons on how to run a multinational space station. In addition to dealing with language and cultural differences, he said, the experience contributed to crucial design changes in the future space station and a better understanding of how to handle crises.
"It's hard to imagine beginning the international space station without what we've learned from shuttle-Mir," Mr. Culbertson said in an interview. "We learned that there was a lot we didn't know. We learned from the problems that occurred and we learned a lot from the Russians about how to run a space station."
"The goals were to get engineering and operational experience, and that's what we got," Mr. Culbertson said of the program, which he said cost about $370 million, not counting shuttle flights to and from Mir. The program was part of a $400 million, four-year agreement signed by NASA in 1994 to compensate Russia for seven shuttle-Mir docking missions for research and for financing a $100 million module for the proposed international station. In 1996, NASA extended the program by adding $73 million for two additional flights.
The international space station is to be a giant research outpost assembled in sections above Earth over a five-year period. The project, estimated to cost more than $40 billion, is sponsored by a partnership of 16 nations, including the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada and members of the European Space Agency. Construction of the station is tentatively set to begin this fall, more than a year behind schedule. The delay has mainly been caused by failure of the Russian Space Agency to get sufficient money to complete a critical module that is to be the third piece of the station.
Dr. Norman E. Thagard, a former astronaut who was the first American aboard Mir, said the cooperative program was worth doing, despite some rough spots. Dr. Thagard, a physician and engineer, was the only American to fly to Mir with his crewmates aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft instead of an American craft.
"It cost us very little to look over Russian shoulders and learn how to -- and not how to in some cases -- run a space station," said Dr. Thagard, who spent 115 days aboard Mir starting in March 1995. "You would think that some astute engineers could think things through and come up with everything you would need for a good space station," he said. "But there is no substitute for being there and doing it to learn how to do something right."
While officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and outside experts generally agree that the shuttle-Mir program was valuable for both nations, it has been a source of controversy from the beginning. Some critics saw it as mainly a foreign aid program, a way for the United States to subsidize a faltering Russian space program that has been short of cash since the breakup of the Soviet Union. The effort was designed, they say, to keep unemployed Russian engineers and scientists from exporting rocket and weapons technology to make a living.
The program came under increasing criticism last year after the aging Mir, designed for a five-year life but now in its 12th year of operation, suffered a series of problems and near-disasters that threatened the safety of the Russian and American astronauts aboard.
In February, a fire broke out in a Mir module when a solid-fuel oxygen generator burned out of control for almost 14 minutes. The crew, including the American astronaut Jerry Linenger, found that the fire extinguishers aboard could not put out the blaze, which blocked the route to the Soyuz escape capsule. The extinguishers did manage to cool the walls until the flame died out.
In June, while the crew was testing a new system for docking Progress supply ships to Mir, a cargo vessel crashed into Mir, damaging some solar power panels and cracking the hull of the station's Spektr science module. As air leaked out of the station, the crew, including an American, Michael Foale, prepared to escape in the Soyuz vessel but was able instead to seal off Spektr and restore pressure in the rest of the station.
In addition to these mishaps, Mir's control computers began breaking down, setting the station adrift several times, and cracked pipes leaked toxic coolant into the station.
Concerned about Mir's deteriorating condition and crew safety, members of Congress, including the House Science Committee, demanded that NASA certify Mir's safety before committing any more Americans to long-term visits.
In September 1997, NASA's inspector general, Roberta L. Gross, released a report requested by the committee on Mir safety. In the report and subsequent testimony, Ms. Gross listed numerous safety concerns and questioned whether the agency was getting objective analysis from the various groups it had asked to assess safety. In a series of letters to agency officials, Col. Blaine Hammond, a former shuttle pilot and the top safety official in the astronaut office, called the Mir-shuttle program "a disaster waiting to happen."
Several powerful members of Congress, including space program supporters like as Representative F. James Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican who heads the science committee, said the United States had learned enough from having five astronauts stay aboard Mir for periods of four months or longer and that the last two visits should be canceled. The critics told Daniel S. Goldin, the administrator of the space agency, that if he allowed any more Americans to stay aboard Mir, he would be held personally responsible if anything went wrong.
Three days before the shuttle Atlantis took off for Mir last Sept. 25, Mr. Goldin, saying that two safety committees concurred, approved a four-month stay aboard Mir for the astronaut David A. Wolf. Because of numerous repairs to Mir systems and the absence of any major accidents, the stays of Dr. Wolf and Dr. Thomas, who replaced him aboard the station, proved largely uneventful.
"The concerns were reasonably well grounded," said Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of George Washington University's Space Policy Institute. "It was no picnic up there and probably more dangerous than we would have liked."
Dr. Logsdon said the shuttle-Mir program produced valuable information and experience for NASA at a bargain price, but it was time to end it and start building the next space station. "There is both a sense of gratification and relief that we have gotten through it without any of the really bad things happening," he said.
The space agency says the shuttle-Mir experience resulted in a long list of enhancements and modifications of the international space station and its planned operations. For instance, managers refined procedures for running the station from control centers in the United States and Russia, where flight officers speak different languages. One result was a better system of notifying partners of emergencies, Mr. Culbertson said.
"When the fire on Mir occurred, it took 12 hours before we were notified of it," he said. But after the collision, Mr. Culbertson said, he was on the telephone with Russian controllers as the astronauts were sealing the hatches.
Other space station changes resulting from the shuttle-Mir program include these:
*Addition of more lights and sensors to help in rendezvous and docking with the station.
*Demonstration of a wireless communications system that will reduce the number of data cables needed throughout the station, saving millions of dollars.
*Changes in computer programs, equipment and procedures to allow simple, single-command shutdown of ventilation systems to prevent fire from spreading, and improved fire extinguishers.
*Enhanced emergency procedures, including quick disconnect cables, in case of depressurization.
*Rerouting of cooling lines and electrical cables to prevent moisture condensation, and adding a protective coating to coolant lines to prevent corrosion and leaks.
*Changes in how fluids are vented from the space station, based on studies in the vicinity of Mir of contamination from the purging of fluids and waste.
*Improved psychological support of crew members, including enhanced electronic mail and news, better video and audio conferences with family members, and routine delivery of CD-ROM's containing mission-related information and recreational material.
*Better countermeasures to minimize the physical effects of weightlessness, including using Russian methods of zeroing in on specific muscles, like those in the neck, for exercise.
*Modified scheduling to give astronauts more flexibility in completing daily tasks.
"NASA is expert at flying 10- to 14-day shuttle missions, but operating a space station is very different," said Jim Van Laak, deputy director of the shuttle-Mir program, "It wasn't until we began operating on Mir that we began to appreciate the subtleties of this. It was quite a learning experience."
Some experts, however, questioned how much the lessons of the shuttle-Mir program would apply to the new space station.
James E. Oberg, a Houston-based consultant on the Russian space program, said NASA might be overstating the benefits gained from the program. Mir and its systems are so different from the international space station that some of the things learned are irrelevant, he said.
"We learned some critical things, such as how to work with the Russians to jointly control a space station and the effects of long-term flight on people, but we didn't need Mir to teach us to address some safety issues more seriously," Mr. Oberg said. "Most of what was learned was obvious or could have been learned in simulations. To brag about how much we learned on Mir is to brag about how little we knew about space stations before we started building one.
With the end of the shuttle-Mir program, questions remain on the immediate fate of Mir.
Until recently, the Russians planned to keep Mir in orbit until December 1999, when the first elements of the international space station are to be operational and routinely occupied. But the United States has pushed for Russia to stop supporting Mir earlier, perhaps as early as the spring of 1999, to free up the limited supply of Progress supply ships and manned Soyuz capsules in support of the new station.
Last week, Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian space agency, said his nation's desperate cash shortage might force it to abandon Mir a year earlier than planned and bring the station down as early as this fall.
Using a series of rocket firings from attached Progress ships, Russian astronauts plan to gradually lower Mir's orbit to an altitude of 120 miles from 250 miles. Several weeks after the final crew leaves Mir, Russian ground controllers will guide Mir into Earth's atmosphere with a series of rocket firings.
Whatever the timetable, Mir is to end its life after a fiery descent into the atmosphere, where most of it is to burn up and heavier pieces of debris are to fall into the ocean, probably the South Pacific.

Diagram: "Mir's Fiery Future"
After 12 years in orbit, the Russian space station Mir is being readied for retirement. Here is one possible scenario for deorbiting the station.
 
Over several months, a series of Progress-M cargo ships will dock with Mir, bringing supplies. Each will then fire its rocket engine, slowly altering Mir's orbit.
 
Gradually the station's orbit will change from its original 250-mile circular orbit to an elliptical one, approaching within about 120 miles of Earth at its lowest point.
 
An upgraded Progress, with twice the fuel capacity of previous craft, will then dock with Mir. After this is accomplished, the crew will depart in a Soyuz capsule.
 
Several weeks later, the Progress, under ground-based remote control, will initiate a series of engine firings designed to bring Mir into Earth's atmosphere.
 
If all goes as planned, the 120-ton Mir will burn up in the atmosphere over the Pacific. Any pieces surviving re-entry should fall harmlessly into the ocean.

Chart: "A Russian Drama: 147 Months of Mir"
In its 12 years of orbiting Earth, Russia's space station Mir has been host
to scores of astronauts from more than a dozen countries. It has been the laboratory for more than 200 experiments in areas like building in space, plant-growing in microgravity and prolonged weightlessness on humans. And as it has aged beyond its intended lifespan, it has been the stage for
a dramatic series of breakdowns and repairs.
 
FEB. 20, 1986 -- The 20.4-ton Mir core module is launched. It has living quarters, a laboratory and two docking ports.
 
APRIL 1987 -- The first expansion module, the Kvant 1, arrives with astrophysics and life support equipment but is unable to dock until astronauts, on a space walk, find and remove a bag of garbage in the coupling mechanism.
 
DEC. 6, 1989 -- The Kvant 2 docks, equipped with biological research equipment, solar arrays and an airlock to allow space walks.
 
JUNE 10, 1990 -- The Kristall technological module arrives with biological and materials processing equipment, two solar arrays and a docking port for
space shuttles.
 
MARCH 16, 1995 -- Norman Thagard becomes the first American on Mir and is presented with bread and salt in a traditional Russian welcome.
 
MARCH 22, 1995 -- Valery Polyakov sets a record 439 consecutive days in space. With another 240 days logged, he also holds the record for total time in space.
 
JUNE 29, 1995 -- In the first of an expected nine such U.S.-Russian linkups, the shuttle Atlantis docks with Mir, forming the largest spacecraft ever in orbit, at 225 tons.
 
MARCH 25, 1996 -- The Atlantis delivers Shannon Lucid, the first American woman on the station. She stays for 188 days, setting an American endurance record and world record for women.
 
APRIL 26, 1996 -- The Priroda remote sensing module arrives, completing the Mir, which now weighs 125 tons. The Priroda includes spectrometers for measuring ozone and aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere.
 
FEB. 23, 1997 -- An oxygen-producing candle bursts into flames, sending smoke through the station and blocking the route to the Soyuz space capsule. The fire burns almost 14 minutes.
 
MARCH 1997 -- Both oxygen generators fail, forcing the crew to rely on candles like the one that exploded in February.
 
APRIL 1997 -- Coolant leaks, briefly raising temperatures above 86 degrees and causing the primary air-purification system to fail.
 
JUNE 25, 1997 -- The Russian supply ship Progress collides with the Spektr module during a practice docking, damaging its solar arrays, causing a loss of air pressure and knocking out half the power.
 
JULY 1997 -- The commander, Vasily Tsibliyev, complains of an irregular heartbeat.
 
JULY 17, 1997 -- A Russian astronaut accidentally unplugs the main computer for the station, sending Mir into a tailspin. The reaction from Vladimir Solovyov, the mission director: This is a kindergarten.
 
AUG. 7, 1997 -- The relief capsule docks with Mir.
 
JAN. 24, 1998 -- The shuttle Endeavour docks, carrying Andrew Thomas, the last of seven American astronauts to stay aboard Mir.(pg. F5)

HEADLINE: One False Note in a Musician's Life;
Billy Tipton Is Remembered With Love, Even by Those Who Were Deceived

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH 

 BODY:
On the morning of Jan. 21, 1989, Billy Tipton, 74, a gifted jazz musician who was a veteran of the tiny clubs and V.F.W. posts of small-town America, collapsed on the floor of a mobile home in Spokane, Wash. Tipton's son William summoned paramedics, and as they opened Tipton's pajamas to perform resuscitation, they made an extraordinary discovery. Tipton, who most people had assumed to be a man, who had had at least five wives and had adopted three sons, was in fact a woman.
"Did your father ever have a sex change?" the paramedics asked William, he later recalled. 
 The news that Tipton, a pianist and saxophonist, was a woman came as a shock to nearly everyone, including the women who had considered themselves his wives, as well as his sons and the musicians who had traveled with him.
And the story has intrigued writers and composers ever since. The figure of Billy Tipton has become an emblem for the current fascination with gender, manifest in films like "The Crying Game," the play "M. Butterfly," and in the burgeoning academic field of "queer theory," which is entirely devoted to the subject of sexual identity.
Tipton's life has inspired an opera, "Billy," with music by Timothy Brock and a libretto by Brian Willis; a play, "Stevie Wants to Play the Blues," by Eduardo Machado, and a jazz musical, "The Slow Drag," by Carson Kreitzer, which was performed Off Broadway in 1996. It was also featured in a theatrical revue, "The Opposite Sex Is Neither," by Kate Bornstein, a woman who used to be a man. In Seattle, a group of feminist jazz musicians founded the Billy Tipton Memorial Saxophone Quartet.
Now a biography, "Suits Me: The Double Life of Billy Tipton," has been written by the literary scholar Diane Middlebrook, a Stanford University professor best known for her biography of the poet Anne Sexton. That book was criticized in some circles for incorporating transcripts of tape recordings of Sexton's sessions with her psychiatrist.
Part of the fascination of Tipton's story is in the window it provides on the world of jazz in the 30's, 40's and 50's, when popular tastes in music had been honed by radio, and jazz could be found in almost every town in America. With a few exceptions, like Hazel Scott, jazz was a man's world. Whether simply as a matter of sexual choice or to get work in jazz, Tipton lived the life of a man.
She was an acute observer of male and female style, and such a successful mimic, that she seems to have been able to deceive even those with whom she had the most intimate contact. For Ms. Middlebrook, Tipton was a case study in the essentially fluid boundaries of human sexuality. The subject provided an opportunity to explore the question of how much of what is called male and female is the result of biology, and how much is the result of a performance, acted according to cultural norms.
"She was a great performer," Ms. Middlebrook said in a recent interview. "I don't think she thought she was born in the wrong body. That's a contemporary narrative. She's not a lesbian, because the women she was with didn't know she was female. She occupied an undefinable space. She was someone who worked creatively in the gap between biology and gender."
Throughout history, of course, women have assumed male disguises for economic and social reasons. During the Civil War, Ms. Middlebrook notes, an estimated 400 cross-dressing women posed as men and served in the Union Army. George Sand and Colette both wore men's clothes. James Barry, a doctor who lived from 1795 to 1863, and who is credited with performing the first successful Caesarean section, was assumed to be a man until her death, when her true identity was revealed.
"Billy Tipton literally became a poster boy for raising consciousness about the confusion of sex (biological) and gender (culturally meaningful physical and social attributes)," Ms. Middlebrook writes. "Billy's story lets us watch one woman's bold solutions to gaining a certain amount of recognition in what was largely a man's world."
Billy Tipton was born Dorothy Lucille Tipton in Oklahoma City and grew up in Kansas City, a center of jazz. Dorothy came from a prosperous family. Her father, George, was an aviator, and her mother, Reggie, to whom she was close, was beautiful and glamorous. Dorothy was musically talented and studied organ, piano and saxophone in school.
 
Getting Around An Unwritten Law
Ms. Middlebrook's interviews with members of Tipton's family revealed that the cross-dressing began when Dorothy tried to find a job as a jazz musician. Indeed, said Leslie Gourse, author of "Madame Jazz," a book about female jazz musicians, "There was an unwritten code in the jazz world, that women just didn't get hired."
To pass as a man, Dorothy bound her breasts with Ace bandages and wore a prosthetic device. Later, she would tell people that she wore the bandages because of a childhood accident in which her ribs were broken. Tipton, who had a tenor voice, eventually joined a group called the Banner Cavaliers, and obtained a Social Security card as a man.
Early in her career, in late 1938, she played with Wayne Benson, a bass player. "She looked like a young boy," Mr. Benson said in an interview. "She was acting like a boy. No one said anything, but as far as I was concerned, she was a woman. I was surprised by their surprise when she died and they found out."
Ms. Middlebrook's book is a glimpse into the mass culture of the period. One of Tipton's first girlfriends was Non Earl Harrell, 14 years her senior and a star of the marathon dance contests popular at the time.
By most accounts, women found Tipton gentle, affectionate and kind. And she in turn preferred women who were somewhat self-involved. "She chose people who don't pay attention to other people," said Ms. Middlebrook. "People who don't notice things. She was also able to create a feeling of intimacy without attracting notice."
In 1946, Tipton met a shy, pretty 18-year-old, Betty Cox, and they lived together as man and wife.
"He was a great performer," Ms. Cox said in a recent telephone interview. "He had a neat voice, and was very personable." They had a sexual relationship, Ms. Cox said. But still, she said, she didn't know Tipton was a woman. She came from a sheltered background where sex was never discussed.
"Women didn't go around undressed," said Ms. Cox. "You wore a robe. You didn't leave the lights on when you had sex."
At one point, she and Tipton tried to conceive a child, Ms. Cox said, but she believed she had suffered a miscarriage. Ms. Cox accompanied Tipton on the road, but she eventually tired of it, and after seven years together, the two broke up. "I wanted to go back home; that was the end of it," said Ms. Cox, who went on to marry and have five children.
In 1951, Tipton formed the Billy Tip Tipton Trio. As leader, she slicked back her hair and wore a white dinner jacket. The group's style was reminiscent of Benny Goodman's trio and quartet. It played hits including "Exactly Like You," "All of Me," "The Way You Look Tonight" and "It's Only a Paper Moon" and recorded two albums, "Sweet Georgia Brown" and "Billy Tipton Plays Hi-Fi on Piano."
"I had no idea he was a woman," said Kenny Richards, who played bass and sang with the trio. "I didn't know until he died."
In 1958 Tipton had a chance to break into the big time when the group was offered a recording contract and a gig opening for Liberace in Reno, Nev., at more than double its usual fee. But Tipton said no. One reason he turned down the chance, Ms. Middlebrook theorizes, is that bigger exposure might have revealed who Tipton truly was.
Tipton settled in Spokane, continuing to play jazz, and working as a booker in a theatrical agency. There he met Kitty Kelly, a stripper known as "the Irish Venus." In a letter to Ms. Kelly, Tipton called her "a wonderful person, decent and honest." In another, she wrote: "I love you with everything that is in me, and I only hope that I can make you happy for the rest of my life."
 
'We Liked Each Other'
Ms. Kelly and Tipton settled down together. Now married and known as Kitty Oakes, she said she never knew that Tipton was a woman. Ms. Oakes said she had an illness that prevented her from having a sexual relationship with Tipton.
"We didn't share a room," she said."I was taught to judge the person head on, as they were. Billy was funny, gentle as a human being. We liked the same kind of music. We liked each other."
And they both wanted children. They went on to adopt three boys, John, Scott and William. By all accounts, Tipton was an ideal father, a Scout master who loved to go on camping trips with his boys.
"He was the only father I ever knew," William said recently. "He was there for us. He didn't go out and get drunk and beat on us.
"We had a close relationship. We would go to movies. It was more like good buddies. We went out to dinner, or we just sat and talked. It never occurred to me he was a woman."
For many years, it was a happy family, Ms. Oakes said. Tipton once told her in a letter: "You are instilled so deep in my heart that you have become part of me. It would be difficult to imagine life without you. In our seven years together we have seen much hurt and much pain, both physical and mental, and we still cling to each other."
But as the boys reached adolescence, tensions began to emerge in the marriage. Ms. Oakes said she felt that Tipton was not tough enough on them. "Billy, for whatever reason, couldn't, or wouldn't, control them," she said. Finally, in 1981, the couple separated, and the boys went to live with their father.
By now, Tipton was suffering from arthritis, emphysema and ulcers. What Ms. Middlebrook calls his "lifelong trait of avoidance" had prevented him from going to a doctor. Death finally came from a perforated ulcer.
After he died, it was left to his family to unravel the mystery of his life. "I know he wanted to tell me," said Ms. Oakes. "But he couldn't say, 'I'm tired, I'm old,' " and tell her the truth.
"Billy did a great Houdini," Ms. Oakes said, then laughed. "Instead of treating this as a grand deception, don't you think it's funny?"
Ms. Middlebrook writes: "Billy demonstrated by her accomplishment that gender, unlike sex, is in large part a performance. She was the actor, he was the role."
Before her death, Tipton had discarded all her sex-concealing gear, Ms. Middlebrook writes. "Billy had prepared to emerge from behind his screen like the Wizard of Oz, to dissolve the magic into wisdom, revealing by her nakedness in death that 'the difference' between men and women is largely in the eye of the beholder."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Fruit of the Loom redesigns its sales pitches with a modern edge for -- no surprise -- 'fruitness.'

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
SINCE the days when Carmen Miranda wore fruit on her head, consumers have been urged to wear Fruit of the Loom apparel on their bodies. Now the brand is changing its advertising in an attempt to create a more contemporary image.
A lighthearted campaign being introduced this week by Warwick Baker O'Neill in New York, which focuses on newer, more colorful and fashionable types of clothing, declares that "Every body loves Fruit." The television, print and outdoor ads are the first the agency has produced since winning the account late last year, with billings estimated at $20 million to $25 million. 
 "This advertising is the public expression of efforts going on at Fruit of the Loom to modernize their offerings," said Kevin O'Neill, president and chief creative officer at Warwick Baker, who offered a preview of the campaign. "Its mission is to reawaken the affection and awareness consumers have for the brand and to expand the understanding of Fruit's products."
The campaign is indicative of large-scale attempts by venerable brands to update their sales pitches, particularly in crowded consumer-product categories like apparel. Fruit of the Loom Inc. has been laying off employees, closing plants and shifting production to cheaper sites overseas, in response to intensifying competition among makers of underwear and casual wear for men, women and children.
The Hanes brand sold by the Sara Lee Corporation has long battled Fruit of the Loom for supremacy in the market segment of lower-priced clothing sold by mass merchandisers. Hanes is widely considered to have successfully freshened its advertising with slick, upbeat campaigns by Long Haymes Carr in Winston-Salem, N.C., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, which carry the theme "Just wait till we get our Hanes on you."
At the same time, as the economy improves, many consumers who have bought Fruit of the Loom are tempted to "trade up" to higher-priced brands, especially those bearing designer labels.
The new campaign represents a gamble for Fruit of the Loom because the company does not want to alienate traditional, value-minded buyers as it tries to attract younger, less conventional consumers with offerings like men's boxers and boxer briefs and women's thongs and bikini briefs. For instance, the waistbands of some kinds of boxer briefs are emblazoned with the initials "FTL" in place of "Fruit of the Loom" or the familiar fruit emblem.
"The answer was in the brand itself," said William A. Mulligan Jr., client services director at Warwick Baker, because consumers who were asked to talk about Fruit of the Loom in research sessions used words like "approachable, sexy, wholesome, friendly, relevant."
So while a television commercial for men's apparel features buff, shirtless 20-somethings, they are smiling and clean-cut rather than sullen and sprouting stubble.
"In keeping with the broad appeal of the brand," said John Wendler, senior vice president for marketing at Fruit of the Loom in Bowling Green, Ky., the models are intended to be "all-American, regular guys who want to wear fashionable products," rather than "chiseled, edgy, European-looking."
"The advertising is graphically representative of the new stylishness of our product lines," Mr. Wendler said. "It captures all the positives about the brand while reinterpreting it and re-presenting it as up to trend, as it were."
The campaign places emphasis on what executives at Fruit of the Loom and Warwick Baker refer to as the brand's "fruitness," which Mr. O'Neill described as an "essential playfulness and friskiness, capturing the fit and fashion."
For example, the commercial shows vignettes with tongue-in-cheek titles: "Peeling Fruit," for a tot removing his T-shirt; "Wild Fruit," for a man romping with his dog in a field. And print ads for women's apparel carry such headlines as "Instead of Serving Fruit, Why Not Let Fruit Serve You?" and "You're Not the First Woman in the World to be Tempted by Fruit."
Fruit of the Loom previously tried to modify attitudes about its products with a humorous campaign by offices of the Leo Burnett Company that was centered on clotheslines displaying colorful apparel.
"The campaign was very successful and really got noticed," Mr. Wendler said, "but it was a little bit limited" because "it relied on a very strong visual device."
" 'Every body loves Fruit' gives us the flexibility to advertise our broad range of products," he added, "and portrays the products in a more stylish manner than 'Clotheslines' did." Burnett resigned the account rather than take part in a review that began in October.
The new commercials will run during television programs like "E.R.," "N.Y.P.D. Blue," "The X-Files" and the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League championship finals. Print ads will appear in such magazines as Essence, Glamour, Good Housekeeping, Mademoiselle, Parents, People, TV Guide and Vogue. As for the outdoor ads, Mr. Wendler said, "we are considering high-visibility locations like Times Square in addition to general outdoor around the country, to make a statement about what the brand is all about today."
Was any thought given to reviving the "Fruit Guys," the actors who once brought to life the fruit in the brand's emblem?
"Not for long," Mr. O'Neill answered, laughing. Though "they did a wonderful job" demonstrating fruitness, he said, it was "in a different time and place."
Besides, one Fruit Guy would probably demand a raise: F. Murray Abraham, who went on to win an Academy Award for "Amadeus."

HEADLINE: Board Gives Final Approval to New Rule on Derivatives

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
The nation's accounting rule makers said yesterday that they had given final approval to a new rule that will force companies to record the value of derivatives in their financial statements.
The move was immediately criticized by the banking industry and other groups, which have complained so loudly in Washington about the rule in recent months that a bill has been introduced to weaken the power of the private rule-making body, known as the Financial Accounting Standards Board. 
 Edmund L. Jenkins, the chairman of the accounting board, said that the new rule was needed to help protect investors in cases where companies might be investing heavily in derivatives that could result in huge losses. He added that the intense criticism had made it even more important for the board to act.
Several years ago, the accounting board decided to weaken another proposed rule on the accounting of employee stock options after companies complained to Congress.
"If the board had backed down on derivatives, I think it would have made it very difficult for the board to be an effective standard-setter in the future," Mr. Jenkins said. "It is crucial that we have independent standard-setting."
The seven members of the accounting board voted unanimously to approve the new rule during balloting that concluded late last week.
Derivatives are complicated financial contracts between two or more parties where the contract's value is tied to an underlying asset or pre-existing index. Companies use derivatives such as swaps and futures contracts to reduce the risk they face from fluctuating foreign currencies or interest rates.
The new rule will require companies to record the market value of the derivatives on their balance sheets and to include the gains or losses on those contracts in income. Most companies must start using the rule in January 2000 -- a month that company executives are already worried about because of the potential havoc that the millennium date could have on computers.
Banks and other companies said that the rule was not practical. They said that companies already provided enough information on derivatives in notes that must be included with financial statements.
Last year, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, sided with the banks and urged the accounting board to refrain from dramatic rules changes. Mr. Greenspan warned that the new rule could keep companies from using derivatives and could "constrain prudent risk management practices."
But at times, companies have created more risk for themselves by entering the derivative contracts. For example, Procter & Gamble lost tens of millions of dollars in 1994 on derivative contracts that were tied to interest rates.
"Unfortunately, there are some who have been trying to force the F.A.S.B. to not issue this standard, preventing valuable information from reaching investors," Mr. Jenkins said. "We must avoid placing the interests of any particular group over the consumers' interests."
All publicly held companies must follow the rules of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a privately financed group based in Norwalk, Conn. The Securities and Exchange Commission can sanction any company that does not abide by the board's rules.
Under a bill introduced by Representative Richard H. Baker, any accounting rule proposed by the accounting board would have to be approved by Federal regulators at the S.E.C. The bill by Mr. Baker, a Louisiana Republican, would also make it easier for companies to challenge the new accounting rules in court.
Senator Lauch Faircloth, a North Carolina Republican, has introduced another bill that would exempt banks from using the new derivatives rule unless banking regulators give their approval.
In a statement yesterday, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a group that includes banks and other companies, said the new rule was "a flawed product adopted in a process that ignored widespread dissent."
But Mr. Jenkins said that the board had considered the comments by the banks and other companies during more than 140 meetings it had on the proposed rule. In response to the comments, the board delayed the rule's effective date by two years and agreed that companies' meeting certain requirements would not have to include the changes in a derivative's value in income.
The accounting board was created in 1972 as a private sector body, Mr. Jenkins said, to try to keep politics and the "self-serving objectives of special interest groups" out of the rule-making process.
Many investor groups, government officials and companies have urged Congress not to change the process of setting the nation's accounting rules, which are widely considered to be the strongest in the world.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong's Latin Competitor;
Panama's 'Den of Pirates' Tries to Upgrade Its Image

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: COLON, Panama

 BODY:
"A den of pirates," one American Government official snorted when asked about the warren of shops, warehouses and banks just off the Caribbean entrance to the Panama Canal. In recent books, the spy novelist John Le Carre has portrayed the 1.5-square-mile walled compound as a steamy, seedy nest of intrigue where, for the right price and with the right contacts, just about anything goes.
That much isn't fiction. The free-trade zone here is the largest in the world outside Hong Kong, selling more than $6.2 billion in goods in 1997 to customers from all over Latin America and the Caribbean. 
 But name a dubious commercial activity of interest to American law-enforcement or intelligence agencies, and chances are someone has been caught doing it in Colon. The laundering of drug money, the smuggling of arms to guerrilla and paramilitary groups in South and Central America, the sale of goods to Cuba in defiance of the American economic embargo, the counterfeiting of trademarks -- all have traditionally been part of the local landscape, perhaps reaching a peak during the corrupt military dictatorship of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
But now, as it prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary, the Colon Free Zone is trying to clean up its act. With competing duty-free centers popping up all over the Western Hemisphere, it is scrambling to hold onto the business that for decades it all but owned. Huge new ports have been built, rail lines upgraded, fees lowered and inefficiencies attacked. And, to make sure the world takes the image change seriously, it has begun one of the harshest crackdowns on money laundering in the hemisphere.
"We want to position ourselves for the 21st century as a huge distribution and transshipment center to all of Latin America," said Nessim S. Bassan, vice president of the Fila Sportwear Corporation and a former president of the Colon Free Zone Users' Association.
Established in June 1948, the Colon Free Zone has enjoyed a virtual monopoly on free trade in Latin America for most of its existence because governments almost everywhere else imposed high tariffs on foreign goods to protect inefficient domestic industries.
For smugglers, this protectionism created a market of 450 million people stretching from Tijuana just south of the American border to Tierra del Fuego at South America's southernmost tip. Merchants from Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Haiti, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and other nearby countries flocked here, knowing they could always find the electronic appliances, car parts, clothing, liquor, perfume and jewelry their customers wanted but could not obtain legally at home.
Asian manufacturers were especially quick to pour their goods into the free-zone pipeline; today, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan account for about 60 percent of the goods sold from here.
But in the global economy of the 1990's, many of the old protectionist barriers have fallen, a process that is expected to accelerate as a result of the April summit meeting of hemispheric heads of state in Santiago, Chile. Spurred by the North American Free Trade Agreement and other regional pacts, countries throughout Latin America are racing to open their markets, and rival free-trade zones have now emerged to challenge Colon's hegemony at sites as far-flung as Miami, Manaus in Brazil, Iquique in Chile and Ciudad del Este, Paraguay.
"They are going to have to reinvent themselves," said Victoria Figge, the Free Zone's Government-appointed chief administrator from 1994 to 1997 and now the head of the Panamanian Government's money-laundering monitoring unit. "The rules of the game worldwide are totally different now, and they have to adjust themselves to these new conditions and better exploit our privileged geographic position" at the mouth of the Panama Canal.
Not everybody thinks they are up to the task. Richard Wainio, the just-retired director of planning for the Panama Canal Commission, the American Government body charged with administering the waterway until its handover to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, predicts that Colon's role will shrink as trade expands.
"I'm one of the doomsayers," Mr. Wainio said. "The zone is a huge operation, and it's not going to disappear. But the future lies in container transshipment, not warehousing. As barriers come down and you have a free flow of goods, you don't need that kind of operation conducted, legally or no, out of the zone."
Traders here, though, say they are adjusting to the new realities, and they point to a 15.6 percent increase in business last year as proof. Even with the regional boom in free trade, they argue, it is both quicker and cheaper for merchants in nearby countries to rely on Colon as a distribution point than to deal directly with manufacturers in Asia or the United States.
"We are a huge warehouse," with up to $1.5 billion in goods on hand at any time, said Nidal Waked, the current president of the users' association that represents the zone's almost 1,600 businesses. "We have everything here. If you want to put together a container with a thousand different products, you can do it here, and we can get it to you in almost no time."
Foreign manufacturers also have reason to retain the Colon connection rather than to export directly to Latin American buyers, merchants here said. "We know what the Colombian, the Venezuelan, the Chilean likes because we have people who travel there every two weeks to visit clients," said Mr. Waked, whose family business, Vida Panama, sells refrigerators, washing machines, stoves and microwave ovens. "I suppose that the big brands could do that, but they would have to start from zero, and why do that when we are here and have 50 years of experience?"
In recent years, the zone's growth was slowed by high fees, inefficiency, corruption and theft at the nearby port of Cristobal. But that problem has been attacked by huge investments in projects to speed up the shipment of goods across the isthmus. A pair of giant container terminals have recently opened here, two more are nearing completion, and a railway line across the isthmus is being renovated. All these measures have ended Cristobal's monopoly and slashed freight costs in half.
At the same time, Panamanian authorities have taken drastic action to make Colon less attractive to the drug cartels from Colombia and Mexico that have laundered billions of dollars here over the years. Since 1996, businesses here have been required to declare all transactions that exceed $10,000, for instance, and can no longer accept traditional forms of payment like money orders, traveler's checks, third-party transfers or checks drawn on Mexican banks.
Those rules -- which on paper are even tougher than those in the United States -- have not been especially popular among traders, who argue that they are losing business to other free zones, Miami in particular. In any case, many of them have never acquired the habit of asking questions of their clients.
"Where the money comes from, I can't say," said Marcos Almed Meza, a salesman for Nemo Traders, a small merchant house that sells clothing and electronic appliances. "If a customer has made a declaration, then it's not my problem."
Thus far, the efforts to clean up traditional financing practices have drawn mixed reviews. While Panamanian officials tend to emphasize the progress that has been made, their American counterparts take a more jaundiced view.
"I think they want to wean themselves from this, but they don't quite know how to do it yet," said an American Government official who specializes in money laundering. "Something has happened to open the dialogue, but I have to be very candid: This isn't a honeymoon, and we are not going to be happy until the whole system is disabled."
"They've seen the erosion of their traditional franchises, tax evasion and smuggling and black marketeering, since they are not the sole source anymore," the official continued. "So they feel they have to start tightening up and not be tagged as a rogue money-laundering center."
Traders here have drawn the line, however, at helping the United States enforce its economic embargo against Cuba. For decades, the Cuban Government has come here to buy products it cannot obtain from the United States -- from television sets and air-conditioners for hotels to car parts and pharmaceuticals -- and is treated as a prized customer.
Panamanian businesses, Ms. Figge said, "have the right to deal with whomever we want, as long as we do so according to our laws." But "if an American company uses the Free Zone to divert its products to Cuba, that's a different matter," she added, one best resolved by American authorities. "What can we do under our laws to stop it?" she asked.
Concerns about weapons deals also persist, especially in light of recent news reports of arms shipments to Croatia and to both paramilitary and guerrilla forces in neighboring Colombia that appear to have been channeled through the Free Zone. But Giovanni Ferrari, vice president of Farmazona, a pharmaceutical concern, who is also a former president of the users' association, dismissed such dealings as an aberration of the Noriega period.
"You need a large degree of tolerance on the part of the government to do those operations, which is no longer the case in Panama," he said. "The cronies who operated with carte blanche in the Free Zone are not there anymore, so I would say there is very, very little of that. In fact, I would even go so far as to say it may have been eradicated."

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Transit Union Goes on Strike Over Rules

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, June 1

 BODY:
After three months of fruitless negotiations, the city's largest transit union went on strike today, shutting down a nexus of buses, trolleys and subways that serves up to 435,000 people a day.
Because negotiations had been going on since March, the city was not caught unawares. The municipal government and many employers had contingency plans in place for their workers that included private buses, extra cars on the regional railroads that continue to operate and free parking throughout the city. 
 For those who live in the suburbs, the strike meant somewhat heavier rush-hour traffic, and Mayor Edward G. Rendell said downtown businesses might suffer. But the largest burden seemed to fall on working-class people who rely on public transportation to reach school and work.
Negotiations for a three-year labor agreement that had proceeded intermittently broke off after a brief session on Sunday with management and union leaders agreeing only that vast differences remained in their bargaining positions.
Certain that no breakthrough was possible, Steven Brookens, president of the Transport Workers Union 234, appeared at a morning news conference to announce that his 5,400 members would walk off their jobs as drivers and maintenance workers at noon. They did, and three hours later several hundred strikers staged a noisy demonstration at City Hall and briefly blocked traffic in front of management headquarters.
"It's over," Mr. Brookens said. "We tried the best we could."
John K. Leary Jr., general manager of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, spoke to reporters as the strike began. "We hoped it would not have gotten to this point," he said. "It's a crying shame. This is senseless. It's needless. Our riders deserve much better than this."
Philadelphians are accustomed to disputes between transit unions and the transportation authority. This was the fifth work stoppage in 21 years, the second in 3 years; there was a two-week shutdown of the system in 1995.
But a strike was hardly welcome when Philadelphia is marketing itself as a reborn urban center, rich with tourist attractions, vibrant night life and world-class cultural sites. And the city had become one of a half-dozen contenders for the Republican national convention in 2000.
It was just too bad for Mr. Rendell, a Democrat, that the Republicans' site selection committee picked today to start a three-day visit.
Union leaders are particularly opposed to proposed changes in workplace rules, including liberal use of part-time workers. They saymanagement is insisting on the changes as a wedge to destroy the union.
But management officials, clinging to a stance they have held since negotiations began, said today that the offer they made on Saturday, which replicates a deal that the city's other transit union overwhelmingly accepted and includes a 9 percent pay increase over three years, was the best the striking union could expect.
"We put together a package that represents a wonderful economic deal," said David L. Cohen, the transportation authority's chief labor strategist and former chief of staff to Mr. Rendell.
Mr. Rendell said in an interview that he had urged union leaders to accept what he called "an outstanding offer" from the authority.
"The problem," Mr. Rendell said, "is that anything other than this deal would require a raise in fares, which are already the highest in the nation. That would mean a decline in service. Then we would lose ridership, and that would cost the union jobs."
Mr. Rendell said he was especially disturbed that the union would choose the Republicans' first event, a visit to Independence Mall, for a demonstration. Philadelphia has not been host to a national political convention in 50 years.
Republicans and contingency plans aside, the start of the strike caused many problems.
Bradford Eads, a security guard at Temple University who usually takes a bus, hitched a ride home with a neighbor but got there an hour later than usual.
For Tempris Smiley, a sixth grader who takes a bus and subway each way to school, the strike means forgoing the final two weeks of classes.
"This will cause me to fail," she said, although Mr. Rendell said he expected schools to make allowances for absences or tardiness.
Even striking drivers expressed uncertainty over a work stoppage that some union members said could last months. At the Midvale District depot, where drivers exchanged their empty buses for picket signs, Bernie Grant, 30, a bus driver for five years, watched the scene unfold with mixed emotions.
All around him, his colleagues were barking out their protest chants.
"They might look like they're having a good time," he said. "But you've got to stand up for what you believe in and be strong. Nobody wants to be out here, and I may be smiling on the outside. But inside, I'm hurting."

HEADLINE: Jawboning Russian Markets

 BODY:
You know you are on new economic terrain when the White House decides to rush out a pronouncement on Russia on a Sunday, not because of some impending Russian Government action but in hopes of influencing financial markets to be more inclined to lend money to the Moscow Government.
President Clinton's efforts to jawbone Russian markets were, at least initially, no more successful than previous Presidents' efforts to talk up American financial markets in times of crisis. Panicked investors are not inclined to be reassured by vague promises of support, such as the White House offered when it said the United States would back "additional conditional financial support from the international financial institutions, as necessary, to promote stability and structural reform in Russia." 
 The most important word in Mr. Clinton's statement was "conditional," and it points us toward the real game that is being played here. The President is supporting the current international policy of delaying a large bailout until there is evidence of real reform. In plain language, the United States and the International Monetary Fund want Russia's Government to prove that it can collect revenues even before the badly needed reform of the tax code makes its way through the Russian Parliament.
Pressure in the opposition direction -- that is, for a bailout now -- is coming from the big investors who regret going into Russia and have driven down the Russian stock and government bond markets. It is a dangerous and expensive game, but in the absence of a major collapse, Mr. Clinton is right to press for internal reform as a prerequisite for aid.
All that makes it important for Boris Fyodorov, the country's new tax czar, to step up collections. That means Russia will have to operate like a modern state in wringing taxes from the clearly profitable but politically protected enterprises that have managed to ignore the tax laws. At the same time he must persuade people across Russia that the system is being administered fairly. That will not be easy, particularly given the corruption in the tax service that Mr. Fyodorov spoke of yesterday.
The most hopeful sign for the Russian Government yesterday came in reports that it was talking to a group of foreign financial institutions, including some from the United States, about an interim loan. That could help to restore confidence, particularly if it is clear the money is being provided without any promises of a bailout from international agencies.

Travelers to Get 25% Stake in Japanese Brokerage House

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 1

 BODY:
The Travelers Group and the Nikko Securities Company formally announced an agreement today that will give the Wall Street powerhouse a 25 percent stake in Japan's third-largest securities brokerage firm for $1.6 billion. The deal immediately raised questions about how quickly the Japanese financial industry would consolidate.
The Travelers-Nikko alliance, which had been expected since reports of it first appeared here on Friday, came as Japan is undergoing a broad-based financial restructuring aimed at making its markets as flexible as those in New York and London by 2001. Japanese and foreign companies are exploring possible combinations that will help them better compete in this new arena, and in markets around the world. 
 "The tie-up between Japanese financial institutions and foreign institutions will accelerate," said Yukiko Ohara, a bank analyst with SBC Warburg Japan Ltd. "Japanese financial institutions need a good product. They have a very strong client base, but they will lose clients if they have no tie-up."
The deal also raised concern among competitors and clients of the two companies. For instance, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, until today the largest shareholder in Nikko with 3.1 percent, had envisioned forging its own Nikko alliance. That is no longer a possibility, and a spokesman said today that Bank of Tokyo would have to revise its strategy toward the securities business.
Nikko has been losing money and is considered poorly prepared to face the challenges of financial deregulation in Japan on its own. But the partnership with Travelers, the parent of Salomon Smith Barney, will marry a savvy American financial- services conglomerate to a formidable distribution network in a potentially lucrative Japanese market.
For Travelers, which has agreed to merge with Citicorp in a record $70 billion transaction, the deal with Nikko helps round out its vision of becoming the world's leading diversified financial company, one that would some day be a household name in all major markets.
"Our creating a partnership with Nikko will allow us to be more productive not only in this marketplace but all around the world," said Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Travelers, at a joint news conference here today with Masashi Kaneko, Nikko Securities' president.
Mr. Kaneko said the world is witnessing "the global consolidation of the financial industry."
The partners said that in January they would establish Nikko Salomon Smith Barney Ltd., a $1 billion joint venture that will trade securities, advise on mergers and acquisitions, underwrite stocks and bonds, and produce economic research. Travelers will become Nikko's largest shareholder and take the first seat by a foreign company on Nikko's board.
In exchange, Travelers will purchase 9.5 percent of Nikko's common stock for 70 billion yen -- about $507 million -- and a further 15.5 percent ownership interest in the form of convertible bonds, for 150 billion yen, or about $1.1 billion. Nikko will spend between $72 million and $360 million buying up Travelers shares.
The deal raises the stakes for both foreign and domestic companies operating in Japan. Some may begin to feel edged out of a changing financial playing field.
"The number of potential brides, or marriage partners, drops down by one and there aren't that many with the size of distribution network that Nikko has," said James P. Fiorillo, a financial analyst at ING Barings in Japan. "The effect of all this is that domestic firms are scrambling to react. Foreign firms are scrambling. And the number of potential partners is starting to fall dramatically."
Japan has as many as 200 brokerage houses, most of them small or medium-sized firms that have been comfortable under such regulatory practices as fixed commissions. Many are expected to face enormous difficulties competing in a less regulated marketplace.
Mr. Kaneko said today that Nikko would be expanding its branch network, building small offices in many places. He also said the bank would cut costs by disposing of physical assets and reducing fringe benefits and entertainment costs.
No layoffs will result, he said.
Although Travelers is taking only 49 percent ownership in the new joint venture, Nikko, which gets the rest, runs the risk of domination by its foreign partner. Many ailing Japanese companies face the same risk as they strike alliances and partnerships with overseas firms primarily seeking a ready-made list of clients.
"Nikko will run the risk of losing weight because the company will move its most promising areas of business, like investment banking business, to the new joint venture," said Yushiro Ikuyo, a financial analyst at Commerz Securities Japan, who formerly worked at Smith Barney here. "Nikko may end up becoming a marketing representative for Travelers' financial products."

Yamaichi's Last Report
By Agence France-Presse
 The Yamaichi Securities Company, the collapsed Japanese brokerage house, presented its last earnings report yesterday, disclosing that it was insolvent with debts exceeding assets by $162 million.
Yamaichi's liabilities at the end of March totaled 600.2 billion yen ($4.35 billion), some 22.5 billion yen short of its assets, the company said.
The brokerage house, once the fourth largest in Japan, closed all offices on March 31, but client assets are still being returned and it is still selling unlisted securities.
Yamaichi's president, Shohei Nozawa, said the deficit would not affect the repayment of special loans from the Japanese central bank, which are extended to major companies in times of crisis.
The Japanese Finance Ministry said that Yamaichi shareholders' equity dropped to 190 billion yen at the end of last year from 431.3 billion yen a month before the collapse on Nov. 24.

HEADLINE: Reports Show U.S. Economy Remains Solid

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 1

 BODY:
Asia's economic crisis hurt United States manufacturing in May as exports faltered and cheap imports pressured factory profits, an industry report showed.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said today that its index declined to 51.4 last month from 52.9 in April. May's drop was the second straight, leading to the lowest reading since October 1996. Any reading over 50, however, means manufacturing is still growing. 
 Separately, United States construction spending rose eight-tenths of a percent in April, to $630.1 billion, the Commerce Department said today. That was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and followed a one-tenth of a percent increase in March, suggesting domestic demand is vibrant.
The drop in the National Association of Purchasing Management index underscored that Asia's slowdown is taking a toll as expected. "There is continuing concern about the impact of the Asian economic situation on exports and imports," said Norbert Ore, chairman of the purchasing group's survey committee.

HEADLINE: Ernest Bloch, 77, an Authority On Company Finance at N.Y.U.

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Ernest Bloch, an authority on corporate finance who taught at New York University and wrote widely on economic and financial affairs, died on May 15 in Tisch Hospital at N.Y.U. Medical Center.
Dr. Bloch, a former resident of lower Manhattan, was 77 and lived at Heritage Hills in Somers, N.Y. 
 The cause was liver and kidney failure, his family said.
Dr. Bloch wrote a classic work in his field, "Inside Investment Banking," in 1986 (Irwin). He retired from N.Y.U. in 1991 but continued to teach there part time until four years ago.
A native of Baden-Baden, Germany, he went to France to get an education when the Nazis came to power in 1933. He emigrated to the United States in 1939 and was a staff sergeant in the 10th Armored Division, interrogating German prisoners of war as Gen. George S. Patton's Third Army fought its way across France and Germany.
He graduated from City College in 1947 and received a master's degree at Columbia University in 1949. He received his Ph.D. at the New School for Social Research in 1962 while working as a research economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Dr. Bloch joined the N.Y.U. faculty that year to teach corporate finance, monetary policy and money and banking.
The author of many articles on those subjects, he was named the Charles W. Gerstenberg Professor of Finance at the Graduate School of Business Administration in 1966 and became chairman of the finance department in the late 1970's.
Dr. Bloch was a consultant to many private corporations and the Bank of Japan, and organized an N.Y.U. program to train investment banking executives for Deutsche Bank.
Leading investment bankers visited his classes as guest lecturers.
Dr. Bloch is survived by his wife of 52 years, Amy Weiss Bloch, of Heritage Hills, and a son, Geoffrey, of Manhattan.

Jets Release Williams, One of '96 Gang of Four

BYLINE: By GERALD ESKENAZI 

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., June 1

 BODY:
The Jets lost another key component of the high-profile influx of offense they made two years ago when they released right tackle David Williams today.
Williams, plagued with recurrent back problems that continually interrupted his Jets career, was about to retire in any event, and will most likely do so. But the release evoked memories of the Jets' failed 1996 attempt to buy an offense. 
 Williams was one of four highly touted free agents the Jets picked up for $57 million in long-term contracts in 1996: he joined quarterback Neil O'Donnell, left tackle Jumbo Elliott and wide receiver Jeff Graham.
The Jets were widely applauded for the bold moves in an attempt to come back from their 1995 record of 3-13. Instead, each of the four was injured at some point during the year, and the club wound up with a franchise-worst record of 1-15.
The Jets turned themselves around anyway, improving to 9-7 last year in Bill Parcells's first season as the coach, but with less help from Williams. Now, only Elliott is assured of a starter's role on the Jets next season. Graham was traded last draft day, while O'Donnell remains unwavering in his demand that he receive his full 1998 salary of $4.2 million. The club wants to cut that in half, and so his status remains unclear.
With Williams gone, Jason Fabini, a fourth-round draft pick from Cincinnati, a school that rarely produces offensive linemen for the pros, now becomes a candidate at right tackle. He is 6 feet 7 inches and 310 pounds, and if he can make the lineup, it will give the Jets a pair of bookend tackles of spectacular size.
"I've got a bit of a logjam at right tackle," Parcells said today as the week of rookie camp began. In addition to Fabini, there is the veteran Siupeli Malamala, who was once the club's starter at the position, as well as the rookie Eric Bateman of Brigham Young and Deron Thorp of Nevada, who spent last season playing for the Barcelona Dragons of the N.F.L. Europe.
For Fabini, whose time in the 40-yard run is slow but whose movements off the snap are quick, the shift to the right side should not be a problem. He played left tackle in college.
"But I'm right-handed," he said. "And anyway, I've been playing football since the fourth grade."
Parcells wants a player like Fabini to make it for two obvious reasons: he could have a long run with the team, and he is cheaper to sign. The Jets are only now getting some freedom from the salary cap that has hung over them since the four-player signing of 1996. Parcells has a few million dollars and would like even more for what he calls "fudge money," emergency funds. The club saves about $300,000 toward this year's cap in releasing Williams.
Fabini doesn't yet understand all the economics. After all, he got his degree in business only last December. Then he went to work for a money manager.
"If I didn't make it in football," he said, "I had my degree."
Still, on draft day, when he wasn't taken in the first three rounds, he was close to throwing something. Then Parcells called him and told him he was Jet.
"It was neat to be drafted," he said, "but now I've got to do some things."
 
EXTRA POINTS
DORIAN BOOSE, the Jets' top draft pick, was a close friend and Washington State teammate of Eric Bender, the Raiders' second-round draft pick who was found dead Saturday at a business associate's home in Marietta, Ga. Boose and Bender were roommates, both played defensive line, and both often talked of making it in the National Football League. "We all knew he had a problem with epilepsy," Boose said, "but he hadn't had an episode in three and a half years. The last time I saw him was at graduation, when we congratulated each other and gave each other a hug." The two used to roughhouse in hotel rooms the morning of games, Boose recalled. "We'd tackle each other, but once we heard the bed crack, we'd stop." Boose said his wife, BRENDA, was to speak at a memorial service for Bender.
The Jets will not be looking at DAVID MEGGETT, Coach BILL PARCELLS said, despite the fact that Meggett was one of his favorite players. "I'm only interested in him as a person," Parcells said. Meggett was cut last week by the Patriots. He has not recovered from a broken foot and faces a trial on sexual assault charges.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Rise, Aided by Continued Strength in the Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose yesterday, helped by continued strength in the dollar and a weak manufacturing survey
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32, to 104 30/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.77 percent, from 5.80 percent on Friday. 
 Tumbling stocks in Hong Kong and elsewhere also gave an early lift to bonds, as foreign investors sought the relative safety of the Treasury market.
The market decline and worsening economic problems in Asia lifted the dollar to its third consecutive seven-year high against the yen. A strengthening dollar increases the return on dollar-denominated securities when proceeds are converted into their home currencies.
"The flight to quality is the kicker that's moving us up," said David Jallits, who helps oversee about $5.5 billion of global bonds at Strategic Fixed-Income L.P. in Arlington, Va.
Bonds also got a lift after a report suggested the economy might be losing steam, adding to speculation that Asia's slowdown will rein in growth in the United States, quell inflation and keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates soon.
The National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly manufacturing index fell to 51.4 in May from 52.9 a month earlier. The group's index of prices paid, an inflation gauge, fell to 41.1, from 41.2 in April.
"It looks like the manufacturing side of the economy is weakening a bit," said Timothy Wilhide, who helps oversee about $54 billion at the Hartford Investment Management Company in Hartford.
Still, bonds retreated from their highs as traders were reluctant to load up after recent price increases.
Elsewhere in the market, the Treasury sold $13 billion of new three-month and six-month bills at its regular weekly auction. Following are the results of that auction:

HEADLINE: Military Budget in India Is Increased by 14 Percent

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, June 1

 BODY:
Declaring that there can be "no compromise on defense preparedness" in the wake of the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan, the Government of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced today that it has approved large budget increases for the country's armed forces, as well as for nuclear research and missile programs.
In their first budget, the Hindu nationalist leaders who head the country's coalition Government revealed that military outlays will go up by 14 percent, part of which will pay wage increases for India's 1.6 million troops. The budget increase is among the largest ever made by India in peacetime, and will push total military outlays to the equivalent of $12.4 billion, about 19 percent of total Government outlays of $64.3 billion. Indian economists estimate the total annual output of the Indian economy at about $265 billion. 
 The military increases were dwarfed by increases of 68 percent for the Atomic Energy Commission, in charge of civilian and military nuclear programs, and 62 percent for the Department of Space, which helps develop rockets that India has used to launch space satellites as well as military variants the Vajpayee Government has said will be equipped with nuclear warheads. Together, the outlays on nuclear and missile research will amount to $665 million, up $262 million from last year.
Yashwant Sinha, the Finance Minister, also announced large increases in spending on education, health, family welfare and development programs for women and children, the core of India's efforts to relieve the dire poverty and illiteracy that afflict more than 350 million of its 980 million people. But even with an increase of 35 percent, the total outlay for these programs, about $2.6 billion, was only fractionally more than the budget for military hardware, and about 20 percent of the overall defense outlay.
Many Indians were surprised that the budget appeared to have made no allowance for the economic sanctions the United States has imposed on India, as well as Pakistan, in the wake of the nuclear tests. Mr. Sinha, who appeared to have made his plans on the basis of the tax revenues, investment flows and growth rates that were forecast before the nuclear blasts, predicted a doubling of foreign investment within two years, encouraged by new steps he announced to ease bureaucratic obstacles to new projects, and to selling off large chunks of some of the best-known state-controlled enterprises. One of those will be Indian Airlines, the country's troubled domestic air carrier.
Mr. Sinha said he was confident that the sanctions would not "have any significant impact on our economic development."
But the Finance Minister appeared anxious to counter some of the harshest criticism the nuclear tests on May 11 and 13 have prompted in India. While opinion polls continue to show approval ratings of 80 percent for the tests, newspaper editorials, speeches by opposition leaders and street protests have offered a different view -- that the Vajpayee Government has betrayed the hopes of millions of India's ill-nourished, illiterate and disease-prone citizens by committing the country to the vast costs of a nuclear arsenal.
Mr. Sinha, 60, a former civil servant and diplomat who only recently joined the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu nationalist party that came to power 10 weeks ago at the head of a 14-party coalition, told Parliament that in drafting the budget he had used a moral standard set by Mohandas K. Gandhi, India's independence leader. "I have recalled to myself the face of the poorest and weakest man I have seen and made sure that this budget is of use to him," he said.
Since India's nuclear tests, senior officials in the Vajpayee Government have said the country will mount nuclear warheads on a range of missiles that have been test-fired in recent years.
But Western diplomats said today that the budget increases, while steep, did not necessarily mean that India intended to proceed immediately with missile deployments, a step some Indian military analysts have said will cost at least $1 billion a year. Mr. Sinha told reporters that once the Government had take a firm decision on "weaponization," he would return to Parliament for more money on top of the defense increases in the budget. The diplomats said that the new outlays could be intended for stepped-up research on warheads and missiles, and for new missile tests that Indian scientists have already said are pending, with actual operational deployment still months or years away.

HEADLINE: Russia's Finance Picture Darkens Further as Market Falls

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 1

 BODY:
Despite President Clinton's effort to bring about an end to Russia's financial crisis, the outlook continued to darken today.
The Russian stock market fell by more than than 10 percent, and there were signs of strain among banks and in Russia's futures market. 
 The major test will come on Wednesday when the Government tries to sell eight billion rubles worth of treasury bills -- some for a term as short as seven days. Analysts fear that the Government will find it difficult to find buyers, further unnerving legions of jittery investors.
This is not what Washington had hoped for when Mr. Clinton said on Sunday that the United States was ready to support additional financial aid to Russia.
The International Monetary Fund said on Friday that it expected to disburse $670 million in assistance this month. And the statement by Mr. Clinton was intended to underscore American support for an international effort that would go well beyond that, if needed.
Mr. Clinton's statement contained no figures or details about how or when the additional assistance might be organized. But the theory was that the Clinton Administration could soothe investors simply by publicizing Washington's willingness to help.
"It was a very good statement," said Yegor T. Gaidar, the former Prime Minister who has been advising Prime Minister Sergei V. Kiriyenko. "It is exactly what the markets now need to hear."
But today the markets appeared to turn a deaf ear. Investors said the slide reflected a number of factors, among them the vagueness of Mr. Clinton's pledge.
Russia's Central Bank has about $14.5 billion in reserves, about $10 billion of which is in cash reserves that can be readily spent to prop up the ruble. Some Western bankers say Russia needs an international line of credit for an additional $10 billion.
"There have been a lot of good words about potential actions," a European investment banker said. "But the fact is this market has been hurt so badly that words alone may not accomplish anything."
Beyond that, investors remained worried about the durability of Russian financial system, which is being rocked by the turmoil on the world's financial markets.
Russia's banks have lost huge sums in the stock market and are short of cash. One leading bank, Tokobank, has already been placed in receivership by the Central Bank, as bank officials and creditors try to negotiate a restructuring of its debt.
In particular, the banks are being squeezed by the Central Bank's decision to raise interest rates to 150 percent, a move that was taken to discourage currency speculation.
"To some extent the market is less worried about the solvency of the Government than about the solvency of the banking system," said Tom Adshead, co-director of research at United Financial Group here.
Today, Russian officials did their best to project an image of quiet competence. Mr. Kiriyenko summoned foreign bankers to a meeting, where he promised to win parliamentary support for tax reform and lower corporate tax rates.
"He let us know that he understood the situation was not just due to external factors," said a banker who attended the meeting. "He reiterated that there are internal actions that have to be taken."
To further mollify investors, officials say the Central Bank has been gradually moving to expand its reserve. Sergei Aleksashenko, the deputy chairman of the Central Bank, said the bank bought $400 million of foreign currency last week.
American officials praised the Government's efforts and stressed that they were consulting with industrialized nations in the Group of Eight, which includes Russia, about how to help Moscow.
Underscoring the need for industrialized nations to cooperate in developing an aid package for Russia, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, speaking in Vienna, warned today that the economic distress in Russia could spread. "Russia's problem has the potential to become in turn Central Europe's and the world's," he said.
Still, the somewhat distant prospect of additional help failed to boost Russia's financial markets. Brokers here said the trading on the stock exchange was minimal, because of a lack of buyers.
Russia's futures market suspended trading after some participants failed to fulfill their obligations. The exchange rate for the ruble worsened slightly, slipping 0.34 points to 6.172 to the dollar.
Aleksandr Potyomkin, a senior Central Bank official, said the Government was counting on several sources to raise desperately needed revenue. Loans from international financial institutions like the I.M.F. and foreign governments, he said, were "crucial." Another source of funds is the auction of state property.
Mr. Kiriyenko signaled tonight that he was pressing ahead with an auction of the state's Rosneft oil company. The starting price will be $1.6 billion. That is about $500 million less than the Government had hoped for in last week's auction, which was canceled for lack of bidders.
Beyond that, Russian officials are negotiating with foreign banks, which have been lining up to offer financing. The officials, however, are apprehensive about the terms.
"We have heard there are offers from five or six banks," a European banker said. "Most banks are of the view that Russia will eventually overcome this crisis of confidence by the investors."
In Moscow, Wednesday's sale of treasury bills was emerging as an important test.
The Government is trying to raise about 8 billion rubles ($1.3 billion) through Wednesday's sale. But that is an expensive way to finance the budget deficit. Because the interest rates the Government is offering are so high, some bills will mature in seven days.
The Russian Government has never before sold treasury securities for such a short period. By doing so, the Kremlin is trying to buy time and line up lower-cost financing.
Even so, some investment bankers, say the Government may not be able to sell all the bills. It would then have to dip into its reserves to buy some of its own securities.

HEADLINE: Golf Course Will Rise From a Bronx Garbage Heap

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
A bedraggled Bronx garbage heap -- heretofore a place for dumping stolen cars and, at least once, a human body -- will become a $22 million city-owned golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus, city officials said yesterday.
The course, the first new one in the city in 35 years, is planned for an undeveloped section of Ferry Point Park, in the shadow of the Whitestone Bridge. 
 Despite its municipal ownership and landfill locale, it will aim for a measure of exclusivity. The developers -- led by Mr. Nicklaus, one of the sport's most revered figures -- say the course and its amenities will be of country-club caliber. The number of golfers will be strictly limited, and the price will be almost twice the cost of a round on the other city-owned courses.
The plan, scheduled to be formally announced today by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, could be a boon for the growing number of golfers in the city and the region. With the sport's popularity rising, playing on one of the city's existing public courses can often be an ordeal, with tough competition for a tee time and near-gridlock on the fairways.
"We'll do something special for the Big Apple," Mr. Nicklaus said in a telephone interview yesterday. He has created a preliminary layout for the course based on pictures and maps of the site, but will see the location in person for the first time today.
Mr. Nicklaus, whose company has designed 152 courses, said he did not want to make the Ferry Point course too complicated. "I hope we don't make it too hard," he said. The development, which is scheduled to be completed in 2001, also includes plans for a white-tablecloth restaurant, a marina and an esplanade.
The construction cost will be completely financed by the developers, who, in turn, will receive a 35-year lease. In an escalating formula, the city would get at least $1.25 million a year beginning in 2001, rising to $3 million in the last five years of the lease. The plan, the largest license deal ever signed by the Parks Department, requires approval by the city's Art Commission, which reviews all design work for public property.
The expected price to play 18 holes will be nearly $40 on weekends for city residents, almost double the $20.50 at other city courses. But J. Pierre Gagne, a golf-course developer and one of Mr. Nicklaus's partners, said that would be a bargain given the quality of the course. He noted that many new courses open to the public charged $65 or more while country club memberships ranged from $30,000 to $150,000.
"This is quite an opportunity," he said. "It's a tremendous asset to the city of New York."
The ball fields and picnic area in the western portion of Ferry Point Park will not be affected by the golf course, which will cover the marshy, weedy eastern part of the 414-acre expanse. Over the years, city officials have proposed all manner of developments for the site, from a new Yankee Stadium to a football stadium to housing. The administration of Mayor Abraham D. Beame first suggested a golf course in 1976.
The site is near the interchange of the Hutchinson River Parkway and the Cross-Bronx and Bruckner Expressways, but there is no subway line nearby.
There appears to be little local opposition to the plan, with widespread sentiment that anything is better than a neglected landfill. "People in the neighborhood are longing to see this garbage dump become a nice thing," said Dart Westphal, president of the Bronx Council of Environmental Quality, an advocacy group.
Some advocates for green space, however, are upset about increasing concessions in parks, which they fear are leading to rampant privatization. "There are already plenty of golf courses on public land," said David Lutz, program director of the Neighborhood Open Spaces Coalition. "At the same time, there are many things the city lacks on public land," he added, suggesting a campground and nature educational centers.
Four bids were received for the site, with the runner-up group including Arnold Palmer as a partner and designer, parks officials said. The site was advertised twice in the last decade in golf business magazines, but there were no serious bids.
Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said the interest this time around was a result of a booming local and national economy and a ballooning interest in golf -- as well as a new spirit in the city. "It's part of the renaissance of New York that we're unrolling a first-class golf course on land that has been a wasteland for 50 years," he said.
The number of rounds played on the city courses increased to 885,497 last year from 580,588 in 1982. The city's courses, all run by concessionaires, had gross receipts of $22 million last year, $2.6 million of which went to the city.
The growing popularity of golf is already evident in the city. The pitch-and-putt course at Flushing Meadows Corona Park is having night lighting installed and is expanding to include mini-golf. The Randalls Island driving range's capacity is being doubled to 180 stalls. Under a program to instruct youth, the Professional Golfers Association is renovating Mosholu Golf Course in the Bronx. The concessionaire at the Forest Park course in Queens just spent more than $1 million in improvements.
Under the Ferry Point deal, the participants -- Mr. Nicklaus's Golden Bear International, based in North Palm Beach, Fla.; Gagne Development of White Plains, and the Flag Financial Corporation of New York City -- will spend $22 million to build the course, a driving range, a clubhouse, the marina and restaurant and a catering facility. They will also build the waterfront promenade, pedestrian and bicycle paths, picnic areas and restrooms, and will make improvements to an adjacent playground.
Flag, the financing arm, is putting up 65 percent of the investment. The other partners are evenly splitting the rest.
After the 35-year lease expires, the city can negotiate a deal with anyone or run the course itself.
The construction cost is significantly higher than the norm for a course, Mr. Gagne said, in part because of the difficulty of building on a landfill. This means the sub-surface materials must be minutely analyzed before development can begin.
"We can't just go out there with a bulldozer and start to shape the area," Mr. Gagne said.
Mr. Nicklaus, citing his experience in building a course on top of a toxic dump site in Montana, said soil would have to be brought in. "It's a golf course that will be built on top and not cut in," he said.
In 1937, the western portion of Ferry Point Park, once a ferry terminal, became a park with a number of athletic fields. The eastern portion was built primarily from rubble resulting from the construction of the Whitestone Bridge.
Only about eight or nine acres of the eastern portion have significant ecological value, said Mark A. Matsil, director of natural resources for the Parks Department. He said those parts were primarily sand dredged from the Rockaways, which support coastal grasslands, rather than invasive weeds, such as phragmites and mugwort. Sparrow hawks forage in those grasses.
Mr. Gagne said Mr. Nicklaus's preliminary design tried to work around the pristine features, particularly the bird habitat.
The architect for the clubhouse and other buildings will be Butler Rogers Baskett of New York. The firm designed Chelsea Piers, including its driving range, as well as the main building of the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club on Long Island.

HEADLINE: SEOUL LEADER ASKS END TO SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREANS

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, June 1

 BODY:
In an effort to ease a half-century of enmities on the Korean Peninsula, President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea called today for the United States and other Western countries to end sanctions against North Korea and to show greater flexibility in dealing with it.
Mr. Kim said that when he goes to Washington next week for a state visit, including an address to a joint meeting of Congress, he will urge the United States to give up its economic sanctions against North Korea. He will suggest, instead, a policy of increasing political "engagement" and growing economic ties as the best way to moderate the behavior of North Korea, the world's last Stalinist state. 
 While Western policies are not expected to change overnight, the pressures for a policy of greater engagement with the North have been building, and Mr. Kim's arguments are sure to carry weight in Washington and Tokyo.
In an hourlong interview today in the Blue House, the Presidential mansion, Mr. Kim emphasized that he had no illusions about the North, which has even in recent years sent armed infiltrators into South Korea and continues to aim a vast array of artillery at Seoul. But he also suggested that it was time to try a new approach to reduce the tensions and the risk of war.
"It would be desirable for the United States to ease its economic sanctions on North Korea," Mr. Kim said. "I think this would be more effective in efforts to get North Korea to open up and liberalize."
Under the Trading With the Enemy Act, American companies are basically banned from doing any business in or with North Korea. Some exceptions have been made, but the sanctions remain so broad that they have even prevented American basketball teams from signing up a 7-foot-9-inch North Korean basketball player, who would be the tallest player on record.
Mr. Kim, who took office in February, has made conciliatory statements about North Korea in the past, including suggestions for economic and cultural contacts between the two Koreas and proposals for an inter-Korean summit meeting.
But the comments today were his strongest call for change in the West's approach to North Korea. As recently as Friday he gave a Korean newspaper the standard response about American sanctions, that whether they should be lifted has to depend on "progress in inter-Korean relations."
Pressed on that point today, Mr. Kim made clear that he preferred that the United States lift sanctions, and not just amend them, and that it do so without setting conditions. He urged that the United States do that as part of a broad transformation of Western policy toward North Korea.
"I would like to see improvement in relations between Japan and North Korea and, in fact, between the rest of the Western world and North Korea," Mr. Kim said. "I believe these improved relations will lead to changes in North Korea and to North Korea's opening up."
Mr. Kim's nine-day visit to the United States beginning on Saturday will not just be about North Korea relations, but will also deal with a broad array of economic, cultural and political issues like efforts to reassure American investors about South Korean business prospects. The trip will also be a nostalgic homecoming for a onetime dissident who was exiled two times in America, who learned English from an American Peace Corps volunteer and who credits American pressure with saving his life when Korean dictators sought to kill him.
Yet few international problems have been so intractable over the last half-century as the cold war on the Korean Peninsula. President Clinton has called the "demilitarized zone" between the two Koreas "the scariest place on Earth."
Mr. Kim said one major purpose of his visit to America was "to win a more flexible stance in our two countries' dealings with North Korea."
In effect, Mr. Kim today made the same argument about North Korea that the Clinton Administration has made about China, that the best way to tame it is not to isolate it and punish it with sanctions, but rather to build economic and diplomatic ties that draw it out onto the international playing field.
In the past the United States has made some halfhearted efforts toward engagement, and it has lifted some sanctions. But each time Seoul has warned vociferously that Washington must not become too friendly with the enemy in the North.
Mr. Kim has from the start staked out a policy quite different from that of his predecessors. The previous President, Kim Young Sam, nursed an animus toward the North that dated at least from the murder of his mother by suspected North Korean infiltrators in 1960.
Kim Dae Jung was himself arrested and prepared for execution by North Korean officials, in the Korean War. But in contrast to past Presidents he has emphasized that South Korea's fundamental approach should not be to squeeze North Korea into submission, but rather to build trust and economic links.
"In the past economic cooperation was greatly restricted," Mr. Kim said. "We wish to lift all the restrictions, so that cooperation can take place in a free atmosphere.
"I expect to see a great activation of economic cooperation. This benefits not only the North Korean economy, but our economy, as well."
The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, has not responded to Mr. Kim's remarks in recent months or to his suggestions for an inter-Korean summit. President Kim conceded today that he was a bit disappointed by the lack of a North Korean response. Asked whether he still thought that a summit meeting might take place this year, he grinned and said, "Only a fortuneteller can answer that."
Still, he quickly added, "It is at least possible to be more hopeful than in the past."
Mr. Kim's call for an end to sanctions appears to be a deliberate effort to advance the discussion about North Korea policy in the West. He elaborated on it several times. But he also made clear that he did not expect immediate results.
"As we stick to this tolerance on our part, with such a flexible approach, then perhaps not in the near term but in the long run we'll be able to see changes in North Korea's attitude," Mr. Kim said.
To be sure, any progress in relations between the West and North Korea is likely to be measured. Many American officials perceive North Korea as a dinosaur, and a malevolent one at that. And companies are not exactly jostling one another to invest in one of the last Communist countries, particularly one that refuses entry to most Americans.
Still, the American Government has been torn in recent years about what to do with North Korea. Particularly since 1994, when the United States and North Korea agreed to improve ties as part of a pact to end the North's suspected nuclear weapons program, some American officials -- most notably James Laney, a former American Ambassador to South Korea -- have argued for a policy of greater engagement with the North. While keeping some sanctions, the United States has contributed emergency food aid to the North and has expressed its readiness to exchange liaison offices whenever the North wants.
Mr. Kim's ideas carry special force because he is not only his country's President, but also an emerging leader for Asia as a whole, a longtime campaigner for democracy who has for decades written widely about international issues. Korean officials and Western diplomats alike said the visit to the United States was not expected to result in landmark new agreements, but rather to affirm a strong relationship and to give Mr. Kim a chance to try to rebuild international confidence in the tattered Korean economy.
The American Ambassador here, Stephen Bosworth, said, "It's an opportunity for him and for us to publicly show support for his efforts to bring Korea out of this morass, to solidify the security relationship and to commend Kim Dae Jung for embracing democracy and making the tough choices to repair the economy."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
U.S. Not Surprised
 WASHINGTON, June 1 (By The New York Times) -- A Clinton Administration official, insisting on anonymity, said this evening that Mr. Kim's remarks were not a surprise, because he had hinted at a softening in his stance in recent remarks to South Korean journalists.
President Clinton's reaction, delivered by his spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, was low key and cautious. "We look forward to President Kim's first visit since his election," Mr. McCurry said today, adding that it would provide "an opportunity to continue our close consultations and exchange of views on how best to promote peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Economy Fades as Big Issue In Newly Surging California

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 1

 BODY:
The most striking thing about the primary election campaigns here, from the candidates' debate to the deluge of 30-second television commercials and the speeches on the stump, was that the topic that dominated California politics for years rarely surfaced: the economy.
While Californians are savoring economic good times, the adjustment has been troublesome for many politicians who are struggling for something to talk about in the absence of ready-made, bread-and-butter issues that touch the lives of voters. The challenge for candidates, here and around the country, is to adjust to an electorate that has been remarkably transformed and has become unusually sedate. 
 Whatever the outcome in this state's primary on Tuesday, the campaign here offers the first big snapshot of how candidates everywhere are trying to navigate the politics of prosperity. With pocketbook appeals largely off the table, the issue of education -- which was entirely neglected four years ago -- came to the fore, not only in a ballot initiative that would essentially eliminate bilingual education, but also in a broader debate over how to improve California's public schools. Other close-to-home issues are also bubbling, like growth management and cutting the state's vehicle licensing tax. And the void is also being filled by personal attacks.
"It's a world of difference in terms of voter attitudes this year," said Mark Baldassare, senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. In the San Francisco area, for instance, Mr. Baldassare said his polling shows that voters are "most satisfied" with their jobs and "most negative about traffic." But aggravating as it can be, traffic is hardly weighty enough to drive the elections in the most populous state in the nation.
With California's economy soaring -- and a state surplus projected at $4.4 billion -- the one time politicians sounded exercised about the subject was when they groused that unemployment was so low that there was a shortage of workers to collect signatures to put initiatives on the ballot.
"You're starting with an electorate here that isn't that interested in politics," said Dan Schnur, a Republican political analyst in San Francisco. "But when things are going so well, it's even harder to get them to engage. We have a candidate for attorney general who, out of desperation, declared that one of her top priorities if elected is dealing with road rage."
It is not that candidates did not try to campaign on the economy. But somehow, sparring over how best to spend a surplus, or how to grapple with worker shortages, did not make for as compelling a debate as campaigns past that featured bleak commercials of closed factory gates and long unemployment lines.
This is mostly good news for incumbents because challengers have had a particular problem in coming up with persuasive arguments to elect fresh leadership at a time when things are going so well. But even for incumbents, the lack of economic turbulence has led them searching for other, equally powerful messages to connect with voters. And many have found themselves dwelling more on the prosperous present rather than making a vigorous case for the future.
"For the first time in 30 years, we passed a balanced budget with a heart," said Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat seeking re-election, at a luncheon in San Francisco. "We invested in the new economy, in high-tech and biotech. We've created 1,300,000 new good-paying jobs in California."
Building up to her case for re-election, Ms. Boxer declared: "America is back. California is back. And guess what? I want to go back to the Senate to make sure that America and California are the shining stars of the next century."
In the last major elections here, voters despaired about their lives and their jobs. Four years ago, it seemed, every other word out of the contenders' mouths was the economy and jobs (more accurately, joblessness). Everywhere she went, Kathleen Brown, the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for governor in 1994, who challenged the incumbent, Gov. Pete Wilson, vowed, "One million new jobs for California." The Democrats relentlessly mocked "Pete Wilson's economy."
Since then, 1.4 million jobs have been created in California. Now, according to polling by the Public Policy Institute of California, 6 of 10 voters in this state think the economy is in excellent or good shape, and many say their own finances have improved, and expect them to improve even more next year. The economic turnabout helps explain why Mr. Wilson's two-term tenure has barely been mentioned by Democrats during this campaign.
Some politicians, including Mr. Wilson, say voters have the luxury of thinking about the long term.
"In a time of prosperity, people can be concerned with other issues -- as now they are about education -- and rightly so," said Mr. Wilson, a Republican. "When the economy is not good people have that deep concern about their own economic well-being, and the incumbents can almost do no right.
"And the converse is true. When it is performing well and producing not just jobs but prosperity, their confidence returns as consumers and they are inclined to be highly tolerant of the incumbents. You saw that with Bush's defeat in '92 and with Clinton's re-election in '96. So one guy paid the penalty for a bad economy as an incumbent and the other guy enjoyed the benefits of a good one."
Because there is no longer a premium on candidates with economic know-how, the unflagging economy has posed a particular problem for two wealthy candidates here who have presented themselves as outsiders from the business world: Alfred A. Checchi, the former co-chairman of Northwest Airlines who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, and Darrell Issa, a car alarm entrepreneur who is seeking the Republican nomination to take on Senator Boxer.
But by a margin of 59 percent to 24 percent, Mr. Baldassare explained, prospective voters are more inclined to favor candidates with experience in elective office. It is a far cry from the Presidential campaigns of Ross Perot, whose allure, besides bankrolling his own campaign, was his ability to appeal to voters as a no-nonsense business executive. It is also a far cry from the general, anti-incumbent mood that roiled the politics of 1992 and 1994, and produced an aversion to the status quo.
"Everything but the weather seems to be going well," said Steven A. Merksamer, a lawyer in Sacramento who is active in Republican politics. "That's not to say we can't do better. But people are afraid of serious change by untested people."
Representative Jane Harman, a Democrat seeking the nomination for governor, said in an interview that she rejected the notion that the economy was no longer an issue. "This is the second act," she said, saying much more needed to be done to create jobs. In a campaign brochure, Ms. Harman declared, "Creating new, high-skill, high-wage jobs is one of California's greatest challenges."
Mr. Checchi was even more aggressive in appealing for change, and for pounding away at the income disparity between the rich and poor. "The real issue is, do you want more of the same?" he asked. "If so, then for God's sake, don't vote for me."
If the polls are accurate, voters are heeding Mr. Checchi's advice and favoring another Democrat who is known as a solid, if not dynamic, Sacramento insider: Lieut. Gov. Gray Davis.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Davis 'Not Morally Fit'
 SACRAMENTO, Calif., June 1 (Reuters) -- Governor Wilson today said Lieutenant Governor Davis, was "not morally fit" to hold office.
Mr. Wilson, who, by law, cannot seek a third term, demanded that Mr. Davis retract comments made at a campaign stop in Los Angeles on Sunday in which he said, "We all have our dark side, and Wilson likes to fan the flames of discontent, anti-Semitism and bigotry."
In a statement today, Mr. Wilson said: "When someone seeks to engage in race-baiting for political gain, and makes false charges of racism and anti-Semitism, that's beneath contempt. And anyone guilty of it is not morally fit to hold office."
Mr. Davis was reported to have said he misspoke and would send Mr. Wilson a letter of explanation.

Ferry Company Will Get Funds for New Terminal

DATELINE: WEEHAWKEN

 BODY:
Under an economic incentive package announced yesterday, New York Waterway, a private company that runs ferries to Manhattan, will receive a $12 million Federal grant and $11 million in low-cost loans from New Jersey and Hudson County to build a ferry terminal linked to a light rail station along the Hudson River in Weehawken.
New York Waterway will use the money to replace its existing terminal -- a modified ferry -- with a new structure on a nearby cove, said Pat Smith, a spokesman for the company. The new terminal, with four slips, will be linked by a walkway to a stop along a stretch of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail Line from Hoboken to Ridgefield Park, which the state expects to be completed in 2001. The new ferry terminal should be finished sometime before that, Mr. Smith said. 
 The grant is part of an appropriations bill expected to be signed by President Clinton this week, said Hal Connolly, a spokesman for Representative Robert Menendez, a Democrat who represents the area. He said the project will help reduce traffic congestion by encouraging use of mass transit.

But the 928 units that received permits in April represented a 24.2 percent increase over the 747 units permitted in March. For the year so far, permits for 3,059 units have been issued, an increase of 5.7 percent over the 2,894 units permitted at this time last year. 
 The year increase indicates that long-term growth in housing is being sustained, said James F. Abromaitis, commissioner of the agency. In April, Hartford County logged the most new units, at 206, followed by 197 in New Haven County and 193 in Fairfield County. The state said 92 new units received permits in April in New London County, 75 in Middlesex County, 74 in Litchfield County, 54 in Tolland County and 37 in Windham County.
Leading the state in the percentage increase in new unit permits from March to April were communities in Windham County, with a 54.2 percent increase over the month, and Middlesex County, with a 47.1 percent increase.

HEADLINE: D'Amato Campaign Fund Awash In Donations by Hopeful Lobbies

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
The amendment was brief, so it attracted scant notice when Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato helped tuck it into a bill he was shepherding through the Senate as chairman of the Banking Committee. But the provision, which weakened a consumer protection statute governing the real estate industry, was decidedly important to one company.
Mr. D'Amato agreed to support the provision in late 1995 after lobbying by the MBNA Corporation, one of the nation's biggest issuers of credit cards. The company is also one of the Senator's biggest benefactors, having channeled more than $500,000 in recent years to campaign committees that he leads. 
 Throughout his career, Mr. D'Amato has been a tireless fund-raiser, a politician who works the phones with a barker's gusto. Yet since taking over the Banking Committee in 1995, he has made his previous fund-raising seem almost pedestrian, harvesting millions of dollars from individuals and companies in the financial industry that, like MBNA, have a stake in legislation that he can control with a pen stroke.
The money has not just filled Mr. D'Amato's Senate campaign account, which is larger than that of any other Senate candidate in the nation. It has also enriched the New York Republican State Committee, strengthening the Senator's formidable political network and reinforcing his status as the state's dominant Republican.
In MBNA's case, Mr. D'Amato has unsuccessfully supported the company's efforts to revamp the consumer protection statute, which in most instances bars mortgage providers from paying fees to get referrals. MBNA says the statute is hindering its expansion in the mortgage business, while consumer groups say lifting the ban would drive up the cost of buying a home.
But MBNA is not the only financial behemoth that has given heavily to Mr. D'Amato. Others -- including Travelers Group; Bear, Stearns & Company; Goldman, Sachs & Company and the Beneficial Corporation -- have also directed the kind of large sums to Mr. D'Amato's campaign committees that were once the sole province of the national parties. Some have held private fund-raisers for Mr. D'Amato.
"That facilitated entree to the Senator," said Dave H. Williams, chairman of Alliance Capital Management, referring to contributions to Mr. D'Amato's committees.
Alliance, a money management firm in New York City, held a fund-raiser for the Senator last year as he was successfully sponsoring a proposal providing for a tax break that the firm wanted.
With the money from Wall Street and other financial companies fattening his Senate campaign account, Mr. D'Amato has raised more than $17 million as he tries to overcome a strong Democratic challenge and win a fourth term. He has nearly $11 million in the bank.
 
Only Schumer Comes Close
The only other Congressional candidate in the nation who has come close is a Democrat who wants his job, Representative Charles E. Schumer. Mr. Schumer serves on the House Banking Committee and has also benefited from Wall Street's generosity. He has raised more than $10 million.
For members of Congress, there is nothing unusual about reeling in contributions from interests they oversee. It is illegal only if there is an agreement to exchange contributions for official actions.
Mr. D'Amato faced ethics inquiries over his ties to donors earlier in his career, but no serious wrongdoing was found. He has not come under official scrutiny since he became chairman of the panel -- known as the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs -- that covers a broad swath of the nation's economy, from banking and securities regulations to export controls to urban mass transit.
But some campaign finance experts say Mr. D'Amato has demonstrated a pattern of seeking money from companies with interest in Banking Committee business, knowing donors are unlikely to ignore the requests of a powerful legislator. They contend that Mr. D'Amato has used the Republican State Committee to accept big donations from the financial industry because the state committee's accounts are subject to little regulation.
Mr. D'Amato declined to be interviewed about his fund-raising. His aides said he had become the biggest fund-raiser in Congress because donors were pleased by his stewardship of the Banking Committee and his overall record.
"The Senator is recognized as the most effective legislative voice in New York State because he gets things done for the people," said Lisette McSoud Mondello, a spokeswoman for Mr. D'Amato. "Clearly, the people who contribute to Senator D'Amato support the principles of the Senator, not the other way around."
In recent years, Mr. D'Amato has been in a prime position to collect donations because the financial industry has been undergoing rapid changes, with some companies seeking overhaul of decades-old regulations and others lobbying to keep them in place.
Mr. D'Amato recently scheduled hearings on long-stalled legislation that would do away with Depression-era regulations that have stymied many mergers between banks, securities firms and insurance companies.
The Senator called for the hearings after meeting with three prominent Wall Street executives, including Sanford I. Weill, chairman of the Travelers Group, which would have great difficulty completing its huge merger with Citicorp if such legislation were not approved. Travelers and its subsidiaries have given more than $375,000 to committees controlled by Mr. D'Amato in recent years, including $190,000 to the New York Republican State Committee.
"There is no doubt that Senator D'Amato has capitalized on his very powerful position to raise money from very wealthy sources," said Jennifer Shecter, a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group in Washington that monitors campaign finances. "The bottom line is that Al D'Amato is in the catbird seat when it comes to fund-raising. The special interests who care about legislation that comes before his committee are usually the ones with the most giving power."
Mr. D'Amato has also received large contributions from donors with interest in legislation before another powerful panel on which he sits, the Finance Committee, which oversees most tax and health-care policy.
Last year, he successfully pushed a proposal through the Finance Committee that granted a tax break to a group of limited partnerships. Mr. D'Amato's campaign committees have received more than $200,000 within the last five years from donors connected to the limited partnerships, records show.
One of those firms, Alliance Capital Management, raised more than $40,000 for the Senator, both through a fund-raiser and donations from the firm's executives, while it was seeking the tax break.
Mr. Williams, the firm's chairman, has contributed $63,000 to the Republican State Committee in the last two years, including $13,000 as he was lobbying Mr. D'Amato on the tax break. Alliance's parent, the Equitable Companies, gave $6,000 to the state party at the time of the lobbying, and an additional $25,000 later in 1997, records show.
Asked about a connection between the donations and the legislation, Ms. Mondello, Mr. D'Amato's spokeswoman, said, "That's just nonsense."
"Senator D'Amato is always fighting for New Yorkers and New York companies," she said.
It is Mr. D'Amato's position on the Banking Committee, though, that is perhaps his most potent lure as a fund-raiser. Most of the Senate bills of interest to MBNA go before the Banking Committee, according to lobbying records.
Over the last four years, Mr. D'Amato's Senate campaign has received more than $220,000 from MBNA's political action committee, its executives and the executives' family members, according to disclosure records. The donations from the executives and their families came after MBNA ran a fund-raising drive for Mr. D'Amato, sending memos throughout the company asking for contributions.
MBNA, which is based in Wilmington, Del., has given $170,000 to the New York Republican State Committee. The company and its political action committee gave $127,500 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee when Mr. D'Amato was its chairman in 1995 and 1996. MBNA's donations to this committee dropped sharply after another Senator became its chairman in 1997, records show.
 
'We Support Good Government'
Finally, the company gave $5,000 more to a state political action committee controlled by the Senator.
In response to questions about the donations, David Spartin, an MBNA vice chairman, said: "There is no connection between any campaign contributions and any piece of legislation. We support good government."
The relationship goes beyond Senate business. Last year, Mr. D'Amato attended a ceremony at Columbia University honoring the company's chairman, Alfred Lerner, where the Senator made remarks praising Mr. Lerner.
The mortgage law that MBNA has sought to revise generally bans mortgage providers from paying fees to real estate agents for referring business to them.
Mr. D'Amato said at a hearing last year that the law had "restricted the growth of the new marketing systems for mortgage products." He said scaling back the law could reduce the cost of mortgages "and help make the dream of home ownership available to more Americans."
Consumer groups fear that if mortgage companies are allowed to pay fees for referrals, it could lead to customers' being steered to more expensive mortgage products.
MBNA wants an amendment to the law that would allow it to pay fees to so-called affinity groups -- like alumni associations -- for referrals. MBNA has specialized in issuing credit cards through affinity groups, and it wants to use those relations to expand its mortgage business.
MBNA first obtained the support of two Republicans on the Banking Committee who were sponsoring a bill to scale back some banking regulations. But the crucial backing came from Mr. D'Amato, who was a co-sponsor of the bill and as chairman can control amendments to it. Another major credit card company that was also lobbying for the measure, Household International, has given more than $100,000 to Mr. D'Amato's committees.
In late 1996, the provision came under attack from consumer groups, Democratic Senators and the White House. Other mortgage providers joined them, saying that while the statute needed to be revamped, the amendment was biased toward credit card companies.
Several lobbyists and Senate staff members who worked on the legislation recalled that Mr. D'Amato fought fiercely for the provision. "Senator D'Amato was really the force behind it," said one lobbyist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
But faced with opposition from the White House, Mr. D'Amato and the other Republican Senators dropped the provision.
"D'Amato's people really held out for a long time" in the negotiations, said another person who worked on the legislation.
Ms. Mondello denied the contention that Mr. D'Amato was a staunch backer of the provision.
"He supported it, but never fought for it," she said.
A new version of the provision is in a bill that is now before the Banking Committee and is being co-sponsored by Mr. D'Amato.

HEADLINE: Chinese Men Are Queried In Jersey Shore Smuggling

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS 

 BODY:
As the authorities searched for the captain of a smuggling boat that ran aground on Saturday night in New Jersey, investigators yesterday began to interview its 22 Chinese passengers in the hope of learning who organized and profited from their flight.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service released little information about the detainees yesterday, other than that they came from Fujian Province, the starting point for many of the illegal Chinese immigrants who have made the tortuous journey to American shores in recent years. 
 Officials said that investigators were still conducting separate interviews of the 22 men, the youngest of them 18 and the oldest 45.
The men were being held at the I.N.S. detention center in Elizabeth, N.J., where they will appear before immigration judges later this week and be charged with illegal entry into the United States. At that point, usually the beginning of a long and complicated legal battle, they may ask for political asylum.
Speaking at a news conference in Washington, the I.N.S. Commissioner, Doris Meissner, said the facts that were known about the men's journey, although sketchy, fit into a pattern seen in other immigrant-smuggling cases.
"At this point we would operate on the supposition that they are connected to an organized-crime organization of some kind," she said, calling the Chinese smuggling business particularly odious because it funnels hapless immigrants into sweatshop jobs where they are abused, exploited and overworked.
"This is a multibillion-dollar criminal enterprise played out on a global scale," Mrs. Meissner said.
Investigators were still searching for the captain and presumed owner of the boat, who slipped through police hands before anyone realized that the abandoned craft had unloaded a human cargo of illegal immigrants. He was identified by the authorities as a Korean-American, Jason Choi, 38, of Flushing, Queens.
His 30-foot fiberglass pleasure boat, the Oops II, ran aground at the end of Mount Street in Bay Head, one of the wealthiest towns on the Jersey Shore, and for the first three hours, the police treated the incident as little more than a case of a captain who had foundered in heavy fog and purposely beached his craft.
When he was questioned by state troopers at a phone booth near the boat, Mr. Choi identified himself as the owner and said he had lost his way while fishing and ran the boat up on the beach because he was running out of fuel.
John Hagerty, a spokesman for the state police, said that the registration documents for the boat were in order and that a check found no outstanding warrants for Mr. Choi. Troopers even gave Mr. Choi a ride into downtown Point Pleasant.
When reports began to come in about Chinese men wandering around the town, the local police called the troopers again.
The aborted ride in the Oops II was probably the final leg of an arduous journey from China. Typically, smuggling rings bring Asian immigrants across Eastern Europe or southern Africa, then to South America, before heading up through the Caribbean or Central America to Mexico.
The boat itself offered few clues -- some blankets, water bottles and a few cans of a nutrient supplement -- to the conditions or duration of the final leg of the immigrants' journey, Bay Head's Police Chief, William Dikun, said.
It was still unclear whether the 22 men, like so many before them, were destined to work off much of the $25,000 to $30,000 in smuggling fees in the sweatshops of New York City.
While many Fujian immigrants have risen to positions of political and economic power in the Chinese-American community in New York, the province, a hodgepodge mix of booming businesses and impoverished rural farms, also supplies the bulk of the underpaid and undocumented sweatshop work force.
"It's pretty common these days to go into one sweatshop or another," said Wang Lim, executive director of the Chinese Staff and Workers Association, which is based in New York and represents Chinese laborers.
"After the liberalization of the Chinese economy and the coming of foreign investment, many of the Fujian villagers pushed into the cities and others were pushed out and went overseas," Wang Lim said. "The sweatshops like to employ these people, taking advantage of the fact that they are poor and don't have documents."
To help choke off the smuggling pipelines that bring in Asian and other illegal immigrants, the I.N.S. has opened 13 new offices around the world in the last three years to intercept immigrants before they reach the United States.

HEADLINE: Sales of Chrysler Vehicles Jumped 27% in May to a Record

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: AUBURN HILLS, Mich., June 2

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation said today that sales of its cars and trucks in the United States rose 27 percent in May, making it the best sales month ever for the No. 3 auto maker.
Chrysler's car sales rose 4.7 percent, to 73,452 vehicles, from May 1997. Truck sales rose 39 percent, to 176,579, a percentage increase magnified because of a United Automobile Workers strike at an important truck-engine plant last year. The total, 250,031 vehicles, beat the previous record of 245,289 in May 1996. 
 The Honda Motor Company and the Toyota Motor Corporation also posted gains in what is expected to be the industry's best month so far this year.
"These are phenomenal numbers," said Diane C. Swonk, an economist at the First Chicago NBD Corporation. A spate of mortgage refinancing earlier this year is giving consumers more cash to spend on cars, she added.
Chrysler, which agreed last month to be acquired by Daimler-Benz A.G., beat expectations of a 19 percent increase. Toyota also recorded its best sales month ever, rising 17 percent, to 136,274 vehicles. Honda sales rose 19 percent, to 92,641 cars and trucks, its second-best month.
The gains heightened expectations that May sales would be at least 15.7 million, up from 15.5 million in April and the highest since December, when reporting is completed Wednesday. Industry sales are expected to surge 7 percent in May, compared with May 1997.
The higher sales did not come cheaply, however. Auto makers spent an average $1,500 a vehicle on incentives in May, up 50 percent from the corresponding period a year earlier, analysts said.
There are signs that sales may slow in the second half of the year, in part because four years of strong sales has left little pent-up demand. Sales in 1998 are expected to be just below last year's 15.2 million.
"The economy will still be good; incentives will still be out there," said David Littmann, senior economist at Comerica Inc., who added that the economy would slow down.
Ms. Swonk agreed. "It's hard to believe these rates are sustainable," she said.
The National Association of Purchasing Management's index, a closely watched gauge of United States manufacturing activity, declined last month. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said a build-up in business inventories suggested second-quarter United States economic growth below the first quarter's 4.8 percent rate.
That is tempered by rises in personal income and spending increases in April. The Labor Department is expected to report May's unemployment rate Friday; in April, the rate set a 28-year low of 4.3 percent.
Each Chrysler sport utility vehicle, mini-van and pickup truck model increased sales. Dodge Caravan, the company's most popular mini-van, rose 19 percent, while the Ram pickup was up 39 percent.
Chrysler Concorde sales rose 78 percent, to 7,205, while Intrepid sales fell 31 percent, to 8,263 cars. Chrysler discounted leases on the Intrepid to as little as $289 a month.
Toyota was helped by a 25 percent increase in Camry sales, the midsize car's first increase since December. The compact Corolla's sales rose 22 percent. Honda Accord sales climbed 35 percent, while Civic sales increased 18 percent.
The Ford Motor Company is expected to post unchanged May sales on Wednesday. The General Motors Corporation is expected to report an increase of 10 percent from a strike-weakened comparison a year earlier.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Blue-Chip Issues in Retreat, With Dow Declining 31.13

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks ended mixed yesterday, as blue chips slipped and technology issues rebounded from Monday's slide.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.13 points, or four-tenths of 1 percent, to 8,891.24. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.24, or two-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,093.22, and the Nasdaq composite index climbed 14.97, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,761.79.
"You've got an incredible tug-of-war going on," said James Weiss, deputy chief investment officer for stocks at State Street Research and Management in Boston, which oversees $51 billion. "We've had an incredible upsurge in the market, and that has collided with a period of high uncertainty about where the economy" and earnings are headed, he said. Since the end of the first quarter, market indexes have been little changed as traders and investors debate how much Asia's slowing economies and weak currencies will cut United States corporate profits.
The debate makes for intraday swings like yesterday's, when the Dow rose 54 points in early trading, slipped 40 points, recovered to a gain of about 20 points and then tumbled to a loss of 31. Much of the movement yesterday was driven by computer-guided buy and sell orders, according to Birnyi Associates, a Greenwich, Conn., research firm.
The concern about corporate profits is countered by low interest rates, the flow of money into the market from individual investors in the United States and overseas investors seeking a haven from the slumping economies of Asia, traders say.
After returning 17 percent in the first quarter, the Nasdaq is down 8.8 percent from its April 22 high. That is close to the 10 percent loss that most analysts call a correction in a bull market.
The Dow industrials, by contrast, returned 17 percent through May 13, when it hit its recent high of 9,211, and since then is down only 3.4 percent. That 17 percent gain is more than most investors thought they would see for the entire year.
"We have had a correction, except in the Dow stocks, and what we need is to have a correction in some of those big ones," said Edward Collins, head of United States equity trading at Daiwa Securities Inc. in New York. "The problem is you have the money flow continuing into the mutual funds and you have foreign investors fearful of the foreign markets; that's what's creating the upward pressure on some of these big stocks."
Among individual issues yesterday, computer-related stocks surged, a day after the slide in Asian markets and Intel's delay of a new microprocessor sent them tumbling.
Dell Computer jumped 4 5/16, to 82 5/8, after dropping 5 percent on Monday, and Intel rose 1 1/4, to 69 1/4, recouping some of Monday's 4.8 percent slide. The Oracle Corporation gained 1 9/16, to 24 3/8 and the Microsoft Corporation jumped 1 3/4, to 85 1/2.
Boeing fell 1 3/4, to 45 7/8, leading the Dow's late decline, after losing an attempt to limit potential legal damages to the economic loss resulting from the deaths of the 230 people aboard T.W.A. Flight 800.
General Motors rose 1 7/8, to 73, the biggest gainer in the Dow industrials, and the Ford Motor Company jumped 4 1/8, to 57, as investors bought before the companies report May sales results today. Chrysler, which today reported a 27 percent sales increase over May 1997, gained 1/8, to 56.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Edge Lower As Home Sales Show Strength

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices slipped yesterday for the first time in four sessions amid signs that the economy was still growing at a brisk clip. Prices were also held down by the prospects of more corporate and Government agency debt coming to market.
A softer dollar and stabilizing stock markets in Asia added to the downward pressure on bond prices. 
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 7/32, to 104 23/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.79 percent, from 5.77 percent on Monday.
Prices were hurt by a report that sales of new single-family homes jumped 5.2 percent in April, to an annual rate of 888,000 units.
"The market was disappointed but not devastated by the stronger-than-expected home sales data, primarily because the gains were lopsided, with all areas except the South registering declines," said Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio.
Also, some of the flight-to-safety effects of the Asian financial crisis quickly dissipated after investors heard the comments of Robert T. Parry, the president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, who seemed to be playing down the long-term effects of the Asian crisis.
Mr. Chan said the comments that Mr. Parry made at a conference in Idaho raised suspicion among investors that Mr. Parry did not think the Asian crisis would prevent the Fed from raising rates if inflationary pressures became apparent.
Investors are looking cautiously ahead of this Friday's release of the Government report on employment in May. Although some bullish investors say the jobs report will show only moderate growth, they are still somewhat nervous.
Competing supply is also a worry for the Treasury market, as traders brace for up to $15 billion of corporate and agency debt.
Yesterday the Treasury sold $15 billion of 12-day cash-management bills at an average rate of 5.30 percent. Cash-management bills are used to meet the Treasury's short-term cash needs, in addition to its regular schedule of debt sales.
Following are the results of the auction of 12-day cash-management bills:

HEADLINE: April Sales Of New Homes Set a Record

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
Sales of new single-family homes rose to a record level in April and the United States index of leading economic indicators increased for the fourth consecutive month, signs that the economy will keep growing in the months ahead.
"This is just a very strong economy," said Ian J. McCarthy, president and chief executive of Beazer Homes USA, an Atlanta-based home builder. "We have good confidence and low interest rates -- a good combination for home building." 
 New-home sales climbed 5.2 percent in April to an annual rate of 888,000 units, after a revised 4.2 percent decline in March, the Commerce Department reported today. Booming sales in the South were enough to offset declines in other parts of the country.
In a separate report issued today, the Conference Board, a private research group, said that its index of leading economic indicators rose one-tenth of a percent in April. The index, intended to project economic activity over the next half-year, has not declined since April 1997.
The housing gains are helping to temper the effects of a slowdown in manufacturing, analysts said. And while the economy probably will not expand in the second quarter as fast as the 4.8 percent annual pace of the first quarter, the cooling of growth may keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates for the rest of the year, said Mark Vitner, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.
"With the big run-up in inventories and the huge surge in imports we saw in the first quarter, we're going to see manufacturing activity slow a bit," Mr. Vitner said. "That's the part of the economy the Fed's focusing on."
Private forecasts that United States growth will slow this year by a half to a full percentage point because of Asia are reasonable, the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank president, Robert Parry, said in a speech in Idaho today. "Still, the effects of Asia's economic crisis on United States growth so far have been less than expected," he said.
The housing report showed that April marked the eighth consecutive month the pace of new-home sales was above 800,000 units, the longest stretch since the series began in 1963.
"Given that existing-home sales have been in record territory for some time, strong new sales should not come as a surprise," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at HSBC Securities Inc. in New York. "With mortgage rates unlikely to rise for the foreseeable future, the strength in housing activity is unlikely to subside this year."
The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 7.15 percent in April, up slightly from 7.13 percent in March. Rates have recently fluctuated around 7 percent.
New-home sales rose 18.1 percent in the South to an annual rate of 418,000 units. In contrast, sales in the Midwest fell 9.2 percent, to 157,000 units at an annual rate; sales dropped 3.1 percent in the Northeast to 95,000 units, and dipped 0.5 percent in the West to 218,000 units.

HEADLINE: Russian Bond Auction: A $1.2 Billion Balancing Act

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
Raising the money that it needs each week to pay off debt that is coming due and finance its persistent budget deficit has always been a tricky proposition for Russia, given its tumultuous political and economic climate.
But the job will be particularly difficult on Wednesday, when the Government needs to raise $1.2 billion from the financial markets in the face of near panic among domestic and foreign investors about Russia's ability to maintain the value of its currency and honor all its debts. 
 The Government has failed in three previous weekly debt auctions to raise all the cash that it needs. Economists said it remained unclear whether this auction would fare better.
Although sky-high interest rates and a possibility of additional aid from the International Monetary Fund have somewhat reassured investors, economists and market analysts said Russia might once again be able to sell only part of the bonds.
That would force the Government to dip into its skimpy reserves to pay creditors, deepening the sense of crisis.
The Government has been pressing domestic banks and investors to buy the bonds as a sign of confidence in Russia's prospects. There were some reports today that domestic investors, who are required to place money in escrow with the Government the day before an auction if they want a chance to bid, had made bigger-than-expected deposits, suggesting that demand for the bonds could be better than expected. But analysts said that with the situation so unsettled it was difficult to predict any quick end to the turbulence, especially if foreigners remain wary.
"It's going to be another volatile day," a Russia specialist at Merrill Lynch in London, Dmitry Chernyak, said. "I don't see a lot of foreign investors returning to the market at this point."
Russia's main vehicle for raising money on its domestic financial markets is a bond known as a GKO that matures in less than a year. The country has $60 billion in GKO's outstanding, and because of their relatively short durations the Government is forced into a weekly scramble to redeem them and refinance the debt. Investors demand short maturities to minimize the risks of the ruble's being sharply devalued, eroding the return on the bonds.
By most estimates up to one-third of the GKO's are held by foreigners, with Russian banks holding most of the rest. The crisis in Asia had made foreigners skittish about investing in developing economies even before Russia's latest woes erupted. And since the Russian stock market began falling and the currency started coming under pressure, foreigners have been pulling their money out of Russia.
To make ruble-denominated investments more attractive and prop up the currency's value, the Russian central bank has pushed up the short-term annualized interest rates it controls, to 150 percent. The tactic has so far succeeded in maintaining the ruble's value.
But between the Government-controlled interest rates and the rates set by the market -- including those on the GKO bonds, which are around 65 percent on a yearly basis -- Russia's interest costs threaten to soar out of control. Nearly one-third of the Government's expenditures this year are projected to go to making interest payments. The comparable figure in the United States is 14 percent.
The projection is based on an assumption that the annualized GKO rates will decline, to 35 percent, economists said.
"If interest rates remain high, it exacerbates the budget problem and puts them, in effect, in a debt trap," said Desmond Lachman, head of emerging market economic research at Salomon Smith Barney, the investment firm in New York. "It's imperative that they get interest rates down quickly."
If rates remain at their current levels for the rest of the year, the budget deficit would be 8 percent of gross domestic product, compared with the 5 percent target agreed to last week by the International Monetary Fund and Prime Minister Sergei V. Kiriyenko, according to Erik F. Nielsen, an economist at Goldman Sachs in London.
Mr. Nielsen, who met on Monday with Mr. Kiriyenko in Moscow as part of a delegation of Western bankers, said Russia planned to try to lessen its dependence on the domestic GKO market by issuing additional bonds denominated in dollars and other currencies through financial markets in Europe. He said Russia was now hoping to raise up to $6 billion this year on the European markets, up from $3.5 billion under a previous plan.
Russia will need to finance the redemption of $50 billion in debt this year, Mr. Nielsen said.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "THE BOTTOM LINE -- The Burden of Debt"
Russia's revised budget, which was released last week, shows that about one-third of its spending covers interest payments on the debt. In the U.S., it is 14 percent.

HEADLINE: Pain Under Attack;
Explosion in Biotechnology Drugs Focuses on Arthritis

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
In the 20 years she has had rheumatoid arthritis, Veronica Lewandowski has undergone replacements of both hips, both knees and the knuckles of her right hand. She has tried virtually all the drugs available but nothing has really worked.
But in the eight months since Ms. Lewandowski, a 39-year-old resident of Worcester, Pa., began taking an experimental drug known as Enbrel, she is less fatigued and no longer has to descend stairs backward to spare her knees. And when her son fell off his bicycle recently, she astonished her two children, and herself, by running to him. 
 "They had never seen me run before," said Ms. Lewandowski, who had to give up her job in a chemical company laboratory because she could no longer operate the instruments. "Life is fun now."
Enbrel is the first drug produced by the two-decades-old biotechnology industry that is aimed at rheumatoid arthritis, which afflicts 2.5 million Americans and is the most severe of the diseases of the joints. What is more, other promising new drugs for rheumatoid arthritis are right behind it, a stark change for a disease for which there have been almost no new therapies for years.
"I've never seen this degree of activity in this field," said Dr. Michael E. Weinblatt, a professor at the Harvard Medical School. "I'm much more optimistic about controlling this disease than I was five years ago."
The new drugs are causing excitement on Wall Street as well as in the clinic because the potential market for them is estimated to be in the billions of dollars each year. The stock of the Immunex Corporation, the Seattle biotechnology company that makes Enbrel, nearly tripled in the last year, though it has recently fallen back to a level twice its 12-month low.
Two of the coming new drugs are involved in the big merger announced on Monday between the American Home Products Corporation and the Monsanto Company, promising to make the combined company a powerhouse in arthritis treatment. Immunex is 54 percent owned by American Home Products, which will help promote Enbrel in the United States and sell it overseas. Monsanto's pharmaceutical subsidiary, G. D. Searle & Company, is leading the way to develop a new type of painkiller for people with arthritis.
The new drugs appear to be as good or better than existing therapies but with fewer side effects. But they are not cures and just how much optimism is warranted will not be clear for some time.
Existing drugs can already control rheumatoid arthritis in 60 to 75 percent of the cases, especially if treatment is started early, said Dr. Doyt Conn, senior vice president for medical affairs at the Arthritis Foundation. He said the new drugs were likely to add to existing therapies, not replace them.
Immunex applied in May to the Food and Drug Administration for permission to market Enbrel. The company hopes for approval as early as the end of this year.
Centocor Inc. of Malvern, Pa., hopes to file for approval of a somewhat similar arthritis drug called Avakine within a year from now. But an F.D.A. advisory panel has just recommended approving Avakine for treatment of Crohn's disease, an intestinal inflammation. Once it is approved for that, doctors will also be able to legally use it for arthritis.
Also expected in 1999 are a new class of "super-aspirins" that treat pain and inflammation but without stomach bleeding and ulcers, which are estimated to cause several thousand deaths a year among patients who take existing painkillers.
Searle expects to file for F.D.A. approval in the third quarter of this year for use of such a drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and pain. Merck & Company is close behind, though it is first concentrating on osteoarthritis and pain.
Hoechst Marion Roussel, an American unit of Germany's Hoechst A.G., meanwhile, recently applied for approval to market still another new arthritis drug, called Arava.
Meirav Chovav, biotechnology analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said that Enbrel "could be a billion-dollar drug five years out." Sales projections from various analysts are even greater -- $2 billion or more -- for the super-aspirins.
The new drugs have their limitations. The super-aspirins, known as COX-2 inhibitors, do not even claim to halt the progress of the disease; instead, they are meant to relieve just the symptoms. Enbrel, Avakine and Arava probably will slow the destruction of joints but might not halt it completely, and they will not be able to heal already damaged bone and cartilage. Moreover, patients will probably have to take these drugs for life, possibly along with existing medications. But the new drugs, if started early enough, may allow sufferers to lead nearly normal lives.
"You can make it as controllable and tolerable as insulin-dependent diabetes or hypertension, where you have to take your medication but life goes on," said Elizabeth A. Tindall, clinical associate professor of medicine at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland. "That's a lot better than 'Buy your wheelchair now.' "
There are numerous types of arthritis, the most widespread being osteoarthritis, a wearing away of the cartilage that is associated with aging that affects about 20.7 million Americans, according to the Arthritis Foundation. But rheumatoid arthritis is the most debilitating. Half the victims -- many are women aged 25 to 50 -- must quit work because of disability within a decade, Dr. Weinblatt of Harvard said.
Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease, one in which the body's immune system, designed to fight bacteria and viruses, mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues, in this case the lining of the joints.
Until now, drugs for rheumatoid arthritis have been borrowed from other diseases like cancer or malaria. They either suppress the immune system in general or work in other ways not fully understood. And they can have serious side effects. The most commonly used is methotrexate, a generic cancer drug, which can cause liver and lung problems in a small number of patients.
There are also two dozen or so nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which range from over-the-counter aspirin and ibuprofen to more potent formulations sold by prescription.
The newer drugs take advantage of the explosion of knowledge about the immune system. They are designed to be more specific in their activities, with the hope of producing better results with fewer side effects. "We are on the threshold of targeted approaches," said Dr. Conn of the Arthritis Foundation.
Consider the COX-2 inhibitors. COX, which stands for cyclo-oxygenase, is an enzyme involved in causing pain and swelling at injury sites. But one type of COX is also involved in protecting the stomach lining and in helping the kidneys function.
Existing nonsteroidal painkillers like ibuprofen inhibit both types of COX. COX-2 drugs block the action of the enzyme involved in inflammation but leave the type that protects the stomach intact.
Dr. Michelle Petri, who heads the F.D.A.'s arthritis advisory committee, said that Searle's data show its COX-2 inhibitor to be as effective as existing painkillers yet "the toxicity profile was the same as for people taking the placebo." But she said the committee still asked for more data, in part to make sure there are no effects on fertility, as an animal study suggested there might be.
The existing market for prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis is $2 billion in the United States and as much as $5 billion worldwide, said Dr. Philip Needleman, president of Searle. "We think COX-2 inhibitors will take over that entire market," he said.
Immunex's Enbrel works by stopping the activity of tumor necrosis factor, or T.N.F., one of the major substances involved in mounting an immune attack. T.N.F. attaches to certain immune system cells at docking stations known as receptors. Enbrel consists of versions of this receptor that float in the bloodstream and act as decoys, getting the T.N.F. to bind with them rather than with the immune cells.
Immunex at first is aiming at patients for whom existing drugs have failed. In clinical trials, about 60 percent of such patients responded to Enbrel and 40 percent saw their condition improve substantially. Immunex has also shown that Enbrel together with methotrexate is better than methotrexate alone, said Peggy Phillips, senior vice president for pharmaceutical development.
But whether Enbrel will displace methotrexate is not clear because a direct comparison of the two drugs has not been completed. Moreover, a year's supply of Enbrel will cost between $5,000 and $10,000, Ms. Phillips said, and patients must inject themselves twice a week. Methotrexate is available in pills and a year's supply costs only about $1,000.
Competition could also come from Hoechst's new Arava, which will also be in pill form. Analysts consider it a conventional medicine rather than a biotechnology marvel, but it does work by a mechanism different from the existing drugs.
Another unknown is how effective and safe Enbrel will be over the long run, said Dr. James O'Dell, chief of rheumatology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Immunex's data extend only to 15 months.
Connie Johnson of Lake Oswego, Ore., began taking Enbrel in December 1996. "In the first year, I was literally cured, and it was astonishing," she said. But in the last few months, she said, some symptoms returned, though still nearly nowhere as bad as they were before.
Centocor's Avakine takes on T.N.F. not with a receptor but with a monoclonal antibody, a specially engineered version of the body's infection fighters.
For the most seriously ill patients who are not helped by any drugs, Cypress Bioscience of San Diego is applying this year for approval to market a device that filters antibodies from a person's blood.
Other companies -- including Amgen Inc., Autoimmune Inc., the Immune Response Company and Isis Pharmaceuticals -- are in clinical trials of drugs that work in various other ways. Some companies hope to stop the body from attacking itself to begin with. Anergen Inc., for instance, has reported some effectiveness in early clinical trials of an arthritis "vaccine."
But the immune system is complex and efforts to control it have had mixed results. Also, weakening the immune system can leave a patient more susceptible to infections. The Idec Pharmaceuticals Corporation and SmithKline Beecham P.L.C. last year suspended late-stage clinical trials on an Idec arthritis drug after some patients experienced declines in a key immune system cell. The companies have now started new trials with a reformulated drug.
Progress made in treating arthritis might also help in treating other diseases, particularly autoimmune ailments like lupus and Type 1 diabetes. Immunex is testing Enbrel for congestive heart failure and COX-2 inhibitors show promise in colon cancer.
In the long run, scientists hope to find the cause of the self-immune attack. The Arthritis Foundation is searching for the genes that make people susceptible to the disease. Because not all genetically predisposed people get the disease, scientists suspect there is some trigger, like a bacterium or virus, that sets it off. But that trigger, if it exists, has not been found.

HEADLINE: Canadian Colleges Look Across Border to Fill Their Classes (and Coffers)

BYLINE: By KALYANI VITTALA 

DATELINE: TORONTO, June 2

 BODY:
"You can study here and be home for supper," declared an advertisement for the University of Windsor published recently in The Detroit News.
But just in case that was not inducement enough, officials of the university -- in Windsor, Ontario, on the Detroit River opposite Detroit -- are lowering tuition for Americans beginning this fall. 
 "We think this is a tremendous deal for U.S. students," said Dr. Ross H. Paul, the university's president. "With this new tuition fee, we are offering young American men and women access to a solid education at a competitive price."
The price is $3,500 (United States) a year for American undergraduates, compared with about $6,500 for other foreign students and about $2,500 for Canadians. Information has been sent to more than 4,500 high school seniors in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, eliciting several hundred inquiries. With only 10 American undergraduates out of 10,000 at the University of Windsor this year, administrators are hoping for a windfall by the September application deadline for the coming school year.
"What struck me was the small number of American students we have enrolled here now," Dr. Paul said. "Crossing the border both ways is an everyday occurrence for many people."
The aggressive marketing strategy comes in the wake of deregulation of foreign student fees by the Ontario government, along with severe cuts in money from Ottawa over the last five years. The cutbacks have forced a more corporate mindset, with the United States seen as a largely untapped market.
About 3,000 Americans study in Canada every year, compared with 23,000 Canadians in the United States. "The deregulation of international fees has really changed the climate," said David A. Scott, senior adviser for government and community relations at the Council of Ontario Universities.
While recruiting foreign students is not a new idea, Mr. Scott said, the strategy is. "Business tactics become fuzzy when talking about academic institutions," he added.
Other universities are also looking to the United States to increase their visibility, enrollment and income. In 1996 the University of Toronto teamed with McGill University in Montreal and Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, for a 15-city marketing tour of the United States, visiting high schools and college fairs.
"It's simple economics," said Paul R. Beel, McGill's recruitment activities officer. "There is great opportunity for American students to come up to Canada. Our dollar makes it a lot less expensive, plus they can study in a foreign country without facing cultural shock."
Applications from American students were up by 30 percent this academic year. McGill now has the highest number of American students of any university in Canada -- 1,500, or 15 percent of students.
All three universities, among the most prestigious in the country, considered last year's marketing effort a success, and a similar endeavor is planned for this fall. But none intend to lower fees for non-Canadian students, though they are watching Windsor's experiment closely.
Some Canadian students are concerned about the shifting priorities. "This is nothing short of a cash-grab to make up for Federal Government cutbacks," said Brad Levigne, national chairman of the Canadian Federation of Students. "Part of the problem is that costs have become so prohibitive for southwestern Ontario residents that they have to turn to American students. They're just cash cows."
With government cutbacks of more than $7.5 billion for post-secondary education since the 1993-94 academic year, the proportion of a university's operating revenue financed through student fees has increased to 40 percent this year from 25 percent in 1992-93.
Tuition has always been regulated by Canada's provincial governments, largely because it has been so heavily subsidized by taxpayers. But two years ago the Ontario government deregulated foreign student tuition, allowing schools to set their own fees. It has just announced the deregulation of fees for graduate programs and professional colleges for the coming academic year.
While tuition for Canadian students has risen to $2,500 (United States) at most institutions from about $1,000 in 1991, fees for foreign students have remained stable at about $6,500 until Windsor's discount to Americans.
Dr. Paul, Windsor's president, is excited about the initiative, but he is not immune to a certain amount of hand-wringing over the changes that the university's decision signifies.
"We have to be really aware of the danger of focusing on the short term just to get bodies in here," Dr. Paul said. "If I denied there were strong market forces at work behind this decision, you wouldn't believe me. But we've watched the same thing happen in the United States and learned some lessons. When the arena gets more competitive you can over-subsidize students. You can almost buy them. But we know if we lose our academic integrity we are lost."
Tom Sees, assistant vice president of Wayne State University in Detroit, Windsor's closest competitor, says he does not feel territorial about a Canadian university dipping into the American student pool. Nonetheless, Wayne announced last month that it was lowering its tuition, to $2,500 from $7,000, for Canadians as well as for Ohio residents in four counties bordering Michigan. "We're looking at this as a sort of good neighbor policy," Mr. Sees said.
About 200 Canadian students attended Wayne this year.
"If you don't look at your students as consumers," Mr. Sees said, "you are not going to stay in business much longer."
This is exactly the kind of "Americanization" the students' federation fears. "With this market mentality, degrees will be devalued," Mr. Levigne said. "People should be concerned about the quality of their education, not what kind of bang they are getting for their buck."
David B. Young, president of the University of Windsor's Student Alliance, took a different approach.
"Any additional student we get is better than nothing," Mr. Young said. "It will help reduce the overhead, reduce the pressure for Canadian students' tuition to go up. And having more American students here will increase our cultural diversity. How can that not be a good thing?"

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Tells Businessmen To Help Out By Investing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 2

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin gathered the nation's most powerful businessmen at the Kremlin today and pressed them to use their money to help steady Russia's financial markets.
"When our own investors do not put their money in, foreigners leave," Mr. Yeltsin warned the businessmen. "If you want foreign investors to put their money in, you must put in yours." 
 Russia's central bank will hold a treasury bill auction on Wednesday. The sale of the bills has emerged as an important bellwether for the Government, which worries that the failure to sell all of the bills will further unnerve jittery investors.
The Kremlin went out of its way today to underscore Mr. Yeltsin's appeal, which was made in a closed-door meeting. It was made public by a Russian news service reporter who was allowed into part of the session.
At the meeting, Mr. Yeltsin listened to the businessmen's pleas for lower rail and energy tariffs. Some bankers also urged the Kremlin to threaten bankruptcy proceedings against deadbeat creditors.
As Russia's financial crisis simmers, Mr. Yeltsin is striving to assure foreign investors and skeptical voters that the economic situation is under control.
Enlisting the support of Russia's hard-hit but still powerful businessmen is the key. Dispelling the impression that Russia is run by a part-time President is also an important part of the Kremlin's public relations campaign.
Today's meeting began with bit of political theater. As the financiers assembled before a cordon of television cameras, Mr. Yeltsin turned to Anatoly B. Chubais, the former Kremlin aide he sent to Washington last week to appeal for additional international financing.
"Did my telephone calls help?" Mr. Yeltsin asked, referring to an earlier appeal to President Clinton. Mr. Chubais dutifully agreed that they did.
Adopting the mantle of a strong leader, Mr. Yeltsin also promised to present an "anti-crisis program" by the end of the month. The plan will be disclosed at an unusual meeting in the Kremlin's Marble Hall. Mr. Yeltsin summoned deputies from the upper and lower houses of Parliament to the session.
Still, obtaining Western aid is vital to restoring the confidence of investors, Russian officials say. And weeks of deliberations and negotiations appear to lie ahead.
The United States and other Western countries are trying to hammer out an aid plan, but they are moving at a deliberate pace. The proposals under consideration include an $8 billion to $10 billion reserve fund administered by the International Monetary Fund to help Russia's central bank buttress the ruble.
Western officials are also discussing other financial arrangements, including one that would help compensate the Russians for the toll that declining oil prices have taken on Russian exports. As part of the aid effort, future World Bank disbursement could be also be advanced.
Just as critical are the economic reforms the Russians will be asked to undertake in return. American officials have made it clear that the additional financing will be "conditional," a stipulation that appears intended to insulate the Clinton Administration from criticism that it is giving the Russians something for nothing.
Not all the clouds were dark today. The Yeltsin Government received a rare bit of good news when shares on the volatile Moscow stock exchange rose 12 percent. But brokers played down the significance, noting that trading was very light.
"It is going down on zero volume and going up on zero volume," said Tom Ashead, the co-director of research for United Financial Group. "The significance of this is that the market does not know what to do and where to go."
Mr. Yeltsin's meeting with the businessmen lasted for an hour and 40 minutes. It brought together 10 power brokers, including oil company executives, bankers and the heads of major financial industrial groups. The heads of some of the financial consortiums included Vladimir Potanin of Interros, Mikhail Fridman of Alfa Group and Mikhail Khodorkovsky of Rosprom.
The business barons have often fought among themselves as they jockeyed to control the spoils of the former Soviet state.
Mr. Fridman said in an interview that his bank was doing its share to invest in Russia: it bought $100 million of treasury bills last week just before the I.M.F. disclosed that it planned to disburse the next $670 million installment of its $10 billion loan.
Mr. Potanin said in an interview that Mr. Yeltsin underscored the need to work together to cope with financial crisis.
"He made the point that we are in the same boat and that we have to coordinate because of the very serious situation in the economy," Mr. Potanin said.

HEADLINE: Trump's Backers Trying to Sell First 2 Riverside Apartment Buildings

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
With Southeast Asia's real estate market in turmoil and New York's soaring, the Hong Kong investors who financed Donald Trump's Riverside South development in Manhattan are trying to sell the first two apartment buildings at the $2.5 billion project.
The New World Development Company, which led the consortium that bought the 75-acre waterfront parcel on the West Side of Manhattan in 1994, has hired Salomon Smith Barney to solicit bids for the two buildings. The consortium had hoped that construction would begin in 1995, but the project, which stretches between 59th and 72d Streets near the Hudson River, moved slowly and the first two apartment buildings are only now nearing completion. 
 Since then, interest rates in Hong Kong have climbed and real estate prices have plummeted as a recession rumbled through Southeast Asia. New World, unlike some other Hong Kong real estate companies, is not in danger of collapse, but with apartment rents and prices in Manhattan soaring, a sale in New York would allow the consortium to raise a pile of cash quickly. That money, in turn, could be used to finance the rest of the project.
Salomon Smith Barney has pitched the properties to the Resnick real estate family, the Related Companies, Vornado Realty Trust and several other real estate investment trusts, according to executives involved in the potential deal. The sale price could go as high as $350 million to $400 million, the executives said, but New World may still elect not to sell.
"New World is not under nearly the same pressure as some of the other real estate companies," said Jack A. Shaffer, managing director of international sales for the Sonnenblick-Goldman Company, a real estate investment bank. "But New World does need cash to do things here, particularly at the Riverside South project."
At the same time, Mr. Trump and the Hong Kong companies are continuing longstanding talks with CBS about selling a 10-acre parcel at the south end of Riverside South, near 59th Street, for $100 million. CBS would build a 1.5 million-square-foot television studio there, according to an executive who works with the Trump Organization. But the prospects of a deal are hobbled by a lengthy city review process, potential community opposition and CBS's interest in several other options.
The plans for Riverside South call for 5,700 apartments in 16 apartment buildings, 1.8 million square feet of commercial space and a 21.5-acre public park. Mr. Trump and his Hong Kong partners are just completing the first two buildings: a 40-story, 366-unit apartment house between 68th and 69th Streets and a 46-story tower between 69th and 70th Streets, with 440 condominiums, on what will be an extension of Riverside Drive. The condominium tower will probably be converted to a luxury rental building if it is bought by a real estate investment trust.
Mr. Trump has opened a rental office and is completing the condominium plan. Tenants, both retail and residential, are expected to be moving in by the end of the year.
New World has to decide whether to take its profits on the buildings through a sale or over time. For Mr. Trump, a sale might be a public relations setback, in that Riverside South would no longer be associated exclusively with his organization.
Whatever happens, the buildings should generate plenty of revenue. After taking a plunge in the early 1990's, the residential market has been white hot recently. In the last year alone, prices for apartments in Manhattan jumped 20.7 percent over all, and 40 percent on the west side, according to the Corcoran Group.
Two executives from different companies who talked with Salomon Smith Barney said that New World, rather than Mr. Trump, had initiated the process and "was calling the shots" on the potential deal.
Mr. Trump confirmed that the partners were exploring a sale, though he doubted that any potential buyer could match "the numbers we could get ourselves."
"We're looking at the possibility of selling the two buildings," Mr. Trump said, "because of the tremendous activity in the residential market."
Many Asian investors were drawn to New York real estate in the mid-1990's by bargain prices and a relatively stable market compared with the speculative fever in Hong Kong and Singapore.
The Lai Sun Group bought the Four Seasons Hotel on East 57th Street for $190 million, a great bargain considering that the hotel had cost $477 million to develop. But faced with large debts and falling property prices in Hong Kong, Lai Sun is now selling the hotel, albeit for nearly double the original purchase price.
Mr. Trump's Riverside South project was languishing in 1994 when New World and four other Hong Kong companies paid $88 million for a $250 million mortgage on the land that was held by Chase Manhattan Bank. Mr. Trump remained as the developer and got a 30 percent stake in the project after development costs. Under certain conditions, his stake could grow.

HEADLINE: Central Europe May Catch Russia's Cold, U.S. Warns

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin warned today that unless Russia's financial crisis is resolved, its economic troubles "could spread to Central Europe," placing two major regions -- Asia and Europe -- in simultaneous downturns.
In his first statement since President Clinton said on Sunday that the United States would support an international bailout of Russia, Mr. Rubin chose his comments carefully to avoid worsening the flight from Russian and Asian currencies. 
 "I think it would be fair to say that the situation facing the world today with respect to financial stability is unprecedented," Mr. Rubin told a group of executives on a Presidential export council. "Russia's a difficult situation. We have an obvious national security interest. There is also the risk, once again, of contagion that could spread to Central Europe."
Mr. Rubin has a clear political agenda: He has been trying for months to persuade a skeptical Congress to increase Washington's contributions to the International Monetary Fund by $18 billion.
He has met enormous resistance, with conservatives saying the fund interferes in free markets and liberals contending that it is saving wealthy investors by imposing austerity programs that make ordinary workers suffer.
Both Mr. Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence H. Summers, argue that Russia's latest crisis underscores the urgency of adding to the fund's war chest. American officials have said that if an aid package is put together for Russia, it would have to come from the I.M.F. and the World Bank, not directly from the United States.
At the same time, Mr. Rubin's warning today seems in stark contrast to his recent predictions that another major outbreak of trouble was unlikely.
Five weeks ago Mr. Rubin told the Foreign Policy Association in New York, "The probability of the crisis worsening or spreading, or of a major new crisis developing is low." He said essentially the same thing to Congress several weeks earlier, though some top aides winced at the time and declined to make the same prediction themselves.
Today, in a brief telephone conversation, Mr. Rubin said his earlier statements referred to "a systemic crisis that could have a material impact on our economy."
In his public comments today, he reiterated his belief that while the American trade deficit would rise "substantially" this year, the overall impact on the economy "has been relatively minimal."
"We're in a world right now where the only healthy economy, growing on a sustained basis, is the United States."
The Administration's concern, however, is that if economic contagion spreads beyond Asia, it will become harder and harder to insulate the United States.
At the heart of that issue -- and of Mr. Rubin's comments today -- is the question of how economic troubles in one part of the world worsen troubles elsewhere, a little-studied subject that has suddenly become a top challenge in foreign policy.
Some links are clear-cut. Southeast Asia's troubles, which began last summer, are being reignited by Japan's worsening recession, and in particular by the fall of the yen.
Japan is a major purchaser of Asian goods, so its downturn is an enormous weight on the region. The yen's fall only aggravates the problem, because it puts competitive pressure on other nations to let their currencies fall so the goods they make retain a price advantage over Japanese goods in other markets.
More tenuous is the connection between Asia's troubles and Russia's. Many view the link as primarily psychological: Investors are fleeing all emerging markets, regardless of their differences. In recent days, investors have not only fled Russia; they have gotten out of Brazil, Turkey and other, smaller markets. Each country has its own problems, but they are worsened whenever investors get skittish and flee to the relative safety of the dollar.
And Central Europe is still so closely tied to Russia that Moscow's troubles could quickly spread.
In Russia's case, the alarm bells are ringing in Washington, but not with enormous urgency. Deputy finance ministers from the world's largest industrial countries meet in Paris next week to discuss their next moves. Officials say it will probably take several weeks to put together a package of loans or emergency credits through the I.M.F., the World Bank and other international institutions. And the aid they are considering -- about $10 billion -- is about a quarter of what was promised to Indonesia, and a fifth of what was promised to South Korea.
At least that is the plan for now. In both South Korea and Indonesia, the problems increased dramatically while the fund and its members negotiated over what to do. The same could easily happen with Russia.
"When you are talking weeks, you are talking the vast unknown," one senior official in an international institutions dealing with Russia said today. "Several weeks is a very, very long time in the markets."

HEADLINE: Panel Finds Medicare Costs Are Underestimated by U.S.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
A bipartisan Federal advisory panel said today that the long-term costs of Medicare were likely to be higher than estimated by the Clinton Administration, because the program was likely to continue growing at a brisk pace.
That conclusion increases the pressure for major changes in the popular health program for the elderly. 
 The Administration had been assuming that the growth of Medicare spending per beneficiary would slow after 2010, just as the first baby boomers become eligible. But the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, at a two-day meeting that ended today, said it was just as plausible to assume that there would be no slowdown.
Medicare spending grows not only because the number of beneficiaries and their average age are increasing, but also because elderly people are receiving more health care and more costly services. The Administration assumed that the average annual growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary would gradually drop to about 4 percent, the commission said, but experience suggests that it could just as easily remain at around 6 percent.
Those differing assumptions lead to a difference of $760 billion a year in Medicare spending by 2030, the panel said.
The 17-member commission, created by Congress and headed by Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, has decided to assess the effects of all its proposals on Medicare spending under both sets of assumptions.
The panel is considering fundamental changes in the structure of Medicare, but has not yet made specific recommendations. The higher estimates of Medicare spending, considered more realistic by many commission members, accentuate the need for changes in the program to keep it solvent for 76 million baby boomers, born from 1946 to 1964.
One panel member, Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, said the estimates of Medicare spending could have a profound effect on the commission's recommendations, which must be submitted to the President and Congress by March 1, 1999.
Another panel member, Bruce C. Vladeck, former administrator of the Medicare program, said any forecast of Medicare spending beyond 10 years was "an exercise in comparative fantasy."
But most commission members said it was necessary to make such estimates because otherwise the panel would not see the huge effects of the baby boom on Medicare.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a commission member and former economic adviser to President Clinton, said history suggested that the Administration's estimates of future Medicare spending were, in fact, optimistic.
The Administration assumes that the growth of Medicare will slow so that costs per beneficiary eventually grow at about the same rate as the nation's economy, measured by the total output of goods and services per person. But Mr. Breaux and other commission members said this assumption was at odds with the history of Medicare because costs have generally increased faster than the gross domestic product.
Stuart H. Altman, a Brandeis University professor appointed to the commission by Mr. Clinton, said, "We are going to see a resumption of health cost increases in this country." If that coincides with the "tidal wave" of baby boomers reaching retirement age, he said, there will be immense pressure to restrict spending or to ration health care.
The advisory panel got a vivid reminder of the politics of Medicare when it convened today at the Library of Congress. In the audience were dozens of members of the Gray Panthers, an advocacy group for the elderly. They held up signs that said, "No more Medicare cuts!" They also demanded that the commission hold public hearings.
In an interview, Mr. Breaux said the commission would hold hearings on July 10 and 13 and seek public comment in other ways.
Commissioners agreed that they must also assess the overall fairness of the Medicare program and the adequacy of its benefits.
Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, a member of the commission, said he hoped that the panel would not become entranced with cost projections. "If this commission is simply about solvency," he said, "I'd like to get that cleared up right now, because I'm not sure I belong on it."

HEADLINE: A Heated Hearing on Partner Rights

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
The City Council held its first public hearing yesterday on legislation that would give domestic partners the same rights as spouses, prompting about 150 opponents of the measure to storm out of the meeting, complaining that the bill's supporters were allowed to monopolize the time at the microphone.
By the City Council's tally, 24 people testified in favor of the bill during the three-hour hearing and eight spoke against it. But among the 200 that showed up for the hearing of the General Welfare Committee, the overwhelming number came to oppose the bill, many of them massing on steps of City Hall to continue their protest after they walked out of the meeting in frustration. 
 "We went upstairs and we've been waiting and waiting and waiting," said the Rev. Ruben Diaz, president of the New York Hispanic Clergy Organization, which is based in the Bronx. "The chairman is laughing in our face."
Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, a Democrat from Brooklyn and the committee chairman, said he allowed people who had pre-registered to speak first, as is customary. Many of the bill's opponents said they showed up early yesterday morning to get in line, not realizing they were already too late.
Gay and lesbian groups said the measure would provide a historic guarantee of their rights, but it would also apply to heterosexual couples who register as domestic partners with the City Clerk's Office. The bill would insure that the domestic partners of city employees would have the same rights as spouses and also guarantee the rights of domestic partners who live in city housing.
Despite fervent opposition from some religious groups, the bill has widespread bipartisan support on the Council, thanks in large part to the stances of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who proposed the legislation, and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, its sponsor.
The committee plans to hold one more hearing on the bill before it is sent to the full Council for a vote later this month. But it was clear from the start of yesterday's hearing that there was broad support for the measure among some of the more influential Council members.
Mr. DiBrienza opened the hearing by calling the Mayor's championing of the bill "a courageous act."
The first witness was Randy M. Mastro, the Deputy Mayor for Operations, who said that Mr. Giuliani was keeping a campaign promise. Mr. Mastro also noted that most of the rights granted by the bill applied to domestic partners under executive orders already in place.
"It's about insuring that New York City law does the right thing by all of its citizens," he said. "The Mayor believes that this is the right thing to do -- that as a matter of fairness and equity, we should be codifying the letter and spirit of these executive orders." As Mr. Mastro began his testimony, a man in the audience, who would not give his name, shouted, "Giuliani is a liberal turncoat."
Paula L. Ettelbrick, the legislative counsel of Empire State Pride Agenda, a statewide lesbian and gay political organization, said the measure "insures that thousands and thousands of disabled, old, gay, lesbian and straight New Yorkers and our children will receive the economic, emotional and social support necessary for our families to thrive."
In the testimony he had prepared, Mr. Diaz of the Hispanic pastors' group said: "This law diminishes the meaning and sanctity of marriage. It eliminates the incentive for a couple to marry, motivating a life that goes against that which was established by God as stipulated in holy scriptures."
Mr. Diaz handed out copies of his statement before the meeting but left without reading his text because he had to wait so long to speak.
John Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, used one of his Sunday homilies last month to warn of the bill's possible harm to society. No representative of the Archdiocese of New York appeared at the hearing, but at its request, the Cardinal's homily was placed in the hearing record and Mr. DiBrienza read one passage.
Councilman Thomas K. Duane, who is openly gay, was unapologetic that most of the speakers were in favor of the bill. "If on this one occasion, supporters of a civil rights bill for lesbian and gay New Yorkers got to go first, I don't think that's going to change the balance sheet in terms of public discourse," said Mr. Duane, a Democrat from Manhattan.

HEADLINE: From Vending Snacks to Venting Anger;
Food Sellers Are Set to Protest Partial Ban on Carts, but Retail Rivals Like It

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
Three decades ago, a rail-thin immigrant from Greece raised an oversized umbrella on the corner of William and John Streets and staked his claim to a piece of lower Manhattan concrete. From now on, the gesture said, George Markopoulos would be selling hot dogs and sauerkraut from this location.
Nearly every weekday since then he has plied his trade, presenting each foil-wrapped hot dog to the customer as though it were a gift. 
 But just up John Street, another Greek immigrant named Tom Tsolomytis has spent the last two decades running the Roxy Food Shop, a 24-hour diner that advertises its specials -- "shrimp-salad sandwich, $3.50" -- on paper plates. And he has no appreciation for the panache, or the plight, of street vendors, whose numbers have grown in recent years.
"The only thing I know is they hurt my business," Mr. Tsolomytis said, a toothpick nestled behind his ear.
The inherent conflict between rent-paying business owners like Mr. Tsolomytis and street vendors like Mr. Markopoulos will reach a crescendo today, when hundreds of vendors are expected to participate in a morning-long demonstration to protest the Giuliani administration's decision to ban food carts -- as well as vendors selling items like clothing -- from 144 streets throughout the city, beginning in July. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has said the ban is needed to ease congestion on busy sidewalks.
The vendors plan to meet at Liberty Park in lower Manhattan at 9 A.M., hold a news conference, then walk down Broadway to rally in Battery Park. As a result, protest leaders say, thousands of customers will have to do without their cheap daily sustenance of street-corner fruit, sandwiches or coffee. In addition, the organizers say, companies that supply the hot dogs and soda, along with the bakeries that supply the doughnuts and bagels, are shutting down to show their solidarity.
"It's a shutdown for the whole day, and it's going to be a great turnout," said Jeff Cicio, the president of the Big Apple Food Vendors Association. "We want the public to know that we have a serious problem."
In fact, many customers interviewed yesterday said that the vendors did no harm in their current locations. And they said they liked the low prices, tasty if nutritionally questionable fare, and New York ambiance that the food carts represent. "I've been coming here for two and a half years, two times a week," said Anthony Pepe, a city employee who frequents Mr. Markopoulos's stand. "I think it's terrible that he'd have to move. I've never seen a pedestrian problem as far as where he stands."
The ban focuses on many of the narrow streets in the financial district of lower Manhattan. On the city's map, for example, the intersection of William and John Streets has become an X over the livelihood of Mr. Markopoulos, 58, who is hunched from so many years beneath his cart's metal overhang.
Several business-improvement districts agree with the Mayor's contention that the restrictions are needed to ease congestion on the sidewalks. They emphasize that the number of street vendors is not being reduced -- only the number of places where they can operate. But Mr. Markopoulos countered that the city's argument defied basic economics: if hundreds of vendors moved to sanctioned, out-of-the-way locations, the combination of less traffic and more vendors would hurt business for everybody.
"You don't make any money, and I don't make any money," Mr. Markopoulos said. "After all these years, I don't want to go someplace else."
But Carl Weisbrod, the president of the Alliance for Downtown New York -- a business-improvement district that filed many of the complaints that led to the restrictions in lower Manhattan -- said that in addition to congestion, another element is at play in the debate: competition. "There is the ongoing issue of complaints from retail establishments that pay rent and property taxes and whose owners look outside to see vendors who don't," he said. "And they are in direct competition right outside their own stores."
And if the travails of Mr. Markopoulos have resonance, so too do the experiences of Mr. Tsolomytis. Every morning, he walks up John Street to see carts everywhere, poised to sell coffee, bagels and doughnuts at discount prices. By 11 A.M., he said, those carts are sold out -- and his unsold doughnuts are turning stale near the cash register.
Mr. Tsolomytis, 54, who says he has not taken a vacation in a decade, said that he used to sell 15 dozen bagels a day; now he sells about 4 dozen. The recollection brings to his face an expression that does not match the message on his plastic coffee cups: "We are happy to serve you."
The same tension could be found in midtown yesterday between retail owners and food vendors, all vying in the same market of feeding people cheaply. John Poulos, the owner of the Deli-Burger Restaurant, on West 45th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, called the impending restrictions "a miracle," then sounded a familiar refrain.
"This place costs me $6,000 a month in rent, I have six employees, and utility bills to pay," he said. "And those guys pay nothing. I have to compete with these guys selling coffee and a bagel for $1. I sell it for $1 and lose 20 cents every time. But what am I going to do? I can't sell it for more than them or nobody will come here.
"I don't mind seeing one guy here, and one guy there, as long as they are spread out," he added. "But on this street, they are everywhere. I hope the restrictions are going to go through and I hope that Giuliani will stick with them. It's a blessing."
But the restrictions are a curse for Mohammed Kueder, a hot-dog vendor who has stationed himself at the northwest corner of West 56th Street and Avenue of the Americas for the last four years. Like so many vendors, he pays no rent, but incurs other expenses that eat into his small profit margin. He said he saw no recourse but to protest.
"I have to take care of my family," he said. "Maybe Giuliani will listen to us if enough people show up. I don't think the protest will work -- the Mayor has probably made up his mind -- but I hope it does."
Judging by Mr. Giuliani's comments yesterday, it is doubtful that the protest will affect his opinion on the matter. "The fact is that there are some parts of the city that are too overcrowded," he said. "There have been some food vendors that have engaged in unsanitary conditions -- more than a few. So we need some changes."
Such comments by the Mayor -- particularly the references to "unsanitary conditions" -- infuriate Mr. Cicio, who is organizing today's protest. He said that Mr. Giuliani was trying to sway public opinion by portraying the vendors as "dirty, smelly terrorists running nontaxpaying businesses," when "in fact we're the heaviest-regulated business in the city."
He said that the vendors hoped the protest would prompt the City Council to enact legislation to create more balance in establishing the locations where the vendors can operate. Last night, two Council members, Stephen DiBrienza and Anthony D. Weiner, said they would present a bill to disband the Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel, which is controlled by the Mayor and developed the new restrictions.
Meanwhile, the vendors have only the sympathies of some customers to ease their concerns. "Giuliani does great things, but sometimes I think he gets carried away," said Miguel Diaz, stopping for a knish at a stand on Church and Vesey Streets that will be required to move. "These stands have been a part of New York since Day One."
Late yesterday afternoon, Mr. Markopoulos tucked away the wooden platform he stands on to reduce back strain. He closed the metal doors of his cart, and then rolled his livelihood -- which has a photograph of his 2-year-old granddaughter wedged between a soda-can display -- through the winding downtown streets to Rich Street, where he and a few other vendors keep their carts in a warehouse overnight.
He said he wouldn't be needing the cart until Thursday.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Race to Buy the Browns Has a New York Flavor

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Howard Milstein, the real estate developer, and Chuck Dolan, the cable television magnate, have three things in common: lots of money, businesses that are located in the New York metropolitan area and a desire to own the soon-to-be-revived Cleveland Browns.
The race to buy the expansion Browns is accelerating, with Milstein's and Dolan's groups among six to have applied to the National Football League. No price has been set -- estimates range from $400 million to the moon -- but it will most likely be the costliest sports franchise ever for several reasons: a lucrative lease at a new stadium where the team will start play in 1999; immediate access to $70 million a year from new TV deals, and a rabid fan base that seems certain to support the new Browns as it did the old ones before Art Modell shipped them to Baltimore in 1996. 
 "We're not here because this is a fundamentally great investment," Dolan, the chairman of Woodbury, N.Y.-based Cablevision Systems, said yesterday from Cleveland, his hometown. "We love Cleveland and we want to own the Browns."
Milstein, who is a co-owner of the New York Islanders, said Monday from Cleveland: "This will be a very good business. We expect to realize significant value from the team as a business. You have to look at the whole issues of winning football and restoring tradition."
The Browns' move to Baltimore, where they were renamed the Ravens, was the most wrenching team shift since the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles. As part of the N.F.L.'s approval of the move, the Browns' name, colors and logos remained in trust for the new franchise.
"We think of the Browns as the team for the next century," Milstein said. "We're going to get it."
Like the other potential applicants, the Dolan and Milstein groups paid $150,000 to enter the process, and are being investigated by the N.F.L. for their financial worthiness before they receive economic data upon which to base their bids. An owner is expected to be chosen in September.
Milstein was persuaded to join the bidding five weeks ago by Calvin Hill, the former Browns and Dallas Cowboy running back, and Paul Warfield, the Hall of Fame receiver for the Browns and Miami Dolphins. Robert Lewis, a lawyer for Milstein, is also part of the group.
"If the job is to re-establish a winning reputation -- one that goes back in Cleveland to the 1940's -- we can do it," said Hill, a consultant to the Cowboys. "We know both sides of the ball. We had wonderful careers as players, but since I retired, I've been a consultant and administrator." Warfield is in private business.
Dolan returned to his hometown yesterday, with his brother Lawrence, a lawyer in suburban Cleveland, to announce that the entertainer Bill Cosby had taken a 5 percent stake in their ownership group.
Cosby was not an investor in the Dolans' group when they declared their interest several weeks ago. Cosby said he was not added as a token, to be a prominent symbol for a league without black ownership.
"I thought about it," Cosby added, but he said that the potential size of his investment, $25 million if the team costs $500 million, placed him in a different category.
Lawrence Dolan said, "I don't see the appropriateness of tokenism when we're discussing Bill Cosby."
Hill said he did not want to speculate about whether the Dolans added Cosby because they felt their group needed a prominent African-American. But, he said: "The fact that Paul and I are black and Howard and Robert are white is wonderful. We're not just people who fit categories. It was about getting the best team."
For Chuck Dolan, the Browns would be a personal investment, separate from Cablevision's acquisition of Madison Square Garden, which owns the Knicks and the Rangers. He would provide the bulk of the money to buy the team.
"I can assure anyone who is seeking wealth to get a good education and have a brother like I have," Lawrence Dolan said.
The Dolans and the Milstein group appear sanguine that the league will not price the team into the stratosphere; Malcolm Glazer, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' owner, reportedly said the price should be $1.5 billion. In the N.F.L.'s last expansion, Carolina and Jacksonville paid $140 million entry fees.
"We're prepared to bid the value," Lawrence Dolan said. "But it's important the winning bid not necessarily be the biggest bid."
Milstein echoed the sentiment. "If all they want is maximum dollars," he said, "maybe it's not a good business deal."

HEADLINE: Ending Suit, Merrill Lynch to Pay California County $400 Million

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK with LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 2

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch & Company agreed today to pay $400 million to Orange County, Calif., to settle claims that the leading Wall Street brokerage firm helped push the affluent county into bankruptcy four years ago with reckless investment advice.
The settlement will largely close the book on the biggest municipal bankruptcy in the nation's history, a financial debacle that was unthinkable at the time and resulted in sharply reduced services ranging from public schools to health clinics. 
 The bankruptcy also shook the foundations of municipal finance across the country and illuminated how treasurers of local governments can deploy enormous sums of taxpayer dollars in exotic investments that can go awry.
The settlement by Merrill is one of the largest in any securities-related litigation and is by far the largest stemming from the 1994 bankruptcy, which set off a storm of lawsuits as the county sought to recover some of the more than $1.6 billion in losses from high-risk investments.
Merrill, which has consistently maintained it did nothing wrong, said it had decided to settle because the costs and distraction of the litigation did not justify the battle. Even though Orange County had sought $2 billion, the magnitude of the settlement was still considered huge and goes a long way to restoring much of what Orange County lost.
The county still has lawsuits pending against 17 Wall Street securities houses and a variety of other companies. But Merrill was clearly the main target because it was much more heavily involved than other firms in selling risky securities to the county-run investment pool.
Now that Merrill has settled, lawyers predicted that others would follow.
"We're very pleased with the result," said Bruce Bennett, a Los Angeles lawyer who has represented Orange County. "We think it represents a very substantial recovery for Orange County."
The settlement with Merrill brings the county's total recovery from legal settlements to more than $621 million. Analysts and lawyers said that based on today's settlement with Merrill, they expect the county could end up recovering $800 million to $1 billion over all.
Even without fully recovering all the lost money, Orange County's financial condition has improved sharply, particularly in the last few years. The fifth-largest United States county, just south of Los Angeles, Orange County has a thriving technology industry, tourist attractions like Disneyland and an unemployment rate below 3 percent. The recovery in California's economy in the last few years has helped the county restore most of the social services that were cut immediately after the bankruptcy. Municipal officials said the money recovered would probably go mainly toward restoring capital spending that had been planned, then suspended.
"This is more part of Orange County's history than its future," said James Doti, president of Chapman University, which is in the county. "The economy of Orange County is doing great, but this cloud of bankruptcy has been hanging over our head. This is the last page of an ugly story."
The losses were suffered by 200 school districts, municipalities and other public agencies that invested in the pool run by Robert L. Citron, Orange County's treasurer at the time. He was released in October after serving two-thirds of a one-year jail term for misappropriation of funds. His deputy, Matthew Raabe, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Because the money recovered from litigation goes first to schools and then the other public agencies and municipalities, school districts have already recovered 98 percent of their losses, said Paul Brady, city manager of Irvine and chairman of the Orange County Investment Pool Committee. Municipalities and other agencies will be able to recover more than 90 percent of their losses after getting the proceeds from the settlement with Merrill. The county itself, however, is only now starting to share in the recovery.
Merrill, the largest firm on Wall Street, has said the decisions on the investments that went sour were made by Mr. Citron and that he was fully aware of the risks.
"We are confident that we acted properly and professionally in our relationship with Orange County," Merrill said in a statement today. "However, after weighing the substantial costs and distraction of continuing to litigate, we determined that it would be in the best interests of Merrill Lynch and all our constituents to definitively bring this matter to a close and end the uncertainty inherent in any judicial proceeding."
Merrill said it had already set aside money for the settlement, which will not affect its earnings for the second quarter.
In addition to paying $400 million to Orange County, Merrill returned $20 million in collateral it had kept after the bankruptcy. Merrill also agreed today to pay $17.1 million to the Irvine Ranch Water District, which had sued Merrill over the bankruptcy. Last year, Merrill paid $30 million in a settlement with the county district attorney to assure that the county would not bring criminal charges against it. It also agreed last year to pay $1.9 million to settle a class-action suit brought by holders of Orange County bonds.
But Merrill is still not completely free of the legal consequences of Orange County's bankruptcy. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether the firm violated securities laws in another role it performed for Orange County -- underwriting bond offerings. The S.E.C. is looking at whether Merrill adequately informed bond buyers of the risks involved, the company has said. The S.E.C. declined to comment today, but some lawyers involved in the bankruptcy predict that Merrill and the commission might also move toward settling.
The settlement with Merrill followed three weeks of mediation led by Judge John Davies of the Federal District Court in Los Angeles, who was not presiding over the case. The county's civil suit against Merrill had been scheduled to go to trial Sept. 15 in the Federal District Court in Santa Ana. Under the rules in the district, all cases heading to trial must go through mediation first.
The county argued that Mr. Citron had no authority to engage in some types of transactions he undertook with Merrill's help. The county also argued that some of the securities Merrill sold were inappropriately volatile for a government portfolio and that Merrill had prepared false and misleading sales materials. .
Some analysts said Merrill had an incentive to settle because, in contrast to some suits seeking huge damages, in this case the losses suffered by the investment pool were known. Had Merrill gone to court and lost, the damages could have been higher.
Zane Mann, publisher of the California Municipal Bond Advisor, a newsletter, said Merrill also had business reasons to settle. "Merrill hasn't been able to do business in Southern California since this thing broke," he said, alluding to Merrill's municipal bond business. "This is a calculation of what it's worth to get back into the bond market in Southern California."
Mr. Mann and some other analysts said the settlement with Merrill might have been a bit less than what the county wanted. But the county, too, did not want to do what Mr. Citron was accused of doing -- gamble with the public money by turning down a sure $400 million in hopes of getting more in a trial.
County officials said the county's net losses were actually several hundred million dollars less than the reported $1.6 billion because the risky investments had earned higher returns in some years before the bankruptcy. Moreover, they said, it is unreasonable to expect the county to completely recover its losses.
"The county was not blameless in these losses," Thomas W. Hayes, the former California State Treasurer who is in charge of the county's litigation effort, said in an interview.
Many of the suits against other brokerage firms are not active. One that is in the early evidence-gathering stage is against Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. So, lawyers speculated it might be next to go to trial. But Mr. Bennett, the lawyer for the county, would not identify the next target.
Mr. Citron, Orange County treasurer for 24 years, had sought to raise returns on the county's investments because a taxpayer revolt was putting a lid on property taxes. He invested in complex securities known as derivatives, which can rise or fall in value much faster than ordinary bonds do. He bet on lower interest rates, but rates kept rising, producing huge losses.
Merrill sold Mr. Citron many of those securities. The county also considered Merrill a financial adviser, though Merrill insists it was only a broker. Merrill also underwrote 4 of the county's 11 bond offerings over the period involved.
Despite the bankruptcy, the county never defaulted on its bonds, so the losses were confined to investors in the county pool, said Mr. Mann of the California Municipal Bond Advisor.
The county emerged from bankruptcy in 1996 and has an investment-grade credit rating from Moody's, though not from Standard & Poor's, which it is suing in connection with the bankruptcy.
Some say the brokerage firms are paying far higher penalties than the county ever did.
"There's plenty of blame on this to go around," said Joe Mysak, editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer. "Some might assign more blame to the county than Merrill, but this is not a perfectly moral universe."

Chart: "Paying a Price for the Failure"
The bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif., in late 1994 led to a series of criminal and civil lawsuits as the county and its bondholders sought to recover losses. Here is the status of some of the major lawsuits and criminal inquiries.
 
CIVIL SETTLEMENTS
 
LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & McRae -- $45 million
Announced in April. The county sued the law firm over its role as a bond adviser.
 
Credit Suisse First Boston -- $52.5 million
Announced last month. A brokerage firm that Orange County said had sold it risky and inappropriate investments.
 
KPMG Peat Marwick -- $75 million
Also last month. The county accused the accounting firm of failing to detect and warn it of the riskiness of the investments sold to it by the various brokerage firms.
 
Merrill Lynch -- $400 million
Announced yesterday. The agreement ended a lawsuit that argued that Merrill sold investments that were barred by California law and misrepresented how risky they were.
 
CRIMINAL CASES
 
Robert L. Citron -- $100,000
Pled guilty in April 1995 to securities fraud. Mr. Citron, the former county treasurer, was sentenced to one year in jail and a $100,000 fine.
 
Robert S. Rubino -- No fine
Pled guilty in September 1996 to violating a public records law. The conviction of Mr. Rubino, the former county budget director, was cleared from his record after serving 200 hours of community service and two years of probation.
 
Mathew R. Raabe -- $10,000
Convicted in May 1997 of misappropriation of funds and deceiving investors. Mr. Raabe, the deputy county treasurer, was sentenced to a three-year jail term and a fine, but he is free pending an appeal.
 
Merrill Lynch -- $30 million
Announced settlement in June 1997. The firm agreed to settle a criminal investigation by the county district attorney into its role in underwriting bonds.
 
ACTIONS BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
 
Orange County and several officials -- No fine
Announced January 1996. The county, its Board of Supervisors, Mr. Citron and Mr. Raabe agreed not to violate securities laws again.
 
Credit Suisse First Boston -- $870,000
Announced January 1998. The firm and two former employees agreed to pay a fine for misleading investors.
 
PENDING
 
Merrill Lynch may still be subject to an S.E.C. enforcement action.
 
Seventeen other firms, including Morgan Stanley; Bear, Stearns; Paine Webber and Standard & Poor's, still face lawsuits by the county.

HEADLINE: Alabama Governor Forced Into Runoff in 3d-Term Bid

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala., June 2

 BODY:
Gov. Fob James Jr. of Alabama, a party-switching Republican whose fervid support for school prayer has made him a national icon for religious conservatives, was forced into a runoff today in the primary for governor.
Although he finished first in a five-candidate field, Mr. James, 63, failed to win a majority and will face Winton Blount 3d, a Montgomery businessman and longtime Republican loyalist, in the runoff on June 30. 
 Mr. James, who is running for re-election to his third term (he served the first as a Democrat from 1979 to 1983), appeared close to avoiding a runoff with a late surge in opinion polls as he moved steadily toward the 50 percent threshold in the final week of campaigning. But the same dissatisfaction that lured four Republican opponents to challenge the incumbent apparently unsettled just enough voters to deny Mr. James a victory in the first round.
Mr. James and Mr. Blount now face the arduous task of turning out their voters for a midsummer runoff and competing for the support of the three other Republican contenders.
With 91 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. James had 163,711 votes, or 48 percent of the vote, while Mr. Blount finished second with 139,941 votes, or 41 percent. Former Gov. Guy Hunt, who decided to run after being pardoned of the state ethics conviction that forced his resignation in 1993, finished third with 8 percent of the vote. Two other candidates, Lewis Leslie McAllister Jr., a Tuscaloosa businessman, and Phillip W. Williams, a former state finance director, shared the rest of the vote.
In the Democratic primary, Lieut. Gov. Don Siegelman easily defeated his top rival, Lenora Pate, a Birmingham lawyer. Mr. Siegelman enters the general election with more than $3.5 million in his campaign treasury, a team of experienced Democratic strategists and an eye-catching policy proposal borrowed from the popular Democratic Governor of a neighboring state, Zell Miller of Georgia.
Mr. Siegelman has promised to push for a state lottery to finance college scholarships, pre-kindergarten programs and school construction. That plan is sure to strike a chord with Alabamians desperate to improve the state's educational system. But, as was the case in Georgia, it has already stirred opposition from religious conservatives who view the lottery as a first step toward the legalization of other forms of gambling. The Republicans also plan to portray Mr. Siegelman as an unreconstructed liberal and a captive of the state's trial lawyers' lobby.
In neighboring Mississippi, meanwhile, voters in the Democratic and Republican primaries selected Congressional candidates who will vie in the general election in November. The most closely watched race came in the Fourth District in southwestern Mississippi, where a large field of candidates from both parties competed to succeed Representative Mike Parker, a Republican who is retiring after five terms.
On the Republican side, Delbert Hosemann, a Jackson lawyer, and Phil Davis, a banker from Magee, finished first and second respectively in a nine-candidate field, forcing a runoff on June 23. In the Democratic primary, Ronnie Shows, a regional commissioner for the State Transportation Department, won a majority against two opponents.
The Alabama governor's race has been depicted by Mr. James's strategists and by national leaders of the Christian conservative movement as an important electoral test for the religious right.
During the last 16 months, Mr. James has taken a number of provocative stands aimed at returning religious expression to public schools and courtrooms, a mission with substantial grass-roots support in this deeply devout, conservative and populist state. In each instance, Mr. James has assailed the Federal courts as the mortal foe of God-fearing Alabamians, a tactic used by his predecessor, George C. Wallace, when this state's deep-seated resentment of Federal intrusion was stoked more by race than by religion.
The Governor has threatened to call out the National Guard to defend the right of a state judge in Gadsden, Ala., to display the Ten Commandments on his courtroom wall. He also has waged an aggressive campaign to defend a 1993 state law that permitted voluntary, student-led prayer in the schools. A Federal judge rejected the law as unconstitutional, leading Mr. James to assert that the Bill of Rights does not apply to the states and that state officials need not obey Supreme Court rulings when they believe that the Court has overstepped its authority.
Those positions, and the perception that Mr. James has placed more emphasis on school prayer than on economic development and education, quickly alienated some of the state's business leaders, who rallied around the candidacy of Mr. Blount, a longtime Republican activist who owns car dealerships and other companies. Mr. Blount, whose father was Postmaster General in the Nixon Administration, finished third in the 1994 gubernatorial primary.
In recent weeks, Mr. Blount has attacked Mr. James for raising taxes during his first term as Governor, and for profiting from a family-owned landfill that does business with the state. All of the state's major newspapers endorsed Mr. Blount, and his strategists hoped that Mr. Hunt, a Primitive Baptist preacher, would siphon Christian conservative votes from Mr. James.
But Mr. Blount's momentum seemed to stall in the final week of the campaign, as Alabamians focused on the race and moved toward Mr. James, whose son, Forrest H. James 3d, was quoted in The Birmingham News this week as describing his father as "a God-fearing redneck."
In the last week of the race, Mr. James promoted his pledge not to raise taxes, a promise that Mr. Blount rejected as irresponsible. And Mr. James, who counts Ralph Reed, the former director of the Christian Coalition, as a consultant, won endorsements from many of the country's Christian conservative leaders, including Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, Phyllis Schlafly, James Dobson and Donald E. Wildmon.
One poll published on Sunday found that 56 percent of those who believe the Bible is literally true said they would vote for Mr. James.

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Study Details Failures; Scouring of System Is Urged

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
United States intelligence "needs to be scrubbed" from the top down, from its spies to its analysts to its chief bureaucrats, according to the author of a classified report on the intelligence agencies' inability to foresee India's May 11 nuclear tests.
The debacle disclosed chronic failures of imagination and personnel, flaws in information-gathering and analysis, and faulty leadership and training, the report's author, retired Adm. David E. Jeremiah, a former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said today. 
 He said his investigation, requested by the Director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, had shown structural weaknesses in the Central Intelligence Agency and its sister services that go far beyond the question of India.
Among his conclusions were these:
*The C.I.A. had little or no "human intelligence," meaning spies, in India.
*The agency's ability to use people rather than machines to gather information is weak worldwide.
*The nation's spy satellites typically produce far too much information for overworked and undertrained intelligence analysts to handle.
*In India, satellites and analysts alike failed to focus on the nuclear test site, despite clear signs that a nuclear test was coming. Senior intelligence officials discounted those clues and did not order their subordinates to examine them.
Senior American policy makers and intelligence officials had an "underlying mind-set" that India would not test its nuclear weapons, Admiral Jeremiah told a group of reporters at the C.I.A.'s headquarters. That fixed idea was unaffected by the fact that India's newly elected Hindu nationalist leaders openly and repeatedly vowed to deploy the bomb. The United States never understood that India was driven by "national pride and pysche" to become a nuclear state, the admiral said. As a result, he added, its intelligence eyes and ears were blind and deaf to the test, which set off nuclear tensions and an arms race between India and its regional rival, Pakistan.
Admiral Jeremiah, a former commander of all American forces in the Pacific, described a kind of intellectual laziness at the intelligence services, on which the United States spends $27 billion a year.
"You fall into a pattern" and "you start to expect things to happen," he said. "You need to have a contrarian view."
The C.I.A.'s managers were passive, he said, instead of taking command and saying: " 'Who's in charge? Take charge. Make things happen.' "
The agency has talented people capable of great work, he said, and it "has had a startling number of successes" over the years. But it needs many more analysts with better training and sharper skills, he said. It should bring in outside experts to analyze major events. It must be "much more aggressive in thinking through how the other guy thought" -- breaking out of American political and cultural patterns to grasp the ways in which the rest of the world thinks.
Much of the criticism in Admiral Jeremiah's report has been voiced before. The House Intelligence Committee, for instance, reported last year that the C.I.A. and its sister services lack "the analytic depth, breadth and expertise to monitor political, military and economic developments worldwide." But rarely has a report commissioned by the C.I.A. drawn such swift and sweeping conclusions.
Other longtime intelligence officers concurred with Admiral Jeremiah's judgments.
Gordon Oehler, who retired last year as director of the C.I.A.'s Nonproliferation Center, said the group of intelligence analysts responsible for interpreting spy satellite photos was a far less skilled group than it was at the end of the cold war.
Mr. Oehler said the "contrarian views" that Admiral Jeremiah called for were sometimes disregarded by senior officials, which discourages fresh thinking. Clinton Administration officials dislike inconvenient facts about nuclear weapons, he said, and sometimes disregard information that does not fit "a preconceived view of what the world ought to look like."
Admiral Jeremiah, whose full report is not expected to be made public, said he would recommend that Mr. Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, make changes to improve the ways the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies gather and analyze information, manage their employees and train new people.
Mr. Tenet, who said he discussed Mr. Jeremiah's report with President Clinton today, immediately accepted those recommendations.
Mr. Tenet said that in a perfect world, the C.I.A. would never again miss an event that changes the course of history.
"I hope I could say that it'll never again occur," he said. "But given the problems we face in the world, and given the kind of resources and commitments we have around the world, U.S. intelligence is stretched, and we have to do the best we can."

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA PASSES MEASURE TO LIMIT BILINGUAL SCHOOLS

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 2

 BODY:
Californians today approved a ballot measure that would curtail three decades of bilingual instruction in the public schools here, paving the way for similar assaults on such programs around the nation, according to early election returns.
Strong majorities across major ethnic and racial lines expressed support in pre-election public opinion polls for the measure to effectively end bilingual education, though most Hispanic elected officials and all the major candidates for governor in both parties opposed it. 
 The measure , sponsored by Ron K. Unz, a multimillionaire software entrepreneur from Silicon Valley, tapped into widespread dissatisfaction among parents, politicians and educators. They argued that existing bilingual education programs, a legacy of the civil rights movement of the 1960's in which students are taught basic subjects in their native language while they also learn English, were not working well to prepare a huge new generation of immigrant students for the job market.
In another fiercely contested race, Lieut. Gov. Gray Davis, a 23-year veteran of state politics, rode a wave of support from traditional liberal constituencies to soundly defeat his richer rivals for the Democratic nomination for governor, Representative Jane Harman and Alfred A. Checchi, a multimillionaire businessman who spent about $40 million on his campaign, the individual record for any non-Presidential candidate in American history.
Mr. Davis declared victory just after 10 P.M. "My friends, this is truly an experience money can't buy," he told his supporters. Ms. Harman conceded defeat while Mr. Checchi was running a distant third. "Winning is more fun, but losing with honor ain't bad," Ms. Harman said.
Mr. Davis will now take on the Republican State Attorney General, Dan Lungren, who faced token opposition today in the state's new blanket primary in which the names of all candidates appeared on the same ballot regardless of party. They will compete for the right to succeed Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican who is barred from seeking a third term, in what promises to be a classic liberal-conservative contest over contrasting views of the Golden State.
At stake is a major beachhead of Presidential politics in 2000 and control of Congressional redistricting in the nation's most populous state for 2002.
Other races, including a fight for the Republican nomination for United States Senate between State Treasurer Matt Fong and Darrell Issa, another wealthy businessman, remained too close to call, as did a fight over a ballot measure that would require unions to obtain written consent from members before using their dues for political purposes.
Over all, it was the most expensive primary election campaign in the nation's history, with about $100 million spent on races for governor, United States senator and other statewide offices and on a handful of ballot propositions pro and con, including the bilingual initiative and the measure limiting the use of union dues.
With California on a sharp rebound from years of economic recession and natural disasters, voter interest was generally low in a state famous for political apathy, and turnout was predicted to reach no more than 40 percent of the state's 14.6 million registered voters. As usual here, most of the campaign played out in millions of dollars of television advertising, this year featuring charge and counter-charge by candidates in contested gubernatorial and Senate races.
The most contentious issue on the ballot was Mr. Unz's initiative, which will no doubt be subject to court challenges by opponents. It would essentially limit help for non-native speakers to a year of intensive English instruction, though parents could request a waiver if they believed their children needed special help. Its supporters contend it allows for flexibility and note that its only requirement is that instruction in general subjects be primarily in English.
But the measure's opponents, which included the California Teachers Association, the state Parent Teacher Association and President Clinton, contended that the measure would impose a rigid, one-size-fits-all solution on the state's diverse school districts, many of which have already chosen on their own to end or greatly modify bilingual programs.
The race for governor reflected intense volatility in voter sentiment, with each of the three Democratic candidates by turns taking first -- and last --- place in pre-election public opinion polls. But in the closing weeks of the race, Mr. Davis, 55, opened a clear lead over his rivals, Ms. Harman, 52, a three-term Representative from the beachfront communities on the south edge of Los Angeles, and Mr. Checchi, 49, the former co-chairman of Northwest Airlines, who was making his first run for elective office.
For months last year, most of the California Democratic establishment assumed that the the state's most popular politician, Senator Dianne Feinstein, would come home to run for governor and would be the overwhelming favorite to win the nomination. But despite encouragement from the White House to run, Ms. Feinstein announced in January that she would not, in part, she said, because she loathed the prospect of millions of dollars in attack ads from Mr. Checchi.
Ms. Harman entered the race on short notice, with her own private wealth and most of Ms. Feinstein's political team behind her, and promptly vaulted to the lead in the polls. But then Mr. Checchi began a barrage of televised attacks on her record and character that not only caused Ms. Harman to plunge in the polls but backfired on him as well. By May, half of all voters in the state viewed Mr. Checchi unfavorably, four times the level of February, according to a statewide poll by the Field Institute of San Francisco, and he never recovered.
Mr. Davis, meantime, who could not afford to begin television advertising until well after his richer rivals, benefited from their feud, appearing as a relatively unscarred, fresh face on the scene the moment he began airing commercials touting himself as the embodiment of "experience money can't buy." In fact, Mr. Davis is one of the longest-serving politicians in the state, with a career stretching back 23 years, to his days as chief of staff to Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.
On the Republican side, Mr. Lungren, 51, spent 10 years in Congress representing his native Long Beach. He is a classic California conservative in the Ronald Reagan mold, who as State Attorney General since 1990 has developed a reputation for toughness on crime. But he has also been faulted for ineffective handling of the state's ban on assault weapons and for being reluctant to join other states in litigation against tobacco companies. In addition, his strong anti-abortion stance has been seen by many political analysts as a potential vulnerability in a state whose Governor for the last eight years, Mr. Wilson, who is a Republican, supports abortion rights.
Even as Mr. Lungren coasted to the nomination, Mr. Fong, 44, and Mr. Issa, a multimillionaire car alarm entrepreneur, battled in an intense primary for the right to take on Ms. Boxer, 57, in November. Ms. Boxer, who was first elected to the Senate in 1992 after 10 years in the House of Representatives, had once been viewed as highly vulnerable this year, but recent polls have shown her leading both of her potential Republican rivals.

Bill Would Replace State Commerce Dept.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The State Department of Commerce and Economic Development would be replaced by a commission including business leaders under a bill introduced on Monday.
Under the bill, based on a proposal by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, policy for the proposed Commerce and Economic Growth Commission would be set by an 11-member board that would include the Governor, 5 cabinet members and 5 business leaders. Gualberto Medina, the State Commerce Commissioner, would be the commission's chief executive officer, said a co-sponsor, Assemblyman Kenneth C. LeFevre, a Republican of Egg Harbor Township. All 120 of the department's employees would be dismissed, and some would be rehired, but without civil service protection, Mr. LeFevre said. 
 Jeff Scott, a spokesman for the Communications Workers of America Local 1034, which represents the employees, said abolishing civil service requirements could reduce the commission to a patronage mill.

Brooklyn College

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
If public colleges continue to lose the support of voters and legislators at the present rate, they could become like "dead spacecraft, with no new missions to fly," Vernon E. Lattin, the president of Brooklyn College, told 3,000 graduates seated in the leafy quadrangle of the Flatbush campus.
Despite the booming economy, he said, the 50 states "are now spending $23.1 billion less for higher education than they were 20 years ago." New York State, he added, ranks 49th in the financing of higher education for every $1,000 of personal income.
The danger, he said, is that public institutions will become "smaller, more-expensive, semiprivate colleges and universities for those who can afford the higher cost."
Mr. Lattin concluded by urging the graduates to "do what you can to make sure that others may have the opportunity that you have enjoyed." 
 An honorary doctorate of humane letters was also awarded yesterday to Harry Belafonte, who brought the audience to its feet with a resounding rendition of "Daaay-O! Daylight come and you graduate!" It was an adaptation of the Banana Boat Song that became his signature calypso piece in the 1950's. WILLIAM H. HONAN

HEADLINE: Why Must Farms Use Migrant Labor?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your May 31 front-page article describes the unsafe housing conditions faced by migrant farm workers in the United States. As you report, New York State is no different from the rest of the country. However, unlike any other classification of workers, farm workers in New York are denied many other rights: collective bargaining, protection from overexposure to toxic chemicals, minimum-wage parity, agreements outlining the terms and conditions of employment, and one day of rest each week. On smaller farms, workers are also denied the right to bathrooms in the field and unemployment insurance coverage. 
 To make matters worse, among Gov. George E. Pataki's recent budget vetoes was the major source of financing for legal services to the poor, including farm workers. All workers deserve full protection of the laws.

HEADLINE: India's Strategic Misstep

BYLINE: By Stephen P. Cohen; Stephen P. Cohen, a policy adviser at the State Department from 1985 to 1987, will be joining the Brookings Institution this fall.

DATELINE: CHAMPAIGN, Ill.

 BODY:
In the three weeks since India conducted its nuclear tests, the tough talk of Indian leaders seems to have faded to a whisper. They are now proposing that their country and Pakistan sign a treaty agreeing not to be the first to use such weapons against each other. They have denied Pakistan's claim that India will conduct yet another nuclear test, and they have reiterated the country's longstanding call for global disarmament.
No one should be surprised by this abrupt about-face. As it turns out, the nuclear tests may have significantly hurt India's national security. 
 First, India may have reopened its competition with China, this time with a nuclear tinge. Indeed, the Indian opposition has charged that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has jeopardized years of painstaking negotiations with China that in recent years had begun to show dividends in trade and troop pullbacks along their disputed border in northeast India.
Now, this detente is at risk. China is likely to continue its flow of technical advice, military equipment and economic aid to Pakistan. And China may once again support Pakistan's position on the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir. China could also pressure New Delhi rather easily, by redeploying troops along India's northeastern border. This would force India to send soldiers back to the Himalayas, thinning its forces in Kashmir and elsewhere.
Moreover, India has not developed the medium-range missiles that could reach Chinese cities, whereas it is vulnerable to Chinese nuclear attack.
As for Pakistan, its military has developed various nuclear responses -- from tactical weapons to an all-out attack on New Delhi and Bombay -- to counter any military movement by India across the border. Pakistani officials have also spoken of deploying the Ghauri missile, possibly with nuclear warheads. If that happens, the lives of Indians in New Delhi, Bombay and a half dozen other cities will depend on the Government in Islamabad -- a Government in which it is unclear who commands and controls the deployment of nuclear weapons.
India has also needlessly angered the Clinton Administration, contributing to President Clinton's greatest foreign policy disaster. Not only was his Administration caught off guard, but his hopes for Senate ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty are dimmer than ever.
Nor is Congress likely to rescue India by lifting the economic and military sanctions that have now been imposed. Mr. Vajpayee had thought that American businesses dependent on the Indian market would rush to defend their interests. But India is now blamed for triggering a new round of proliferation, and Congress is unlikely to be sympathetic to any easing of the sanctions.
India's bombs were supposed to elevate it to the status of a great power. Instead, India finds itself with a worsening relationship with Pakistan, China and the United States. After the initial euphoria, it is clear that India must face reality and address the new strategic risks that it has created.

HEADLINE: A Small Card Maker Finds Itself Atop the Web

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY 

 BODY:
THE appearance of the site www.bluemountain.com at the top of various lists of popular sites has left Web watchers scratching their heads. Blue Mountain Arts is a small greeting card company based in Boulder, Colo., and known for its sincere if slightly treacly sentiment. But on the net, the Blue Mountain site is beating out big names like Disney Online, the bookseller Amazon.com and the Hotmail free E-mail service.
The site, which attracted more than 5,085,000 individual visitors in April, offers electronic personalized greeting cards commemorating everything from first holy communion to the death of a pet. For those occasions when you care enough to click the Send button, you can send messages that can include a picture and room for a personal sentiment, some animation and music. 
 "It just goes to show how different the Web is from anything else before it, in terms of business," said Stacie Leone, marketing and communications manager at Media Metrix, a New York company that measures Web audiences and recently found Blue Mountain to be the most popular shopping Web site. "A site like this that doesn't advertise and doesn't make any money out of its Web site can skyrocket to the top."
Media Metrix found the site ranked 13th among home computer users and 15th among people using their computers at work. Relevant Knowledge, an Atlanta company that tracks a panel of Web users, ranked it 17th most popular among all domain names in April.
To send greetings to friends who have E-mail accounts, senders pick designs and messages, or write their own, fill out address labels and send the completed greetings to another part of the company's Web page. Recipients automatically get E-mail announcements, including a Web site address and a message number. Go to the Web site, plug in your number, see the picture and message, and consider yourself duly greeted.
James McQuivey, an analyst of on-line retail strategies for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., explained part of the site's success. "They have this little secret going for them," he said. "When you use one of their cards and send it to a friend, he or she has to log into the site to receive it," thereby doubling the number of visitors.
Blue Mountain, which also sells cards on paper, has been able to find a market for electronic cards for Waitress Day, World Environment Day, the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and Eid Norouz, the Persian holiday.
"In the physical greeting card industry, you don't have the market there, but on the Web, it's not like those cards are taking up retail real estate," said Jared Schutz, Blue Moutain's director of business development. "We can offer cards for holidays we wouldn't necessarily offer in a store."
Blue Mountain's competitors include Greet Street, which charges 50 cents per greeting (greetstreet. com); the card is sent directly to the recipient's e-mail address. Another site, 123 Greetings (123greetings. com), offers messages grouped into categories like Kisses, Cats, Pizzas, Virtual Money (missives with pictures of bills; you choose the denomination) and Cuddly Tuddly, a collection of alarmingly cute stuffed animals. The site is slow, requiring the sender to go through nine screens to send a message.
Hallmark (www.hallmark.com) charges $2.50 for on-line greetings featuring animation and sound. The site requires customers -- even those ordering the free, lower-tech virtual greetings -- to sign in with a mailing address and password. The form asks, "Would you like to receive information about Hallmark products, services and events?" Not surprisingly, the default answer, Yes, is already checked.
(This is not the first instance of Hallmark's losing out to Blue Mountain Arts, which in 1986 successfully sued Hallmark to keep it from producing a line of cards copied from Blue Montain's line.)
Another site, based in Hong Kong (www.icard.com.hk), allows senders to add their own photos and sound files to greetings. An alphabetical listing of electronic postcards, from Angel Winks Heavenly Postcards to the Zodiacal Zephyr Card Shop, is available at www.wp.com/annag/ ecards.htm.
And check out the Amstel site there (www.amstel.nl/cam2.htm), with sendable views from a live camera in Amsterdam. What better way to say: "Having a wonderful time. Wish you were here"?

HEADLINE: House Proud;
Gothic Romance on the Hudson

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: NEWBURGH, N.Y.

 BODY:
A RIVER ran through them.
Clouds still linger on the craggy green cliffs overlooking the Hudson River. And if you stand on the wide Gothic revival verandas of houses that began a 19th-century design revolution here and squint past the subdivisions, it is possible to feel the kinship that Andrew Jackson Downing, Calvert Vaux and Frederick Clarke Withers had with this place. But the story has largely slipped into history's mists. 
 "This was the most ugly house you can imagine -- really nasty," Julian Hogan, a 48-year-old psychologist, said of the hilltop house she later learned was built in 1857 by a young architect named Vaux, who would meet Frederick Law Olmsted, a sometime farmer, on Newburgh's fertile ground and go on to design Central Park with him. "But something about the light was amazing."
After buying it she removed an inch and a half of wire-lathed stucco -- and uncovered an extraordinary, forgotten legacy. "I kept thinking, If people only knew."
Soon they will know. On June 6 and 7, this scrappy river city, home to one of the state's largest and most significant historic districts, will be the host of "Taste Makers of an Era," a two-day symposium and house tour that will examine the lineage of four 19th-century apostles of taste -- Downing, Vaux, Withers and Olmsted -- and the city that nurtured them. Among the featured scholars at the event will be Francis R. Kowsky, whose new book "Country, Park and City: The Architecture and Life of Calvert Vaux" (Oxford University Press) has prompted a reappraisal of the more silent partner in Olmsted & Vaux (the one whose name rhymes with fox).
Downing, Vaux's mentor and the son of a Newburgh wheelwright and nurseryman, became the leading taste maker of his generation, mostly through his writings. He drowned in the Hudson when fire broke out on a steamboat ferrying him to visit clients. It was 1852. He was 36. Vaux, the "clever young architect" Downing had plucked from obscurity in England and eventually made his partner, grimly identified the body. The coffin was laid out in the library of Highland Garden, Downing's house in Newburgh. "A terrific storm burst over the river and crashed among the hills," an observer wrote, "and the wild sympathy of nature surrounded that blasted home."
Downing had forged a naturalistic link between house and garden, a revolutionary idea that -- perhaps forever in America -- threw the corset of classical formality to the winds. Frederick Withers, another young English architect discovered and hired by Downing, would become a leading church designer and architect of wondrous Gothic revival buildings like the Jefferson Market Courthouse in Greenwich Village. The last collaboration between Vaux and Olmsted would be a park in Newburgh in Downing's memory.
Downing's historical timing was perfect. He appeared at a moment before the Civil War when a generation of home builders, the new American middle class, was seeking to define American style. It was in need of an oracle, an "apostle of taste," in the words of David Schuyler, an architectural historian.
In popular books and in The Horticulturist, his journal of "rural art and rural taste," Downing set forth his ideas about picturesque houses and gardens, advocating the Gothic revival style. He loved the Gothic for its "artistical irregularity." The variety of its forms, proportions, color, light and shade, Vaux later wrote, appealed to the eye "and through the eye to the mind."
An architectural evangelist, Downing told America's new middle class what it yearned to hear: that taste could be learned. At Highland Garden and other houses in and around Newburgh -- some of which, designed in partnership with Vaux and Withers, are on the tour -- Downing put his ideas about landscape into practice. (The houses were designed by Vaux and Withers; Downing had no formal architectural training).
From his property on the Hudson's steep slopes, he established a design firm catering to Newburgh's middle class; Vaux and Withers would continue the business for three years after his death. The grounds were poetry, with shadowy pathways, fragrant beds of moss and thyme and rustic log and bark shelters, so one could "linger and quietly communicate with the genius of the place," in Francis Kowsky's words.
Not surprisingly, Newburgh -- listed as one of the most endangered historic districts by the National Trust for Historic Preservation -- has a subculture of homeowners who consider themselves keepers of the flame. They have inherited french doors, breezy verandas, side porches, bay windows and quirkily placed chimneys. Like Downing, they tend to be messianic. This may be the only city in America where homeowners can quote verbatim from dogeared editions of "Cottage Residences," Downing's 1852 classic.
Lillie and Dan Hodge live in a house above the river that Vaux designed for William E. Warren, treasurer of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad and deputy comptroller of New York City. Conceived as a platform for viewing nature, the house is subtly planned, its public front tall and ornamental, with a simple, more horizontal back that has a view of the river.
Though Vaux "didn't invent a style of architecture," Mr. Kowsky notes, he had an eye for spatial arrangement, adapting each house to its location and allowing those who lived there to feel intimate with the landscape. That talent would be extravagantly expressed later in Central Park in spots like Bethesda Terrace, where the views were from naturally elevated areas "in a manner analogous to the way Vaux sited his houses," he writes.
The house has been in the Hodge family since 1953. Mrs. Hodge still has some of Warren's books, including a Bible with a big silver clasp. Not long ago, the Hodges hired Tom Pope, a house painter from Chatham, N.Y., to paint the place, which was originally coated in stucco. Vaux was drawn to "soft, quiet tones," but because the exterior had been sandblasted to reveal the brick, Mr. Pope felt it was O.K. to "make it jump out a bit." He striped the tin canopies, spruced up the rosettes and chose what he calls "an Olana theme" -- an allusion to the painter Frederic E. Church's sensuous Moorish reverie farther up the Hudson, designed by Church and planned by Vaux.
The Hodges' house now has a whimsical air. Lillie Hodge feels herself admiring it, especially when cleaning her pair of ballrooms. "It's a museum -- that's how I see it," she said. "But it's well lived in. There's no furniture you can't sit on."
Downing's romantic presence is palpable even in the driveway that wends its way to the 23-room Downing-Vaux "cottage" owned by Linda Anderson Henry and Scott Henry. As it turns, the drive reveals a three-quarter profile of the house, its irregular roof lines deliberate echoes of the distant hills.
The house was built beside a stream after Downing's death in what Downing called "the Rhine style," and it has been an object of passionate -- some might say obsessive -- interest for the couple since they purchased it in 1993.
Mr. Henry, a freelance political consultant, and Ms. Henry, a psychologist, had a "coming out party" for their house, to which they invited leading Downing and Vaux scholars. Mr. Henry, who studied architecture at Brooklyn Tech, has made a career of researching the history of his property. He speaks grandly of "classic Downing effects."
Though few Downing landscapes survive, there is a strong suspicion among landscape historians that the Henrys' yard, with its tulip trees, Osage orange trees, European beeches and native specimens, may be among them.
NEWBURGH residents who own and love these houses seem determined not to be intimidated by their illustrious architectural pedigrees. Though they proudly show off the original drawings of their house, designed by Withers in 1859, Carla and Robert Decker were bent on making it comfortable. While they restored the parlor, with its original gaslight ceiling fixture, they let the rest of the house "kind of just be 1998," as Mrs. Decker put it.
Houses like the Deckers' are testaments to an optimistic era in which the towns along the Hudson boomed with the river. Recent history, however, has not been kind to Newburgh, whose depressed economy and high vacancy rates are taking their toll on the historic district. In 1977, Morningside, an 1859 Withers house, was in such disrepair that its Gothic revival library was removed and reconstructed in the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. (The house, on the June 7 tour, has since been restored.)
"Poverty is a preserver of sorts," said Winthrop Aldrich, the Deputy Commissioner for Historic Preservation in the State Parks Department.
Still, there are signs of a rebound. The National Trust has recently set up a nonprofit development corporation to create affordable housing in the historic district. And the 35-acre city park designed by Vaux and Olmsted in Downing's memory -- finished, poignantly, by their sons, including one named Downing Vaux -- has been rejuvenated by the Downing Park Planning Committee. Downing is buried nearby, beneath a medieval-looking gravestone designed, naturally, by Vaux.
"It's like having a wonderful painting you scratched and discovered was a Rembrandt," Mr. Henry said of the city's uncommon lineage. "So what do you do? You keep on scratching."

The Sky Didn't Fall

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Finally the benefits of the nation's long-running economic expansion are reaching the folks at the bottom.
It was an article of faith not too long ago that an unemployment rate of 6 percent or less was bad news, a harbinger of runaway inflation and all the ills that accompany it. (Not surprisingly, this was never a doctrine advanced by the unemployed. It was a belief most fervently held by well-fed professors with tenure.) 
 Well, in April the jobless rate fell to 4.3 percent, the lowest level in nearly three decades, and the sky hasn't fallen with it. The numbers for May are not yet out, but over the past year or two there has been reasonably good news across the board for low-wage workers, and without a hint of accelerating inflation.
Jared Bernstein, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, noted that from 1996 to 1997 the hourly wages of the bottom 20 percent of workers increased by 3.2 percent in real terms. That compared with a 1.5 percent increase in the top 20 percent of wage and salary workers.
"That's an example not only of strong wage growth, but stronger at the bottom than at the top," said Mr. Bernstein. "You couldn't find a 3.2 percent increase at any point in this recovery for workers at the bottom.
"That said, these workers are in such a deep hole that these conditions would have to persist for a long time if they ever hope to make up their two decades of wage declines."
Mr. Bernstein and others have cited three principal reasons for the recent wage growth: tight labor markets, continued low inflation and increases in the minimum wage.
Two years ago, when Bob Dole was running for President, it was an article of faith among conservative Republicans that an increase in the minimum wage would result in job losses for low-wage workers. According to this doctrine, large numbers of employers would rather let workers go than give them a modest raise.
Dick Armey, the House majority leader and holder of a Ph.D. in economics, denounced the Democratic proposal to hike the minimum wage by 90 cents an hour as "a cruel hoax on the least-advantaged workers in the system." He said the minimum wage should be abolished.
William Niskanen, chairman of the conservative Cato Institute, told a House committee, "It is hard to explain the continued support for increasing the minimum wage by those interested in helping the working poor."
Return with us now to reality. Mr. Bernstein is the co-author, with John Schmitt, of a rigorous study of the impact of the 1996-97 minimum wage increase. It found that the increase raised the wages of nearly 10 million workers, most of them adults and more than half of them women, without causing job loss.
The study said: "The benefits of the increase disproportionately help those working households at the bottom of the income scale. Although households in the bottom 20 percent (whose average income was $15,728 in 1996) received only 5 percent of total national income, 35 percent of the benefits from the minimum wage increase went to these workers. In this regard, the increase had the intended effect of raising the earnings and incomes of low-wage workers and their households."
I am still waiting for Mr. Armey, Mr. Niskanen and their brethren to explain how this is a bad thing.
"I'm excited about the way things are lining up," Mr. Bernstein said. He noted that even the groups facing the most difficult employment hurdles, including young and less-well-educated African-Americans, are experiencing some improvement.
"A 20 percent unemployment rate is still a Depression-level number," he said. "But it's better than 25 percent."
The challenge now is to keep the economy moving in a way that benefits everyone, not just those at the top. It won't be easy. When the April unemployment numbers were released, the inflation hawks got their usual jitters. Was it time to raise interest rates and curb this spreading prosperity? Were workers making 10 or 15 grand a year becoming a threat to the nation's millionaires? Wouldn't it be prudent, at least, to jack up the jobless rate?
Stay tuned.

The Boeing Company announced yesterday that it would stop producing the MD-11 wide-body jet late next year and lay off some workers because of slumping demand for the aircraft.
Boeing, based in Seattle, said the move would not result in a special charge against earnings, as many analysts had feared. But it will reduce second-quarter earnings, though the company declined to specify by how much. 
 Boeing inherited the MD-11 last year when it bought the McDonnell Douglas Corporation for $16.3 billion. In November, Boeing announced that it was phasing out the MD-80 and MD-90, two narrow-body jets produced by what is now called Boeing's Douglas Products division.
Executives had hoped that they could continue to sell the three-engine MD-11, which has a passenger capacity ranging from 233 to 410, primarily as a freighter. But the financial crisis in Asia has forced many airlines there to shed older wide-body planes, which are expensive to operate, creating a large number of passenger jets that can be converted into cargo planes at a fraction of the cost of a new MD-11.
"Despite our best marketing efforts," said Ronald B. Woodard, president of Boeing's commercial aircraft division, "it became clear to us that there simply was not enough customer interest in either the passenger or freighter versions of this airplane to justify keeping the production line open."
Boeing said it had commitments for 22 more MD-11's and planned to deliver the last plane in February 2000.
The announcement leaves only the 717, a 100-seat, twin-engine jet formerly called the MD-95, as the remaining Douglas model in the Boeing stable.
About 3,000 workers at the former Douglas plant in Long Beach, Calif., now build the MD-11. An additional 600 workers build the plane's wings in Toronto along with 75 workers each in Salt Lake City and Melbourne, Ark.
Earlier this year, Boeing announced it would eliminate 6,200 jobs in Long Beach, most of that the result of phasing out production of the MD-80 and MD-90. But the company has more recently transferred some work on a new version of the 737, a narrow-body passenger jet, to Long Beach and is considering opening a line to assemble the 737 there.
Mr. Woodard said Boeing would do its best to find new jobs for the workers, adding, "But ultimately we will have to lay off employees for whom we do not have work."
The Canadian Press quoted George Capern, president of Boeing Canada, as saying that the Toronto wing plant, which employs about 2,000, would be phased out unless additional work was found.
But Sean O'Donnell, a Boeing spokesman, said, "We are looking to place additional temporary work in Toronto."

HEADLINE: Offices Money Can't Buy

 BODY:
If nothing else, the results of California's primary elections may cause multimillionaires to rethink their plans for midlife career changes. Never have so many spent so much to win so little. The businessman Al Checchi could have gotten a better return by spending his $40 million on Lotto tickets than by seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Representative Jane Harman, who finished right behind Mr. Checchi in the race, lost both her Congressional career and about $15 million of her husband's fortune. The car alarm magnate Darrell Issa spent $10 million of his own money chasing the G.O.P. Senate nomination, to no avail.
Like many elections so far this year, Tuesday's primaries were a rejection of checkbook politics and unrestricted spending. Lieut. Gov. Gray Davis, who beat Mr. Checchi, is a career politician who categorized his victory as "an experience money can't buy." Matt Fong, the State Treasurer, underspent Mr. Issa for the Senate nomination. Californians rejected Representative Jay Kim and his financial scandal. Mr. Kim, who recently pleaded guilty to accepting illegal campaign donations, was confined to his Washington home under a probation agreement. 
 The voters' contempt for rich newcomers has not been limited to California. Businessmen in Nebraska, Kentucky and other states outspent their opponents and sent overall campaign costs soaring, only to lose on primary day. Deep down, Americans may not really want to see their government run like a business after all. Mr. Checchi was not the first businessman-candidate whose history as a job-cutting downsizer came back to haunt him.
In another primary that was watched closely this week, the inability of Gov. Fob James Jr. of Alabama to win renomination outright was seen as the voters' effort to give the state a more reasonable image. Mr. James drew unwelcome attention to Alabama with his threat to call out the National Guard to defend a judge's right to post the Ten Commandments in his courtroom, and with his obsessive crusade for school prayer. Alabamans have good cause to believe that their real problems lie more in the direction of economic development and education. Mr. James's supporters may take heart in the fact that the upcoming primary runoff pits him against Winton Blount, a millionaire businessman. But Mr. Blount emphasized progressive policies, not bottomless pockets.
The most dramatic result of Tuesday's voting, however, involved not rich would-be governors but schoolchildren. Californians voted overwhelmingly to approve Proposition 227, which would drastically curtail bilingual education in public schools. The initiative's passage, which was apparently supported by many Latino parents, seemed to be more of a protest against the poor quality of public education than a reasoned analysis of how best to teach children who are not fluent in English. A more rational approach to the issue of bilingual education was passed by the California legislature this year. But it was vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson, whose impulse to pander seems to grow as Presidential election time approaches.
Voters defeated another proposal that would have restricted unions' ability to use their members' dues for political campaigns. They apparently responded to ads claiming that the proposition was a plot to quell critics of unpopular special interests, like H.M.O.'s. Californians may have come to realize that legislating by the ballot box is a rough tool that is easily manipulated and seldom accomplishes what they might hope.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Russia at risk, and the I.M.F.'s prescription raises concerns.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
YET another emerging market economy has been forced to the brink by financial panic. And yet again the International Monetary Fund is riding to the rescue.
Only this time around the economy at risk is Russia, which is far more feeble yet far more important in geopolitical terms than the Asian Tigers. And the drumbeat is growing from critics of the I.M.F., which places an enormous premium on stabilizing currency exchange rates, sometimes at very high costs. 
 "Russia is being asked to crush the opportunity for economic growth in the name of short-term market stability," said Jeffrey D. Sachs, the director of Harvard's Institute for International Development.
President Boris Yeltsin gets a passing mark on economic reform only if you grade on a curve. True, much of the economy's industrial base has been privatized. Inflation is down to single digits. And though the budget deficit in the first quarter of this year -- at 4.6 percent of gross domestic product -- was high by Western standards, it was right on the track set by the I.M.F.
What has not been done, though -- or has been done badly -- haunts the Government. Mr. Sachs, for one, makes a big distinction between its rapid privatization of manufacturing and its sale of natural resources, notably oil and gas reserves. The former was a step forward, since the only hope for modernizing Soviet enterprises was to introduce free market incentives. But the "virtual giveaway of hundreds of billions of dollars in natural wealth deprived the state of desperately needed revenues and created a powerful class of robber barons," Mr. Sachs argues.
The search for revenue has compounded Moscow's problems, suggests Richard Medley, a New York adviser on financial risk management. Under pressure from the I.M.F., tax rates were set high -- "so high that no one can afford to pay them," Mr. Medley said.
While the proximate cause of the financial panic of the last few weeks was the failure of the Government to sell off the Rosneft oil enterprise for some $2 billion, no one doubts that the stage was set by the financial troubles in Asia. And to some, the Asian Tigers' continuing wobble suggests that the I.M.F. has prescribed the wrong medicine.
Robert Wade, a visiting scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation, argues that the high interest rates and tight fiscal policy that the I.M.F. has demanded as a means of restoring confidence in the Asian currencies is destroying indebted, but otherwise healthy, businesses. "The I.M.F. spends too much effort defending old orthodoxies -- not to mention the interests of Asia's foreign creditors," he said.
For such skeptics, the big question is whether the I.M.F. is again applying flawed priorities and policies in Russia. Over the last three years, Russia's domestic inflation has outpaced the depreciation of the ruble by about 35 percent, Mr. Sachs noted. Yet the I.M.F. is encouraging the Yeltsin Government to use its dwindling credibility and foreign currency reserves in a last-ditch defense of the exchange rate.
Mr. Sachs is convinced the effort will ultimately fail. But even if it does not, struggling Russian businesses could be shattered by the exorbitant interest rates the Government is paying to hold the line on the ruble. This week, the Government raised more than $1 billion in a debt sale that included one-week bills yielding just under 40 percent. To service this debt, the Government will have to shift some resources that otherwise could have gone to keeping pensioners fed and coal miners paid.
Trouble is, the major alternative, a sharp depreciation of the ruble, would also inflict a blow to the feeble Russian economy from which it would not easily recover. With Russian banks and enterprises owing roughly $30 billion on securities coming due in the next year, Rudi Dornbusch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reckons that letting the ruble go would ruin the banks.
"One way or another, Russia faces a big balance-sheet problem," Mr. Dornbusch said: either it will be devastated by high interest rates, or debtors will face huge liabilities in dollars they probably will not be able to repay.
If there is a lesson here, it is that short-term capital is no friend to emerging economies. Russia's anarchic capitalism may have little in common with the highly organized cronyism of Asia. But in both cases, "hot money" has proved an Achilles' heel, magnifying the impact of more fundamental institutional weaknesses and immensely complicating rescue efforts.
Genuine reforms, ranging from changes in the tax system to application of the rule of law, are surely necessary to get the Russian economy moving. As long as Russia depends on the good opinion of international capital markets, though, those reforms may not be sufficient.

HEADLINE: A Nonmanufacturing Index Shows Growth

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Activity rose at nonmanufacturing companies in May from April, according to a new monthly survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management released yesterday.
The nonmanufacturing activity index was at 64 in May, the first official month of the survey. That is up from 63 in April, according to previously unreleased data. The association has been conducting pilot surveys for the new index since July 1997, when the index was at 57.5. 
 The new survey complements the group's 68-year-old report on manufacturing, which investors study for clues to the direction of economic growth. The new index correlates to the production index in the association's manufacturing report and not to the manufacturing report's main composite index.
The manufacturing survey covers about 30 percent of the economic activity in the United States, the group says, and the new report is designed to cover the rest. Purchasing and supply management officers at 370 companies will be surveyed each month.
The index measures the number of companies that report increased production or said they had paid more for raw materials, not how much nonmanufacturing industries produced or prices changed.
The May increase in the activity index reflects "the continuing strength of the U.S. economy," said Ralph Kauffman, chairman of the nonmanufacturing survey and coordinator of the purchasing and supply program at the University of Houston-Downtown. "Over all in May, nonmanufacturing industries continued to grow and to increase their employment, while paying less for purchased materials and services," Mr. Kauffman said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Prices Close on Downside, With Dow Retreating 87.44

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Resilient concerns about weakness in the technology sector pushed stocks lower yesterday, with the Nasdaq composite index falling more than 1 percent.
The drops in technology shares contributed to a late-day selling spree that spread across the market. It was worsened by a wave of computer-generated sell programs, which erased a small gain in the Dow Jones industrial average and left it with a loss of more than 87 points. 
 The Intel Corporation, the bellwether semiconductor issue, led the declines among technology issues. It fell 3 5/16, to 65 15/16, its lowest level since April 1997.
The stock came under pressure after a research analyst, Robert Chaplinsky of the Hambrecht & Quist Group, lowered his second-quarter earnings estimate due to expectations of slowing sales abroad.
A rumor that Intel would warn that April-June earnings could disappoint -- coming in at 65 cents a share compared with the 70 cents widely forecast -- contributed to the decline.
Intel's problems illustrated investors' persistent concerns about the technology sector. Worries about the impact of Asia's financial crisis on earnings as well as dampening domestic consumer demand have pressured chip makers, computer companies such as Dell Computer and software companies such as Hewlett-Packard.
Investors are worried that disappointing earnings from technology shares, which have been among the leaders of the current rally, could signal similar declines in other sectors, said Anthony Conroy, a managing director for Bankers Trust Global Investment Management in New York. Such concerns have heightened investors' unwillingness to buy stocks, continuing a recent trend in which early market gains evaporate into declines by the day's end.
"It's still a kind of skittish market and there's no real trend," said Charles W. Washington, head equity trader for Blaylock & Partners in Baltimore.
"The market is not capitalizing on the good news," said William E. Barker Jr., chief investment strategist at Dain Rauscher. He noted that recent planned merger deals such as Tellabs purchase of Ciena and American Home Products' joining with Monsanto had failed to excite investors and cause strong gains in those stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which traded higher briefly during the day, closed down 87.44 points. One sell program during the last 40 minutes of trading took 80 points off the blue-chip index, according to to Birinyi Associates, a Greenwich, Conn., research firm.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 10.49 points and the Nasdaq plunged 19.48 points, to 1,742.31, a 1.11 percent decline.
However, the long-term sentiment remains bullish with analysts like Goldman, Sachs's Abby Joseph Cohen forecasting that earnings growth will resume later in the year and propel stock prices higher.
Stocks are currently priced at fair value, Mrs. Cohen said in a recent market comment. The current climate of low interest rates and attractive fundamentals, such as the Federal budget surplus, well-managed corporations and solid financial institutions will be the catalysts to push prices higher, she said.
And investors like Mr. Barker and Alan Bond, chief investment officer at Bond Procope Capital Management, said they were ready to pick up stocks like Intel if their prices continued to fall.
"Intel looks pretty cheap here," said Mr. Bond, who recently sold some shares of the stock at a price above $80 a share.
"I would be a buyer on weakness, but I would make darn sure the company has visible earnings growth and a reasonable valuation," Mr. Barker said.

Treasury Prices Gain
By Bloomberg News
Treasury prices rose yesterday in slow trading as investors were reluctant to buy before tomorrow's report on May employment, which is expected to show the economy is strong.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 6/32, to 104 29/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.78 percent, from 5.79 percent on Tuesday.
"We're in a wait-and-see mode," said David Johnson, who helps manage about $30 billion in bonds at Van Kampen Capital Management in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill. Concern "that we may be running out of workers," may make the Federal Reserve more likely to increase interest rates, he said.
The report will probably show the jobless rate stayed near a 28-year low in May, economists said.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the labor market was "remarkably resilient" at a private meeting yesterday with central bank chiefs from Germany, France, Britain and Austria, according to a banker who heard his remarks.

HEADLINE: Korean Air, Bucking a Trend, Will Buy 27 Boeing 737 Jets

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Korean Air, bucking a trend that has seen many Asian airlines delay orders for new airplanes as a result of the region's economic crisis, plans to announce next week that it is buying 27 new Boeing 737 passenger jets valued at $1.35 billion.
The new order is expected to be announced Tuesday during the state visit to Washington of South Korea's newly elected President, Kim Dae Jung. It is good news for the Boeing Company, which said only last week that weakening demand from Asia would force it to cut production of the 747 jumbo jet next year. 
 Since the Asian economy went into a tailspin last summer, airline passenger traffic in the region has plunged as well. In the last week alone, Malaysian Airline System said that it would delay delivery of several Boeing 747 and 777 airplanes and Taiwan's Eva Airways, dropped plans to buy at least six long-range A340 aircraft worth $900 million built by Airbus Industrie, Boeing's archrival.
Boeing is also concerned that an order it is expecting to get from China during President Clinton's state visit there later this month will be smaller than the company had hoped.
"We are extremely pleased that Korean Air is exercising leadership in Asia by stepping forward, even during difficult times, with this order," said Carie Cable, a Boeing spokeswoman.
But selling the single-aisle, twin-engine 737 is not nearly as lucrative for Boeing as selling wide-body models like the 747 and 777. And Boeing apparently gambled that by the time Korean Air begins taking delivery of the planes in the year 2000, Asia's economic crisis will be over.
Yang Ho Cho, Korean Air's chief executive, said in an interview that the airline, which is a subsidiary of the Hanjin Group and is already heavily in debt, has had trouble borrowing overseas since South Korea's economy collapsed last year. He said Boeing was willing to accept a smaller down payment for the new planes, giving the airline time to arrange financing later.
"We believe by the year 2000, when our economic situation improves, financial institutions will offer to finance it," he said.
Until then, Mr. Cho added, Korean Air, too, may have to consider delaying its purchase of new wide-body jets. The airline plans to receive a total of 10 747's and 777's and Airbus A330's this year and a combination of 11 more in 1999.
"We are looking at right now," he said. "It depends on the economic situation. We have the option to delay."
Mr. Cho said that the new 737-800 and 737-900 aircraft will replace 26 older Fokker and McDonnell Douglas narrow-body jets. They will be flown domestically and on routes to China, Japan and destinations in Southeast Asia.
Korean Air already flies to dozens of cities in China and it is betting heavily on China's future economic growth. Mr. Cho said that with the completion of a new international airport in Inchon in 2000, South Korea had the potential to become a major hub connecting travelers from North America to China.
The new airplanes, which have a longer range and are more fuel efficient than Korean Air's current narrow-body fleet, will also lower the airline's maintenance costs and give it more flexibility. Right now the airline must use a 250-seat Airbus to fly from Seoul to Ho Chi Minh City because it does not have a smaller plane that can fly the distance.
Some analysts suggested that the order was a way for South Korea to thank the United States for supporting the $50 billion bailout the country received from the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Cho said that the timing of the order and President Kim's visit was "just a coincidence."
But, he added, "Probably President Kim will be proud to talk about this with President Clinton when they meet."

HEADLINE: Despite Furor Over China, Clinton Defends Trade Status

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
President Clinton announced today that he would renew China's trading privileges, signaling that he would not back away from his policy of engagement despite the rising Congressional clamor over whether the Chinese Government illegally contributed to his campaign and used protected American technology to improve its missiles.
In a Rose Garden ceremony, Mr. Clinton argued that links with China supported a range of American economic and security interests. And he called trade "a force for change in China, exposing China to our ideas and our ideals, and integrating China into the global economy." 
 While Congress is expected ultimately to approve China's trade status after the President returns from a visit there later this month, Republicans made clear today that they intend to exact a high political price. The House and Senate have 90 days in which to reject Mr. Clinton's formal recommendation of what is known as "most-favored-nation status" for China.
The threat of revoking the trade status -- the benefit that the United States grants to almost every country in the world except those it regards as terrorist states -- is one of the main instruments Congress uses to show its displeasure with China over human rights abuses and other problems, and with the Administration's policy toward Beijing. The threat has been raised repeatedly through the Bush and Clinton Administrations, although the United States has never actually revoked it.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has said he is reconsidering his long-held support for extending the trade status. Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, said today: "I think the current circumstances make this a very difficult vote. While most of us embrace trade as something that's healthy for the peoples of all countries, we really have a serious group of national security concerns before us."
House Speaker Newt Gingrich threw his support behind renewing China's trade privileges. "Seeking to keep China open to the West has proven to be the most effective way to advance our democratic values in this turbulent region of the world," Mr. Gingrich wrote in a letter to the President today that was also signed by two other Republicans, Bill Archer of Florida, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Philip M. Crane of Illinois.
Yet even as they pledged to work with Mr. Clinton in a "bipartisan manner" on China trade, the three Congressmen indicated that they would look into the charges against him. Rehearsing what they called disturbing accusations, they promised full investigations.
Republicans have accused President Clinton of risking American security by permitting the Chinese to launch satellites for a company that contributed heavily to the Democrats. They have said that some technology may have been transferred that could have permitted China to improve its missiles. Congressional committees and the Justice Department are investigating whether the Chinese Government illegally contributed money to the Democrats during Mr. Clinton's re-election campaign.
As a candidate in the 1992 campaign, Mr. Clinton derided the policy of engagement with China, but as President he came to accept and then embrace it. Today he praised it as a means of assuring security.
"Our engagement with China serves American interests," Mr. Clinton said, citing "stability in Asia, preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction, combatting international crime and drug trafficking, protecting the environment."
Mr. Clinton said that cooperation with China had become even more important in light of the nuclear standoff between India and Pakistan. He appeared in the Rose Garden today with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was preparing to depart for a meeting in Geneva among five nuclear powers to discuss South Asia. The meeting is to be run by the Chinese.
Warning that developing nuclear weapons would make the Indian and Pakistani people "poorer and less secure," the President said, "The international community must now come together to move them to reverse course and to avoid a dangerous arms race in Asia."
Later, in a briefing at the State Department, Ms. Albright acknowledged past Administration concern that the Chinese helped Pakistan develop its nuclear capacity. But she said that "in recent years they have changed their behavior vis-a-vis the Pakistanis" and "are not providing any assistance to unsafeguarded projects."
In their one-day meeting, the five nations -- the United States, Britain, China, France, and Russia -- hope to draw up joint proposals on India and Pakistan. The Administration wants to persuade both nations not to arm missiles with nuclear warheads or to engage in more provocative rhetoric or military activity.
"Right now, the most important thing both sides can do is to cool it and take a deep breath and to begin to climb out of the hole they have dug themselves into," Ms. Albright said in the Rose Garden.
American trade with China now amounts to about $75 billion a year, with China vying with Japan as the nation contributing the most to the American trade deficit. While the United States imported $62.5 billion in goods from China last year, it exported only $12.8 billion in goods to China.

HEADLINE: Calling All Lifeguards! (Even Nonresidents)

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
This one has city officials stumped: Why are there not enough lifeguards to staff New York City's seven beaches and 55 outdoor pools, despite an aggressive recruitment initiative?
"We're simply not optimistic," said Alan Moss, the first deputy commissioner for the Department of Parks and Recreation, the agency that recruits the expert swimmers. "There's a genuine shortage of qualified lifeguards." 
 Even though his agency has the budget to hire 1,200 lifeguards each summer, the city has hired only about 400 this year, with summer less than three weeks away. As a result, since the Memorial Day beach openings, large sections of the city's beachfront have been closed, presenting a hardship for bathers and vendors alike.
The situation is so dire that for the first time the city is allowing nonresidents to apply for the lifeguard jobs, which pay $8.64 an hour for 48-hour weeks. Furthermore, the Parks Department has recruited in high schools and colleges in New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island and Westchester.
Mr. Moss said that with the robust economy, high school and college students could be finding more lucrative jobs that also give them more leisure time. He also said that there may be a shortage of candidates because high schools do not emphasize swimming the way they used to.
But J. D. LaRock, a spokesman for the Board of Education, pointed out that there has been an increase in the number of swimming teams in city high schools, up to 74 this year from 68 last year. Still, only 29 of the city's 208 high schools have swimming pools.
Besides placing ads in 12 local newspapers and magazines and having the Mayor announce openings on his weekly radio program, the Parks Department arranged a tie-in with a "Baywatch" event on April 22 in Washington Square Park, in which two of the show's stars, Michael Bergin and Angelica Bridges, made appearances and urged people to try out for the city's lifeguard positions.
Still, the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, who held a news conference yesterday on the Coney Island Boardwalk to criticize the city's failure to prepare the beach for summer, said he did not think the Parks Department was doing enough to combat the lifeguard drought.
"It's been a dismal failure," Mr. Golden said. "On Memorial Day, 10 out of 22 bays were closed here in Coney Island. What's needed is borough-wide, year-round recruitment."
At the news conference, in which he complained about the condition of Coney Island's boardwalk and public restrooms, Mr. Golden advocated moving lifeguard hiring from the Parks Department to another agency, perhaps the Board of Education.
"They don't seem to be able to get their act together," he said of the Parks Department. "They should provide training year round for people interested in the job."
Chuck Reichenthal, the district manager of Community Board 13, which covers Coney Island, said the lifeguard problem has hurt business for local vendors.
"We get complaints from people in the community and businesses," he said. "What was the point of replenishing the beaches? We have long, clean beaches waiting for swimming. People from Staten Island like one section of the beach and when people come and find out the section they like is closed, they get upset. If they have to walk seven blocks to the beach because a section is closed, they might not come back."
In order to qualify for the city's weeklong, 40-hour lifeguard course -- passing it guarantees the job -- one must be at least 16 years old, able to swim 50 yards in 35 seconds, have at least 20/40 to 20/30 unaided vision, and have a doctor's note stating that he or she is in good physical condition. To pass the 40-hour course, applicants have to be able to swim 440 yards in 6 minutes and 40 seconds for beach patrol, and be able to swim 440 yards in 7 minutes and 40 seconds for pool patrol.
"We won't compromise public safety," said Henry J. Stern, the Parks Commissioner.
He said that the Parks Department only hired 870 lifeguards last year, so parts of some beaches were closed. "But there was no drowning on our watch," he added.

HEADLINE: Merrill Makes Strategic Move In Ending Suit

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE with ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
From the day, more than three years ago, when Orange County, Calif., shocked the world of finance and filed for bankruptcy, to the announcement this week that Merrill Lynch & Company had agreed to pay $400 million to settle litigation for its role in that matter, Merrill has maintained its innocence.
In fact, until it agreed to write this check, Merrill had kept a combative stance -- refusing to oust any employees involved in the Orange County disaster, hiring platoons of lawyers to defend itself and keeping up a public relations campaign. 
 But in the intervening years, much has changed, even though Merrill continues to assert its innocence. Those changes, some say, explain why Merrill, around a month ago, signaled to Orange County that it was ready to negotiate in earnest to head off a scheduled September trial in a $2 billion lawsuit brought by the county. The lawsuit contended that Merrill had sold speculative securities, in violation of California law, to a county-run investment pool that lost $1.6 billion after making a wrong-way bet on interest rates.
For starters, Merrill was finding itself shut out of much municipal business in California and its reputation as a municipal bond underwriter and financial adviser was tarnished throughout the country by this episode. A trial with headlines that would put the phrase "investment losses" in the same sentence as Merrill Lynch would only rekindle much of this bad publicity just as it was beginning to die out.
In addition, at a time when the financial services industry is being reshaped by multibillion-dollar mergers of Wall Street brokers, like Merrill, and banks and insurance companies, Merrill would find it easier to be a player in this merger game, either as a buyer or seller, with no major lawsuits still outstanding.
Under its chief executive, David H. Komansky, Merrill has been a leading lobbyist in Washington for legislation that would eliminate many of the regulatory barriers to these mergers and allow them to proceed more easily. "From Merrill's point of view, the more publicity that they would get from Orange County, the worse it would get for them," said Raphael Soifer, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. "They were facing the publicity of a long trial and, also, the uncertain outcome of a hometown jury. It seems like settling would be the reasonable thing to do."
James Spiotto, municipal finance attorney at Chapman & Cutler in Chicago, added: "Right now, Orange County is far enough in the memory for lots of people that it's like water over the dam. Merrill wants to keep it behind them."
Settlement talks between attorneys for Merrill and for Orange County began in earnest around three weeks ago, after the country had already gained $172 million from three lesser defendants, KPMG Peat Marwick, Credit Suisse First Boston and LeBoeuf, Lamb, Green & MacRae. Mediation talks, under local rules in Federal court in California, are mandatory, but are not binding on the parties. In those talks, however, Thomas W. Hayes, the former California state treasurer who heads Orange County's litigation effort, said it "became clear it was a difficult lawsuit that could go either way before a jury."
George Schieren, Merrill's general counsel, said: "The question for us was whether you are better off with the certainty of a negotiation or risk the uncertainty of a trial. This has nothing to do with how we feel about our conduct. A jury could see it differently. We made a decision that we were much better off with the certainty of a settlement. We took the mediation process seriously."
A settlement, even as large as $400 million, clears Merrill to proceed more easily in the emerging financial marketplace -- freed from having to go before shareholders and boards of directors of companies they might wish to acquire or join and provide guesses of their dollar exposure in Orange County and, again, explain their behavior.
"There's the argument, and it's all very speculative, that Merrill is folding its cards quickly to clear the decks," said Samuel G. Liss, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. This year, Merrill has taken new strategic steps, spending $7 billion to acquire Mercury Asset Management, a London-based firm, and taking an equity stake in the former Yamaichi Securities in Japan.
According to Merrill, the $400 million payment will not hurt earnings, nor will it affect employee compensation. Mr. Schieren said that reserves had already been set aside to fully cover this and that any impact on earnings had already been felt.
Still unresolved, however, is a potential Securities and Exchange Commission action against Merrill. Merrill has confirmed the S.E.C. has authorized its staff to bring an enforcement action over allegations of lax disclosure in Merrill's role as an underwriter of Orange County debt. Merrill has already paid $30 million to Orange County to settle a separate criminal case -- and, now, is fighting to keep all documents related to that case out of the public domain.
Michael Stamenson, the Merrill securities salesman at the center of the scandal, is still employed at Merrill's San Francisco office. "He's working full time on the litigation," Mr. Schieren, Merrill's lawyer, said.
For some in Orange County, the settlement is good news, especially since a strong Orange County economy has softened the blow of the investment losses. "It's a major settlement," said Paul Brady, city manager of Irvine, Calif., "It far exceeds our expectations when we first got into it. And, when we look at the county four years later, it's basically business as usual."

HEADLINE: Shunning the Art of Spin, Bahrain Seeks Investors From U.S.

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
In his first visit to the United States in seven years, the Emir of Bahrain came this week not to buy American military hardware or ask for more protection against Saddam Hussein, but to woo American investors.
Quietly. 
 That's because Sheik Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa doesn't like to play rainmaker. The Emir did not stop by New York's citadels of capitalism the way President Jiang Zemin of China did last year, when he visited the New York Stock Exchange and I.B.M. Instead, during his stopover in New York, the Emir chose to recover from jet lag and meet privately with the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan.
The man who has been Bahrain's monarch for 36 years did not give one speech, grant one interview or hold one news conference during his brief stay. There was no opportunity for reporters to ask questions either before or after his meeting with President Clinton on Monday. A two-and-a-half page joint statement was released instead.
Bahrain has loyally acted as host to the Navy's Fifth Fleet for decades and even accepted more American troops and equipment during the recent crisis with Iraq.
But the Emir did not demand a state dinner, with flags flying along Pennsylvania Avenue and a 21-gun salute on the White House lawn, as a payoff. He settled for a less lofty "official" two-day visit instead, which at least gave him lodging at Blair House, the residence across the street from the White House.
By contrast, President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea, who will come to the United States next week on an official visit, will be honored at a black-tie dinner given by Mr. Clinton at the White House. The Emir got lunch. For most countries, the art of commercial diplomacy is to get out and tell your story. And if Bahrain had more oil, perhaps the Emir's reticence wouldn't make much of a difference.
But Bahrain is the smallest, the least wealthy and the most crowded of the six monarchies on the Persian Gulf. Seventy percent of its population is under the age of 27.
Over the years it has survived by building itself up as a service-based economy, the banking center of the Persian Gulf and an oasis for Saudi-based Westerners who can drive across the causeway from Saudi Arabia to relax and drink alcohol.
Now it wants to diversify beyond oil and aluminum.
"Oil money is not enough anymore for the new generation in every gulf country," said David M. Ransom, who was the American Ambassador in Bahrain until last year. "The Emir came to Washington this time to project his Government not just as a staunch friend in security matters but as an attractive destination for business and investment."
So why not tell your story?
"The problem with the Bahrainis is that they just don't have the P.R. gene," said an American businessman with long ties to the country. "They don't understand how to project their image. Poor guys."
The Emir did rub shoulders with corporate America at a dinner given by six corporations -- Caltex, Turner Broadcasting System Inc., Lockheed Martin, Citibank, Chevron and Leo Daly -- at the Four Seasons Hotel on Monday night. He made a few opening remarks, but left it to his Finance Minister to give a speech on why Bahrain is such a good place for American investors.
"We would welcome more U.S. financial institutions to join us in the Middle East's pre-eminent financial center," said the Finance Minister, Ibrahim Abdul-Karim, in his speech.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Are Highest Since 1986

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 3

 BODY:
The nation's auto industry reported that May was the best month for car and truck sales since September 1986, with sales totaling 1,511,661 cars and trucks, a 12.1 percent increase from the corresponding period last year.
Moreover, fueled by hefty price discounts, the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for light vehicles reached 16.3 million cars and trucks last month, the highest level since October 1987. 
 Sales of both cars and trucks increased though truck sales showed a higher rise. Car sales totaled 793,066 units, up 6.9 percent; light-truck sales topped 718,575 units, up 18.4 percent.
"The fundamentals of the economy are very strong," said Michael DiGiovanni, the chief forecaster at the General Motors Corporation. "A lot has been written about the industry slowing down, but frankly it's hard to see that happening because of low unemployment, low interest rates and high consumer confidence."
Sales, however, were buoyed by attractive incentive programs. Auto makers spent as much as $1,600 a vehicle on incentives in May, up from about $1,100 a year earlier, analysts said. In mid-April, G.M. sent certificates worth $500 to $1,000 to previous buyers of G.M. products to use toward the purchase of 50 different models, above and beyond other cash rebate and low-interest loan incentives.
The program was an effort to rebuild G.M.'s market share in the United States, which had dropped to below 30 percent earlier this year. In May, G.M.'s share of the United States car and truck market rose to 32.5 percent. The Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation matched G.M.'s Loyalty First program with their own customer loyalty plans and agreed to accept G.M. certificates. G.M. did not agree to take Ford and Chrysler coupons. The loyalty programs run through July 2.
General Motors said today that it sold 484,168 cars and trucks in May, an increase of 12.4 percent over May 1997. G.M.'s truck sales increased 19.2 percent, to 226,114 vehicles, the third consecutive month G.M. has set a record for truck sales, pushing G.M. well ahead of Ford in truck sales. G.M.'s car sales also increased, up 7 percent at 258,054 units.
Ford reported today that it sold 353,270 cars and trucks in May, up 1.2 percent from May 1997. Car sales totaled 141,558, down 5.5 percent; truck sales were 211,712, up 6.2 percent from last year. Chrysler said Tuesday that it had its best month ever in May, selling 250,031 cars and trucks, a 27 percent increase.
Also reporting higher sales this week were Honda, Mitsubishi, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi, Land Rover, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and Subaru. Nissan sales were off 12 percent at 52,992 cars and trucks. Volvo, Mazda and Hyundai also reported lower sales.
Based on May's strong performance, G.M. and Ford said they expect sales for the full year to come in at the high end of their original forecasts, about 15.2 million cars and trucks. G.M. and Ford had predicted full-year sales would total 14.7 million to 15.2 million cars and trucks.
While auto makers and analysts predict a healthy year for vehicle sales, the quick pace of spring sales may have borrowed sales from the second half of the year. "The terrific numbers in May aren't sustainable," said David Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities Inc. in New York. "The coupons are bringing in car and truck sales from the second half into the spring. But at some point, the auto makers will have to start paying the piper."
The highly competitive vehicle market is likely to keep the level of consumer incentives relatively high throughout the year, analysts said.

Moreover, it lists industry sales and U.S. market share figures during both May 1997 and May 1998 for vehicles sold in the United States. (Source: Ward's Auto Info Bank)(pg. D2)

The Great Japan Money Rush is on.
With $9 trillion in private savings up for grabs, international banks and money managers are hurtling into Tokyo to stake their claims. Japan's "Big Bang" market liberalization, which began in April, is breaking down the barriers and luring the likes of Travelers Group Inc., which this week bought a 25 percent share of Nikko Securities, the country's third-largest brokerage firm. 
 Merrill Lynch & Company and the GE Capital Corporation have already picked up ailing Japanese institutions or their branches and are now trying to rescue them with Western-style management and marketing techniques. And still other American companies will be making a giant push over the next few months, in part because by December foreign institutions will be allowed for the first time to sell mutual funds in partnership with Japanese banks.
In their struggle to win a larger share of the market in the world's second-biggest economy, the Americans are redrawing the rules of the financial playing field here and sending shock waves down the halls of their Japanese competitors. And though foreigners have stumbled in the dark for years in Japan, this time the prize is too big to ignore.
"I don't think there's any other opportunity in the world three, five, ten years from now that's a larger opportunity than Japan in the asset management business," said John R. Alkire, a managing director who heads Morgan Stanley Asset Management in Japan, a unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "If you want to stake out your house in this gold rush, you want to make sure you get your pegs out there as far as you can."
It is not just the Americans who are rushing in; the Swiss Bank Corporation, for example, has formed an asset management venture with Japan's Long-Term Credit Bank. But while other Western institutions are also prospecting here, it is the Americans who have put down the most claims.
The goal is a chunk of the savings of people like Megumi Narita, a young training consultant who keeps her money in a neighborhood bank -- earning less than 1 percent interest. The Japanese are enormously conservative investors, leaving the bulk of their savings in banks and the postal savings system, but young people like Miss Narita are increasingly fed up with the dismal interest rates.
"I often see middle-aged men on the train reading the stock market tables in the newspaper, and I want to buy, too," Miss Narita said the other day, discussing investments with friends. "But as a young woman, I've always been a bit embarrassed to do so. And I never can figure out what the tables say anyway."
The challenge for the Americans will be to persuade Miss Narita, and millions more like her, to take the first step and actually make new investments. Indeed, the money management and insurance landscape has proved to be a minefield for starry-eyed foreign companies in the past. For years, foreign companies banged on doors here, trying to break into this intensely clubby, closed and secretive market.
Merrill Lynch opened three branches in the late 1980's and 1990, only to close them in 1993. Fidelity Investments, the giant mutual fund arm of the Boston-based FMR Corporation, has had an office here since 1969, but its sleepy business did not get very far, until recently. Likewise, after winning its first pension management account in April 1990, Mercury Asset Management Japan Ltd., a unit of Merrill Lynch, had to wait two years before it got a second.
What is different now is that Japan's Big Bang is liberalizing the arcane rules that have fettered the financial industry. Under international pressure to revive its sinking economy and its rigid markets, Japan seems willing to let foreign companies acquire its institutions, or pieces of them, to gain a place on an inside track.
In short, the Americans are now knocking on doors that the Japanese Government appears eager to open.
"For the last 50 years, we have been relatively isolated, insulated from the rest of the world in terms of information technology and finance," said Eisuke Sakakibara, Vice Finance Minister for international affairs. "That has to change."
For that reason, American companies are betting, as they roll out their new marketing strategies, that profits will pile up. After all, many of them remember just how well they did after London's Big Bang in 1986 and New York's May Day liberalization in 1975. Those efforts led to a broad restructuring of the financial markets in Britain and America, and now Americans and Japanese alike are hoping that the liberalization will do the same for Japan.
Yet Japanese companies are also petrified by what they call the Wimbledon phenomenon: since Britain opened up its national tennis tournament to foreigners, few Britons have won the title. Similarly, while Britain's Big Bang made London a major international financial center, British companies wound up playing only a minor role.
It is far too soon to say that the same thing will happen here, but one trend seems clear: American companies are competing with Japanese institutions on their home turf and, in the process, changing the way the market works.
"Foreigners have been a catalyst for change in Japan," said Clifford J. Shaw, president of Mercury Asset Management Japan. "Whatever way it happens, we are going to get from here to there. We are going to get a more efficient financial system."
Certainly, Japanese and American companies have been tying the knot in droves through alliances, partnerships and cooperative ventures in asset management and insurance. The Bankers Trust New York Corporation is forming a business arrangement with Nippon Credit Bank, for instance, while American International Group is interested in acquiring Aoba Life Insurance. And in discussing his company's deal with Nikko, Sanford I. Weill, chairman and chief executive of Travelers, said that a similar arrangement with a Japanese insurance company might be next.
Other American companies are increasing their marketing efforts, and the response has been promising. When Fidelity ran color advertisements in Japanese newspapers last December, telephone inquiries came tumbling in, even though the first ads did not include a phone number. When Fidelity did display its number this spring in two more ads, there was a flood of several thousand calls.
For several companies, business is already rolling in, along with nice fees. Goldman Sachs Investment Trust Management Japan Ltd., a unit of Goldman, Sachs & Company, began selling investment trusts just over two years ago, and now it has $6 billion under management. Similarly, within four months from opening its first trust in December last year, Merrill Lynch brought in $2.5 billion and had to slow sales. Alliance Capital Investment Trust Management Inc. has gathered $5 billion in 17 months.
The competition, of course, is going to become extremely fierce, the profit opportunities are likely to shrink and not everyone, including the operations run by foreigners, may survive. For now, though, there should be enough business to go around, especially because there are so few formidable players.
And while the rules have already been relaxed in pension management, regulations will soon allow companies to offer new and varied kinds of trusts that are similar to American-style mutual funds.
Japanese investors are wary of their own stock market, which has been depressed since the early 1990's, so they have shied from Japanese investment trusts, which tend to put money in domestic stocks and bonds. But many Japanese are now flocking to foreign-run trusts that invest in overseas stocks and bonds because they believe -- sometimes mistakenly -- that the foreign managers have more expertise and better results. Indeed, in April, foreign companies for the first time sold more investment trusts here than the Japanese did.
It is not clear that Japanese customers fully understand what they are getting into, for foreign investments often carry a currency risk, namely that a rising yen will wipe out profits earned abroad. It could take just one bad wave -- a turn in exchange or interest rates -- and the Japanese might go running back to their friendly local brokers, who have visited them in their homes for years and worked hard at forging strong relationships.
Last year, Nomura Securities was caught in a financial scandal and some of its businesses were suspended for up to five months. Commercial customers fled to other underwriters, including Merrill. But now Nomura has recovered and nearly all of that newly won business has disappeared, Merrill says.
"We don't underestimate the value of relationships that Japanese banks have had for many, many years," said John P. Sievwright, the new president of Merrill Lynch Japan Ltd. "They don't fall apart overnight, and they certainly won't fall apart because of Big Bang."
But those relationships are at least fraying, and the American companies are preening their different colors and jockeying for position to catch the stray cash.
Merrill is taking over 33 branches and 2,000 employees from Yamaichi Securities, a fraction of the operations of Japan's fourth-largest brokerage firm, which filed for bankruptcy last fall. Merrill estimated that it would incur net costs of $125 million for leases, furniture, salaries, technology and market development this year. This summer, Merrill will operate the largest non-Japanese brokerage-firm network in the country, though it says its branches will look pretty much the same as when Yamaichi was running them.
There will be important differences, though, aside from new products and the absence of uniforms that female employees had to wear when Yamaichi was in charge. Merrill's employees will be trained as financial planners to offer advice to customers, rather than merely act as brokers. Still, when it opens its doors this summer, Merrill is counting mainly on the old Yamaichi customers to provide business.
As for Fidelity, it is taking a different approach, one much like its direct strategy at home: reliance on the telephone. In addition to a small phone center it has already set up, Fidelity may use a piece of land it recently purchased on the outskirts of Tokyo to build a larger telemarketing operation. So far, it has gathered nearly $3 billion to manage, up nearly 40 percent from the end of 1997.
GE Capital spent $575 million to take over 500 sales offices and the new business of the Toho Mutual Life Insurance Company -- without the debt and other demons from the Japanese company's past -- and has already hung its signs on the doors. Analysts hailed the deal as a smart way to gain entry.
But GE Capital is wary of overconfidence, and it says that to win business it will simply have to do a better job than its Japanese counterparts. It brings with it a few ideas to lower costs, such as centralizing the back-office processing activities and standardizing credit decisions.
"We don't come here and find we can walk all over them, by any means," said K. Rone Baldwin, president of GE Capital Japan. "The fact is that Japanese companies have an enormous capability to improve and change. When challenged, they have been historically able to rise to the occasion."

HEADLINE: Russia Passes a Test In Critical Auction Of Treasury Bonds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 3

 BODY:
Russia's unsteady economy survived a critical test today as the Government sold nearly $1 billion in Treasury bills without paying the colossal interest rates that the bonds traded at just a week ago.
Anxious foreign investors, fearing the Treasury bill auction would fail to draw enough investors, breathed a sign of relief. While the auction did not raise all the money the Government sought, it was judged a moderate success. Stock prices rose in Russia for a second day. But a more skeptical bond market was mixed. 
 Russia also sold $1.25 billion in long-term bonds, so-called Eurobonds, to international investors mostly in Europe and the United States.
But today's auction also illustrated Russia's economic predicament. Since the Government did not raise all of the money it needed to cover debts that are coming due, it will be forced to dip into its reserves.
And the auction raised the question of how long Russia will be able to stagger on without billions of dollars in additional financing from the International Monetary Fund. But President Boris N. Yeltsin has been busy this week lining up support for his policies from business leaders. Page A12.
"They have done well so far," said Al Breach, an economist at the Russian-European Center for Economic Policy. "But this has been a very hairy week, and each week is going to be hairy until investors have more confidence."
Another 5.5 billion rubles in Treasury bills, or about $900 million, comes due next week. The following week still another 8.1 billion rubles, or $1.3 billion, in Treasury notes matures. That has led many investors to argue that billions of dollars in additional loans from the monetary fund and other international organizations are needed to help Russia keep its currency stable and restructure the cost of its short-term debt.
In today's auction, the interest rates ranged from 40 percent to 54 percent.
Russia depends on the sale of Treasury bills to finance its huge budget deficit, which last year was 6.1 percent of the country's gross domestic product. The goal is to reduce the deficit to 5 percent this year through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. Reducing the deficit is a crucial goal because interest payments on the debt amount to about a third of total spending, more than double the level in the United States.
"The Russian Government cannot carry on paying 50 percent interest rates for a long period of time," said Mr. Breach. "It will kill the budget."
As Russia's markets have been pounded by the global economic crisis, the Yeltsin Government has been desperately trying to reassure investors both at home and abroad.
Foreigners own about about a quarter of the Treasury bills, making Russia's financial stability vulnerable to the calculations and whims of far-off investors who have a tendency to abandon a distressed country just when the money is needed most.
Russia had been making progress pushing down the Treasury bill interest rates when the currency crisis erupted in Asia. As investors lost confidence in emerging markets, however, rates began rising as they began cashing in Russian Treasury bills for rubles.
The investors had contracts with Russian banks that allowed them to convert the rubles into dollars, creating a surplus of rubles and weakening the value of the ruble against the dollar.
Today's auction followed several failed attempts to raise enough funds to pay short-term maturing debt. The auction actually involved three types of Treasury bills known as GKO's. One type matured in 343 days, another in 126 days and another in 7 days -- the shortest Treasury bill Russia has ever issued.
To stir up demand, President Yeltsin summoned Russia's 10 leading businessmen and financiers to the Kremlin on Tuesday and told them they had a duty to invest in Russia.
In selling the bills, the Finance Ministry was determined to hold down its borrowing costs. It was operating on the expectation that investors will soon regain confidence in the market or that interest rates will drop after the monetary fund leads a bailout.
The ministry sold the seven-day bills with an average interest rate of 40 percent. The other bills had an average interest rate of 54 percent.
While those rates are very high for an economy in which inflation is running at about 12 percent, they are a far cry from the 80 and 90 percent interest rates of last week. They are even a bit lower than the interest rates paid on Tuesday by the secondary market in Treasury securities.
But holding down interest costs also meant that the Government did not sell all the bills it offered. The Finance Minister, for example, was ready to sell 2.5 billion rubles worth of seven-day bills. It sold half a billion rubles worth.

HEADLINE: PRIMARIES '98: THE SOUTH;
Gov. James, in Runoff, Tries Body Blows

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala., June 3

 BODY:
After forcing Gov. Fob James Jr. into a runoff in the Republican gubernatorial primary on Tuesday, Winton Blount 3d today cast his coming four-week duel with Mr. James as a chance for Alabama to stop electing leaders who "continually embarrass us."
Several hours later, Mr. James rose to the bait in a news conference performance that Mr. Blount will undoubtedly use to illustrate his point. In essence, the Governor responded by saying that Mr. Blount is fat. 
 Mr. Blount, a wealthy and, yes, portly businessman, had backed up his criticism of Mr. James by recalling moments like the Governor's threat to call out the National Guard in support of a judge's insistence on posting the Ten Commandments in his courtroom. He also referred to the day several years ago when Mr. James mocked the theory of evolution at a state school board meeting by "walking across the stage like a monkey," with his shoulders hunched and arms hanging limply in front of him.
And so when Mr. James, a former college football star who made a fortune in the barbell business, was asked at a news conference to respond to Mr. Blount, he said: "Well, I'm a monkey that's in good shape. I'm not a fat monkey."
Mr. James was asked whether he was saying that Mr. Blount was fat.
"I leave that to you," the Governor replied, "but if he says I'm a monkey, I'm not a fat monkey and I'm not a monkey whose daddy has put $2.5 million in my campaign, either. Make of that what you want to. If he says I'm a monkey, I must say: 'Well, I'm a pretty slim monkey. I'm not a fat monkey.' "
Mr. James's comments were not the first references to Mr. Blount's physique made today by a member of Alabama's first family. Early this morning Mr. James's wife, Bobbie, told reporters for The Birmingham News and The New York Times Regional Newspaper Group that she did not care for Mr. Blount's attacks on her family's ownership of a landfill that has received some business from the state. "He's a big, fat sissy," she told the reporters.
Today the Blount campaign manager, Sonny Scott, said his first instinct was to laugh at Mr. James's remarks.
"But then you realize that this is the Governor," Mr. Scott said. "Governing is supposed to be serious."
Mr. James, whose fervid support for school prayer has made him both a conservative icon and an object of derision, finished first in a five-candidate field on Tuesday, but failed to win the majority needed to avoid a runoff. He took 48 percent of the vote, while Mr. Blount got 41 percent. Former Gov. Guy Hunt, who decided to run after being pardoned from the state ethics conviction that forced his resignation in 1993, finished third, with 8 percent.
The Republican primary has been depicted by Mr. James's strategists and by national leaders of the Christian conservative movement as an important electoral test for the religious right. Until the June 30 runoff, at least, the test remains inconclusive.
In the Democratic primary, Lieut. Gov. Don Siegelman easily defeated his top rival, Lenora Pate, a Birmingham lawyer, by winning 78 percent of the vote. Mr. Siegelman enters the general election with more than $3.5 million in his campaign treasury and the luxury of watching his Republican rivals attack each other for another month.
Tuesday's primary, while posing the potential to divide Republicans in November, proved a landmark for the party in Alabama. The statewide Republican primary turnout of 358,757 shattered the record, of 215,046, set in 1996. For the first time, Republican turnout exceeded Democratic turnout, although by only 1,420 votes.
Mr. James, 63, attributed his runoff to the growing pains of a newly vigorous party. He said he had prevailed in primary runoffs in both of his successful races for governor, one as a Democrat, and would do so again. He urged voters to focus on the state's low unemployment rate, his pledge to reject tax increases and his efforts to improve schools.
Mr. Blount, 54, whose campaign has received $2.5 million in loans from himself and various family members, clearly hopes to make the runoff a referendum on Mr. James. Like many business leaders in the state, he argued that Mr. James's provocative positions on school prayer and his pitched battles against the Federal courts had damaged the state's reputation and handicapped its economic development efforts.
Speaking of Mr. James's recent assertion that the Bill of Rights does not apply to the states, Mr. Blount said, "These are things that bring up images of the past that just aren't as good as we are as a state."
But Mr. James defended his leadership style. "I think he's out to lunch on that," the Governor said of Mr. Blount. "I think my behavior is every bit a gentleman."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Iowans Pick Nominees for Governor
 Jim Ross Lightfoot, the most conservative of three Republicans vying to succeed Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, easily won his party's nomination in a primary on Tuesday. State Senator Tom Vilsack, the more liberal of two Democrats, won as well, and will oppose him in November.
Mr. Branstad, the nation's longest-serving Governor, is retiring after four four-year terms. Democrats have not held the Governor's Mansion in Iowa for 30 years, and analysts say the Republicans once again go into the fall with big advantages, including Mr. Branstad's continuing popularity.
In the Democratic primary for governor in New Mexico, Martin J. Chavez, a former Mayor of Albuquerque, topped a field of six to win a spot on November's ballot against the first-term incumbent Republican, Gary E. Johnson.
Two House races in New Mexico drew national attention.
In one, State Attorney General Tom Udall, a nephew of former Representative Morris Udall, won a chance to carry his famous family name back to Washington, winning the Democratic primary for the House seat held by Representative Bill Redmond, a Republican freshman.
In the other, for the seat of Representative Steven H. Schiff, a five-term Republican who died in March, the primary winners were Heather Wilson on the Republican side and State Senator Phil Maloof on the Democratic side.

HEADLINE: House G.O.P. Leaders Agree to End Timber Road Subsidy

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
After years of bitter debate over logging on public lands, House Republican leaders have agreed to end one of the Federal Government's longstanding subsidies for the timber industry.
For decades, timber companies that harvest logs from national forests have been able to offset the costs of roads that they first must carve into the woods. In compensation for those road-building expenses, the Forest Service has given the companies credits that have been used to reduce the price for trees taken from public lands. 
 For years, environmental advocates and opponents of the Government subsidies have fought the practice as economically wasteful and ecologically foolhardy.
The arrangement, which linked logging and road building in a rebate system in which money spent on roads could be counted as partial payment for timber, was seen by environmental advocates as reinforcing two activities that wreak compound damage on forests. Quite apart from the logging, the forest roads break up wildlife habitat and promote erosion that scars the land and fills clean streams with sediment, environmental groups say.
Republican lawmakers on both sides of the debate have decided it was time to concede victory to the industry's opponents and to accept the Clinton Administration's proposals to end the subsidy program, which is known as the timber purchaser road credit.
As part of the compromise, which aides said was endorsed by Speaker Newt Gingrich, the two sides agreed not to propose or support any other amendments relating to forestry when the annual spending bill that pays for the Forest Service's operations comes to the floor this summer.
This tactic is designed to foreclose an effort by environmentalists to cut other road-building programs from the agency's budget.
The proposed accord among Republicans brings together some of the logging industry's most loyal allies and some of its persistent adversaries, as well as chairmen of the House committees that deal with forest policy. Thus, it could effectively snuff out the forest debate.
That is why the deal has nonetheless upset some environmental advocates who oppose all forms of Federal support for logging and have been working for broader reductions in logging on public lands, especially in areas without roads.
The agreement was pushed mainly by Representative John Edward Porter, Republican of Illinois, and it demonstrated the continuing influence of a bloc of 30 to 50 moderate Republicans with pro-environment leanings. It also suggests that the House leadership has little stomach for divisive environmental debates in the last few months before Congress adjourns for elections this fall.
"Congressman Porter regards this as a major victory for environmental common sense as well as a fiscally sound change in policy," said Dave Kohn, Mr. Porter's spokesman. "This is a major victory for the environmental wing of the party."
Among the Republicans who met last Thursday in Mr. Gingrich's office to shake hands on the agreement, aides said, were Representatives Don Young of Alaska, the chairman of the Resources Committee; Helen Chenoweth of Idaho; Ralph Regula of Ohio, chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior; Sherwood Boehlert of upstate New York; H. James Saxton of New Jersey; George Nethercutt of Washington, George P. Radanovich and Wally Herger of California and James C. Greenwood of Pennsylvania.
Although only Republicans have endorsed the deal, it appears likely that they have the numbers to prevail in the House, even if some Democrats object. The Senate would have to agree, as well, for the plan to become law.
Last year a spirited debate on the issue split the House and the Senate in two narrow floor votes, with the industry barely prevailing to protect the road-building program.
Industry officials contend that the program is not a subsidy at all, in the sense that without the road credits loggers would simply offer to pay less for the logs they remove.
"The purchaser road credit has created a lot of controversy, and I think it is unnecessary controversy," said James English, president of Idaho Forest Industry Inc., which runs sawmills in and around Couer d'Alene, Idaho. The company has about 500 employees and annual sales of about $180 million.
"We are not a big company, and it will cost us some money up front, but over all the important thing is to be able to get into the Federal forest to get the timber," Mr. English said. "If we can eliminate this environmental conflict, pitting the environmental movement against us and using the road credits to do it, then I think it is best to get rid of them."
He said his company used to get almost a third of its timber from Forest Service land but it now gets only about 5 percent, as the Forest Service has cut back its sales in the area.
The Forest Service says the dollar value of the credits program has declined in recent years. In 1996 it was worth $41 million. In that year, timber companies bid $450 million for logs from the agency's forests.
The agreement does not, however, mean that no more roads will be built to haul timber from public lands. The Forest Service continues to have its own budget for building and maintaining roads. And timber companies will still build roads, using their own money, to take logging trucks and other equipment into the woods.

HEADLINE: PRIMARIES '98: THE OVERVIEW;
The Tried and True in California Triumph Over the Rich and New

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 3

 BODY:
Despite record spending by a handful of wealthy candidates, Californians embraced the established political order in their primary election on Tuesday and set the stage for a fall contest between two conventional career politicians, the Democratic Lieutenant Governor, Gray Davis, and the Republican State Attorney General, Dan Lungren.
But for all the signs of contentment with the status quo, voters sent a powerful signal of dissatisfaction with a long-standing feature of the once-renowned California public schools, decisively passing Proposition 227, a ballot measure to curtail three decades of bilingual instruction. The initiative was opposed by President Clinton and much of the state's educational establishment, and today a coalition of civil rights groups announced that it had filed suit to block it as unconstitutional. 
 Still, the overwhelming message was one of relative satisfaction in a state that has rebounded sharply from economic and natural disasters, with two-thirds of voters saying California was generally moving in the right direction, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls by The Los Angeles Times and CNN.
Mr. Davis defeated his richer Democratic rivals, who relied almost entirely on their personal fortunes to wage their campaigns, by a ratio of nearly 3 to 1, and even ran slightly ahead of Mr. Lungren, who faced no real opposition for his party's nomination Tuesday.
 A similar dynamic emerged in the race for the Republican Senate nomination, where the State Treasurer, Matthew Fong, staved off a self-financed $10 million challenge from Darrell Issa, a multimillionaire car alarm manufacturer, to win the right to challenge United States Senator Barbara Boxer. And in an election that drew only about 4 in 10 registered voters, a $20 million campaign by organized labor defeated Proposition 226, another ballot measure. Sponsored by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, it would have required unions to obtain written consent from members before using their dues for political purposes.
"I think collectively Californians are saying, 'Don't rock the boat,' " said Mark DiCamillo, director of the statewide Field Poll in San Francisco. "They do want to make some changes in the direction of the state, but pretty much they're not looking for radical change this year, and that has a lot to do with the health of the state's economy after years of problems. Cautious optimism is the byword now."
It was a striking comeback for Mr. Davis, 55. Just months ago his candidacy was dismissed by many party insiders and pundits, who argued that he could not hope to compete against Al Checchi, a multimillionaire businessman who was making his first run for elective office and spent some $40 million of his own money, the all-time record for a non-Presidential race in the United States. That worked out to about $59 a vote for Mr. Checchi, compared to about $5 a vote for Mr. Davis, who still managed to tie the old record of $9 million for spending in a primary here for governor. Representative Jane Harman spent about $16 million, most of it her own money, for about $24 a vote.
But Mr. Checchi's campaign was today widely viewed as a cautionary tale about the limits of seemingly limitless spending, and the risk that attacks on one rival in a three-candidate field can easily create an opening for the third candidate -- in this case, Mr. Davis.
Throughout the state, it was mostly a day of triumph for familiar faces, including former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., who won 59 percent of the vote to become mayor of Oakland without a runoff, and for former Representative Robert K. Dornan of Orange County, who easily defeated two Republicans to win the nomination to challenge Loretta Sanchez, the Democrat who defeated him in 1996 by just 984 votes.
The sole incumbent to lose his seat was Representative Jay Kim, a Republican from Diamond Bar who pleaded guilty last year to accepting illegal campaign donations and had to campaign long-distance from Washington, where he must wear an electronic surveillance device. He was defeated for the nomination by State Assemblyman Gary Miller.
"The amateur hour is over," Mark Mellman, a veteran Democratic pollsters said of the voters' preference for experienced politicians over untried newcomers.
With 99 percent of precincts reporting in unofficial returns, Mr. Davis had 1,880,030 votes, or 35 percent of the total in the state's new open primary, in which the names of all candidates appeared on the same ballot regardless of party. Mr. Lungren had 1,830,591 votes, or 34 percent, with Mr. Checchi trailing with 682,012, or 13 percent, just ahead of another self-financed millionaire, Ms. Harman of suburban Los Angeles, who drew 663,151 votes, or 12 percent.
Mr. Davis's strikingly strong finish could be a bad omen for Mr. Lungren, 51, a conservative former Congressman from Long Beach. Though Mr. Lungren enjoys support from the state's Republican establishment, he could not muster a stronger turnout, despite spending some $4 million, most of it on television advertising, in an effort to establish a presence against the Democrats' early attacks. At the same time, surveys of voters leaving the polls showed that nearly two-thirds think it is time for a change in control of the governor's office, which has been held by Republicans for the last 16 years, and for 24 of the past 32 years.
"I am overwhelmed by the vote last night," Mr. Davis told supporters at a brief Democratic unity rally this morning in downtown Los Angeles, at which Mr. Checchi and Ms. Harman both pledged their support in the fall campaign.
But he added: "I'm under no illusions. This will be a real challenge, and we'll be tested time and again."
In the Senate race, Mr. Fong, 43, the State Treasurer since 1995, defeated Mr. Issa by a margin of 22 percent to 19 percent, or 1,158,391 votes to 1,028,682. Ms. Boxer, the Democratic incumbent, drew more votes than both her rivals combined, or 2,322,517 for 44 percent of the total.
Overall, according to the voter surveys, Democrats appeared to turn out in higher numbers than Republicans, apparently energized by the campaign against the union dues ballot measure. Nearly 4 in 10 voters belonged to union households, according to The Los Angeles Times/CNN survey.
"That's just extraordinary union turnout," said Bill Carrick, a veteran Democratic strategist who worked for Ms. Harman this year and said he did not believe labor had turned out in such force here since a right-to-work measure was on the ballot 40 years ago.
In the state's last primary for governor, both parties turned out in equal numbers.
Mr. Davis's strategists, taking a gentle victory lap at the party rally this morning, said their surveys had shown throughout the year that Mr. Davis's 23 years' experience in state government, beginning as chief of staff to Mr. Brown, would resonate with voters. His challenge was to get his message ("Experience Money Can't Buy") out over the blizzard of Mr. Checchi's television commercials, many of which harshly attacked Ms. Harman.
"He was what the voters were looking for," said Mr. Davis's media consultant, David Doak. "Sometimes voters just get in a mood, and I told him months ago, 'They're in the mood for you.' "
The one thing voters seemed determined to change was the existing system of bilingual education, in which non-English speakers are taught basic subjects in their native tongue while also learning English. The program, a legacy of the civil rights movement of the 1960's, has been widely denounced as ineffective in preparing a huge new generation of immigrant children for the job market, and pre-election polls had shown majorities of all ethnic and racial groups supporting it, despite the opposition of much of the state's political leadership, including all four governor hopefuls.
The measure won 61 percent to 39 percent in unofficial returns, though black and Hispanic support for it fell below 50 percent. According to The Los Angeles Times/CNN survey, fewer than 4 in 10 Hispanic voters and just under half of blacks backed the measure, while nearly 6 in 10 Asian voters and nearly 7 in 10 whites supported it.
"We won a tremendous victory against overwhelming obstacles," said Ron K. Unz, a multimillionaire software entrepreneur from Silicon Valley who sponsored the measure, which would essentially limit non-English speakers to one intensive year of instruction. "The California immigrant population has also won a victory."
But this morning, a group of Hispanic and civil rights groups announced that they had already filed suit in San Francisco to block the measure as unconstitutional.
"Parents, including immigrant parents, should have the right to make basic choices about their children's education," said Deborah Escobedo, a lawyer with Multicultural Education, Training and Advocacy, one of the groups that sued today. "Proposition 227 takes away these basic rights."

HEADLINE: Federal Court Upholds City Zoning Law to Curb Sex Shops

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's efforts to mold New York City into his vision of a more civil metropolis received a major boost yesterday when a Federal appeals court upheld a zoning law intended to curtail and isolate the scores of X-rated businesses in the city.
Emboldened by language in the ruling that said the law "may be enforced forthwith," city officials quickly announced plans to dispatch inspectors to sex shops throughout the city's five boroughs, beginning this morning. But the officials were forced to rein in their ambitions just minutes later, after learning that the decision would not become official under Federal court rules for up to 21 days. 
 That technicality gave breathing room to lawyers for the sex shop owners in their increasingly desperate attempt to block the zoning law, which bans strip clubs and X-rated book and video shops from operating within 500 feet of residential areas, schools, day care centers, houses of worship -- or each other.
In its unanimous ruling yesterday, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that the free speech issues raised by the shop owners had been fully heard and upheld by New York's highest court and that there was no need for the Federal courts to conduct their own review.
But the lawyer for the shop owners said he would now ask the full appeals court to take up the issue. "I have never for a moment lost confidence in our constitutional claims and intend to pursue them all the way to the Supreme Court if I have to," said Herald Price Fahringer, who represents 107 adult-entertainment business owners.
But one more delay in the protracted legal battle did not still the joy of Mayor Giuliani and his aides, or of City Council members like Walter D. McCaffrey, who first proposed the ban.
Mr. Giuliani called the ruling a "particularly significant victory" in his ongoing "quality of life" campaign, and said it should silence critics who contended that the zoning law violated the First Amendment rights of owners.
"This would now be 13, 14, 15, about 16 or 17 separate judges who have looked over this plan and come to the determination that the plan is legal," he said, referring to the series of state and Federal court challenges that the law has faced since it was enacted in 1995.
In fact, the legal avenues available to the store and club owners are rapidly dwindling. While the owners can seek a hearing before the full panel of the Court of Appeals, such appeals are seldom accepted.
Their lawyers could then seek the intervention of the United States Supreme Court, but again there is no certainty that the nation's highest court would agree to hear the case. City officials said that the law would affect 146 of the city's 164 X-rated businesses, although civil and criminal proceedings may delay the closings by as much as a year.
"We expect that many of these establishments will realize that they have to shut down and will do so on their own," said Randy M. Mastro, Deputy Mayor for Operations. "This is the last dance for sex shops."
But some shop owners said they would adapt, not close.
For example, Richard Kunis, the owner of Manhattan Video on West 39th Street, has spent the last several weeks building shelves and accumulating horror movies, war movies and even family-oriented movies, including "On Golden Pond," "Oh God! Book II" and "Holiday Singalong With Mitch Miller."
And Milton Anthony, the owner of Billy's Topless, a bar in Chelsea, said bikinis would provide his performers with the legal cover to dance uninterrupted.
For the Giuliani administration and the City Council, the issue hinged on the impact that strip clubs and adult-entertainment shops have on the city's neighborhoods and economy, from Times Square and Chelsea to stretches of major boulevards in Queens.
"It's a simple proposition," Mr. Mastro said. "We want to keep sex shops away from our neighborhoods, away from our schools, away from our churches."
But the owners of adult-entertainment businesses and several gay rights groups have framed the debate as an attempt to stifle free speech, and, as one sex shop owner said, to "Giuliani-ize the city," eliminating or restricting legal and longstanding ventures that the Mayor finds distasteful.
"This is another example of the new New York City, which is increasingly authoritarian and repressive," said Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, which represents the store's customers.
As the dispute wended through the court system -- with the city prevailing at every turn -- it spawned curious sideshows along the way. In April, for example, 30 strippers and lap dancers staged a provocative protest in City Hall Park, where they and dozens of other demonstrators chanted: "Giuliani, scared of sex, who's he going to censor next?"
The Mayor also eagerly entered the fray. He recently told listeners to his weekly radio program that people who live near sex shops could hurt the businesses by photographing their customers; the suggestion prompted an outcry from civil rights advocates.
And some comments that the Mayor made at a news conference -- that the law would reduce the number of sex shops in the city to as few as 20 -- prompted the owners to charge that Mr. Giuliani actually intended to kill the adult-entertainment industry.
In writing yesterday's decision, Judge Jose A. Cabranes suggested that the Mayor's comments were isolated and did not significantly change the overall complexion of the city's plan, which includes more than 500 relocation sites for businesses that do not conform to the zoning laws. But the owners assert that the sites are impractical because they are in industrial zones in the far reaches of the city.
In a 27-page decision joined by Judges Ellsworth A. Van Graafeiland and Thomas J. Meskill, Judge Cabranes said the shop owners and their customers were not entitled to a new hearing in Federal court on the ground of free speech, given that the New York State Court of Appeals, the state's highest, had already rejected that argument in upholding the law's constitutionality last February.
The judge also found that the state appellate court had applied the same standards as those used by the Federal courts in assessing whether the city had provided enough alternative sites for the sex shops.
As news of the ruling reached City Hall, final victory seemed, for a few hours, to be within the city's grasp. Mr. Mastro, the Deputy Mayor, wielded an appropriate prop -- a baseball bat -- as he summoned reporters to his office to explain how the city would enforce the law.
"City inspectors will hit the ground running tomorrow morning," Mr. Mastro began, resting the bat on his shoulders. "They will be in all five boroughs over the next two weeks. They expect to complete inspections of all of the sex shops of the city."
The Deputy Mayor went on to say that any owner found to be in violation will receive a criminal summons and could face a $5,000 fine and 90 days in jail. He also said the city would file civil lawsuits to secure the shutting down of businesses that defy the law.
"This is the day that we have prepared for," Mr. Mastro said.
Minutes later, city officials learned that they would have to wait at least a few weeks more.
If nothing else, the pause gave Mr. Kunis of Manhattan Video more time.
"We've built all the shelving that's necessary," he said. "And we're prepared to fill the store with violence and horror to make it legal."

Enterprise Zones Named

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
The Brooklyn Navy Yard was among 12 sites in New York designated yesterday by Gov. George E. Pataki as enterprise zones.
The new zones were for areas of the state that had lost jobs because of military and defense cutbacks. Previously, the zones were designated simply because the areas were economically depressed. 
 Enterprise zones provide incentives to businesses like wage tax credits, employee tax credits, capital investment tax credits, sales and local tax relief as well as low-cost power agreements with utilities.
Now, there are about 100,000 New Yorkers employed at more than 2,000 businesses in the state's enterprise zones, which have attracted more than $2.7 billion in investments since 1987.
The other zones designated yesterday are in Clinton, Seneca, Oneida, Herkimer, Albany, Orange, Suffolk, Broome, Montgomery, Tioga, Onondaga and Chautauqua Counties. NICK RAVO

Internet Service Planned

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Bell Atlantic Corporation of Manhattan will offer high-speed Internet access in Washington, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia in September as it taps into demand for fast Internet connections.
Bell Atlantic will extend the service to the Hudson River area of New Jersey in October, and New York and Boston next year. It will sell the service to consumers and people who work at home for $70 to $190 a month for unlimited use. 
 Bell Atlantic said the technology it will use transmits information over phone lines as much as 250 times faster than the typical modem.
The move to provide high-speed Internet services follows the GTE Corporation, the No. 3 local phone company, which said in April that it would offer such services in 16 states. The Internet-access market will grow to $38 billion in 2002, from $6 billion last year, according to Forrester Research, a technology market data researcher.

HEADLINE: WEEKEND EXCURSION;
Appointment in Schuylkill County

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

DATELINE: POTTSVILLE, Pa.

 BODY:
For a fleeting moment, you are Julian English and the road is yours, roaring in a sleek Caddie through scenic highways of fact and fiction, past coal-patch taverns and slatty wood houses, gin cocktail parties and country clubs vibrating to the tunes of Tommy Lake's Royal Collegians.
The terrain is Schuylkill County, the shovel-shaped anthracite coal region of eastern Pennsylvania, which is barely disguised in the plentiful short stories and novels of John O'Hara, a hard-drinking and cultivated son of Pottsville. 
 O'Hara first imagined his "Pennsylvania protectorate," as he called it, from his retreat at the Pickwick Arms Hotel in Manhattan in 1933. Typing on a new portable typewriter with an all-black ribbon, he created a parallel world in "Appointment in Samarra," with its fictional county of Latenengo populated by the fashionable young married set of the whirling 1920's and a doomed small-town aristocrat named Julian English who ended his life in a sealed garage with his Cadillac running.
Known locally as "the Region," Schuylkill County lost its properous sheen of wealth with the decline, beginning in the 1940's, of the coal industry. Yet the territory remains a literary retreat; its melancholy history and early-19th-century architecture are still fresh characters in one of America's enduring examples of the "locale a clef."
The term is Matthew J. Bruccoli's whimsical description of vivid fictional settings with tap roots in reality, like William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha (Lafayette County, Miss.) Thomas Wolfe's Altamont (Ashville, N.C.) or Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg (Clyde, Ohio).
"Driving around Schuylkill County, I had a shock of recognition," said Mr. Bruccoli, O'Hara's biographer and an English professor at the University of South Carolina. "John O'Hara had not just mastered the details, but had managed to get everything right. He had done it in such a way that for people reading about his communities 60 years later, to make it possible for them to have not just an understanding but a feeling for place."
With its grand mansions ascending the hills of Mahantongo Street, Pottsville is the inspiration for O'Hara's fictional community, Gibbsville, Pa., featured in two other novels and many of the short stories. So were the surrounding Schuylkill towns that he rechristened with names like Swedish Haven, Mountain City and Taqua. His renderings in fiction were so precise that descriptions of each mythical town has a geographical twin on a map of Schuylkill County.
"It doesn't matter what fact you want to check out: it's there and he's telling you the truth about something and it wasn't just fiction," said Pamela MacArthur, a Canadian who has been meticulously exploring his descriptions for her doctoral thesis at the University of Sussex in England.
Ms. MacArthur said she had checked his references, from a description of the Lenape Indians to the style of a particular fence, and detected no flaws. "When he was being interviewed, he would say it's the novelist's idea," she said. "But when you come down to it, it was fact."
 
Son of a Surgeon
The oldest son of an affluent local surgeon, O'Hara was born here in 1905. He worked for two years as a reporter on The Pottsville Journal. In 1928 he left the area for a reporting job in New York. There, he began writing the first of his torrent of short stories that eventually totaled more than 400. "Appointment in Samarra," his first book, earned him success, notoriety and 10th place on the Publishers Weekly best-seller list.
O'Hara, who died in 1970, went on to write 13 more novels, most set outside the Region. Films were made of such works as "Butterfield 8," "Ten North Frederick," "From the Terrace" and "A Rage to Live." "Pal Joey" became a Broadway musical and a Hollywood film starring Frank Sinatra.
O'Hara's hometown, Pottsville, is the economic hub of Schuylkill County. A city of 16,000 people, it is dominated at its crest by an 18th-century stone courthouse and jail fortress, where six Irish Catholic "Molly Maguire" miners convicted of murdering a constable and a mine boss were hanged on June 21, 1877, a Thursday known as "The Day of the Rope."
Legend has it that Molly Maguire was an Irish widow unjustly evicted from her home, inspiring an anti-landlord movement in the early 19th century in Ireland. Irish miners here, who adopted the name in tribute to those rebels, were caught up in violent tensions that pitted miners against mining bosses, Catholics against Protestants, and Irish against Welsh, English, Scottish and German immigrant workers.
The county historical society at 14 North 3d Street still houses the original Molly Maguires trial transcripts, dated newspaper clippings and even hanks of the ropes that were used to hang the men. But I confess that my husband and I were drawn to a more unconventional museum, the imposing brick headquarters of Yuengling Brewery, with its vivid blue-and-white stained-glass ceiling and a dark wooden bar where beer samples are served in plastic cups. Through good times, it has supplied the local citizenry with local ales and during Prohibition with watered-down .05 percent alcohol brews labeled "near beer."
Founded in 1829 by a German immigrant, the brewery remains in Yuengling family hands, offering weekday tours and sample tastings of its stout Porter and Lord Chesterfield ale.
Just footsteps from the brewery is the graceful three-story Victorian townhouse at 606 Mahantongo, where O'Hara spent 12 years of his boyhood and young adult life. A prominent iron plaque marks the home, painted in gray-and-burgundy trim, but there are no tours of the interior, because the house has been carved into apartments.
 
A Fictional Double
Still, it doesn't take much to transport a dedicated reader from Mahantongo to its fictional double, Lantenengo Street, a gracious neighborhood of the coal-town upper crust that produced its most eligible brides. Across the street from O'Hara's home are the grand white pillars of the Braun School of Music. And rising up the hill are gingerbread Victorians with spacious porches and the Tudor Jacobean Revival mansion that housed three generations of Yuengling brewers.
Schuylkill County has always been a rather uneasy host to O'Hara's legacy. Today it is more likely to celebrate the memory of the rebellious immigrant Irish miners, who challenged their bosses, rather than O'Hara, who challenged the pretensions of the indulgent country club set. He described that group in "Appointment in Samarra" as "the spenders and drinkers and socially secure, who could thumb their noses and not have to answer to anyone except their families."
O'Hara's literature is rarely used as a teaching tool in the region, said Mark T. Major, a local historian and the executive director of the Schuylkill County's visitors bureau. "The Molly Maguires just seem more exciting, while John O'Hara isn't as popular," he said.
Excitement here is also the Pennsylvania Dutch Folk Festival, this year from June 26 through July 5, or the Molly Maguires weekend, from June 19 through 21. That event will feature a concert of the Irish Lads; a dramatic reading of the last words of the condemned men hanged in Pottsville, and a walking tour of Mahanoy City, in the footsteps of Irish and native firefighters who rioted in 1834.
"Usually we re-enact the murder of a Tamaqua policeman that led to the hanging of five Irish, but people were getting tired of it," Mr. Major added regretfully.
 
Of Sweets Past
Still, you don't need a formal festival to celebrate John O'Hara country when you can sample the sweetness of a peanut butter roll just like the ones the author savored in his youth. At Mootz Candies on South Centre Street in Pottsville, the third generation of the Mootz family is still stirring up coconut creams, porcupines, pink meltaways and black diamond coal candy, licorice that comes with its own coal bin.
We made our own homage to O'Hara by roaming through Schuylkill County in search of abandoned coal breakers and O'Hara-vintage country clubs where perhaps the throbbing urge of Gershwin music could still evoke the sensations of "a tea dance at the club and a girl in a long black satin dress," as he wrote in "Imagine Kissing Pete," a short story published in The New Yorker in the late 1930's.
At the Lakeside Ballroom in Barnesville, a country club where O'Hara's characters did indeed toss down rye cocktails, the orchestra wasn't vibrating with Gershwin tunes. But we did stumble into a "Polka Blast" in full explosion, with members of the Polka Family band serenading the Coal Crackers Polka Association below a deep blue simulated sky and a whirling mirrored ball.
After a vigorous polka workout, we retreated to the refuge of Mahanoy City, a small town that was once home to an old German brewery that produced Kaier's beer and, of course, the firemen's riot. The brewery has long since closed, but the Victorian mansion built and inhabited by Charles D. Kaier and his heirs is now an opulent bed and breakfast with parquet floors, marble fireplaces, chestnut wainscotting and 12-foot-high ceilings.
 
Mining and Beer
The beer baron's mansion is within easy touring distance of several museums that dwell on the region's coal-mining past. In Ashland, visitors to Pioneer Tunnel can take an underground tour of a horizontal drift mine that runs 1,800 feet into the side of Mahanoy Mountain. And about a half-hour drive from Mahanoy City, in neighboring Carbon County, is Eckley Miners' Village, a 19th-century coal patch, or company town. Eckley's wooden houses have been preserved by the state and were featured in the 1969 movie "The Molly Maguires," with Sean Connery and Richard Harris.
During most of our journey, we found ourselves simply touring the map of O'Hara's Pennsylvania protectorate, although at a much more leisurely speed than the author's character, Julian English, who drove as if he really did own the road.
We passed through Cressona and Pine Grove, Tamaqua and Frackville, each with a matching literary double in the pages of O'Hara's literature. We traveled with a library copy of "Gibbsville, Pa." and "Appointment in Samarra," the latter a Modern Library edition with yellowing pages and delicate text bookmarked at a literary guarantee from O'Hara: "How much of this novel is all true? It's all true, a rather pompous remark that needs extending."

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
Perfect Plan: Kill My Wife. Please.

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
You don't have to believe a word of the strained dialogue in "A Perfect Murder" to be seduced by the movie's chilly high-gloss ambiance and its skillfully plotted update of Frederick Knott's play (and Alfred Hitchcock's film) "Dial M For Murder."
One vicarious fantasy the movie gratifies is inhabiting a jaw-droppingly elegant Fifth Avenue apartment with a spectacular spiral staircase and a glorious view of Central Park. (And the movie lets you wallow around in the place just long enough so you begin to feel at home.) Another is that the truly rich who can afford such grandeur must be truly dissatisfied. (Their good fortune would be unbearable otherwise.) Steven and Emily Taylor, the attractive childless couple who live in this palace, fit the bill perfectly. 
 As the movie opens, Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow) is cavorting in bed with a handsome young painter named David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen) in his Brooklyn warehouse loft. Little does she know that her lover is a ruthless con man and gigolo operating under a false name who has spent many years in prison. Nor is she aware that her husband (Michael Douglas), a shady Wall Street bond salesman, is about to lose his shirt as one of his Asian schemes goes bust. Even worse, her husband has discovered her clandestine affair and compiled a devastating dossier on David that he is planning to use against them both at the appropriate moment.
Steven could be the Gordon Gekko of "Wall Street" a decade later. The thrill of the chase has drained away, and all that's left is a panicked psychopathic acquisitiveness. Mr. Douglas, who with each film looks more like a wattled, riled-up rooster, makes Steven a pleasure to loathe. When he approaches David with a cash offer of $500,000 to murder his wife (Emily is independently wealthy, and the Taylors have no prenuptial agreement) and make it look as though she were slain by an intruder, Steven descends from villain into monster.
To describe any more of the plot, which departs significantly from its source, would be to give too much away. But the story has enough nasty twists and tantalizing clues for its ingenious mechanics to remain engaging. Where the 1954 version starring Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings had the clunky feeling of a filmed play, this update, directed by Andrew Davis from a screenplay by Patrick Smith Kelly, is much more fluent and sensuous. Its vision of late-90's Manhattan as a luxurious shark tank filled with chic cold fish is quite similar to the picture of the city drawn by "The Devil's Advocate."
Ultimately, the sleekness of "A Perfect Murder" can't conceal the fact that its characters are stick figures in an elaborate three-way game featuring two cats and one very wiley mouse. Of the three, Ms. Paltrow's Emily is the most problematic. Although the movie halfheartedly tries to portray her as a damsel in distress, that effort doesn't wash.
This resourceful late-90's career woman, who works as a translator at the United Nations, is no helpless blushing victim of male skulduggery. She may not be quite as cunning as her husband, but she is just as deceitful. And Ms. Paltrow, whose air is far too worldly for her to be a convincing ingenue, gives her character a crisp professional edge.
Pursuing her suspicions of a murder plot against her, Emily fearlessly ventures into a seamier section of Brooklyn where she charms a sinister drug dealer by using her linguistic skills. When seeking privileged information about her husband's financial status, she knows exactly where to go and whom to talk to.
Mr. Mortensen has the movie's richest role as the duplicitous painter who is coerced into agreeing to murder his lover. In the scenes in which he is supposed to appear sympathetic, he insinuates enough surliness to give his character a disquieting undertone of potential violence. But once David has been established as a rat, the actor shows flashes of pained regret for having to kill a woman he half loves.
Money, money, money. The creepiest aspect of "A Perfect Murder" is that there really is no contest between love and money. The movie is right in tune with the icy Darwinian mood fostered by the booming late-90's economy. In a climate like this, the hottest sex in the world doesn't stand a chance against the possibility of raking in a quick half-million.
"A Perfect Murder" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, strong language and a gory murder sequence.

Prices Off Sharply on New Signs The Economy Remains Strong

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices dropped sharply yesterday, hurt by new signs of American economic strength and a surprise increase in interest rates by the Bank of England.
 Anxiety that today's May employment report from the Labor Department might disclose further economic vitality also undermined the bond market. 
 The 30-year bond fell 18/32, to a price of 104 11/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.82 percent, from 5.78 percent on Wednesday.
"The bond market has rallied quite noticeably recently because of the exemplary inflation performance, the budget surplus, a strong dollar, continued distress in Asia, a flight to quality from overseas investors, and an expectation of slower economic growth in the second quarter," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. "But the market's improved tone hit a sour note today on signs of continued buoyant consumer spending, strong factory orders and inventories, and skittishness in front of tomorrow's labor market statistics."
Factory orders rose 1.2 percent in April to near forecasts for a 1.6 percent gain, while first quarterly productivity numbers increased to 1.1 percent from 0.2 percent.
Mr. Fine said the labor market data due today will likely set the tone for the financial markets until June 10, when the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, delivers his testimony to the Joint Economic Committee in Congress.
The Bank of England's decision to raise interest rates by one-quarter point, to 7.5 percent, also hurt the Treasury market by raising yields on British debt securities, making them more competitive.
Nonetheless, Dennis Hynes, chief market strategist and managing director of R. W. Pressprich & Company, a New York broker-dealer, said he did not see the increase having much of an impact on the United States market.

HEADLINE: Will the Fed Follow London's Lead?

 BODY:
The economies of the United States and Britain have moved in surprisingly similar ways in recent years, whether by coincidence or because both freed their economies in the 1980's. Now Britain's central bank has stunned observers by raising interest rates, posing the question whether the Federal Reserve will be the next to do so.
The Bank of England boosted its base lending rate yesterday by a quarter of a percentage point, to 7.5 percent. It said it had acted because of concerns that wages were rising too rapidly and consumer spending was so brisk that a revival of inflation was a serious threat. 
 Nearly all British economists who monitor the Bank of England -- 19 of 20, according to a poll by Bloomberg News -- had expected the central bank to leave rates unchanged. That was largely because of signs that Britain's economy is slowing, particularly in exports. Both stock and bond prices fell in London after the bank's move was announced.
There are obvious differences between the United States and Britain, but current economic arguments in both countries are surprisingly similar. There are inflationary pressures in the American labor market, about which more will be known today when the employment figures for May are released, and consumer spending has been very strong. But inflation does not look like much of a threat when commodity prices are falling and there is fear that Asian weakness could slow the economy here. So the Fed has not taken any action.
At the March meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee, some Fed officials voiced fears that raising rates "could produce an outsize and undesirable response in financial markets." But if Britain's stock market remains buoyant after the Bank of England's move, that might strengthen the hand of those who want the Fed to take a similar step.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Heavy Buying in Blue Chips Sends Dow Up 66.76 Points

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market rebounded yesterday, as investors were soothed by reports that the economy remains resilient and merger activity is still vibrant..
A day after the Dow Jones industrial average fell 87.44 points, heavy buying of blue-chip issues helped the Dow climb 66.76 points, or about eight-tenths of a percent, to close at 8,870.56. 
 Broader measures were even stronger. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.1 percent to close at 1,094.83 and the Nasdaq composite soared 1.6 percent, to 1,769.95.
Yesterday's gain, though, still leaves most major stock indexes far off their all-time highs. And Motorola's warning, after the close of trading yesterday, that its second-quarter earnings would probably not meet analysts' expectations may deal Wall Street a still sharper blow.
"We're going through a correction phase," said Hugh Johnson, a market strategist at the First Albany Corporation. "We're having some big up-and-down days in a largely direction-less market."
While Motorola's warning may be another sign that profit growth is weakening this year, and that Asia remains a concern, the United States economy continues to expand..
Yesterday, for instance, the Commerce Department said that factory orders were brisk in April and that retail sales in May were the strongest in more than four years.
As a result, the shares of retail outlets like Wal-Mart, the Gap and Circuit City were in heavy demand yesterday, sending shares of those companies sharply higher. But investors were also keen on oil and technology issues.
Oil shares climbed along with oil prices on expectations that Saudi Arabia and other oil producing states would agree to reduce oil production and thereby lift oil prices. When an agreement to cut oil production by 450,000 barrels a day came yesterday, the price of a barrel of oil rose 2 percent.
Telecommunications stocks also soared after Alcatel, the Paris-based maker of telephone equipment, said it would acquire the DSC Communications Corporation of Plano, Tex., for about $4.4 billion in stock.
A day earlier, Tellabs Inc., another equipment maker, said it would purchase the Ciena Corporation for about $6.9 billion. That kind of merger activity sent the shares of other telephone equipment and networking stocks sharply higher yesterday on speculation that there could be more telephone combinations.
Yesterday's gains come in the midst of a broader slump in the stock market, one that had seen the Dow fall 4.4 percent from its record high, posted May 13, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq drop 9.1 percent off its all-time high of 1,917.61, set on April 22.
There has been a concern among investors that share prices got ahead of corporate earnings prospects, that shares are vastly overpriced and that inflation could increase this year because of rising wage pressures.
But the counterpoint, according to many analysts, has been a near-perfect landscape of strong economic growth, low interest rates a whirlwind of merger and acquisition activity, and an apparently burning desire by people everywhere to buy and own stocks.

HEADLINE: U.N. Arms Experts Brief Security Council on Iraqi Compliance

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 4

 BODY:
Four months after Secretary General Kofi Annan stepped in and took charge of a crisis with Iraq, the initiative in dealing with the Government of President Saddam Hussein moved back this week to the Security Council and the commission charged with destroying Iraq's prohibited weapons.
Two days of technical briefings on the information that Iraq has been withholding from arms inspectors ended today with Richard Butler, the Special Commission's executive chairman, preparing to go to Baghdad with a list of steps Iraq must take if sanctions are to be lifted. 
 Mr. Butler's visit next week will put the onus on Baghdad to meet the requirements or explain in better detail why it cannot. He will report back to the Council.
At a news conference this afternoon, Mr. Butler said that if Iraq answered the outstanding questions and met demands for material and information, the Security Council could move a long way in lifting the eight-year embargo during the next major review, in October, of Iraqi compliance.
"There are some items on this list that could be done in a day if we were given the document or the piece of information we need," Mr. Butler said. "I did not say this will be over by October. But I could foresee a report that was very different from any previous report."
Diplomats who attended the marathon Security Council briefings, which focused on missing documents and Iraqi concealment policies, said that the opinions of the two most entrenched sides -- the United States and Britain on one side and Russia, France and China on the other -- had not changed.
But these diplomats also said that "neutral" countries in the 15-member Council were impressed by the depth of information they were offered and the apparent flexibility the inspectors had shown in meeting Council questions and acknowledging that there might never be 100 percent compliance in some areas.
"This is not always a black or white picture, but a picture that has all shades," said Danilo Turk, the representative of Slovenia, which holds a rotating Council seat.
"The presentation was very interesting to the members of the Security Council who usually don't have access to technical information," he said, speaking of smaller nations. "We of course receive reports, which are more summary in character, and it's not the same thing. Now we are able to learn a bit more about the technical aspects."
Celso L. N. Amorim, Brazil's delegate, who had pressed for a technical briefing and a "road map" to help Iraqis understand what they must do, called Mr. Butler's list "a good starting point." But, he said, "the details will have to be filled in with the cooperation of Iraq."
British and American officials hope that the possession of fuller information will steer some wavering countries away from a movement to end sanctions soon and will persuade them to be wary of Iraqi claims to have met all the demands of the Council.
At his news conference today, Mr. Butler used the example of a dispute over unaccounted for imported missile fuels that experts say can be used only on Scud-type engines, which are prohibited.
"Some Iraqi authorities have attempted to leave Council members with the idea that these fuels aren't unique, that they could be useful in other Iraqi missile engines, those that they are allowed to have because the missile would fly less that 150 kilometers," Mr. Butler said. "That is not true, and I think the Council now understands that it is not true."
The document Mr. Butler will take to Baghdad next week for discussion on June 13 and 14 with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz lists only in general terms the areas of biological, chemical and missile programs that need to be addressed. It contains no new revelations, and is sketchiest on the biological weapons file, which arms inspectors say is their most difficult and worrisome area.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Trade Panel Backs Europe On Tariffs

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, June 4

 BODY:
European Union nations can continue to impose tariffs on United States computer-networking equipment exports ahead of a July 1, 2000, deadline for eliminating all such tariffs, a trade arbitration appeals panel said today.
The ruling by a World Trade Organization appeals board is a blow to companies like Cisco Systems, Bay Networks and Cabletron Systems that want to sell their products at lower prices in European markets. 
 The decision, disclosed in an European Union document, "reversed all the substantial findings" of an earlier ruling that favored the United States. The European Union had appealed that ruling by the Geneva-based trade arbiter in February.
"We are disappointed with the appellate body's report," said Jay Ziegler, spokesman for the United States trade representative's office. "However, the commercial impact will be limited because the E.U. eliminated tariffs across all these products by the year 2000," he said.
The tariff dispute dates back to 1994, when the Europeans agreed to cut tariff rates on all types of computer equipment. British and Irish customs authorities subsequently began to reclassify networking equipment as telecommunications equipment and reclassified one type of computer as a television receiver. Tariffs almost doubled on these products as a result. Since 1995, other European Union member states have reclassified and raised tariffs.
Cisco Systems, the world's largest maker of data networking equipment, derived 29 percent of its bookings from Europe for the quarter ended in April.
Cisco's European business, which grew rapidly last year, has slowed recently as large businesses diverted spending to prepare for the switch to a single currency.
Analysts said that while the decision was not good news for Cisco or other American exporters, its impact would be minimal on the company's European sales. "Any tariff would be a problem," said Jim Wade, an analyst at BT Alex. Brown, who rates Cisco a "buy."
Still, there isn't a lot of competition from European companies that might undercut Cisco's prices, Mr. Wade said.
In 1997, the European Union agreed to eliminate tariffs on all electronics products by July 1, 2000. The United States has not yet benefited from the agreement because the European Union has continued to impose higher interim tariff rates for much of the equipment.
The United States took its case to the W.T.O. in November 1996. A settlement dispute body of the organization established a panel in February 1997 to look at the complaint and those against Ireland and Britain.

HEADLINE: Gains Continue, as Retailers Post 7.1% Rise in Sales

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
American retailers continued an impressive growth spurt last month, one that bodes well for coming company earnings.
Sales in retail stores open at least a year rose 7.1 percent in May, according to the Goldman Sachs Retail Composite Index. 
 Retailers, which have not benefited much from the robust American economy in the last few years, were finally enjoying the results of strong consumer spending. May's 7.1 percent increase in retail sales followed on the heels of a very strong April, when sales rose 10.2 percent and one of the largest monthly gains in a decade.
And many retail analysts think that the buying might not end soon. "The beat goes on," said Richard N. Baum, a retail analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The month was an extension of what has been going on all year. We have still got the same story with the leading indicators. Average hourly earnings are up a little over 3 percent. Housing turns are up 15 percent. The fact that you have some pay- down on consumer debt is producing personal expenditures."
Retailers were able to sell a lot of their merchandise for full price last month, which means that profit margins might be stronger than expected when earnings are reported in July.
"We are raising our earnings estimates for a lot of retailers," said Jeffrey M. Feiner, an analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc.
From T-shirts to curtains to lawn mowers to patio furniture, Americans continued their love affair with discount merchants.
Sales at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. rose 11 percent in May compared with May 1997, and the Kmart Corporation said its sales gained 6.9 percent last month. Dollar General, which serves mostly lower-income communities, said sales rose 14.4 percent, and Target, a discount chain for middle-class shoppers, reported a 7.4 percent gain.
"The strength remains in discount and specialty apparel," Mr. Baum said.
Indeed, a variety of clothing stores saw a healthy rise in sales during May. The Gap said sales soared 24 percent, with huge gains in all of its stores, including Old Navy and Banana Republic. Talbots Inc. said sales jumped 13 percent. Even The Limited, which has had several tough years, reported a sales gain of 9 percent.
Department stores, which have trailed the rest of the industry all year, came in behind other stores again. Sales at Federated Department Stores Inc., for example, gained 1.8 percent and the J. C. Penney Company reported a mere four-tenths of a percent increase. The Dayton Hudson Corporation's same-store sales rose 6.1 percent, largely because of its Target unit.
The luxury department stores offered exceptions to the lackluster department store sales. Sales at Neiman Marcus, a Harcourt General unit, rose 9.6 percent, and Saks Holdings Inc., which operates Saks Fifth Avenue, said sales rose 3.7 percent.
These stores may be benefiting from the first real hemline change in several years as apparel makers have been churning out skirts just below the knee and longer.
Market prognosticators should take note: according to Wall Street folklore, the market goes the way of hemlines. But perhaps another hot seller this spring -- short pants like pedal pushers and clam diggers -- will compensate.
Sales among merchants of home furnishings and computers also rose. Same-store sales at Pier 1 Imports Inc. rose 7.1 percent and the Bombay Company reported gains of 18 percent. Circuit City said sales rose 12 percent and Sears, Roebuck & Company reported sales increases of 5.4 percent, citing higher sales of consumer electronics, appliance and home-improvement products.

HEADLINE: Commerce Can Do the Job

BYLINE: By William M. Daley; William M. Daley is the Secretary of Commerce.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Senate Intelligence Committee began its hearings this week on the American satellites launched by Chinese rockets. Among the issues are whether our export control laws were violated and whether private companies committed illegal acts in the aftermath of the 1996 Loral rocket launch in China. Those specific charges should be investigated thoroughly, and if there was any wrongdoing it should be punished.
But it is simply untrue to suggest that the 1996 transfer of jurisdiction over communications satellites to the Commerce Department from the State Department jeopardized national security. In fact, that transfer completed a process begun by President George Bush in 1990 and encouraged by Congress. In 1990 and 1992, Congress passed legislation that would have transferred this jurisdiction, but the bills failed to become law because of other controversial provisions. 
 The transfer brought the United States into line with the licensing approach used by every other satellite producer in the world. Every satellite license the Commerce Department approved has had the unanimous approval of the reviewing agencies -- the State and Defense Departments as well as the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency -- and has been subject to the same level of technology safeguards as satellites licensed at the State Department. It has been made clear to exporters that under the license they could not transfer any rocket technology to a foreign country. Any such transfer still requires a license from the State Department.
Beginning in 1990, the Bush Administration reviewed items on the Munitions List, which required a State Department export license, to see if they should be moved to the Commodity Control List, which required a Commerce Department license. In President Bush's words, he wanted to make "export license decisions more predictable and timely."
The differences between the two are procedural. The Commerce Department must meet firmer deadlines for decisions on "dual use" items (those with commercial as well as military applications) and must include all relevant Federal agencies.
Yes, economic considerations play a role. Exports bring in billions of dollars and account for millions of American jobs, and the strength of our technology industries is critical to national security.
But contrary to what some have asserted, the Commerce Department's method of licensing is every bit as thorough and careful as that used by the State Department to regulate munitions. Satellite exports are governed by an executive order issued by President Clinton in December 1995, which gives these agencies the right to participate in the decision on any license application.
If there is disagreement, then cases move quickly to a committee of senior officials from these departments and agencies, which votes on the application. If the Pentagon, say, is unhappy with the outcome, it can take the case to the President -- although such an appeal has never happened. Today, reviews of dual use licenses are more thorough and more careful than at any time in the past.
The broader issue is how our Government should regulate exports of high-technology goods. The most important issue is, as it should be, our national security.
But imposing the tightest possible restrictions on high-tech exports is not necessarily the best way to protect our security. In fact, our current policy -- developed under the Reagan and Bush Administrations -- recognizes that we must consider various factors in controlling high-technology exports.
The United States has a monopoly over very few technologies. Therefore, rigid export controls would not protect national security in a growing number of situations because the same products can be obtained readily from foreign sources.
Indeed, such controls would harm American security. Our high-tech companies would become less competitive globally, making them less able to produce the innovative products that our military and private businesses depend on. And to avoid export controls, some companies would undoubtedly move their research and manufacturing outside of the United States.
Take high-performance computers. These machines are essential to a modern military, but the Pentagon and American businesses do not buy enough of them to maintain a thriving domestic industry.
Without exports, the industry would be crippled, and in the long term, it would be unable to plow profits back into developing the next generation of even more powerful computers.
In short, we must consider the full ramifications of our decisions -- including the costs of ill-reasoned controls that damage our technology base without protecting national security.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
He Didn't Do It Alone

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL; Beginning today, A. M. Rosenthal's column will appear once a week, on Fridays.

 BODY:
Bill Clinton did not do it all by himself.
Beneath the scandals about the Clinton Administration's betrayal of democracy in China, its abandonment of human rights as an international priority, its strengthening of Chinese missile forces with American money and engineering, its acceptance of campaign funds from Beijing and its carefully blind eye toward the Chinese sales of nuclear technology that suddenly bring the threat of war in Asia -- beneath all that is the fact that he got all the help he needed, from America's own political, economic and intellectual leadership. 
 Sometimes it arrived with instructions on what to do or not do. But Mr. Clinton, famous fast learner, soon did not need instruction kits.
The American public was generally uncaring, passive or supportive, in the inane belief that his betrayals and appeasement policies were creating huge profits for the U.S. Beijing was amused, and piled up a $50 billion trade surplus over the U.S.
The American public cannot absolve itself of appeasement responsibility and just enjoy the shame of Bill Clinton, assuming he feels any. Americans have to make sure that investigations and hearings continue even if they lead to jail for those who took Chinese money and impeachment for those who permitted it.
And Americans have the responsibility to remember that even more hurtful to their country than dirty money are dirty policies, and that their own society enabled Mr. Clinton to create and commit them. Otherwise it will all happen again in this and the next Presidency.
We will have plenty of chances to show we remember, starting now. Administration decisions to help Chinese technology carry missiles to target and to ignore Chinese dispatch of nuclear technology to Pakistan led India to prove its own nuclear capabilities by testing them.
Indians dropped huge hints to let Washington know in advance, but the poor fellows failed. The stunning U.S. ineptitude showed that the surveillance on which the no-testing treaty depends sometimes would not work. It showed too that determined nations could put together all the makings of nuclear bombs, without any testing.
Some knowledgeable supporters of the treaty say it has lost credibility as an anti-nuclear safeguard. All right, then: Should we tickle ourselves into believing the treaty is our protection or at last go for antiballistic missile defense? All opposed to that defense please raise hands; now tell us what you offer that could substitute for both ABM and the anti-testing mirage.
Presidential campaign time is not coming -- it's here. Will we get candidates who will face the truth about appeasement of China? Not likely, unless the U.S. public fights hard -- because for both parties it has been an embarrassingly bipartisan path.
Al Gore, I think, can win or lose the Presidency depending on whether he repudiates or sticks to the Clintonian China policies. Mr. Gore, do you think, as Samuel Berger, the national political-security adviser, lectures us with straight face, that selling China missile technology is real good for America? What job do you plan for him?
Will you support the ugly campaign of the Administration and the U.S.-China lobbies to castrate in the Senate the House bill that puts at least some American influence into fighting persecution of Christians in China and some Muslim countries? Or will you risk Mr. Clinton's anger by supporting an effective bill -- before the Senate vote?
And will we let Republican candidates get away with not repudiating the Reagan and Bush licensing of missile help for China?
Money: taking political contributions from the Communist apparatus is moral treachery, at least. Yes -- and U.S. businesses and economic lobbies ceaselessly manipulate and despoil our political life by using scores of millions of dollars to buy the services of U.S. politicians for the China lobbies.
Are we mad? That is a possible answer.
If not, Clinton appeasement has become so obviously against U.S. interests and democratic morality that maybe Americans will do our duty: expose and fight that policy, as long as we have breath or print.

HEADLINE: Venice Journal;
A Gondola (as It Were) Built for 2,600, Plus Crew

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: VENICE, June 1

 BODY:
The Grand Princess twice the size of the Titanic -- sailed into port on Sunday night and seemed to eclipse even the cupola of St. Mark's Cathedral. As passengers spilled out to inspect the canals of Venice, most of Venice stared, awestruck, at the world's largest cruise ship.
"It's the newest and the biggest," Marguerite Salomone of Monterey, Calif., said, explaining why she and her husband, Alfonso, had signed up a year ahead for a 12-day Mediterranean cruise on an untested ship carrying 2,600 passengers. "Anything new is always better." She paused. Then, looking at the long walk to the elevator, she added, "I'm not sure bigger is better, though." 
 But that is exactly what Princess Cruises' parent company, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company of Britain, is betting on.
The company has ordered two sister ships for the Grand Princess -- which will also be able to carry 109,000 gross tons -- from the Italian shipbuilding company Fincantieri. One Peninsular's chief rivals, Royal Caribbean, plans to launch two even larger ships next year that will each carry 136,000 tons and accommodate 3,100 passengers. Until the launching of the Grand Princess, the biggest cruise ship ever built, the Carnival Destiny, had carrying capacity of 101,000 tons.
Disney has also ordered two huge cruise ships from Fincantieri, whose shipyards are so busy that deliveries were delayed this March, forcing Disney to cancel all its cruises for four months and offer refunds to about 90,000 people.
The cruise industry, boosted first by the hit television show "The Love Boat" and more recently by the movie "Titanic," has calculated that bigger ships provide economies of scale. And it thinks it can draw in more passengers with ever more varied and baroque forms of entertainment.
The Grand Princess, which cost $450 million and is 50 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty, has three grand dining rooms, seven casual restaurants and cafes and 12 bars.
It has three theaters offering a dizzying mix of cabaret and Las Vegas-style variety shows and comedy acts (Alan King and Red Buttons were the headliners for the maiden trip), a discotheque with a glass skywalk, a casino, five swimming pools, putting golf and a game room with virtual-reality rides, including deep-sea exploration.
There is even a kind of virtual-reality medical unit, with satellite hookups that allow ships' doctors to consult specialists at Cedar Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. There is also a wedding chapel, which also offers a "vows renewal" service. There are no provisions for burials at sea, however.
The Grand Princess is less a ship than a floating amusement park; the strongest hint that it is a descendant of the old stately ocean liners are the rarely used shuffleboard sets on a few of its 18 decks.
Most of the passengers are repeat customers lured by novel amenities, not by Leonardo DiCaprio.
"Our clients signed up long before the movie came out, and have been on Princess cruises before," Stephanie Woods, 28, an assistant cruise director, said. "But you can tell they have seen the movie: they pay more attention during the safety drills." (The Grand Princess, unlike the Titanic, has enough lifeboats to accommodate passengers and crew.)
The scheduled maiden voyage of the Grand Princess, leaving from Southampton, England, on May 14, was canceled at the last minute when the company decided that some of the fixtures and fittings were not up to standard, and offered refunds to passengers who had paid between $4,000 to $10,000 each. Company directors were haunted by the public relations disaster that afflicted Cunard when the QE2 began its first cruise of the 1994 season before refitting work was completed. QE2 passengers complained of exploding toilets and brown water.
Passengers who left Istanbul on May 26 on the Grand Princess, and made stops in Turkey, Greece and Italy (the cruise ends in Barcelona on June 6), reported some glitches, like dripping air-conditioners and malfunctioning laundromats, but there were few deep-felt complaints.
Mostly, passengers acted like old hands lending their experience to a virgin ship. "The food isn't quite up to par yet," Bernice Mehrbrodt, 67, of Santa Barbara, Calif., confided as she inspected the menu in the 500-seat Leonardo da Vinci restaurant, decorated with frescos of Madonnas. "But it's the first time out, and there are always a few kinks. We're having a wonderful time."
She and her husband paid $8,500 for their cruise package, including meals and shows. Passengers pay extra for their alcohol, onshore excursions and such niceties as massages and spa treatments.
Four cruise veterans who were admiring the roofs of Venice from a glassed-in nook of the discotheque compared notes on past and present voyages.
John Clark of Toronto sailed on the German liner the Bremen in 1932 and shared a dining-room table with the King of Saudi Arabia aboard the Spanish liner Queen Anna Maria in 1966. He expressed some scorn for the more middle-class cruises prevalent today. "I am 92," he explained grumpily. "The only trip that will take me is a cruise."
His companions were more impressed by the world's biggest cruise ship, but also expressed some wistfulness of scale. "I'm glad we came," said Jacqueline Smith, 74, of Fort Worth. "I'm having the best time I've ever had. But secretly, I think I like the smaller ships better."

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "A Floating Feast"
The Grand Princess is the largest cruise ship in the world and with a price tag of roughly $450 million it is also the most expensive one ever built. Each day the ship feeds its 2,600 passengers 852 pounds of shellfish, 1,170 pounds of potatoes, 1,600 pounds of beef and 200 pounds of salt. Here is a closer look at some other activities that are keeping the passengers busy between meals during the 12-day maiden voyage, which began on May 26.
 
1 -- Sky-walkers nightclub hangs 18 decks high above the sea.
 
2 -- A virtual-reality center is like an amusement park on the ship. Its virtual roller coaster offers passengers another reason to take their Dramamine.
 
3 -- The Calypso Reef and Pool is one of the five pools on board but the only one under a retractable glass dome.
 
4 -- The Princess Links includes a nine-hole putting course and a full- course simulator.
 
5 -- The Atlantis Casino is the largest at sea. The ceiling changes every half-hour mimicking the changes in the sky.
 
6 -- Princess Theater seats 748 people for a variety of shows.
 
7 -- The spa and tennis courts includes a Center Court Bar.
 
8 -- The Promenade deck encircling the ship is about one-third of a mile around.

HEADLINE: Swiss Banks Said to Offer Holocaust Payment

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
Switzerland's three major commercial banks have offered a settlement totaling more than $1 billion to end suits brought by Holocaust victims and their survivors who contend that the banks failed to return their assets after World War II, according to people familiar with the negotiations.
The offer, made late last week, days before the New York State Banking Department was scheduled to decide whether to approve the merger of the New York branches of two of the banks, the Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation, to form the world's third largest bank. 
 The Banking Board approved the merger today, after declaring that the Swiss institutions had undergone a "sea change in their attitude" and had opened long-secret records that enabled bank inspectors to trace accounts that had been dormant.
The World Jewish Congress, a pivotal negotiator in the tense talks between the banks and Holocaust survivors, offered no objections today, another sign that settlement negotiations are making rapid progress.
Negotiations between those two banks and the third, Credit Suisse, as well as lawyers for more than 40,000 plaintiffs and Jewish groups, will resume on Friday at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York.
In a conference call this afternoon run by Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs, all sides appeared to be moving toward an agreement that could total $1.6 billion or more. During the call lawyers for the banks said the chief executives of the major Swiss banks would be available, by telephone, to participate in the talks.
But it seems quite unlikely that a final deal will be struck for several weeks. "There is a lot of haggling remaining," said one person at the talks, which are under rules of strict confidentiality. "And it's always possible that things could fall apart."
In March the Swiss banks reversed their previous stance and agreed to negotiate a global settlement for all the Holocaust suits. Today it appeared that a settlement would include several elements.
The plaintiffs in the class-action suit, which is meant to include all surviving Holocaust victims and many of their heirs, could receive more than $1 billion. Several hundred million dollars -- up to $600 million by some accounts -- would go to a fund intended chiefly for indigent Holocaust survivors, including those who had no deposits in Swiss banks.
And there would be a "rough justice" fund for settlements with survivors and heirs who could show that their families had some money in Swiss banks but could not produce exact records.
The shape of the deal is under negotiation, however, and one person close to the talks said, "Getting the two sides to come to an agreement may be easier than getting the claimants to agree with each other or getting the Swiss to agree with each other."
The banks have a clear incentive to settle. Their business in the United States has been harmed by the threat of sanctions in New York City and California.
But the Swiss National Bank, Switzerland's central bank, has refused to take part in settlement talks. A Swiss historical commission and the State Department, which issued a final report this week on Nazi gold issues, have determined that the Swiss National Bank accepted the vast majority of the gold looted by the Nazis, including gold taken from the homes and, sometimes, the bodies of Holocaust victims.
The gold was smelted into bars to hide its origin and pay for war materiel for the German military, the State Department report said.
This week lawyers representing the Holocaust victims said that they planned to sue the Swiss National Bank this week. But today they decided to postpone that move, hoping to reach a settlement with the private banks first. Such an agreement would add to the pressure on the Swiss Government to reach a parallel settlement.
The merger approval from the New York Banking Department is a victory for the banks, which agreed to make some extraordinary changes.
The Acting Superintendent of Banks, Elizabeth McCaul, said in an interview today that the banks had allowed inspectors to review records of the banks' activities in the United States during the war, including records of accounts that could have belonged to Holocaust victims. Some were found in storage upstate.
For the first time American bank inspectors were also allowed to review records in Switzerland.
The banks also put "hundreds of people into the search" for long-dormant accounts, Ms. McCaul said.
"We now have trust in the bank management," she added. "We didn't have that before."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: A EUROPEAN INFATUATION;
Investors Aglow Over Entrepreneurs

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, June 4

 BODY:
As recently as two years ago, a small German company like Kinowelt Medien A.G. had almost no hope of selling stock to outside investors.
European stock exchanges were not interested in an obscure family company in Munich that distributes American movies to German theaters. Individual investors were so cautious they rarely bought stocks at all. And American-style venture capitalists were few and far between. 
 Not anymore. On May 12, Kinowelt was the most ardently sought company on the German stock exchange. Within minutes after its shares were traded for the first time, the price tripled to 160 marks, or about $90, from 55 marks. Since then, shares have soared to 374 marks, or $211, nearly seven times the opening price. They closed today at 307 marks, or $173.
The frenzy over Kinowelt is just one example of a fever that is sweeping Europe. In a historic switch that has both amazed and alarmed financial analysts, investors from Frankfurt to Brussels to Amsterdam have fallen in love with entrepreneurs, new companies and anything that remotely resembles a high-technology stock.
Compared with the attraction in the United States, where Internet start-up companies have been going public at huge valuations, the infatuation here is in its early stages. But compared with Europe's past, it is a revolution.
Behind this frenzy is a broad shift among Europeans toward investing in stocks. Because interest rates have declined sharply across the continent, investors who traditionally put all their money in conservative bonds and savings accounts are chasing stocks in search of better returns. In the last few months, Europe's mainstream stock markets have climbed much faster than those in the United States, and the newest European markets, featuring many of the start-ups, have grown the fastest of all.
Until recently, many of Europe's most promising biotechnology and electronics start-ups found it so difficult to raise money at home that they listed their shares in the United States. Some even moved their corporate headquarters across the Atlantic.
But in the last two years, once-stodgy exchanges have started a series of "new markets" tailored to small companies with names like Transtec, Qiagen and Aixtron.
"I couldn't believe it, but taxi drivers in Frankfurt recognized my name from television," said Klaus Kleber, a managing director of LHS Group Inc., a German company that produces computer software for communications systems. Just three years ago, LHS moved to Atlanta and later went public in the United States. But it sold a second batch of shares in Frankfurt last year, and company officials say that most of LHS's stock is now trading in Europe.
But many financial experts warn that the wild run-up in prices has already become a classic speculative bubble, fueled by euphoric and often naive investors who simply assume they can make an overnight profit by selling any new stock for more than they paid as soon as they buy it.
"It is illogical," warned Richard Loeffler, a managing director of Deutsche Beteiligungs A.G., a venture capital arm of Deutsche Bank that invested in some of the companies that have gone public. "People have heard for so long that we don't have enough entrepreneurs, that we lag behind in high technology, so when they see companies that seem to be in biotechnology or computer software they just buy these stocks."
The most spectacular new stock is Mobilcom, a small German company that provides cellular telephone service mainly by leasing and reselling capacity from Germany's three main carriers. Mobilcom went public last fall at 62.50 marks, or $35, but has since soared to 1,400 marks, or $791.50 -- a 22-fold increase. Though Mobilcom's sales are only $182 million, its market capitalization is about $2.7 billion.
The euphoria is everywhere. In Brussels last month, zealous investors overwhelmed the rickety Belgian stock exchange during an initial stock offering by Kinopolis Group, a developer of multiplex movie theaters. Investors had oversubscribed the stock offering by 75 times, setting the stage for a huge jump in price as soon as shares began trading. But because the Belgian stock exchange puts limits on daily price swings, Kinopolis stock was not allowed to start trading until several days after the public offering.
Even unglamorous and low-technology companies have been swept up in the surge.
Consider W.E.T. Automotive Systems A.G., a 30-year-old German family company that makes seat-heaters for cars. When W.E.T. conducted a $27 million initial offering last month, investors ordered 63 times the number of available shares. Shares jumped to 96 marks from 54 marks as soon as trading began. It is now selling for 107.50 marks, or $61.
"A 100 percent profit the first day is not bad," said Bodo Ruthenberg, the company's founder. Mr. Ruthenberg owns 65.6 percent of the stock, which has a net worth of $108 million.
For all the giddiness, bankers and financial analysts say the boom at least partly reflects important changes in Europe that were long overdue.
The new stock exchanges that cater to smaller and younger companies, they say, are providing a crucial source of capital that has long been present in the United States but absent in Europe.
Because small and comparatively untested companies were all but prohibited from selling their shares to the public, American-style venture capitalists were reluctant to invest because they had little way to cash out after several years. The main sources of financing were either bank loans or a company's profits -- of little help to companies with novel ideas or technologies but few assets.
"As a venture capitalist, you could invest but there was no way to harvest your profit after three or five years," said Jos Peters, head of Capricorn Partners, a Belgian venture capital firm, who helped start a European electronic-trading system for small companies called Easdaq. "You were stuck with paper value. What Easdaq has done is to close the circle so that people can attract money at a valuation that reflects the future."
Easdaq, started just two years ago, is a miniature clone of Nasdaq, the American electronic brokerage exchange. It also embodies a traditional American approach to shareholder protection: instead of demanding that companies reach a certain size and show a long record of sales and profits, Easdaq requires companies to adopt international accounting standards and to follow strict rules about disclosing information.
"The normal stock exchanges took the view that they had to protect the investor and that they were only for blue-chip companies," said Jacques Putzeys, the chief executive of Easdaq. "We take the view that we protect the investor against not having enough information."
Partly in response to Easdaq, mainstream stock exchanges have started "new markets" in Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels. The most explosive of these has been Frankfurt's, where new companies are going public every few days and where investors are literally begging brokers for shares regardless of the company's business.
For promising biotechnology and electronics companies, the new exchanges have been a godsend.
Qiagen, a German biotechnology company founded in 1984, had already generated a modest profit and annual sales of about $30 million when it wanted to go public several years ago. But because German financial institutions had little familiarity with biotechnology, the founders turned to the United States and went public on Nasdaq.
"At the time, you couldn't sell most of the young biotech companies here," said Peer Schatz, Qiagen's chief financial officer. "There were virtually no comparable biotech companies listed in Frankfurt. There were no analysts who specialized in the field. And there were no banks to support us. The U.S. markets were much more open."
Last fall, Qiagen returned with a second stock offering in Germany that raised $47 million. "The change is really dramatic," said Metin Colpan, Qiagen's chief executive. "Everyone is now talking about stocks."
But many analysts say the speculative euphoria could be reaching the levels that typically mark an overheated market that is poised for a downturn.
"German retail investors generally have no idea what kind of company they have bought," said Pierre Drach, president of Independent Research, an investment research company in Frankfurt. "Institutions are the main holders of the initial public offering, but then come the retail clients who buy for three times or four times as much."
That may well have been the case with Transtec A.G., a company that markets computer systems and components. Founded 17 years ago by Bernhard Bruscha, a former physicist, Transtec made a stunning debut on the Frankfurt market on April 3 -- only to decline steadily almost every day since then.
Excitement about Transtec had been building for days before the offering, as bankers put out word that investors had placed orders for 120 times the number of shares being offered. Even before the shares officially began to trade, speculators in Germany's informal "gray market" were offering to pay three times the opening price of 71 marks, or $40, to people who had been promised shares in the offering.
When Mr. Bruscha arrived at the stock exchange to watch trading begin, a television news crew and several radio reporters were waiting to interview him.
"We could have sold our entire offering to just two institutional investors," Mr. Bruscha said. "It was really amazing. During our road show, we would sit down for one-on-one meetings and they would just say, 'O.K., we'll take 500,000 shares.' "
Not surprisingly, Transtec shares immediately jumped to 195 marks, or $110, in the first minute of trading. Even Mr. Bruscha acknowledged that the price seemed high.
"From a fundamental, analytical point of view, our bankers had estimated that the value was in the mid-50's or maybe 60 marks," he said. Given the apparent demand, the company and the bankers had pushed up the offering price to 71 marks -- about 27 times projected earnings. But at triple that price, "I would have to say that's a bit rich."
But since then, the shares have headed relentlessly downward. The price dropped to 179 marks on the second day of trading and to 162 marks on the third. At the close of trading today, Transtec shares could be bought for 118.60 marks, or $67.

HEADLINE: Five Nations Join in Plea To Pakistan And India

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: GENEVA, June 4

 BODY:
The United States, Russia, China, Britain and France called on India and Pakistan today to freeze their nuclear weapons development and agree not to test nuclear missiles or arm them with warheads.
In return, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, all nuclear powers themselves, offered to help India and Pakistan reduce tensions over the disputed territory of Kashmir. 
 "We don't want to isolate these countries or make them outcasts or pariahs," Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said after meeting with the four other foreign ministers to discuss ways of bringing the region back from the brink of nuclear war. "We want to engage them in constructive dialogue," she said, "to show them that they have earned nothing, zero, zilch by what they have done."
The five countries disagree about economic sanctions, and are unwilling to offer anything that appears to be a payoff to India or Pakistan, so they are left trying to get individual countries to exert pressure.
"The reason we are not big into inducements here is that we do not want any other country to feel there is a benefit" to testing, Ms. Albright said.
What effect today's appeal would have was unclear.
"We have no illusions that we will succeed overnight," Ms. Albright said. Since the end of the cold war, the United States and Russia do not have as much leverage as they once had in the region, and the three other countries do not have much either.
They will evaluate how well today's strategy works, and foreign ministers of the seven leading industrial democracies plus Russia -- a group that includes all the nations here today except China -- will meet again in London on June 12 to discuss further steps, officials said.
That will add to pressure already brought by Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy to get India and Pakistan to sign the 1996 nuclear test-ban treaty and an earlier agreement to keep nuclear weapons from spreading. Germany and Japan both suspended aid to India after it tested nuclear weapons last month.
Today's meeting was headed by China, which India views as almost as big an adversary as Pakistan, and the Foreign Minister, Tang Jiaxuan, made little effort to disguise the Chinese view that India bore the main responsibility for starting a new arms race in the region.
The five foreign ministers called on India and Pakistan to avoid threatening moves by their conventional military forces, and said they would encourage both to negotiate a solution on Kashmir. American officials said the United States would offer both countries assistance in "confidence-building" technologies that would allow them to monitor each other's activities in the region.
The United States, which has imposed economic sanctions on both countries as required under American law, made no attempt here to get other countries to follow suit. France and Russia were both opposed, and French officials said their main aim here was a plan to encourage both countries to sign and ratify the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
"Isolating India and weakening Pakistan economically is not the way," one French diplomat said.
France conducted underground nuclear tests in the South Pacific in 1995. After a worldwide uproar, President Jacques Chirac ended the testing and France signed the test ban treaty in 1996. China also ended its own underground tests and signed at about the same time.
Some people think France could be in a position to become the Western country with the greatest leverage over India and Pakistan. In the French view, India's motivation in developing operational nuclear weapons was as much fear and resentment of China as it was India's longstanding enmity with Pakistan.

HEADLINE: Trenton Says Tax Revenue Will Increase Its Surplus

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 4

 BODY:
Whitman administration officials said today that they had increased their estimate for tax revenue for the year and now project the state will have a $711 million surplus at the end of the fiscal year on June 30.
In testimony this afternoon to the Assembly Appropriations Committee, the State Treasurer, James A. DiEleuterio Jr., said a surge in income tax revenue was the main factor in increasing the estimated surplus. That revenue is being pushed up by record employment levels, higher incomes and increased capital gains taxes paid on Wall Street investments. 
 "Every key indicator demonstrates the strength of New Jersey's economy," Mr. DiEleuterio said. "Most importantly, more New Jerseyans are employed now than at any time in the state's history. Personal income has increased, retail sales have increased, business investment has increased."
He also reported a forecast for $17.7 billion of tax revenue in the 1998-99 fiscal year, which starts in July, including a recent increase of $93 million.
But even as he reported the new numbers, Mr. DiEleuterio cautioned lawmakers against approving new spending programs. "I am concerned," he said, "that some of the spending programs now in place, which have built-in growth factors, will become difficult to sustain if revenues are sluggish." He noted that several programs, including education, prisons, group homes and the prescription drug program for the low-income elderly and disabled, were costing more this year than originally expected.
After Mr. DiEleuterio's briefing, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman met with the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, and the Assembly Speaker, Jack Collins, to discuss her proposal to raise the gasoline tax by 7 cents a gallon to finance transportation projects and preserve open space.
Mr. DiFrancesco said afterward that the three Republicans had reviewed the needs of the Transportation Trust Fund program, which now spends at least $700 million annually on roads and rail transportation, and Mrs. Whitman's plans to preserve one million acres by 2008.
Mr. Collins said no agreements were reached.
Several top Republicans in the Legislature have said they do not like the notion of using a gasoline tax to pay for preserving open space or any purpose other than roads. But Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. Collins said today that Mrs. Whitman's idea of using 2 cents of the gasoline tax increase for open space was still alive.

HEADLINE: Productivity Growth Shows Slight Fall in First 3 Months

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
Growth in the productivity of American workers lapsed to an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the first three months of the year, in part because employers hired more people to handle an expanding workload, the Labor Department reported today.
The growth rate in the productivity of nonfarm, nonsupervisory workers was considerably better than the two-tenths of a percent estimate issued last month. 
 Still, it represented a slip from the 1.4 percent rate of the last three months of 1997. And it is down considerably from the 1.8 percent average through 1996 and 1997.
In other economic news, factory orders rose 1.2 percent in April, the biggest increase in five months, the Commerce Department said today. But the gain was concentrated in military goods and civilian aircraft.
The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly surged 30,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 339,000, the highest level since early January.
Productivity measures output for every hour of work and is considered crucial to the improvement of living standards. The technology-led increase in productivity in 1996 and 1997, from the 1 percent average from 1974 through 1995, is cited as the key underlying factor in the economy's high-growth, low-inflation performance.
Strong growth in productivity means companies can keep their payrolls lean and pay their workers more while increasing sales and holding the line on prices.
The last time Americans enjoyed low inflation and high growth -- in the 1960's and early 1970's -- productivity growth averaged 2.9 percent a year.
The lapse in first-quarter productivity growth was focused in manufacturing, which accounts for about 18 percent of the nation's business output. It grew at a rate of just seven-tenths of a percent, the worst in four and a half years, after averaging 4.6 percent in 1996 and 1997.
The April gain in factory orders came after a two-tenths of a percent rise in March. Excluding the volatile transportation sector, orders were up a modest three-tenths of a percent in April, little changed from a four-tenths of a percent advance in March.

HEADLINE: THE N.B.A. FINALS;
Stern Talks Lockout, Questions Patriotism

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, June 4

 BODY:
David Stern stopped short of calling them unpatriotic, but he did question the wisdom of players who are considering boycotting this summer's world championships in Athens.
"If the individual players decide to trash their country, that's going to be their decision," Stern said today during his annual address. 
 Flanked by the league's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, Stern spent much of the news conference at the Delta Center detailing the growing labor strife between the players and the owners. The league is expected to lock out the players July 1 if the two sides cannot agree on a revised collective bargaining agreement.
Patrick Ewing, the union's president, has been advising members of the United States team not play. And Michael Jordan supported that stance today.
"In a heartbeat," Jordan said. "I would be in favor of not playing in the world championship games. If you're going to try to handcuff one side, we have to retaliate."
Granik warned that such a boycott could influence the United States' chances for automatically qualifying for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. Granik, who is also the president of USA Basketball, said if the United States did not win the gold medal in Athens it would have to qualify by playing in a qualifying tournament possibly during the 1999-2000 N.B.A. season.
"Wearing the USA Basketball hat, I have concern," Granik said. "We have not gotten any notice or anything from players that they're not going to play, but people obviously have read the reports that it's being discussed. It will certainly damage USA Basketball in its international relations and its standing in the international community."
Billy Hunter, the players association executive director, said the union was investigating whether the United States could receive a bye because it won the gold medal at the Atlanta Games in 1996 and has never failed to qualify for an Olympics He said he was mindful of the players possibly being betrayed as unpatriotic if they boycotted the games.
Among the league's stars, the team includes Grant Hill and Gary Payton. The possibility of sending college players has been discussed, but no formal decision has been made. "We're always worried about our public image," Hunter said. "I am definitely worried about that. Depending upon what the circumstances are, though, David Stern is in the catbird's seat. We hope we can reach an agreement with the N.B.A. to head off the action."
Because players signed contracts with USA Basketball, Stern is mostly wringing his hands when it comes to the league's involvement. But Hunter added, "We could argue we think USA Basketball is the alter ego of the N.B.A."
The boycott talk is merely the latest salvo fired in the labor battle between the two sides. The players canceled a meeting with the owners in New York on Monday, claiming their proposals were unrealistic.
The key issue over which both sides will haggle this summer involves the league's desire to implement a hard salary cap that would put a ceiling on how much teams can spend each season. Such a proposal would most likely do away with the Larry Bird exception, a rule by which teams can pay their own free agents any amount of money to retain their rights.
"They want a hard cap," Dikembe Mutombo, an executive committee member, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution over the weekend. "They want to get rid of the Bird exception. They want to tax teams who spend more. We can't live with that."
The owners exercised their right to reopen the existing deal in April after a revenue split amounted to the players' receiving more than 57 percent of basketball-related income. Once the threshold topped 51.8 percent, the owners were allowed to exercise their option.
While the union does not want a ceiling on player salaries, the league is afraid the enormous contracts of a few have severely hampered its economic system.
"It's really very simple," Granik said. "Under our current system too much money is being paid out in salaries. And we need a new system that will bring salary growth in line with revenue growth."
Asked where the two sides are in negotiations with only 27 days left to make a deal before business is interrupted, Hunter said: "I think it'll come to a head when it's apparent there is going to be a lockout. It's incumbent on the N.B.A. to come up with a process or a system that we feel is beneficial to us. We're farther apart now than when we started."

HEADLINE: Let Vendors Pay for Sidewalk Space

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A free-market alternative to the Giuliani administration's ban on street vendors from a 144-block area of Manhattan (editorial, June 4) is to ration congestion by renting sidewalk space to vendors. Take the south side of 42d Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues: If the Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel determines that no more than five vendors should be on that block, it could give those spots to the five highest bidders. This would decrease congestion and bring the city millions in revenue. 
 Why should vendors use prime locations at no cost when store owners have to pay high rents? Like the store owners, if the vendors cannot afford the rent, they should move somewhere else.

Another Pushcart War

 BODY:

To the Editor:
New York City's contention with food vendors (editorial, June 4) dates back to New Amsterdam. Laws banned peddlers -- traditionally immigrants -- from city streets as early as the 1680's. 
 "Dear Mayor McClellan," wrote Harry Plotkin, president of the East Side Vendors Association in 1906, "please do not forget that we are poor people, that peddling is our only means of earning our bread, and that unless you will grant us this right to peddle, we will fall burdens to the city and to the charitable institutions."
It is sad that in the age of workfare, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani wants to put some of the hardest working New Yorkers out of work.
Fifty years ago, Fiorello H. La Guardia orchestrated a similar campaign that led to a 1938 law virtually outlawing pushcart markets. It put many people out of work during the Depression.

HEADLINE: Foreign Banks to Allow Indonesia More Time to Repay $80 Billion in Debts

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, June 4

 BODY:
Indonesia and a group of foreign bankers agreed today on a framework for rescheduling the repayment of nearly $80 billion in corporate and bank debt, which constituted one of the biggest barriers to restarting the economy.
While the agreement is simply a framework for renegotiating the debt on a case-by-case basis, the unexpectedly quick action by 13 foreign banks meeting with Indonesian officials in Frankfurt gives Indonesia the best economic news it has received in months. 
 It is also a boost to the new Government of President B. J. Habibie, who is struggling to assert his legitimacy in the face of calls for an early election.
The agreement provides for a three-year suspension of principal payments on perhaps $60 billion of debt. It also sets up a government debt agency to buffer fluctuations in currency-exchange rates.
In individual cases, borrowers and banks have until December to work out payment plans and submit them to the debt-restructuring board.
It is hard to predict just how much relief the new repayment structure will provide to borrowers, but it will be considerable and prompt. At the start of this year the Government estimated that $35 billion of debt was falling due this year.
The agreement offers hope that the nation's weakened currency could begin to recover, that cash will start to flow again, that moribund companies will not be crushed by debts and that crucial export industries could grow again, turning around the country's deep recession.
In the political turmoil here, economic activity has come to a virtual halt as the banking system reels from bad loans, interest rates have soared, lending has all but stopped, and cash has become scarce.
The intertwined political and economic crises present Indonesia with a perilous outlook in the months ahead. On a visit here today, Stanley Roth, the top official for Asian affairs at the State Department, said the most important factor in economic recovery now would be the restoration of political stability.
Bankers cautioned that the framework was a prelude to individual negotiations and may be only a guide for stretching out loan repayments. "It's not a magic pill," said an official at one bank involved in the pact.
The pact was spearheaded by a committee involving the Chase Manhattan Bank, the largest American lender to Indonesian companies; Deutsche Bank and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
For hundreds of Indonesian companies, the framework provides a three-year period in which they would only pay interest on their loans. After that, there is a five-year period in which borrowers can make loan payments presumably at renegotiated interest rates and other terms. It gives banks up to four years to pay some $9 billion in debts owed to other banks that now are generally being deferred by informal understandings. As part of the agreement, Indonesia agreed to pay more than $1 billion in bank debt and trade financing that had been in arrears. And to jump-start trade, the pact provides for financing by foreign banks.
Indonesia also agreed to set up a Government office, the Indonesian Debt Restructuring Agency, that will provide sufficient availability of dollars, marks and yen for repayment of foreign loans and protection against currency-rate fluctuations.
One of Indonesia's biggest problems is that its currency has fallen to about 25 percent of its value against the dollar compared with a year ago. As a result, borrowers have watched their foreign loan payments skyrocket, and many have found it impossible to make repayments.
Indonesia had formally halted debt repayments at the beginning of this year, pending an agreement with international banks.
But economists cautioned that the country's economic and political problems are so severe that there is little chance of a quick turnaround. Inflation this year is expected to climb to 50 percent or more, and unemployment to as high as 20 percent. Overall economic growth is projected to contract by at least 10 percent and perhaps as much as 20 percent. By contrast, the country's economic growth averaged 8 percent a year for the last decade.
Financial analysts said today's agreement was far more complex than previous debt-rescheduling accords reached with Mexico in 1995 and South Korea this year because of the large number of Indonesian banks and corporations and weak financial-reporting requirements.
Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, which recently negotiated a $40 billion Indonesian bailout, praised the bank pact for giving "breathing space to recover." He said it would "have the immediate effect of relieving the pressure on the foreign exchange market, and will help to revive international trade and economic activity."
The Jakarta stock exchange rose by 3.5 percent today on news of the agreement. But reflecting a broad discouragement with the country's economic prospects, the Indonesian rupiah showed little response, remaining at 11,550 to the dollar.
Robert Strong, chief credit officer of the Chase Manhattan Bank, which took a lead role in the talks, cautioned that a recovery was still a long way off. "It's going to be a long process," he said., adding that the banking framework is "a very large step, but just one step on a path that will require a lot of work on everybody's part." He also said the pact gave the banks considerable flexibility in deciding which loans to renegotiate, and which trade financings to extend to which companies.
Under today's agreement, the three-year grace period for corporate borrowers on principal payments would begin in December. .
The Indonesian central bank will administer the new debt-restructuring agency, which will operate like a state trust fund. In providing risk protection and the availability of foreign exchange, it will not subsidize exchange rates. Its role is to provide a limited cushion against fluctuations of the rates.
Government officials estimated that companies owing $60 billion would take part. Another $20 billion is owed by companies that are either too damaged for rescue or strong enough to proceed on their own.
For Indonesian banks, the four years that may be used to repay $9 billion in loans applies to borrowings due through next March. The central bank will guarantee the repayments.
Indonesia will ask international banks to make their "best efforts" to maintain trade financing for one year at the levels that existed at the end of April. The Government estimates that such a deal could release financing for $4 billion to $6 billion in trade for Indonesian companies.
Individual debtors and creditor banks must proceed on their own to reach "an amicable agreement" on repayments, said an American banker in Jakarta. "If the Indonesian company still expresses its inability to repay debt, the bank can start bankruptcy proceedings," he said.

HEADLINE: Commencement;
Queens Graduates Urged to Press for Change

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Speaking critically of cutbacks in social programs, Allen Lee Sessoms, the president of Queens College, urged about 3,800 graduates of the institution at its 74th commencement yesterday to "use your advantage to change things for the better."
The challenges of today, he declared, are "different and in some ways more insidious" than those of the 1960's when he was a student. He cited as examples legislation to restrict immigration, reduced financial support for public higher education, efforts by some groups to impose their religious beliefs on others, welfare reforms that do not provide positive alternatives and the denial of access to higher education for young, single parents. 
 Speaking at the quadrangle at the center of the campus on Kissena Boulevard, Mr. Sessoms concluded by warning that if enlightened graduates did not participate in the transformation of society, "I can assure you that others, who may not be as forward looking as you, will."
The student commencement speaker was Nikola Duravcevic who fled the draft by the Serbs in the former Yugoslavia in 1991, and made headlines when he led the Borough of Manhattan Community College chess team to twice wrest a chess championship from Harvard.
An economics major and a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Mr. Duravcevic has accepted a position in investment banking at Credit Suisse First Boston Bank.
Mr. Duravcevic praised the Queens community for its hospitality to him and other immigrants, and said he had learned that the purpose of higher education was "to stretch the mind beyond one's own imagination."

HEADLINE: Steinbrenner Warns Vallone to Drop Bid For a Stadium Vote

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
Opening a new front in the political battle over the future of Yankee Stadium, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the team's principal owner, all but threatened last night to leave New York City unless Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, abandoned his push for a referendum on whether city money should be used to help build a new ball park.
Mr. Steinbrenner's comments came only hours after City Council leaders, in a rare act of defiance toward Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, unveiled their own plan for the city's next budget. For the last several days, the Mayor and the City Council have been deadlocked over the budget because of Mr. Giuliani's refusal to consider any changes proposed by the Council unless Mr. Vallone gave up his call for a public vote on the stadium issue. 
 In his statement, Mr. Steinbrenner accused Mr. Vallone of using the referendum to bolster his campaign for governor, and added: "Politics has driven more teams from New York City than any of us care to remember, most recently the football Giants and Jets to New Jersey. I do not want to move the Yankees from New York, but I must warn: he is bringing us dangerously close."
The Yankees owner's words were the strongest he has used so far on the subject of the team's future home, and they came a month after he stated that he would make no decision on whether the team would leave its storied home in the Bronx until the end of the season because, he said, the issue had become too emotional and politicized.
Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for the Mayor, said she had been unaware of Mr. Steinbrenner's five-paragraph statement, which echoed many of the criticisms of Mr. Vallone that Mr. Giuliani and his aides had voiced hours earlier. But aides to the Council Speaker accused the Mayor of pressing Mr. Steinbrenner to issue the statement.
Mr. Steinbrenner's spokesman, Howard J. Rubenstein, said Mr. Steinbrenner had no contact with the Mayor's office before issuing his statement.
Last night, Mr. Vallone responded to Mr. Steinbrenner's comments, saying: "Yankee Stadium is a good debate and everyone should have a say in it. But it's appalling that Mr. Steinbrenner would insert himself into the city budget process on behalf of Rudy Giuliani."
Mr. Vallone has contended that the voters should have a say in whether to use hundreds of millions of dollars in public money for sports stadiums. Mr. Giuliani has said such a vote would galvanize opposition to the idea of building a new stadium on the West Side of Manhattan and push the Yankees owner to look for a new stadium site in New Jersey.
For his part, Mr. Steinbrenner said in his statement that Mr. Vallone was using the Yankees as "a political baseball in what certainly seems like a move he thinks will aid him in his race for governor."
"Mr. Vallone," he said, "is attempting to block the city from even considering Manhattan's West Side as a potential site for a new Yankee Stadium even though an in-depth study commissioned by the city, the state and the Yankees suggested it was the most viable option."
The war of words came at the close of a day in which Mr. Vallone and the Mayor wrangled aggressively over the budget and its tangled connection with the stadium issue.
With the negotiations stalled over the budget, the Council offered its own proposal that is expected to be approved today. That plan, at $34.08 billion, was actually $49 million less than the budget the Mayor proposed a few weeks ago, and contained a few hundred million dollars in changes that, in a year of a $2 billion record surplus, could be expected to be ironed out easily through the usual give-and-take of budget talks.
Nevertheless, the two sides spent the day warring and accusing each other of fiscal recklessness and political duplicity.
"I'm a politician," Mr. Giuliani said. "I understand what's going on. This budget is not about governing the city for the next year. It's about Peter Vallone running for governor. That's what the budget is about: Peter Vallone trying to make a statement in his campaign for governor."
Presenting details of his plan to reporters, Mr. Vallone shot back, "This will be a historic event." Of the stadium question, he said: "This will be the first time a Mayor took an issue and made it an overriding issue more important than the budget. The politics of it are from that side of the hall, not this side."
The Council has never adopted its own budget since acquiring the power to do so under the City Charter revision of 1989. And if, as expected, the overwhelmingly Democratic Council approves the Vallone budget, the action is likely to trigger a series of legal battles with the Mayor, possibly beginning with a veto within the next five days.
A vote for a separate budget would abruptly end a long period of fiscal harmony between the city's two most powerful politicians, whose annual budget negotiations have been complicated this year by Mr. Vallone's gubernatorial ambitions and Mr. Giuliani's desire to secure a new home for the Yankees.
Both men were able to work out painful cuts during the recession a few years ago; this year, New York's current financial boom has given them ample room to propose costly, and competing, projects.
At first, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Vallone predicted a compromise that would accommodate their personal goals. But budget talks collapsed on Monday.
The Mayor, who wants to use $600 million over the next few years to help pay for new ball parks, including a possible Yankee stadium on Manhattan's West Side, demanded that the Speaker drop his push for a referendum that would ask voters whether taxpayers' money should be used for ball parks. Mr. Vallone, one of several Democrats hoping to oppose Gov. George E. Pataki in November, refused even to discuss the topic.
At the same time, the Council Speaker pushed for steep cuts in the city's personal income tax, a proposal intended to give him a strong selling point on the stump and to pre-empt any criticism that he has supported tax increases in the past. Mr. Giuliani opposed these tax cuts, asserting that the city could not afford them.
The cuts, which would cost the city about $201 million in revenue in the next budget and more than $500 million a year after that, could also jeopardize Mr. Giuliani's plan to use at least $600 million from a commercial rent tax to help pay for new stadiums, especially if Wall Street's torrent into the city coffers turns into a trickle.
Council leaders included the tax cuts in the spending plan that they released yesterday. That plan also seeks to retire $165 million in debt; it restores cuts by the Mayor and finances some new programs, including recycling, library services and after-school programs.
In the spending plan, the Council said it could finance its goals by cutting $112 million from various city agencies, and by recalculating savings the city would get from reduced welfare rolls, lower interest rates paid on its long-term debt, and other areas. City officials described these assumptions as risky.
"When you look at the actual budget document that they have cobbled together, said Randy M. Mastro, Deputy Mayor for Operations, "you should be asking yourselves how much spending increases are really there, how much illusory spending decreases are really there that will have to be painful in future years, how much they've increased the out-year gaps to fund a feel-good election-year budget."
Mr. Mastro declined to say whether Mr. Giuliani would veto items from the plan or veto it entirely. Although the Council could then override his veto, the Mayor has said that he would impound city funds to spend on programs.
As the city government prepared to deal for the first time with a nonconsensus budget, some officials bemoaned that the breakdown would ultimately hurt taxpayers. Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler of Queens said: "Passing our own budget is a prescription for ineffectiveness. The Mayor will hold back spending in many areas, and that will deprive people of what they want. This is not in the interest of the public."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
10 Years After First Sale, Co-op Makes Comeback

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Sales are expected to restart next month at Turtle Bay Towers, putting the 337-unit co-op at 310 East 46th Street back in the market for the first time in a decade.
The plan -- reached by the co-op board and the Rockrose Development Corporation, the sponsor -- is to improve the 26-story structure and sell the 245 unsold apartments, many with terraces and greenhouses. Prices are expected to range from $135,000 to $400,000 for the studio lofts and one- and two-bedroom apartments, with 550 to 1,600 square feet. Those prices, on average, are about 5 to 10 percent higher than what the units sold for in 1988, when they originally went on the market. 
 Market-rate mortgages will also be available to buyers through American Home Mortgage, overcoming a financing difficulty often faced by purchasers in buildings where fewer than 51 percent of the units have been sold. About 95 units are expected to come on the market this year, starting with as many as 18 next month. The wedding-cake style structure, between First and Second Avenues, was converted in 1988 from a rental that Rockrose had reshaped 13 years earlier from a 1929 office and light industrial loft building that had been damaged by a natural gas explosion in 1973. Only 28 percent of the apartments were sold before the recession hit and the market soured, as did the relationship between the co-op board and Rockrose, whose headquarters are in the building's ground-level commercial space.
Several lawsuits between the sponsor and the board further splintered their relationship. Meanwhile, the unsold apartments were rented out.
There are 68 apartments that are leased to rent-stabilized tenants, who are allowed to remain in their units at regulated rents. An additional 177 apartments that are also owned by Rockrose are rented to tenants who replaced residents who had been living in the building when it became a co-op. Tenants in these apartments are not protected by rent regulations, and the market rents that they pay had given Rockrose little incentive to sell their units because the rents exceeded the monthly maintenance charges.
Last fall, Rockrose and the co-op board, encouraged by Manhattan's strong sales market, set their sights on the same goal: selling the unsold units. After seven months of negotiations, they devised a refinancing and building-wide renovation program to make the building more attractive.
The building's $25 million mortgage was refinanced at a lower interest rate in April after Rockrose, which held the mortgage, agreed to waive all but $500,000 of an $11 million prepayment penalty. The new $30 million loan is at a fixed interest rate of 6.63 percent for 20 years instead of the original 10.53 percent, said Andrew J. Singer, chairman of the Singer & Bassuk Organization, which arranged the financing for the co-op. The lender was PruExpress, a subsidiary of the Prudential Insurance Company of America, which is based in Newark.
"This loan indicates that lenders are willing to finance underlying mortgages in less than substantially sold co-ops -- which they had avoided because of the troubles of sponsors in the late 80's -- if the buildings are otherwise financially sound," Mr. Singer said. "As a result, lenders of loans to co-op buyers are following suit."
For Turtle Bay Towers, the new loan will enable the co-op board to make repairs and reduce monthly maintenance fees by 10 percent. The projected monthly fees will range from $800 to $2,200 on most apartments, though they will be as high as $2,700 on a few units.
"This deal took a dead-end situation in terms of refinancing the underlying mortgage and turned it into a positive," said Naomi C. Gardner, a lawyer for the co-op. She said the co-op also borrowed about $3 million to make repairs to the building's facade as well as to unit owners' terraces and greenhouses.
Wayne W. Reckhow, president of the co-op board, is optimistic about the changes. "This is the most significant step taken to improve the building's situation," said Mr. Reckhow, who has owned his apartment for 10 years but has rented it out since 1992. "Now I feel better about the prospects of obtaining a satisfactory sales price."
Rockrose, among other things, also will pay its share of the building's improvements and sell the units a few at a time to people who want to live in the building rather than in a bulk sale to investors.
In exchange, the co-op extended Rockrose's lease on the commercial space, hired the company to manage the building and agreed to the improvement program.
"Along with managing the building, we get $25 million from the payment of the mortgage," said Kevin P. Singleton, vice president and general manager at Rockrose. Rockrose filed an amendment to its offering plan earlier this week with the New York State Attorney General's office. If it is accepted, which is expected within 30 days, sales will begin. Tenants buying apartments, which feature 10- to 12-foot-high ceilings, will be given priority, but not a discount from the asking prices. The units are to sell at an average price of about $250 for each square foot of space.

Gooden Wins First For Indians

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:

Indians 3, Twins 2
Dwight Gooden, the former Yankee and Met, won for the first time with the Cleveland Indians, making Jim Thome's three-run homer stand up in a 3-2 victory at Minnesota.
Gooden (1-2) allowed one run and six hits in six innings, allowing the lone run to score on Marty Cordova's second-inning home run. 
 Gooden, a 33-year-old right-hander, was making his third start of the season after opening the year on the disabled list because of biceps tendinitis in his pitching shoulder.
 
Red Sox 9, Orioles 1
Bret Saberhagen allowed one run in seven innings and Darren Lewis drove in three runs as host Boston rebounded from its only shutout loss of the season with a victory over Baltimore.
Red Sox reliever Dennis Eckersley, 43, was placed on the 15-day disabled list yesterday because of a sore right shoulder. Reliever John Wasdin was recalled. Wasdin is 3-2 with a 6.28 e.r.a. in his second season with Boston.
 
Athletics 6, Rangers 1
Rickey Henderson homered for the third time in three games and Jimmy Haynes and Bill Taylor combined on a five-hitter, leading host Oakland.
 
Blue Jays 9, Tigers 6
Shawn Green and Carlos Delgado each hit two-run homers and Ed Sprague had a three-run double as host Toronto beat Detroit.
Sprague's bases-clearing hit in the fifth gave Toronto a 7-2 lead. Then Toronto had to hold off a comeback sparked by Tony Clark's two-run homer and Joe Randa's two-run double that cut it to 7-6 in the seventh.
 
White Sox 7, Royals 1
Jamie Navarro pitched a complete-game eight-hitter and Jeff Abbott hit a three-run home run to lead Chicago at Kansas City.
Navarro (5-6) snapped a personal three-game losing streak. He benefited from inning-ending double plays in the first, second, sixth and seventh.
 
CLEVELAND
The Indians quickly raised $60 million yesterday by selling out all 4 million shares of common stock at $15 each in about one hour. After the offering sold out, the stock was trading in the $14.75 to $15.25 range.
 
SEATTLE
The new $417 million ball park for the Mariners will be called Safeco Field, club officials said yesterday. Under an agreement signed Wednesday, Safeco, the nation's 15th largest insurance and investment company, will pay the Mariners about $40 million -- $1.8 million a year for 20 years with annual inflation adjustments -- plus hundreds of thousands of dollars annually in community projects and other promotional work on behalf of the American League club.

HEADLINE: Motorola Says It Will Cut 15,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 4

 BODY:
Motorola Inc. announced late today that it would eliminate 15,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force, and take a $1.95 billion charge against second-quarter earnings, the direst indicator yet of tough times in the semiconductor industry.
Motorola also warned that it would report an operating loss for the second quarter, its first plunge into the red since the semiconductor industry slump of 1985. 
 The forecast quickly took its toll on the shares of Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill. After rising 68.75 cents during the day, to $51.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, the share price fell as low as $49 in after-hours trading.
Analysts had already slashed their consensus earnings projections to 20 cents a share from 43 cents after Motorola announced in April that the quarter had begun poorly. But Motorola said then that it expected to finish close to the 23-cents-a- share profit it earned in the first quarter, so today's projection of a loss was a shock.
"Some people have downplayed Motorola's repeated earnings disappointments because of the problems in their communications businesses, but this clearly shows the semiconductor industry is suffering from overcapacity exacerbated by the economic crisis in Asia," said Charles Hill, director of research at the First Call Corporation, a Boston-based firm that tracks corporate earnings estimates of Wall Street analysts.
Indeed, Motorola's bad news merely put an exclamation point on what others in its industry had been reporting. National Semiconductor warned investors early in the spring that Wall Street's projections for its recently completed second quarter were too high. (Those figures have not yet been reported.)
Last month, Analog Devices, a chip maker; Applied Materials, a leading supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and AMP Inc., the world's leading supplier of connectors and other passive components used on chips, issued similar warnings.
Robert L. Growney, Motorola's president and chief operating officer, said today in a written statement: "It is clearly time to accelerate the implementation of our renewal plan. We are determined to return our financial results to acceptable levels as soon as possible."
Mr. Growney's statement meant things have gotten so bad that it was time for Motorola's largest layoffs and write-offs ever.
The company has suffered a double whammy. Demand in Asia has slowed for many of its cellular phones, pagers and other products, most of which contain Motorola semiconductors. At the same time, there is heightened competition from Asian manufacturers that are desperate for sales and can cut prices without sacrificing profits because their currencies have been devalued.
It has been difficult to offset those problems in the developed world, in part because Motorola has fumbled the move from analog to digital wireless phone technology and the once-rapid growth of its domestic paging business has slowed.
Once the overwhelming leader in cellular phones and systems to serve them, it has lost ground to companies like Lucent Technologies, Nokia, L. M. Ericsson, and Qualcomm.
"The positive side of this is that Chris Galvin has been given an opportunity to take drastic corrective steps and it looks like he's taking it," said Mark McKechnie, an analyst at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, referring to Christopher B. Galvin, the company's chief executive officer.
Motorola said that the job reductions, associated plant closings in semiconductors and paging operations, and plans to sell poorly performing businesses should eventually save $750 million annually.
The job reductions will take place over the next 12 months. Motorola declined to comment on where the layoffs would be concentrated. The domestic semiconductor operations are based primarily in Arizona.
Mr. Galvin was unavailable for interviews before the company's conference call with analysts, scheduled for Friday morning. In his written comments, he emphasized that the company would continue to invest in growth opportunities and singled out plans to introduce new digital phones in the third quarter. He said that the communications sector of the company had begun to improve and that overall performance should be better "given stabilized economic conditions in Asia."
Motorola earned $180 million on sales of $6.9 billion in the first quarter of this year. Earnings have been slumping since 1995, when they topped $2 billion for the year.
Semiconductor business cycles are nothing new for Motorola. It suffered deep earnings plunges in both the 1970's and 1980's. Motorola has already taken numerous steps in its attempts to cushion the impact of the current downturn and reinvigorate sectors like the cellular phone business, where its own errors have compounded its problems.
The company is in the process of closing a pager factory in Puerto Rico. It also said recently that it was ending a $12.9 billion project to create a network of 66 low-orbit satellites for carrying Internet traffic in favor of investing $750 million for a 26 percent stake in Teledesic, a consortium planning to launch 288 satellites aimed at the same market.
So far, none of those steps have done much to encourage investors who have suffered through the stock's long slide from a peak of $90 last summer. Some analysts predicted shares could fall to the mid-40's after today's news.
 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 6, 1998, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about job reductions planned by Motorola Inc., misstated the number of low-orbit satellites the company had envisioned for a network that it is now abandoning. It was 63 low-orbit satellites, not 66.

HEADLINE: Rainy Season Starts, but Mexico Fires Roar On

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 5

 BODY:
The first showers of the rainy season have fallen across parts of Mexico and Central America but have failed to quench many wildfires that are destroying virgin forests and feeding a smoke cloud that is drifting across the southern United States, officials said today.
Mexican and American officials predicted that some fires, which have consumed millions of acres of forest and grassland across the region, may continue to rage for several weeks. About 150 fires, 23 of them large, very destructive blazes, were burning this week. 
 Agricultural Secretary Dan Glickman, who led an American delegation that flew over vast blazes roaring through one cloud forest in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas in southern Mexico on Thursday, described them today at a breakfast with reporters here as "a catastrophe." Another senior American official said they were the worst he had seen.
"This disaster in Mexico has to be the most serious of its kind in the world, including Indonesia," said Brian Atwood, director of the Agency for International Development. "The duration of these fires, the complexity of fighting them and the danger to the firefighters, it's the most serious that we've seen."
The United States delegation visited Mexico to coordinate a $5 million assistance program, which includes a heavy-lift helicopter and radios, as well as boots and other safety equipment for 3,000 Mexican forest rangers. Many Mexican firefighters have been wearing straw hats and sandals while battling flames with buckets of water.
Despite the new equipment, Mr. Glickman said that because many fires were raging across virtually impenetrable mountain ravines and ridges "rainfall will have as much to do with extinguishing the fires as anything else."
Some of the fires began in January, then flared into an international conflagration in late April with the beginning of the traditional agricultural burning season. So far, seasonal rains that began this week have not been heavy enough.
"Light rains have begun in some areas but they're not sufficient to extinguish these fires," Mr. Atwood said. A spokesman for Mexico's Environment Ministry agreed today with that assessment.
The American officials praised Mexico's battle to control the fires, in which more than 60 firefighters have died this year.
"They're doing an outstanding job fighting this thing," Mr. Glickman said. Those comments and praise by other American officials contrasted with statements by Mexican conservationists, who have argued that the Mexican and American Governments have been slow to react.
In an interview today, for instance, Homero Aridjis, a prominent Mexican environmentalist, called the Mexican Government's response to the wildfires "really exasperating."
"At first the policy was to minimize the fires," Mr. Aridjis said. "And now that much of our ecological patrimony has been destroyed, the Government is still waiting for rains to put them out. This is like waiting for Godot."
The Environment Secretary, Julia Carabias, defended herself and other officials today against a barrage of similar recent criticisms, saying her Government "took precautions, sounded the alert, acted vigorously and continues to act."
President Ernesto Zedillo, standing at Ms. Carabias's side on a visit to a mountain park burned by recent wildfires that roared through a Mexico City suburb, said, "Our country has suffered what I would characterize as a true ecological tragedy."
He said many, perhaps most, of the blazes had started as out-of-control agricultural fires, set by peasant farmers who prepare their fields for planting by burning the previous year's stubble. Also, forests have been set afire to clear plots for growing marijuana or opium, he said.
"There have been fires caused by narcotics traffickers," Mr. Zedillo said.
A report that the American officials handed out describing fires in the region said Nicaragua had suffered the most. More than 13,000 fires there have seared nearly 2 million acres of land, compared with about 900,000 acres in Mexico. Managua's airport has been closed for eight days in the last three weeks because of smoke, the report said.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Minefield Of What to Do

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
"Thinking the unthinkable" is how the nuclear priesthood refers to it. The Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests have reignited fierce debates over doctrine. Do nuclear weapons make the world a more dangerous or a safer place? Can or should the United States try to prevent other nations from acquiring nuclear bombs?
"A profound test is under way of classical theories of deterrence and international relations," said Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, at a packed seminar on the subject in Washington this week. 
 From the moment the United States exploded the atomic bomb in 1945, a small group of American military intellectuals -- the "thermonuclear Jesuits," as Fred Kaplan, in his 1983 book "The Wizards of Armageddon," called them -- quickly understood that nuclear weapons made much of earlier American military thinking obsolete. Beginning at Yale University and later shifting to the Rand Corporation in Southern California, Bernard Brodie, a political scientist and naval strategist, invented nuclear strategy, the military establishment's new catechism.
For the four years that the United States had a nuclear monopoly, it could afford the luxury of visionary ideas. Shortly after the war, it proposed the abolition of nuclear arms, but that was vetoed at the United Nations by the Soviet Union.
In "The Absolute Weapon," published in 1946, Mr. Brodie wrote that the main function of nuclear weapons was deterring wars, not fighting them. Nonetheless, he, Albert J. Wohlstetter, Herman Kahn, Thomas C. Schelling and others soon began systematically contemplating their use. In the 1950's and early 60's, they coined the chilling phrases "counterforce" and "second strike" for the nuclear doctrines they devised.
One of the first public policy expressions of the new strategic thinking surfaced in 1957, says Professor Schelling, a professor of economics and public affairs at the University of Maryland. That year, the Gaither Commission warned President Eisenhower that American nuclear weapons were highly vulnerable to a surprise attack from Moscow. Hence, the panel argued, the Soviets might be tempted to strike first in the hope of wiping out the American bombers that could carry nuclear bombs to their targets. To deter such an attack, the United States needed to make sure it could hit back with a second strike.
So the United States upgraded the Navy's Polaris submarine program and replaced its Atlas and Titan missiles. The new Minuteman missiles, smaller and solid fueled, were theoretically less susceptible to attack because they could be protected in underground silos and fired instantly.
Washington also began a national civil defense program that had children diving under their desks in "duck and cover" drills and what Professor Schelling calls the "fall-out shelter-in-the-backyard craze."
As President Kennedy's Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara raised the contentious issue of how many nuclear weapons were enough to deter an attack. In succession, he gave two different answers that led to the doctrine of deterrence that still dominates much of American strategic thinking.
In a speech in Ann Arbor, Mich., in 1962, Mr. McNamara said that American strategic forces should be aimed at Russian forces, not cities. This counterforce doctrine ushered in the era of what was known as flexible nuclear response and the end of all-out destruction or "massive retaliation." Two years later he refined, or as some said, backed away from that doctrine, however, by urging President Lyndon B. Johnson to insure that if the Russians launched a surprise counterforce strike, the United States would still have enough forces to destroy the Soviet Union's military controls, 30 percent of its population and half its industrial base. What he called "mutual assured destruction," was quickly derided by critics by its acronym, MAD. But for Mr. McNamara, it was the only hope of limiting the military's insatiable appetite for more and more arms and of providing a stable balance of nuclear terror.
 
A New Concern About Other Powers
 In the late 1960's and early 70's, says Spurgeon M. Keeny Jr., the president of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, military analysts grew concerned not just about the arms race between the superpowers (known as vertical proliferation) but also about horizontal proliferation, the spread of nuclear weapons to nonnuclear countries. To counter vertical proliferation, the superpowers signed the so-called SALT II agreement and the ABM Treaty in 1972, which capped the growth of strategic missile launchers and effectively banned missile defense systems. Defense systems were not only exorbitantly expensive but dangerous as well: if a country was sure that its own arsenal was shielded from attack, it might be tempted to take out its opponent's.
To deal with the horizontal problem, the United States signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1968 and imposed export controls on the sale of nuclear technology. Under the treaty, nations pledged to forgo developing nuclear weapons in exchange for help with their civilian nuclear energy programs. They also agreed to international inspection of their nuclear facilities. Only five countries -- the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China, those that had already tested nuclear weapons -- were recognized under the treaty as declared nuclear weapons states.
When the cold war ended, some arms controllers argued that even more progress could be made to curb both vertical and horizontal proliferation. At first those hopes seemed justified, argued William C. Potter, director of the Monterey Institute's Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California. The Russians and Americans signed two more arms control treaties. Meanwhile, by the time some 185 signers met to debate and approve the permanent extension of the Nonproliferation Treaty in 1995, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan had agreed to forgo nuclear weapons development and to remove nuclear warheads from their soil. South Africa had given up its seven nuclear devices. Argentina and Brazil had also relinquished a nuclear option, and international inspection standards of atomic sites were strengthened.
Dr. Potter says such accomplishments prompted a "false sense of security." What many analysts now fear is what Dr. Potter called an "erosion of the basic consensus underlining the Nonproliferation and Test Ban Treaties: that having nuclear weapons does not enhance a country's security."
Jayantha Dhanapala, a Sri Lankan disarmament expert and a senior United Nations official, argues that horizontal and vertical nuclear weapons policies are linked. He cites the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, on which he served, which said in 1996 that stopping proliferation was "inextricably linked to the continued possession of nuclear weapons by a handful of states." As long as the nuclear powers resisted disarmament, as opposed to arms limitation, Mr. Dhanapala said, the perception that nuclear arms enhanced political status and security would remain what he called a source of fatal attraction. He says all nuclear nations should disarm.
Some theoreticians and policy makers agree that horizontal and vertical proliferation are linked but come to the opposite conclusion. Kenneth N. Waltz, an American political scientist who teaches at Columbia, defends nuclear weapons as having deterred a nuclear war for more than 40 years. He argues that their spread would also deter atomic conflicts between other countries -- if it works here, it will work elsewhere.
"The hypocrisy of the America's position is astonishing," he said. "We tell Pakistan and India, neither of which ever signed the NPT and therefore is violating no international commitment, that nuclear weapons are bad for them and that it's bad to test, when we and the Russians have done far more tests over the years than we had any scientific or technical reason to do."
John J. Mearsheimer, a political science professor at the University of Chicago and a Waltz disciple, said that while he was not in favor of the Indian and Pakistani tests, "I would argue that a conflict between them is less likely if they openly have nuclear weapons than without them."
Mr. Schelling says most military theorists and policy makers reject the Waltz-Mearsheimer thesis. "Even if the occurrence of conflict may be less likely," he said, "the consequences of failure would be horrendous." But equally unrealistic, he maintains, are calls for the nuclear powers to relinquish all nuclear weapons, as the Canberra Commission urged and as the writer Jonathan Schell advocates in a new book, "The Gift of Time," (1998). "I live in the real world," said Mr. Schelling, who adds that countries under the United States nuclear umbrella have felt secure even without their own nuclear weapons.
 
Failing to Consider A Lapse of Reason
 Mr. Potter argues that the fatal flaw with respect to deterrence and proliferation theories is that both depend on rationality. "You assume cool and calculating determinations of how your interests are maximized," he said, "which discounts the probability of miscalculation, accident or sheer panic."
Richard Betts, a political science professor at Columbia, echoes the consensus that emerged at the Washington meeting, that neither deterrence doctrine nor the treaties and agreements would be radically affected in the short run by India's and Pakistan's tests.
But Mr. Betts argued that the tests had highlighted the contradiction between the written American pledge to disarm (in the Nonproliferation Treaty) and the longstanding commitment not to disarmament but to arms reductions.
The tests could also reopen long-simmering cold war debates, like whether the United States now needs ballistic missile defenses in a proliferating world. "In some ways, the situation for India and Pakistan is comparable to where we were with the Russians in 1950," he said. Thus their choices could have profound implications for the future of arms control. "If they choose proliferation and the debates lead to international paralysis or inaction," he said, "I would bet we'll see some defections among those who have renounced nuclear weapons in the next few years."

HEADLINE: Toll Reaches 96 as Hunt for German Crash Victims Nears End

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, June 5

 BODY:
With rescue efforts virtually ended after Germany's worst rail crash in more than 50 years, officials said today that the death toll stood at 96.
The train, Inter City Express 884, slammed into a steel-reinforced concrete overpass at 125 miles an hour on Wednesday in the north German town of Eschede. Rescue officials said today that there was an increasing belief among investigators that a broken wheel flung the train from the tracks as it passed over a switch just before it hit the road overpass. 
 On Thursday investigators found damage to the tracks about three and a half miles south of the crash, suggesting that the wheel broke at that point.
Rescue officials in Eschede said today that only 19 of the dead had been formally identified. In many cases, even traditional methods of identification were proving impossible because of extensive head injuries. The police say they want to spare relatives from seeing the mangled bodies until the authorities are sure of their identities.
The authorities withdrew 60 of the 104 high-speed Inter City Express trains from service on Thursday so that they could be inspected for fatigue in their undercarriages. Ten returned to service today. The withdrawal of the trains left Germany's vaunted rail service in chaos.
Some people in Hamburg -- the scheduled destination of Inter City 884 from Munich -- and in Hanover, 35 miles south of the wreck, placed flowers next to the tracks.
Veit Steinle, a spokesman for the Transport Ministry in Bonn, said that investigators had discovered debris along the track before the overpass and that there was evidence that the train had finally swayed out of control some 300 yards before Eschede. But officials said it could take weeks or months before an official inquiry reported on the cause.
Klaus Wurster, a rail expert from Technical University in Berlin, told German television that the failure in the wheel was "completely inexplicable" because the rolling gear of the Inter City Express trains is routinely checked by ultrasound examination every four days. The stricken train had been inspected the day before it crashed, officials said.

HEADLINE: Former Korean Dissident Returns to Land of Exile as Head of State

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, June 1

 BODY:
Fourteen years ago, Kim Dae Jung was a pro-democracy activist living in exile in Washington, struggling with his English and with American officials who saw him as a pest.
"I was an irritant that the State Department and the President wanted to do without," Mr. Kim wrote about the Reagan Administration in his unpublished autobiography. "The White House consistently rebuffed my direct approaches and my request for a meeting with the President." 
 When President Kim of South Korea returns to the United States for a nine-day state visit beginning on Saturday, he will get better treatment. This time he is to stay in Washington at Blair House, the American Government's official guest residence, and address a joint session of Congress.
Mr. Kim, the onetime dissident who became South Korea's President in February, will also get a state dinner at the White House, receive a human rights award and pick up an honorary degree at Georgetown University.
Yet, asked if he was tempted to pick up the telephone at Blair House and place an "I told you so" call to some of the former gate-keepers who used to fend him off, Mr. Kim paused only a moment to savor the idea. He grinned and demurred, but he said he did draw some lessons from his reversal of fortune.
"You have to live long," he said with a sparkle in his eye.
Mr. Kim has indeed lived long -- he is 74 -- and he credits his survival in part to American intervention when Korean dictators planned to kill him. That makes his state visit an especially poignant moment, diplomats and Korean officials say.
Moreover, Mr. Kim in some ways trumpets what are often called American values even more than Americans do.
"The fact that the United States so frequently speaks out on human rights issues in other countries, sometimes to the disadvantage of its own national interests, that is what makes the United States great, that is what makes it earn respect from around the world," Mr. Kim said in an hourlong interview this week in Blue House, the presidential mansion in Seoul.
Still, Mr. Kim acknowledged that in some respects he is now in the position of the officials who fended him off when he was a dissident. Asked if he sometimes faces a choice between his moral principles and the dictates of statecraft, when he ponders whether to speak out on issues like human rights in China, Mr. Kim nodded.
"I am faced with that dilemma," he said. "And certainly I cannot say at this point whether I will or will not make a public statement about that. But I do have a great deal of personal interest in what happens in China and Myanmar, especially Myanmar," he added, referring to the country formerly known as Burma.
These days, Mr. Kim has emerged to some extent as a spokesman for the region and not just his country. The state visit to America will add to his stature and to this regional leadership role, a role that he seems to relish.
"As painful as the current situation is, we wish to use it as much as we can to push through economic reforms, to make our democracy stronger, so that we will be a model for the Asian region, a model that says that you have to promote democracy and the free market in parallel, and that the future of Asia lies in this model," Mr. Kim said.
Yet for Mr. Kim to sustain his role as a model for the region, he will first have to overcome South Korea's economic crisis. And that too is a reason for the state visit: Mr. Kim will begin his visit in the financial capital of New York, not the political capital of Washington, and he will emphasize South Korea's efforts to restructure its economy and woo investors.
"It is of utmost importance that we win foreign investment," Mr. Kim said. "With the capital that comes in with foreign investment, we can pay back our debts. With the foreign capital will come new ways of management, making our management more rational and breathing new life into our economy."
After arriving in New York on Saturday and helping open the Korea Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and speaking to several organizations, Mr. Kim is to go to Washington on Monday for a meeting with President Clinton and his speech to Congress. On Thursday, he will travel to California and deliver a speech at Stanford University and visit Silicon Valley. On June 12 he will go on to Los Angeles, a center for Korean-Americans, and will leave for home the next day.
Mr. Kim was hailed at home as virtually a savior when he took office, even as he lectured his nation on the need to accept the pain of layoffs and restructuring. But in recent weeks, some business analysts have said the steam has gone out of his initiatives.
Mr. Kim disagrees. He said he is concerned about rising unemployment but still confident that South Korea is on the right track to recreate itself as a more open and market-oriented economy.
"What gives me hope is that we are probably over the worst phase of the foreign currency crunch," he said, adding that foreign exchange reserves have risen from $3.8 billion last December to $34 billion today. Interest rates have dropped and a trade deficit has turned into a substantial surplus, he noted.
One concern for foreign investors has been the militancy of South Korean unions, which have been hostile to layoffs and have turned to strikes and sometimes violence to resist restructuring. The unions have agreed to postpone strikes until Mr. Kim's return from the United States, however, and Mr. Kim argues that the worst is over for the labor unrest. He also promises to crack down on unions that break the law.

HEADLINE: House Approves Budget With Deeper Cuts In Spending and Taxes Than in 1997 Deal

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5

 BODY:
The House narrowly approved a plan today to cut taxes and spending far more deeply than last year's bipartisan balanced budget deal. The move put Republicans on another ideological collision course with the White House over the size and role of the Federal Government.
Despite the defection of nine moderates unwilling to support spending reductions of the magnitude called for in the budget outline, the Republican leadership succeeded in pushing the measure through by a 216 to 204 vote after a contentious debate and intense arm-twisting. 
 The House plan calls for about $100 billion in tax cuts in the next five years, offset by spending cuts of the same amount. The primary tax cut would be a reduction in the so-called marriage penalty, the provision in the tax code that requires many two-income couples to pay more than they would if they were single.
The plan must be reconciled with a version passed by the Senate that calls for $30 billion in tax cuts and keeps spending largely on the path agreed to by Congress and President Clinton in last year's balanced budget deal. Even after the House and Senate have resolved their differences, the resulting budget plan will not become law but rather will serve as a general guide for drafting spending and tax bills.
The House decided today to increase military spending slightly before accounting for inflation, but to reduce domestic spending substantially. The plan did not specify what programs would be cut from the budget, which will total $1.7 trillion next year, and postponed most of the reductions until later years.
Speaker Newt Gingrich, who worked the House floor until the final moments to insure that wavering moderates voted "yes," said it was clear that the House would have to move in the Senate's direction, diluting somewhat the party's ideological message. House members were also under pressure from many governors to soften provisions that would cut promised welfare block grants to the states.
"We'll be maybe slightly less conservative by the time we're done with the Senate," Mr. Gingrich said after the vote. "The Senate will be a good bit more conservative by the time they're done with us."
But a split-the-difference compromise with the Senate, yielding tax and spending cuts of about $60 billion over the next five years, would put the Republicans into a potentially bruising fight with the White House and Congressional Democrats heading into the fall election campaign.
Despite the prospect of huge budget surpluses for years to come, the two parties were having much the same argument they had two years ago when they expected deficits as far as the eye could see.
In his budget proposal early this year, Mr. Clinton called for more than $100 billion of new spending programs in education, child care and health care, paid for in part by revenues that the White House hopes will be generated by anti-smoking legislation that may pass Congress. Mr. Clinton's budget called for $20 billion of narrowly specified tax cuts.
"After a tough, tight and successful balanced budget plan that is clearly working, this plan reflects an arbitrary desire to cut key areas like education, health care and the environment with little if any analysis of what could really be negative impacts on key priorities," Gene Sperling, the White House economic policy adviser, said of the House proposal.
Moreover, Democratic strategists said, today's vote could give Democrats potent ammunition in their effort to win back control of the House by putting some moderate Republicans in crucial districts on record as favoring what their Democratic opponents in the mid-term elections will portray as extreme cuts.
Still, conservative Republicans seemed to be spoiling for another ideological fight. After having seen their fervor for smaller Government dissipate last year under pressure to reach a budget-balancing compromise with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gingrich and his lieutenants were eager to reassert their conservative credentials before the elections.
"We don't want to forget the reason people sent us here," said Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the Budget Committee and the main author of the Republican plan. "We came to make the Government budget smaller and the family budget bigger."
Mr. Kasich said the spending cuts in his plan amounted to "a penny on the dollar" and were essential to break Washington's tax-and-spend culture.
But Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee, said the proposed cuts would fall almost entirely on social programs.
And Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said the Republican budget was a replay of the 1995 plan that led to a showdown with Mr. Clinton and a shutdown of the Federal Government. The Republican proposals, Mr. Gephardt said, were "expired milk poured into new cartons."
The most conservative Republicans had pressed for $150 billion in tax and spending cuts. Although the Republican leadership came up with the needed votes, some moderates said they were voting for the plan only reluctantly, fearing that the combination of big tax cuts and unspecified future spending reductions imposed too much of a strain on legitimate Government programs and risked the nation's newfound fiscal health.
"It's like taking out a 30-day note to pay for your dream house that you want to live in for the rest of your life," said Representative Amo Houghton, Republican of New York.
In the floor debate, Mr. Gingrich appealed to party loyalty and warned potential dissidents not to distance themselves from the party's accomplishments of the last few years.
"If you vote against the Kasich budget, you're voting against the team that reformed welfare, the team that cut taxes, the team that balanced the budget, the team that brought discretionary spending under control," he said. "And I think that's wrong."

HEADLINE: Finances Worry Neutrino Researchers

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE 

DATELINE: TAKAYAMA, Japan, Saturday, June 6

 BODY:
As Japanese and American scientists basked in the glow of their monumental discovery of neutrino mass, announced here on Friday, a financial cloud that could hamper future research hung over the 120-member team today.
Through the team's leader, Dr. Yoji Totsuka, the scientists appealed for the Japanese Government's reconsideration of major cuts in financing for the Kamioka Neutrino Observatory, where the discovery of neutrino mass was made. Many of the 300 physicists attending an international neutrino meeting here predicted privately that the discovery could eventually be rewarded with one or more Nobel Prizes. 
 But the Government has been unsympathetic, Dr. Totsuka said in an interview. Faced with severe budget problems, he said, the Government has reduced the Kamioka group's spending by 15 percent and threatens another 15 percent cut next year.
"This may mean shutting down the detector for up to six months, which would have devastating effects on our research," Dr. Totsuka said.
The experiment announced on Friday demonstrated that neutrinos, created by the impact of cosmic rays on the earth's upper atmosphere, "oscillate," or change from one type to another as they reach the ground and pass through the earth. With this discovery, the observatory demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that neutrinos have mass.
That will require revision of the generally accepted theory of the structure of matter, which is made of quarks, leptons and force-carrying particles. Depending on how large the still-unmeasured mass of neutrinos may be, they could prove to be a significant proportion of the mass of the universe, perhaps accounting for some of the "dark matter" that has not been seen directly but exerts large gravitational effects.
An American member of the Kamioka research collaboration, Dr. James Stone of Boston University, said its big underground neutrino detector, Super-Kamiokande, was investigating a range of major physics problems other than the search for neutrino oscillations on earth.
One project explores the possibility that protons -- building blocks of matter -- may decay. Super-Kamiokande, essentially a water tank the size of a 10-story building deep under western Japan's mountains near here, is also looking for an explanation of the deficit in neutrinos detected from the sun, a problem not solved by Friday's announcement.
The detector also continuously looks for bursts of neutrinos coming from supernova explosions and peculiar explosions called "gamma ray bursters," which may be the most violent events in the universe.
In 1987, the nearest supernova in 400 years exploded in a nearby galaxy, and at almost the same moment that the supernova appeared as a dot of light visible from the Southern Hemisphere, a neutrino detector in Ohio and the Kamioka observatory in Japan picked up a strong neutrino pulse.
The achievement marked the debut of neutrino astronomy.
Dr. James W. Cronin of the University of Chicago, one of the Nobel laureates at the neutrino conference here, called the cuts in financing for the Kamioka observatory alarming and said he would join in an appeal to the Japanese Government.
Another Nobel Prize winner here, Dr. Sheldon L. Glashow of Harvard University, said support for physics research was endangered in many countries.
"Sweden is threatening to withdraw from CERN for financial reasons," he said, "and that could have a ripple effect reducing the financial commitment of other European nations to the coalition."
CERN, the acronym for Europe's high-energy-physics consortium, is building what will be the world's most powerful accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, in a circular tunnel near Geneva. Congress canceled an even larger accelerator that had been under construction in Texas, but, with American scientists still hoping to work at the cutting edge of particle research, the United States has become a partner in building the European collider.
Major reductions in support of CERN by European nations could delay the new accelerator and other large programs, including those designed to explore the question of neutrino oscillations and mass. One such experiment would direct an intense beam of neutrinos from one of the CERN accelerators near Geneva through the ground about 450 miles to a neutrino detector inside a vehicular tunnel under the Gran Sasso Mountain in northern Italy. The idea is to see whether any neutrinos change type during their long trip through the earth's crust.
"Sometimes the accidents of politics and economics help science," said Dr. Barry C. Barish of the California Institute of Technology, who uses a detector in the Gran Sasso tunnel. "The tunnel was built because local politicians persuaded the Government to appropriate a large sum for infrastructure, and there was a problem finding something to spend it on. The tunnel proved to be a boon for physicists who needed the mountain above it to shield their experiments from unwanted cosmic rays."
American members of the Super-Kamiokande team said they planned to send a letter to the Japanese Government pleading for steady support of the observatory.
"American scientists greatly benefited from the Japanese Government's generosity," Dr. Stone said. "Japan paid for most of the $100 million construction cost of Super-Kamiokande, and the United States put up less than 10 percent, and yet American physicists make up half the research force. We hope the Japanese Government will allow uninterrupted operation of this great scientific instrument."

Stocks Rally Sharply On Vibrant Economy News
The stock market roared back to life yesterday after the Government said that economic growth remained robust, despite the problems posed by Asia's slowdown. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, after weeks of sluggish trading, rose 167.15 points, or 1.88 percent, to close at 9,037.71, its biggest surge in four months. Broader market indicators also shot higher. Page D3.
 
Consumer Borrowing Surges
The pace of borrowing by consumers more than doubled in April to $5.5 billion, compared with a month earlier, to total $1.25 trillion, the Federal Reserve reported. D2.
 
G.M. Workers Strike
A strike over job security by 3,400 General Motors workers halted work at a components factory in Flint, Mich. The strike could cripple production at 17 of G.M.'s 29 North American production factories within a week. The two sides, which faced a similarly tense labor showdown in 1997, when seven different strikes were staged at factories across the country, were scheduled to negotiate today. A7.
 
Shift in Internet Control
The Clinton Administration said it would turn over the management of the Internet's address system to an international nonprofit group. The decision would remove the last vestige of control by the United States Government over the structure of the global computer network. Management of Internet addresses has become the focus of heated debates and litigation. A1.
 
House Passes Deeper Tax Cut Plan
The House narrowly approved a plan to cut taxes and spending far more deeply than last year's bipartisan balanced budget deal. The House plan calls for about $100 billion in tax cuts in the next five years, offset by spending cuts of the same amount. The primary tax cut would be a reduction in the so-called marriage penalty, the provision in the tax code that requires many two-income couples to pay more than they would if they were single. A9.
 
VW Backed for Rolls Purchase
Shareholders of Vickers voted overwhelmingly to sell Rolls-Royce Motor Cars to Volkswagen for $703 million, rejecting bids from BMW and a group of Rolls enthusiasts, who had hoped to keep the famed luxury car brand in British hands. The deal still needs the approval of Rolls-Royce P.L.C., the aircraft engine company, over use of the Rolls name. D2.
 
No Further Cuts, Motorola Says
The chief executive of Motorola, Charles Galvin, said it did not expect any additional job cuts beyond its announced plans to eliminate 15,000 positions, or 10 percent of its work force, in the next year. Mr. Galvin also said the company, a leading maker of cellular phones and pagers, expects the semiconductor market to shrink by 2 percent this year, a sharp contrast to forecasts of a 17 percent growth rate at the beginning of the year. D3.
 
Belgian Bank Bidding Brawl
Fortis Group raised its bid for Generale de Banque to about $13.4 billion, topping a $12.6 billion offer from ABN Amro Holding N.V. The move elevated the intensity of an unusual bidding battle to form one of Europe's biggest financial services companies in advance of European monetary union next year. D2.
 
Vivendi Sells Electrafina Stake
Vivendi, the French municipal services, media and telecommunications conglomerate formerly known as Compagnie Generale des Eaux, sold its 24.6 percent interest in Electrafina, an energy and communications company, to Groupe Bruxelles Lambert for $1.2 billion. D14.
 
Auto Makers Criticize Crash Tests
American, European and Japanese auto makers told a safety conference that increasingly high-speed Government and insurance industry crash tests were preventing auto engineers from designing sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and large cars that would be less dangerous to other motorists. A7.

HEADLINE: Spending Plan Council Adopted Is Similar to Mayor's

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
Except for huge personal income tax cuts, the $34.08 billion budget that the City Council passed yesterday -- the first in the city's history that was approved without the agreement of the Mayor -- included relatively modest changes from a plan Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed only weeks ago.
The Democratic-controlled Council made the tax cut the highlight of the budget -- which passed 43 to 7 -- slashing $201 million next fiscal year and more than $500 million in the years after that. 
 Budget experts said that the greatest impact of the Council's plan will be on the city's long-term fiscal condition, because the tax cuts would permanently eliminate a significant source of revenue.
Mr. Giuliani said the Council's plan would hurt the city's health into the new millennium because it would widen the gap between revenues and expenses.
But Speaker Peter F. Vallone trumpeted many of the changes that the Council, at his urging, implemented for the new fiscal year, which begins on July 1.
Holding up a battered wooden seat from a public school, Mr. Vallone said he thought it was more important to replace students' chairs "than worrying about where and what kind of seats we're going to have and what kind of luxury boxes we're going to have in Yankee Stadium."
The Council's plan added $4 million to buy furniture for public schools. The Council also increased appropriations for a host of other agencies, including $22 million for libraries, $28 million for the Administration for Children's Services, $18 million for cultural affairs, $7.6 million for parks and about $5.5 million each for city hospitals and for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
In a separate budget for capital projects, the city would borrow $100 million to buy gas furnaces for public schools with coal furnaces. To finance that project, the Council killed several of the Mayor's capital projects, including a $65 million contribution to the privately owned Museum of Modern Art.
However, the budget could change over the next few weeks. While the Mayor can veto part or all of the spending plan the Council approved, Mr. Vallone demonstrated yesterday that he clearly had the support to override a veto, an action that would require a two-thirds vote of the Council's 51 members.
But Mr. Giuliani has also said he is prepared to impound city funds, if necessary, to block the Council budget, a move that would likely end up pitting the two sides against one another in court.
Last night, just hours after Council members gathered to cheer their new budget in the City Hall rotunda, Mr. Giuliani showed how his mayoral powers can throw the Council's plan in disarray.
Under the City Charter, the Mayor reveals what the city can expect in non-property tax revenues only after the Council adopts a budget. Essentially, that means that the Mayor can determine how much money the city will have to spend next year. In its budget, the Council was forced to use tax revenue estimates that the Mayor included in a plan he proposed a month ago.
Last night, the Mayor announced that he expected the city to receive less in taxes than he had anticipated a month ago, a move that could force the Council to agree to spending cuts or to raise the property tax, the one tax it controls.
Council officials accused the Mayor of acting purely out of political vindictiveness, adding that all government fiscal monitors reported that they expected higher tax revenues than the Mayor predicted last month.
"If the Mayor reduces revenues -- contrary to what the City Comptroller and the State Comptroller and the other monitors say -- he's putting the city at fiscal risk," said Bruce R. Bender, Mr. Vallone's chief of staff.
The Mayor has trained his criticism at the plan's long-term impact. City spending is growing faster than revenues, and Mr. Giuliani said the Council's budget means widening deficits by more than $2.2 billion in the years 2000 to 2002. . He added that the Council had tried to cover those future gaps through an unrealistically rosy prediction of the tax revenues the city will collect through 2002.
"This assumes that Wall Street continues to function precisely the way it is and grows over the next three to four years," the Mayor said, "that there is no drop, that for the first time in the history of Wall Street or America, there will be no downturn in our economy at all, at any time in the next three to four years.
"This newest thing that they've done, where they just start pulling revenues out of the air on the assumption that the economy is going to continue to grow at record levels, is a highly irresponsible thing to do," Mr. Giuliani added in a news conference, clutching at the air with his right hand.
Alan G. Hevesi, the City Comptroller, said the Council's plan would increase the deficits, but by about $767 million.
Council officials said future deficits would actually shrink under their plan.
Douglas A. Criscitello, director of the city's Independent Budget Office, said that, except for the personal income tax cuts, the Council's plan hewed to Mr. Giuliani's proposal from a month earlier. The Council's budget calls for about $49 million less in spending than the Mayor's.
"It's not a huge departure from what the Mayor proposed," Mr. Criscitello said. "It's close to what a negotiated budget would look like if negotiations had occurred."
The Council's budget drew praise from many lobbyists and advocates who have been milling inside City Hall this week.
"The Council should be commended for their first budget, which clearly puts children first and encourages working families to work and raise their children in New York City," said Rose Anello, associate executive director of the Citizens' Committee for Children. "It enhances programs that support family life, like after-school programs that will enable working parents to work and not worry about their children."

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt Up Again

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5

 BODY:
Borrowing by United States consumers grew at a faster pace in April than it did in March, the Federal Reserve reported today. Borrowing rose $5.5 billion in April, to $1.250 trillion, after rising a revised $2 billion in March. Previously, the Fed had said that March borrowing was up $1 billion. Before today's report, analysts had expected an increase of $4 billion for April. Consumer credit has moderated considerably from high levels that persisted from late 1993 through most of 1996. Credit card borrowing rose $2.3 billion in April, after increasing a revised $500 million in March, previously reported as a $600 million rise.

HEADLINE: Jobs Surged By 300,000 Last Month

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Despite Asian tremors, stock market jitters and fears that America is running out of workers, the economy is still booming. In May, the Labor Department reported yesterday, employers added nearly 300,000 new jobs, unemployment held steady at an almost unbelievably low 4.3 percent -- the lowest rate in 28 years -- and pay continued to rise.
"The U.S. economy has never performed as well," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. "Asia is taking a big bite out of U.S. exports, but domestic demand has stayed very strong." 
 Investors focused on the optimistic side, reasoning that such a show of economic strength bodes well for corporate profits. The stock market rallied yesterday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up nearly 2 percent, its best gain in four months.
The May jobs figures are only the latest evidence that the economy remains far more robust than most experts expected. Spending on everything from new homes and cars to business equipment has been soaring in recent weeks.
Indeed, the surge in hiring surprised economists who were expecting the unemployment rate to tick up in May and payrolls to rise only modestly. What is more, the Labor Department reported that the job market was stronger in March and April than had previously been reported.
The best labor market since the go-go 1960's is a boon for most Americans who are now enjoying signing bonuses, more frequent raises and, not least, the luxury of choice. The quit rate -- a measure of how confident workers are that they can trade their old job for a better one -- has been hovering close to its highest level since the beginning of the economic expansion seven years ago
Although a tight labor market also increases the possibility that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool the economy, wage inflation is hardly surging. Hourly earnings are now 4.3 percent above their level a year ago. After rising 5 cents in April, earnings edged up another 4 cents, to $12.73.
The sole weak spot in the job market is in industry. Asia's problems have been hitting American exporters hard since the beginning of the year, contributing to a big buildup in inventories and cutbacks in production.
As a result, manufacturers have started to rein in head counts. Factory payrolls, which grew by more than 300,000 in the last two years, shrank for the second consecutive month -- by 26,000.
Indeed, all of the hiring -- 332,000 jobs -- last month was by the dominant service sector, which includes everything from Wall Street and shopping malls to trucking and management consulting firms.
What is fueling the demand for workers -- including, increasingly, the young, inexperienced and least educated -- is not much of a mystery. American businesses and households are on a spending spree that shows few signs of abating and promises to keep the job market tight for the foreseeable future. Consumers are spending more freely than ever, as jammed parking lots at shopping malls and the latest reports from merchants confirm. Just this week Detroit's auto makers reported that May was their best sales month in a dozen years. On Thursday, big retailers reported a 7.1 percent rise in May sales after a gain of 10.2 percent in April, the best monthly increase in 10 years.
It is no surprise, then, that retailers added 89,000 new jobs in May, the second big consecutive increase.
Americans are also buying houses. April home sales were the strongest in history. And furniture, hardware and other items for the home are moving briskly. The decline of 9,000 jobs in construction in May probably reflects the unusual weather patterns of the last few months and comes after builders hired 204,000 workers between October and April.
There is no sign that households are tapped out. Partly because of that hot job market, household income is swelling at a rate that is unusually high by historical standards, nearly 5 percent a year. With inflation running close to 1 percent, if that, "a dollar is a dollar" these days.
The other spur to spending is coming from the stock market, which has quadrupled in value over the last eight years. Half of all Americans have some stake in the market, and they are the ones with most of the disposable income. An economic rule of thumb holds that consumers spend approximately 3 percent of their increase in wealth. That rule seems to be holding now. The personal savings rate has declined from 6.5 percent to 3.5 percent in the last five years; that is an indirect measure of the wealth effect -- $200 billion-plus in extra spending.
Businesses are also spending as if there were no tomorrow. Purchases of new equipment and structures have been booming almost since the beginning of the expansion and show no signs of slowing.
One reason for all the investment is that high stock prices and low interest rates make it more affordable. Equipment orders suggest that investment spending, while it may have slowed a bit from its rise of 27 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, is still increasing at a double-digit rate.
But while there is no evidence yet that domestic demand is slowing, some drags on growth are already visible. The trade deficit -- which shaved 1.5 percentage points off the economic growth rate in the first quarter -- is expected to widen from the aftereffects of the Asian crisis. "We're going to have a slowdown but there's no reason for it to happen quickly," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Primark Decision Economics.
The unemployment rate of Americans with college degrees has been hovering around 1.5 percent for some time, but the biggest decline in joblessness over the last year has been among high school dropouts. "They're the only ones left to hire," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's DRI, an economic forecasting firm.
Slower economic growth may not mean that it will become harder to find a job or to get a raise. With the pool of unemployed dwindling and growth in the labor force slow, unemployment is likely to stay low even if the economy expands at just half the recent pace. Thus, said Robert Mellman, chief economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, "people will still feel great."

HEADLINE: Rising Storm in the Balkans

 BODY:
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia is incorrigible. Forced to accept peace in Bosnia, he is now uprooting thousands of ethnic Albanians from the Serbian province of Kosovo. His military campaign, the largest since the end of the Bosnian war, threatens to ignite a wider conflict in the Balkans. America and its European allies urgently need to increase the pressure on Mr. Milosevic to desist.
For the last week, Serbian security forces using helicopters and heavy artillery have terrorized ethnic Albanian civilians near Kosovo's border with Albania. Their ostensible objective is to cut off escape routes used by the Kosovo Liberation Army, an ethnic Albanian guerrilla group that has gained strength in proportion to the brutality of Mr. Milosevic's repression. Kosovo's 1.8 million ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the province's population. They have been denied civil rights since Mr. Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989. 
 Mr. Milosevic's brutal tactics could draw Albania into the conflict. Macedonia, with a large Albanian minority, could also face pressure to intervene. It is even conceivable that Turkey and Greece might enter the conflict as well. American security interests could quickly come into play in such a Balkan brawl. Washington must proceed promptly to reinstate the sanctions it lifted a few weeks ago when Mr. Milosevic agreed to meetings with Kosovo Albanian leaders. It is now clear that he had no intention of conducting those talks in good faith.
Unfortunately, because of Russian sympathies for Serbia, the international sanctions are mild and may do little to persuade Mr. Milosevic to refrain from further violence. America and its European allies need to consider stronger measures. President Clinton has properly declined to rule out a military response if the violence escalates.
Mr. Milosevic's habit is to maul his opponents as long as the rest of the world lets him. When the pain of economic sanctions becomes severe and the threat of force is real, he thinks about retreat. He should know from the NATO bombing campaign that forced him to the peace table in Bosnia that Washington's patience is not infinite.

HEADLINE: A Return to the Old Ball Game;
Minor Leagues Capitalize on Nostalgia for Sport as It Was

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: MONTCLAIR, N.J., June 5

 BODY:
They filled the brand new Yogi Berra Stadium tonight to watch a team that did not exist until this year and that plays in a league few have even heard of.
No matter. The game was baseball, and for the fans who turned out to see the fledgling New Jersey Jackals take on the Albany-Colonie Diamond Dogs, that was enough to fill every seat. 
 Minor league baseball, a game that used to evoke images of languid summer afternoons on pine board bleachers in some smiley rural corner, has moved in force into the teeming suburbs of metropolitan New York. It is nourished by nostalgia for a simpler version of a game dominated by major league millionaires, and is financed by wealthy businessmen with time and money to play out a childhood dream.
Since 1994, 15 professional minor league teams, of widely varying quality and affiliation, have been formed or have moved into the populous region loosely bounded by Albany, Hartford and Trenton.
At their home opener tonight, the Jackals had Mr. Berra himself, the baseball sage and their stadium's namesake, to throw out the first ball. But he was perhaps the only link to the more famous franchise in the Bronx, and that seemed to suit the fans just fine.
"I'm 15 minutes from home, I bought a season ticket for $8 a game and I'm practically sitting on the field," said George Rauth, who brought his 8-year-old grandson. "It would cost me $8 just to park at Yankee Stadium." (It's $6, to be precise.)
In fact, major league owners helped create the minor league boom by forcing their farm teams to acquire newer, safer stadiums or move. Municipalities, eager for new tax revenue or just hoping to put a few more people on downtown streets after dark, have courted the new teams with money and tax breaks.
Nine new stadiums have been built in the region since 1994, and if Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani gets his way, two more teams -- farm clubs for the Yankees and Mets -- will move into new $20 million stadiums in Coney Island and Staten Island.
It does not seem to matter to fans if the level of play is often short of major, with a mix of aging journeymen and talented but inexperienced youngsters filling the rosters. It doesn't even matter if the noble sport of Maris and DiMaggio, Hodges and Alou has to share billing with the noisy hucksterism of the Dizzy Bat Race, the R.W. Auto Tire T-shirt Slingshot and the Jiffy-Lube Lucky Seat Giveaway.
"I think the response bears out the notion that this region was underserved until now," said Michael McGuire, executive director of the Northeast League, of which the Jackals are a member.
"People will generally drive about 20 miles to go to a minor league game, and when you look at New York and New Jersey and Connecticut, you can find millions of people living that close to a ball park," he said. "From a business perspective, it's like putting in a retail chain."
So the Hudson Valley Renegades, in Fishkill, N.Y., sold out every game last year except for one on Labor Day, even though they had one of the worst records in the New York-Penn League, which has ties to the majors. The Trenton Thunder, which moved to New Jersey from London, Ontario, in 1994, have been first or second in attendance in the double-A Eastern League for the last three years, drawing 446,000 fans last year.
Nationally, the 172 minor league baseball clubs affiliated with Major League Baseball sold 34.7 million tickets last year, compared with 30 million in 1950, when there were 400 teams.
Yogi Berra Stadium was built by Floyd Hall, the chairman of the Kmart Corporation and a resident of Montclair, who spent $15 million on the ball park and an attached complex of two ice rinks. The ball park is on the campus of Montclair State College, whose baseball team will use the stadium in the spring, before the Jackals begin their 84-game season.
Only five of the region's 15 new teams -- the Trenton Thunder, the New Jersey Cardinals, the Hudson Valley Renegades, the Norwich Navigators and the New Haven Ravens -- are affiliated with the major leagues, which has trademarked the term "Minor League Baseball." The others belong either to the three-year-old Northeast League, or this year's rookie, the Atlantic League, whose five teams have only three stadiums among them. The affiliated teams are somewhat disdainful of the independent teams, while the majors insist that none of the lower-echelon teams draw fans away from big league play.
Why the sudden interest? Team owners and club managers point to a robust economy, the bargain basement admission prices and easy access. Above all, they credit the mood of baby boomers as their nests fill up.
"I don't want to sound too philosophical, but for years our society had gotten away from the family doing things together, and people want to get back to that," said Peter Kirk, a partner in three minor league teams in Maryland who is recognized as an expert in marketing minor league baseball. "It's nostalgia for the old ball game, and minor league baseball is just tapping in to that. It's something the family can do together."
A 1990 crackdown by major league owners on aging minor league ball parks also played a part. That year, the majors adopted the Facilities Standards Rule that spelled out in detail what a minor league stadium should look like, from the design of the grandstands and the location of concession stands down to the brightness of field lighting and the number of toilets. Teams that could not comply were forced to move, and as a result Albany lost the Albany-Colonie Yankees to Norwich, Connecticut, where they became the Navigators.
Almost all affiliated minor league stadiums now have picnic areas and playgrounds for restless children, for example. A simple rule like requiring that access to the area under the grandstands be closed to the public suddenly relieved parents of a major worry about letting their children wander off alone, Mr. Kirk said.
"Prior to 1985, when people really started thinking about minor league ball parks, the parks in this country were community facilities that were built for the purpose of playing ball, and not much else," Mr. Kirk said. "The fan portions of these parks were very Spartan -- typically a bleacher section and a few restrooms and food service tucked underneath."
Baseball realized that the old parks were fine for die-hard baseball fans, Mr. Kirk said, but not much more. "We started to realize that there was a whole segment of our communities that were not coming out to these minor league games, or only occasionally, because they were not terribly interested in baseball," he said.
So the leagues began to do some market research. They asked people if they were baseball fans, and almost everyone said yes. Then they asked the self-described fans more probing questions -- to name other teams in their hometown league, for instance, or the pitchers on an opposing team's roster.
"The true fans could do that, but most people couldn't," Mr. Kirk said. "So we knew that if you're a casual fan, you want a ball park that is clean and comfortable, and where, if your kids get antsy after about the third inning, you feel fine about letting them wander around. There is nothing under the grandstands, and you can sit in your seat and watch your kids, or you can go to playgrounds and hang out at the edge of the swings and still watch the game."
What the casual fans get for the $2 parking and $8 box seats is an intimate ball park with seating for 4,000 fans that is so close to the game that the manager's hollering reaches the stands, along with an atmosphere intended to have almost as much circus as baseball to it. Children race the clumsy mascot around the bases between innings (the mascot always loses), comedy acts like Myron Noodleman, professional nerd, or Brackney's Mad Cap Mutts entertain during the seventh-inning stretch, and commercial promotions erupt at all times under the guise of crowd participation games.
So Trenton Thunder fans clapped heartily Wednesday when Joe DePastino hit a home run against the woeful Reading Phillies -- but they screamed and leaped to their feet when Thunder personnel got ready to slingshot a tire company's T-shirt into the seats.
"A lot of what we do here is comedy, because to tell the truth, a lot of the people we get are not really baseball fans -- that's what I've found," said Tony Torre, general manager of the New Jersey Cardinals, a farm team of the National League's St. Louis Cardinals, which moved to New Jersey from Hamilton, Ontario, in 1994.
"They come here and they see a dog catching Frisbees between innings" -- that would be Mr. Brackney and his dogs -- "and you give all the kids a baseball bat and that kind of makes it for them," he said.
Some fans at tonight's game in Montclair also brought bitter memories of the 1994 baseball strike and its canceled World Series. Winfield and Tracy Parsons, sitting in the $6 bench seats, came in part to show their sons Scott and Daniel a game played by hungry young dreamers earning an average of $900 a month.
"I have absolutely had it with the majors, a bunch of overpaid crybabies," said Mr. Parsons, who teaches at Montclair State College. "I want my kids to start getting their baseball experience in a place like this."
Mrs. Parsons favored the practical. "Where else can I take my family out for an evening of good, clean fun for $26? The movies cost more than this."

Moody's Plans to Review Its Ratings for Malaysia

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service said yesterday that it might cut Malaysia's credit ratings, warning that the nation's economy will contract this year and cause bad loans to surge amid higher interest rates. The ratings company in New York placed Malaysia's foreign currency rating for bonds and notes and rating for bank deposits on review for possible downgrade. 
 Any lowered rating will make it more expensive for Malaysia to raise money overseas. Malaysia's economy shrank 1.8 percent in the first quarter, its first contraction since 1985.

HEADLINE: Let U.S. Companies Use Chinese Rockets;
Not NASA's Fault

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Gregg Easterbrook (Op-Ed, June 2) is justified in chastising the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for failing to develop low-cost space launchers. But that has little or nothing to do with the launching of United States commercial satellites on Chinese rockets. Chinese rockets are cheap because China still does not operate as a free-market economy. Thus China's agencies can -- and do -- charge whatever they please for products or services they wish to promote. 
 Also, our satellite builders use commercial rockets like those from China because NASA hasn't been permitted to launch any commercial satellites since 1986, after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, not, as Mr. Easterbrook says, because of NASA's high launching costs.

HEADLINE: About New York;
Camera Shy, But on Stage For 3 Brands

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
THE Mendez triplets from Woodside, Queens, are camera shy. This is unfortunate, because their father loves photography. It is also too bad, because their names have a certain quality that courts exposure. In fact, although they just graduated from college yesterday, their names are already in lights and on billboards throughout the world.
And on a few million cameras, too.
They are their own camera club: Konica, Leica and Minolta Mendez. 
 Before they were born 20 years ago in the Philippines, their father, Manuel, so liked a fine German camera that he picked the name Leica for a daughter. When triplets arrived, he added Konica and Minolta to the mix. Nikon was a brief contender, but grandma nixed it. You wonder what would have happened if he had liked, say, the Three Stooges or three-card monte.
It's a little easier for them to live in Queens, where their German, Japanese and Spanish names are just a few more exotic monikers in the melting pot. At least they're not saddled with the expectations placed on two brothers who were named Winner and Loser, according to a police officer who swore he worked with them in upper Manhattan years ago. Imagine, forever knowing which one mom liked best.
The Mendez sisters suffer no such envy.
"He thought we were special because we were triplets," Leica said. "It's like a double joy to have triplets, so he named us after something he liked."
The triplets said they were living in Bahrain when they first got an inkling their names were different. Their father had moved the family there to take a job in graphic design. They were about 10 years old when they were given what was otherwise a routine project.
"In school, we were asked what the meanings of our names were," Leica said. "We were named after products. That annoyed me a bit because I couldn't go up in front of the class and talk about what my name meant."
The sisters got used to the reaction, which in some cases was quizzical, but not for the expected reason.
"The problem was that everybody knew what Konica and Minolta was, but not Leica," said Leica, she of the high-end name. "I used to be bothered by that."
Her sisters nodded, then they broke into one another's sentences as in a tag-team interview. "In the Philippines," Minolta said, "I had more renown as a photocopier."
There was a different reaction when they moved to Woodside a few years ago and enrolled in Queensborough Community College. In a consumer society, people know from brands. Konica and Leica, fine arts majors, had to put up with incessant cracks from classmates who wanted to know if they were into photography.
Said Leica: "I hate cameras."
Minolta became a business and marketing major, naturally, since she had been pitching a product since birth. But brand recognition often led some teachers to assume she was Japanese.
"My economics professor, the first time he heard my name, he didn't stop talking about the Japanese economy," Minolta said. "When we talked about the economy of Japan, they always talked about products like Minolta cameras. It's funny, but my sales and marketing teacher never mentioned anything to me about my name."
AMONG themselves, they call one another Koni and Mini, although Leica is short enough. All in all, the sisters said their names had given them the advantage of making an unforgettable impression on whomever they met.
"It's cool," Minolta said. "People say if they have triplets they would name them after products like Mercury, Ford and some other car."
But there have been those times when they longed for something just a little plainer. Konica is partial to Marie or Claire. Minolta was keen on Mary for a while. That just might be what they call their children someday.
"Normal names," Leica insisted. "They're not going to go through having some weird names."
When the sisters graduated yesterday, many shutterbugs in the audience toted their namesakes. Their father, however, did not, since he replaced the Leica that inspired his imagination. "He uses a Contax now," said Leica, who wants to go into advertising after finishing college. "They say it's better than a Leica."
With that, she displayed the kind of brand loyalty that will serve her well when she starts her advertising career.
"I want to give Leica a kick in the butt, for lagging behind," she said. "What's up with that? Keep up your reputation."

HEADLINE: D'Amato Stirs State G.O.P And Borrows Some Themes

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
Six years after vowing not to run for office again, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato accepted the unanimous nomination of state Republican Party leaders for a fourth term yesterday, then launched into a rousing speech salted with traditionally Democratic themes and appeals to crossover voters.
On the concluding day of the party's two-day convention in Manhattan, Mr. D'Amato's high-test performance seemed intended to energize party workers who had grown bored with the crisply orchestrated event and to remind his supporters about the dangers of complacency, particularly when the top of their ticket, Gov. George E. Pataki, is well ahead in opinion polls. 
 Still, Mr. D'Amato seemed supremely confident, strutting into the convention hall like a triumphant homecoming king to the brassy strains of the theme to "Rocky."
Then, as party operatives led raucous chants of "Six more years" and "Al gets it done," Mr. D'Amato recounted a list of accomplishments that he said made him the most effective Senator in Congress -- from getting mass transit funds for New York City to helping women with breast cancer to closing a polluting incinerator in Nassau County. It seemed clear from his speech and those nominating him that effectiveness would be a core theme for his campaign.
"Day in and day out, people are saying: 'You know what? We may not agree with Al D'Amato on lots of issues -- even my mother doesn't -- but you want to know something? He is a fighter, he cares for the people, he makes a difference,' " said Mr. D'Amato, who discarded his prepared text to speak extemporaneously for much of the speech.
Also yesterday, the delegates unanimously nominated Bruce A. Blakeman, the Presiding Officer of the Nassau County Legislature, for state comptroller.
On Thursday, the convention nominated Mr. Pataki for a second term as Governor; Mary O. Donohue, a State Supreme Court justice, for lieutenant governor; and Dennis C. Vacco for a second term as Attorney General. Unlike the Democrats, who are facing primaries for every statewide seat except comptroller, the Republicans will have none.
Though the hall at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers was filled with party officials from across the state, Mr. D'Amato's remarks in many ways seemed intended for an audience outside the building: the centrist, suburban swing voters who could determine the outcome of a close race.
His 30-minute speech was notably devoid of any attacks on the Democratic Party or the three Democrats seeking to run against him -- Geraldine A. Ferraro, Mark Green and Charles E. Schumer. Though he made passing reference to traditional Republican issues like crime and taxes, he talked more emotionally about fighting for the environment, against insurance companies and on behalf of women. There was no mention of abortion, which Mr. D'Amato would ban, and no attacks on the New York State United Teachers, the powerful teachers' union, which he had made a target months before.
"I don't care whether it's Democrats or Republicans that I have to work on, and with," he said. "Party politics should not stop us from doing the business of the people."
But Mr. D'Amato's would-be Democratic rivals derided the Republican's bipartisanship and centrist talk as hollow opportunism. Mr. Schumer, a Congressman from Brooklyn and Queens, accused Mr. D'Amato of aligning himself with "right-wing extremists" in Congress to cut Medicare and education funding and block gun control. Ms. Ferraro, the former Congresswoman and Vice-Presidential candidate, described him as "squarely in the pocket of the special interests."
And Mr. Green, the New York City Public Advocate, said, "We need a senator who thinks that economic security is more than an overflowing campaign war chest." Mr. D'Amato has raised more than $17 million for his campaign.
Mr. D'Amato called the attacks on his ethics "nonsense."
"Al D'Amato helps his friends -- oh, shocking," he said with mock horror to the delegates. "That must be something that is anti-American. Well let me tell you something. If a friend comes and if an industry that is vital to New York and to this nation needs help, you better believe it I'm going to stand up."
Having said near the end of the grueling 1992 campaign that he would not run again, Mr. D'Amato was asked today if this was his last race. "I'm never going to say that again," he replied, laughing.

SPEEDING THE NET
 The Inside Story of
 Netscape and How It Challenged Microsoft.
 By Joshua Quittner
 and Michelle Slatalla.
 323 pp. New York:
 Atlantic Monthly Press. $25. 
 A fascinating story lies behind Justice Department-embattled Microsoft's trouncing of the Netscape Communications Corporation, the scrappy software start-up whose groundbreaking Navigator program helped popularize the World Wide Web. Unfortunately, that tale doesn't begin until at least halfway through "Speeding the Net," an expert but long-winded account by the husband-and-wife team of Joshua Quittner and Michelle Slatalla.
The book's first half details the rise of Marc Andreessen, Navigator's pudgy primary programmer. He and his workaholic hacker friends make entertaining, if cliched, characters. Their cars are filled with greasy fast-food wrappers. They rail in E-mail flame wars. They spend weeks at their keyboards with little in the way of showers, exercise or items from the fruit-and-vegetable food group.
Both Quittner and Slatalla are computer columnists: he writes for Time magazine, and she is a contributor to the Circuits section of The New York Times. They do their best to enliven this protracted prologue, writing in a colloquial, thriller-like style and striving to turn software demos into drama and buttoned-down executives into emotion machines.
While this technique may have worked in their previous nonfiction collaboration, "Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace," the story this time isn't about on-line skulduggery; at its heart, "Speeding the Net" is about boardroom meetings, stock options and the fundamentally boring process of typing computer code.
As a result, the excitement often has a tacked-on, hyperbolic ring. The Microsoft Corporation's relatively easy ride to Web dominance is called "one of the great corporate battles of the century." The Internet itself -- a forum actually frequented by only a minority of Americans (and even smaller populations elsewhere) -- is billed as "a ubiquitous cultural and economic phenomenon."
When Netscape itself finally appears, the authors hit their stride. Conflict, in the form of Bill Gates, triggers a chain of events that merits the novelistic prose. Over the course of four desperate years, Netscape scrambles to resist Microsoft's onslaught. James L. Barksdale, Netscape's C.E.O., sics the Justice Department's antitrust investigators on Microsoft. The Netscape board gives away stock to its employees as a motivator to improve flagging sales. Finally, hoping to diversify itself out of a Web-browser showdown with Microsoft, Netscape spends millions to acquire other software companies.
The authors clearly sympathize with the panicked crew at Netscape, yet they ignore the possibility that the company may have brought about some of its own problems. In tacking its acquired software onto Navigator, for example, Netscape bloated its crown jewel and may have spread the company too thin. Nor do the authors consider that Netscape lost the war because Microsoft simply created a better product: Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer, was stable, fast and free, whereas Netscape's $49 Navigator program was buggy.
THE book ends with Netscape's March 1998 last-ditch ploy, in which the company released the source code for Navigator to the public. The slim hope is that independent programmers will refine the software, extending its life in the marketplace despite Microsoft's dominance.
Aside from painting Microsoft as the villain, the authors offer no analysis; "Speeding the Net" is an exercise in pure reporting. At their best, they deftly demystify both the technology and the forces -- legal, economic and personal -- that drive the software business. But by the time the tale is over, the reader is left feeling like Netscape's college-kid programmers: depressed that Microsoft has seemingly squashed yet another innovator, and not quite sure what went wrong.

THE PROCESS
 1,100 Days That Changed
 the Middle East.
 By Uri Savir.
 Illustrated. 336 pp. New York:
 Random House. $27.95. 
 Uri Savir was a fast-rising career diplomat when he was tapped in May 1993 by Shimon Peres, a remarkable visionary who had held virtually every important post in Israel since its founding, to meet secretly with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Those clandestine meetings in Oslo evolved into a series of agreements on a phased exchange of land for peace, which are to culminate in a final settlement in May 1999. Only 40 at the time, though already Director General of the Israeli Foreign Service and a former consul general in New York City, Savir led Israel's negotiating team through the 1,100 arduous and agonizing days that produced the dramatic agreements -- the "process" of the book's title.
But there is more than one process here. First, of course, "The Process" is an insider's story of how bitter contenders for the same tiny patch of parched land struggled to disentangle their mutual hatreds, grievances and claims. The Oslo agreements were like no other in history, requiring detailed negotiations on everything from Yasir Arafat's title to the positioning of an Israeli security agent at the Allenby Bridge border crossing between the West Bank and Jordan. Given the uncertain future of the Oslo agreements today, politicians, reporters and historians are certain to sift through Savir's detailed account to buttress their continuing arguments. The revelation that Yitzhak Rabin envisioned giving the Palestinians up to 50 percent of the West Bank in three further stages while a final settlement was being negotiated has already made headlines in Israel as counterpoint to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence that an inch over 39 percent would pose a grave security threat to Israel. Savir also confirms that Rabin was prepared to cede the Golan Heights in a deal with Syria.
Some passages in the book seem specifically intended to counter the charges with which Netanyahu successfully attacked Peres in the 1996 campaign. Thus, to the devastating accusation that Peres had "subcontracted" Israeli security to the Palestinians, Savir describes how he firmly declared to the Palestinians: "We will not yield on security for Israelis. We will not make you responsible for it."
Such poking about in the compost heap of recent events would already give "The Process" a respectable place in the huge history of Middle East politics. But there is another process here, a far deeper and far more human one. This is the process by which the Israelis and Palestinians involved in the intense negotiations -- Rabin, Peres and Arafat included -- gradually rose above their deep resentments and hatreds, above the profound habits of suspicion and mutual demonization, to achieve if not always friendship, then at least a recognition of a partnership in a common predicament. The central story of this process is the development of a deep friendship between Savir and Ahmed Qurei, better known as Abu Ala, the chief Palestinian negotiator, and their families. There is also the mutual respect that gradually develops between Rabin and Arafat, and the many other amazing interactions between people only recently sworn to the other's destruction.
The development of that partnership and that wisdom is the real and lasting story of the Oslo talks. The primary focus of this account is the enormousness of the internal transformation required of one Israeli, Uri Savir, and, by implication, of Israelis in general, whose entire history militates against accepting that the Jews may be not only victims but also victimizers, not only David but also Goliath. It is this process that makes Savir's book critical for those -- in Israel and abroad -- who sincerely want to appreciate the real requirements for peace and the real obstacles to it. This is especially important now that Netanyahu and his Government have reverted to treating the Palestinians solely as a conquered nation, negotiating only among themselves on what they are prepared or not prepared to cede, and showing no apparent recognition of the yearnings, sufferings or differences of the Palestinians.
The son of a diplomat, Savir writes that he entered the process already imbued with his father's conviction that "talking to the enemy and influencing his attitudes . . . would not only cure this enmity but help us heal ourselves." Yet it is a long road from the inherited wisdom to Savir's appreciation of the full import of its truth. In the beginning, Savir follows Rabin's lead in couching Israel's motives solely in terms of its own interests: "Israel is a great success story, but the occupation is corrupting our youth."
As the process unfolds, the Israeli negotiators increasingly come to appreciate that their occupation was also corrupting the Palestinians through humiliation and economic degradation. Gradually the Palestinians come into focus as people, as humans, and not as the impersonal "Arab."
A turning point arrives with a fierce outburst by Peres, a man who appears throughout the book several legions ahead of his fellow Israelis in his vision of what can be. During an internal discussion of a deal on Hebron, Israeli military officers express their concern at how the militant Jewish settlers will react. " 'I'm fed up with your fear of what the settlers will say. What gall!' he bellowed. 'You want 150,000 Hebronites to remain under our control because of 400 Jews? . . . I'm telling you that we can break Arafat, if that's what you want. But then we'll be left with Hamas, an intifada and terror.' " The blast took political courage, because it was certain to be leaked to the press -- and was. But what Peres had come to understand was that the success of the negotiations required sensitivity not only to Israeli politics but to Palestinian politics as well.
Soon after, Savir describes his own coming of age in a remarkable passage: "These negotiations, over the powers Israel had exercised for a whole generation, opened an entire world before me. Over the years Israelis had cultivated a self-serving myth that ours was an 'enlightened occupation.' I knew this was a contradiction in terms, but I did not know -- and I think few other Israelis did -- how thoroughly we had invaded the lives of our Palestinian neighbors. We repressed this knowledge as we may have been the first conquerors in history that felt themselves conquered. . . . During 28 years of occupation, about a third of the Palestinian population in the territories had, at one time or another, been detained or imprisoned by Israel. And the whole of the population had, at some time, been grossly humiliated by us."
Despite the confessional tone of this passage, and some bitter sallies at Netanyahu and his right-wing allies, Savir is not a polemicist for a political cause. For all his profound and sometimes emotional involvement, he is never blind to the limitations and failings of the Palestinians, and he is relentless in his denunciation of Arafat for failing to curb terrorism. Savir is a professional diplomat, striving on every page to be fair and factual, and keenly aware of the failings of the peace process, not least the failure of the Labor Government to spread the real message of the Oslo accords among the Israelis. The fact that he wrote this book in English, his second language, seems only to give the account a greater directness.
Savir is not among those who console themselves with assurances that "Oslo is irreversible." Describing the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin by Yigal Amir, a religious nationalist, he muses: "As I write, it is still too soon to tell whether Amir succeeded in killing the peace as well. Those who sang 'The Song of Peace' sit on the opposition benches today, while some of those who chanted 'Rabin is a traitor' are in power." Yet Savir and his new friend, Abu Ala, emerge convinced that the larger understanding they initiated cannot be destroyed. "Shaking hands and building a partnership," he says, "meant not only the renunciation of past hostility but a break with traditions deeply ingrained in each of our societies." On the Israeli side, Savir cites Peres's definition of the Oslo agreements as nothing less than the second stage of the Zionist revolution, "an effort to remove the ghetto from the Jewish ethos decades after it had disappeared from Jewish history."
Those who perceive the Oslo accords as a betrayal of the Jewish people are not likely to give Savir a sympathetic ear, while others are likely to brandish his story as proof of an opportunity missed. But if his father was right, the key to resolving Israel's internal dispute is in looking past the myths and grievances, and seeing the other for what he is.

 Naked
 By David Sedaris. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95.
This funny, venomous and at times sad collection of 17 autobiographical essays focuses on the author's many bizarre experiences, like a week at a nudist trailer park, as well as on his family, particularly his witty, acerbic mother. "Even the bleakest of them contain stuff you shouldn't read with your mouth full," Craig Seligman wrote here in 1997.
 
 The God of Small Things
 By Arundhati Roy. Harper Perennial, $13.
A 31-year-old woman returns to her formerly elegant home in southern India to be reunited with her haunted twin brother, whom she hasn't seen since a calamitous event drove them apart and blighted their lives almost 25 years earlier. Part political fable, part psychological drama, part fairy tale, this first novel is a devastating meditation on the decline and fall of an Indian family. The quality of Roy's narration "is so extraordinary -- at once so morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple -- that the reader remains enthralled all the way through to its agonizing finish," Alice Truax said in the Book Review last year.
 
 The Trouble With Prosperity
 A Contrarian's Tale of Boom, Bust, and Speculation
 By James Grant. Times Business/Random House, $15.
A chronic bear warns that Americans are far too smitten with the stock market, and with an eye toward past economic cycles, he argues that what goes up must come down. The result is "a witty and informative" book, John Rothchild wrote here in 1996. In The Big Ten: The Big Emerging Markets and How They Will Change Our Lives (Basic Books, $14), Jeffrey E. Garten, a former top trade policy adviser to President Clinton, argues that 10 countries -- ranging from India to Turkey -- are rapidly becoming major forces in the world economy. Last year, our reviewer, Alan Tonelson, said that even if the power of these nations is exaggerated, the book "is a welcome . . . corrective" to the Administration's Pollyanna-ish views. The moguls behind today's global communications empires are the focus of The Highwaymen: Warriors of the Information Superhighway, by Ken Auletta (Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13). The author of this collection of 17 profiles, which has been updated and features a new chapter on Microsoft, "is a superb reporter and seems happiest explicating the nuts and bolts of a company," Judith Newman said here in 1997.
 
 Life Without Water
 By Nancy Peacock. Bantam, $10.95.
A young girl named Cedar, growing up on a primitive commune in North Carolina, describes how she and her mother survived the false utopias of the 60's, and in the process digs deep beneath the peace and love platitudes of the time. In 1996, our reviewer, Francine Prose, called this a "deft, sly, unassuming first novel."
 
 Alvin Ailey: A Life in Dance
 By Jennifer Dunning. Da Capo, $16.95.
This unflinching portrait of the brilliant but deeply tormented choreographer is also a study of black dance in America during much of the century and a social history of the turbulent theatrical world of the 1960's, 70's and 80's. The author, a dance critic for The New York Times, has written a "compassionate and painstakingly reported biography," Mindy Aloff wrote here in 1996. The same publisher has issued another profile of a legendary dancer and choreographer, All His Jazz: The Life & Death of Bob Fosse, by Martin Gottfried ($16.95). The outsize figure that emerges here was furiously driven and immensely gifted in both dance and filmmaking but was also tormented by depression and self-loathing. "The cardinal virtue" of this account is the author's "intimacy with the show-business scene that was Fosse's chrysalis," Ronald Bryden said in the Book Review in 1990.
 
 The Bounty
 By Derek Walcott.
 Noonday/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $12.
This volume of poetry ranges from an elegy on the poet's mother to fresh visits to such old haunts as New England, Europe and his home island, St. Lucia. While generally unimpressed with the author's longer works, William Logan said here last year that "Walcott is a master of . . . easy, careless abundance" and admired "the stunned eloquence of his lines." The same publisher has issued another retrospective volume by a major poet, History of My Heart, by Robert Pinsky ($12), which includes portraits of the author's family and boyhood neighbors, among others. "Pinsky has a rare gift . . . for action, character and atmosphere clearly and buoyantly proportioned," R. W. Flint wrote in these pages in 1984.
 
 The Club Dumas
 By Arturo Perez-Reverte. Translated by Sonia Soto.
 Vintage International, $13.
Lucas Corso, a cynical Spanish mercenary specializing in hunting down rare books, gets into trouble when he agrees to authenticate both a missing chapter of "The Three Musketeers" and a 17th-century manual for summoning the Devil. The result is an "intelligent and delightful novel," Margot Livesey said here last year.
 
 Don't Erase Me: Stories
 By Carolyn Ferrell. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.
The eight tales in this debut collection focus on urban young people, describing, for example, the survival techniques of a gay black teen-ager and a woman's path to becoming H.I.V. positive. "It's intimate in the way you used to hope a good book could be," our reviewer, Katharine Whitemore, wrote in 1997. Scott Veale

HEADLINE: Ashamed Of The Boom;
Let's Go on A Guilt Trip

BYLINE: By Denise Dowling; Denise Dowling is a writer based in San Fransisco.

 BODY:
It's spring break, and Karen Bashour, 17, is visiting Tijuana, Mexico, with 14 other students from her high school in Northern California. It's not exactly a vacation, though: at the moment the students are inhaling sewage-runoff fumes from an industrial plant, one of nearly 700 maquiladoras (foreign-owned companies) based in the city. They're also getting a lecture about dismal working conditions from Cesar Luna, an environmental lawyer from San Diego.
The United States' economy is booming, but we're not thinking about the other side, he says. Countries come here, exploit workers and leave a legacy of pollution. Now, what do you plan to do with this information? The students study their shoelaces. We're feeling guilty because we live in luxury, says Andrea Stark, another student. Stark and her friends are all from the Sacred Heart Preparatory School in Atherton, bordering Silicon Valley, a $13,000-a-year private academy catering to kids of the high-tech elite. They're in Tijuana on a reality tour created by Global Exchange, a San Francisco nonprofit group that takes kids and adults on trips like this to inject social responsibility. 
 It may sound like a parody of hurry-up self-improvement, but there's also a likable idealism to the concept, which was hatched by Medea Benjamin, a former nutritionist for the United Nations who co-founded Global Exchange in 1989. The students deserve credit just for showing up. They could be skiing somewhere; they chose to do this.
Called What Do You Mean, Free Trade? the tour is a fast look at the residual miseries of roaring international capitalism. Kicking off on Easter Sunday, the students start at toxic-waste sites in Silicon Valley, explore East L.A. and then head south.
On their first day in Tijuana, they tour a factory run by Smith Corona, a place that reeks of the sulfuric smell of hot plastic. Inside, a teen-age worker wearing a Just Do It T-shirt gives the group a sullen glare. I feel stupid staring like they're in a zoo, whispers Stark. But I don't think the workers resent us. I hope they know we're here to help.
That night's assignment involves trying to interview migrants who plan to sneak into San Diego through the border fence, 14 miles of corrugated steel painted with the words Todo en frente y nada detras (Everything in front and nothing behind). A Mexican official shoos the students away, and the vans haul everyone back to the hotel for reflection.
It struck me how much we have and don't appreciate, says Hannah Scherzer. Like, before, I really wanted my sister's room. I worried that my room is too small.
This 'guilt trip' concerns me, Luna frowns. Once you become proactive, emotions like guilt start to fade. What's our obligation as consumers? That's the big question, of course: what to do. At Niketown in San Francisco the next day, Gardner Loulan, a sophomore, sounds flummoxed. There's so much I want to do, he sighs, but kids don't really have any power. Later, back home, he will briefly feel like "an idiot for eating at McDonald's. Then I thought: This is your life, Gardner. It's not your fault you live in an upper-middle-class family in a first-world country.
For her part, Julia Riechert leaves the trip thinking big. I've always said that when I make millions, I'll go to Mexico and make it better, she says. Now I think, why wait?

All Money, All the Time

BYLINE: By Michael Lewis; Michael Lewis is a contributing writer for the magazine. Ken Kurson, who compiled the statistics throughout this issue, is the author of "The Green Magazine Guide to Personal Finance."

 BODY:
A few years into the current boom, I was invited by a money manager to spend a night in the Connecticut countryside. As I had passed most of that day with him in a Park Avenue office, it did not strike me as especially forward of him to invite me home. But by midnight his wife had gone to bed and it was just the two of us, alone in his living room, with the clackety-clack of the crickets and the squeakety-squeak of a corkscrew opening a bottle of wine. We had arrived at a moment of genuine financial intimacy. Money had become personal. The money manager handed me a full wineglass and said, "I'm going to tell you about some stocks you need to buy." In the next two hours this man described in detail four small companies that could change my life. He had researched them fully. Each one sounded better than the last. I tried to look relaxed about the whole thing, but I did not feel relaxed. As the deals became sweeter and sweeter, I twisted with desire in my chair. At 2 in the morning, having transformed me into a greedy pretzel, the man lowered his voice. "Mike," he said, "this fifth company, it's special." Pause. "This is for you and your family." Pause. "Buy it, put it away and let it make you rich." Pause.
"Molten Metal Technology." He then went on to describe in great financial detail what it was that Molten Metal Technology did, as if that mattered. Meanwhile, I was trying to determine exactly how much of my retirement account I could sink into it. The next morning I called my broker and bought the stock at $19 a share. In the next few weeks Molten Metal Technology leapt from $19 to $29, then from $29 to $36, then from $36 to $41. Then it collapsed. To $2. A few months later the company declared bankruptcy. 
 There was a time not long ago when my financial reaction to that evening would have been of no formal interest to people who study money and human behavior. Academic economists have long assumed that insane financial acts cancel one another out: for every fool who drives up the price of Molten Metal Technology on a cold tip, there is another to drive it back down. And, in any case, observers of high finance have tended to confine their interest to the rich.
But in the past decade or so a couple of trends have rendered the financial madness of jes' plain folk not merely interesting but science. A new subspecies of economics has sprung up, calling itself behavioral finance. Its theorists argue that humanity's strange attitudes toward money find their way into markets, generally. Most economists take grim pleasure in proving markets boringly efficient; these new theorists delight in the bizarre things people get up to with their money. They point out, for instance, that the stock with the ticker symbol MCI, which belongs to a closed-end investment company, moves whenever new information appears about M.C.I., the phone company. (Some shrewd investors capitalize on this phenomenon, buying the fund when the phone company announces good news.) They point out, also, that people overvalue information they receive privately and undervalue information they receive publicly. That is, had I read about Molten Metal Technology the next morning in The Wall Street Journal, I wouldn't have thought twice about it.
The other trend that has dignified the financial emotions of the average citizen might be called trickle-down finance. Credit cards, closed-end mutual funds, open-end mutual funds, I.R.A.'s, employee stock plans, adjustable-rate mortgages -- it is no longer just the very rich who make complicated financial decisions. It's Claude and Maude. About the time they opened their Merrill Lynch cash-management account, and learned all the funny tricks their $43,582.49 should perform, they developed a series of neurotic twitches previously confined to the rich.
Broadly, there are two attitudes toward money: the winner's and the loser's. At the moment, the winner's mentality is on the rise. "If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?" is a phrase that has long been on the tip of the American tongue. In the current boom it has acquired a cousin: "I'm so smart, it is inevitable that I become rich." In the sea of social class, money remains our Great Barrier Reef. It distinguishes people from one another, more than religion, even more than race. People tend to spend time, and everything else, in the company of others who possess roughly similar sums of money. But we Americans do not fully acknowledge this. We exhibit a surprising tendency not merely to envy but also to identify with our economic superiors. The winner gazes across the room at Molten Metal Man, who has many millions more than he ever will, and thinks, I can be rich, too! That swelling sense of well-being you feel in the presence of the guy higher up the money tree contains a delicious, unspoken perception -- you can be he!
The winner is driven by his greed, of course, but also by his fears. He fears, first, not having enough money. His is not the justifiable anxiety of the poor, or of the sinking middle class. It is the tightfisted neurosis of a more or less prosperous human being. Like the very fat person who is obsessed with starving, the winner has lost his ability to distinguish psychological from material need. Oddly enough, the winner also fears perfect satisfaction. He worries that without the desire to make more money he will lose his purpose, like a racing dog that has finally caught up to the mechanical rabbit. His whole life is scheduled on the assumption that he does what he does every day to get even more money. And then -- surprise! -- it turns out that money was just an excuse to avoid thinking very much about the life he was living. Money gives winners a reason to go to work in the morning, even when they shouldn't.
The loser suffers from the opposite neurosis: he uses the world around him to reinforce his conviction that he is destined for financial failure. Even in the current boom there are still people alive who believe that money avoids them as surely as the pole of one magnet avoids another. When the loser encounters someone who obviously has more money than he does, he does not think, Here's my role model. He thinks, I'm not at all like him. He may do this justifiably, because he belongs to that great swatch of lower- and lower-middle-class America that has been untouched by the boom. Or he may do this because his imagination prevents him from doing anything else.
Winner and loser are not synonymous with rich and poor. There are poor winners and rich losers. As a dinner companion, one is not necessarily preferable to the other, although one is more likely to pick up the tab. The loser can be charmingly self-deprecating. Or he can exude bitter hostility toward the whole enterprise of free-market life. In either case he usually exhibits at least a trace of masochism: at some level he enjoys being tortured by money.
Necessarily, I oversimplify. The mentalities of winner and loser often jostle for supremacy in the same mind. Two years ago, for instance, when I bought Molten Metal Technology, I found myself thrown back and forth by the horns of opposing sentiments. When the stock began to rise, my first emotion was relief that it did not fall. Soon followed self-celebration: what a genius I was to have coaxed such advice from the money manager. But immediately after glee rushed guilt: what exactly had I done to deserve this good fortune? Nothing.
In the end came terror, waving its summons. The more money I made, the more reason I had to be punished. My retirement years were no longer my own; they belonged to Molten Metal Technology. Three months after being driven to this singular act of money madness, I began to fear for myself, and my family. And moments before Molten Metal Technology came a cropper, with the stock at $40 a share, I sold it.
The tale thus ended on an enriching note, though at no point was I motivated by anything that could be said to be good or pure. At no point did I have an intelligent thought about Molten Metal Technology. I never did figure out which metals the company molted, or why. It was merely the sum of a rattlebag of impulses and neuroses that spurred me on. Those impulses and neuroses happened to have led me to make a lot of money. That's what makes it a story for our time.

GRAPHIC: Photos: No sooner does Joe America learn what tricks the $40,000 in his Merrill Lynch cash-management account can do than he develops the neurotic twitches once confined to the rich (p. 62); Some basic facts of the bull run: The volume of trading on the New York Stock Exchange has quadrupled since 1990. From 1982 to 1997, the S&P 500 gained 1,026% (with dividends reinvested). Last year, $609 billion was invested in equity mutual funds, almost 9 times the amount in 1987 and about 30 times the amount in 1984; that $609 billion represented more money than the mutual funds' total assets just five years earlier. In 1981, American I.R.A.'s held a total of $26 billion; in 1996, $1.3 trillion. And how does the average American feel about the boom? In a recent survey, 78% of the respondents said that they believe "the rich get richer and the poor get poorer," and 43% said that they feel "left out of things going on around them."

HEADLINE: Shrugging At The Boom;
Where's The Outrage?

BYLINE: By Michael Kazin; Michael Kazin as a professor of history at American University. He is the author of "The Populist Persuasion."

 BODY:
Back in the gilded age, wall street was a synonym for economic turpitude. Cartoonists for the Hearst and Pulitzer chains dipped their pens in acid before depicting a stock tycoon; the bloated plutocrat in a tight suit checkered with dollar signs, diamond stickpin gleaming from his cravat, became a turn-of-the-century cliche.
In those days, a politician could rise to prominence by bashing the money power -- shorthand for an evil amalgam of financial speculators and investment bankers. We are not opposed to that wealth which comes as the reward of honest toil, explained William Jennings Bryan during his 1900 campaign for President. "We draw the line between honest wealth and predatory wealth." 
 Well, sometimes the past really is past. Whatever happened to outrage against the investing class? It's not as if the old complaints have been resolved. Today's bull market has made wealthy Americans filthy rich -- while average wages have barely crept upward. While more Americans than ever now own stock, a full 60 percent of us have none whatsoever. The United States still has the most unequal distribution of wealth of any major industrial nation.
Yet hardly anybody is riled up about all this. Why not?
In order to understand the relative absence of protest now, it is necessary to look back at the heyday of discontent toward the money power. In Bryan's day, most Americans made their living with their hands. Women and men typically learned a skill in their youth -- and stuck with it for life. Millions of wage earners and small-business people, on farms and in the cities, viewed themselves proudly as "producers." This was, at base, a moral identity: only those who created wealth in tangible ways could be trusted. The Bible seemed to agree. Hadn't the Lord commanded Adam, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread? What made J. P. Morgan think he could behave differently?"
This producer ethic helped inspire a variety of mass movements, all of which bore a grudge against men who prospered merely by fiddling with numbers on paper. In the 1880's, the Knights of Labor signed up more than a million wage earners and small-trades people -- but categorically excluded speculators and bankers as being no more than gamblers. The People's Party and labor groups beckoned the toiling masses to fight back against plutocrats. And fight back they did: in 1919, more than four million people -- one-fifth of the total work force -- went on strike.
But by the 1930's, Americans were becoming less sure that battling "the money power" would enhance their well-being. A society of independent-minded producers was giving way to a nation of employees who worked to consume. The typical worker no longer cared so much how the rich became richer -- as long as he had the money and time to enjoy the vaunted American standard of living.
Assaults on the "money-changers" of Wall Street began to sound increasingly anachronistic. On occasion, a populist tried to stir up working Americans. In 1962, Rep. Wright Patman of Texas railed, "Our country belongs to the people. . .not to the huge financial houses and commercial banks." But fewer Americans than ever shared his anger.
The shifting nature of American jobs had something to do with it. Service and clerical work came to overshadow labor in factories, on farms and in mines. And data-entry clerks and janitors tended to be cut off from the cultures of manual labor that once had generated waves of producer protest.
The result was a labor pool full of people who floated from counter to cubicle, at firms where unions seldom penetrated. The nature of the jobs -- burger-flipping, keyboarding -- do not inspire a sense that one's work is the wellspring of a decent society and an authentic democracy.
Meanwhile, the old fear of Wall Street has been replaced by familiarity. The NASDAQ index is reported as often as the weather -- and with the same air of inevitability. In suburban malls, storefront investment outlets have sprung up next to pet shops. What was mysterious has become banal.
More important, the rich whose names we recognize are quite different from the WASP titans of the industrial age. They're a diverse, and rather likable, group. Instead of robber barons, today's rich are entertainment impresarios like Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey, computer wizards like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and financial prophets like Warren Buffett. Public relations is in their blood, and it's rare that one of the new rich (like Philip Knight of Nike) is branded an exploiter of labor.
It helps that Americans have long been ambivalent about the rich. We alternately envy and satirize the wealthy but feel they differ from the rest of us only in having more ingenuity or good luck. Even during the Gilded Age, workers didn't resent the rich merely for having money. To elicit mass hostility, the Carnegies and the Morgans had to flaunt their power and privilege -- by smashing a strike with a private army or giving an obscenely lavish party at Delmonico's. Otherwise, many Americans believed they were just a big break or two away from joining the top ranks themselves. That's still true today.
Not every American buys into the Horatio Alger myth. Yet it's hard to hear dissent amid the clamor of rising market averages. The collapse of Communism remains a powerful argument against any vision of what bygone radicals called a "cooperative commonwealth." And the top economists now argue that every human action tries to maximize individual self-interest -- and ridicule dissenters as whining Luddites.
The critics deserve better. Today's investment culture has invaded our imaginations and distorted our values. In a society where the Dow Jones average is king, it's not surprising that cleverness trumps diligence, and the glitter of instant wealth outshines achievements grounded in the manufacture of useful goods and the delivery of vital services.
A century ago, many prosperous Americans at least felt a twinge of guilt about the gap between their swelling bank accounts and the single-digit daily wages paid to manual workers. Today, that twinge is gone. Few rich Americans seem troubled that their pile rests on the hard, anonymous labor of thousands of people, here and abroad, who often lack access to good health care and education for their children.
At times like this, one needs to voice an old-fashioned protest: there is something immoral about striking it rich by playing the Wall Street wheel of fortune while people with little or no savings clean your clothes, harvest your food, fix your car and care for your children. We have forgotten a maxim our ancestors took for granted: the separation of labor and wealth is the seedbed of corruption.
William Jennings Bryan would never have been mistaken for a social philosopher. Yet he did have a fitting response to those, in his time and ours, who worship the raging bull of speculation. Money is to be servant of man, he once said, and I protest against all theories that enthrone money and debase mankind.

HEADLINE: Missing The Boom;
Some of My Best Friends Are Rich

BYLINE: By Matthew Klam; Matthew Klam lives in Washington. His fiction has appeared in The New Yorker.

 BODY:
These are boom times -- for my friends. Like me, they work hard, and boy, is it paying off. They're getting rich. Their lives are becoming more and more perfect. They're shopping, eating and sleeping in places where I can't go. They've vanished behind a curtain and sailed over the rainbow -- and life is easier in that other world, because the future is secured. Bad things can't touch them.
Or maybe it just seems that way to me because I don't get together with them as much anymore, because they are gone most of July and August, or have moved to an incredible $4,000-a-month loft I've never visited, or to the suburbs -- to the exact house I would have built, down to the kitchen with polished stainless-steel appliances. While many of my friends negotiate financial packages of staggering amounts, pondering one offer over another while planning their next vacation to Bali -- or while hitting $7 golf balls into the ocean off their front lawn in East Hampton -- I'm praying my checks won't bounce. 
 You see, short stories are my bread and butter -- and the market for my commodity is flat. There was the year I made $21,000 selling stories and a proposal for a book I have yet to finish. Then there was the year after that when I made peanuts teaching grad students.
I close my eyes and see my cousin Jonny, pulling up last Thanksgiving in his white Range Rover, and later unrolling the blueprints for his gigantic new house across the dinner table. Or my buddy Lloyd, who, 10 years ago, had a play produced in a small theater in Manhattan but now works on Wall Street. His wife has an emerald-cut diamond the size of a Chiclet on her ring finger, and I can still picture him eyeing the engagement ring on my fiancee's finger. Lara's diamond is more like a Tic-Tac than a Chiclet; I was ashamed of its size in comparison.
I gave a reading a while ago in a library basement, and my friend Peter showed up. (These moments are often ego boosts for me; they help balance out my feelings of inadequacy.) Like Lloyd, Peter abandoned writing a few years back. It was good to see him and we got to chat, since the audience was slow to arrive. He'll finish law school this summer, and then he's moving to Los Angeles for a job in entertainment law. I was happy for him -- and even though between the two of us, I'm the successful writer, achiever of dreams (while he quit!) -- he stood there grinning. He was grinning because he's glad he isn't me, waiting to see if enough people show, in a room that smells like mold.
Right then I wanted Peter's life so badly I felt like crying; I didn't want to wait to see if anyone else came to my reading; I wanted him to take me along to his law firm in Los Angeles. I wanted a suit like his, and I wanted to wear it driving a convertible in the California sunshine while those bad memories of never having any money faded away.
Why do these little moments stick with me? There's my friend Bill, who spent $400 at the supermarket last Sunday night because he was hungry; Chris, who flew himself to France to ride in a bicycle race (counting the equipment, the support vehicle and transportation -- and the cigars he brought back -- he spent 12 grand in six days); Karen, who bought a $3,000 Italian mahogany table because she likes to have dinner parties; Bill's wife, Samantha, who yesterday spent $1,200 on some -- very nice -- plants; Abby, who moments after her fiance Scott's most recent pay raise bought him $250 worth of underwear in fantastic colors; Elliott, who just got back from kayaking in Cabo (wherever that is); Nick and Linda, who went to Crate and Barrel and furnished their new apartment in three hours flat.
There are more reports like this than there used to be. In fact, the reports keep coming in. They're in! I'm out. These silly anecdotes have become like ghosts that follow me wherever I go, reminding me of what I am: a financial joke. I don't fit in. I don't make enough. You know how it is when you get together with old friends, and not a second is lost, everything is still the same? Well, it's not still the same. I don't feel like one of the guys anymore. What's a stock split? What's a data point? What's a Top Driver? Why is it revolutionizing the industry? I'm like a stranger in my own native land. I imagine this is how the Amish feel.
They aren't plain old middle-class pals anymore. These are actual rich people. My college chum Russ sets up initial public offerings and runs money into funds and everything is ramping nicely and he's bummed because his hedge-fund buddy recently bought a Lear jet. And I'm schlepping around, he says, in business class. He's 34. He's about to buy a yacht. Some days, to ease the undercurrent of tension when we talk, he pretends to envy me. You write because you have no choice, Klam, he says. It's your calling, so stop complaining. Your whole day could be spent in a bathrobe.
I graduated from college in 1986. The heartwarming film "Wall Street" came out around that time, and many of my friends went directly into banking. I'd majored in philosophy, and had absolutely no ideas, no goals, no plan for life. I felt inspired and wrote poetry -- and then, in romantic fashion, I drove around the country for years, writing lousy stuff and making no money until, eventually, I found the tiniest nibble of success.
As awful as it sounds, I liked this life, wandering from place to place with a bank balance that hovered around $60. But things are a lot different now from when I dreamed this profession up at 22. I wasn't raised to be poor, or to be patient and have faith. Now I'm 33 and I go through terrible bouts of hating myself, when I wake up with regrets, 11 long years into Not-Being-Legitimate. The shame stays with me all day.
But, wait, you say, he's an artist. Where has the pride gone? Well, the heady times when I've felt like Jack Kerouac -- when having my name in a national magazine meant more than anything -- ended in a hurry. The look on people's faces when I tell them what I've been up to, the envy they felt for my freedom, that's over. They envy nothing now. They worry instead. Or they don't want to hear about my sorry money woes. It makes them. . .uncomfortable. They don't notice, when we go out to a restaurant, that I worry about who orders what, and why should they? It's not their problem.
I'm sitting across from the host of a dinner party in Georgetown; he's wearing a great suit with a gleaming crisp shirt, French cuffs, a bright tie; he looks athletic and well rested. He's very happy to meet a real writer, he says. He used to be a writer himself. He wrote stories all through college and still reads everything being published. He runs his father's investment firm now, but the more we talk, the more he's thinking of retyping a story he wrote in college and showing it to me. He wants to know what it's like to write all day and where the ideas come from.
I've had two giant glasses of gin and I'm tired and I don't like him but maybe that's because he seems to be employing a fake British accent. "The bloody thing about fiction writing," he says, "is that it has to be true, but you have to make it up." There isn't one stick of furniture in the entire three-story brick town house that I could afford except the salad bowl, but who cares? We're talking about what I do, and I'm the star of the moment. "Have you ever met Norman Mailer?" he asks. Bingo! I met him just the week before and I say so. My host's envy is pouring into me, and his eyes are boring holes in my eyes. He envies my life, my privileges, the secret places I've been able to get to, the stuff I've got. For the first time in a long time, I feel jealousy. It feels great.
This is how i get by: when the phone bill with the threatening red stripe arrives, then I pay it. When the credit card maxes out, I retire it. I don't ever talk about money with the friends who are loaded. If, as I suspect, my old buddy Spleef is worth $20 million, I don't want to know. I hope he doesn't tell me. Why would he want to depress me like that?
I've been engaged now for four months, to a professional woman with a growing psychotherapy practice and financial expectations -- and if I had any secrets before, well, the vault that holds the deepest wells of humiliation has been violated. We haven't pooled our money yet but we're getting ready to, and around our kitchen table I've had to answer for my absurd economic realities, all those money issues I kept privately to myself (so successfully from myself) all these years:
Lara asks, "How much do you need per month to live on?"
"I don't know."
"What are you going to do this summer?"
"Leave it up to whimsy."
"What if that doesn't work out?"
"In that unlikely event, I'll be broke."
"But," she says, "two days ago you said you were rich."
"I know. I was. I've spent that."
I mention other moneymaking ideas, like a TV pilot I've discussed with a friend who works for UPN. She likes it. "I don't care about your money," she says. "You need it for yourself."
"Why do we have to talk about this now?" I say.
"It's good practice," she says.
I hate it. I want to have money -- I want to be able to offer us all kinds of options, I want her to be able to quit working if she feels like it and go buy houseplants. I want to surprise her with a thick reddish cashmere coat with a hood, like one she saw in a magazine; it would look really good with her wrapped inside it. I want to pick up the phone and call on some real-estate agent so that we can go house hunting in his Lexus -- he'll offer us coffee from a little thermos while we drive around -- but I can't, because I don't have the dough.
"Eventually," I say. "I'll make more."
"It's O.K.," she says.
"Right now we don't need money," I say.
"We could live on sunlight," she says. "Like plants. How are we going to have children if you can't talk about money?"
"Children?" I say.
She mentions a funny movie we saw the other night, about these clever roommates who plot to murder one another for some money they stole, and adds: You could've written that. Why can't you write something like that?
I know she's just trying to help, and she's right. In the last few months I've done ghostwriting, advertising, business writing -- it all pays better than fiction, but on the tip of my tongue is a suggestion that we take her 12,000 pairs of shoes and start a museum and charge admission. I want to have this talk about the future without the money component, no money fights ever, me handling everything and taking care of business, and we'd just be two lovers living on sunlight, plenty of green.
It's not a crime that she has a lot of shoes, or makes a decent living. She's not the only one. Many of my friends who weren't even interested in money have reached a point now of making a pretty good wage. I know a dentist who's 33 and has just built a $750,000 house on a lake. He bought a speedboat, and the boat has such a big motor it goes across the lake in five seconds, and then he has to turn back.
But to have his life, I'd have to be a dentist. I wouldn't want to be a dentist.
I don't want anybody else's life. And yet I think about quitting writing every 20 minutes. I'm sure my money problems are tied to my father's. He struggled with it his whole life. Not that he was poor -- he actually made money -- but he was all messed up by it. He managed a team that sold invisible financial products, like estate planning, pensions, insurance for corporations. It didn't mean anything to him. He got more satisfaction from shining his shoes at night than from running an insurance agency. What he really enjoyed was being outdoors -- in the garden, on a horse, in the woods -- or walking around the pool, every summer weekend, in nothing but a terry cloth hat. Business wasn't the right environment for my dad. He didn't have the heart of a money guy. And so he begged me, without saying so, to do something else -- to make something, though I'm sure he didn't think I'd be doing it for almost nothing.
I grew up in a really nice 250-year-old house in Katonah, N.Y., with a pool, a tennis court and two horses. My parents would have cocktail parties; groups of men with a pool, a tennis court and two horses in their yards would stand next to one another, uptight and cranky, acting like peevish kids, complaining because they had no friends. Living in Westchester County, we were surrounded by stories of families falling to pieces -- and money was always part of the crackup. I remember the Mercedes-Benz our neighbor bought his wife, as a last-ditch peacemaker, and then quit payments on; and the horse she said she had to have -- her final demand -- but only a $20,000 one would do.
Growing up in this strange environment, where it all looked like excess, money began to seem toxic. I'm not cut out for it -- the cashing in. The whole thing scares me.
I had a college roommate, Carl, who upon graduation took a job doing the exact same thing that caused my father all that misery: selling life insurance. We said goodbye and I shook my head, watching him head off in his new Nissan Sentra -- poor sellout! He was doomed, flying off like a projectile in the wrong direction. In his first week he made $3,800 in commissions on top of his regular salary, and in his second week he made $16,000 and immediately got a promotion. No more tuna subs for Carl. A year later he went on to sell computer memory modules for mainframes. He owns valuable company stock. He's one of the best salesmen in his company's history, and if he felt like it, he could retire tomorrow.
I remember once in college rallying him to pitch in for a letter-writing campaign for Amnesty International. Carl wasn't worried about torture victims in Siberia. He had to get through the sports section first. And anyway we were in rural New Hampshire. No torture victims there. That's Carl -- he's a great athlete, he'll do anything for a laugh, he's charming, he graduated with a near-perfect G.P.A., he's not stuck up. Work, like everything else, is a game to Carl. He usually wins, and has fun doing it. Being a success works fine for Carl, because he does what he wants. He made a choice and he's happy. I made a choice, too. I wanted to write, so I write.
There are, however, a couple of other things I want, to help alleviate my pain.
I want. I want Campagnolo Super Record components for my road bike. I want this suede-looking Armani silk suit with a tiny waffle weave. I want a big front lawn overlooking the ocean. I want a 1970 Oldsmobile Cutlass 442, dark green with a white rally stripe, convertible roof, black seats. I want a live-in cook and a new pair of cleats for baseball. I want a Psion Series 5 hand-held computer so that I can input data while I'm waiting on the checkout line at the Safeway. I want a Breitling Tag Heuer Bell and Ross organic titanium chronograph scuba diving watch. I want a big black stereo with one button on the front and a glowing red light. I want a plain-paper, all-in-one fax, color copier and printer. I want a hands-free wireless telephone headset. I want a one-gig Zip drive, a platinum wedding band and a ski house in Idaho. I want my fiancee to be able to walk into H. Stern Jewelers on Fifth Avenue and mill around for an hour, and I want to pay for it, and not have to worry too much about what she got. I want an electronic nosehair trimmer, something that literally rips the hairs out at the roots. I want to be able to buy for this 13-year-old who lives on my street some sterling silver widgets for the Irish flute he's learning to play. I want parabolic downhill skis. I haven't even gotten to the kitchen stuff. I want some Bernardaud porcelain plates in the Olivier Gagnere pastel patterns. And I want some ridiculous things that I'm embarrassed to mention.
I should be able to buy this stuff. I keep waiting to figure this out. It just seems to me, well, I'm as smart as my rich friends. I'm at least as smart as any of them. I'm the smartest person in the world!
I had all the opportunity. I still do. I could have done anything. I could have gone into law -- and right now I'd be working with Ally McBeal, flirting with her, wondering if our tactics were ethical, eating takeout, pouting our lips; she'd have on a skimpy skirt, I'd be in a big suit.. . .But I didn't. I shunned the jobs that make good money. It's my fault. I'm indefensible. Some guys want to make money, so they make money. In them, I already see these trends: too much drinking, outbursts of rage, profound aimlessness. I guess I like to watch. Mine is a good job -- witness to my generation. It's a damned dilemma that in this culture it's totally up to me whether I become a financial killer or a financial failure. To actually have this choice -- to be rich or poor -- this psychological mind-set, is a particularly modern ambivalence. But the fact that I'm moving down from where I started seems to me most unforgivable.
"You'll be so glad when you finish your book," my friend Jodi says. She's an elementary-school teacher. Her husband, Rich, runs some mysterious business that makes a lot of money. "Because writing is more like a hobby. Then you can go get a job."

HEADLINE: Opting Out Of The Boom;
Why More Blacks Don't Invest

BYLINE: By Glenn C. Loury; Glenn C. Loury is a professor of economics and director of the Institute on Race and Social Division at Boston University.

 BODY:
The greatest bull market to hit wall street since the 1920's has everybody talking about money these days. Such talk puts me in mind of my late and beloved uncle, patriarch of the extended household where I grew up in the 1950's and 1960's on Chicago's South Side. Uncle Moonie, whose large round eyes protruded like half-moons beneath his often-furrowed brow, spent most of his waking hours worrying about money: how to get it and, if truth be told, how to stop his wife from spending it. A tenacious businessman, he achieved what for his generation of blacks was an impressive degree of financial security.
But as a child of the Depression and a veteran of the pre-civil-rights racial climate, my uncle had some rather peculiar ideas about investing. Year after year, he stuffed the accumulated profits from his small business into dozens of old fruit-juice cans, kept under lock and key in his bedroom closet. Once, when I questioned this strategy, he informed me flatly that he didn't "believe in" banks, nor in the "white folks" who ran them. Luckily, fortune smiled on our family. No burglar or fire ever found those precious cans. But then, neither did the fruit of Uncle Moonie's labors ever find its way into the financial mainstream. 
 My uncle's alienation reflected the racially segregated economy of his day. But the effects of that bygone era continue to distort the economic experience of blacks. For example, among a sample of households polled by the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan, only 14 percent of blacks owned some stocks or mutual fund shares in 1994, the most recent year for which data are available. The overall rate was 41 percent. Another striking finding: More than half of black households had no balances in either a checking or a savings account, compared with just one-sixth of other households.
My uncle Moonie was not big on racial integration. I can remember him back in the 1960's, saying: "I don't give a damn about living next to those white folks. You call me when they start talking about integrating the money!" Well, here we are, some 30 years down the road, and that conversation has yet to begin. Some writers, inclined to minimize the problem of racial inequality in America, are quick to stress that the income gap between blacks and whites has narrowed over the past generation. Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom, authors of "America in Black and White," have made much of the fact that married black couples outside of the South are now at about 90 percent of income parity with comparable whites.
But the wealth gap between the races tells another story altogether. In the Michigan survey, only 4 percent of blacks -- compared with 25 percent of nonblacks -- were worth $170,000 or more. Indeed, half of black families had a net worth below $8,400, while the median for other families was over $63,000. What this means is that while most blacks would have trouble paying cash for a used car, most whites could afford to purchase a new car outright, help a child with the down payment on a first home and still have funds left over.
With blacks having so little disposable income to invest, it is no wonder that they are scarce among equity holders. But their absence from the market has profound implications. For decades to come, wealth created by growing stock values will be sending children to elite colleges, underwriting small-business start-ups and securing a comfortable retirement for American families. And yet, even the newly emergent black middle class is missing out.
How, then, are blacks choosing to manage their money? A 1998 Yankelovich survey probed the investment habits of 1,232 black and white households with annual incomes of $50,000 or higher. The survey found that blacks considered real estate to be the best overall investment
vehicle, while whites chose stocks. Moreover, high-income blacks put a larger percentage of their retirement savings in life insurance, a notoriously low-return investment, than whites did. And they were more likely than whites to express doubts about whether they could trust a financial adviser.
What could account for this psychological gap? Marcus Alexis, an economics professor at Northwestern University and a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, noted: "For the vast majority of high-income black families, this current generation is the first to have any real money to invest. Many of them are, perhaps understandably, averse to taking risks."
Alexis also stressed that factors of history and sociology gave blacks more familiarity with -- and easier access to -- certain relatively low-yield investment vehicles. "The selling of whole life-insurance policies in black communities was done heavily by black agents," he said. "There was a time when this was the best job many talented blacks could aspire to. They went first to their relatives and friends. Something like one-third of the premium in the first couple of years would accrue as commission to the agents."
This affection for insurance drives John Rogers, the founder and president of Ariel Capital Management, to distraction. Twelve years ago at Ariel, Rogers started the first black-managed mutual fund in the nation. Reached in his Chicago offices recently, he talked excitedly about "the huge, untapped market for investment services" among the 1.1 million black households with an annual income of $50,000 or more. Ariel has recently joined forces with the brokerage firm Charles Schwab, holding educational seminars aimed primarily at black audiences in a dozen cities across the country. The seminars are drawing enthusiastic crowds. This is a rather different approach than sending someone's brother-in-law around to hawk a garden-variety life-insurance policy.
My own conversations with black professionals suggest that such efforts are much needed because, even among well-educated people with high incomes, many blacks lack knowledge of (or confidence in) today's variegated financial instruments. One man, who covers the information-technology beat for a major newspaper, seemed embarrassed to admit that he does not know the rate of interest being paid on the funds he routinely deposits each month in a passbook. "I haven't invested in stocks or mutual funds, even though I know I should," he said. "Partly, I'm suspicious of the market, and wonder if I'd lose my pitifully small stake. Then again, I think to myself, I don't have enough money to make it worthwhile. I know this probably isn't true, but there you are."
A somewhat different story was told by a couple, both with advanced degrees, who work for major nonprofit institutions. With a net worth over $300,000, they are wealthier than 99 percent of black families. The husband holds a $150,000 cash-value life-insurance policy sold to him by a childhood friend. Until five years ago, he invested virtually nothing in the market. After attending a financial seminar sponsored by his employer, he began making the maximum contribution to his 401(k). That's it, however. "By the time we finish giving to financially needy people in our respective families, there's not a lot left to invest," he said.
Ultimately, investing one's money means drawing on social, as well as financial, capital. It requires the investor to be conversant with and -- what Uncle Moonie could never do -- to "believe in" the institutions of modern finance: the trading accounts, margin calls, the no-load mutual funds. These institutions now constitute part of the decision-making apparatus of everyday life. Familiarity with them is requisite to full participation in our society. Until this happens, blacks will remain outside the warp and woof of American life. It's time to integrate the money.

HEADLINE: The Big City;
A Case of Island Madness

BYLINE: By John Tierney; John Tierney, a staff writer for the magazine, is the co-author of the novel "God Is My Broker."

 BODY:
For Tom Ortez, Black Friday came on Oct. 15, 1999. The Dow had already fallen 5,000 points in the preceding 10 months, but until that morning he had been able to persuade himself that the Crash of '99 was just a temporary inconvenience. He had even tried arguing that it was good for his company. "In these uncertain times," he told one reporter, "the sophisticated customer knows that a $1,100 Durata handbag is an investment that will last."
An investment -- the line that had worked so well for him through the 90's. His famously durable handbags, made of tent fabric that had withstood a blizzard atop K2, had the patina of practicality demanded by bull-market winners who wanted to pretend they were beyond the excesses of the 80's. Tom, who had grown up in Queens, imbued the company with a vaguely Milanese cachet by naming it Durata and embossed each purse with a discreet insignia of a mountaineer's ice ax. It became the Range Rover of purses. Sales fell off after the Crash, but Tom didn't panic until that Friday, when his chief retail outlet, a chain of high-end clothing stores, filed for bankruptcy. 
 Durata's stock plunged that morning from 46 to 21, which halved Tom's net worth and put him below the magic number he needed for the co-op. He still had plenty of cash to buy it, but that would not be good enough for the co-op board at the Ascotshire. The board, which prided itself on having the highest rejection rate on Central Park West (the building was known among real-estate brokers as the Ask-Not-Here), required liquid assets at least three times the price of the apartment.
It was all slipping away, Tom thought, as he stood at his office window, staring across the midtown rooftops. No bonus this year. No park view for himself and Lily. Maybe no Lily. She affected disdain for her parents' Fifth Avenue values, but now that they were engaged the breeding was showing. She was taking great pains, whenever he was introduced, to mention that the Ortez family had emigrated from Spain, not Latin America. She claimed she was joking about the Ascotshire being on "the wrong side of the park," but she refused even to look in less-exclusive buildings.
Tom opened the window and climbed onto the fire escape. It was the only remaining place for his vice. Cigars had been on the way out even before the Crash, and now they were anathema to any executive in touch with the new, lean Zeitgeist. Tom was puffing furtively when he heard his secretary's frantic voice.
"Tom, what are you doing out there?" He tried to hide the cigar, but she saw the smoke. "Oh, you had me worried for a moment," she said. She smiled at the pitiful sight. "I thought you quit."
"I did," he said. "I was just feeling, I don't know, a little nostalgic."
At noon Tom got his first bit of good news: his banker was free for lunch. On the sidewalk outside his building, he tried to avoid the picketing Durata employees, but it was hard to ignore the old lady in the wheelchair. "Give me back my pension!" she screamed at him. "Give me back my life!" A news crew was recording the confrontation.
In the first months after the Crash, reporters had desperately searched for evidence of a new Great Depression, but except for New York, whose economy was in free fall, the country seemed to be experiencing a relatively normal recession. Americans were living pretty much the way they had lived in 1995, the last time the Dow was at 5,000. Economists tried explaining that disaster was not inevitable, that the Great Depression had been caused not by the Crash of '29 but by stupid banking and trade policies -- none of which interested reporters on deadline. They wanted victims.
Ruined stockbrokers were not sufficiently heart-rending. Nor were most of their clients, although reporters tried a few angles: children forced to transfer to public schools, retirees suing cruise lines to get back their nonrefundable deposits. Jerry Springer created a sensation when a guest on his "I Could Just Kill My Broker!" show took the theme a little too literally, but any sympathy for the murderer vanished when it came out that he owned a $350,000 cabin cruiser.
It was not until the Widows March on Wall Street that the popular anger found its voice. The president of the New York Stock Exchange had to apologize to retired Americans for "the cruel tarnish besmirching your golden years." Jesse Jackson called for corporations to pay "reparations" to retired workers. Steve Forbes proposed refunding all the capital-gains taxes they had paid.
The lady in the wheelchair yelling at Tom had been one of the first seamstresses hired at Durata's factory in the Bronx. When she retired in 1998, collecting $270,000 of Durata stock, it was Tom who handed her the certificates, basking in the image of himself as an enlightened capitalist. Now she was calling the stock-option plan "the hoax pension."
Tom fled around the corner to the restaurant, where he was surprised to recognize the new maitre d'. Last year she was on the cover of Durata's catalogue. Now she was apparently a victim of the Great Model Surplus. She was much friendlier this year. So was the owner of the restaurant, who personally escorted Tom and his banker, Jeffrey, to a prime banquette. They sat down and looked around at the empty tables.
"I guess grocery stores must be doing all right," Tom said. "Anybody else?"
"The bond traders are happy," Jeffrey replied. "My loans outside New York are still performing. But here in the former capital of the world----."
"Come on," Tom said. "New York always bounces back. They wrote us off 10 years ago, and then came the boom."
"All a mirage. Wall Street, real estate, tourism -- the whole economy was built on out-of-towners' money. We were the Disney city, living off strangers who rushed in when they were flush and New York looked hot."
"So now some of them are rushing out," Tom said. "But they'll need us again."
"They need us about as much as they need purses designed for K2. How's your cash flow?"
"Fine," Tom lied. "Your loan is safe. That's not why I called you. I need a personal favor." He explained that he needed to show more liquid assets to the co-op board. "I want to remortgage my place in Southampton and put the cash into the bank."
Jeffrey shook his head. "I can't add to our real-estate portfolio now. We've had three developers and a hotel default this week."
"But it's oceanfront property," Tom said. "When New York gets back on its feet----."
"When New York gets back on its feet, call me."
Tom phoned Lily, who refused to give up on the co-op. She and their broker arranged for Tom to meet privately that afternoon with Abby Green, the president of the Ascotshire's board.
Entering Green's apartment, Tom was not surprised to find peeling paint and crumbling plaster. Green was an heiress who had devoted most of her fortune to the Project for Urban Justice, a foundation that she and her husband ran. The walls of her study were decorated with plaques honoring her as "the Conscience of the Upper West Side."
The Crash, whatever damage it had done to her trust fund, had been good for her career. During the 90's, social activists had become quaint anachronisms, railing against capitalist injustice while the city boomed. Now they were once more in the vanguard, leading the fight for the downtrodden. Green's foundation had just joined with the municipal workers' union to get an injunction preventing the city from using welfare recipients to clean up the city.
Green and Tom had an awkward chat about Durata's picketing employees before they settled down to go over the numbers. "How much would you be paying for the apartment?" Green asked.
"They'd take $3.3 million."
Green looked chagrined. The apartment Tom was trying to buy, a classic nine-room, was in the same line as her own. "God, last year another one in this line went for over five. That's a steal. Well, the board would require $9.9 million in liquid assets." She studied Tom's financial statement. "There's not even $7 million here. I could try to bend the rules a little, but" -- she sighed and lowered her voice to a genteel whisper -- "I'm afraid this won't quite work."
Tom felt angry, humiliated -- but he couldn't help admiring Green's arrogance. The co-op market had collapsed and the Ascotshire was still throwing his money back in his face. It was the foundation of New York's economy, that smug confidence that there would always be more people clamoring to get in, always another buyer willing to pay for a view of Central Park. Tom glanced out the window and sadly contemplated the view of the Great Lawn he couldn't have.
"This is a little awkward," Green said, "but I'd like to say something off the record. Our kids are at the age where they need a yard. We hate the idea of leaving the city, but we'd consider selling this place for $3 million."
Tom assumed she wanted to bargain. They both knew that according to the board's rule, even $3 million was out of Tom's reach. They also knew that this ramshackle place wasn't worth it. "The one for 3.3 has a lot more amenities," Tom said. "It would cost at least a million to bring yours up to that level."
"Oh, I think you're overestimating," Green said, and then she gazed at Tom intensely. "The price is firm. Remember the amenity this one comes with: guaranteed board approval."
So Green would waive the rules for a price. The Conscience of the Upper West Side could be bought. The businessman in Tom appreciated Green's directness. It seemed not a bad deal -- a reasonable price to pay for Lily and the park and the rest of his Gotham aspirations -- but something in Green's eyes bothered Tom. Why was she so desperate to get out of town? If she was willing to sell her apartment -- and her soul -- how many other rats were abandoning ship?
He took another look out the window. He thought he saw sheep gamboling across the Great Lawn, then realized that they were white clumps of garbage blowing in the wind. Maybe he ought to be considering a yard of his own. Westchester would be just as close to the factory in the Bronx. But then, why did he need that factory anyway? There were plenty of workers in Asia who would gladly make his purses, and they wouldn't be able to bother him at lunchtime. He didn't want to abandon the city, but he had to cut costs somehow. His banker was right: who needed a $1,100 purse anymore? Who needed a $3 million apartment? Who needed New York? If, like the 90's stock market, it was all one giant Ponzi scheme. . . .
Tom turned to Green and lowered his voice to a genteel whisper: "I'm afraid this won't quite work."

HEADLINE: Where Melville Paid Homage to a Mountain

BYLINE: By W. D. WETHERELL; W. D. WETHERELL is the author most recently of "North of Now: A Celebration of Country and the Soon to Be Gone" (The Lyons Press).

 BODY:
IT'S a brave and poignant thing to dedicate a novel to a mountain. Brave to match up an imperfect, man-made creation against one of nature's masterpieces; poignant to be so disenchanted with your fellow humans that a hillside seems your one and only friend. Both qualities were evident in Herman Melville's decision in 1852 to dedicate "Pierre," his seventh novel, to the mountain that dominated the view from his study window at Arrowhead, the 18th-century farmhouse in Pittsfield, Mass., he had purchased two years before. Having dedicated his previous novel, "Moby-Dick," to the American writer he valued most, his Berkshire neighbor Nathaniel Hawthorne -- having found Hawthorne's famous shyness nearly impossible to crack -- Melville may well have felt that he had no one human who could understand the wild, tormented novel he had just now completed.
"To Greylock's Most Excellent Majesty," the dedication is headed. "In old times authors were proud of the privilege of dedicating their works to Majesty. A right noble custom, which we of Berkshire must revive. . . . since the majestic mountain, Greylock -- my own more immediate sovereign lord and king -- hath now, for innumerable ages, been the one grand dedicatee of the earliest rays of all the Berkshire mornings, I know not how his Imperial Purple Majesty . . . will receive the dedication of my own poor solitary ray. . . ." 
 It was exactly this irony and tension between the disappointments of human companionship on one hand and the solace of nature's beauties on the other that was to mark the 12 years Herman Melville lived at Arrowhead. In a small upstairs study on the north side of the house, Melville had completed work on "Moby-Dick," facing a window that commands a perfectly framed view of Greylock dominating the ridges to the north.
Greylock, the highest mountain in Massachusetts (3,491 feet) is double humped and surprisingly massive, suggesting in summer -- even without "Moby-Dick" to act as a very large hint -- a green whale breaching through the mist. Today, almost 150 years after he wrote his masterpiece here, it's easy to picture him getting up stiff after a long morning's work, tearing himself away from the great inescapable thing on his writing table, going over to the window, stretching, rubbing his eyes, staring long and hard at the great inescapable thing on the horizon, finding a moment's solace in it, then -- glancing lower to appraise the corn he had planted that spring in the north meadow -- going back to his table to write some more.
For Melville, buying Arrowhead was the consummation of a love affair with the Berkshires that had begun as a boy. His Uncle Thomas had a farm south of Pittsfield (which survives today, enlarged, as the Pittsfield Country Club) and Melville's boyhood visits there during the 1830's, when he was allowed to roam freely over the meadows, woods and hills, were always among his happiest memories.
The Berkshires seem to be the one place this famous traveler felt whole; descended from a famous old New York family on the one side (the Gansevoorts, of Revolutionary War fame), and a venerable New England family on the other (his paternal grandfather was one of the participants in the Boston Tea Party), Melville may have found that these two hereditary halves coexisted best in this border country where New York and New England join edges and meet.
In 1850, having already begun "Moby-Dick," heading a young growing family that included not only his wife and baby son but also his mother and sisters, and tired of Manhattan with its incestuous literary life and bustle, Melville decided on a whim to buy the old farmhouse and its 160 acres (for $6,500) on the southern outskirts of the market town of Pittsfield. He was still young and strong enough that he could face the hard physical toil of farming with confidence. And there was another factor in his decision, a large one -- the presence of Hawthorne just south in Lenox, the promise, at least in Melville's mind, of establishing a fast friendship.
Arrowhead was named by Melville for the Indian souvenirs he found while tilling the fields. After the confusion of moving in, he soon established the routine he was to follow during his years here, which he described in an early letter to Hawthorne (as quoted in the first volume of Hershel Parker's wonderfully comprehensive biography).
"Do you want to know how I pass my time? -- I rise at eight -- thereabouts -- and go to my barn -- say good-morning to the horse, and give him his breakfast. (It goes to my heart to give him a cold one, but it can't be helped.) Then, pay a visit to my cow -- cut up a pumpkin or two for her and stand by to see her eat it -- for it's a pleasant sight to see a cow move her jaws -- she does it so mildly and with such a sanctity. My own breakfast over, I go to my work-room and light my fire -- then spread my M.S.S. on the table -- take one business squint at it, and fall to with a will . . . "
Summers were always the best times at Arrowhead. Melville liked to picnic, there were frequent guests from New York (with better rail service in 1851 than exists today), and excursions were always being arranged to Pontoosuc Lake or Stockbridge Bowl or the steep slopes of Greylock. Melville, along with his writing, had care of the farm, and at the end of the day would sink exhausted in a rocking chair on the narrow porch he had built on the north side of the house, a locale immortalized in "The Piazza Tales."
"I have been ploughing and sowing and raising and printing and praying," he wrote in another letter to Hawthorne, "and now begin to come out upon a less bristling time, and to enjoy the calm prospect of things from a fair piazza at the north of the old farmhouse here."
The winters were especially hard on everyone -- they were more isolated, and between the never-ending work of running the farm, the crushing disappointments that came when literary America began to ignore his books, the pressure of living in a small house with an expanding family (three Melville children were born at Arrowhead), the Berkshires eventually lost much of their charm. Then, too, Hawthorne had moved away in 1851, taking with him much of the literary allure. In 1863, faced with crushing economic pressures and too ill to care for the farm, Melville moved the family back to New York.
Melville's lawyer brother, Allan, took Arrowhead as part of a house swap in 1863, and it remained in the family until the 1920's. (Melville himself visited there well into his old age.) In 1975, the house was obtained by the Berkshire County Historical Society, which maintains it as a shrine to Melville and as a base for its own activities. Visitors can begin their tour in the old barn, where a video places Melville in the context of the wider Berkshire artistic scene and a small gift shop sells books by and about the author. After this, led by a volunteer guide, you proceed into the house itself -- a modest New England farmhouse that seems even more cramped when you remember upwards of 11 people were living here at any one time.
Dominating the downstairs is the massive black chimney that is the central "character" in "I and My Chimney." ("Some say that I have become a sort of mossy old misanthrope, when all the time I am simply standing guard over my mossy old chimney.") Sometime after Melville's own residence, probably at his brother's suggestion, lines from this story were inscribed on the chimney's stone facing, and though they're smoky, a bit hard to read, they remain the most vivid memento of the family's habitation and evidence of the pride they took in Herman's accomplishments.
The house is simply furnished, with a few pieces from Melville's day, family portraits, and at least one real curiosity: the dress Elizabeth Shaw Melville wore as a baby when she sat on the knee of the visiting Marquis de Lafayette in 1824. Upstairs is the main family bedroom; across from it, along a narrow hall, is Melville's study, with a small brass plaque reading: "In this room Herman Melville wrote Moby Dick or The Whale 1850-51."
Preserved with the house, the reconstructed piazza overlooks the cornfield Melville once plowed. A nature trail that starts behind the barn winds its way up the gentle slope through the woods. Walking here on a bright summer day it's easy to block out the encroaching suburbia and imagine what it must have been like when meadows ran uninterruptedly on all sides, guests were piling into the carriage and Herman Melville, free for an afternoon of both his writing desk and the farm chores, was jumping up into the driver's seat with the lithe agility of a foretopman, ready for another voyage, if only to the quiet shores of Pontoosuc Lake.
Arrowhead is one of three Melville shrines in the Berkshires. In the center of downtown Pittsfield is the Berkshire Athenaeum, with its Herman Melville Memorial Room, a priceless collection of mementos from his life and career. This is holy ground for the Melville lover; included are such rarities as the desk he wrote "Billy Budd" on, his wife Lizzie's own writing desk, a pipe he bought on his honeymoon, family portraits and, most poignant of all, the little official badge he wore as a customs inspector on the New York docks during the long years of his literary eclipse.
The third shrine is something very different, a place that has hardly changed at all since Melville's day, one where you can quite literally tread in his footsteps. Monument Mountain is a steep little peak ("a headless Sphinx" Sophia Hawthorne called it) rising above the Housatonic Valley in Stockbridge, a short drive south of Arrowhead. Here, on Aug. 5, 1850, occurred the most famous short hike in American literary history, when a party that included Melville, Hawthorne and Oliver Wendell Holmes ascended through the mountain laurel to the summit for a joyous picnic. This was the first time Hawthorne and Melville had ever met; they were caught by a thunderstorm on top, and took shelter under the craggy boulders. Once the rain left off, as one of the party later described, Melville "bestrode a peaked rock, which ran out like a bowsprit, and pulled and hauled imaginary ropes" like a sailor.
There is much in Melville's life that was unutterably tragic and dark; it's easy to focus too much on the evil kind of enchantment that seems to have taken hold of him after the completion of "Moby-Dick." Here, standing atop Monument Mountain, or bending slightly to peer out the study window at Arrowhead, it's good to remember that other Melville, the writer at the height of his power, the vivacious friend who -- everyone agreed -- could tell stories better than anyone, the athlete who could still lead the others scampering across the rocks.
Here in this Arrowhead study he is at the peak, with the Berkshire winter coming again and he back at work at his desk. The world that is building in him is miraculously reflected by the world he can see outside; Greylock out his window matches the whale inside his head, so when he reaches for his simile it's right there: " . . . and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and midmost of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air."
 
If you go
Arrowhead is a short distance off Routes 7 and 20 at 780 Holmes Road, Pittsfield, Mass. 01201; (413) 442-1793. It is open this year through Oct. 31, from 9:30 A.M. to 5 P.M.; the first tour leaves at 10 A.M., the last tour at 4 P.M. During off-season months, visits may be arranged by calling ahead for an appointment. Admission is $5, $4.50 ages 65 and over, $3 ages 6 to 16, under 6 free. There is a small museum shop in the barn where the video is shown.
The Berkshire Athenaeum, Pittsfield's public library, is at 1 Wendell Avenue at Park Square. Opening hours for most of the year are Monday through Thursday from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M., Friday until 5 P.M. and Saturday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Starting June 29 until around Labor Day, reduced summer hours are Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Tuesday and Thursday until 9 P.M.; Saturday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. The library is closed Sunday year round. The Melville Room is open to visitors who inquire at the local history desk, (413) 499-9486; on the table as you go in to the collection is a pamphlet with a numbered key explaining the various exhibits. The room also houses a research collection for use by scholars.
Monument Mountain is a short drive south of Stockbridge on Route 7; the parking lot is directly across from the Monument Mountain Regional High School. There's a trail marker on the bottom that points two ways, "Easy" to the left, "Steep" to the right. On our visit, we went up Steep -- about a half hour's hike for those in shape -- and came down on Easy -- a gentler but longer stroll through shaded woods.
Every year on the first Sunday in August, the famous Melville-Hawthorne hike up Monument Mountain is commemorated by a festive group hike (on the Easy route) to the summit that is open to all comers; call Arrowhead for information.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Nesconset, L.I.;
A Quiet Smithtown Hamlet

BYLINE: By VIVIEN KELLERMAN 

 BODY:
FOR several years after World War II, the hamlet of Nesconset at the southeastern border of the Town of Smithtown tottered on the brink of turning into a rural slum. It was a dying area dotted with tarpaper shacks and tiny bungalows.
But a housing boom in the 50's to accommodate veterans and their families changed all that. By the 70's home buyers flocked to the hamlet, drawn to its attractive wooded landscape, accessibility to major roads, availability of shopping including the new Smith Haven Mall, now a million square feet, and a well-regarded school district. 
 Today, with only a few remaining parcels to develop, these same features continue to draw new residents, making for a brisk real estate market.
"It's a very hot seller's market," said Arlene Schwartz, the manager of Coldwell Banker Sammis Realty in Smithtown, "and houses are in short supply."
She said that many homes put up for sale were on the market only a day or two and often received multiple bids. When the agency holds an open house for brokers, she said, 50 or more people show up.
Prices for single-family homes range from about $100,000 for a two-bedroom cottage on a quarter-acre, she said, to about $425,000 for new colonials and Victorians on a half acre.
There are five apartment rental complexes in Nesconset, with a total of 578 units. Rents range from about $800 for a one-bedroom unit in an older building to $1,350 for a two-bedroom in a newer building.
The community's lone condominium complex, the Woods at Smithtown, with 56 two-bedroom units, has a pool and clubhouse. Prices range from about $140,000 to $180,000 depending on the size and location of the unit.
Although most new developments have just five or six houses, Winwood Oaks at Old Nicols and Moriches Roads has 52 lots. There are two Victorian models, both with four bedrooms and two-and-a-half baths; one is 2,730 square feet, the other 2,963 square feet. Houses range in price from $290,000 to $320,000 and just six lots remain to be sold.
There are about 100 stores in small shopping strips mostly along Smithtown Boulevard and Lake Avenue, said Al Hornberger, president of the 90-member Nesconset Chamber of Commerce.
The chamber sponsors and annual craft fair/flea market and a festival called Nesconset Day, which this year will be held on Sept. 20. Initiated in 1989, Nesconset Day is held at Nesconset Plaza, which has 24 stores and restaurants and a public library branch. Mr. Hornberger said that there would be craft vendors, amusement rides, a petting zoo, marionette shows and a parade.
A craft fair/flea market is held each May at the Story Book Homes parking lot on Route 347. In addition, Mr. Hornberger said, there is a Christmas tree lighting and a Menorah lighting ceremony in December.
"For a hamlet that does not have the defined borders of a village, it has a lot of community spirit," said Mr. Hornberger.
Among the community's popular restaurants are Sun Dried Tomato, which serves Italian food, Acropolis, with Greek cuisine, and Kasu for Japanese food. All are in Nesconset Plaza.
MR. HORNBERGER, a developer who is a 10-year resident of Nesconset, said that he had chosen the hamlet as a place to live because it is quiet and offers so much to families.
All Nesconset students attend schools in the Smithtown Central School District, which has eight k-5 elementary schools, one middle school and one high school and a total enrollment of 8,023.
Enrollment in the district peaked in the 70's, with 15,000 students in 19 buildings. Over the years, as enrollment declined, several buildings were closed, schools were merged and some were sold. But, said Dr. Christopher Gallagher, district assistant superintendent, a rising enrollment has forced the district to make adjustments.
Only a few years ago, said Dr. Gallagher, it closed two middle schools and one high school, and reorganized them into one junior/senior high school. But as the youngest children move up the ranks, the district now thinks it will have to reopen both of middle schools by 2004.
"We certainly considered selling some of those surplus buildings," Dr. Gallagher said. "Now, we're glad we didn't."
Next September, the Great Hollow Middle School in Nesconset, which had been closed in 1992, will reopen. To pay for the expense of adding space, voters approved a $28 million, 30-year bond issue last year.
Eighty-five percent of last year's 535-student graduating class has gone on to higher education. Two students who were semifinalists in the Westinghouse Science Competition had been enrolled in the high school science preparation program begun in September 1996. The district offers 13 advanced placement courses as well as French, German, Spanish and Italian language courses.
A gifted-and-talented program is available to pupils beginning in grade 3. And Smithtown has joined 15 other districts statewide in a pilot program that integrates technology and math into science instruction in one third- and one fourth-grade class at the Tacken Elementary School in Nesconset.
The state's Cleary School for the Deaf in Nesconset has an enrollment of 75 students ranging in age from three months to 21. The nondenominational day school on five acres has been in Nesconset for 73 years. Sister Catherine Fitzgibbon, superintendent of the school, said that since Cleary is the only school for the deaf in Suffolk County, students come from as far away as Montauk to attend classes.
The public-school system was one of the main reasons Philip and Tammy Kulina chose to live in Nesconset. "My husband grew up in Smithtown, and we wanted our children to go to its schools," said Mrs. Kulina, a hair stylist in Commack, about 15 minutes away. The couple have one son, Tyler, 2.
Mr. Kulina, a Xerox account representative, is frequently on the road, traveling mostly in Nassau County, but Mrs. Kulina said there had never been any question about moving closer to his work.
After looking for about nine months, the Kulinas found a 28-year old, three-bedroom, two-bath ranch on one-quarter acre in Nesconset a year ago. They paid $169,000 for the house, which needed a lot of work, Mrs. Kulina said.
"We like it here," she said. "It's safe and quiet, there are lots of small children, and there's lots for them to do."
In addition to several small pocket parks, there are two larger parks open to town residents with a free parking sticker. The 8.75-acre Sprosera Park on Brown's Road, has four softball fields and a playground. The 6.25-acre Andreoli Park on Gibbs Pond Road has four basketball courts, a horseshoe court and a playground. There is also a freshwater pond where fishing is allowed. No permit is needed.
The 115-acre Lake Ronkonkoma County Park, a nature preserve with walking paths, is also in Nesconset.
UNTIL the beginning of the 20th century the hamlet of Nesconset did not exist. Most of the area was wilderness, heavily forested and virtually impenetrable. The first homesteaders at the turn of the century had to clear these forests for homes and roads.
In 1908, the community was named Nesconset, a modified version of Nesataesconsett, chief of the Nesaquake Indians, who deeded their lands to Richard Smythe, who secured two Smithtown patents, in 1665 and 1677. In 1909, the first post office was opened. Soon after some local businesses sprang up, including two general stores, a florist, candy store, gas and service station.
Because of its proximity to Lake Ronkonkoma, a bustling summer community just to the south, Nesconset enjoyed some of its overflow visitors, who built and rented tiny cottages within its borders. When this summer population dwindled after World War II, Nesconset's economy was quickly affected and the area began to go to seed.
Once development began again, however, population growth seemed unstoppable. Between 1960 and 1970 alone, the population tripled from 3,070 to 10,048.
John Reardon, a Manhattan stockbroker, grew up in nearby Centereach. When he married in 1991, he and his wife, Maureen, looked all over the 140-square-miles of Smithtown, finally finding a small three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath house in Nesconset.
"It was what we could afford, and we liked the area," said Mrs. Reardon.
As their family grew, they decided they needed more space, and in April 1995 they moved into a new 11-home subdivision less than two miles away. Their five-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath Victorian is on .75 acre.
"We never thought of moving anywhere else," said Mrs. Reardon, mother of three young boys. "It's close to everything, the specialty stores in Smithtown, the Costco Price Club, the mall, and all the parkways. We're very happy here. We haven't found a downside yet."

THE GIFT ARMORY: For the last four years, there has been an ongoing debate over what to do with the Nesconset Armory, built in the 50's. The state handed over the 22,000-square-foot building on 7.8 acres to the town in 1994 in exchange for a dollar. An additional 35 acres surrounding the site is also owned by the town. Some say the several plans submitted so far, varying in cost from $3.5 million to $5 million, are too expensive and will create too much traffic and are too expensive. Others argue that they will preclude development of the property. The town is currently considering renovating the building for Recreation Department offices, community meeting rooms, and recreational facilities. A baseball field, tennis courts, a skateboard park, a jogging/walking trail and Olympic size swimming pool are also proposed. Eighteen acres would remain undeveloped. A public hearing on the proposals will probably be held later this month, said Town Councilman Michael Hollander.

It Started With a Yen for Grilled Salmon

BYLINE: By DEBRA GALANT 

 BODY:
ALL I wanted was to be able to create fire, in my own backyard, without the help of a man. I was thinking grilled salmon -- on weeknights. Roasted red peppers, Vidalia onions, corn -- anytime I desired.
Nine years ago, when we moved to the suburbs, my mother-in-law offered us, as a housewarming present, the backyard grill of our choice. I had no strong opinions then. But my husband, a self-proclaimed charcoal purist, did. He envisioned hickory briquettes, the authentic smells and flavors of barbecues past. Plus, he was a little scared of propane (not lighter fluid, though). We wound up with a plain charcoal grill in a charming 1970's shade of avocado. 
 It served us well for eight New Jersey summers. We grilled salmon, red peppers, Vidalia onions, corn. But not on weeknights, not anytime I desired. The one time I was put in charge of the fire, I stood there baffled, newspaper in one hand, cell phone in the other. "Where do you put the newspaper?" I whimpered. "What about the lighter fluid? Do you close the lid?"
Lighting the grill was, in my opinion, a Hansel-and-Gretel operation. You practically had to climb inside to get it going. In the end, I chickened out and flagged down the first male neighbor I could find.
Over the years, I discovered that we knew people on the other side of the charcoal/propane divide. The wives told me that starting a gas grill was as simple as turning on a switch. Moreover, they had kept propane in their backyards for years without anything ever blowing up. So when the Internal Revenue Service decided to bestow its generosity on me this year, I knew exactly what I wanted. A gas grill.
Luckily -- or so I thought -- I still had a subscription to Consumer Reports Online. One day, when I should have been working, I printed out the most recent feature on gas grills. It spoke of B.T.U.'s, ignition tests, grilling efficiency and easy-clean surfaces. Everything under $200 it dismissed with the basic message: "You could do better."
What the ratings forgot to mention was anything about esthetics. They didn't say: this sucker is ugly and will take up half your yard. If you buy this grill, you will be the laughing stock of your quaint gas-lit neighborhood. Armed with the scientific data, I dragged my husband to Home Depot. For $199 ($234 assembled, $283 delivered), we found a model with a porcelain easy-clean grilling surface, two warming racks, enormous plastic trays on either side and a nice little perch in front for utensils. It came in a very 1990's shade of hunter green. It even had an impressive name: The Grillmaster.
My husband, who had accepted the propane decision grudgingly, gently tried to warn me: this was one big grill. His exact words, I later learned, were: "This is a monster." (I hadn't been listening.) He tried steering me to a slightly smaller model, which I dismissed with a haughty sigh. It looked like a trinket, and I was sure that Consumer Reports would not approve.
My husband's warning began to haunt me during the three days between the grill's selection and its delivery. I started noticing various gas grills around the neighborhood, delicate things with little wooden slats for trays. In comparison to my Grillmaster, they looked like marvels of grill economy: backyard haiku.
Finally the day of the delivery arrived. But I had forgotten that my children were performing that very morning in the school music program, which would make it impossible for me to fulfill my consumer's duty to stay chained to my house. Daringly, I left a special message on the answering machine, instructing Home Depot I would be home by 10 A.M. When I got home, at 10:15, there was an irked response from Home Depot.
To punish me, they fed my Grillmaster steroids. It swaggered in, right after lunch, and took its new position on my patio, where it began staring down the old charcoal grill. I put the vinyl cover on, and it grew another three feet. I hadn't bought a grill; I'd bought a boat. Not just any boat, the Titanic. I didn't just have buyer's remorse. I was afraid I'd have to register Republican and trade my car in for a Cadillac to make the grill feel at home.
I was only slightly mollified when our hard-core clique of charcoal purists came over for a barbecue two days later and beheld my new technological wonder like cave men discovering fire. Of course, they probably wouldn't have laughed so hard if I'd bought a cuter model.
There is a lesson in all of this, maybe several. Never leave important decisions to Consumer Reports. Listen when a man who outweighs you by 60 pounds says something's big.
And, oh yes, be careful of what you wish for, because you just might buy it.

Weehawken's 10-Year Wallflower Lands a Tenant

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
CONSTRUCTED nearly a decade ago but never occupied, the 312,000-square-foot office building at 300 Boulevard East in Weehawken has been the Hudson County riverfront's reigning wallflower.
Now its turn to dance seems to have come. With Crown Properties of Garden City, L.I., in place as a new owner and a $1.5-million renovation complete, the three-story building, now called Riverview at Lincoln Harbor, has attracted its first tenant. 
 Earlier this month EDS, a technology-services provider formerly owned by Ross Perot, signed a five-year lease for 35,000 square feet. By August it will relocate from three scattered locations elsewhere in the state to the structure, which is minutes from the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel.
"The truth is that with not a inch of space left on the waterfront the building has timing on its side," said Seena Stein, president of Newmark Partners of Rutherford, the New Jersey operation of Newmark & Company, a national brokerage.
Vacancies are decreasing and rents are rising along the Hudson County riverfront, which comprises 10 million square feet of office space mostly in Jersey City, but also in Hoboken and Weehawken. And large blocks of space, which are in short supply, are something Riverview at Lincoln Harbor has to offer.
As of the first quarter, the vacancy rate on the Hudson County riverfront was 8.2 percent and the rate for Class A space was 3.3 percent, among the lowest in the 11-county northern New Jersey marketplace, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the national commercial brokerage. With average asking rents for prime space on the waterfront at $30.85 per square foot it is also one of only three submarkets where rents for such space is that high. (The other submarkets are the I-78 corridor in Somerset County and along Routes 10 and 24 in Morris County.)
"At this point the growth market in North Jersey is the waterfront," said Robert P. Antonicello, president of the ACI Group, a real estate services firm in Jersey City. "It is no longer a frontier."
This is good news for Crown, which acquired the Weehawken building for $15 million in cash last July, becoming its fourth owner. The acquisition marks the initial foray into the New Jersey market for Crown, which owns some 5 million square feet of office space throughout the nation, three million of it in the New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Philadelphia area.
Joseph V. Scimone, director of acquisitions for Crown, said his company had bought 300 Boulevard East "because we felt that, with a little vision and a lot of money, it would turn itself around."
Despite the building's riverfront location, its checkered ownership history, coupled with the fact that it was caught in the recession, has kept it from attracting tenants -- except for a billboard company that rents rooftop space for $200,000 for a huge Toyota sign seen by thousands of daily Lincoln Tunnel commuters a day.
The structure was built on speculation by Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus, which also developed the nearby 1.5-million-square-foot, two-building Lincoln Harbor mixed-use complex where another 1.5 million square feet of space can eventually rise.
In fact, 300 Boulevard East was actually built around a smaller structure that was once used to store sets and props for the Metropolitan Opera Company in Manhattan. Columns from the original building are all that remain.
By the time Riverview at Lincoln Harbor was completed in 1989 the market had soured and tenants has vanished, leaving the building empty and its interior space unfinished. Two years later Hartz gave back the building in lieu of foreclosure to its lender, Chase Manhattan, which sold it in 1995 to Archon, a Manhattan-based investment firm.
Because Archon was unwilling to divide the building into smaller units, no tenants were acquired, brokers said. They also said that Archon, like Chase, made no effort to spruce up the building to help it compete in a market that by 1996 was slowly improving.
CROWN bought the vacant building the following summer "at a decent price," feeling that that once it was upgraded it could woo tenants, said Mr. Scimone. "We knew we needed to invest money in the building, which was essentially mothballed for a decade, to make it attractive," he added, noting that it would be marketed for use by multiple tenants.
As part of the renovation, completed last February, the company gave the building a new lobby and upgraded the elevators. It also spent more than $40,000 on new landscaping.
To gain its first tenant, Mr. Scimone said that Crown was leasing space to EDS at $18 a square foot. (Comparable space along the waterfront rents for $25.)
"That deal was an ice-breaker, a way to get things going," he said, adding that as the building leases over the next 18 months rents will go to the low-$20's for the next few deals and top out in the mid-$20.
EDS, which is based in Plano, Tex., searched for seven months and looked at more than a dozen sites before selecting Riverview at Lincoln Harbor. "It was the best fit for the company's current and future needs," said Melissa Brown, a company spokeswoman, adding that EDS expected to expand within the building in the near future.
"The company wanted to be accessible by car to New York City and the fact that this building sits just outside the Lincoln Tunnel and is close to the Holland Tunnel was a major plus," said Eric Witmondt, president of Associated Realty, based in Parsippany, which represented EDS.
Ms. Stein, of Newmark Partners, which represented Crown, said that with EDS moving to Riverview at Lincoln Harbor "the building is viable in the eyes of potential tenants." (Insignia/ESG now handles leasing at the building.)
Mr. Scimone is hoping for a domino effect, given the space squeeze in northern New Jersey in general and along the waterfront in particular.
The lack of prime space has pushed leasing activity along the riverfront, which continues at a steady pace, to older buildings that are being renovated to modern office space. One is the 164,000-square-foot building at 2 Montgomery Street in Jersey City, which the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company recently leased. And at the 300,000-square-foot building at 30 Montgomery Street, 16 tenants have signed on in the last 11 months for a total of 37,801 square feet of space, raising its occupancy level to 94 percent from 72 percent.
At the same time the riverfront is getting two new buildings. Last month the Lefrak Organization of Rego Park, Queens, started construction on a 561,000-square-foot building at its 60-acre Newport mixed-use development in Jersey City. And this month Hartz is to break ground on a 419,000-square-foot tower about a mile south in the city.
Mr. Scimone said Riverview at Lincoln Harbor would be a less expensive alternative to those buildings as well as those in downtown Manhattan, where rents are escalating. Because the Weehawken building has large floors it is well-suited to back-office operations , although Mr. Scimone said Crown was not ruling out its potential as executive offices.
But attracting companies from downtown Manhattan -- especially financial concerns, the riverfront's main tenant source -- may be difficult since the building is not near a PATH station, which brokers said was a key draw to such employers. The Weehawken site is five blocks from ferry service to midtown Manhattan, but the closest PATH station is in neighboring Hoboken.
"The typical downtown financial firm wants that immediate access by PATH for a quick commute across the river," said Edwin H. Cohen, executive director at the Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield.
Mindful of that, Mr. Scimone said Crown intends to provide shuttle service for tenants to both the Hoboken PATH station and the Weehawken ferry. And looking to the future, he said there will be the 20.5-mile light rail system that will run along the riverfront with a station planned next to Riverview at Lincoln Harbor.

HEADLINE: Languages And Learning, The Debate Simmers

BYLINE: By MELINDA TUHUS 

 BODY:
AS voters in California rejected bilingual education last week, a General Assembly committee in Connecticut was studying the effectiveness of bilingual education for this state's 20,000 non-English-speaking children.
In the intense debate, one side says bilingual classes are necessary to ease non-English-speaking children into regular classes and to prevent them from falling behind. Another side says these children are being isolated and held back in bilingual classes. 
 In Connecticut, several times over the past decade, Tom Scott of Milford, formerly a Republican State Senator, proposed legislation that would have eliminated transitional bilingual education. "It's not a matter of whether we teach new arrivals English, it's how we do it," said Mr. Scott, who is now a talk show host on a New Haven-area radio station. "Immersion is what we did in this country for a long time. It's only since the 60's that we have kids segregated by language."
Mr. Scott's bills were defeated. Since he left office, the debate has died down in Connecticut. Last fall, however, the legislature set up a committee to look into bilingual education. A chairwoman of the committee, State Representative Nancy Beals, Democrat of Hamden, said legislators were concerned that after several years in the program, many youngsters still had not learned English. But she also understands it's a complicated problem. "Children seem to need a firm foundation in one language before going on to another one," said Ms. Beals. "You would expect that by age 5, a child would have had that in their own language. Unfortunately we are finding that's not always true even among English-speaking kids. This seems to be an argument against total immersion for those children."
Ms. Beals said her own children learned French one year when the family lived in France, with vigorous reinforcement from her and her husband.
Mr. Scott, who still believes in his cause, said the issue has abated because no one else was as committed to it and as willing to take the heat. "The attacks on me were nasty," he said, "and came from the taxpayer-funded bilingual gravy train in Hartford and Washington."
Patricia McCann-Viseppo, a long-time member of the New Haven school board and a supporter of the district's bilingual program, sees things differently. Ms. McCann-Viseppo said the "bilingual gravy train" Mr. Scott refers to is a myth. "Bilingual education programs receive just $116 a year per pupil more than regular classroom programs," she said. "That's not a big motivator. It's also a myth that bilingual teachers would be out of jobs if the bilingual program were cut. They are certified, tenured teachers. If you have a certain number of kids per teacher by contract, you have to have a contracted number of teachers for the total number of students, whether they're in bilingual programs or not."
Bilingual classes must be offered by any school district in the state that has at least 20 students speaking a particular language other than English. Seventeen districts offer such programs. The first language of the vast majority of the students in bilingual programs is Spanish; the others are Portuguese, Haitian Creole, Polish, Vietnamese, Lao, Khmer and Albanian. Bridgeport offers programs in six languages, New Britain in three, while most of the rest offer classes in Spanish.
When there are fewer than 20 children in a district speaking the same language, they are offered classes in English as a Second Language rather than bilingual classes. And there's one district, Windham, where children participate in a two-way English-Spanish bilingual program.
The state consultant for bilingual education, George De George, said, "The bottom line is to educate the children. We have to have a quality program. It takes five to seven years for results to show up on standardized tests given in English."
Ms. McCann-Viseppo said supporters of bilingual education have done a poor job of educating people about the realities of such education.
"I think there is a lot of misinformation," she said.. "People don't understand how difficult it is to learn a language for academic use as opposed to conversational use. Parents are anxious when they see their kids in a bilingual education program for two or three years and hear them speaking English," but the children have not been moved into regular classes. Lisette McGowan is in charge of bilingual education for the New Haven schools. About 1,800 students are in the program each year, almost one of every 10 students in the district. Ms. McGowan said many Hispanic parents whose children speak English want their children in the program to learn Spanish as a way of maintaining their cultural heritage. But these students are not eligible.
The transitional bilingual program offers subject matter instruction in Spanish. Beginning students take all core subjects in Spanish, but from the start they are in regular classes for homeroom, physical education, art and music. So, in the New Haven program, at least, students are never as isolated as some critics charge. They gradually take more and more courses in English as a Second Language, then in regular classes, until they are fully enrolled in regular classes. But even then, Ms. McGowan said, students should continue language development in their first language so they don't forget it.
"We really want our students to be fully competent in two languages," she said. "We'd like to move toward bilingualism even for our native English-speaking students. In order to compete in a global economy, you need more than one language. We feel that the children in bilingual education have something to offer to native speakers of English, to expose them to their language and culture. We want to move away from the idea that bilingual education is compensatory."
Ms. McGowan said fewer than 1 percent of children entering kindergarten who are eligible for the program decline participation, and that of those who do participate, only 1 percent drop out while staying in the system. She adds that 60 percent of the students in the program have been enrolled for two years or less. Many of their families are transient, moving back and forth between Puerto Rico and Connecticut or around the tristate area. Statewide, a quarter of the students in bilingual programs move out of district each year.
Ms. McGowan said she is frustrated that the school district cannot provide more help to those students who speak a language other than Spanish. There aren't enough of them to constitute a bilingual class, so they get tutoring in English as a Second Language.
"Many of them do not do very well," Ms. McGowan said. "Their success is predicated on how good their prior schooling has been. They suffer tremendously if their education has been disrupted by war, for example. We get lots of students who have not attended school at all."
If, on the other hand, children arrived in New Haven with a good educational background, albeit in a language other than English, Ms. McGowan said they have a much easier time.
"If they already have skills in their native language, they can transfer everything; all they need are new linguistic labels."
There are many different kinds of bilingual programs, and some work better than others. New Haven teachers and administrators have visited successful programs in other states and hope to duplicate some of what they've seen. One such program, called Amigos, is in Cambridge, Mass. It is a comprehensive two-way bilingual Spanish/English program from kindergarten through eighth grade. Native speakers of each language learn the other language.
The Connecticut state consultant for bilingual education, Mr. DeGeorge, said the Amigos program was the model for the state's only existing two-way bilingual program, in Windham.
"The kids help each other with the language," he said, "and also do some study of subject content in each of the native languages." Many studies have been done on the best way to teach English to non-English speakers. A committee of experts from top universities and the Center of Applied Linguistics recently sifted through the studies. They concluded that transitional bilingual education holds a slight but clear advantage over the immersion method. The committee concluded that there is no one answer for children who need to learn English.
The principal of an elementary school in New Haven that serves a largely Hispanic population made some innovations in the bilingual program there, with good results. Alicia Carraballo has been principal of Hill Central School for five years.
"I was concerned that because of the way the program was structured, kids in kindergarten through second grade were only learning isolated words in English," said Ms. Carraballo. "It wasn't until the third grade that they were in a paired English/Spanish model."
She continued: "In fourth grade all the children take the Connecticut Mastery Test, in English, of course. Our kids were very frustrated at their scores. They were crying; they were very upset. We looked to see how we could increase English instruction while maintaining instruction in Spanish. Last year we did away with separate second and third grades. We put them together and assessed their English ability."
And there was more, Ms. Carraballo explained: "We looked at teacher strengths and developed a departmental approach. We have students who are grouped together based on English proficiency. We extended the time spent with the teacher in English and worked on writing. This year for the first time we have bilingual students who have met the state standards for fourth graders in writing. It's early, but I am pleased with the initial results. The closer we focus on the students' needs and abilities, and individualize instruction, the better we do."
There's no doubt that non-English-speaking parents in Connecticut want their children to learn English. The only question is what method works best. Maria Ruiz has three children at Hill Central School. She's convinced that the transitional bilingual program is the way to go.
Ms. Ruiz, speaking in Spanish, said: "I grew up in Puerto Rico. I've been in New Haven for five years, and I lived in New Jersey four years before that. I want my children to learn English, but not to forget their Spanish. We speak Spanish at home. My children have learned English in school. They're teaching me English. My fourth grader and even my second grader are fluent in English now. My first grader is half and half."
She continued: "There is a lot of discrimination here against people who don't speak English. I know. Fortunately, that will not happen to my children." She added that in the fall she is planning to study English.
Ms. Ruiz said she thinks the elimination of a transitional bilingual approach would be a bad idea. "For children who come here and don't know English, that would be a terrible thing. Sometimes kids come here from other places with good grades and don't know English. They would really suffer. You have to go little by little. My children all had help."
Ms. Ruiz's 9-year-old daughter, Queila Galan, said the bilingual program was fine. But when the little girl was asked how she would have felt if she'd been put immediately in all English classes, she responded -- in English -- in a way that might surprise her mother. "It's better to do it all in English," said Queila, "because English is my second language and I need to learn it better."
Queila's response demonstrates the different possibilities for all non-English-speaking children trying to learn English. While many children will swim when tossed into an immersion program, others will get lost and fall farther and farther behind.
Nationally, Hispanic high school students have a much higher dropout rate than students of most other ethnic backgrounds. While all the reasons aren't clear, experts say that language difficulties can't be discounted. In New Haven, the drop-out rate is just two percentage points above the proportion of Hispanic children in the system, which is 27 percent.
The state legislative committee studying bilingual education is forging on. Ms. Beals said she has been impressed with some of the New Haven schools the committee has visited, because of the quality of the teaching and the response of the children, who were speaking in English and Spanish. They plan to visit several more schools around the state, and issue a report in January.

HEADLINE: ART;
From Cuba, 5 Artists Concerned With the Darker Side of Life

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR 

DATELINE: THE BRONX

 BODY:
THE show at the Longwood Arts Gallery here, is the sum of installations by Abel Barroso, Tania Bruguera, Sandra Ceballos, Manuel Pina and Lazaro Savaadra. All five artists come from Cuba, not as immigrants but as guests awarded residencies at arts organizations in Buffalo, Chicago, Houston, New York City and San Diego.
The operation, which began last winter, was organized by Holly Bloch, executive director of Art in General, an alternative space in TriBeCa, and Betti-Sue Hertz, director of the Longwood Arts Project/Bronx Council on the Arts, and is supported by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, the Lef Foundation and the Reed Foundation. 
 The exhibition, "1990's Art From Cuba," would be nothing without its catalogue, which includes interviews with and biographies of the artists, most of whom are unknown in the United States, along with essays by the curators and contributions from authorities who live in Cuba or were born there.The "Longwood Five" range from 27 to 37 in age and except for Mr. Pina, who studied mechanical engineering in the former Soviet Union, all are graduates of Cuban art schools.
This is no ordinary show of assemblage art, for it lacks the traits that have become part and parcel of the genre, notably obsessive-compulsiveness, concern with surface effects and a sentimental regard for decay. The artists have come, some for the first time, to a country inundated with objects, and yet none of them seem overwhelmed by such horrifying profusion. On the contrary, they make their points with minimal fuss, and should they change their approach in the future it will surely be because of an improvement in their country's economic situation rather than their own encounter with consumerism.
Mr. Savaadra states in his interview that while it originated in the academy installation art was at first regarded as "ideological diversionism" but is now accepted, thanks to the influence of imported magazines. Of the three works presented by this artist, the first consists of a corner table for one with two wineglasses containing red candles and, propped against the facing wall, a mirror scrawled with the words, "I don't expect anyone but insist that someone must come."
For his second piece, Mr. Savaadra drops roughly carved wood puppets on the floor in four rows, seven to a row, where they lie as if crumpled by their fall from the strings dangling overhead. Then the artist produces a formation of nine headless ducks led by one that has a head and carries those of the flock behind him in a string bag. The birds are carved out of styrofoam and painted in dark colors except for their truncated necks, which are daubed bright red, and they fly across a wall under the title, "Dying Free."
Temporarily separated from her home, Tania Bruguera, empathizes with those for whom the condition is permanent, be they Cuban immigrants or the lost and forgotten Americans in Chicago who inspired her performance at School of the Art Institute there. As a collection of nine black and white photographs taken in that city's homeless "zone" at night -- cardboard boxes, old clothes and other trash -- Ms. Bruguera's contribution is disappointingly static and improves little when viewed as the byproduct of her performance.
Sandra Ceballos is also concerned with the darker aspects of life, but she uses hosts of pink pills, stockings stuffed with wadding, blood-stained fabric, pocket knives and color photographs of what appears to be human tissue. Her assemblages, mercifully, only hint at horror. One example is the soft sculpture that, suspended in a cradle of upholstery bands, may or may not symbolize a fetus; another is the skein of blond wool braided to look like hair and hidden under a cloth.
Pina and Abel Barroso are equally conscious of Cuban history, but Mr. Pina, a photographer, has something to say about contemporary life on the mainland, too. The first of two large computer-generated prints, "Mix the Colors," features a black woman against palm trees, while the second, "Cross the Border," focuses on a pair of shapely thighs in a miniskirt. Mr. Barroso's disaffection, on the other hand, is focused on greed and avarice and is symbolized by eight rocking horses. Rendered in a large watercolor, the horses ply the waves to and from Cuba but, carved out of plywood and decorated with black woodcuts incorporating cameras, telephones and money, they ride the floor of the gallery.
A show that is definitely more than the sum of its contents, it moves to Chicago after closing here on June 27. The numbers to call for information are (718) 409-6445 and (212) 219-0473.

HEADLINE: ATLANTIC CITY;
Back at Home Port

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

 BODY:
THE paint was wet and the seasickness bags were in the mail, but Scott Chew, president of the Atlantic City Packet Company, was certain last week that the tall ship Young America would make its first scheduled voyage from Gardner's Basin on Friday, when 100 Atlantic County school age children are to get a free taste of life under full sail at the start of the Omnipoint Seafood Festival.
"The only thing that could possibly stop us is the weather, and it would have to be pretty extreme to keep us in," Mr. Chew said. "The hull is made of steel-reinforced concrete. This is probably the sturdiest sightseeing boat you're going to find anywhere. You'd need a pretty big blow to keep us in port." 
 Mr. Chew, his wife, Millie, and their son, Rayford, have been living aboard the ship since they bought the twin-masted 125-foot schooner in November. Now, with a marketing assistant, a captain and a crew of five, the Chews are preparing the vessel for a triumphal return to service.
"This is one of those jobs most people dream about but never do," Mr. Chew said. "My wife and I had been talking about it for 12 years. When our son, Rayford, came into this world, we didn't feel he was old enough to do it. He's 11 now, and he loves the ship as much as we do."
He hopes the sight of the ship will draw more than stares from the Boardwalk. "The ship means a lot to many people around here," he said. "We have to show the people that it's back, for good."
Built on Long Island in 1976, the ship was brought to Atlantic City with the promise of transforming the Gardner's Basin marina area into a non-gambling tourist attraction. During the summer season, it took as many as 100 passengers on two-and-a-half-hour voyages. The ship was the city's most spectacular non-gambling tourist attraction for most of the 1980's. A favorite of high-rolling gamblers, conventioneers, casino workers and locals enamored of tall ships, the vessel nevertheless encountered financial hard times during the recession of 1987 and stopped sailing in the early 1990's.
In 1994, Steven Pagels, a New England businessman, bought the ship, towed it to Maine and spent $300,000 to repair it. Last year, Mr. Pagels was going to use the ship for chartered Caribbean sailing cruises when Mr. Chew, who had previously sailed on Lake Michigan and in the Caribbean, answered an advertisement for a business opportunity in a trade magazine. He decided to take the ship back to Atlantic City because "it had made a name for itself here," he said. "There were enough people who had sailed on it and thought that this was the highlight of their stay."
Although one casino has chartered the ship for a sail, "I haven't gone after the casinos in a big way because I don't want us to get into a situation in which we depend on them for our survival," Mr. Chew said. "I've also heard they tend to want their customers to stay indoors. This is a definite outdoor experience."
Passenger benches cover most of the deck space, and Mr. Chew advises prospective passengers to wear hats and take plenty of sunscreen. Passengers are permitted below deck only to visit the lavatories. "There's no hot tub, no sauna, no video screens, no computer games, no frills or extras of any kind," Mr. Chew said. "If it rains, we'll all get wet, which I figure should be the least of our worries."
Hoping he'll attract enough passengers, at $25 for adults and $15 for children 12 and under, is "keeping me awake at nights," he said. To break even, the ship must sail at least twice a day with at least 10 passengers.
"We want to sail as late as mid-September and then maybe go down to the Caribbean for charters in the winter, and then come back here for the spring. If things don't work out, we can always stay in the Caribbean. But I'm getting to like it here. In the Caribbean, they have lots of tall ships. Nobody even looks. Here, we're the biggest thing around. I get a lot of wows from the landlubbers."
Beyond "telling some people that we're here," Mr. Chew said he had not received any assistance from the city's tourism and convention bureau or the Casino Reinvestment and the Development Authority.
"I wouldn't have minded a little more than that, but at least, if we make it, we can say we did it on our own," he said. "At this point, we've had to put off any kind of celebrating. We don't have a bottle of champagne for the first voyage out. We can't afford it."

HEADLINE: 'Smaller Inventory Of Homes'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Buyers Finding Smaller Inventory of Homes" April 19 portrays the current market reality of dwindling inventory and its consequent effect on home sales. There can be little doubt that pent-up demand created after nearly 10 years of flat home sales and low interest rates has confronted home buyers with a reduced supply of housing. However, homebuyers need not abandon hope of being able to negotiate a fair and reasonable deal on a house. 
Although the examples cited of multiple offers and bidding wars accurately depict a market with renewed fervor, my experience as a buyer's broker in Westchester County is that the clear majority of the houses on the market are not subject to the type of buying frenzy described in the article. A substantial percentage of the homes listed in the Westchester Multiple Listing Service have been on the market for several months, which is a normal waiting period for the sale of a house. Consequently, buyers in many instances are in a position to negotiate with a seller on a level playing field.
While the instances of multiple offers are indicative of a new trend favoring sellers, it is not necessarily representative of a marketplace where buyers are left out in the cold. Buyers who exercise care in searching for a house and adhere to fundamental principles of investing can still make a sound purchase in the current market environment. For the astute homebuyer, the message contained in the article is not one of despair. Rather, it is that caution should be the watchword when purchasing a home, particularly in a fast-paced market.

HEADLINE: The Preservation Band That Sets the Tone

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
THE architectural firm of Beyer Blinder Belle was born in the tumultuous year of 1968, with a bow to Jane Jacobs and a commitment to the maverick ideas of community-based planning and rehabilitation rather than bulldozing. Today, it finds itself where its founders never expected to be: on the inside track.
The rebuilding and restoration of Grand Central Terminal? That's Beyer Blinder Belle. The remodeling of Rockefeller Center? Beyer Blinder Belle. The Ford Center for the Performing Arts, where "Ragtime" is playing? Beyer Blinder Belle again. 
 Across 42d Street from the Ford Center, Beyer Blinder Belle is designing a hotel and entertainment complex for Forest City Ratner. Allied with the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, it is one of three teams competing for the new Pennsylvania Station concourse that is proposed within the General Post Office on Eighth Avenue.
The tiny Swedish Cottage in Central Park bears the mark of Beyer Blinder Belle, as do renovations at La Guardia Airport, new approaches to the Williamsburg Bridge, a study of the Yankee Stadium area, the revival of the Sun Building near City Hall, a new museum in the South Street Seaport and master plans for Columbia University and Governors Island.
If Beyer Blinder Belle seems to be everywhere, it is because preservation has become an integral part of development in the years since the firm was founded by John H. Beyer (rhymes with spire), now 65 years old; Richard Blinder (rhymes with tinder), who is 62 and John Belle, 65.
Having backed into landmarks practice through rehab work, they embraced it in 1979 by adding James Marston Fitch, regarded as the dean of American preservation, to the partnership. Today, the firm enjoys an influence out of proportion to its modest size. What makes its emergence so remarkable is that the firm does not have a recognizable style, even in the numerous buildings it has designed from scratch, which include a slender, glass-clad 45-story apartment tower at 300 East 93d Street.
There is no such thing as a Beyer Blinder Belle signature project, unless it is the renovation of an iconic landmark like Grand Central that leaves the public with little sense of modern intervention.
"I've received more favorable comments on the terminal than on any other aspect of our operations," said E. Virgil Conway, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. "There have been a lot of changes but at the same time, the overall appearance is one of restoration."
Asked to name the greatest influence on their practice, the founding partners do not cite a master architect or planner.
Instead, they point to Ms. Jacobs, a writer and Greenwich Village activist, who declared in "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" (1961) that "cities need old buildings so badly it is probably impossible for vigorous streets and districts to grow without them" -- apostasy to a design establishment that was pursuing urban renewal.
In a telephone interview from Toronto, where she now lives, Ms. Jacobs recalled the emergence of Beyer Blinder Belle.
"They were looking at the fabric of the community," she said. "That was very welcome and very exciting, that there were professionals who were, at last, doing that. Also, they recognized that time is important in these things. A community can't just come by waving a wand. It has history. History was, to the modernists, an enemy. So this was a very radical realization. And an important one."
Beyer Blinder Belle's grounding in community-based planning has served it well.
"People look at them as the firm that gets things through agencies," said Laurie Beckelman, a former chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. "But they also have compassion and sympathy toward the community, and they can work with both. They are not seen as slam-dunk, but as fair, reasonable and balanced."
It remains to be seen how long this firm -- or any firm with so many high-powered clients -- can maintain that reputation.
O NE of the prices of success is that you begin to think like a developer," said Barbaralee Diamonstein, chairwoman of the Historic Landmarks Preservation Center. "That may or may not be a bad thing." Beyer Blinder Belle is to be "congratulated and cautioned," she said. "They learned early on to merge the historical with the commercial. They have obviously perfected that and made it agreeable both to developers and to the public and private organizations, commissions and institutions that have to approve these things. A large aspect of architecture is presentation, and they are virtuosi at it."
But the firm's impressive presentation charting the many changes over time to Rockefeller Center has done little to persuade preservationists that it would be appropriate to enlarge the storefronts along Fifth Avenue and diminish the red-granite setting of Prometheus.
Although the New York Landmarks Conservancy supports the plan, it has come under fire from the Municipal Art Society, Historic Districts Council and others.
At the same time, Upper West Siders are attacking plans for a 41-story apartment tower by Beyer Blinder Belle that would adjoin the Y.M.C.A. on West 63d Street, near Central Park West. It would rise on the site of the former McBurney School, whose facade is to be preserved. Besides the sheer size of the mid-block building, opponents deplore the segregation of entrances to the lower-income rental housing at the base and the high-priced condominiums above.
And even Mr. Fitch questioned the firm's plans on behalf of Donald J. Trump to strip the St. Moritz Hotel on Central Park South to its steel skeleton and erect a new facade that would evoke, but not duplicate, the original. (Debate over that project became moot in April when Mr. Trump lost the property to the hotelier Ian Schrager.)
The future probably holds more quandaries of this kind: is preservation best served by rigorous replication of historic features or by new construction, sympathetic in spirit, that sometimes involves the demolition of existing architectural fabric?
"It's much easier to be doctrinaire when there's less at stake," said Hugh Hardy, of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, a firm whose restoration work includes the New Amsterdam Theater. "Their success will inevitably lead them into facing increasingly difficult issues which have as much to do with the marketplace and the client base as with the inherent ideology of the firm."
The challenge is evidently relished by the younger partners who are gradually assuming the reins at Beyer Blinder Belle.
"We've redefined what is meant by preservation," said Richard Southwick, 44, a partner since 1993. "It may mean moving a building down the block or building a new theater where two older theaters stood."
(The historic Empire Theater was rolled 170 feet along West 42d Street as part of the Forest City Ratner project. The Ford Center, designed with Kofman Engineering for Garth H. Drabinsky, incorporates significant elements from the Lyric and Apollo Theaters, but both playhouses were razed.)
"The greatest and most enriching architecture is that which layers the new and old, allowing each to express itself honestly," said Frederick Bland, a 52-year-old designer. In 1978, he became the first partner at Beyer Blinder Belle outside the original trio.
"There is nothing so precious that it cannot accommodate some new use," Mr. Beyer said. This may not be pure preservationist orthodoxy, but Beyer Blinder Belle has long prided itself in being a bit out of step. "Controversy contributes to our credibility as architects who are always reaching, always trying," Mr. Beyer said.
It seems fitting that this partnership should have emerged from the 1960's, when so many conventions were upended.
As the decade began, all three men were in Cambridge, Mass., unknown to one another. Mr. Beyer, a native of Weehawken, N.J., and Mr. Blinder, who grew up in New York City, were in different classes at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Mr. Belle, who had come from Cardiff, Wales, by way of London, was working for Jose Luis Sert, an architect, planner and dean of the Harvard design school.
When Le Corbusier came to Harvard in 1960 to unveil his design for the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, Beyer and Blinder and Belle attended the event, having no idea at the time -- as they nibbled cookies baked in the shape of Corbusier's "Modulor" man icon -- that they were standing in the same room as their future partners.
They did not get to know one another until the mid-60's, when all three worked in the New York office of Victor Gruen. It was then that they felt the tension between their instincts and those of their colleagues. "A lot of the profession was going in the direction of urban removal," Mr. Belle said.
SO they set up shop on their own at 31 Union Square West. "We weren't in the mainstream," Mr. Beyer said. "We were doing nitty-gritty stuff in the Bronx," like the 1,000-unit Jose de Diego-Beekman Houses in the Mott Haven section.
"We certainly didn't burst on the scene," Mr. Blinder allowed. "We grew and evolved." One early client, Robert Bonham, was a developer of low-income co-ops in the Bronx who went on to become the president of the South Street Seaport Museum. Through their planning and design work at South Street, the partners got to know Mr. Fitch, whom they invited to join the firm when he retired from Columbia University.
"That was our bridge to Ellis Island," Mr. Blinder said of Mr. Fitch, who gave the firm the needed credibility to pursue that commission. The $25 million renovation and restoration of Ellis Island as the National Museum of Immigration, undertaken with Notter Finegold & Alexander, put Beyer Blinder Belle squarely on the map.
Ellis Island was one of several factors weighed by the M.T.A. selection committee that was looking for architects to replan Grand Central. "The terminal needed to be preserved and restored but it also needed to be changed a bit," said Peter E. Stangl, the former chairman of the M.T.A. "John Belle shared that vision, even though he has strong preservation principles."
The most controversial aspect of the project was the decision to build an entirely new staircase on the east side of the concourse, balancing that on the Vanderbilt Avenue side. "That was kind of shocking to the traditionalists," Mr. Stangl conceded.
But not to Mr. Fitch. "The logic of the plan suggested that there would have been a balancing stair there," he said. "That's the essence of Beaux-Arts philosophy. We found working drawings that showed that a staircase could be put in. We found steel connections all prepared for the stair."
At the age of 89, Mr. Fitch retired last month from active practice. He was succeeded in the partnership by James W. Rhodes, 52, who was named on Tuesday. The other partners are Douglas McR. McKean, 42, and Richard Metsky, 40. Marilyn Marullo, 46, is the administrative officer, a position equivalent to partner.
Altogether, eight partners and two associate partners own a stake in the firm, whose gross annual billings amount to $15.5 million. There are about 100 employees. In the latest ranking, Beyer Blinder Belle was the 18th largest firm in the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects.
From a peak of 150 employees in the mid-80's, the firm shrank to fewer than 50 during the depth of the recession in the early 90's.
"We kept most of our senior staff," Ms. Marullo said, "although we had them working on the boards." Those who remained took pay cuts. The firm depended on public works and other "bread-and-butter" projects, said Maxinne Rhea Leighton, the managing director of business development.
Only six blocks from its original home, Beyer Blinder Belle occupies the second floor of a loft building at 11th Street and University Place. A 60-foot-long display wall bisects the space at a 45-degree angle, leading to the "crit pit," a large room where wide-ranging critiques occur almost every Tuesday morning over breakfast.
Its partners take pride in being more New York-oriented than many of their competitors. "They say they're on their way to Kuala Lumpur," Mr. Belle noted, "and we're on our way to the Bronx."
"I'm going through subway cards like crazy," Mr. Blinder added.
But the firm's national profile will surely grow. One project on the drawing boards involves the potential recreation of Thomas U. Walter's original 1859 design for the United States Senate Chamber.
The firm is active in planning, renovating private homes and corporate interiors. It is also cultivating business in new construction, Mr. McKean said, on the grounds that "we know how buildings are put together."
"The lack of a signature style has its liabilities and strengths," Mr. Metsky said. "It may be a liability in getting a commission for a new building. But the strength is in our ability to group together to solve complex problems. A non-signature building doesn't have to be done by one hand."
Rather than being divided among specialists, projects are given to teams of generalists who follow the work from the earliest sketches to the last punch list. The advantage is that even junior architects can gain broad experience. The disadvantage is the potential for burnout, particularly on jobs like Grand Central that go on for years.
No one is expecting Beyer or Blinder or Belle to burn out anytime soon. "As long as they want to practice architecture, it's open to them," Mr. McKean said, adding that the name of the firm will not change.
As to the future, Mr. Belle looks forward to standing in a completed Grand Central and overhearing one commuter ask another: "Doesn't the east staircase look better now that it's been restored?"

Does Anybody Have Room for One or Two More Hot Dogs?

 BODY:
The Chatter column on May 24 asked readers to share their favorite places to get hot dogs. Here are some of the responses: 
 My husband and I are originally from Passaic. About 26 years ago, we were in Israel on a tour. We met another young couple from Chicago; the husband was originally from Clifton.
When his wife found out we were from Passaic she became very excited. During a stop somewhere in the desert, she said: "I just want to know. Are the hot dogs at Rutt's as good as he tells me?"
I have no doubt that Rutt's hot dogs are known throughout the civilized world, having been spoken of by two generations who grew up going there for hot dogs and onion rings after innumerable high school basketball games.
 
MIRIAM PICKETT

There is no better place for a "ripper" than Rutt's Hutt in Clifton. This place has been serving hot dogs and birch beer for over 60 years. Oh yeah, how about the onion rings?
 
BILL RACHLES

 Stewarts, whose headquarters are in New Jersey, surely boasts the best of hot dogs, especially when accompanied by the old-fashioned frosted mug of root beer. Eating one (or two) of these franks, served by the carhop is not only delicious, but also conjures up lots of fond memories of high school dates when the thing to do was "pull in for a dog and a mug."

Since I moved to New Jersey 30 years ago, I've been getting my hot dogs (and cheeseburgers and steak sandwiches) at the Anthony Wayne Charcoal Ovens on Route 46 in Wayne. Not only are the hot dogs great (everything cooked on that grill has a distinct, charcoal-broiled flavor and aroma you don't find anywhere else), but the atmosphere is unique. It's filled with antiques, including a beautiful grandfather's clock that works, and has an outdoor brick patio and great lawn with old flowering trees.
Mentioning the place would have added another dimension to your coverage of the "typical" hot dog stand. The place has been there for about 40 years. I understand it was the first establishment on that stretch of the highway, surrounded only by woods. It has a clientele of transients and locals dating from from the day it opened: regular travelers passing through to and from vacation homes, boomers who took their wives there after the prom and a whole new crowd of young adults.

George Petritis sold Sabrett's hot dogs and Yoo- Hoo out of a hot dog truck outside the DeWitt Theater in Bayonne for umpteen years. Moviegoers were gifted with a double header: a good movie and hot dogs at Petritis. The theater made way for progress: a McDonalds. What else? George didn't give up, however. He opened a store directly across the street, and continued his tradition, much to the love and enjoyment of the citizens of Bayonne!

KATHLEEN PACHECO

Once upon a time, during the summer of 1945, two 15-year-old kids who would later become my parents met because of a hot dog.
My mother was vacationing at Loch Arbour with her parents, and my dad was working in one of the hotels. One day, on his time off, he decided to go down to the beach. Being a growing boy, he was also hungry. Ah, he thought, a hot dog would be just the thing. He spied a hot dog stand and took his place in line. As he looked up, though, the end of a delicious-looking wiener was staring him in the face, held up by the backward-facing hand of a shapely young girl. Having an eye for the ladies as well as the dogs, and desirous of making the girl's acquaintance, he took a large bite out of the hot dog. When the girl finished paying for her snack, she whirled around to see a red-faced boy with a very full mouth.
By the time she had finished yelling at him, he had recovered enough to offer to buy her another hot dog, and incidentally invited her to share the beach with him. The rest, as they say, is history. . . .

I married young. We had no money, and I couldn't cook. Enter the delicious, economical hot dog. Boil water. Drop hot dogs in. Presto, dinner is served. I still love a good hot dog. But now with more jingle in my pocket, I let Nathan's do the cooking.

 Proust had his madeleines, I have my hot dogs. I am descended from a long line of hot dog lovers. As a child in the 50's I remember Grandma Fanny favoring a road house called the Denville Shack, a frequent stop on our Sunday drives. By my college years, I officially welcomed spring by picking up Grandpa Eddie at his hangout in the park and driving to the Galloping Hills Caterers in Union for the first delicious dogs of the year.
 
JUDY HORWITZ WOLFF

Boy, your topic brought back some fond memories. On St. George's Avenue in Linden there was a place called George's over 20 years. ago. There you got one of the best hot dogs and malted shakes around.
 
DEE HICKMAN
Hillsborough
Our favorite hot dog joint is not a joint. Great-tasting frankfurters (as they call them). It's the Anthony Wayne on Route 46 in Wayne. If you go, you must eat on the patio and try some of their homemade relish. Perfect.
 
SHIRLEY COCHRAN

Gone are the Needic's, Sid's and Millman's. Now out in the country the closest hot dog place to these is Hot Dog Johnny's in Butzville. Great dogs, fries and birch beer in frosted mugs.
 
BARRY VERBEL
Flanders
 Over 25 years ago my Dad took me to this hot dog place in Orange, Jimmy Buffs. I could barely see over the counter and the place was always crowded. They had the best Italian style hot dogs with the peppers and potatos smothered in ketchup.
Today, Jimmy Buff's is still there and serving the best dogs in Jersey. I always stop in when I go to my mother's to visit. You don't know good dogs until you hit the Buff's. Da Best!!!
 
VINCENT A. D'ANTONIO Sr.

And for the New Jersey section's very last word on hot dogs, here are some etiquette tips from the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council.
Don't put hot dog toppings between the hot dog and the bun. Always "dress the dog," not the bun.
Do use paper plates to serve hot dogs. Everyday dishes are acceptable; china is a no-no.
Don't bring wine to a hot dog barbecue. Beer, soda, lemonade and iced tea are preferable.

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
The Threatened Bells of St. Martin's

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
AT St. Martin's Episcopal Church on 230 Malcolm X Boulevard, at West 122d Street, the tintinnabulation of the bells, bells, bells is unusual, joyful -- and threatened.
Unlike bells that are played by pulling on a long rope, St. Martin's are arranged in an elaborate series of wires and levers known as a carillon. Played on a special keyboard, a carillon is one of music's grandest, rarest and most challenging percussive instruments, producing harmonies that, of course, are impossible on a single large bell. 
 St. Martin's is one of perhaps 250 carillons in churches, colleges and public buildings nationwide and one of two in New York City. The other, at Riverside Church in Morningside Heights, is much larger. St. Martin's carillon was built to celebrate the restoration of St. Martin's after a 1939 fire that almost destroyed the building.
But St. Martin's congregation, never huge and never rich, is shrinking and getting poorer, and its carillon has become increasingly dilapidated. Now, preservationist groups say, it needs hundreds of thousands of dollars in repairs, and the leaky tower that houses it also needs to be fixed.
Money is not the church's only problem. Even if St. Martin's can raise the cash needed for the carillon, it still needs to find someone to play it. Carillonneurs are even rarer than carillons: there are perhaps 75 in the United States, only 5 of them full-time professionals, according to the Guild of Carillonneurs in North America.
The instrument requires a player with finesse and raw strength. Next to no one is trained to teach it, so few music students have ever heard of it.
What's more, St. Martin's is in Harlem, where church music often means gospel. Black publications sometimes refer to St. Martin's carillon as "a cultural contradiction," an allusion to carilloning's roots in Europe and black churches' traditional commitment to the poor.
"Why not build soup kitchens instead of bringing in the bells, some have asked," said the Rev. David Johnson, 70, the senior minister and the eldest son of the founder, John H. Johnson. "But 'you must feed the soul as well as the body' is my reply."
Linda J. Herd, a private citizen who developed an interest in the church, hopes to nourish the soul and the carillon with a festival she has organized next Sunday. Up to five guest carillonneurs will play half-hour recitals, starting at noon. Ms. Herd said the church hoped to attract young people to a future instruction program for carillonneurs, much like the famed stone-carving program at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, and to entice benefactors to pay for repairs.
Joel M. Goldfrank, 50, a private investor on the Upper East Side who has agreed to provide a large portion of the estimated $156,000 needed to repair the bells, said he hoped to raise the rest of the money from city agencies and private contributors.
"When a church bell rings, it, at least subliminally, reminds people of their neighborhood," Mr. Goldfrank said. "In a city as sprawling and busy as New York, bells would make life more livable."
But the carillon repairs hinge on repairs to the 90-foot tower that houses it. With the help of Cityscape Institute, a nonprofit urban planning group, the church has applied for a $175,000 grant from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, a Federal economic development program. The zone is expected to rule on the grant this summer.
"The tower is in a state of serious deterioration," said Ken Lustbader, director of the sacred sites program of the Landmarks Conservancy, the group that helped assess the damage to St. Martin's tower. "Water is leaking, the copper shielding is falling off and the masonry -- the bricks themselves -- need urgent replacement," he said.
That there is a carillon in Harlem at all is quite a feat. Unlike Riverside Church's carillon, which at 74 bells is the world's largest, St. Martin's 42-bell carillon was not a gift of John D. Rockefeller Jr. After the 1939 electrical fire left only the shell of the Romanesque Revival building, the 3,500-member congregation struggled to rebuild.
A parishioner, Arnold Rosey, originally from the West Indies, where church bells are common, gave $100 to the pastor, Mr. Johnson, specifically for a fund to buy a bell. Word spread and parishioners -- working-class men and women like laborers, hospital attendants and maids, most of them also from the West Indies -- contributed $2,000. Mr. Johnson and others decided on a carillon from the renowned Royal Bell Casting Foundry, in Heiligerlee in the Netherlands.
In two years, the congregation raised the then extraordinary sum of $45,000, and the bells were installed in 1949. For many in the congregation, however, the real climax arrived when Queen Juliana of the Netherlands came to see the bells in 1952, thronged by more than 7,000 Harlem well-wishers.
But Harlem was changing after World War II. Prosperous families began moving to Brooklyn and the Bronx. Today, there are fewer than 700 congregants at St. Martin's, and more than two-thirds live outside Harlem, said the Rev. David Johnson. As with other century-old churches (St. Martin's was built in 1887) and synagogues, deferred maintenance has often been the order of the day.
Still, St. Martin's paid attention to its bells. In 1962, the congregation sent its young carillonneur, Dionisio Lind, to learn more about the difficult art at a six-month carillon program in Belgium. Mr. Lind, now 67, plays with the verve of the accomplished carillonneur. To the outsider, it appears he is pulling off a strange combination of playing the organ and a game of handball.
Like other carillonneurs, Mr. Lind displays the four-limbed mania of the organ player, playing the keyboard, or clavier, with his hands and stomping down on foot pedals. But instead of playing a piano-like set of keys, he lifts and pushes down on a series of knobs known as batons. The batons and foot pedals are connected to the bells by wires. The heavier the bells, the more Mr. Lind has to lift and push.
The heaviest bells range from 1,150 to 3,100 pounds. Using balled fists to snap down on the batons that control them has raised heavy calluses on Mr. Lind's hands; without them, his hands would bleed.
St. Martin's strained finances have also taken their toll. Until retiring recently, Mr. Lind was a production manager at a nonprofit training group for the disabled. He played the carillon on Sundays and other occasions for a $25 fee, far less than the $200 or more that carillonneurs usually earn. Last year, when Riverside Church's carillonneur was on a sabbatical leave, Mr. Lind filled in at that church's far more celebrated carillon.
"Best thing that ever happened to me," Mr. Lind said, explaining that the church and Mr. Johnson "realized what they were missing, and they began to respect me more." Asked for a response, Mr. Johnson said, "Say I just smiled." Mr. Lind plans to play next Sunday and, as one of the country's senior carillonneurs, would be instrumental in any future instructional program.
"We are determined that there will be a future for these bells," Mr. Johnson said. "They are a cultural gold mine, like a painting. But what is most inspiring is that this is a painting paid for by poor people's money. They are poor people's bells."

Diagram: "WORK ORDER: Fixing the Bells"
Like other carillons, the one at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Harlem consists of a keyboard, or clavier, and an array of bells. The bells weigh from 20 to 3,100 pounds and are in good shape. But the wire system that manipulates the bells has rusted, loosened or otherwise been damaged since the carillon was installed in 1949, especially because of water leakage in the bell tower itself.
 
Here are the most urgent repairs:
 
1. Replace entire clavier, where carillonneur presses down on a manual lever or pedal.
 
2. Install new parts, like the umbrella system, that pull the transmission wire down, causing the transmission bar to rotate, which pulls the clapper, striking the bell.
 
3. Install new coil springs, and other parts, for tension control.
 
Also install a pratice clavier, so carillonneur can play without ringing bells.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Oil Can't Salve Russia's Wounds

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
POLITICAL gyrations, economic turmoil, crashing stock markets, embattled currency, collapsing tax revenue. In such troubled times, Russia might be forgiven for leaning hard on the one thing it can count on: oil and natural gas exports, paid for in dollars. Some investors worry that a sorely pressed Government might flood the already glutted world oil market and depress prices further.
So why doesn't Moscow just turn up the spigot to solve its economic and financial problems? 
 "They wish they could, but they can't," said Ann-Louise Hittle, who follows oil markets as a director of Cambridge Energy Associates, a consulting group in Boston. "They're producing as much as they can."
Far from ramping up production, the Russian oil industry has had to cut output by about 60,000 barrels a day because low prices -- about $11 a barrel for Russian exports, down from $18 a year ago -- and high production costs have made some wells uneconomical, Ms. Hittle said.
Russia is one of the world's leading oil exporters, with a big domestic industry and vast reserves, and it has a long history of using its output for its own political and economic purposes, ignoring the efforts of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- of which it is not a member -- to manage world supplies.
Now, though, Russia's ability to squeeze more income from oil depends on whether OPEC can agree to raise prices by cutting production at its mext meeting, later this month in Vienna. Russia plans to send a representative to the meeting, and is considering joining OPEC.
In advance of the meeting, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela agreed on Thursday with Mexico, which is not a member, to cut their production by 450,000 barrels a day. Those three nations led a coalition that managed to win agreement for production cuts last March, temporarily buoying prices.
But Russia's Energy Minister, Sergei Generalov, has said Russia cannot help OPEC by making further cuts of its own.
Instead, to raise cash, the Government has sought to privatize some of the industry. But prices for domestic oil companies proved just as disappointing as the price of oil. The Government tried to get $2.1 billion for RAO Rosneft, a huge energy company, but found no interested buyers; it recently had to drop the asking price to $1.6 billion to attract bids.
Russian oil industry executives, who were flexing political muscles at home and in neighboring nations a year or two ago when oil fetched $18 to $20 a barrel, are on the defensive, pleading for Government help with tax cuts and lower pipeline fees.
They are in a bind. Antiquated equipment at the wellhead makes trimming production a one-way proposition at many wells; once they are shut down, it would be very expensive to restart them. But at current oil prices, many of the same wells lose money on every barrel.
Unless OPEC and other major producers can agree to make another production cut, like one agreed upon in March, many analysts say oil prices may fall further, adding to the burdens of the economy. Russia exports about 25 percent of its output of about 6.2 million barrels a day, yielding 45 percent of the country's foreign-currency income. Production peaked in 1988, when most Eastern European countries were still captive customers, at 11.4 million barrels a day, but in the collapse of Communism the next year, output fell by nearly half.
Domestic energy prices in Russia are still somewhat shielded from world market trends, so the Russian oil industry has begun looking more toward domestic markets to help ride out the downturn. But ruble sales don't help refill Government coffers with hard currency.
Robert Ebel, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research group in Washington, said Russian production increased slightly last year, mostly because of increasing investment by Western oil companies. But a lack of legal guarantees for foreigners has restricted the amounts that Western companies have been willing to commit to expand production further.
"It's unlikely that oil production in Russia will increase noticeably over the near term," Mr. Ebel said. "They have to make it attractive for Western companies to come in and invest." And without such investment, he said: "Russia is just about at its limit of what it can export. The pipelines are basically full."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT/EARNING IT;
Subjects Uneasy as a Benevolent Reign Ends

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: SKOKIE, Ill.

 BODY:
FOR 80 years, workers at Fel-Pro Inc., a manufacturer of automotive parts based here, have enjoyed some of the lushest benefits in corporate America.
The list is long and varied: as much as 12 weeks of vacation; scholarships; summer camp for employees' children; a fitness center; tutoring; the state's first licensed day-care center; use of a 250-acre corporate retreat, and even a $1,000 savings bond for the birth of an employee's child. 
 Not to mention solid health, pension and profit-sharing plans and a pro-nepotism policy that has meant that two-thirds of the 1,900 employees at the company's headquarters plant have had relatives on the payroll at one time or another. Or such gestures as a ham at Easter, a turkey at Christmas and candy for Valentine's Day. Even the employees' neighborhoods benefit: groups in which workers volunteer receive grants.
Pay averages $12.50 an hour, what the company calls "very competitive" wages for the industry, and workers receive an extra day's pay on their employment anniversary and birthday. And any threat to job security has been largely eliminated by a sizable temporary staff, which acts as a cushion to slack periods. Small wonder, then, that in a review by Fortune magazine last year of the nation's 100 best companies to work for, Fel-Pro ranked fourth.
"They coddled and spoiled us," acknowledged David Beller, a tool-and-die maker who has worked at Fel-Pro for 20 years. "They were very generous to their employees."
But circumstances have changed, as Mr. Beller's use of the past tense implies. Last December, the owners -- members of the Lehman, Weinberg and Morris families, descendants of the company's founder, Albert Mecklenburger -- said they intended to sell Fel-Pro. In January, word came of a takeover by the Federal-Mogul Corporation, a gritty Michigan company four times Fel-Pro's size.
In the months since, a large cloud has, not surprisingly, formed over this workers' paradise as employees confront the inevitable unease and search for reassurance about their prospects under a traditional corporate regime and its emphasis on maximizing profits.
"Everybody's nervous," said Lucy King, 34, a longtime employee in the packaging operations. "We really don't know what to expect. It's scary."
The skittishness is widespread -- and magnified by the jarringly quick dispatch of a few dozen marketing, accounting and other support people to Federal-Mogul's headquarters in Southfield, Mich., or to unemployment lines. Indeed, several people who initially agreed to be photographed for this article subsequently declined, saying they felt uncomfortable in the current corporate environment.
It is fair to say that such feelings are new to the factory here. Fel-Pro began in 1918 as Felt Products, which made a horse blanket that fit under saddles before felt was widely used as a sealant in automotive parts like gaskets. Over time, corporate policy that may have begun as benevolence grew to become a way of business that the company's fans say was as resolutely focused on the bottom line as any leaner-and-meaner approach.
"The benefits paid for themselves, with additional cooperation, higher productivity," said Robert O'Keefe, a retired vice president for industrial relations. "We used to say we couldn't not do it because it was an enhancement to our profits."
Workers take some comfort in various provisions of the $720 million stock-and-cash deal that the Fel-Pro families negotiated with Richard A. Snell, the chairman of Federal-Mogul. Under the agreement, various benefits will be maintained for specified periods while others will be replaced by those of the new parent.
Indeed, Mr. Snell said recently that "the first agenda item" in negotiations with the families was Fel-Pro's special corporate culture of near womb-to-tomb beneficence.
STILL, interviews with employees here found considerable skepticism about how they will fare. They know that even as Federal-Mogul tries to accommodate Fel-Pro, it is also digesting a much larger acquisition of a British automotive supplier, T & N P.L.C.
Generally, workers seemed resigned to losing most of the lesser fringe benefits while hoping for the best on vital interests like health insurance -- and keeping their jobs.
"You can never say with a big company like Federal-Mogul," said Frank Donis, 26, who works in the paper unit and whose mother, sister and an aunt all worked for Fel-Pro. "If things go down, the company's going to have to make adjustments."
One source of unease is Mr. Snell's intention to build what he calls an "all-star" team drawn from the top talent in the company; that is, Federal-Mogul will identify its best workers and protect them from layoffs. But job losses are coming: Federal-Mogul hopes to shrink its worldwide payroll of 41,000 by about 10 percent, much of it through attrition. The company has not, however, specified Fel-Pro's share of the pain.
Another unwelcome change: Kenneth A. Lehman, who served seven years in various Peace Corps positions before joining the family business and rising to co-chairman, will not join the Federal-Mogul board, as intended when the deal was announced. The reason, Mr. Lehman said, is that it might have presented a conflict: he is administrator of family trusts, and being a board member could, for example, inhibit sales by the trusts of Federal-Mogul shares because of his status as a company insider.
"They've got a big challenge on their plates," Mr. Lehman said in an interview the week after the deal closed in late February, referring to Federal-Mogul management. "They will be trying to forge a new culture for a big new global company."
Sounding not entirely confident, Mr. Lehman added that if Federal-Mogul was convinced that treating employees well improved the bottom line, "then hopefully they'll use us as a model."
That is not at all certain, judging from what typically occurs in such situations, said Jim Sillery, senior consultant at Watson Wyatt Worldwide in Chicago.
"The culture of the acquirer tends to become dominant," he said. "Fel-Pro's benefits will begin to look a lot like Mogul's," he predicted, noting that agreements covering benefits were not necessarily binding and were subject to interpretation.
Jonathan Weatherly, a consultant at Towers Perrin in Chicago, agreed. In the face of "overriding" pressure from auto makers on suppliers to squeeze costs, Mr. Weatherly said, "it really is hard to see all the nice features of the Fel-Pro culture surviving."
 As it stands now, Fel-Pro workers' profit-sharing plans can be rolled over into Federal-Mogul's 401(k) plan; medical and dental coverage converts to Federal-Mogul's similar, and in some respects better, plan in 1999. The summer day camp and wellness center will remain for at least two years, and vacations will be capped at four weeks, except for employees already entitled to more time.
The Fel-Pro families have set aside proceeds from the sale to maintain the scholarship program for five years.
One clear plus, however, is that Federal-Mogul hopes to extend its year-old stock option plan to Fel-Pro employees. The Federal-Mogul board is expected to approve the move within weeks.
Another, some employees say, is expanded opportunity as part of a $5 billion company. "Maybe all the benefits aren't there, but you can maybe get a job somewhere else in the country," said Larry Jenrich, 35, an inventory analyst in the distribution center for whom Fel-Pro paid for two years of college.
But benefits not already enjoyed by other Federal-Mogul workers seem jeopardized in the long run.
Roderick M. Hills, a longtime director of Federal-Mogul, said any loss would be minimal.
"We are hoping the Fel-Pro people will have as much impact on Federal-Mogul as vice versa," he said. "But you can't take the best of everything and spread it to everybody."

HEADLINE: Summertime, and the Driving Is Breezy

BYLINE: Contributing to this report were Michelle Krebs, James G. Cobb, Peter Passell, Fred Brock and Keith Martin.

 BODY:
SUMMER is around the corner, and the forecast, thanks to El Nino, is for a dry, sunny season -- ideal conditions for open-air motoring.
Some three dozen open-top car models are currently available in the United States, at prices of $20,000 to $350,000. And while low-end models continue to fade away for lack of interest -- the Honda Civic del Sol and Toyota Paseo are among this year's casualties -- fancy droptops are being added. Among these are the Volvo C70, which goes on sale next month, and the Mercedes-Benz CLK Cabriolet, due this fall. 
 Here is a rundown of the topless cars on sale this summer, excluding a number of sport utility vehicles -- like the Chevrolet Tracker, Isuzu Amigo, Jeep Wrangler, Kia Sportage and Suzuki Vitara -- that also have roofs that come down or come off. Prices are for base models; luxury and gas-guzzler taxes are not included.
 
ACURA NSX-T $88,782. Mid-engine, rear drive; 2 seats.
The NSX-T is lightning-quick, thanks to its very light aluminum body, its wind-slicing profile and its V6 engines that use Formula One racing technology. Indeed, since it is built to Honda's exacting standards, the NSX has been criticized for being too perfect -- a trouble-free appliance that thinks it's a Ferrari. Still, it is a pleasant and reliable exotic car that can be driven every day.
 
ASTON MARTIN DB7 Volante, $141,600. Front engine, rear drive; 4 seats.
The DB7's road manners cannot be faulted, and the supercharged V8 is capable of pushing the two-ton grand touring car from zero to 60 in a mere 6 seconds. But what really separates this elite convertible from the pack is aesthetics: the lithe swoop of the fenders, the mirror-like paint job, the aromatic leather, the faultless walnut trim. Too bad the DB7 costs twice as much as the rather similar Jaguar XK8.
 
AUDI CABRIOLET $35,100. Premium, $38,800. Front engine, front drive; 4 seats.
Its superclean styling still looks fresh, but the Cabriolet is the last of the previous-generation cars in Audi's lineup. Because its V6 doesn't meet stricter pollution standards, the '98 is not available in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts or New York.
 
BENTLEY AZURE $339,900. Front engine, rear drive; 4 seats.
All you really need to know about the Azure is its price. With only 93 sold last year, you'll surely have the only one on the block. It will get you a good table at Spago and will win you respect from Hollywood's toughest critics: valet parking attendants.
 
BMW 3-SERIES 323i, $34,700; 328i, $41,500; M3, $45,900. Front engine, rear drive 4 seats.
In all of its many body and drive-train configurations, the 3-Series was a benchmark when it was remade for 1992, and it remains one of the world's most pleasurable cars for everyday driving. Exceptionally rigid for a convertible, it handles brilliantly. New this year is the 6-cylinder 323i, which replaces the 4-cylinder 318i, and a convertible version of the legendary, high-performance M3.
 
BMW Z3 1.9, $29,995; 2.8, $36,470. M Roadster, $42,770. Front engine, rear drive; 2 seats.
The M Roadster promises a high-octane fix for the Z3's shortcomings. For while the voluptuous body grabs attention, the car's performance hasn't matched its appearance -- especially the wimpy, buzzy 4-cylinder 1.8. And the Z3, built in South Carolina, lacks BMW's usual refinement.
 
CHEVROLET CAVALIER Z24 $19,910. Front engine, front drive; 4 seats.
A small package with reasonable accommodations for at least two people and some luggage, the Cavalier has a family resemblance to its big brother, the Camaro. The interior is attractive and functional, although the hard, unsupportive seats make long trips unpleasant. The 4-cylinder engine is adequate, and the handling is good.
 
CHEVROLET CAMARO V6, $22,650; Z28, $27,975. Front engine, rear drive; 4 seats.
The venerable Camaro and its Pontiac counterpart, the Firebird, may be living on borrowed time. The 30-year-old muscle car formula -- raw power, reasonable price -- has lost its magic in an era of high insurance rates and sport-utility mania. The Camaro still performs, but it feels dated.
 
CHEVROLET CORVETTE $44,990. Front engine, rear drive; 2 seats.
The classic nameplate was saved from General Motors' budget cutters to be reborn as the best 'Vette ever. While some aficionados dislike styling touches seemingly borrowed from Acura, there is little grousing about the performance of the 345-horsepower V8 -- or about the newly accommodating interior and a trunk that can hold golf bags.
 
CHRYSLER SEBRING JX, $21,235; JXi, $26,500. Front engine, front drive; 4 seats.
America's best-selling convertible is built in Mexico and has little in common with the Mitsubishi-built coupe of the same name. Spacious, stylish and comfortable, the Sebring offers good value. It also has a rarity among convertibles: a back seat big enough for two adults. But order the JXi V6; the 4-cylinder JX is overwhelmed.
 
DODGE VIPER RT/10 $64,700. Front engine, rear drive; 2 seats.
Only in America! No other country could produce such a bold, aggressive, over-the-top car -- the whopping 8-liter V10 engine produces an awesome 450 horsepower. But the performance is American-brutal, not European-refined.
 
FERRARI F355 SPIDER $138,115. Front engine, rear drive; 2 seats.
Ferrari's V12's get the attention, but for enduring driving pleasure it's hard to beat the smaller, lighter F355, with its V8 just in front of the rear wheels. Like all Ferraris, this one requires getting used to. The manual gearbox is balky; the cockpit is cramped for 6-footers. And judged purely by the numbers, it performs no better than a Porsche or Corvette. But for those hooked on the wheel's rock-solid feel and the engine's sensual howl, there is no substitute.
 
FORD MUSTANG $21,175; GT, $24,675; Cobra, $29,035. Front engine, rear drive; 4 seats.
The original pony car will be revamped next year, and it may eventually stand alone in this shrinking market. Still, the Mustang has enjoyed a slight resurgence in sales, and it comes in versions from plain (3.8-liter V6) to muscular (4.6-liter V8). Each offers a lot of performance for the price.
 
JAGUAR XK8 $70,480. Front engine, rear drive; 4 seats.
With its lean body, ground-hugging profile and long hood, the XK8 is, quite simply, a ravishing beauty. Inside, the sumptuous cabin sets standards. And the 4-liter, 290-horsepower V8 is smooth and powerful. Except for the price, what's not to like?
 
LAMBORGHINI DIABLO ROADSTER VT $284,000. Mid-engine, all-wheel drive; 2 seats.
The wedge silhouette, angular lines and side air intakes give the Diablo the aggressive look of a Formula One race car, and with a 492-horsepower V12 it nearly performs like one. Alas, with a price so high, few will ever have the experience.
 
MAZDA MX-5 MIATA $20,220. Front engine, rear drive; 2 seats.
The first Miata revived the moribund roadster market, and its many fans held their breath when Mazda announced a redesign. They're breathing easier now, because the qualities that made the car shine -- its light weight, its agility, the growl of its eager 4-cylinder engine -- have been made better. The styling remains simple and timeless, and there is 140 horsepower, up from 133. So nimble it feels like an extension of the driver, the Miata may offer more fun per dollar than anything else on the road.
 
MERCEDES-BENZ SLK230 $40,295. Front engine, rear drive; 2 seats.
Quiet and weatherproof, with a hard top that draws a crowd when it retracts into the trunk, the SLK pleases baby boomers nostalgic for the SL roadsters of the 50's. The interior is packed with retro touches like white gauges trimmed in chrome. The supercharged 4-cylinder is economical and fairly peppy, but the overall effect is more luxurious than sporty.
 
MERCEDES-BENZ SL SL500, $80,495; SL600, $125,595. Front engine, rear drive; 2 seats.
Along with the S-Class sedans, which will be replaced next year, the SL roadsters are the last remnants of the "old" Mercedes-Benz: very expensive, very solid and just a bit uptight, without the youthful feel of newer Mercedes models or the glamour of, say, an XK8. Still, SL's are extremely refined, technologically advanced and socially impressive. No wonder movie stars drive them.
 
MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE SPYDER GS, $21,850; GS-T, $27,080. Front engine, front drive; 4 seats.
A car long on pizazz but short on practicality, the Spyder has a futuristic look and, with the GS-T's turbo version of the in-line 4-cylinder, spirited performance. Indeed, with so much power running through the front wheels, the driver must pay attention to keep the car on track. The back seat is not just tight -- it is virtually unusable.
 
PLYMOUTH PROWLER $40,000. Front engine, rear drive; 2 seats.
If you want to see and be seen, hardly anything gets more stares than this nouveau street rod. The Prowler could scarcely be more impractical -- there's no place to put anything -- and the standard-issue V6 is nothing special. But the Prowler is built for cruising, not commuting.
 
PONTIAC SUNFIRE SE, $19,995. Front engine, front drive; 4 seats.
The Sunfire packs the flashy styling and gutsy performance of Pontiac's larger cars into a small, reasonably priced package. Although it is a near-twin of the Chevy Cavalier, the Sunfire's look is inspired by the Firebird. The ride is characteristically Pontiac: firm, but not stiff.
 
PONTIAC FIREBIRD $24,830; Trans Am, $30,240. Front engine, rear drive; 4 seats.
Like their Camaro counterparts, Pontiac's pony cars offer power and performance at an attractive price. But the Firebird goes further, with bold, outrageous styling. Like the Camaro, the car has a shrinking market, and its future is uncertain.
 
PORSCHE BOXSTER $41,765. Mid-engine, rear drive; 2 seats.
The Boxster's proportions and bulging fenders mimic Porsches of the past, but many of the touches -- like fan-shaped mirrors and cat's-eye buttons -- are thoroughly modern. No speed demon, the Boxster offers a nearly perfect balance of power and knife-sharp handling. It is a joy to drive at any speed.
 
PORSCHE CARRERA CABRIOLET $81,745. Rear engine, rear drive; 2 seats.
Like the other all-new 911's, the Cabriolet is a rear-engine rocket ship that coddles occupants with luxury appointments and electronic gadgets. Space is well used, with rear jump seats that fold for more storage.
 
SAAB 9-3 $37,050; SE, $42,050. Front engine, front drive; 4 seats.
When the well-made, tight-fitting insulated top is up, it's easy to forget you're in a convertible, and two adults can fit reasonably well in the back. With Saab's traditional road-hugging qualities, the 1999 9-3 is fun to drive, and the 185-horsepower turbo-charged 4 has plenty of punch.
 
VOLKSWAGEN CABRIO $18,475; GLS, $22,790. Front engine, front drive; 4 seats.
A perennial favorite of young women, the Cabrio remains a fun and functional convertible -- and its back seat can actually accommodate passengers. But they'd better travel light: A picnic lunch is about all that will fit in the trunk. This is the last season for the current Cabrio; it gets a makeover before next summer.

VOLVO C70 $44,000 (estimated). Front engine, front drive; 4 seats.
Volvo's first convertible since 1956 goes on sale next month, and, no, it doesn't look like a box without a top. The styling is sleek and the appointments are elegant, but the C70 shows Volvo's usual attention to safety, including roll bars that pop up behind the rear headrests. The turbo 5-cylinder is spirited, but the car's handling is uninspired.

WHEN most companies go public, the aim is to recruit shareholders. Now, recruiters may be going public partly to help recruit recruiters.
Industry experts point to six executive search firms that are either planning or considering initial public offerings, including the two leaders, Heidrick & Struggles and Korn/Ferry International. Capital needs like new computer systems for sophisticated searches or a war chest for acquisitions are mentioned. 
 But rather than the cash the offerings raise, the most important payoff may be the ability to use lucrative stock option plans to lure top talent in an industry where compensation does not vary widely from one firm to another.
Whether that adds up to an attractive proposition for investors is an open question.
There is no doubt that the executive search business is booming, because of a strong economy and the great emphasis many corporations place on recruiting the most suitable executives for top posts rather than automatically promoting from within. Revenues of the top 10 firms in the field grew 23 percent last year, and half of them have seen revenue more than double over the past five years, according to Hunt-Scanlon Advisors, which publishes a newsletter called Executive Search Review.
Companies in similar businesses where the assets all go home at night -- like consulting, advertising and money management -- have gone public with some success. And the one major executive search company to follow their lead in recent years, LAI Ward Howell, has done well so far, rising from its offering price of $12 last July to $19.50 on Friday. (LAI filed plans in May for a secondary offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.)
But there are plenty of reasons for investors to look twice at executive search company stocks.
For one thing, Korn/Ferry went public once before, in 1972, and did not enjoy it. The company was small and the stock thinly traded and volatile; the founders, Lester B. Korn and Richard M. Ferry, found the bobbing of the stock price a maddening distraction. They repurchased all the stock in 1974 and went private again; their experience made others in the industry shy of public offerings for two decades.
Korn/Ferry is considering going public again now, said its president and chief executive, Michael Boxberger, because the company wants to expand its business to the Internet and finance growing technology needs. But Korn/Ferry also wants to use its stock to attract and retain staff.
Yet that objective can be a concern for investors, too. Executive search firms have high turnover rates, providing the potential to seriously burn investors if a firm is hit by a wave of defections.
And earnings can be difficult to forecast. "This is a very relationship-oriented business, and it often takes years to develop relationships with clients," said Susan Chadick, a partner at Gould, McCoy & Chadick, a small executive search firm in Manhattan. "Our product doesn't unfold on a predictable basis."
Ryan Jacob, an analyst at IPO Value Monitor, said: "Going public is a good move for the companies, but it has a certain degree of risk for investors. In most cases, these companies have fairly uneven operating results -- that's just the nature of the business."
That is probably because most firms in the industry are small, and as Korn/Ferry's 1970's sojourn illustrates, size is an important concern. Mr. Boxberger said his company is now big and global enough to make its earnings fairly predictable.
BY some measures, however, the executive search business remains a cottage industry, and one beset by worrisome trends under the surface. According to Scott A. Scanlon, editor in chief of Executive Search Review, many firms not only lack the financial and marketing capacity to be publicly-traded entities, but they also have poor training programs for new hires. "This is an industry that hasn't made an effort to attract young talent, but that could sorely use it," Mr. Scanlon said.
As a result, he said, it now takes the average recruiter longer to fill an assignment, and the number of successfully completed assignments is dropping.
For their part, executives at some of the largest search firms continue to resist the idea of going public. The recruiting concern Spencer Stuart recently lost two top executives to Heidrick & Struggles. But Joseph E. Griesedieck Jr., chief executive of Spencer Stuart, said the company's 115 partners voted unanimously last month to remain private, partly because of concerns over the potential loss of client confidentiality.
Still, there are signs that publicly traded search firms may have an edge on the recruitment front.
At Strategic Legal Resources, a Manhattan search company that places high-level executives as well as lawyers, Jay B. Horowitz, one of its founders, said stock options had definitely helped lure new employees since Strategic Legal was acquired earlier this year by Staffmark Inc., a publicly traded staffing company.
"These options have huge appeal. I can pay people one-half to two-thirds of the salaries they wanted," Mr. Horowitz said. "And that's because people feel like they're part of something in a publicly traded company."

Attack of the 20-Foot Rats

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
IT is a season of discontent, at least among those who make their living on the city's streets. And many have taken to those very streets to protest: taxi drivers, disgruntled sidewalk artists and, most recently, food cart vendors, all complaining of new municipal regulations that they say will hamper their business.
But these are battles between individual workers and their city. Where are the labor unions, whose collective organizing traditionally took place on the streets and sidewalks of New York? 
 "Don't worry, we're out there," said Mike Hellstrom, an organizer for Local 79 of the Construction and Building Laborers Union. "And these days we're taking a relentless approach that works."
Indeed, after many years of decline, grass-roots organizing is back in New York, as local labor leaders make it a priority again. And there is probably no better example than Mr. Hellstrom's union.
"Until a few years ago, there was a very complacent attitude," said Mr. Hellstrom, who has taken organizing courses at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. George Meany Center outside Washington, and at Cornell University. "Now you're seeing a much more aggressive attitude," one that he says has succeeded in winning union recognition at many construction sites across the city.
For about two years, his union has been sending its members to nonunion projects to demonstrate in the street. They whistle, chant and yell and, usually, they take along a 20-foot inflated rat to make their point. "He represents nonunion contractors," Mr. Hellstrom said of his whiskered companion.
Local 79's most recent protest took place on Thursday morning at a Metropolitan Transportation Authority project on Ninth Avenue and 54th Street. (Many government employers use contractors who pay the prevailing wage, but who are not required to hire union members.) Beginning about 6 A.M., hundreds of whistle-blowing union members blocked the street and tied up traffic. They also brought four of the towering rodents with them, for emphasis.
This return to "in your face" demonstrations, as Mr. Hellstrom calls them, is part of a national trend, said Joshua Freeman, a labor historian at Queens College. A few years ago, he explained, big labor realized "that standing still just wouldn't work" in the midst of politicians' consistent attacks on unions and growing antilabor sentiment. Still, it has taken New Yorkers longer to join the fray than it has others, precisely because New York is historically a union town.
Despite some erosion in its union membership, "New York was less hard hit by the general decline of labor than the rest of the country," Professor Freeman said. Organizing never petered out totally, but a bad local economy in the early 1990's, coupled with "less of a sense of emergency," made New York "slower to re-embrace it," he said. "But it's happening now."
Local labor officials agree. "Unions were acting like their only job was to take care of their existing members," said Bill Henning, vice president of Local 1180 of the Communications Workers of America, who added that labor used to "wait for the phone to ring" before organizing new members. That attitude has disappeared, he said; he and other union executives took a labor organizing course in March, and about 70 members of the local went on a retreat a few weeks ago to learn about organizing.
Similarly, Sylvia Grant, executive vice president of Local 1199 of the National Health and Human Services Employees Union, said that 20 rank-and-file members had recently taken leaves of absence from their jobs and were being trained to organize clinic workers. Already the largest union of health care workers in the city, the 120,000-member local merged early this year with the 1.2 million-member Service Employees International Union, based in Washington. The merged union has pledged to increase its organizing.
Of course union organizing never disappeared entirely from New York. But much of it was "waged silently," with the unions negotiating behind the scenes with employers, according to Brooks Bitterman, research director for Local 100 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union. But he said that his union had always believed in "taking street action."
"We've done lots of civil disobedience," Mr. Bitterman said. "Lots of leafleting, sit-down strikes and rallies."
Local 100 is the union that targeted the Box Tree, the elegant restaurant on East 49th Street that serves $86 prix-fixe dinners. The organizing effort dragged on for more than four years, until the workers were unionized in February.
The Box Tree campaign was "a real community battle," Mr. Bitterman said. The union enlisted local politicians in the cause and also publicized possible code violations by the restaurant, which the union claimed was running a hotel illegally.
Box Tree denied the claims, but merely raising them helped the organizers. "One of the things we have found is that there is a lot of potential support among elected officials and neighborhood groups if you know how to mobilize it," Mr. Bitterman said.
Of course there was constant picketing, too, and a coordinated effort by Local 100 to get prospective diners to choose other restaurants for their luxury meals. "If a restaurant worker engages customers in conversation, and explains what's going on, we find that they are generally supportive," Mr. Bitterman said. "It's so easy for them to avoid the aggravation of crossing a picket line and to go somewhere else, especially with so many restaurants in New York."
But are the tactics of confrontation effective generally? Mr. Hellstrom thinks so, and plans to continue them, he said. Among other successes, he cited 25 weeks worth of demonstrations that resulted in a union contract for workers renovating a 24-story office building on John Street. He said there had been an increase of 5,000 members in his local in the two years since the on-the-street, rat-accompanied protests began.
Mr. Bitterman will also persist in such tactics, like the picketing since early spring at Angelo and Maxie's Steakhouse on Park Avenue South and 19th Street, a spot frequented by professional athletes.
He also pointed to the recent unionization of cafeteria workers at the headquarters of Salomon Smith Barney on Greenwich Street in lower Manhattan. The strategy there, he said, included sit-ins (complete with arrests last November), picketing and even an alliance with women's groups to publicize reported acts of sexual harassment and discrimination by various firm employees.
Salomon Smith Barney tried to emphasize that the cafeteria was technically run by Aramark, an outside contractor. But although Salomon denies it, Mr. Bitterman believes it was the confrontational pressure on the firm that got the matter resolved last month, after nearly a year of demonstrations.
"These are high-profile tactics," he said, "and they work."

The Roundness of the Ball, the Madness of the Feet

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
MY neighbor Ron wanted to know if I needed a personal shrink at the World Cup. Well, of course I do.
My wife's doctor, the former captain of Guatemala, was eating his heart out because a family wedding will keep him from this World Cup. 
 My barbers were plotting where they could catch the daytime games on cable.
One of the last faces I saw in the States, a skycap at J.F.K., said he is rooting for Jamaica because the Caribbean islands have to stick together. He is from Trinidad, "and we almost made it in 1990."
I was there, I told him. I was in Port-of-Spain that day Paul Caligiuri thumped the magic goal that denied Trinidad and Tobago passage to the World Cup in Italy. I told the skycap that I have never seen more sportsmanlike fans than the gracious Trinidadians who patted American journalists on the back as if we had a rooting interest.
We told them it would have been a better story if the little nation had qualified.
Going to the World Cup. Some nations take it as their due, some nations have been waiting for much of this century.
Going to the World Cup is so important that Air France employees used this moment to stage a strike that inconvenienced thousands and threatened the logistics of the World Cup.
Even Americans are getting into it. ABC, ESPN, ESPN2 and Univision surveyed all hyphenated Americans and people with dual passports and roots to other lands, Americans who have lived overseas and caught the pulse of the people, plus the parents of millions of youthful players, this growing soccer nation.
These four channels are presenting all 64 games of this World Cup, even with Jordan madness and McGwire madness going on in our own little isolationist land.
When he visited Paris for a basketball exhibition last fall, Michael Jordan was asked what he thought about Ronaldo. Jordan was not trying to be rude, but he had to admit he had no clue who Ronaldo was.
Ronaldo, on the other hand, has heard of Michael Jordan. Ronaldo is the giant painted on the side of a building near the Porte d'Auteuil. He went to the French tennis tournament the other day and Anna Kournikova nearly genuflected.
On Wednesday, millions of fans all over the world will cheer or mutter at Ronaldo's feints and runs as Brazil opens its defense against Scotland. He may not even score a goal, but the world knows soccer is an art form, not something to be captured in a box score that says 13 field goals, 12 foul shots, 11 rebounds and 6 assists.
For weeks now I have been trying to figure out how I can explain the World Cup to the folks back home whose minds were set in stone when the great DiMaggio or the great Mantle was roaming center field in Yankee Stadium. The closest I can come is a global version of the national college basketball tournament, which begins with 64 teams, March Madness, and narrows down to the Final Four.
The soccer powers have enlarged their tournament to 32 teams this year, to make it more democratic (all right, to sell more sporting goods around the world). The expansion has drawn economic powers like Japan and island nations like Jamaica for the very first time. There is Croatia. There is Iran. There is South Africa. Some of these nations will be the Prairie Views and the Fairfields, seeing what they can do with the Kentuckys and the North Carolinas.
The Yanks were in that position in 1990, a bunch of schoolboys sent out to the World Cup, suddenly having a swarm of hairy-legged lugs from Austria and Italy and Czechoslovakia kicking their ankles, faking them out of their shin guards, doing things with a ball our lads had never seen before.
This year the operative American hope is to steal a tie in the first game, before the Germans sort out their elderly and their wounded, assert itself against Iran's religious passion and steal another tie from Yugoslavia, and thereby slip into the second round.
I don't think the United States has the firepower or the cohesion to advance.
(Who will win? My first World Cup was 1982, therefore my heart always expects Paolo Rossi to come roaring downfield on counterattack for Italy.)
For any nation, for any fan, simply being at the World Cup is quite glorious. Ask my neighbor Ron, our doctor friend, the barbers in my town, the skycap at J.F.K., the millions in America's soccer nation.
Just don't ask them while the games are on.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
For Better Earnings, Try Bigger Write-Offs

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
While the stock market ended last week on a high note, pleased with the mix of economic reports, one little-noted piece of data had ominous implications for investors.
Corporate write-offs, as a percentage of the reported earnings per share of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, surged in the first quarter to 14 percent. Of the $10.25 a share that the S.& P. 500 companies reported in earnings for the quarter, write-offs totaled $1.44 a share. 
 This is more than just a blip. Gabrielle Napolitano, vice president for investment research at Goldman, Sachs, has collected such data for 10 years. She says write-offs have never been higher than they are now.
This is unusual given that we are in an economic boom. Some of the write-offs are a result of mergers, in which companies deduct acquisition charges. The Asian crisis is another factor: 35 percent of the first quarter's write-offs related to commercial banks' loan-loss provisions.
But an alarmingly large chunk of the write-offs -- 15.3 percent -- were nonrecurring charges related to the purchase of so-called in-process research and development. That was up 70 percent over last year.
Why alarming? The rise may indicate that increasing numbers of companies are using an arcane accounting rule to artificially bolster their earnings.
Whenever one company acquires another, some of the assets are of little value to the combined companies. That is especially true for technology or pharmaceutical concerns. Accounting rules allow the acquiring company to write off immediately against earnings the total value of the in-process R & D that its management considers worthless. It is a nonrecurring charge.
Why should this matter to an investor? Because it affects a company's earnings. Since the one-time charge reduces the value of the acquired assets, it also lowers depreciation expense in future years. And depreciation charges shrink earnings.
So when a company takes a one-time write-off for purchased R & D, future earnings look better than they would have had the company depreciated those assets over time. And if the assets turn out to be not so worthless after all, any income they produce drops straight to the bottom line, unimpeded by depreciation expense.
Howard M. Schilit, president of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis in Rockville, Md., notes that these write-offs not only are much more prevalent today, but that they now amount to big money. "We're seeing a lot of companies that put absurd amounts -- even 95 percent of the purchase price of an acquisition -- into in-process R & D write-offs," he said.
Consider the peculiar case of Applied Materials Inc., a formerly high-flying maker of semiconductor equipment. In the quarter ending in January, it paid $32.2 million to a company in a licensing agreement. Rather than consider the fee an operating expense, as Mr. Schilit said would be typical, Applied Materials called it in-process R & D, even though no acquisition had transpired. That accounting improved the company's operating cash flow by 26 percent.
"Companies do more of these things when their business weakens," Mr. Schilit said. "If things are humming, they don't need to reach." The company was closed Friday and did not return a phone message seeking comment.
Indeed, in the same quarter, the company's margins fell significantly. In the April quarter, sales dropped 10 percent.

HEADLINE: WORLD CUP '98;
Off to France: A U.S. Coach Who Speaks Spanish

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
The United States had been eliminated, 1-0, by Brazil from the 1994 World Cup, and when the Americans returned to their team hotel in southern California, forward Eric Wynalda found himself talking to the assistant coach Steve Sampson at poolside.
"What are you going to do now?" Wynalda asked Sampson. 
 "I have no idea," Sampson replied.
No one, least of all Sampson, thought he would be head coach of the Americans for the 1998 World Cup in France. For one thing, no American-born coach had ever led the United States into the final round of soccer's world championship. For another, Sampson had never played professionally or coached a professional club team.
"I knew his ambition one day was to be the national team coach," said Alan I. Rothenberg, president of the United States Soccer Federation. "I held out hope for him in the future, but the much more distant future."
But a harmonic convergence of improbable events has landed Sampson exactly where no one thought he would be -- coaching the Americans in the World Cup as they prepare for first-round matches against Germany in Paris on June 15; against Iran in Lyons on June 21 and against Yugoslavia in Nantes on June 25.
As one of the three youngest coaches at the World Cup, and as the first American-born coach given this opportunity, Sampson, 41, has employed an assertive style on offense and a new overall formation to take advantage of strength in the midfield. He has also made the bold, controversial decision to remove John Harkes, the former team captain, from the World Cup squad and to bench such mainstays on defense as Alexi Lalas and Marcelo Balboa.
He has remade the team according to his own design, and his future will be largely determined by whether his players adhere to his daring blueprint.
Since Sampson became coach on an interim basis in 1995, the United States has collected some of its most important victories, defeating such world powers as Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. Unlike many international coaches, who have little formal education, Sampson holds a master's degree in education, and his skill at communicating with his players has set him distinctly apart from his successful, but enigmatic, predecessor, Bora Milutinovic.
Milutinovic, a Serb who is now coaching Nigeria, his fourth team in the World Cup, played a defensive style that seemed to fit the Americans in 1994, many of whom were inexperienced in the international game. Instinct was Milutinovic's strength, not communication. He kept his own players, even his assistant coaches, in the dark about his plans. "My friend," he would tell them, "if you know me you will have no trouble following me."
Success for Milutinovic meant not conceding goals. Players did not dare challenge his decisions, lest they be removed from the team. The United States advanced to the second round, but it played not to lose instead of to win. Brazil defeated the Americans in 1994 even though it played the second half a man down after Leonardo was ejected for elbowing Tab Ramos in the head. Four years later, Sampson has given the team a more open and ambitious system, one designed to produce goals and a firm understanding of each player's role.
"Steve allows his players to express their opinions," Wynalda said. "And we're playing to win instead of not to lose. If we played Brazil again with 10 men in the World Cup, we would win, no doubt."
Daily, Sampson makes it a point to speak with at least three of his players in private conversation. Every player gets a private chat once a week.
"Not that I minded that Bora wasn't an American, but Steve can relate to players easier," midfielder Claudio Reyna said. "He knows we want to go forward and have fun playing the game."
Sampson's impeccable scouting report played a significant role in the Americans' surprise 2-1 victory over Colombia in the 1994 World Cup. He speaks fluent Spanish, which he has used to court the large Hispanic-American constituency in soccer and to better understand the politics and psyches of regional soccer opponents in Central and South America. In anticipation of the World Cup match with Iran, Sampson has a Farsi-speaking aide combing Iranian Web sites and chat rooms on the Internet, hoping to gain the slightest psychological and tactical edge.
"Speaking Spanish, I can now find out what makes a national team click anywhere in the Hispanic-speaking world," said Sampson, who lives in Agoura Hills, Calif., with his wife, Sheri, and three children. "I know the pressures put on players and teams and that some handle pressure different than others. I need to do the same thing with Germany and Iran. Understanding their culture and what makes them tick will have a lot to do with how well we respond."
He added: "Politics, culture, religion all play a part in the makeup of the Iranian team. Anyone who doesn't think those are connected is naive. It's more important for them to beat us than to get to the second round, in my opinion. This is more than just sport. This is the identity of a country that is trying to make its place among what are considered the best nations in the world."
Sampson was born in Salt Lake City and moved with his family to the Bay Area in northern California at age 2. He began playing soccer at age 6, and played collegiately at San Jose State and at U.C.L.A. But he tore cartilage in his knee, and the North American Soccer League was not exactly handing out rich contracts to Americans who lacked speed and had retread wheels. If Sampson wanted to remain in the game, he would have to coach.
From the beginning, he was ambitious. In 1981-82, while he obtained his master's degree from Stanford, Sampson simultaneously coached four amateur teams and played semipro soccer. Coaching the national team was a pipe dream, not a real pursuit. He left Stanford $20,000 in debt and took an assistant coaching job at U.C.L.A., sleeping on a friend's sofa for a year and a half. All of his possessions fit in three drawers.
To supplement his income, Sampson became head of U.C.L.A.'s athletic department tutoring service. He even designed the basketball locker room at Pauley Pavilion. But what he really wanted to be was a head coach in soccer. In 1986, Santa Clara came calling; expectations were nothing higher than an occasional conference title. In his first month on the job, Sampson filed a five-year plan for winning a national championship. In his fourth year, he delivered.
Still, there was nothing to suggest that he would soon be coaching the United States in the World Cup any time soon. For the 1994 World Cup, Sampson was hired as a member of the organizing committee, not the coaching staff. But the business end of soccer was something with which he was neither happy nor successful. And in 1993, when Milutinovic wanted to hire a Serbian assistant coach, Rothenberg said, "First, you must hire an American." Sampson happily took the elevator from the front office down to field level.
Coaching jobs in soccer are about as stable as the Russian economy. Milutinovic was fired in 1995, but Sampson was not the first choice as his replacement. Or the second choice. Rothenberg did not believe any American was experienced enough to coach on the international level. So he offered the job to Carlos Alberto Parreira, who led Brazil to the 1994 World Cup title. Then he offered it to Carlos Quieroz of Portugal. Only when they turned it down did Rothenberg offer the job to Sampson.
The catch was, it was an interim designation. It was Sampson's first turn as a professional head coach. The only way to keep his job was to win and to win immediately. Stunningly, he did. Freed from the defensive moorings of Milutinovic, Sampson's team played jubilantly in the summer of 1995, defeating Nigeria, Argentina, Chile and Mexico twice. By August of that year, the word "interim" was dropped.
His job seemed in jeopardy as the Americans played fitfully during qualifying games for the 1998 World Cup, but a 0-0 draw in Mexico City, achieved despite being a man down for 58 minutes, solidified Sampson's position last November. A 3-0 victory over Canada a week later made him the first American-born coach to qualify the United States for soccer's world championship. Rothenberg extended Sampson's contract through the World Cup.
"If there is a burden on my shoulders, it is that I truly want to be successful for the image of American coaches," Sampson said. "For so long, American coaches were excluded from this kind of opportunity."
Secure for the moment, Sampson set out to remake his team. "It's difficult to make bold decisions when they're questioning whether you're going to be the coach or not," Sampson said. His most intrepid, and controversial, decision was to remove Harkes who, in Sampson's eyes, lacked a willingness to play defense and was a disciplinary problem. The move is not popular with all of Harkes's former teammates. "He's a good person and a great player who should be here," Lalas said. But Sampson said he is losing no sleep over the decision.
"I want to be known as a coach who bases his decisions on principle," Sampson said. "Certain things cannot be allowed, no matter how good a player you are."
He has also sent Lalas, the most recognizable American player, and Balboa, the most experienced in an American uniform, to the bench in a new 3-6-1 system that features three defenders, six midfielders and one forward. And he was not hesitant to bring in the French defender David Regis, who received his American citizenship in mid-May, replacing others who had worked hard to help the team qualify for one, and in some cases, two World Cups.
"Isn't it my job to put the best American team on the field?" Sampson said.
Since 1994, soccer has gained in visibility in the United States to the point that Sampson said he will be recognized by several people if he walks through a mall. Of course, some of them confuse him with the golfers Nick Faldo and Peter Jacobson. Once, while waiting for his bags in Los Angeles International Airport, a man approached Sampson and said, "You had a great tournament last weekend."
American success (advancing to the second round) or failure in the World Cup will determine whether Sampson is invited to continue coaching the national team. If not, he would most likely look to coach a national team in Central or South America.
"How well he does is totally in his and his team's hands," Rothenberg said. "I hope he continues to be as good, and/or as lucky, as he's been all along."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
From Lab To Patient, By Way of Your Den

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
THE advertisement seemed innocuous enough. A few minutes into the March 17 episode of "Home Improvement," the ABC sitcom, the TV screen flashed scenes of men and women rubbing their eyes as a female voice sang the praises of a new brand of prescription eye drops.
"It seems like you have tried just about everything," the voice cooed, "but now there is Patanol." Not only did Patanol, developed by Alcon Laboratories, soothe "itchy allergy eyes for eight hours," the ad assured viewers, but only a few people "experience side effects, like a headache." 
For the millions of Americans who suffer from allergies, Patanol's promise of relief might have been, literally, too good to be true. The Food and Drug Administration took one look at the commercial and asked Alcon to take it off the air, saying that some of its claims of effectiveness were exaggerated and that the side effects were played down.
But that hardly made Patanol exceptional. Of the 22 products that have been advertised on TV since last August, the F.D.A. has found problems with 11 commercials -- including those for Pharmacia & Upjohn's Depo-Provera contraceptive and Galderma Laboratories' Metrogel lotion.
All of that only underscores what Federal regulators and the pharmaceutical industry have wrought in the last year: a bold experiment in directly marketing prescription drugs on TV to American consumers.
Ads like the one for Patanol are something of a yawner in the make-believe world created by Madison Avenue, where lizards scheme to kill Budweiser frogs and half-naked superstars sell Nike shoes. But they are just the initial forays in what marketing experts believe will be a steady march toward the kind of aggressive, image-filled and patently manipulative advertising that so successfully sells Americans everything from cars to cosmetics to computer chips.
Last August, the F.D.A. relaxed its barriers to television ads, letting pharmaceutical companies identify their products by name and describe their purposes. Since then, drug makers have rolled out a record number of campaigns, both in print and on television. They are expected to shell out some $350 million for television spots this year -- almost three times what they spent just two years ago, according to I.M.S. Health, a consulting firm.
The best ads have worked their magic, making blockbusters of drugs like Schering-Plough's Claritin brand of antihistamines, which has grabbed 54 percent of its market.
And the industry, eager to cash in on life-style drugs aimed at aging baby boomers -- products like Merck's Propecia for fighting baldness and Glaxo Wellcome's Zyban for kicking the tobacco habit -- is certain to press the F.D.A. to loosen its guidelines when the agency completes a review of its policies this summer.
So far, the F.D.A., for all its storied fastidiousness about protecting consumers from dangerous medications, has taken a surprisingly wait-and-see attitude on advertising drugs.
But in the meantime, pharmaceutical companies are reveling in their new-found freedom.
"Advertising directly to consumers is one of the most successful movements ever in the pharmaceuticals industry," said Neil Sweig, a pharmaceuticals analyst with Southeast Research Partners, a brokerage firm in Boca Raton, Fla. "It is the product of advertising executives all over America who went to sleep each night trying to figure out how to sell prescription drugs to the public without upsetting the apple cart at the F.D.A."
IT won't be easy. The ads unleashed the last several months have prompted an outcry from doctors and consumer advocates, who fear that the commercials could confuse or mislead the public.
Beyond the frequency of dubious claims, the critics contend that sales pitches for prescription drugs often offer false hope and encourage people to march into their doctors' offices to demand prescriptions for drugs they know almost nothing about. Some physicians view the ads as a personal affront -- proof, they say, that pharmaceutical executives see them as nothing more than highly paid prescription writers.
"A big problem with some consumer prescription drug ads is that they are so simplistic," said Dr. Gillian Shepherd, an allergist and clinical associate professor at New York Hospital Cornell Medical Center. "The ads make like these drugs work on all people and in every case. It simply doesn't work that way."
Pharmaceutical and many advertising executives tell a different story. Consumer drug ads, they say, not only educate patients about diseases and available treatments, they also persuade people to see doctors.
"In some instances, the doctors may not know everything about the drug," said Mark Schwatka, executive vice president of Grey Advertising Inc., the creator of consumer drug campaigns for Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. "Some doctors could learn something from these ads they can't stand."
Within weeks of the F.D.A.'s decision last summer to relax its restrictions, ads for antihistamines became as common as spots for home-exercise machines.
For all of 1997, spending on consumer advertising for prescription drugs rose by 125 percent from the previous year, to $107 million, at Bristol-Myers Squibb; by 76 percent, to $122 million, at Merck, and by 57 percent, to $156.6 million, at Glaxo Wellcome, the industry's biggest consumer advertiser.
Schering-Plough paid $55.8 million to promote Claritin antihistamine, and reaped a 38 percent jump in United States sales, to $907 million.
By contrast, the growth in ad spending for pharmaceuticals as an industry has not been nearly as robust. Last year, the industry spent $3.2 billion in the United States promoting all its medications, up only 6 percent from 1996, according to Competitive Media Reporting, a unit of VNU N.V., a Dutch publisher.
"We never spent much money on television to advertise prescription drugs before last year," said Richard J. Lane, president of the United States pharmaceuticals division at Bristol-Myers Squibb. "Before the F.D.A. changed its rules, it was difficult to get the message across.
"In a typical commercial, we want the consumer to remember what we told them," he noted. "But with a drug commercial, the consumer must be persuaded to take action, see his doctor, make that appointment."
Recently, the airwaves have been particularly busy with commercials for prescription drugs, perhaps because the industry senses that its freedom may not last. The F.D.A., as part of its review, could reverse course and enact new restrictions, though it is unlikely to do so.
The F.D.A. first issued regulations in the late 1960's governing consumer advertising of prescription drugs, but it wasn't until 1981 that the first ad appeared in the mass media -- for Merck's Pneumovax, a pneumonia vaccine, in Reader's Digest. Little more appeared before Arthur Hull Hayes, then the F.D.A. commissioner, declared a moratorium in 1983 on consumer prescription-drug advertising to allow the the agency to re-evaluate the regulations.
The pharmaceutical companies waited for two years, but nothing happened. Pressured by Congress, the F.D.A. lifted its moratorium in 1985, with the initial guidelines still in place. A few months later, the CBS television network, eager to capture new ad revenue, released a set of rules all its own. CBS announced that it would feel free to broadcast responsible prescription-drug commercials, but would avoid those that tended to frighten or were overly emotional. Four years passed before it broadcast its first commercial for a prescription drug.
DRUG companies proceeded to experiment gingerly with how far they could push the envelope on commercials. The F.D.A. was insisting that television spots trumpeting a particular drug should also include detailed information about side effects and risk. To avoid cramming so many words on the screen, drug companies avoided the issue by mentioning only the brand and not its purpose, or by running a commercial about the illness in general without naming the drug.
For example, Upjohn & Company, now Pharmacia & Upjohn, ran television ads for Rogaine, its hair replacement drug, in the late 1980's without mentioning the name of the product. The spots used beach scenes with the line, "I always thought hair loss was as inevitable as the tides." The ad then urged people to see their doctors if they were concerned about thinning hair.
By May 1997, several television ads had begun to use obvious imagery to convey their products' purposes. Without mentioning allergies, Hoechst Marion Roussel's commercial for Allegra, an antihistamine, showed people surfing through wheat fields. After seeing that ad and meeting with Hoechst executives to discuss it, the F.D.A. decided to loosen its guidelines for a trial period.
Henceforth, companies would be allowed to identify their products and describe their use, as long as they included several elements: major risk information, an "800" number and an address for consumers to obtain further information; a reference to a print ad or Web site, and an appeal for consumers to discuss any medical problems with their doctors.
THE agency said it wanted to see whether companies would refrain from making exaggerated claims or playing down risks. "We were afraid that the pharmaceutical companies would stress far too much the drugs' advantages and not enough of the risks," said Nancy M. Ostrove, chief of the marketing practices and communications division at the F.D.A.
That was the agency's objection to an ad for Propecia that Merck recently ran in Time magazine, without a syllable about the drug's possible side effects. The F.D.A. said the omission was a violation of its guidelines. It could also be fodder for liabilities lawsuits.
A spokeswoman for Merck said the company believed the ad was not required to contain risk information because its primary purpose was to prod consumers to seek help. The F.D.A. disagreed, Merck said, and the company made immediate changes.
Over all, she said the agency had found much that was useful in print ads for prescription drugs, but that it would be continuously evaluating its policy on TV ads. "If we find that the prescription ads have negatively affected the patient-physician relationship, then we will rethink our whole position," she said.
So far, the public, though it has embraced the most heavily advertised drugs, has shown little interest in the debate. Yet consumer rights groups have been among the most vocal critics, with some urging a ban on TV ads.
"There have been a record number of new drugs introduced recently on the market," said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, executive director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a consumer advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader. The F.D.A., he said, had fallen behind in reviewing ads, so a lot of mistakes can get through. "The combination of a misled doctor and a misled patient," he said, "leads to the wrong prescription."
Drug companies are not required to submit their consumer ads to the F.D.A. for prior approval. And when violations of F.D.A. ground rules are caught, the penalties are almost nonexistent. Companies pay no fines and rarely have to issue corrective ads
Even so, advertisers operate under much stricter rules for prescription drugs than those enforced by the Federal Trade Commission for over-the-counter medication. Unlike the F.D.A., for example, the F.T.C. encourages comparative ads.
The problems with consumer ads for prescription drugs have not sat well with many doctors. Of 5,000 polled by I.M.S. Health on the Internet in December, 61 percent favored reducing the number of such ads or discontinuing them altogether.
The American Medical Association has had problems with the ads, too.
"A lot of these ads don't encourage patients to get back to their doctors," said Dr. Nancy W. Dickey, president-elect of the A.M.A. "Now we have come to understand that some of these ads can be educational. And that's fine. But we don't want them to go the way of floor wax and compare one drug to the next. The ads also have a way of interfering with the doctor-patient relationship."
So far, advertisers have refrained from making unfavorable comparisons to rivals' products, but the prospect of such TV slugfests clearly worries the F.D.A.
"If companies try comparative ads, we would really scrutinize those very heavily," Ms. Ostrove said. "We would demand to see the data from a controlled trial. We want the doctors to make decisions between one drug and another. It's when the pharmaceutical companies start pushing the envelope that everyone could get upset."
Even naysayers acknowledge that prescription-drug ads have the potential to benefit consumers, if, for example, they persuade them to go to the doctor's office. And that often happens. For example, Bristol-Myers Squibb's advertising campaign last year for Pravachol, its drug for cholesterol reduction and stroke prevention, urged consumers to see their physicians. And indeed, some 8.8 million people sought treatment last year for cholesterol-related therapies, up from 7.2 million in 1996, according to I.M.S. Health.
"Consumer prescription-drug campaigns are both a blessing and a curse," said Dr. Shepherd of New York Hospital Cornell Medical Center. "They are a blessing in that they increase awareness of a specialty, as with the antihistamines for allergies, for example. And the campaigns can bring patients into a doctor's office."
The curse? Patients often ask for drugs they don't need.
Doctors may not like patients to request a prescription drug they have seen on television, but, on the other hand, they're willing to discuss the pros and cons with them.
Of 3,000 doctors polled in the first quarter of this year by Scott-Levin, a pharmaceutical market-research firm in Newtown, Pa., 89 percent said they would discuss an advertised drug with a patient even if they thought the ad for it had been misleading. Such numbers make marketing executives salivate.
To no one's surprise, many pharmaceutical executives want to stretch the F.D.A.'s rules a little more. One sore spot is the agency's requirement that the highly technical language about risks and side effects that appear on a product's label also appear in some print ad copy.
They argue that such wording -- including Merck's warning that its Propecia could interfere with the P.S.A. test for screening prostate cancer -- often befuddles people.
"We are still evolving with how we do these commercials," said Mr. Lane of Bristol-Myers Squibb. "But the language with the warnings about the drugs needs to be more consumer-friendly. There's too much techno-jargon. That doesn't foster the kind of dialogue we want."
And for all the companies' current restraint, some advertising experts believe Americans may eventually see commercials mocking rival drugs, in marketing tussles similar to the famous battles between Pepsi and Coke or between Peter Pan and Jif peanut butter.
"We understand that we are not selling Lay's potato chips," said Mr. Schwatka of Grey Advertising. "Drugs are powerful stuff. But consumers are definitely going to be seeing more ads for prescription drugs. And they're going to be getting more information about those drugs. Information does not go backward. It only moves forward."

HEADLINE: You Too Can Be Rated AAA

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
MICHAEL JORDAN may be the best basketball player in history. He may have more trophies and rings and sneaker contracts than any man on the planet. He may even, as Fortune magazine has just calculated, have contributed $10 billion to the global economy over the last decade.
But he has not yet made the big leap that, if Wall Street has its way, is in the future for all sorts of athletes and artists: the leap from marketable commodity to tradeable security. 
 Almost everyone and everything seems to be turning into a security these days. Frank Thomas, the White Sox slugger, is working on a deal with SPP Hambro Securities to offer investors a stake in his future earnings. Dusty Springfield, the 1960's pop singer, is cooking up something with Prudential Investments. The songwriting team of Holland, Dozier and Holland, who penned such Motown hits as "Stop! In the Name of Love," just sold $30 million of securities backed by their royalties (their investment banker says the bonds got an A rating from Moody's Investors Service).
Entertainers are the least of it. Wall Street is securitizing virtually everything that produces a predictable stream of cash. Typhoon insurance. Tax liens. Loans for used cars and fraternity houses. Fax machine leases. Mutual-fund fees. Unused airline tickets. Movies yet to be made. Even defunct power plants.
The alchemy by which Wall Street turns stuff into securities varies. The old-fashioned method is the stock offering, which has been used by a number of sports teams. But there are risks for celebrities who go public: both Debbie Reynolds's casino and Wilt Chamberlain's restaurant chain bombed in the stock market.
Then there are derivatives, so called because their prices are derived from the value of something else, like an index or a security or a commodity. Some involve relatively straightforward bets on things like the price of soybeans or Microsoft shares. The infamous variety -- like the ones that got Orange County, Calif., in trouble -- often involve wagers so arcane as to be inexplicable. In the works are derivatives that let investors bet on the temperature or rainfall in a geographic region.
But the really big idea on Wall Street today is securitization, which began with home mortgages in the 1980's. Banks had made a lot of them and wanted to sell them, but to whom?
Then someone had a bright idea. If Wall Street put together a whole bunch of mortgages, the bundles would look almost like traditional bonds. They would be relatively safe investments, because even if one borrower defaulted, there would be plenty of others still paying. Bond buyers, like mutual funds, pension funds and amateur investors, jumped on these mortgage-backed securities.
This led to a creative burst on Wall Street. If securities could be made out of mortgages, why not car loans, credit-card receivables, business loans or bad debts?
Right now, a number of firms on Wall Street are trying to securitize consumers' electric bills. The goal is to lower utilities' borrowing costs, creating savings that can be passed on to consumers, said Joseph S. Fichera, an investment banker at Prudential Securities. "It's like refinancing your mortgage," he said.
The newest and sexiest twist involves using streams of income from entertainers. In the first such deal, the rock star David Bowie sold $55 million of bonds last year backed by his anticipated royalties.
Creating such deals has proved harder than many investment bankers predicted, and the securities have been so complicated that they are offered only to professional investors. Nonetheless, several Wall Street firms have set up entertainment subsidiaries, like one at Nomura that raised money for Rod Stewart.
David Pullman, the investment banker who successfully sold the Bowie and Motown deals, says he has more up his sleeve. Film libraries, television syndications, literary estates -- all could be turned into securities, says Mr. Pullman, a managing director at Fahnestock & Company, a New York-based securities firm.
Mr. Pullman said ticket sales at sports stadiums were another possibility for securitization. Individual athletes' earnings are trickier because their contracts contain too many outs like morals clauses, he said. But he added, "We could do it if they had no cut contracts or endorsements."
One of the few who might qualify is Michael Jordan, of course. If Fortune is right, he'd be rated triple-A. Stockbrokers will be standing by to take your call.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
For Marriage Tax, A Messy Divorce

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TO Republicans intent on damning the tax code as an inequitable tangle that is strangling the American family, Sharon Mallory's appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee a few months back was just the ticket. Miss Mallory, a 41-year-old factory worker from Indiana, testified that she and her live-in boyfriend, Darryl Pierce, would like to get married but could not afford the $3,700 in additional taxes it would cost them.
"Darryl and I love each other very much and want to be married," Miss Mallory said. "But the IRS won't let us. We're victims of the marriage penalty." 
 Fueled by such anecdotal outrage, Congress is well on its way toward overhauling the tax-law provisions that push many two-income couples into a higher tax bracket than they would be in if they were single.
The House took a big step in that direction on Friday, adopting a budget plan that makes eliminating the marriage penalty the No. 1 Republican tax goal this year.
"It all traces back to one simple question: Do Americans feel that it's right to tax a working couple more just because they live in holy matrimony?" said Representative Jerry Weller, a Republican from Illinois.
But if the political appeal of attacking the marriage penalty is clear, the policy arguments are less so.
 
A Huge Price
More couples actually get a break from the way the tax code treats marriage than pay a penalty. Single people -- who are already at an economic disadvantage to couples since they cannot spread their living costs over two incomes -- would get nothing.
And the cost of eliminating or substantially reducing the penalty for those who do pay it would be huge. Many Republicans worry that it would crowd out other tax-cutting priorities, and Democrats fret about lost spending opportunities.
Making the case for keeping the marriage penalty is a treacherous business for members of both parties, few of whom are willing to risk being seen as undermining a venerated institution.
"I mean, anybody want to defend the marriage-penalty tax?" Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, asked facetiously last week as the Senate prepared to grapple with the issue.
The budget plan approved by the House on Friday would provide as much as $100 million over the next five years to eradicate or substantially reduce the marriage penalty.
In the Senate, both parties are seeking ways to use some of the revenues that would be generated by the proposed tobacco legislation to reduce the marriage penalty. Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican, is developing a plan that would give a break to couples earning less than $50,000, including those who are not affected by the marriage penalty. Democrats are developing a narrower version intended to help only couples who pay more because of the marriage tax.
But the growing momentum for a quick fix belies the complexity of addressing the marriage penalty.
For one thing, the penalty is hardly universal. While more than 20 million couples paid more in taxes in 1996 than they would have if they were single, 25 million couples got a marriage bonus: They paid less as a couple than they would have if they were single.
Most of the bonuses already go to the very families that social conservatives consider the most traditional -- those in which the husband works and the wife stays home. That is because the husband would be entitled to more exemptions and deductions than he got when he was single. For 1996, total bonuses of $32.9 billion, or $1,300 per couple, outweighed total penalties of $28.8 billion, or $1,380 per couple, by $4.1 billion.
Moreover, substantially reducing or eliminating the penalty without raising taxes elsewhere would cost the Federal Government at least $20 billion a year.
And while social conservatives want to allocate as much money as possible to reducing the penalty, business groups and supply-side Republicans and economists are queasy about allowing the issue to crowd out cuts in other areas, like income tax rates, capital gains taxes and inheritance taxes. Cuts that target a specific group are considered by many economists to be an inefficient way of promoting economic growth.
Perhaps most fundamentally, lawmakers have long found it difficult to address the marriage penalty without creating some other perceived inequity. Most of the proposals would do nothing for single people. Most of the proposed fixes would also give more help to people at the top of the income scale than those at the bottom.
And some of the proposals would complicate the problem by levying different amounts of taxes on couples with the same combined incomes.
The current law is the product of decades of swings in policy and public opinion about how to treat the income of married couples in a way that is fair to two-income families, single-earner couples, unmarried people and people across the income spectrum.
 
Nothing's Perfect
"You can't get a perfect system," said Iris J. Lav, deputy director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research organization. "I think that where we are right now is largely a reasonable compromise given the competing demands of the tax system."
When the Federal income tax was established in 1913, it was levied on individuals, with no special provision made for married couples. Starting in the 1920's, when relatively few married women worked, some states passed laws allowing married couples to split their income and pay at a lower rate than the husband would if he had to file as an individual.
In 1948, Congress responded by changing the law to allow joint filing, widening tax brackets enough that most married couples paid less than if they were single.
But, as Michael J. Graetz recounted in "The Decline (and Fall?) of the Income Tax" (W. W. Norton, 1997), what couples saw as a bonus, single people saw as a penalty. So in 1969, following years of protests, Congress changed the tax brackets to reduce the amount single people paid -- causing some married people, for the first time, to pay more as a couple than they would if single.
Soon protests about the marriage penalty were heard. Best known of the protesters were David and Angela Boyter, Federal employees from Baltimore who would divorce for tax purposes each December and then remarry early in the new year to reduce their taxes. Congress responded by creating a two-earner deduction in 1981.
But the deduction was eliminated in 1986. Since then, as the number of two-income couples has increased, more people have became subject to the marriage penalty. And the pressure to fix the marriage penalty has increased accordingly.

HEADLINE: The World;
Even the French Hate This Strike

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
TRANSPORTATION strikes are an annoying fact of life in France, yet most people sympathize with the strikers when the subways shut down or truckers block the highways. After all, truck drivers and railway workers don't make much money, and employers seldom penalize workers for not showing up during transit strikes, so it's easy to wish the strikers well.
But the renowned Gallic sang-froid was severely tested last week by a strike by pilots at Air France, the state-owned airline, just days before the nation plays host to the World Cup, the World Series of soccer. 
 The pilots, whose average annual salary of $123,000 makes them better paid than their counterparts at other major European carriers like Lufthansa and British Airways, were protesting a management plan to trim their pay by an average of $26,000 over the next three to five years, and replace the income with stock options.
With Air France, the official carrier for the World Cup, able to fly only a fraction of its schedule, the French public was outraged, for the first time in years, by what many saw as greedy pilots. A poll published by Paris-Match last week showed that only 47 percent of those polled supported holding a transportation strike during the World Cup. In December 1995, 62 percent of those surveyed sympathized with striking rail and transport workers; in November 1996, 74 percent supported striking truck drivers.
 
A Christmas Present
"I feel sad and almost ashamed," said Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement as negotiators were trying to reach a settlement before the games kick off on Wednesday.
Mr. Chevenement and the Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, were elected a year ago by voters who never forgave Mr. Jospin's conservative predecessor, Alain Juppe, for trying to cut the pension benefits of the rail and transit workers in 1995 as part of an unpopular Government austerity plan to prepare for the coming single European currency. When strikers shut down rail and mass transit networks, the country was paralyzed, but with Christmas approaching many workers were just as happy to back the strikers and stay home.
This time things were different. The irony of a Socialist-led Government criticizing strikers is only one of many contradictions in the latest episode in France's struggle to pull its cosseted welfare-state economy into the 21st century.
Mr. Chevenement even had to deny rumors that he was considering calling in the French equivalent of the National Guard to replace the strikers the way President Reagan replaced striking American air traffic controllers in the early 1980's.
The French feel as strongly about soccer as they do about social justice. Taxpayers put up $450 million for a new stadium in Paris for the World Cup, and Air France planes have been splashed with bright color pictures of players from 32 countries. Buses in Paris display welcome signs in many languages, and special trains have been arranged to transport fans and players among the 10 cities in which the 64 games will be played.
France's national honor is at stake, the authorities keep reminding people. No American-style private-sector improvisation, a la Atlanta during the last Olympics and Denver during the 1994 World Cup, would do for the glory of France.
With a sense that the eyes of the world were on them, many French felt indignation when transportation unions started in with business as usual -- by trying to hold up employers for ransom just when their work was most needed.
The pilots were not the only ones on the picket lines, though truck drivers, who shut down the country's roads in 1997 and the year before to get higher wages, promised they wouldn't think of inconveniencing their fellow citizens during the World Cup, which ends on July 12.
A union representing 30 percent of the engineers for the state railway network called a strike to begin on the eve of the Cup opening. Conductors struck and disrupted rail traffic around the country on Friday. Public transportation in Lyons, where five games will be played, was shut down by a strike on Tuesday, and workers on the Paris municipal transportation system threatened another for this week.
 
Suspicious of Stocks
But it was the pilots who bore the brunt of public resentment.
The French are notoriously suspicious of people who are better off than they are, to the point of making anonymous telephone calls to Finance Ministry inspectors to tip them off to people with lavish life styles (one reason why owners of luxury homes in Paris often hide them behind dilapidated building facades).
So it was difficult to muster much sympathy for the well-paid pilots, who after all were not striking for better wages but demanding cash instead of stock options as part of their salaries when Air France is partly privatized later this year.
The airline said it needed to cut its annual payroll by $84 million to make itself more competitive in the European market, but many French regard the stock market as a sort of untrustworthy gambling casino. As elsewhere in Europe, there is great resistance here to the idea of supplementing state pensions with the private investment plans that make union pension funds such big players in the stock market in America.
Nevertheless, Transportation Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, a member of the Communist Party, railed against the pilots. "France, the company and the World Cup must not be held hostage," he told Parliament as pressure mounted on both the Government and the strikers to settle. "We must negotiate and we must break this logjam."
Even Le Canard enchaine, a left-wing satirical newspaper, lost patience with the pilots.
"Their maneuvering a week from the Cup, with thousands of passengers about to pour into the country, could easily be mistaken for blackmail," the newspaper wrote, pointing out that the pilots also showed little gratitude for the $3.4 billion taxpayers pumped into Air France during its money-losing years to keep it going and safeguard the pilots' jobs.

Money Politics Wasn't Defeated in California

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
MONEY is the mother's milk of politics," is the maxim coined by Jesse M. Unruh, the liberal Democrat who reigned as Speaker of the California State Assembly in the 1960's, and indeed, cash has always been an essential commodity in campaigns. The primary in California last week was the most expensive statewide election in American history, with $100 million spent on races for governor, United States senator and a handful of ballot propositions.
But a funny thing happened: The rich guys lost. 
 The resounding defeat of Al Checchi, a half-billionaire businessman who spent $40 million of his own money in the race for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, brought forth a certain populist euphoria -- a new conventional wisdom across the land that even in flashy California, money can't buy you voters' love.
But tempting as it might be in light of current campaign-finance scandals to conclude that voters rejected the corrosive power of money in politics, the reality is considerably more complex, and less uplifting.
For one thing, the winning candidate, Lieut. Gov. Gray Davis, a 23-year veteran of state politics, is himself a relentless fund-raiser, one often accused of blending his campaign-finance outings with his official duties. And even if he seemed a pauper compared to Mr. Checchi, his campaign spending still broke the old $9 million record for a gubernatorial primary campaign here, set in 1994.
Furthermore, a contrary example of the power of money loomed just as large here last week: A $20-million campaign by organized labor managed to defeat a ballot measure that would have required unions to obtain annual written consent of their members before using dues for political purposes. The measure was favored in early public opinion polls, but its opponents outspent supporters 3 to 1, and union members went to the polls in unusually large numbers, helping Mr. Davis in the process.
 
Log Cabins and Pork Rinds
There isn't much evidence that the rules of wealth and politics have dramatically changed. Since at least the days of Andrew Jackson, Americans have been ambivalent toward the wealthy in politics, celebrating the triumph of log cabin little guys and viewing elites with suspicion. Still, wealthy candidates, from Roosevelts to Kennedys to Rockefellers to Bushes, have often been elected, though generally when they managed to cloak their wealth in a populist noblesse oblige and emphasize their empathy with the people. There was, for example, Nelson A. Rockefeller's invariable "Hiya, fella!" and George Bush's public fondness for pork rinds when his private taste ran to popcorn.
Some of those candidates spent money in ways that would almost certainly be subject to intense media scrutiny now; for example, by trading favors or greasing the palms of local political bosses. But since the 1976 Supreme Court ruling that the First Amendment right to free speech bars limits on a candidate's spending of his or her own money, millionaires have had an unchallenged license to test the political waters.
Money can buy name recognition for political newcomers like Mr. Checchi but it is no guarantee of success. A study by the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington found that of 149 candidates for the House and Senate in 1995-96 who put more than $100,000 of their own money into their campaigns, only 19 won. Still, the United States Senate remains a virtual millionaire's club, and in recent years, wealthy candidates from Ross Perot to Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin have managed to turn their private wealth into a campaign plus; they boast that they are free from the hold of special interests, as Mr. Kohl did when he won office in 1988 spending $7.5 million, most of it his own, with the slogan, "Nobody's Senator but yours."
"He called to congratulate us," said David Doak, Mr. Kohl's longtime media consultant, who worked here this year for Mr. Davis. Mr. Doak said his old boss, commenting on the California race, noted that it's one thing to use your own money to talk about yourself, "but you have to be real judicious about attacking somebody else, because people see it differently, and it can cross over into bullying."
 
Negativity
Indeed, politicians here and around the country said, Mr. Checchi's money had less to do with his defeat than how he chose to spend it. Even after 18 months crisscrossing the state talking to voters and 3 months of television commercials touting his private sector accomplishments and teaching voters how to pronounce his name (CHECK-ee), he drew about as many unfavorable ratings from poll respondents as favorable ones -- not good news for any candidate.
Then, when Representative Jane Harman, herself a millionaire, entered the race and promptly took the lead in public opinion polls, Mr. Checchi unleashed a relentless barrage of commercials attacking her, often in misleading terms. That helped destroy Ms. Harman, who spent some $16 million of family money on her campaign. But, in a kind of murder-suicide, it also quadrupled Mr. Checchi's own negative ratings and created an opening for Mr. Davis, who had been saving his advertising money for the final stretch.
In the race for the Republican Senate nomination to challenge Senator Barbara Boxer, Darrell Issa, a multimillionaire car alarm manufacturer who spent about $10 million, lost to State Treasurer Matt Fong, but only after a wave of harshly critical news accounts raised questions about Mr. Issa's business record and tactics.
Rich candidates have lost spectacularly in the past, of course, including the cosmetics heir Ronald S. Lauder, who spent $14 million in the 1989 Republican mayoral primary in New York City, and lost to Rudolph W. Giuliani, who spent $2.5 million and won 67 percent of the vote. Former Representative Michael Huffington, a Republican oil heir, set the previous national record for individual spending here four years ago, by pouring nearly $30 million of his family fortune into a nearly successful campaign against Senator Dianne Feinstein.
But Mr. Checchi's resounding defeat still set off ripples of shock, precisely because Mr. Huffington, who was widely regarded as a political and intellectual lightweight, came so close, and because Mr. Checchi, an altogether more serious figure, spent about 30 percent more in the primary alone than Mr. Huffington spent in his primary and general election combined.
In general in recent years, polls have shown that most voters are neutral-to-positive about candidates who finance their own campaigns, while support for public campaign financing is often tepid. But as this year's campaign wore on, voters here seemed taken aback by the sheer reach of Mr. Checchi's record-breaking effort.
A poll in April by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 6 in 10 voters were indifferent to a candidate's decision to finance his own campaign, but by May, voters indicated a marked preference, 52 percent to 34 percent, for candidates who took the conventional route of collecting money from supporters.
In his final days on the campaign trail, Mr. Checchi went low-tech, riding a yellow school bus around the state to highlight his proposals for fixing the state's troubled schools, and publicly lamenting that his rivals had outfoxed him by turning the race into a debate about his money instead of his ideas.
 
Change Wasn't Good
But Mr. Checchi was also the victim of his own promises to shake up the state's political establishment. Over and over again in campaign appearances, he told audiences, "If you don't want change, don't vote for me," and voters appeared to take him at his word. Surveys of voters leaving the polls found that two-thirds thought California was on the right track after years of economic collapse and natural disasters, and polls repeatedly found that voters preferred candidates with experience in government.
Experts cautioned against reading too much into Mr. Checchi's defeat.
"There's an awful lot of negativity in American politics, and it's not going to go away," said Herbert E. Alexander, a retired professor or political science at the University of Southern California and an expert on campaign finance. "In my view, that would mean candidates would have to get a bigger bang for the dollars that they can spend. The high cost of television means now that you have to go for the jugular, and in those circumstances, it would lead to even more negativity than we've experienced now."

At What Cost?

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
It has a nice name, the "African Growth and Opportunity Act," and a clever slogan, "trade not aid," but a bill now before Congress is in fact an enormous benefits package for thriving multinational corporations and a threat to the very sovereignty of the sub-Saharan nations that sponsors of the bill say they want to help.
The bill narrowly passed the House in March, where it was introduced and pushed hard by Representative Philip Crane, an Illinois Republican who has referred to some developing African countries and their leaders as "retards." (A spokeswoman told me on Friday that the Congressman had not intended to offend anyone.) 
 The sponsor in the Senate, which has yet to vote on the measure, is Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican. The bill has the strong backing of the Clinton Administration, as well as such giant corporations as Texaco, Coca-Cola and Kmart.
The aim of the bill is to liberalize trade between the United States and Africa. It would, among other things, allow duty-free and quota-free exports to the U.S. for 10 years, support the creation of a U.S.-sub-Sahara free-trade agreement and encourage the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to set up funds to stimulate private development in Africa.
But the bill also makes some demands. In essence, participating countries would have to adhere to the harsh and often inhumane requirements of the International Monetary Fund. Thus, these underdeveloped and often very poor countries would have to undergo a radical economic restructuring that would include cuts in corporate taxes, reductions in government spending and privatization of some of their most valuable assets -- mines, forests, harbors, oil wells and the like -- with the multinationals and other wealthy foreign investors ready to snap them up at fire-sale prices.
"What does this mean to the people on the ground in these countries?" asked Randall Robinson, the president of TransAfrica and an opponent of the Crane-Lugar bill.
He noted that I.M.F. structural adjustment programs are already under way in some African countries and studies of those programs have shown disturbing effects. Ghana is one example. It is cited as an I.M.F. success story. And yet, as Mr. Robinson pointed out, public spending on education, health and agriculture -- in accordance with I.M.F. dictates to limit spending -- has been falling. Health care for the poor has taken a particularly heavy hit, even though children are dying in staggering numbers.
Half of all deaths in Ghana in recent years have been of children under 5, though that age group makes up just one-fifth of the country's population.
In Senegal, under the guidance of the I.M.F., spending on education has been cut. One might ask what sense this makes in a country in which more than 65 percent of adults and 77 percent of all women are illiterate.
From the point of view of the I.M.F. and the multinationals, it makes economic sense.
The trade bill also requires participating countries to join the World Trade Organization, even though many African countries have chosen not to join. The Organization for Economic Development, a supporter of the W.T.O., has reported that sub-Saharan Africa would be a loser under W.T.O. rules because countries that import more food than they export would inevitably be hurt by requirements to cut domestic agriculture subsidies.
This is not a small matter. Four in 10 Africans suffer in some degree from hunger or malnutrition. Agricultural subsidies can be a matter of life and death in such populations.
But the trade bill fashioned in Washington says simply: you will join the W.T.O.
Attempts to amend the bill -- to modify the most onerous requirements -- have been beaten back. President Nelson Mandela of South Africa has characterized the bill as "not acceptable." But most sub-Saharan leaders, faced with desperately poor populations and desperately high unemployment, have signed on. They appear to hope that in some way, somehow, a trade agreement with the big boys, with the United States and its great corporations, will alleviate their economic suffering.
It's a situation ripe for wholesale exploitation.

ECONOMY
Up, Up and, for Some, Away
Sales of new single-family homes rose 5.2 percent in April to a record, and the Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.1 percent in April -- the fourth consecutive monthly increase. The index has not declined since April 1997. Separately, construction spending rose 0.8 percent in April, the fifth consecutive monthly gain. Factory orders rose 1.2 percent, the biggest increase in five months. On a less upbeat note, the productivity of workers continued to grow, but more slowly. And on a downright sour note, Americans filed nearly 342,000 personal bankruptcy petitions in the first quarter, up 6 percent from the period a year earlier, according to a lending industry group. 

MERGER
Advil Meets Nutra Sweet
In the largest deal ever in the pharmaceutical industry, the American Home Products Corporation said it would acquire the Monsanto Company for $34.4 billion in stock. The combined company would be the nation's top seller of prescription drugs and a world leader in insecticides and other agricultural products. Its brands would include Advil painkiller, Centrum vitamins and Nutra Sweet sugar substitute. The acquisition would allow American Home Products to double research spending, and would also cover its legal liabilities from two diet drugs that have been taken off the market.
 
ORANGE COUNTY
Gambling Without Casinos
Merrill Lynch & Company agreed to pay $400 million to Orange County, Calif., in a legal settlement that will largely close the book on the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation's history. The settlement is by far the largest so far stemming from the 1994 Orange County bankruptcy, which created a morass of litigation as the county sought to recover some of the more than $1.6 billion it suffered in losses from risky investments. The county still has lawsuits pending against more than a dozen Wall Street securities houses and a variety of other companies. But Merrill Lynch was clearly the county's main target, since it was much more heavily involved than other companies in selling risky derivatives to the county-run investment pool.
 
VEHICLES
Pedal to the Metal
The nation's auto industry reported that May was the best month for car and truck sales since September 1986, with sales totaling 1.51 million cars and trucks, a 12.1 percent increase from the corresponding period last year. Moreover, fueled by hefty discounts, the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for light vehicles reached 16.3 million cars and trucks last month, the highest since October 1987. Lower gasoline prices have worked in Detroit's favor: The average price for regular gasoline at the pump decreased slightly last week, to $1.066 a gallon. It was about $1.22 a year ago.
 
ARMS RACE
A Nuclear Balance Sheet
Within a week of Pakistan's detonation of a sixth nuclear device, India increased its military budget by 14 percent, pushing total arms outlays to 19 percent of all Government spending. But even before India's action, The Nation magazine raised an interesting possibility: Is India using the arms race as a means of bankrupting its rival? A Princeton physicist and expert on the Pakistani nuclear program, Zia Mian, says India is much less dependent than Pakistan on the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Standard & Poor's also warned recently that it might cut both nations' credit ratings. That, The Nation contended, would hurt Pakistan more than India.
 
POLLUTION
Flipper's Revenge
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the world's second-largest cruise line, agreed to plead guilty to Federal charges of dumping oil at sea, lying to the Coast Guard about the discharges and tampering with witnesses and evidence, and as a result would pay $9 million in penalties. The practice saved tens of thousands of dollars a year per ship, the company said. In court, prosecutors said some officers had received bonuses for cutting operating costs. The offenses covered by the agreement occurred from 1990 to 1994, while Royal Caribbean's stewards and deckhands wore buttons that said "Save the Waves" and urged passengers not to bring on deck any paper goods or other objects that might blow overboard.

In what could become France's biggest wine scandal in decades, one of Bordeaux's most prestigious wine properties, Chateau Giscours, has been charged with fraudulent winemaking practices. According to the charges, cheap wine from another district was added to the chateau's, wine from two vintages was blended together, excess sugar was added to the wine to raise the alcohol content (sacre bleu!), and wood chips were used to give some of the chateau's wine the taste and smell of wine that had been aged in oak barrels. Giscours, one of the largest estates in the Medoc, was one of the 61 chateaus -- out of thousands in Bordeaux -- that were included in the 1855 classification that remains the standard by which prestige Bordeaux wines are known.
 
JOBS
Semiconductor Blues
Motorola Inc. announced that it would eliminate 15,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force, and take a $1.95 billion charge against second-quarter earnings, the strongest indicator yet of tough times in the semiconductor industry. The company also warned Wall Street that it would report an operating loss for the second quarter, its first plunge into the red since the semiconductor industry slump of 1985. Other high-technology companies have also announced cutbacks: National Semiconductor plans to lay off 1,400 people; Intel, the world's biggest chip maker, expects to eliminate 3,000 jobs through attrition, and Applied Materials, the biggest supplier of chip-making equipment, is offering voluntary severance packages to cut costs. For the economy as a whole, the unemployment rate was unchanged in May, at 4.3 percent.

HEADLINE: U.N. Aide Would Fight Drugs With a Better Life for Growers

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 5

 BODY:
With President Clinton and other world leaders coming here Monday for a special session of the General Assembly on the world's drug problems, the United Nations' top anti-narcotics official has submitted a two-pronged strategy that moves beyond the conventional approach of intercepting illegal drugs and arresting traffickers.
Pino Arlacchi, the executive director of the United Nations International Drug Control Program, proposes the ambitious target of eliminating opium poppies and coca plants, the raw ingredients of heroin and cocaine, in 10 years as well as substantially reducing marijuana. 
 To achieve this, he advocates so-called alternative development programs that would induce opium and coca growers to switch to less profitable legal crops by bringing roads, hospitals, schools and a better life into remote rural areas that depend on drug crops to survive.
Mr. Arlacchi has also proposed that nations reduce the demand for drugs by half over the next decade through prevention and treatment programs. Neither idea is new, but he said they had proved promising enough to try on a broader scale.
"These two cards have not been played in full," he said in an interview.
Alternative development has sometimes been viewed as costly and unrealistic, since opium and coca growers are reluctant to grow legal crops that would earn less income and be harder to take to market. Middlemen make the rounds of peasants to buy their raw opium and coca paste.
What is needed, Mr. Arlacchi said, is political authority to enforce eradication and development involving more than crop substitution.
"We would propose an alternative way of life," he said. "They can be rich peasants if they grow opium, but they can die if they don't have roads and hospitals."
Peru and Colombia have tried alternative development, Mr. Arlacchi said, and Peru has reduced its coca fields by 40 percent in two years. Bolivia has promised to phase out its coca over the next five years, he said.
Mr. Arlacchi said the cost would run far less than potential donors like the United States anticipate. He estimated that alternative development would require an additional amount of less than $250 million a year over the next decade. In comparison, the United States Government's annual drug control budget exceeds $16 billion.
Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the Clinton Administration's anti-drug chief, said that he agreed with demand reduction, but was not persuaded that it would be easy to get Afghans and Burmese, who together grow 90 percent of the world's opium, to change to other crops. But General McCaffrey added in a telephone interview from Washington, "We're supportive of Pino Arlacchi's focused high-energy leadership."
Mr. Arlacchi, whose enthusiasm belies a tough reputation earned fighting the Mafia in his native Italy, cited what he said were some conspicuous successes against drug trafficking in the last decade.
"We destroyed the myth of the invincibility of the drug cartels," he said. He said that the Medellin and Cali cocaine cartels in Colombia had been crushed and that some Asian opium warlords surrendered by striking deals with the military Government in Myanmar, formerly Burma, that let them keep their freedom and money. Thailand virtually eliminated opium production through alternative development, he added, and Pakistan had sharply cut back opium growing as well.

HEADLINE: Eager Freshman's Goal: 'Internationalize' Senate

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WEST POINT, Neb.

 BODY:
At Harry Knobbe's Feed Yards the other day, Senator Chuck Hagel was holding forth on the global economy, the Asian financial crisis and the International Monetary Fund with a dozen or so hog and cattle farmers.
Here in Cuming County, one of the largest cattle-producing counties in the United States, the farmers were hanging on every word. 
 "When the markets go down in Asia, it's not good for the United States and it's not good for Nebraska," Mr. Hagel said over sodas and sugar cookies, drawing approving nods and murmurs. "They can't buy your beef, pork and feed grains."
Getting his fellow senators to focus on international matters is a lot tougher than holding that discussion with farmers in a state that exports $1.6 billion worth of farm products to Asia each year.
"Many of my colleagues don't understand foreign affairs, they don't travel, they don't get out," Mr. Hagel said later. "They're scared of taking trips that will be labeled political junkets. They don't have much interest, and they don't see the relevancy."
Translating the lexicon of Washington foreign policy into nuts-and-bolts realities for constituents and other senators is a steep challenge for Mr. Hagel. But even as the freshman Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, ranked 98th in seniority out of 100 Senators, he is proving an influential new voice in foreign affairs.
At a time when the country is looking inward, Mr. Hagel, a 51-year-old self-made millionaire, is preaching the virtues of internationalism to Congress and the public.
Reflecting his pro-business conservatism, he told a group of Omaha mortgage bankers, "Foreign policy is not some theoretical, esoteric, Kissinger-esque thing hanging out there. It's foreign trade."
As crises from Kosovo to Pakistan threaten stability, Mr. Hagel says, "now is the time for America to project its leadership."
In less than 18 months, Senator Hagel has helped broker a deal among his colleagues for approval of $18 billion in new financing for the International Monetary Fund. He forged an unusual alliance with Senator Robert C. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat, to counter the Administration's backing of a treaty to combat global warming. And Mr. Hagel, an Army veteran twice wounded in Vietnam, has fought against the Pentagon's use of antipersonnel land mines.
"I don't think I know of any freshman senator since I've been here who's done better work than he has," Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader and a longtime friend of Mr. Hagel's, said in an interview.
Mr. Hagel has earned a reputation as a blunt consensus-builder who is willing to reach out to Democrats to cut a deal. "He's conservative," said Senator Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who drafted a health insurance bill with Mr. Hagel. "But he's not one of the fire-breathing, steely ideologues."
Senator Hagel has also shown that he is not afraid to buck fellow conservatives on international security issues. He was an early supporter last year of the treaty to ban the use and production of poison gas, despite stiff opposition from rightist groups.
Mr. Lott credits Mr. Hagel with influencing his decision to back the chemical weapons treaty. "When I was getting really criticized by some of my own people," Mr. Lott said, "Hagel gave me a handwritten note that said: 'Don't let the ankle-biters get you down. Do what's right, and I'm with you.' "
Mr. Hagel has his critics -- particularly environmentalists who oppose his position on the global warming treaty. "Hagel seems to be a new leader of the head-in-the-sand crowd on Capitol Hill who want to ignore critical environmental problems," said Gene Karpinski, executive director of United States Public Interest Research Group.
The Senator started his political career in the early 1970's as an aide to Representative John Y. McCollister, a Nebraska Republican. There he struck up some valuable friendships: another young House aide named Trent Lott, and a young Republican Congressman, Thad Cochran, now the senior Senator from Mississippi.
During Ronald Reagan's Presidency, Mr. Hagel served as deputy administrator of the Veterans Administration and was an influential backer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Leaving Government, he became a founder of what grew into a large cellular telephone company, Vanguard Cellular Systems.
In the emerging cell-phone business, and in consulting work later, Mr. Hagel became an outspoken supporter of free trade, installing cellular systems in Costa Rica, Saudi Arabia and Britain. He puts his net worth at about $6 million.
A long-shot candidate for the Senate in 1996, he upset the popular Democratic Governor, Ben Nelson. With his military and overseas-trade background, he took aim at his first committee choice: Foreign Relations.
"It wasn't hard to get," said Mr. Hagel, who is chairman of the International Economic Policy, Export and Trade Promotion Subcommittee. "No one wanted to be on Foreign Relations."
From his sometimes lonely bully pulpit on the committee, he has criticized the Clinton Administration and its national security policies.
"I'm not sure the President has ever had a philosophy about foreign policy or thought through what role the United States should have in the world," he said. "The Administration's foreign policy has been to ricochet from crisis to crisis."
Mr. Hagel's biggest challenge was shepherding the $18 billion financing for the I.M.F. through a skeptical Senate, a task Mr. Lott assigned him. Mr. Hagel learned a lesson in Senate hardball when opponents of the financing went around him to attach conditions that would have killed a delicate compromise.
He enlisted a powerful ally, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, to restore the original deal. The financing passed, 84 to 16, but the House has bottled up the package.
Back in Nebraska, Mr. Hagel finds support for the I.M.F. among big exporters like Valmont Industries, an irrigation equipment and lighting pole manufacturer in the town of Valley. For these executives, the $18 billion for the I.M.F. is not even an issue.
"If not the I.M.F., who would do it?" asked Mogens C. Bay, chairman of Valmont. "The United States can't do it alone."

HEADLINE: Martinsville Journal;
Candy Bar, And Skills, Aid County In Job Hunt

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: MARTINSVILLE, Va., June 3

 BODY:
By all accounts, Jermelle Penn and Carolyn Hopkins have almost nothing in common. Jermelle is a 9-year-old third grader at Irisburg Elementary School. Ms. Hopkins is a 40-year-old machine technician at the Du Pont nylon plant.
Although they have never met, they are linked through profound changes under way throughout southern Virginia's Henry County, where economic reliance on furniture making and textiles is steadily giving way to uncertainty. 
 Like countless other regions around the country, Henry County, an area south of Roanoke near the North Carolina border, is moving toward the future by fits and starts. Factory closings here as a result of corporate mergers and cost-cutting measures have become common for nearly a decade, putting hundreds of people out of work. The Du Pont plant, which opened in 1941 and once employed as many as 5,000 workers, is the latest, with a planned shutdown at the end of the month. But in a way, that was the last straw.
Rather than watch another manufacturing site turn hollow, this one costing almost 450 jobs and as much as $1.4 million a year in taxes, county officials have embarked on an ambitious program to shape the future for Jermelle, Ms. Hopkins and thousands of others in the region.
And much of the effort depends on a candy bar.
With an eye toward the rapidly growing technology centers of northern Virginia, where companies cannot find enough skilled employees to fill jobs, Henry County won permission of the Nestle Company to use a likeness of its Oh Henry! chocolate bar in a promotional campaign that sings the praises of the county.
In recent advertisements in The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal and in promotional mailings, a picture of an Oh Henry! bar in its colorful wrapper is followed by the tagline, "We're hungry for work."
"We've known for about two years that Du Pont was closing," said Benny Summerlin, deputy county administrator. "We had to figure out a way to soften the blow, how to market the site."
Henry County is more than hungry for work. It is famished. Nearly every economic indicator shows that the county is lagging behind the state and the country as the local manufacturing base shrinks and the population slowly falls -- to 56,001 in July 1997 from 57,654 in 1980. Perhaps more telling is the rise in median age -- to 35.3 in 1990 from 30.6 in 1980 -- a trend that suggests younger people are leaving to find work elsewhere, cutting into the regional tax base.
The county is also grappling with an embarrassingly low percentage of people with high school degrees: 53.9 percent, compared with 75.2 percent for Virginia and the country.
' "Our goal is to reduce that to 20 percent," Mr. Summerlin said.
Since starting the Oh Henry! promotion, an $85,000 campaign financed by the county, the city of Martinsville and Du Pont, county officials say they have received a small number of telephone inquiries.
But attracting new employers is only part of the strategy. The rest involves efforts to prepare county residents by teaching them skills that new companies might require.
For schoolchildren like Jermelle, that meant a decision by the county to spend $362,000 a year to give every child in the fourth and eighth grade, starting in September, a laptop computer to keep through high school.
It also meant helping people like Ms. Hopkins, a Du Pont employee for the last 19 years, by working with the Patrick Henry Community College in Martinsville to create a curriculum that will help match graduates to the local job market. In addition, the county is allocating $280,000 a year to expand adult education classes in the public schools.
"We finally decided, there's been enough talk -- let's have some action," said Joanne B. Whitley, dean of academic and student development at the community college.
While it remains too early to gauge the success of the county's efforts, optimism abounds. In a visit today to Irisburg Elementary School, J. David Martin, the division superintendent of public schools, showed Jermelle one of the new laptops that fourth graders will get in the fall.
"It's neat," Jermelle said, wide-eyed. "It could help me with some math, reading and my language skills."
Mr. Martin dropped it on the floor to demonstrate its durability. Jermelle looked aghast, then smiled to discover that it was unharmed.
"Made out of the same material they make motorcycle helmets," Mr. Martin said.
"Cool!" Jermelle exclaimed.
At the Du Pont plant, Ms. Hopkins and two co-workers, Kay Handy, 43, and Pheobie Gravely, 51, talked about life after manufacturing.
"I have a positive outlook," Ms. Hopkins said as the others nodded. "I'm looking at the closing as an opportunity for schooling and preparing myself for something in the medical field. I'm hopeful, but if something doesn't happen, Martinsville is going to go down to nothing. Something needs to be done to bring some good jobs into the area."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
A Breaker of Molds Now Tries to Fit In

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ASK Newt Gingrich to name a Speaker of the House who ran for President and, ever the historian, he will immediately say Henry Clay.
That, of course, was before the Civil War. But Mr. Gingrich has defied historical trends; he helped break the Democrats' half century of control over the House. And signs persist -- like his recent pledge before the Israeli Parliament to support Jerusalem as the capital of Israel -- that the 54-year-old Georgian is considering a bid for the Republican Presidential nomination in 2000. 
 Some might call the idea nothing short of delusional. Mr. Gingrich still faces an ethics complaint relating to benefits he may have received from Gopac, the Republican political action committee. And while his public standing has improved, aides in his press office groaned when a recent ABC News survey flashed onto a television screen showing that only 37 percent of those polled thought that the Speaker was honest and trustworthy, compared to the 38 percent who credited the embattled President Clinton with those attributes.
 
A Core of Supporters
In addition, Mr. Gingrich's brand of eclectic, activist conservatism fits no distinct Republican mold. Moderates shy from his confrontational tactics, while House conservatives tried to oust him last year as too accommodationist. Party pragmatists consider him too unpredictable and undisciplined.
Still, Mr. Gingrich has fervent supporters among Republican grass-roots campaigners and small donors. And should he choose to jump into a crowded primary field, he would, his strategists say, do well precisely because in a race full of niche candidates he would not be limited to any of his party's distinct constituencies.
"There are buckets full of every pond that Newt can dip into and scoop out support," said Rich Galen, a Gingrich ally who now heads Gopac, which Mr. Gingrich once ran.
Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the Christian Coalition who is now a consultant, agreed: "Newt's constituency is not a piece of the pie. It's more like cake icing. It's spread evenly throughout the party."
The conventional wisdom, reasserted after Bob Dole's loss to Bill Clinton, is that a legislative leader is a bad Presidential candidate. A Speaker risks being defined not by his own positions but by the legislation his majority passes. And the making of laws, especially in a feuding, fractious House, is messy.
But in some ways Mr. Gingrich's dual roles, as a Speaker seeking to broaden his Congressional majority and as a candidate needing a wider constituency, fit together. They encourage him to be an apostle of a Big Tent Republican Party.
The Speaker's close colleagues say it is in the "center-right" of the Republican Party that Mr. Gingrich feels most comfortable -- not with the social conservatives but a few notches over with the economic conservatives. He is a tax cutter who believes government should invest in science, technology and highways.
Several Republicans define his core constituents as the fans of Rush Limbaugh who are probably anti-abortion but more interested in pocketbook issues. They are the county commissioners, salespeople and small-business owners who were the movement conservatives before the religious right loomed so large in the Republican Party. "Those who like Newt the most remember him when he was fighting to get the majority," said Don Fierce, a Republican strategist. "They remember when he came up with the Contract With America idea."
"In a funny way, Newt can cut across party lines pretty well," he added. Other Republicans point out that when conservatives tried to oust Mr. Gingrich from his post, his base of support became committee chairmen and moderates.
But watching him construct his brand of Republicanism can be like staring at a de Kooning canvas. It's bold and eye catching, but it's also hard to discern the pattern. One day, over objections from conservatives, Mr. Gingrich is pushing through the House a bill to allow a referendum on Puerto Rican statehood. A few months later, to the dismay of moderates, he is aligning with the Christian Coalition and promising to cut off funds for the National Endowment for the Arts.
Setting himself apart from Mr. Clinton and appealing to Jewish voters, he recently called Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright an agent of the Palestinians, and in a speech before the Israeli Parliament parted with American policy on Jerusalem. But days later, he popped up in Bosnia to support America's mission there.
Some House Republicans say Mr. Gingrich is trying to balance his needs for the Congressional elections this year with the Presidential election in 2000. "The constituency for '98 we are most concerned about this very minute is the hard right that we need to have not angry with us," one House Republican said. "He's playing to that group today but trying to do it without antagonizing the left-righters he needs for 2000."
Mr. Gingrich's confidantes say he is focused only on 1998, aware he has no future if he does not keep the House majority. If this year's election imperatives require him to ditch the high-toned policy speech he began the year with so he can sharpen a partisan confrontation, which might also drive up his personal negatives, so be it.
Mr. Gingrich says he will not decide whether to run for President until Labor Day of 1999. Critical in his decision is whether his wife, Marianne, is comfortable with a Presidential bid. Unlike other candidates, he has not put operatives into early primary states.
 
A Certain Luxury
Unlike others, Mr. Gingrich's star power, fund-raising base and speaking ability give him the luxury to make a decision late in the game.
"A lot of candidates will be able to raise $10 million, which is the threshold just to run," said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. "Only a few -- maybe a half dozen -- reach the $20 million threshold to carry all the way through. More than $20 million makes you truly credible. And Gingrich's Gopac, and his fund-raising capability, is truly incredible."

The Politics of Embarrassment in Alabama

BYLINE: By HOWELL RAINES 

 BODY:
Alone among the states of its region, Alabama has not fully turned the New South corner. The main reason for that and for the state's obsessive concern with its national image is its habit of electing governors who expose the state to ridicule. George Wallace fashioned this inferiority complex into a personal political asset with his defiant cry of "Stand Up for Alabama." But even the people who loved Mr. Wallace were humiliated by his ketchup-splattered shirts and masticated cigars. Yet like members of a dysfunctional family, enlightened Alabamians usually kept quiet around outsiders when it came to their feelings of shame and their secret longing for a governor who did not come across as a racist ranter or a corrupt rube.
That tradition of silent shame may have changed on Wednesday when Winton Blount 3d, having won a spot in the Republican gubernatorial runoff, celebrated his victory by saying the E-word. The state's most pressing need, he declared, is a "Governor that won't continually embarrass us." Fob James, the incumbent Governor, responded by suggesting that Mr. Blount was a "fat monkey." 
 Mr. James's argument that he is "every bit a gentleman" is weakened by his record. He once did an ape imitation before the State Board of Education. He announced that the Bill of Rights does not apply in Alabama. His family owns a landfill that does business with the state, and he wants to grant his son the right to build a private toll bridge. When he welcomes visiting dignitaries, Mr. James often has the rumpled look of a man who slept in his car. All this led The Birmingham News, which is generally kind to Republican incumbents, to editorialize that "Blount's right: James is an embarrassment."
As a native Alabamian with a deep affection for my home state, I salute Mr. Blount for getting the issue of embarrassing governors out in the open and The News for supporting him. This is a terribly important election because it gives Alabama a chance to embark on the journey toward basic economic and educational reform that began in Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi and Florida almost 30 years ago.
Alabama's contrasting lack of progress can be linked directly to its penchant for electing buffoons. Because of the structure of state politics, only a progressive governor can change things. The Legislature is paralyzed by the gambling, timber and trial-lawyer lobbies. The revenue system is a joke, having been tailored by Northern corporations to avoid paying fair taxes on their Alabama holdings. The education budget is sapped by scores of redundant junior colleges, trade schools and faux universities that Mr. Wallace set up as patronage mills. The state's chief asset, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, was built with Federal dollars. Its most important industrial facility, a Mercedes plant near Tuscaloosa, was lured into the state during the years between Mr. James's two terms.
In those terms, Mr. James has established himself as a contender for worst governor of the century, but it will be a hard title to nail down. Mr. Wallace, by virtue of allowing unprosecuted racial violence and a culture of endemic corruption in Montgomery, will probably win. But you've also got to consider Big Jim Folsom's public drunkenness and the hayseed machinations of Guy Hunt, elected in 1986 as the first Republican Governor since Reconstruction. Mr. Hunt used the state plane to deliver him to preaching engagements and set a new standard for rustic manners, conversion of campaign funds to personal use and lack of meaningful knowledge about state business.
Mr. James seems equally devoid of public-policy expertise, but has been more aggressive in showing it. His record has defied any rational analysis. He first won election in 1978 by campaigning in a school bus as the symbol of his promise to improve education. But for the last four years he has kept the state in chaos by arguing that Alabama, which ranks near the bottom of every educational index, is spending too much on education. He is widely regarded as less interested in improving the state than in his wife's apocalyptic religious theories. She, by the way, called Mr. Blount a "big, fat sissy."
Mr. Blount, who is 54 and the son of a former Postmaster General, is only nine years younger than Mr. James, but he represents a new generation in Alabama politics. So does the Democratic nominee, Lieut. Gov. Don Siegelman. If Mr. Blount can defeat Governor James in the June 30 runoff, he will face Mr. Siegelman in November. Then, for the first time in living memory, Alabama will have a choice between two progressive candidates whose public appearances will be occasions of pride rather than dread.

HEADLINE: Census Takers Will Try Out New Method In California

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., June 4

 BODY:
Cindy Jumper pulled her blue Toyota to the curb in front of a gray frame house on a quiet street. She could hardly contain her excitement. "Great," she said out loud to herself. "The door's open."
A jumble of children's toys scattered about the front porch indicated that someone did live here. The wide-open front door indicated more: that this time, unlike the last time Ms. Jumper had visited, the occupants were at home. A knock brought forth a slender woman with short, dark hair, a small boy and a roly-poly black-and-white puppy. The woman was soon answering Ms. Jumper's questions on a census form. 
 While Republicans and Democrats 3,000 miles away argue the legality and the merits of the Census Bureau's plan to change the way it will conduct the country's head count in 2000, the bureau is quietly -- and, it says, successfully -- testing that new method in California's ethnically and economically diverse capital city.
Since the beginning of April, temporary Census Bureau employees like Ms. Jumper have fanned out across Sacramento, interviewing residents in households that did not return the forms mailed to them in early March. But the number of households that will be visited is different in Sacramento than it has been in any previous census.
This river city of about 374,000 is one of three sites where the bureau is conducting its dress rehearsals for the next census. Unlike the other two -- an Indian reservation near Menominee, Wis., and 14 counties in and around Columbia, S.C. -- it is being used for a large-scale test of a method called statistical sampling, which will be used to estimate the size and characteristics of its population.
Following the procedure that has been used in every census since 1970 and will be used again in 2000, the bureau mailed forms to households in the Sacramento test asking them to provide information on the age, sex, race, marital status and income of every resident. But in previous years census takers, known at the bureau as enumerators, were sent, repeatedly if necessary, to each residence that failed to mail back the form. In contrast, the enumerators in the Sacramento test were sent only to a randomly selected sample of households in each neighborhood.
Census Bureau statisticians in Washington monitored the return rate for the forms in each of the city's census tracts, and from their findings determined how many households in each tract would receive a visit from an enumerator.
If half the houses sent back their forms, census takers would have to get interviews from four out of every five of the remaining households. If 70 percent responded, they would have to visit two out of every three. From that sample, statisticians plan to extrapolate the size and makeup of all the households that failed to mail back their forms.
The bureau hopes the new method will reduce the cost of taking the census and improve on the accuracy of the 1990 results. That year's count, the bureau has admitted, missed more than 10 million people, mainly blacks in the inner cities and Hispanic residents in Texas, New Mexico and California. It also double-counted an additional 6 million people, mainly college students and affluent whites who own more than one home.
Republicans have attacked the bureau's plans, contending that they violate instructions laid out in the Constitution on how the census is to be conducted every 10 years. Since many of those who were missed in 1990 tend to live in solidly Democratic districts, Republican strategists privately fear that a more accurate count would give the Democrats an advantage when the data from the census is used to draw boundaries for state legislatures and the House of Representatives.
With the political stakes so high, the Sacramento test is being closely watched by the Clinton Administration and House Republicans.
As a test site, Sacramento mirrors the problems the Census Bureau experienced in 1990. Officials estimate that at least 11,400 people were missed by the 1990 tally in Sacramento. And the experiences of Ms. Jumper and other census takers illustrate how difficult -- and expensive -- it is to get a complete count.
On a gloriously sunny day, David Granados, 19, a census taker who is also a student at a local community college, walked the leafy streets of a working-class neighborhood near Sacramento High School. Fewer than 44 percent of the households in that census tract had returned their forms; he would have to get interviews from four out of every five dwellings that had not responded.
Mr. Granados was visiting many of the houses for the second or third time. When he determined that no one was home, he left a notice listing a number where he could be reached to set up an appointment.
"You just have to keep coming back five or six times and call them six times," he said. "If you don't get a response after six times, then you have to use other means."
Those other means could include asking neighbors or the local letter carrier. It could also mean finding the owner of the house by looking through land records, and asking that person if he or she knows anything about the people living there.
It was this process, undertaken for every household that did not mail back its form, that pushed up the costs of the 1990 census. The process was also blamed for many of the mistakes, since the longer it takes to gather information, the more time there is for the data to become outdated and erroneous.
There have been problems with the test here. Some Hispanic enumerators have complained that they were assigned to non-Hispanic areas, wasting their fluency in Spanish.
A special telephone number was set up so that people who speak Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Vietnamese or Mien, a Laotian dialect, could talk to someone and receive help filling out their forms. But the instructions telling callers which numbers to press were in English.
"It seems like a lot of things that were done wrong in 1990, they're doing again," said May Lee, director of the Asian Resource Center, who serves on a local advisory group recruited by the Census Bureau. "Did all the surveys and focus groups that were done after 1990 go down a black hole?"

HEADLINE: SOCCER;
Fixed Matches Are Darkening Soccer's Image

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 6

 BODY:
Last November, as the United States prepared for a World Cup soccer qualifying match against El Salvador, John Harkes and Roy Wegerle, two of the team's top players, received an alarming telephone call at their hotel in Providence, R.I. The caller suggested that they could make money by throwing their game against El Salvador.
The players reported the anonymous call to Coach Steve Sampson, but never determined whether it was a serious bribe attempt or a prank. 
 While the Americans were disturbed, they were not entirely surprised. Nor was anyone else involved in international soccer.
"There is enough proof in the past, not necessarily at the World Cup, but at the club level, that these things have taken place," Mr. Sampson said of soccer and fixed matches. "Referees have been bribed and players have been given incentives to throw matches."
This week, the World Cup, the 32-team tournament and ultimate championship in the world's most popular sport, will start, and with it will come celebrations of soccer's ability to galvanize national pride and transfix the globe. A television audience of 37 billion over the 33 days is expected. But in virtually every corner of that captivated globe, a darker side of soccer has worsened in recent years -- a dispiriting underside disfigured by tales of lucrative gambling rings, rigged results and a pervasive erosion of trust. In the last year alone, allegations of fixed matches in domestic club leagues have been investigated in Russia, China, Greece, Israel, Belgium and Vietnam, all coming as the economy of soccer -- experts estimate it as a $400 billion-a-year industry -- grows more enormous.
In Bulgaria, the Government announced last month that it was assuming control of the national soccer federation because of widespread corruption and incompetence. Last November in Greece, 123 members of Parliament backed a public statement concluding that "championships in all divisions and team standings" were being "cooked up in backstage deals."
Two months ago, Pavel Sadyrin, who coached Russia's 1994 World Cup team, told the national soccer federation that "there were, still are, and, alas, always will be, rigged matches as long as the country does not follow the rule of law."
And in Vietnam, fans are infuriated over concerns that bookmakers, through bribes to players and referees, are fixing club league games. The Vietnamese soccer federation recently refused to validate the score of a match between teams from Hanoi and Haiphong because of widespread suspicions of rigging.
"Our players have to relearn the spirit of sport and understand that we don't play matches using deceit," Nguyen Tai Ngo, a member of Vietnam's committee for sports and gymnastics, said in an Agence France-Presse report.
"These are merely reflections of the vastly increasing richness of the game," Paul Gardner, a columnist for the magazine Soccer America and one of the foremost authorities on the sport in the United States, said of the spread of game-fixing scandals. "There is an obscene amount of money in the game."
While there has never been a confirmed fixing scandal in the World Cup, the rash of recent investigations has prompted FIFA, soccer's world governing body, to install safeguards before the start of the tournament on Wednesday. For example, teams and the 67 referees involved in the tournament will stay in secure hotels or on isolated floors of hotels, theoretically apart from danger.
"Of course this is a matter of concern, but we are not expecting serious problems," Michel Zen-Ruffinen, FIFA's deputy executive director, said of the prospect of a scandal. "There would be serious sanctions taken. We expect people to be aware that it is not worth destroying a career to accept money. We believe the pride of playing for a country is stronger than the desire to receive money."
Over the years, though, the World Cup has not been immune from problems -- both real bribe attempts and suspicious matches.
A Costa Rican referee, Rodrigo Badilla, was suspended from the 1998 World Cup, Mr. Zen-Ruffinen said, for failing to sufficiently report a $50,000 bribe attempt to fix a qualifying match last October between Japan and the United Arab Emirates. Mr. Badilla, who refereed the 1994 World Cup in the United States, hung up on the caller who mentioned the bribe, and he was not suspected of having tainted the match, Mr. Zen-Ruffinen said. However, Mr. Badilla reported the matter only to another referee and not to FIFA officials, Mr. Zen-Ruffinen said.
This was the only reported case of attempting to bribe a referee in 700 qualifying matches for the 1998 World Cup, Mr. Zen-Ruffinen said.
FIFA officials are particularly sensitive to attempts to compromise the game officials because they wield enormous control in such a low-scoring sport with the right to call, or not call, penalties. Some soccer experts say they believe referees are vulnerable because their salaries have not kept up with the millions paid to top players.
Another top referee, Kurt Rothlisberger of Switzerland, who worked the 1994 World Cup and was removed after a controversial no-call on an apparent penalty during a Belgium-Germany match, was banned for life last year for allegedly demanding $60,000 to help fix a 1996 European Champion League match.
Just as worrisome to FIFA is the mere perception of rigged games.
During qualifying for the 1998 World Cup, the coach of El Salvador, Milovan Djoric, was twice suspended for contending that the referees had helped Mexico during its matches against El Salvador.
Horace Burrell, the president of the Jamaican soccer federation, threatened last fall to sue the Salvadoran federation over its suggestions that Jamaica may have offered bribes to the Salvadorans to throw a qualifying match against Jamaica in November. The Salvadorans later apologized and admitted the Jamaicans were guiltless.
A particularly disquieting incident took place in Qatar at the 1995 World Cup for players under 17 years of age. According to Mr. Zen-Ruffinen, some players had been offered gifts by men thought to be part of a Malaysian betting syndicate.
"They were not asking the players to do something in exchange," Mr. Zen-Ruffinen said, adding that the players had allowed the men to take photographs. "The idea, most surely, was to use the pictures at a later stage when these players became famous, presumably in a case of extortion or something like that."
In one preventive measure, match assignments for referees at this World Cup will be handed out with little advance notice, and referees traveling to matches will be accompanied by security guards.
"I have never been approached," said Esse Baharmast, the lone American referee assigned to this World Cup. "If there is a strange phone call coming in, the first thing I would do is go to the authorities."
Mr. Sampson, the American coach, said he understood the need for the precautions. "I'm not really concerned about it, but I don't want to be naive," he said. "When so much is at stake financially for individuals and for countries, when literally the image of an entire nation is resting on the results of how a team fares in the World Cup, there is bound to be at least the perception that there will be those kind of incidents."
Soccer experts say that there is nothing inherently corrupt about the game, but rather that corruption in soccer is reflective of the money and popularity of the sport and consistent with the corruption found at many levels in many countries.
With widespread television exposure, soccer also has become hugely popular for bettors. In Thailand, where two men were given three-month sentences in May for operating an illegal soccer betting racket, a research center estimated that $1 billion would be bet in that country alone during the World Cup.
Last January, 12 of China's top clubs said in a newspaper survey that they had offered cash bribes to referees, some of whom had accepted. In April, two soccer players were arrested in Vietnam for fixing league matches last year, and published reports said up to 74 players and team officials were suspected of rigging games. And the Italian Parliament was suspended on April 29 when a scuffle broke out among elected officials over the credibility of the refereeing in a match that had significant implications for the Italian season.
A match-fixing scandal at the 1998 World Cup would be a painful embarrassment for the French, who suffered through the most notorious example of match-fixing in recent years. Bernard Tapie, the former French Urban Affairs Minister, was sentenced to a year in prison in 1995 for fixing a 1993 match involving the team he owned, Olympic Marseilles.
In the last two decades, two World Cup matches have aroused suspicion of rigging. In 1978, Argentina needed a four-goal victory over Peru to advance ahead of Brazil -- total goals counted in the formula for advancement -- and into the final against Holland. When Argentina won, 6-0, Brazilian reporters noted that the Peruvian goalkeeper, Ramon Quiroga, was a native of Argentina. Mr. Quiroga has continued to deny any foul play. FIFA has since changed the tournament format to single elimination after the first round.
In the 1982 World Cup, a 1-0 victory by West Germany over Austria sent those two teams to the second round on goal differential ahead of Algeria. West Germany scored early, and neither team made any real effort to score again. To avoid this situation again, FIFA now schedules all final games in the first round at the same time, so teams cannot know in advance how many goals will get them to the next round.
Alan I. Rothenberg, president of the United States Soccer Federation, said he doubted games would be thrown at the 1998 World Cup.
"Maybe I'm the classic, naive American," he said, "but I believe when players step on the field, they play hard and want to win."

HEADLINE: Giuliani's Foster Care Plan Faces a Political Minefield

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
New York City treats its foster care system like a slot machine, a child welfare commissioner complained in the mid-1970's: it pours in money and hopes for the best.
Since then, would-be reformers inside and outside city government have tried to turn the hundreds of millions of dollars the city spends yearly on foster care contracts into a force for controlled improvement, rather than a gamble with the lives of abused and neglected children. 
 A plan to refocus the system along community district lines and put the pieces up for bid, announced by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani last week, is the most sweeping effort in almost 20 years to change the way the city does business with the private, nonprofit agencies that care for most children in foster care.
On the surface, the plan seems to concern uncomplicated shifts in social work philosophy -- delivering services to children in their neighborhoods rather than dispersing them throughout the region. But underneath, it presents a minefield of power politics and patronage in a city where racial, religious and ethnic interests have historically clashed over children as they battled for a bigger share of public money and social clout.
Foster care has long been a key source of both. Last year 23 of the 50 biggest city contractors were foster care agencies, and 10 of them alone handled about half the city's $614 million foster care budget, according to an analysis by Child Welfare Watch, an independent publication. Most of the 10 are at least 100 years old and have well-established influence at City Hall through their ties to the city's major religious leadership and through trustees and boards drawn from the city's business establishment. Newer, smaller, agencies include minority-run programs started through state grants in the 1980's and nurtured under the Dinkins administration.
The last overhaul comparable to the one detailed Wednesday by Nicholas Scoppetta, Commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services, was acclaimed in 1979 as a revolution. But after a promising start, it was derailed by the pressures of city politics, economic downturns and roller-coaster shifts in the city's foster care population. Regardless of the value of neighborhood-based services, how much difference the new plan makes will ultimately depend on whether Mr. Scoppetta can safely steer it through such pitfalls.
Politics will inevitably be part of the scramble for the $614 million pot the plan opens to redivision. The change presents the possibility of new jobs and public money in neighborhoods riven by ethnic rivalries, and the expansion or contraction of institutions with major campaign contributors on their boards.
Last week's unveiling of a system redesign came six weeks before the scheduled start of trial in Marisol v. Giuliani, a class-action lawsuit brought late in 1995 by Children's Rights Inc., a national nonprofit children's advocacy organization. The Federal lawsuit aims at all aspects of the city child welfare system, from child-abuse investigations through foster care, and asks that a receiver be given full authority to restructure the city's Administration for Children's Services on behalf of more than 100,000 children. The city's position has been that Mr. Scoppetta's changes make this lawsuit and other pending litigation against the agency a dead letter if not a hindrance.
Mr. Scoppetta's plan envisions a neighborhood-based child welfare system reminiscent of the old settlement house model. It is based on a longstanding social work consensus, honored far more in the breach than the observance, that children should be placed close to home. Under the plan, contractors are to be held responsible for serving children and families in one community, supporting them with a range of linked services, including health care, counseling and drug treatment as well as foster care. Agencies that fail to improve outcomes for children would risk losing their city contracts.
But veterans of the city's foster care wars, while admiring the ambition of Mr. Scoppetta's effort, have not forgotten lessons from the past.
In 1979, the Board of Estimate, then the powerful budgetary arm of New York City government, outlawed the automatic contract renewals and rate increases that had become common for foster care agencies and adopted measurable performance standards. One of the standards detailed in the resulting program assessment system was children's placement in their home borough. That was a less ambitious geographical requirement than the one in Mr. Scoppetta's plan, yet the city abandoned it in 1985 as soon as foster beds fell short of need. Today only 6 percent of the 42,000 children in foster care reside in their own community district, though nearly every district has enough foster families to accommodate the foster children it originates.
Many other requirements detailed in contracts fell by the wayside in the late 1980's as the balance of power between the agencies and the city shifted with the rising number of children pouring into care. Fueled by deepening poverty, homelessness, AIDS and crack, the foster care population rose from a low of 17,000 in 1985 to almost 50,000 in 1991. That year, the assessment system was eliminated in budget cuts.
"The moment the numbers exploded, the message to the city was, you can be assessing people until you're blue in the face -- who cares when you're using every bed they have?" Steven Cohen, who oversaw the city's contract relations with the agencies until 1985, once explained. "You can't regulate anything when the suppliers control the market."
The most dramatic show of contractor clout came over church precepts. When John Cardinal O'Connor publicly threatened to end his archdiocese's role in the foster care system, the city chose not to enforce a contract requirement that teen-agers have access to family planning.
The Mayor then, Edward I. Koch, quickly repudiated the court-ordered consent decree that mandated such services, though it had been negotiated by his own corporation counsel. Potentially at stake were not only a quarter of the city's foster care beds, but Roman Catholic votes in a difficult election year.
In an interview last week, Mr. Scoppetta was impatient with references to past failures. "I don't know that there's ever been a concerted effort to do it the way we're doing it," he said. "Agencies were not really held accountable. Isn't it time to change that?"
But children's advocates are concerned about the city's own accountability. For more than a decade the city has been under judicial order to promptly evaluate children who come into city custody and to place them in the best program available for their needs. Last year no more than 6 percent of children placed had timely initial evaluations, according to city data. Hit-or-miss telephone brokerage has remained the city's dominant method of placing children, in part because it still lacks the computer capacity to find vacancies accurately.
As recently as 1996, for example, Spanish-speaking children from Sunset Park in Brooklyn were assigned by the city to foster families in Harlem who spoke no Spanish, despite vacancies in their own neighborhood linked to the Center for Family Life, a national model of the kind of community services network that Mr. Scoppetta is trying to create citywide.
"I credit them for their aspirations," said Marcia Robinson Lowry, director of Children's Rights Inc. "What is dangerous here is if they want to declare victory and go home."

France Says It Is Ready To Step In on Airline Strike
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France said his Government was ready to step in and push Air France pilots and management to settle a strike that has grounded most of the airline's flights just as hundreds of thousands of soccer fans begin pouring into the country for the World Cup soccer tournament, which starts Wednesday. The strike began last Monday, and negotiations broke off early yesterday morning. 10
 
Hope Dim on Africa's Horn
President Isaias Afewerki of Eritrea said he held out little hope of peace with Ethiopia as the two countries continued their border war on the Horn of Africa. As both sides shot down aircraft in fighting, Ethiopia said it would cease attacks for 13 hours to allow foreigners to leave Asmara, its rival's capital. 8
 
Serbs Continue Kosovo Attacks
Serbian security forces continued their assault against Albanian separatists in the province of Kosovo in western Yugoslavia. The fighting occurred as President Clinton was expected to decide on Monday whether to reimpose sanctions on the Serbs for the violence against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, who are fighting for independence from Serbia. 8
 
Germ Threat From Iraq
A new book reports that just before the start of the 1991 Persian Gulf war the American military discovered that Iraqi soldiers had immunity to anthrax, heightening fears that Baghdad was preparing to wage germ warfare. The book, by the investigative reporter Seymour M. Hersh, says the finding helped accelerate the Pentagon's crash program that led to the vaccination of some 150,000 soldiers before the war. 6

Major Failures Reported On Air and Water Laws
Widespread failures by Federal and local officials in several states to police even the most basic requirements of the nation's clean air and water laws have been documented by the inspector general of the Environmental Protection Agency. In a series of reports, the environmental agency's independent auditing arm blames both Federal and state officials for the shortcomings. 1
 
Starr's Other Pursuit
Kenneth W. Starr's effort to bring White House aides and Secret Service agents before his grand jury has provided much of the recent legal drama in Washington. But it is his pursuit of notes from a lawyer's interview with a man who has been dead nearly five years that, of all the disputes surrounding the independent counsel's investigation, could ultimately matter most to anyone who has ever consulted a lawyer about a potentially embarrassing problem. 1
 
Poor County Turns to Candy Bar
Officials in Virginia's Henry County, one of that state's poorest, rather than watch another manufacturing site turn hollow, have embarked on an ambitious program to shape the future for thousands of young and old in the region. And much of the effort depends on a candy bar. 16
 
Quiet Test for Census Bureau
While Republicans and Democrats argue the legality and the merits of the Census Bureau's plan to change the way it will conduct the country's head count in the year 2000, the bureau is quietly -- and, it says, successfully -- testing that new method in California's ethnically and economically diverse capital city, Sacramento. 22

HEADLINE: HEALTH CARE COMES HOME: A special report.;
Families Provide Medical Care, Tubes and All

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
Dorothy Knight has dressed up her son's ventilator with three Mickey Mouse stickers, but there is no hiding the hospital in her house. A tank of oxygen sits by the crib, a few feet from the machine that tracks 2-year-old Jimmy's heart rate and blood oxygen while he sleeps.
She is casual about her dual role as mother and nurse, yet it is still unsettling when she flips on a little electric pump -- dug out from a pile of toys -- sticks a catheter through the tracheotomy tube in Jimmy's throat, then suctions out the excess mucus. 
 "We do it in the middle of the mall," said Ms. Knight, who lives with her husband, another son and a daughter in Hicksville, on Long Island.
It is a noble and almost old-fashioned notion that families like the Knights would care for their son, whose brain does not emit the signals for him to breathe properly while he sleeps, at home. They would have it no other way.
But like millions of families across the nation, the Knights find themselves in the midst of what many experts say is a fundamental shift in health care: families are performing an unprecedented amount of technical medical care in their homes, much of which would once have been provided by doctors or nurses alone. And while that shift can be beneficial for both patients and family, it has placed a growing burden on family members, whose traditional role has been much more oriented toward providing comfort than actual care.
The causes are many, even if the effects or any concrete idea of what to do about them remain largely unexplored. Technology has made even complicated treatments possible at home, from dialysis to chemotherapy to intravenous feeding or antibiotics. People are living longer and can require years of care in their homes, often from adult children with jobs and children of their own.
And in this age of managed care, the intense pressure to reduce health care costs has reduced the number of people admitted to hospitals and shortened hospital stays, which means more care is being administered by family members who are unpaid and, in many cases, untrained and unprepared for what is newly expected of them.
Ms. Knight lists her own troubles: a shortage of money and sleep, worry over endlessly beeping equipment, battles with insurance companies and a marriage that, she says flatly, has been worn to the edge of divorce.
"It's a quantum leap for the responsibilities of families," said Carol Levine, a medical ethicist in New York City who recently completed one of the few comprehensive studies of family caregiving through the United Hospital Fund. "It's not just that you are asked to do a little bit more. It's a whole different set of responsibilities."
Ms. Levine knows her subject well. In January 1990, she and her husband, Howard, then 61, were in a car accident in upstate New York that left him largely paralyzed and with severe brain damage. As she worked to reconstruct their lives, she became overwhelmed by practicalities, from ordering supplies -- which often involved battles with bureaucracy -- to finding a new apartment and renovating it to accommodate a wheelchair. She also struggled with her metamorphosis from wife to home nurse, with little help from doctors, insurance companies or the government.
"There was something basic not happening here, and I couldn't believe I was the only one who felt that way," she said.
Ms. Levine's contention -- echoed by a rising chorus of voices in business, medicine and academics -- is that the role of family caregivers has been largely dismissed as one that families are expected to undertake, willingly and lovingly.
But, she maintains, the entire spectrum of caregiving -- from specialized technical care to the grueling and emotional haul of caring for a chronically ill relative -- needs to be re-evaluated. For years, the growing elderly population and the shrinking number of people in nursing homes have implied a greater responsibility on the part of family members, even as changes in Medicare and Medicaid and financial controls by managed care companies have made it harder to get professional care in the home.
The health care system, though, has not fully adjusted to the growing role of families, she says. And she contends that if the health care system benefits financially from the shift, it also has a new obligation to pay greater attention to family caregivers, at least through better training and more respect for their work.
To the small extent that caregiving has been discussed by politicians, many policy makers have been reluctant to take on the possibility of more direct help -- like tax credits -- which they see as a hugely expensive undertaking.
But the issue is being tackled piecemeal around the country: employers are beginning to offer more flexible schedules; medical schools are rotating residents through homes; hospitals are increasingly training families for their duties after patients are discharged; states like California and Pennsylvania have established programs -- debated in Washington but never passed -- for "respite care," or a sporadic few hours of paid home nursing to give families a rest.
And many experts say the needs will only grow in the coming years, as technology becomes ever more sophisticated and the baby boomers age, with demographically fewer of their own children to care for them.
"Wait till they get old," said James B. Weil, a vice president at Metropolitan Life, who has studied the economic impact of caregiving on business. "We haven't seen anything yet."
 
The Shift Home
Numerous Factors Help Trend Take Off
 The move toward care at home has been building for many years, but a pivotal moment came in 1981, when President Ronald Reagan singled out a 3-year-old girl from Iowa, Katie Beckett, at a news conference. Mr. Reagan railed against Medicaid regulations that had kept Katie, who suffered from viral encephalitis, in a hospital, at a cost of $12,000 a month, rather than allow her to be cared for at home, where it would cost $4,000 or less.
Since then, the entire medical system has reoriented itself, through changes in Government rules, advances in medical machinery and family members who have demanded that their ill loved ones be cared for at home. More recently, managed care companies and hospitals conscious of the bottom line have weighed in, pushing to get patients home quicker and, many critics contend, sicker.
The result has been an explosion in family caregiving, which involves large commitments of time, for a range of chores from cooking and cleaning to more burdensome and complicated medical routines.
Last June, a poll by the National Alliance for Caregiving, a consortium of advocacy groups for the elderly, based in Washington, found that the number of people providing free care to a family member or friend grew to 21 million, up from 7 million in 1987. (That increase is considerably above the 21 percent rise in the population of people over 65 in the same period.)
The study showed that 72 percent of caregivers are women -- in Washington, caregiving is often tagged as a "woman's issue" -- and that more people are caring for relatives who do not live with them.
Few people, from family members to doctors and insurers, question that this shift has been largely for the good. Experts say there are few horror stories of people dying or becoming much sicker as a result of their care at home.
But advocates for sick people say managed care companies often turn down patients for paid home nursing, and increasingly expect family members to provide care, even in cases where family members are incapable because, for example, they live too far away or have substance abuse problems.
"What they are asking is, when do you want to take your child home, rather than, do you want to take your child home or are you able to take your child home?" said Dr. Arthur F. Kohrman, a Chicago pediatrician who has written extensively on the difficulties of caring for sick children dependent on technology. "Parents who feel they can't accomplish it, it puts them in the position of immediately being inadequate or being seen as uncaring parents."
"But," he added, "we are asking them to care way beyond the normal evidence of what a caring parent is."
And, in fact, one of the many difficulties of family caregiving is a confusing shift in family roles: children must baby their grown parents. Parents, in a wrenching exaggeration of the conflicts of normal parental roles, must at times inflict the pain and discomfort of medical procedures on the very same children they must also comfort and calm.
In an extreme example, Regina Cunningham, 41, of Lynbrook, N.Y., considered herself squeamish before her daughter, Katie, was born with intestines that did not function properly, ultimately requiring a transplant. But over the years, Ms. Cunningham has tended to drains in her daughter's stomach; wrestled with tubes in her chest and with pumps for food or antibiotics; and learned to spot infection before doctors did.
Katie, now 9, seemed perfectly healthy on a recent evening as she played with two friends and showed off her headstands. But Ms. Cunningham still must insert a catheter into Katie's bladder three times a day -- and she remains angry at what she feels was inadequate training from doctors, and is exhausted from duties that have left her with chronic back problems.
"It was very stressful," she said. "Was I doing the right thing? I really wasn't an expert. Was I doing everything that she needed?"
 
The Daily Routine
Caregivers Contend With Many Machines
 Phyllis Kaufman of Brooklyn said she, too, has had a hard time caring for her husband Jack, 70, a survivor of Auschwitz who came to New York, married her and opened a kosher butcher shop. After his second stroke in 1995, he had a feeding tube implanted in his stomach, and the machine only added to his wife's heartbreak.
Mrs. Kaufman said a nurse spent less than five minutes showing her how to use the machine in the hospital, then a home nurse tried again after her husband's discharge. But she could not make sense of exactly what she had to do, even though she was acutely aware that her husband's survival depended on it.
"You understand, I'm 64 years old," Mrs. Kaufman said. "In my time, I've never learned anything about computers. And all these buttons?
"I was terrified. Then it beeps. It makes noise. Every time it beeps, I curse the machine. I'm afraid of it. Little by little, the machine broke. Then they brought in a second one, in a different style. And I cursed that one, too.
"The second machine lasted a little longer. And the second one broke. Then they brought me the third machine."
Fortunately, she has not had to contend with a fourth. "By that time, maybe, I was a little more experienced," added Mrs. Kaufman, who later started a support group through Well Spouse, an organization for husbands and wives of the chronically ill.
Still, Mrs. Kaufman said she could never put her husband in a nursing home, and as trying as the situation is, she said it is better to have him home. Because of the advantages patients have at home -- in familiar surroundings, away from the sterile atmosphere and risk of infection in hospitals -- many cases of caregiving prove much more joyous than painful, even if families are providing care in a way that would have been unheard-of only a few years ago.
Randi Rosenberg, a 32-year-old executive in Manhattan, was recently given a diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer and underwent a lumpectomy at Beth Israel Medical Center. She was sent home the same day, by a surgeon who began advocating for same-day release on therapeutic grounds long before managed care.
As a result, her partner, Andrew Gardner, 39, was expected to collect the fluids from the drain in her wound, something rarely required of families several years ago.
"It wasn't particularly hard," said Mr. Gardner, a systems analyst who praised the hospital training. "It was a little gross."
Ms. Rosenberg said she was grateful to be able to recuperate at home, where she was visited by friends and could lounge on the roof deck of her apartment building.
"I'd rather be here than in the hospital," she said. "Your environment plays a big part in your recovery."
Gail and David Loomar of Yardley, Pa., find the push toward care in the home, which in their case requires a high level of technology, liberating. They also underscore why care at home can be easier for some: the young, people comfortable with technology or those who already have some connection with the medical system.
In 1996, Ms. Loomar, 57, was given a diagnosis of colon cancer. She now receives two types of chemotherapy, which are administered at home rather than at the hospital, where she would have had to spend hours on successive days for treatment. In one , the drugs are fed to her liver through a pump the size of a hockey puck implanted in her abdomen. In the second, the drugs are fed through a tube implanted below her left collarbone that hooks up to an external pump, which she wears in a fanny pack.
There is no maintenance for the implanted pump. But at the end of each cycle of medication, her husband, 63, who is a dentist and is accustomed to medical equipment, tends to the portable pump. Pulling the equipment from an Eddie Bauer shopping bag, he closes off the pump and flushes the tubes with a saline solution, then with an anticoagulant. With that, his duties are finished until the next round of chemotherapy.
"I say, thank God," Ms. Loomar said.
"And I go to work," Dr. Loomar said. "That's the extent of my caregiving."
 
The Future Course
Small Incentives, Not Big Programs
 It is a sign of the times that even the strongest advocates for helping caregivers talk little about ambitious programs like tax credits, more government home care or even some direct payments to families. This is true, even as some of the same experts theorize a return to greater -- and costly -- institutionalization, if the burdens on families grow too heavy as the elderly population increases.
"I wouldn't want this debate to be a debate about something that requires a major new cash infusion from the system," said James R. Tallon Jr., president of the United Hospital Fund. "That distracts people from what could be very positive steps that are well within the purview of people delivering services, people financing services, to make incremental, important changes."
Ms. Levine, Mr. Weil of Metropolitan Life, and others say those small initiatives could overcome many of the problems: better training in hospitals for caregivers; more flexibility from employers; a greater recognition from doctors and hospitals that families are a central part of a patient's care.
Already, there have been small steps: in 1993, the Family and Medical Leave Act allowed millions of employees to take up to 12 weeks unpaid leave a year. Mr. Weil has been working to persuade employers to help their workers who are caregivers. The goal is to stem the huge cost to business -- about $12 billion a year, according to a Metlife study -- through caregivers who arrive late, leave early or are too exhausted to focus on work.
On the theory that policy makers cannot focus on anything without a price tag, Ms. Levine's study estimated the economic value of caregiving, with numbers from Peter S. Arno, an economist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. Using three national studies showing the number of caregivers to adults between 23.6 million people and 27.4 million, Ms. Levine and Mr. Arno estimated the economic value of caregiving to be between $113 billion and $286 billion a year.
In comparison, total expenditures for paid home care are $30 billion a year. Nursing home care costs $79 billion a year.
At a minimum, Ms. Levine says, the numbers are big enough to prompt a deeper look at caregiving. "It's a tremendously isolating existence," she said. "And in terms of the health care system, there is a void."

HEADLINE: Death Penalty For Ex-Guard In Murder of 3

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
In the first death penalty trial since New York State reinstated capital punishment in 1995, a Brooklyn jury sentenced a former jail guard to die yesterday for murdering three people in a robbery at an illegal social club.
The former guard, Darrel K. Harris -- who was given a medal by Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1987 for saving another correction officer's life in a riot at a Brooklyn jail -- was sentenced to execution after jurors rejected defense arguments that his past heroism and other mitigating factors that were offered were reasons to spare his life. 
 When the sentence was announced in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, the 40-year-old Mr. Harris, a man with a neatly trimmed mustache and beard who wears an ear lobe stud, stared ahead without any show of emotion. Before the jury's decision was announced in the courtroom, Mr. Harris had been informed of it and did not react visibly then because "we all knew this was possible," one of his lawyers said later.
One juror began sobbing and nearly collapsed as she left the box after the panel of seven women and five men was dismissed by Acting Justice Anne G. Feldman, who thanked them for performing "this very difficult civic obligation." Another juror dabbed her eyes with her fingers.
The jury had a choice of either a death sentence or life in prison without the possibility of parole.
As mitigating factors, the defense argued that serious psychological problems and cocaine and alcohol abuse had not only caused Mr. Harris to plunge from hero in 1986 to triple killer a decade later, but had also fueled his rampage.
If Mr. Harris is executed by lethal injection, as prescribed under the law, he will be the first person put to death in the state since 1963, when the death penalty was carried out in the electric chair.
But years of legal appeals are likely.
Relatives of Mr. Harris hurried from the courtroom without talking to reporters. But his victims' relatives, some of whom wept quietly as they left the courtroom, expressed gratification at what they deemed a just penalty for the bloodletting at the after-hours spot, Club Happiness, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, in the early morning of Dec. 7, 1996.
"We got what we wanted," said Moses Sims, whose brother, Jerome, the club manager, was among the victims. "We could have dealt with life without parole, but this was our first priority," he said of the death sentence, which the jury announced after 22 hours of deliberations over four days.
"I'm relieved," said Mr. Sims, who trains prize fighters, adding that he planned to "put a flower" on the grave of his brother, who was 58 when Mr. Harris shot him in the head. Mr. Harris had ordered the five people in the club to get down on the floor as he began his robbery.
Besides Mr. Sims, Mr. Harris fatally shot another man in the head, Michael Harris, 37, who was not related to him. A third shooting victim, Eddie Brown, 50, survived his head wound. And when Mr. Harris ran out of bullets, he fatally stabbed Evelyn Davis, 32, despite her cries to be spared because "I have five babies," according to Mr. Brown and a second witness, Newbry Mitchell, who escaped.
The Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles J. Hynes, said that "we must remember that this trial was a search for the truth and an effort to do justice in the memory" of the victims. Mr. Hynes, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor, has long said that he opposed capital punishment but that he was duty-bound to seek it in appropriate cases while the death penalty law was on the books. He has brought five capital murder cases, the most of any district attorney in the state.
Mr. Hynes's trial prosecutors had told the jury that death was the appropriate penalty. "This was the mechanical, methodical execution of people" during a robbery, making it the "the type of crime for which the death penalty was enacted," declared one of the prosecutors, Jonathan Frank, who tried the case with Heide Mason and Keith Dolan.
But a lawyer for Mr. Harris, Russell Neufeld, called the death sentence "a tragedy for the people of the state of New York and for all the families involved." The victims' families, he said, "feel this will ease the pain of the loss," but the sentence of execution was "not a solution."
Mr. Neufeld said defense lawyers would argue in appealing Mr. Harris's conviction and sentence that New York's capital punishment law was unconstitutional under the Constitutions of both the United States and the state, and that Justice Feldman's denials of various defense motions at the trial had kept Mr. Harris from obtaining a fair trial.
After the sentence was announced, Justice Feldman ordered a suicide watch on Mr. Harris.
In a statement released yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said: "This willful taking of three innocent lives is precisely the kind of heinous crime the state contemplated when it reinstated the death penalty three years ago. I hope today's decision brings some measure of justice to the victims' families and that it deters others from taking human life."
The jurors left the courthouse in a van without talking to reporters. Reached at home, one of them, a science teacher who prepares students for high school equivalency diplomas, said, "Please, please, I don't want to speak with anyone." The jurors, who ranged in age from their 30's to 60's, also included five people in health-related jobs, four in office or blue-collar employment, a retired woman and an unemployed man who last worked as a truck driver. Five have college degrees, including a woman with a Ph.D. in English literature.
Earlier this year, Mr. Harris's case nearly ended in a plea bargain that would have spared his life. But instead, as Mr. Harris began entering his guilty plea on Feb. 23 -- which would have sent him to prison for life without parole -- he stunned the courtroom by suddenly aborting it.
When Justice Feldman asked him twice whether he was "pleading guilty because you are guilty," Mr. Harris said no.
Mr. Neufeld tried to explain shortly afterward that his client had intended to plead guilty but wanted to stop the proceeding because he had not fully understood until then that he was giving up his right to appeal the life-without-parole term.
But at that point, prosecutors refused to accept any guilty plea, arguing that if Mr. Harris sought to withdraw it in the future, his earlier responses to Justice Feldman would allow him to argue -- with a good chance of success -- that his guilty plea had been coerced.
So Mr. Harris's original not-guilty plea stood, and the case went to the jury.
A lawyer for Mr. Harris, Colleen Brady, in her final argument before the jury began deliberating a sentence, had urged the panel to exercise "justice tempered by mercy," holding that Mr. Harris was not "the worst of the worst."
With no previous criminal record, and having saved a life, Mr. Harris had shown "there's some value in him," warranting life in prison, said Ms. Brady, part of a team with Mr. Neufeld and Timothy Rountree from the Legal Aid Society's capital defense unit.
To sentence Mr. Harris to death, the law required the jury to find unanimously "beyond a reasonable doubt" that aggravating factors in the case "substantially" outweighed the mitigating factors proposed by the defense. The two aggravating factors were that Mr. Harris intentionally committed murder while carrying out a robbery and intentionally killed more than one person.
The defense conceded that Mr. Harris was the killer, but disagreed with the prosecution on what had driven him to commit the crimes.
The defense insisted that there had been no robbery and that rather than killing to eliminate witnesses, as the prosecution contended, Mr. Harris had been a severely disturbed man who had "snapped." A psychiatrist testified about severe childhood beatings by Mr. Harris's mother and, in adulthood, about his job losses, drug and alcohol abuse and what he called the traumatic effects of the 1986 jail disturbance in which Mr. Harris saved his colleague.
The defense argued that the violence had left him with the kind of severe psychological and emotional problems diagnosed in many war veterans as post-traumatic stress disorder. The city's Correction Department forced Mr. Harris to resign in 1991 because of his drug use. All this, the defense argued, justified a conviction for first-degree manslaughter, punishable by up to 25 years in prison for each killing. But the jurors disagreed, finding Mr. Harris guilty of first-degree murder and setting up the penalty phase of the trial.
The death sentence came as the tempo of capital trials has picked up in the state. Testimony began Monday in Poughkeepsie in the second such trial, in which Dalkeith V. McIntosh is charged with murdering his estranged wife and her daughter from a previous marriage.
Jury selection is under way in Brooklyn for the third such trial, in which Jermaine Page is accused of the execution-style murder of a man while robbing him. And selection of a jury is to start later this month in the Suffolk County trial of Robert Shulman, who is accused of killing and dismembering three prostitutes.
It was on March 7, 1995, that a newly elected Gov. George E. Pataki fulfilled one of his central campaign vows by signing into law the latest bill that the Legislature had passed to reinstate capital punishment after New York State's highest court, in 1984, declared the remaining provision of the state's previous death penalty law unconstitutional. In doing so, the court voided a death sentence imposed the year before in the last capital trial in a New York State court..
The last person executed in the state, Eddie Lee Mays, was put to death in the electric chair in 1963 for killing a woman while robbing a bar.

HEADLINE: Easing Loans Would Thwart Russian Reforms

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Jeffrey D. Sachs (Op-Ed, June 4) is right that the International Monetary Fund is not looking good in Asia and Russia. Its bailouts favor speculators that charged sky-high interest rates and fail to restore output and employment. However, Mexico's bailout was not very different from Russia's and succeeded in restoring growth. It also saved Latin America from a long spell of no growth and inflation. Moreover, it made money for donors. So what are we missing now? 
 To put it bluntly: not enough money. Partial bailouts may be worse than none. They speed up the exit and do not lay the ground for the early return of flight capital. While $50 billion was enough for Mexico, funds committed for Indonesia are only a fraction of the country's needs.
In addition, since bailouts are accompanied by a nagging foreign presence, political equilibrium is shaken down to its roots, scaring away a wellspring of growth: direct foreign investment.

HEADLINE: Easing Loans Would Thwart Russian Reforms

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Here we go again: Jeffrey D. Sachs attacks the International Monetary Fund (Op-Ed, June 4). He derides the high interest rates that have been required to retain flight capital, charges that the Russian Government is "corrupt and mismanaged," declares that the ruble probably can't be saved, and proves that the I.M.F. is a poor predictor of the results of its policies. 
 If money is fleeing Russia, the exchange rate will depreciate unless the central bank can find foreign money to exchange for the rubles presented. It clearly doesn't have it. Does the I.M.F.? Not enough, which suggests that high interest rates be employed to retain the funds.
Mr. Sachs only implies what he would do. I conclude that he would put himself in charge of the monetary fund, not give Russia any money until its Government is replaced, let the exchange rate fall, and give Russia lots of money so it can pay off the foreigners and keep interest rates low. He doesn't provide any predictions of economic performance, but I wouldn't put much confidence in his either.

HEADLINE: The World;
A Global Divide on Abortion Splits Poor From Rich

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
IT has become an article of faith among those who oppose abortion in the United States that promoting abortion anywhere else, particularly in the world's poorest countries, is tantamount to an attack on the cultures of those countries. It is a new argument from the conservative right, but it echoes charges that the radical left used to make, to the effect that family planning programs targeted at the third world were a kind of neo-imperialistic genocide.
A statistical look around the world shows that if cultural sensitivities are reflected in laws about abortion, there is a remarkable divide between richer countries and poorer ones where abortion and its effects are concerned. But other statistics demonstrate that the pattern of legality does not reflect how women in those societies choose to act.
 
Unequal Death Rates
In the global south, where abortion laws are the most restrictive, abortion rates are still quite high; deaths from abortion are much higher there than elsewhere, because the abortions tend to be unsafe. The industrial countries of the global north are almost universally less restrictive in their abortion laws. They also have the lowest rates of abortion-related deaths. 
 Of about 20 million unsafe -- sometimes legal, but more often illegal -- abortions estimated to take place each year worldwide, 90 percent occur in developing countries, according to the World Health Organization. Of the 80,000 deaths that result, 95 percent are in poor nations. That number does not include women who die of miscarriages due to health problems or poor prenatal care; such data do not exist.
The anti-colonial case has been made forcefully by Representative Christopher H. Smith, the New Jersey Republican who has blocked American payments to the United Nations with an amendment denying money to any organization that lobbies for liberalized abortion laws in any country. Mr. Smith, a supporter of international child survival programs, says helping poor children, not preventing them from being born, should be the priority of foreign aid.
His legislation, which President Clinton has vowed to veto when it reaches his desk, has created alarm among family planning and women's health organizations, who see its bar to advocating abortion as a challenge to free speech and a chilling factor that would reduce the amount of money going to all types of population work, including contraception, in the poorest countries, where they think it is needed most.
Mr. Smith said in a telephone interview that he drew a distinction between contraception and abortion. "We have made it clear we would put more money into family planning," he said. "We offered the Administration $100 million dollars more in family planning aid if they would get out of the abortion business." He added: "Family planning is preventive and its use is up to the individual. But those of us who respect the lives of unborn children recognize that whether it be dismemberment, abortion or chemical poisoning, abortions, legal or illegal, are violence against children everywhere."
Family planning organizations and women's health groups do not argue that abortion should be encouraged as a method of birth control. But they do argue for less restrictive laws in many countries on the ground that such laws would cut deaths. They also say family planning and community health groups in Africa, Asia and Latin America have to deal with the results of botched and life-threatening abortions, sometimes by completing the process of clearing the womb -- a procedure that would put them on the wrong side of American law if Mr. Smith's proposal were adopted.
Mr. Smith argues that he would rather spend money on programs like immunizations, nutritional health for mothers and other forms of health care that would help children in developing societies survive, rather than aiding organizations that are associated with abortion. When asked about the problems posed by unsafe abortion, he said, "We need positive alternatives like the 4,000 crisis pregnancy centers here, where women who have difficulties can be helped in many ways."
Advocates of family planning respond that the overall effect of his proposals could be to harm the ability of mothers to care for their families. "Public health experts will be the first to tell you that child survival is most enhanced by enabling women to space their childbearing," said Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the oldest and largest family planning organization in the world.
Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the United Nations Populations Fund, said the argument that family planners from richer nations are coercing the women of the developing world should be turned upside down. The real coercion in many places, she said, "is that women are being forced to have children by their families or by social pressures."
"Now that women are getting choices, people seem to be starting to object," said Dr. Sadik, a physician from Pakistan. "It's being made out that a woman wants to be pregnant all the time. That's not what all the detailed surveys and research show. Most women don't want to be serially pregnant. They want to have, if not two children, maybe four children, not eight children -- and they don't want to have them every year."
Because family planning services are not available to millions of women who want them -- more than 350 million in the developing world, according to surveys -- they turn to abortion, even where illegal, and will continue to do so as a last resort, experts say. "Contrary to public belief, most of the unsafe illegal abortions take place among married women," Dr. Sadik said.

HEADLINE: Empty Suits In the Board Room;
Under Fire, Mutual Fund Directors Seem Increasingly Hamstrung

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
WHAT'S a mutual fund director to do? Lately, when independent directors have stood up to fund managers, they've gotten their ears boxed. And when, to some eyes, the directors have let fund managers go their own way, they've gotten their ears boxed again.
Consider events of the last two years, a period in which the fund industry has experienced some of its most rapid growth: 
 * When the independent directors of two fund families, the Navellier and Fundamental funds, asserted their legal authority to remove portfolio managers at some of those funds, they swiftly found themselves the targets of nasty proxy battles waged by the fund managers -- and, in the case of the Navellier directors, a shareholder lawsuit.
* When the Securities and Exchange Commission brought charges against the managers of the Parnassus fund and the Rockies fund, contending violations of securities laws, it also charged the funds' independent directors with failing to properly value securities owned by the funds.
* Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago, questioned the independence of directors after finding that among the 82 largest fund families, the more that directors were paid, the more that shareholders shelled out in expenses.
* In a lawsuit brought by a shareholder of the Brazil Fund, a closed-end fund managed by Scudder Kemper Investments, a Federal judge in Manhattan agreed with the plaintiff that outside directors who received compensation for sitting on the board of more than one fund in the same family might not be independent at all.
Rarely, if ever, since the current system of mutual fund oversight was laid out in the Investment Company Act of 1940 have fund directors been under fire on so many fronts at once.
"On the one hand, you've got innumerable parties, including the S.E.C., emphasizing the importance of the independence of directors," said Robert J. Zutz, a partner in the Washington office of the Kirkpatrick & Lockhart law firm and a specialist in mutual fund law. "But on the other hand, where to the greatest degree imaginable, directors have exercised their independence, they get caught up in these unfortunate situations. Ultimately, it could cause a director to pause and take the consequences into account before deciding to act."
To almost any degree that directors hesitate, individual investors stand to lose. Shareholders in most publicly traded corporations can expect various parties -- institutional investors, independent watchdog groups and securities analysts, to name a few -- to help a company's board keep an eye on what insiders are doing. But the fund industry leaves the job almost solely to independent directors -- a disparate bunch. At even the biggest fund families, they can range in background from experienced corporate managers and directors to the friends or college buddies of the top executives of the fund management company.
Their authority, moreover, is unique in American business, because of the peculiar legal fictions that define mutual funds. In theory, a fund is owned by its shareholders, who hire independent directors to run it. The directors select companies to manage the fund, to underwrite the sale of shares and to provide services to shareholders.
In practice, of course, the entire operation is run by one fund company -- Fidelity or Merrill Lynch, Navellier or Fundamental -- which not only provides all those services, but is the brand name that brings shareholders to the fund.
And in recent years, as even some of the most mediocre fund companies have generated spectacular returns, the balance of power has kept shifting further from fund directors and toward the companies that conceive, market and manage mutual funds.
MANY people in and around the fund industry say that is just fine. After all, they note, funds have piled up $5 trillion in assets -- doubling in size in just the last three years -- with barely a whiff of the scandals seen in the banking, savings and loan, brokerage and insurance industries. But around the fringes of the fund business, the strain is starting to show.
"So many mutual fund companies are so new that the industry has just not had enough time and experience to sort out the rules and responsibilities," said John A. Hill, chairman of the First Reserve Corporation, an energy investment firm. He also serves as an independent director of the Putnam funds and has sat on the boards of several publicly traded companies. "Some mutual fund boards are aware of the issues," he said, "but many others are not very aware at all."
The S.E.C., for its part, has acknowledged that some aspects of mutual fund governance need examination. But the commission appears to be edging quite gingerly into the subject.
"The proper role of a fund's board has become a bit controversial lately," allowed Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman, in an address last month to fund industry executives. This fall, he said, the S.E.C. will be the host for a round table intended "to air the issues and to work toward a consensus on whether changes are needed in the current system."
Already, the commission has been flooded with requests from fund companies, corporate governance experts and academics to participate in the round table, S.E.C. officials said. But until that discussion takes place, many directors may be wondering if taking decisive action is more likely to harm than help investors.
Certainly that is the question raised by events surrounding Navellier Aggressive Small Cap Equity, once a $250 million fund, which saw its assets shrink by three-quarters last year as the fund's manager battled with its independent directors.
Louis G. Navellier, a money manager based in Incline Village, Nev., founded the fund in 1993. Three years later, Mr. Navellier proposed merging the fund into a separate fund group that had a different set of independent directors -- steps that he said would reduce operating expenses through economies of scale.
But the directors of Aggressive Small Cap Equity opposed the move, and the difference of opinion quickly grew ugly.
The board, which said Mr. Navellier refused to provide information about his management company, dismissed him in March 1997 and hired Massachusetts Financial Services, proprietor of the MFS family of mutual funds, to manage the fund.
Mr. Navellier, who said he provided the board with all the information to which it was entitled, fought back. Under the Investment Company Act, the directors were required within 120 days to get shareholder approval for the manager change. With a campaign of mailings and phone calls, Mr. Navellier rallied enough investor support to block the move. The directors rehired him -- and subsequently resigned.
It is difficult, though, to declare anyone a winner. During the battle, most shareholders simply moved their money out of the fund, whose assets have dwindled to $60 million. And now, Mr. Navellier has joined with several of his loyal shareholders in a class-action suit against the former independent directors, their lawyer and MFS, seeking to recover up to $14 million in capital gains taxes that shareholders incurred last year.
The defendants and others in the fund industry have asked why the S.E.C. did not support what the independent directors believed was an attempt to protect shareholders.
"In this case, the Navellier directors did precisely what they were supposed to do: They raised the issues and went to shareholders to vote on them," said C. Meyrick Payne, a senior partner at Management Practice, a New York consulting firm that works with independent directors. "But there was a moment when you wondered whether the S.E.C. should have been a little more supportive."
Barry Barbash, director of the commission's division of investment management, which regulates mutual funds, declined to comment on the Navellier case. But in general, he said, the agency seeks to avoid taking any action that could influence how shareholders vote in a proxy contest.
"The S.E.C. tries to play referee and make sure everybody plays fair," Mr. Barbash said. "We'll throw a flag if someone is clearly violating the rules. But a proxy contest is not a situation where the S.E.C. should come in and say something that will change the outcome of the game."
If Navellier were an isolated case, it might be dismissed as an anomaly in a rapidly growing, diverse industry. But another confrontation is occurring at the Fundamental funds, a New York-based family of six funds with total assets of about $170 million. And in this case, shareholders may be faced with an even less appealing set of choices.
Fundamental's history has not been full of investing success; its volatile funds tend to careen between the top and bottom performance quartiles. Fundamental's New York Muni, its largest fund, is the only municipal bond fund of any type to lose money in the last five years.
Believing that investors in the funds had suffered enough, their directors voted last year to seek a replacement for the company that has long managed the funds.
Initially, Vincent J. Malanga, president of Fundamental Portfolio Advisors, the fund manager, supported the move; in fact, he found a potential replacement, Tocqueville Asset Management, which oversees a family of funds operating under the Tocqueville name. The board concurred, and, as an interim measure, a manager from Tocqueville began managing the Fundamental funds last year.
According to the fund's filings with the S.E.C., the board soon discovered that the manager had been routing portfolio trades through a Tocqueville-related brokerage firm, a potential violation of securities regulations. Tocqueville dismissed him, but the four independent Fundamental directors split on whether to go ahead with the plan to hire Tocqueville permanently. The two directors who opposed the hiring resigned.
In the meantime, Mr. Malanga and his firm were charged by the S.E.C. with failing to disclose the risks involved in special securities owned by one of the Fundamental funds in 1993-94; the firm, without admitting or denying the allegations, recently settled a false-advertising complaint by the National Association of Securities Dealers over the same issue.
Now Mr. Malanga has turned against Tocqueville; he wants shareholders to replace all the board members with a new group that, presumably, would again name him the funds' manager. The directors responded by throwing out Mr. Malanga and his firm last Monday and hiring Toqueville to take over the funds -- a move that requires shareholder confirmation within 120 days.
Given the situation, even the most educated shareholders might have trouble deciding what is in their best interest. As with the Navellier funds, many have decided to flee rather than to choose sides; assets have dropped by nearly one-third over the last year. And while a consequence of that decision for investors is to lock in losses, some in the industry say it is the best way to discipline fund managers.
"We realize that if a fund company is not looking out for shareholders, we get to vote with our feet," said Gregory D. Sullivan, a principal at Sullivan Bruyette Speros & Blayney, a McLean, Va., investment adviser. "There are a lot of alternative funds for us to consider."
The system, of course, is set up to provide checks and balances other than pitched battles and mass redemptions of shares. But if shareholders can get hurt when a fund's directors and its managers are at loggerheads, they can also suffer if everyone gets too cozy.
That is the assertion in a lawsuit that threw the fund industry into a tizzy last year. The lawsuit, brought by a shareholder of the Brazil Fund, contends that directors of the fund were likely to put the interests of Scudder, its manager, ahead of those of shareholders, because the directors received tens of thousands of dollars for overseeing scores of other Scudder funds as well.
Judge Robert W. Sweet of Federal District Court in Manhattan, in refusing to dismiss the complaint, said that "the close and financially rewarding relationship with Scudder is sufficient to call into question the independence and disinterest of these directors." The case is pending.
The industry mainstream was shocked by the judge's ruling. "I think he was off his rocker," said Thomas R. Smith Jr., a partner at the New York law firm of Brown & Wood and co-chairman of an American Bar Association task force that wrote a legal guidebook for fund directors. "The whole structure of the '40 Act provides that serving on more than one board will not make you" an insider, he said.
The S.E.C. took no formal position in the case. "Our view is that the amount of money a director is making does not make him independent or not independent," said Mr. Barbash. "But shareholders should be told how much the directors are being paid." That information is included in a fund's S.E.C. filings.
Fund companies have less direct control over fund directors than one might assume. Independent directors themselves usually select nominees to fill vacancies, and nominees must be voted on by shareholders. Independent directors also set their own salaries and hire their own outside lawyers. And while the law requires only that 40 percent of a fund's board be independent, in practice they constitute a majority on nearly all fund boards.
Fund directors also say they regularly stand up to a fund's managers. "I'd say that every year we have some issue, particularly involving the contracts to manage the funds, where we have some disagreement with the manager," said Mr. Hill, the Putnam director.
That does not mean that directors are always pushing for lower fees. "We have to make sure that the fees the funds are paying are competitive enough to keep the players in the game," said Stephen K. West, a lawyer at the New York firm of Sullivan & Cromwell who serves as an independent director of the Pioneer and Winthrop Focus funds. "The competition for managerial talent is enormous, which has caused the cost of running the business to explode."
As the fund industry has boomed in size, fund companies have seen their profitability soar. In part, the growth comes from having more assets to manage. But an oft-cited Morningstar study found that newer funds charge higher management fees than older funds. And in another study, Morningstar found that directors were paid more by fund families with higher expenses, raising "serious questions about the role independent trustees play in protecting shareholders."
Signals from the S.E.C. have been mixed on this front. Regulators have warned that they will be quick to question the directors of fund companies that consistently get higher-than-average management fees but produce below-par performance. Yet Mr. Levitt told fund executives last month that "directors don't have to guarantee that a fund pays the lowest rates, but they do have to make sure that fees fall within a reasonable band."
The agency has been more consistent in challenging directors whom it judges have failed to oversee fund managers' conduct. The S.E.C. recently has brought enforcement cases against the Parnassus fund, a mutual fund, and the Rockies fund, a closed-end fund, charging independent directors with failing to adequately police how the fund's managers valued certain stocks. The charges are being fought by the directors and the fund companies involved.
WHILE a different form of corporate governance might be able to better assure the independence and competence of directors, shareholders don't seem to be banging down the doors for change. Still, some new ideas might come up at the S.E.C. round table this fall.
In much of the rest of the world, and in unit trusts in the United States, fund directors are not responsible for setting a fund's management fee. Free from questions about the economics of a fund's management contracts, directors could spend their time monitoring a manager's business practices -- how brokerage commissions are allocated, whether investment guidelines are being followed and the like.
And shareholders are now being given more leeway to directly influence the governance of their funds. Last month, the S.E.C. ruled that directors of closed-end funds must adhere to results of votes on shareholder proposals to replace the manager of a fund. (A closed-end fund operates much like a mutual fund, except that its finite number of shares are traded on a stock exchange.)
The industry may also take a fresh look at some existing, alternative governance plans. The boards of the American Express IDS funds, for example, employ full-time officers separate from the officers of the management company. That structure emerged after a struggle for control of the funds' managers in the late 1950's.
"When the board is confronted with issues that raise questions about whether a fund's assets are being properly used and managed, that structure adds an additional safeguard," said Leslie Ogg, president of the Board Services Corporation, the independent company that oversees the operations of the American Express IDS funds.
Even that structure does not guarantee that directors will stand up to management on all issues. For that, Mr. Ogg said, responsibility ultimately lies with Washington.
"It does take a strong S.E.C. to make independent directors effective," Mr. Ogg said. "In the end, as a director you've got very little economic leverage. You've only got your prestige. That's the point where a director has got to be able to say that he has the support of regulators in acting independently."

 CORRECTION:
An article on June 7 about challenges to the power of mutual fund directors attributed a quotation erroneously. Thomas R. Smith Jr., a partner at the New York law firm of Brown & Wood, said in an interview that he disagreed with a ruling in which Judge Robert W. Sweet of Federal District Court in Manhattan refused to dismiss a complaint that a fund's directors were likely to put the interests of management ahead of those of shareholders. But it was not Mr. Smith who said the judge was "off his rocker" in making the ruling. That phrase was used by another lawyer, not quoted in the article.

On average, corporate directors earn more for their service than do the directors of mutual funds. But directors of the biggest fund companies are paid more than directors of the biggest corporations. And while a large portion of the typical corporate director's pay comes in the form of incentives that increase in value if the company performs well, mutual fund directors receive virtually no incentive pay.

THE GREAT HILL STATIONS OF ASIA
By Barbara Crossette.
Illustrated. 259 pp. Boulder, Colo.:
Westview Press. $28. 
 The first Europeans to reach India were bewitched by its beauty and strangeness but shocked by its climate. In 1690 an English clergyman, James Ovington, noted that few survived more than a couple of miasmal rainy seasons -- "Two moussouns are the Age of Man." A century later officials recorded the life expectancy for a European male as 31, a female 28. Then, without knowing why -- 6,000 feet is the ceiling of the malaria-bearing anopheles mosquito -- people realized health lay high in the hills, so when the soaking, febrile heat of summer began stealing across the plains, the viceroy himself led the exodus. For several months, ruling India from above the clouds, they enjoyed the luxury of sleeping under blankets, attended "ball after ball, each followed by a little backbiting," and built towns complete with tearooms, clubs, honeysuckle-framed cottages and pretty steepled churches. Though hill stations were a British-Indian innovation (96 of them went up), they soon began appearing in Indonesia, Burma, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, the Philippines, even Vietnam.
 Barbara Crossette, the United Nations bureau chief for The New York Times, has reported extensively from the area and in 1996, while traveling through the uplands of Indonesian Sumatra, hit on the idea of making a high-altitude circuit through eight countries. Though she calls the result "only a travel book," "The Great Hill Stations of Asia" should be required reading for anyone contemplating an Asian journey; the region's history, politics, religion and economics are brilliantly summarized in a series of crisp, scholarly briefings. Yet she also maintains a lively social curiosity: she finds the Vietnamese "warm, inquisitive, generous people who want to draw an outsider into whatever activity is at hand," while Burma, despite its evil administration, remains a country "blessed by nature, where there are always things to eat or sell and the means to live in dignity."
 Of the 18 hill stations she visited, two had American connections. Kodaikanal was founded as a summer retreat in 1845 by American missionaries 7,000 feet up in southern India's Palni Hills. Though the first church -- roofed with Huntley and Palmer biscuit tins -- was flattened by a mountain storm, the schoolhouse grew into the famous Kodaikanal International School, still unequivocally American in its style and curriculum. (The first principal, Margaret Norton Eddy, herself went to school in Kansas with Buffalo Bill Cody.) Today, in season, up to 10,000 Indian tourists are bussed daily into Kodaikanal -- a reminder that Asia's hill stations, far from being derided as crumbling colonial relics, are enjoying a reincarnatory boom as Asia's prosperous post-colonial middle classes themselves swarm upward to enjoy cool air and mountain scenery.
 Until the United States ceded it to the Philippines in 1991, the Club John Hay at Baguio, its cultural roots in the Poconos or upstate New York, was the only American hill station in Asia established for expatriates. Even as Crossette explored this quiet and beautiful spot, walked the gardens and visited "the silly little Cemetery of Negativism, where earnest Americans 'buried' bad things like sloth and mendacity," she knew the new tenants had plans for a luxury hotel, shopping mall and championship golf course.
 Many young Asians, furiously building for the future, display a curious lack of interest in the past; for them Year 1 of the new ephemeris started on the day they kicked out their foreign oppressors. This makes historical research chancy. She found bookshops and libraries in the hill stations largely bereft of material -- though in Sri Lanka's Nuwara Eliya, set among tea plantations, she got lucky and tracked down a reluctant 95-year-old historian. (During a recent visit I could find only a 1929 newspaper carrying a leopard alert: "At least six of the brutes are on the prowl.")
 Crossette has a weakness for hotels and writes about them at length, here complaining about the service, there the state in which previous guests have left them. "South Asians seem to me to be inexplicably hard on public buildings," she writes. "They scar walls, stain carpets and slash upholstery with remarkable casualness." In the Sumatra highlands she stayed at the delightful Pusako at Bukittinggi, but seems to have missed the floor show in which impassive, barefooted female dancers jump vigorously up and down on piles of plates, reducing them to splinters. (She also neglects to mention the local duck races; mallards with the musculature of auks fly 110-yard sprints and win their owners one-tenth of an ounce of gold.)
Air-conditioning and antibiotics have changed the nature of life in the torrid zone. Tropical fatigue is now a recognized medical condition; you can get pills for it. The hill stations should be redundant, yet, as this surprising, entertaining and elegantly written book demonstrates, many continue to flourish. And though Crossette often dwells necessarily in the past, her reportorial instincts remain on full alert. In Mandalay, for example, she found everyone talking about a new hospital for eye, ear, nose and throat specialists that had recently collapsed, crushing an unknown number of staff members and patients: " 'You won't read about that in the newspaper,' someone said. 'But we all know what is going on.' Money laundering and corruption is what he meant."

HEADLINE: FROM THE DESK OF;
In China, Tomorrow Belongs To Greed

BYLINE: By AMY WU; Amy Wu, a native New Yorker, is currently working as a journalist in Hong Kong.

 BODY:
THE house my great-grandparents owned sits in a narrow concrete alley in Shanghai. The walls are decaying like a rotten tooth, and the door opens into a rusty kitchen. The clock in the sitting room is a relic from before Mao came to power, the light fixture dangles as a memory from earlier days. My grandparents were married in this house, now filled with dog-eared books and broken dishes. Some call it junk; I call it history.
Nonetheless, it is a history that is quickly disappearing in the new China. 
 On a recent trip to Shanghai, from my current home in Hong Kong, I made the rounds to relatives' and friends' new homes. I found them spacious and modern, with imported goods far outnumbering domestic. The interiors included English-style furniture, Greek-style columns and French-style chandeliers. The homes are filled with the newest Western gadgets, too -- microwave ovens, 48-inch televisions, a telephone in each room and remote-control heating. And their balconies overlook a city that is quickly coming to resemble Tokyo or New York.
This is the face of overnight modernization, toward an extreme without an in-between, especially among an under-30 generation keen on being rich and flaunting it.
On a trip to Beijing, my two 20-something cousins bragged about eating out every night and proudly waved a dinner receipt for $35 -- no small sum in China. They made a big show of checking for voice messages and chatting on their expensive cellular phones. Ditto for a friend in Shanghai who buys only imported and expensive European foods, not because she loves them, but because it shows status.
One cousin in Shanghai was full of questions about the latest Western fashions and trends, including the coolest cars. He had spent much of his early 20's dancing at expensive discos. Although, like many young Chinese, he has a low-paying, menial job, he spends every cent.
In fact, when I asked young people about their goals and their thoughts about saving for the future, I received quite a few blank looks. There were no dreams of joining the democracy movement or of even attaining an M.B.A. One young man was the most frank: "My goal for the future is to be rich."
It is not simply getting rich, though, but getting rich fast that's the new religion.
One middle-aged woman I met has two daughters who have made millions of dollars and have expensive apartments in Hong Kong and Shanghai. They have had several wealthy boyfriends, and one of them recently married a wealthy man from Beijing at least a dozen years her senior. They make their living as high-class prostitutes.
I know several young people who are involved in other illegitimate businesses. One has opened a store that sells under-the-counter, pirated compact disks and videos. Another is networking to acquire financing for an electronic gambling business. Of course, the money they amass goes toward buying the high life.
I'm 22 and have been working in Hong Kong for more than a year. Members of my generation here are often accused of being wasteful, greedy and hedonistic, but at least young adults in Hong Kong show some dedication to self-improvement, the entrepreneurial spirit and the value of hard work.
Among my generation elsewhere in China, waste, greed and pleasure-seeking seem to have won out over capitalism's more appealing virtues; meanwhile, much of the country is mired in poverty.
A family friend brought me to see her dying godmother in a Government hospital in Shanghai. It was dingy and filthy, and the February chill rattled the windows. It was a place where the old die alone -- something that would have been unthinkable in the China of my great-grandparents.
Politicians and Westerners talk about China's growth in terms of G.D.P., construction spending and average salary. No one talks about growth that sometimes is so fast that it strips away respect for tradition and an appreciation of history.
MY great-aunt still lives in the home she inherited from my great-grandparents. She is in her 80's and refuses to leave the house, which will surely be torn down someday to make way for another shoddy skyscraper. But young Chinese cannot seem to see beyond the facade of wealth.
The trick is to strike a balance of past and present, to heed the warnings from across Asia about the risks of change at a breakneck pace. Otherwise, when the new wipes out the old, what really will be left?

HEADLINE: Sitting Out The Boom;
'We've Saved All Our Lives'

BYLINE: By Amy Silverman; Amy Silverman is a staff writer at The Phoenix New Times.

 BODY:
Betty and Paul Bellanger are riding out the go-go 90's in Sunnyslope -- a run-down neighborhood in north Phoenix -- inside a small, neat house with a chain-link fence and an ancient, mint-green pickup truck out front. The Bellangers have feisty opinions about many things, they watch a lot of television (mostly public) and they read. That's how they know about the money boom, which otherwise is not a daily reality in their house. Betty, 66, is a homemaker; Paul is a retired electrician. He's 67. Their monthly income is $2,400, including Paul's Army and union pensions and both their Social Security checks. With this the Bellangers pay the bills, feed a savings account and still manage to send $300 a month to their grandson David, who's studying computers at the University of Arizona in Tucson.
The Bellangers' old-fashioned attitudes about money -- you save it by not spending it -- were shaped during the Depression and World War II, when hard times made every dollar worthy of a tight grip. During a recent evening of talk, they made it clear that the boom, to them, is a slightly menacing illusion. They also kidded around and, more than once, finished each other's sentences. Apparently, 47 years together have put them in sync, particularly on matters of the wallet. 
 Betty: Yeah, it was on "Frontline." They were saying how because the economy's booming and everything's so wonderful, people aren't saving money. I don't think most people save money.
Paul: They get it and they spend it.
Betty: They think that their plastic card is not money and they are perfectly willing to mortgage their entire future and pay 21 percent interest. The clothes they bought are long gone and they're still paying for them. That's so dumb! We have a fixed income but----.
Paul: But we've saved all our lives. Even if it was only a dollar a week, since we first got married, we saved.
Betty: I'm just astonished at how children spend money. Our daughter's 41 and she'll say, oh, it doesn't matter, it's only a dollar. It's only a couple of dollars. A dollar or a couple of dollars? That's a lot of money!
Paul: And then at the end of the month she's crying because she's broke.
There's a lot the Bellangers don't understand about these flush times. Like: why do people put so much faith in the stock market when common sense dictates that a crash surely must come?
Paul: That market has just gone too far----.
Betty: It's like a balloon! It goes so high, and then it breaks under pressure.
Paul: That's the only thing that worries me, that our pensions are stuck in some sort of----.
Betty: There's kids right here within walking distance of my house that are hungry, and yet we give millions to all these foreign countries. That'd be like you and your husband getting your paychecks and giving 75 percent of it to the neighbors across the street. Well, that's really nice of you, but if we ran our home the way the Government runs theirs----.
Paul: We'd be out in the streets.
Wary of the future, the Bellangers have socked away enough cash to last maybe five years.
Betty: There is no such thing now as a stable job. Used to be that you went to work for a company and you worked there until you retired. This friend of ours did that real fine microscope work at Honeywell and she got laid off. Now they're going to move the whole shebang to Mexico. Whatever happened to loyalty, where if a company hired you, they kept you? As long as you did your job, of course.
Paul: Well, they've gotta please the people investing in the economy. They don't make "x" many hundred millions of dollars a year, they're losing money.
Betty laughs. The Bellangers extract a lot of amusement from the boom. For instance, they think it's very funny that people believe they deserve all the money they're raking in.
Paul: They worship it. That's their whole goal in life, to just pile up a mass of money so they can sit there and look at it, I guess.
Betty: What can they do with it all? You can sleep in one bed, you can ride in one car. Why do you need to have 14 houses and a wardrobe closet as big as my living room?
Of course, this is a woman who refuses to pay the outrageous price demanded for an ice-cream cone at Baskin-Robbins. Betty saves a mishmash of vegetables for soup and she absolutely hates shopping -- but she's hardly a miser. Last year the Bellangers scraped up $550 in donations and went on a shopping spree at Toys "R" Us, buying two toys each for 65 kids at the Sunnyslope Community Center in their neighborhood.
Betty: We had the best time! Several of them came up to me and said: "Betty, is it O.K. if we don't open our presents until Christmas? Because we don't have presents at home." That's horrible! I read in the paper about four years ago -- and if I ever see this woman I'll kill her with my bare hands -- some movie or TV star, they said she spent $25,000 on a white-and-silver Christmas tree. That's obscene. Do you know what I could do with $25,000 for those kids?
