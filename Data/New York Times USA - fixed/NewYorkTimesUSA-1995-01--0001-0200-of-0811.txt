BOREDOM: The Literary History of a State of Mind, by Patricia Meyer Spacks. (University of Chicago, $24.95.) A persuasive account of a concept invented in the 18th century; its roots include a growing concentration on "inner experience" as the locus of personal reality.
 
THE FIRST WORLD WAR: A Complete History, by Martin Gilbert. (Holt, $35.) Mr. Gilbert's enormous breadth of view seeks to render this dreadful conflict as soldiers lived it on many fronts, often relying on the poetry and prose of the many gifted writers who saw action.
 
GENTLEMAN SPY: The Life of Allen Dulles, by Peter Grose. (Richard Todd/Houghton Mifflin, $30.) A biography, full of new information, of the irresistibly charming (and manipulative) man who headed -- and embodied -- the Central Intelligence Agency from 1953 to 1961.

KONFIDENZ, by Ariel Dorfman. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $17.) This novel in dialogue reveals only gradually that its frightening political developments are taking place in 1939, suggesting that fear is always appropriate.
 
LONG WALK TO FREEDOM: The Autobiography of Nelson Mandela, by Nelson Mandela. (Little, Brown, $24.95.)

THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE: Tales and Conjurations
By Charles Johnson. Plume, $9.95.
Magic is the theme connecting these eight short stories, which sometimes deal with contemporary sleight of hand and sometimes hark back to the ancient tribal powers of African wizards. "Mr. Johnson's spell of a book comes on with the authority of a classic," Michael Ventura said here in 1986.
A DIFFERENT PERSON: A Memoir
By James Merrill. HarperSanFrancisco, $14.
This acclaimed American poet looks back on his youth, writing of the trip he made to Rome in 1950 at the age of 24. There, he came to embrace more fully both his poetic voice and his homosexuality. "What sets this memoir apart is the writing and the humor," Brigitte Weeks said here in 1993. "Every page contains a sentence one wants to quote to a friend." Also reissued is Mr. Merrill's (DIBLOS) NOTEBOOK (Dalkey Archive, $9.95), which takes the form of notes for a novel about the narrator's brother and his experiences in Greece. In 1965 our reviewer, Wilfrid Sheed, called it "a disciplined, adventurous performance in the best tradition of fictional experiment." 

ON THE REAL SIDE:
Laughing, Lying, and Signifying -- The Underground Tradition of African-American Humor That Transformed American Culture, From Slavery to Richard Pryor
By Mel Watkins. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $15.
The author analyzes the comic spirit of black Americans, showing how humor was often forged from oppression and how the self-deprecating, wry tone of many jokes and routines masked strong defiance and incisive social commentary. "Mel Watkins's book is the most comprehensive and penetrating history yet written," Lawrence W. Levine said here last year.
GRINGA
By Sandra Scofield. Plume, $10.95.
The setting for this novel is Mexico City in 1968, where a young woman, Abilene Painter, has gone to seek an abortion but finds herself caught up in the local student protests. Her new political awareness helps her shed her passivity. In 1989 our reviewer, Michele Wolf, said, "Abilene's coming of age is masterfully conveyed through fully realized, complex characters."
36 VIEWS OF MOUNT FUJI: On Finding Myself in Japan
By Cathy N. Davidson. Plume, $10.95.
The author, who taught in Japan in the 1980's, immersed herself in the country's culture, which she found welcoming rather than distant. "This appealing book is always sincere," Francine Prose said here in 1993. Also reissued is THE WORLD OF THE SHINING PRINCE: Court Life in Ancient Japan, by Ivan Morris (Kodansha Globe, $15), which opens a window on the cloistered, insular universe of the aristocracy of the vanished city of Heian-kyo. In 1964 our reviewer, Oliver Statler, said the author "has made the 10th century come alive."
SAVAGE NIGHTS
By Cyril Collard. Translated by William Rodarmor. Tusk/Overlook, $11.95.
The inspiration for the recent autobiographical movie of the same title, this novel traces the love affairs of Jean, a bisexual film maker who loves a young actress but cannot give up his "savage nights" of brutal and depersonalized encounters with men. Collard, who died of AIDS in 1993, "has indisputably created something of value," Elizabeth Gaffney said here last year.
NEVER STOP RUNNING: Allard Lowenstein and the Struggle to Save American Liberalism
By William H. Chafe. Basic Books, $15.
Exploring both Lowenstein's political career and personal style, this portrait reveals a man who frequently embraced radical tactics but was deeply committed to changing American government from within. In 1993 our reviewer, David Oshinsky, called it "both a superb biography . . . and a gripping history."
SECRETS
By Kelvin Christopher James.
Vintage Contemporaries, $10.
Uxann, a girl growing up in Trinidad, faces not only the trials of adolescence but also betrayal by her father, the man she trusts most. This novel "ambitiously examines jealousy, loyalty, the mysteries of sex and the horrors of incest," Michael E. Ross said here last year.
THE ENDANGERED AMERICAN DREAM:
How to Stop the United States From Becoming a Third-World Country and How to Win the Geo-Economic Struggle for Industrial Supremacy
By Edward N. Luttwak.
Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14.
The author sees war brewing everywhere, not on the battlefield but in economics. He believes America will decline if it does not support high technology and upgrade education. In 1993 our reviewer, Jeffrey E. Garten, said he "brings a keen historical perspective and a fertile mind to a host of important questions."
CARRIAGE TRADE
By Stephen Birmingham. Bantam, $5.99.
This plot-packed novel paints the behind-the-scenes world of Tarkington's, a glitzy Fifth Avenue department store; its characters manipulate human lives as easily as they do balance sheets. The result is "as pleasurable as a fast cruise through the Chanel department at Bergdorf's," Wendy Wasserstein said here in 1993. As for the goods on a real retail emporium, there's LIKE NO OTHER STORE . . .: The Bloomingdale's Legend and the Revolution in American Marketing, by Marvin Traub and Tom Teicholz (Times Books/Random House, $15). Mr. Traub, former chairman of the business that made shopping theater, tells of the store's winning strategies while hurling barbs at his successors. In 1993 our reviewer, Stephanie Strom, said the book is "far more than a personal memoir," chronicling "changing postwar appetites." LAUREL GRAEBER

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Smoke-Free Flights Increase

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
SMOKE-FREE flying suddenly looks a lot more real. Beginning today, Delta Air Lines will be the first United States airline to ban smoking on all flights. On the heels of Delta's announcement in November, six other United States airlines and two foreign lines moved toward banning smoking on trans-Atlantic flights, petitioning the Department of Transportation to be exempted from antitrust prosecution if they jointly agreed to do this.
And, on March 1, an agreement by the United States, Australia and Canada will take effect, banning smoking on all scheduled nonstop flights between the countries. 
 The three-government agreement, unlike the 1990 United States regulation banning passenger smoking on domestic flights, forbids smoking by crew members in the cockpit. Because of this, and because the agreement affects long flights over the Pacific, an enforcement expert at the Department of Transportation said the pact represented a key step toward the United Nations goal of eliminating airline smoking by July 1, 1996. Because of the length of the Pacific flights, and the high percentage of smokers in Asia, airlines have been edgy about those routes.
New Zealand, which participated in the talks leading to the agreement, signed in Chicago on Nov. 1, found it needed to amend its civil aviation act before it could sign. Rob Moore-Jones, a counselor for trade and economic issues in the New Zealand Embassy, expects the legislature to approve the amendment this year and a signing soon thereafter.
In eliminating smoking on its flights worldwide, Delta acted on the basis of passenger surveys and under pressure from its cabin crews. The ban extends to its 45 Crown Club facilities in 38 airports.
 
 
Steps Toward U.N. Goal
 On Dec. 15, American, Continental, Northwest, Trans World Airlines, United and USAir, joined by British Airways and K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines, asked the Department of Transportation for immunity from antitrust action if they agreed to eliminate smoking over the Atlantic.
The airlines did not mention Delta, but pointed to the United Nations deadline and to Transportation Secretary Federico Pena's commitment to smoke-free travel.
"The joint applicants believe," the request said, "that voluntary action will permit . . . smoke-free travel in a faster and more orderly fashion than the present process of government regulation and negotiation."
Ed O'Hara, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation, said that outside comments on the request were accepted until Friday, and that a prompt response could be expected from the department.
In late October, United Airlines added smoke-free flights between San Francisco and Sydney -- which would have been mandatory on March 1 anyway -- and San Francisco and Hong Kong. It also banned smoking on two more New York-London flights. United bans smoking on its flights to and from Canada and Caribbean and Mexican resorts.
American has banned smoking on three trans-Atlantic round trips linking New York and Chicago with London, and will do the same for seasonal services linking Dallas-Fort Worth with London and Chicago with Manchester.
Northwest, which had not had an overseas nonsmoking flight, on Nov. 1 started one between Seattle and Hong Kong. On Oct. 30, British Airways added one of its four New York-London round trips to its nonsmoking list. This week, it will begin new services between New York and Birmingham, England, and between New York and Glasgow, and these will be nonsmoking. The line has also banned smoking on one of two Hong Kong-London daily round trips, one of two Los Angeles-London daily round trips and one of two San Francisco-London round trips.
Domestic airlines have usually said that banning smoking on routes between Tokyo and the United States would put them at sharp competitive disadvantage. But Delta said that its survey showed that the number of people rejecting a smoke-free flight would be more than offset by those selecting it. And Cathay Pacific, flying to Hong Kong out of Toronto, Vancouver and Los Angeles, has been smoke-free over the Pacific since 1992, although it has smoking flights linking Taiwan, Korea and Japan.
 
 
Survey Behind Delta Policy
 Delta said it surveyed 4,200 trans-Pacific passengers in August and September, distributing the questionnaire in English, Chinese, Japanese and Korean. The line said that those favoring smoke-free flights outnumbered the others, 4 to 1. Before the survey, the line had announced a Jan. 1 smoking ban for its trans-Atlantic, intra-Europe and New York-Mexico flights. In November, the ban went systemwide.
But any Delta flights operated by other airlines with which the line has a code-sharing agreement are not governed by Delta's policy. Under code-sharing, the line may sell a Delta ticket and the reservations computer may show the flight as a Delta flight, but the service may be provided by another line. Delta has code-sharing agreements with Aeroflot, Aeromexico, Austrian Airlines, Malev Hungarian Airlines, Sabena, Swissair, TAP Air Portugal and Varig. In cases of acute smoke allergy, passengers should insist on learning if the flight is operated by Delta. The United States regulation guaranteeing a nonsmoking seat to a passenger requesting one does not apply to foreign airlines.
The three-nation nonsmoking agreement was signed in Chicago to mark the 50th anniversary of the Chicago Convention, a network of agreements on international civil aviation. In 1944, before World War II ended, President Roosevelt convened a meeting looking toward peacetime air travel. The International Civil Aviation Organization grew out of the Chicago Convention, making it older than the United Nations, with which it is now affiliated.
For Canada, the pact merely put an international imprint on an existing policy: In July Canada banned smoking aboard airlines based in Canada. In addition to New Zealand, Singapore is also considering joining the pact, according to Dr. Agnes J. Huff, director of public affairs for Singapore Airlines, a publicly held company in which the Government invests. Singapore Airlines has banned smoking on 88 percent of its flights, the exception being those beginning or ending in Japan.
On the legislative front, in October the House of Representatives approved a bill that would have banned smoking on all international flights to or from the United States, but the bill died in the Senate. A staff member of the House Aviation Subcommittee said that Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota, the bill's sponsor, would try again in the next Congress. But the political climate does not look favorable and questions have been raised about the ability of the United States to enforce such a law.
 
 
From Air to Sea
 Princess Cruises announced that it would have smoke-free dining rooms on all nine of its ships starting today; it joined at least four other lines in complete dining-room bans, according to a spokeswoman for the Cruise Lines International Association: Carnival, Epirotiki, Majesty and World Explorer.

HEADLINE: ARTS ARTIFACTS;
A Multicultural Medley of Styles, 1920 to 1945

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
CRAFTS IN AMERICA flourished increasingly at the grass-roots level between 1920 and 1945, with artisans spurred on midway by Federal money in the New Deal era. The work they produced was distinctively varied: Colonial-style chairs, Mondrian-like quilts, Hispanic images of saints, cornhusk dolls dressed as flappers and Pueblo pots bearing political statements.
Now such objects can be seen in "Revivals! Diverse Traditions: 1920-1945," an ambitious, if disjointed, exhibition at the American Craft Museum in Manhattan through Feb. 26. Five curators chose the objects and wrote much of the catalogue, published by the museum and Harry N. Abrams ($49.50, cloth; $29.95, paper). The show, the second of eight in the museum's series on the history of 20th-century American crafts, was financed mainly by a grant from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund. 
 The 170 items on view reflect the many craft cultures at work then -- African-American, Appalachian, American Indian, Hispanic and Anglo-Saxon. Conventional items dominate, but there are remarkable pieces, too.
Among them are a glorious geometric-patterned basket woven in the 1930's by Carrie Bethel, a Paiute Indian of California; an elegantly scrolled wrought-iron window grill, circa 1940, by Philip Simmons, a blacksmith of African descent in Charleston, S.C., and a faithful 1920's reproduction of a 17th-century armchair, made under the direction of Wallace Nutting, a Framingham, Mass., expert in Colonial furniture.
While stimulating, this multicultural mix of materials and styles is also confusing, since the items in one category rarely seem esthetically related to those in another.
"The exhibition celebrates diversity," said Janet Kardon, director of the museum and the project. "There are lots of parallels, especially technical ones, in the basketry and the quilts. The exhibition brings material together that the scholars have not yet analyzed."
But perhaps the show's most provocative aspect, mentioned often but never fully developed in the wall texts or the catalogue, is the Government's role in advancing crafts in all ethnic categories in the 1930's. By then the Arts and Crafts movement had lost its luster, and its dynamic pioneers were long gone. But the 19th-century message of the movement's British founder, William Morris -- that good design in handmade household articles improved society -- continued to make crafts desirable.
Federal support under President Franklin D. Roosevelt helped renew the movement, reviving handblown Colonial-style glass at the Works Progress Administration's factory in Vineland, N.J., and subsidizing the production of chairs, tables, hooked rugs and woven draperies at Timberline Lodge, a ski resort at Mt. Hood in Oregon that was and still is partly owned by the National Forest Service. The Civilian Conservation Corps, the National Department of Indian Affairs and the Farm Security Administration offered other programs, training artisans in ceramics, metalworking, quilting and basketry while easing unemployment.
The results, as seen in this show, were often impressive. Mary Histia, an Acoma Indian potter from New Mexico, celebrated Government involvement in crafts by emblazoning a large earthenware jar, circa 1930, with the American eagle and the words "Our President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, U.S., We Do Our Part." In the 1940's, an unknown artisan in a W.P.A. factory updated an 18th-century pitcher by audaciously lengthening the curved handle and changing its faintly tinted coloring to a brilliant blue.
The show focuses on reproductions and reinterpretations of centuries-old craft styles, and the most traditional are the Hispanic crafts. The intricately stitched lacework by Puerto Rican women especially stands out: tablecloths and bedcovers with the same geometric motifs, delicate flowers and birds seen in the work of the artisans' ancestors.
Not everything on view in "Revivals!" appears traditional. The vivid abstract patterning on a 1940's coverlet by Susan Pless, a black quilter from Oklahoma, relates as strongly to the art of Mondrian as to the lesser-known 19th-century preference by black artisans for strips and blocks in quilts. In Appalachia, the cornhusk dolls from the 1920's seem modern, too, as fashionably dressed as F. Scott Fitzgerald characters.
The sources of African-American material seem more difficult to pinpoint. Indeed, the scrolled-iron grillwork, the colorful ceramics splashed with vivid washes or florals, as well as the quilts, seem to replicate those made by white artisans. The exhibition fails to show or report how blacks developed their own crafts in the 18th and 19th centuries.
As for scope, this museum project is certainly daring. Chock-full of information about the people who produced and distributed crafts, the exhibition nevertheless leaves the viewer with more questions than answers.
"This is a period that needs more work by scholars," Mrs. Kardon said. "Being the first ones out there to do such an exhibition, we may get clobbered, but it will be worth it. We want to raise questions that will invite further discussion."

HEADLINE: On the Weicker Watch: Stand Up or Stand Back?

SERIES: Kirk Johnson, a reporter for The New York Times, covered the election campaign and administrationof Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
AS a reporter covering Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in Hartford, it was wise to get a firm and early grasp on the coded format of his news conferences: Would the Governor be standing in front of the fireplace? Seated behind his desk? On the couch? Each variation carried a hidden message about the tone of the event and whether or not you could expect to have your head handed back to you for asking any particular question.
The couch was almost always best. It conveyed informality. The reporters sat. Mr. Weicker took his jacket off, and when he sank down into the cushions, his pants rode up his ankles, exposing his socks and making him seem almost folksy, or in any case less formidable. 
 Seated-at-his-desk news conferences were the next most preferable. In the chair, with television cameras bearing down from the front and the reporters all standing, it was possible to create and briefly sustain the illusion that Mr. Weicker was surrounded. He could be pressed on things.
A stand-up at the fireplace was a wild card, though not as unpredictable as the hallway ambush, where you didn't have a clue until the first question whether the Weicker you encountered would be brusquely dismissive at the stupidity of your questions or thoughtfully eloquent.
In a fireplace news conference, everyone stood, and the distance between the 6-foot-6 chief executive and the -- by comparison -- diminutive reporters of the capitol press corps was, by my guess, about two long strides on his part, if he ever chose to close the distance. In any event you were inescapably aware that he was on his feet, mobile, ready for action.
The bottom line of the Weicker years, though, was that tea leaves and guesswork was all you had to go on. The Governor's mercurial, essentially unpredictable nature -- what would set him off, what his next surprise legislative proposal would be, even, in the end, what made him go -- defined his administration and his every move within it.
From the bombshell announcement in his first budget in 1991 that he would break one of the longest running political taboos in Connecticut and propose a tax on wages, through his sudden announcement last year that he would not seek a second term, tracking the Weicker trajectory was often a lot like watching a Punch and Judy show. At any moment, somebody might jump out of nowhere, hollering. You had to be ready, and you learned to watch for the telling Weicker moment.

 Just before noon on Oct. 5, 1991, despite the anguished pleadings of his State Police body guards, the Governor walked directly into the middle of one the biggest and loudest protest rallies in modern Connecticut history.
The state's new income tax, which Mr. Weicker fathered, had just started biting paychecks, and about 40,000 people had gathered on the capitol grounds to shriek. Straw-stuffed Weicker dolls were hanging in effigy from the trees.
And when the protesters saw that the man himself had had the effrontery to enter their midst, they erupted. They screamed, they waved signs and fists, they hurled obscenities directly into the Governor's smiling, placid face as he moved out among them, surrounded by his ring of tense troopers.
Afterward, in the muted marble calm of the capitol, Mr. Weicker explained that as a point of democratic principle he would not be stopped by anyone from walking on public grounds where and when he chose. If people were vile enough to try and spit on him, as they had, so be it. But anyone who'd seen his face out there, at the center of all that wrath, knew the real truth: He'd enjoyed every minute of it -- reveled in it, like a boy stirring up a hornet's nest with a stick.

 In early 1993, press aides invited reporters to an early morning news conference in the Governor's office. The event had been described only cryptically as having something to do with the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe, but it was made clear that one would best be advised to be there. The Governor was behind his desk, flanked by tribe members and attorneys. A sheaf a papers was distributed.
Gradually, as we read, the truth dawned: The Pequots, operators of the state's only casino, Foxwoods, in Ledyard, had agreed to voluntarily give over 25 percent of their slot machine revenue to the state -- so long as the tribe had no competition from Las Vegas and Atlantic City interlopers like Stephen A. Wynn or Donald Trump. In a single master stroke, Mr. Weicker -- a steadfast opponent of expanded gambling -- had crippled the movement to authorize a casino in Bridgeport.
Afterward, the pro-gambling legislators and lobbyists were just like the protestors on the lawn: red-faced, utterly flummoxed and outfoxed.

 But the reactions Mr. Weicker produced in people through his long public career -- from the Connecticut legislature in the early 1960's through the United States Congress, including three terms in the Senate -- were vivid at the other end of the spectrum as well. The people who love Mr. Weicker almost seem to worship him.
Many apparently fell for him in the 1970's, when as a Republican Senator during the Watergate Committee hearings he became a symbol of the lonely warrior, defending the Constitution from those in his own party who would subvert it. Through battles with fellow Republicans like Jesse Helms, he came to be seen as a man of the big gesture and the broad defense of moral principle in a world that often seemed populated with men and women of small-minded expedience. People gradually began to expect to be moved or enraged by whatever he did, and I think maybe Mr. Weicker also felt a need as time went on not to disappoint them.
On the day in Greenwich when he said he would not run for a second four-year term as Governor, the woman next to me in the audience suddenly began to cry. She explained that she somehow just knew -- in driving from Litchfield County to be there -- that this would be Mr. Weicker's decision. She was prepared: Her tissue was up her sleeve, ready for duty.

 But Mr. Weicker's famous truculence -- not to mention his penchant for scatological metaphors in describing his dissatisfaction with the legislature's work product -- was also, on very rare occasions, lifted to reveal the vulnerability beneath.
Over the course of his campaign in 1990, for example, and through his term in office, I wrote stories that described his arrogance and his intolerance of dissent.
But it wasn't until I wrote that perhaps not all of his thoughts were utterly and profoundly original that he hit the roof. The offending reference occurred in a story about a speech he gave to the General Assembly in 1993.
I wrote -- innocuously enough, I thought -- that the Governor's language about the urgent need to desegregate Connecticut's racially and economically divided public schools strongly resembled remarks recently given in court by the plaintiffs in the Sheff v. O'Neill integration lawsuit then -- as now -- raging in Hartford Superior Court.
The next day, Mr. Weicker cornered me and after rising, it seemed, to well beyond his full height, said he felt I'd accused him of plagiarism, that every word of his speeches was written by no one but himself, and that he resented any other implication.
I swallowed once and said I had intended nothing of the sort, but had only been pointing out the interesting parallel -- that Connecticut's chief executive would take an almost identical line as the people who are suing him to overhaul the school system. I encouraged him to call my editors if he wanted to complain further.
But his anger, like a brief, severe squall at sea, was already spent. "Forget about it," he said. "It's over."
Then, on the spot he granted me an exclusive, if utterly impromptu, interview. But no couch this time. He sat behind his desk. I took a chair in front.

HEADLINE: Q. & A.;
A Key Fee: What Can Tenant Do?

 BODY:

Q What kind of legal action can I take against the former tenant of my rent-stabilized apartment for the key fee he charged me? The former tenant (who is not a real-estate broker) put a classified advertisement in a newspaper describing his apartment and the fact that a low fee would be charged. 
 I responded to the ad and was told by the tenant that in order to apply for the apartment, I had to pay him a fee equal to one month's rent. Having no choice if I wanted a shot at the apartment, I agreed and signed a document indicating my understanding that this fee had nothing to do with the landlord and any lease-related negotiations, but that it would be returned to me if the application was not approved.
It turns out that the former tenant had broken his lease and made a deal with the landlord whereby he would find a suitable tenant to take over the apartment. . . . G. Masoni, Manhattan.
 A In New York, key money is illegal, said Eric Davis, a Manhattan lawyer. "A demand for key money is generally unenforceable," Mr. Davis said, "and if it is paid, the party paying the key money has legal recourse against the party receiving it."
A licensed real-estate broker may charge a commission for the rental or sale of real property, even if the broker has an interest in that property, though generally such circumstances require disclosure by the broker, Mr. Davis said. A nonbroker is not permitted to charge a commission.
Mr. Davis said the writer had two possible avenues of recourse: taking the previous tenant to court or filing an overcharge complaint against him with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which oversees rent administration in the city.
Lou Ganim, a spokesman for D.H.C.R., said that such a fee associated with the rental of an apartment evades the intent of the Rent Stabilization Law. Mr. Davis said the writer should contact the D.H.C.R.'s Office of Rent Administration, Lower Manhattan Borough Office, 156 William Street, 9th floor, telephone number: (212) 240-6008.
 
Entering Apartment Of Deceased Tenant
Q Can a building-owner's employee enter the apartment of a deceased tenant and remove any item without the permission of the executors of the estate of the deceased person?
What action if any may I take as executrix? The office and owners of the building were well aware that I am the executrix and knew where to reach me. I live in one of the buildings owned by the same person who owns the building where the deceased lived. . . . Brenda Tharpe, Manhattan.
 A The mere fact that a tenant dies does not allow a landlord or the landlord's agent to enter the tenant's apartment, said Michael Finder, a Manhattan lawyer.
"The landlord has to go to court," Mr. Finder said.
In fact, he said, if the deceased tenant had been occupying the apartment under a written lease "the death of the tenant does not terminate the lease, and the executrix would have the right to have the estate occupy the apartment for the balance of the lease, for winding up affairs of the estate."
If the decedent was a rent-controlled tenant without a written lease, he said, "the mere death of the tenant, without a surrender of the apartment by the executrix or without court proceedings, would not allow a landlord to simply take back possession of the apartment."
In any event, Mr. Finder said, assuming there have been no court proceedings, if the landlord's agent or employee in this case wrongfully entered the apartment and wrongfully took the decedent's possessions, "the executrix should file a criminal complaint."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT;
Caffeine and Crackdowns: Dispatches From '94

 BODY:
STATIONED in the sky, the eye of a camera sweeping across New York would have looked down at a cranky but energized city in 1994. Its residents hungering for order, the civic life of New York's neighborhoods evolved as both prickly and aggressive, amounting to a stiffening of civic resolve that sought control over the streets and an erasure of the decades-old impulse of shrugging off disorder. Hearts hardened; community meetings often turned ugly.
Feeding off new commercial life swelling in neighborhoods from SoHo to the Upper West Side, Manhattan had a crisper feel, perhaps caffeinated by the new-style coffee bars that cropped up on some streets three at a time. Huge stores took over the empty hulks that were the dreams of turn-of the-century retailers. Themes and hooks were demanded, and the rollicking permutations of capitalism sometimes took bizarre forms. Televisions turned up above urinals in restaurants. One nightclub owner decided to have an earthquake night: the place shook at midnight as Los Angeles video imagery abounded. When the venture failed, he tried a Latin American earthquake and the imagery turned Cuban. 
 The city headed into 1995 with pockets of energy and new confidence but with the local economy still weak in key areas and residents about to feel the affects of the contraction of the municipal budget. In a special report, the reporters and editors of The City present a survey of 1994 -- not from aloft but from down on the ground in the neighborhoods -- with an eye toward what the key local issues are likely to be in 1995.
 
LOWER MANHATTAN
 
Emergency Care on Wall Street
 
 Here was a neighborhood with an identity crisis. Once the beating heart of the greed decade, the financial district continued the hemorrhage that has cost 100,000 jobs below Chambers Street in the last seven years and left vacancy rates of up to 25 percent in some of the same buildings that once represented New York's power and virility on the world scene. With real-estate interests stung and a vacuum of leadership, a Business Improvement District was formed to avoid obsolescence by diversifying the area away from financial services and into more of a 24-hour neighborhood. At year's end, the Giuliani administration offered what could be the city's largest development proposal in more than 10 years, a package that included tax breaks, zoning changes and an express taxi lane. Around town some grumbled that the plan was a bailout that could just as well have been offered to other areas. The proposal now goes to the City Council.

CHINATOWN
 
Changing Tongs
 
 "I'm late for the doctor," a frail Benny Ong told a reporter in June as two bodyguards helped him to a waiting car on Pell Street, the narrow alley where he was said to run his extortion rackets and gambling dens, and where he gained his nickname "hatchet man" for his skill with an ax. Two months later, as Mr. Ong made his final trip through Chinatown in a funeral procession with 120 black limousines, the streets were silent in reverence. The death of the 87-year-old "Godfather of Chinatown," the adviser-in-chief of the Hip Sing Association, represented the end of the era of old-time Chinese organized-crime leaders. These days, Chinese crime has focused on new quarries -- the smuggling of Fujianese immigrants and the peddling of heroin -- and has become less centralized, with loosely formed gangs practicing extortion around the city. The tongs, now wishing to be called associations, even began a campaign to cleanse their image as tools of gangsters. All in all, continued prosecutions may have shaken up some organized-crime pockets.
 
Parade Politics
 
 It seems obligatory these days that an ethnic parade be tangled in controversy. This year it was Chinatown's turn. The first official pro-mainland parade ran through the neighborhood in September, its very presence a looming challenge to Chinatown's established pro-Nationalist leadership. But the leaders of the mainland parade cried favoritism when the police gave them a route outside the traditional center of Chinatown. They were also angry that Capt. Thomas M. Chan of the Fifth Precinct did not march in their parade but had a prominent spot a few weeks later in the annual Nationalist parade, which was granted its usual central Chinatown route. Look for the parades to be an issue again this year.
 
SOHO/TRIBECA
 
Smoothing the Edges
 
 The sidewalks were jammed. Tourists poured in. Shoppers browsed. Broadway had a furious pace below Houston Street. To some lament, the cyclical waves of the city economy turned SoHo, once a manufacturing district and then a frontier home for artist/pioneers, into a location for Armani A/X and Lechters Housewares and an international marketplace for style and design. As if to punctuate the trend, Hartz Mountain announced in December that it would build a large hotel on Grand Street.
For its part, TriBeCa continued to grow as a restaurant district. Robert De Niro, who has blended his hip star image with the low rents below Canal to create what amounts to a new film district, was a partner in a very hot new restaurant, Nobu, and planned a bakery. Down the block, Bubby's became a lunchtime scene; one film executive called it "the East Coast Polo Lounge."
 
LOWER EAST SIDE/EAST VILLAGE
 
ABC's of Gentrification
 
 Renewing interest that flickered briefly in the go-go 1980's, investors are now plowing money into this once-grungy street, giving it a more trendy look, with boutiques and designer food. But even with a tamer Tompkins Square Park, the old Haight Ashbury feel isn't completely gone. And entrepreneurial inspiration can still be offbeat, as evidenced by the opening of the club Babyland, with its infantilism motif: naked Barbie dolls, a Playskool bar and mooing doors.

Master of the Brawl
 
Already known for the city's wildest and toughest brand of politics, these neighborhoods now have one of the city's most controversial politicians: Councilman Antonio Pagan. Gay, Hispanic and relatively conservative, the 35-year-old lawyer opposes low-income housing and many new social services. He has aroused such venom with his acid tongue that one local paper regularly portrays him as a cockroach; political opponents have hit him with defamation suits. Others say he is dedicated and gets things done, using his aggressive manner in many neighborhood causes. He lost one important battle when his close ally, William E. Ubinas, was deposed as superintendent of School District 1 after a tumultuous fight.

Target: The Squatters
 
Housing policy often amounts to triage, and perhaps nowhere is this more evident than on East 13th Street, where squatters are encamped in five city-owned tenements. Over the years officials have largely let these and other squatters around the city alone, but with thousands of people on waiting lists for low-rent apartments, housing officials want the buildings back. The 13th Street battle, now in the courts, has been furiously fought. At one community board meeting the squatters and their supporters caused such pandemonium that board members had to retreat behind a barrier of a dozen shield-bearing police officers to vote yes on the city's plans.
 
NOHO
 
Reassessing Astor Place
 
 Just as development smoothed out Avenue A, it began to alter the faintly industrial feel of Astor Place. Conran's closed, Cooper Square Books departed and the Greek-style diner, the Astor Riviera Cafe, shut its doors. What is coming in tells much about Asian investment in the city and the spate of large discount stores and coffee bars. The newcomers: a Barnes & Noble, taking over Conran's; Starbucks, the Seattle-based coffee chain, subsuming the Riviera, and loft-style apartments in the old District 65 union building, courtesy of a group from China.
 
WEST VILLAGE
 
It's All in the Details
 
 "You take care of the little things, and the big things take care of themselves," said Capt. Peter Cassidy, executive officer of the Sixth Precinct. And so this area, which is deluged with young people each weekend, particularly on Eighth Street, became an experiment in quality-of-life enforcement. This meant increased patrolling, stepped-up enforcement using computers to track violators, and more summonses for minor offenses, like noisy portable radios, graffiti vandalism and unlicensed vending. Some progress was reported in the area, and the police decided to expand the program elsewhere in the city.

The Tolerance Envelope
 
Neighbors in one of New York's most historically tolerant communities decided they had reached their limit of tolerance when a physician, Dr. Joyce Wallace, sought to open a home for reforming prostitutes in her West 13th Street brownstone. The proposal was killed.
 
CHELSEA
 
Doubly Pleased in Chelsea
 
 In the give and take of New York's neighborhoods, Chelsea found itself on the receiving end of economic and geographic changes in two sometimes overlapping communities -- the city's gay world and its art world. Symbolizing a northward shift of gay life, a Different Light, a bookstore that is a cultural hub in gay literary circles, moved from the West Village to 19th Street. In some people's minds, Eighth Avenue has now supplanted Christopher Street as the city's main gay thoroughfare, a notion largely confirmed by the crowds that poured into Chelsea during the Gay Games.
Farther west, amid the warehouses and factory buildings clustered about 10th Avenue, West Chelsea began to emerge as a serious player in the city's art scene. Several new galleries and dozens of studios opened, and more are coming. The area is attracting artists fleeing SoHo's high rents and galleries from 57th Street and Madison Avenue. The locals farther east, often intimidated by the goings-on across 10th Avenue, are pleased.

Life on the Pier
 
The reconstruction of the Chelsea Piers, between 17th and 22d Streets, took shape. Soon to come: a sports club, two indoor ice-skating rinks, a park and a mammoth Herman's sporting-goods store.
 
FLATIRON/UNION SQUARE
 
A New Space Age
 
 Large available spaces, rents substantially lower than midtown's and the decision of large suburban superstores to overcome their fears of Manhattan: Around the Flatiron, these were the ingredients of a throbbing blend of urban funk, suburban shopping and what is probably the city's hottest restaurant district. Bradlees opened in Union Square, and Toys "R" Us arrived, too. And in what could provide fuel for preservationists forever, a new generation of superstores needing big, uncut spaces reclaimed the grand old landmarked retail mammoths along the old Ladies Mile, Avenue of the Americas below 23d Street. On the restaurant front, places like Gramercy Tavern, Patria and C. T. were defining a new New York style of dining.
 
STUYVESANT TOWN/GRAMERCY PARK
 
Socially Saturated?
 
 In few areas was the nastiness of "quality-of-life" battles so apparent. People on Irving Place and environs, already feeling aggrieved by scores of social-service programs in the area, fought the move by a nonprofit group, Community Access, to create housing for the mentally ill on East 18th Street. When the bank that owned the building backed out, three residents who opposed the project were ordered to turn over their personal diaries, petitions and phone messages as part of a Federal investigation into whether antidiscrimination housing laws had been broken. Civil libertarians and others accused the government of conducting a witchhunt that would have a chilling effect on community protest. The housing proposal died in the courts last week. . . . Up on East 23d, residents had been exasperated for years by the legal system's sluggishness in responding to the situation at the Kenmore Hotel, where roving bands of
drug dealers took over entire floors, elderly people were robbed and sometimes killed and prostitutes plied their trade. Last June, the neighborhood's pleas were answered when Federal authorities seized the hotel and turned it over to private management.
 
MIDTOWN
 
The Disney Regeneration
 
 Since the early days of the century, the Theater District has been as much a territory of the mind as a physical location, a kind of pleasure center in the national brain, an engine of mass culture, theaters, television, publishing and music. That was before the area turned into a playground for prostitutes, pornography and runaway teen-agers, a concentration that left the city with an international reputation for municipal incontinence. Last year, the shape of the future came more into focus. The 42d Street redevelopment moved along as storefronts continued to empty out and condemnation guns were put to the heads of porn shop owners, opening the way, if the economy holds, for a new generation of theaters, offices and a hotel. The neighborhood's larger role as an office district -- serving law firms and financial services -- was underscored by the imminent arrival of Morgan Stanley and its 10,000 jobs. The new Times Square appears cleaner on the ground (up high, the towering Gulliver in the Calvin Klein ad would have astonished Ratso Rizzo), better lighted and better patrolled. And in a seminal move that could affect the tone of 42d Street for decades, Disney staked its flag on the New Amsterdam Theater, and MTV indicated that it would build a studio complex and a restaurant. Other entertainment folks are expected to follow. What lies ahead for the nation's psyche remains to be seen. But if Walter Winchell mind-melding with Texas Guinan at El Fey seven decades ago transmogrified into a national culture of celebrity, one wonders what new form will emerge from the mingling of an MTV producer with a Disney director and a Morgan Stanley analyst belly up at the bar at the flamboyant new hotel across from the Port Authority.
 
Celestial Real Estate
 
 Few topics engendered as virulent a debate as 57th Street, a boulevard with a rep once draped in Tiffany but now a noun phrase for $9 hamburgers and Tom and Jerry. With a Warner Brother's studio store, the Harley-Davidson Cafe, the Hard Rock Cafe, the Sony Arcade nearby on Madison Avenue and the coming of the restaurant Jekyll & Hyde, the street has alerted, among some, a deep atavistic New York fear of cultural colonization by Hollywood. Better pretension than superficiality, they say. Thumbing their noses at the critics, those desiring earsplitting music and coveting the Porky the Pig doll came anyway, helping Fifth Avenue to edge Tokyo's Ginza as the most expensive place in the world to rent retail space. As a further thumb-in-the-eye, the Hollywood Zeuses Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg were trying at year's end to maneuver into 20,000 feet at 120 West 57th Street, a place to park another Dive!, their Los Angeles restaurant.
 
UPPER EAST SIDE
 
A Private Affair?
 
So deep did the fear of crime cut, despite falling crime statistics, that an extraordinary idea emerged on the Upper East Side: blanket the area from 59th to 86th Streets with a security force of 500 guards and pay for it with property taxes raised through a special assessment district. Around the city, private security has taken on a much greater role in recent years, but this was by far the most extensive rendition yet. Propelled by the prominent realtor Douglas Elliman and such local institutions as the Dalton School, which had become unnerved by the increasing number of muggings of students, the proposal drew heated debate and exposed neighborhood divisions. Underscoring the particular brand of populism that holds real estate interests in suspicion in the generally well-off neighborhood, many block associations opposed the move, in part because of the image of elitism it would feed.
Opinion even had a territorial dimension, with the tonier west side of Lexington Avenue more amenable to the plan than the east. Opposition rested on several grounds: the elitist argument; the cost, and the worry that increasing private security would encourage the police to shift their resources to other neighborhoods. By the end of the year the plan seemed in grave jeopardy.

 
The Rail Link
 
The East Side found itself smack in the middle of a major regional question: plans for an airport rail link with a terminus below the old Alexander's building at 59th and Lexington Avenue. With Federal funds at least partially committed, the project would address the agony and expense of the sometimes circuitous cab rides from J.F.K. and La Guardia Airports that amount to an informal tax on tourist and business travel in the city. But many voices rose in opposition, angered by the prospect of adding to the already excruciating traffic in the area. With protests expressed along the route in Queens, the project raised the issue posed by those who fondly remember the authoritarian approach of Robert Moses: can a major project be built in New York anymore?

UPPER WEST SIDE
 
Super Square
 
Is midtown moving northward? Already buzzing with traffic and pedestrians, feeding off the energy of the Lincoln Center fountains and the music buffs at Tower Records, Lincoln Square could never be described as sleepy. But the crossing of Broadway and Columbus Avenues began to emerge as one of Manhattan's most important centers of gravity with the first signs of three projects by Millenium Partners, by far the largest new development in the city. In total, 540,000 square feet of retail space is being built, including a vast Reebok gymnasium and another Barnes & Noble superstore, along with 600 rental or condominium apartments. Manhattan's largest movie theater has already arrived -- Sony Lincoln Square, with nine screens plus an eight-story-high Imax screen that shows films in three dimensions.
Perhaps lulled by the desultory real estate climate of the early 1990's and a body politic thirsting for investment and tax revenues, the neighborhood awoke late to the impact of the project. The bottom line: This new wave of development -- which also comprises Donald J. Trump's huge Riverside South development from 59th to 72d Street, the 1,000-apartment Manhattan West complex and Mr. Trump's remodeling of the former Gulf & Western Building at Columbus Circle -- could bring 13,000 new residential units to the area in just a few years.
 
'No Mas,' Liberally
 
There was no better gauge for the growing resistance to social-service programs than on the Upper West Side, with its long history of tolerance and liberal voting patterns. This year many in the neighborhood where Larry Hogue made his rounds decided they had had enough; some said even a midday walk with their children in baby carriages had a threatening air. At meetings, nonprofit leaders were shouted down with the same anger reserved for pro-war speakers 20 years before.
By one count, 80 social-service programs sat between West 90th and 110th Streets. Protests forced the Volunteers of America, a nonprofit group, to halve the number of chronically mentally ill homeless in a new site at Broadway and 101st Street. Fifteen blocks to the south, a plan to move homeless people into Euclid Hall also sparked protests.
In true contentious Upper West Side fashion, the Euclid opposition was split into three groups. "You must remember," said Joseph Levie, a lawyer associated with two of the groups, "that you are dealing with West Siders who can find an issue of principle about how they put on their eyeglasses."

Upper West Siders can be terriers. Seeking smooth shooting along Central Park West for a parade scene, the producers of "Miracle on 34th Street" made a number of peace offerings -- including a donation to the West 76th Street Block Association. "It's a very vocal neighborhood with very articulate people who know where power lies in this city," said Amy Sultan of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting. . . . Major reconstruction work on Columbus Avenue caused major headaches. City officials said they might be able to finish the project a year early, by November.
 
HARLEM
 
The Scandal
 
It may have failed to capture the public psyche as the rebel-underdog Serpico did in the early 70's, but for sheer numbers and pervasiveness, there has been nothing else in the Police Department's 146-year history to match the scandal in the 30th Precinct: nearly one of every six officers arrested in what seems the particular brand of late-20th century police corruption spawned by the spread of heroin and cocaine: bands of officers stealing drugs and money from dealers. Perhaps because the victims themselves were drug dealers and some of the officers were actually considered effective elsewhere on their rounds, there was just enough moral ambiguity to squash a good-vs.-evil story line.
But the message was not lost on the department's hierarchy, which had to deal with the notion that such widespread lawlessness went unnoticed, or at least unreported, by the precinct's leadership. In fact two of the arrestees were sergeants, one of whom, Kevin P. Nunnery, was charged with leading an eight-team unit on a two-year binge of illegal apartment and car break-ins. The unit even had a name: Nunnery's Raiders. The department cleaned house and tried to mend fences with Harlem residents, but the reaction of residents at a goodwill meeting showed how far the precinct had to go: A longtime resident said afterward, "I don't think corruption is gone from the precinct, but I didn't want to say anything." She said she feared retribution.
 
The Vendors
 
In a local political culture built on a foundation of immigration, the idea of sweeping the streets of street vendors has always lent itself to soul-searching. But so congested have some streets become in recent years that when the city began toughening its stance, the body politic basically stood back and watched, with the few vocal objections coming from the vendors themselves. The Armageddon of this policy came on Oct. 17, when the police swept across Harlem's main boulevard, 125th Street, arresting 22 vendors. The sweep had wide support among Harlem's business and political leadership. The vendors were relocated to a lot at 116th Street and Lenox Avenue. Business, they say, is terrible.

After much deliberation, lobbying and interborough warfare with the Bronx, Harlem became part of a Federal empowerment zone that also includes Washington Heights, Inwood and the South Bronx. Now the hard part: what is likely to be brutal trench warfare over division of the $300 million in spoils. . . . Ralph Ellison, author of "Invisible Man," died at 80, largely unknown to the people in his neighborhood on upper Riverside Drive. "And it's a shame, too," said his postman, John B. Weaver. "He should have been king here."
 
WASHINGTON HEIGHTS/INWOOD
 
Wanted: Breathing Space
 
Around the city, rising enrollment and the budget crunch have put pressure on a number of school districts, leaving classrooms jammed and children learning in odd places. School District 6 in Upper Manhattan is one of the most crowded, complicating the logistics of education in a district with a school population that is 50 percent bilingual, the largest percentage in the state. The district's school population has risen from 21,000 to 26,000 in seven years and is expected to keep growing by 1,200 to 1,500 students a year. It is so crowded that this year 1,300 of its students were bused outside the district, some students eat in 20-minute shifts and some sit 37 in a classroom. Three new schools were ready to open last fall, to at least briefly relieve the overcrowding, but the money wasn't available.

BROWNSTONE BROOKLYN
 
On the Waterfront
 
 Not an awful lot has actually happened there over the recent years, but the Brooklyn Heights waterfront -- or, more specifically, what to do with it -- is a perpetually, loomingly big story around the neighborhood. The reason, quite simply, is a widespread fear that development will mean losing the passionately prized Promenade view that ties the Heights's identity as much to Manhattan as to the eastward vastness of Brooklyn. 
 After years of stalemate, 1994 brought stirrings of a solution to the waterfront. The Port Authority agreed to sell the piers to the State Urban Development Corporation. Reconstruction began at Fulton Ferry nearby. And just before Election Day, Governor Cuomo announced the formation of a panel -- intended to represent a diversity of interests -- to come up with a plan for the area based on 13 "planning principles" drafted by members of the community and its elected officials. Around the Heights, a big question for the new year is whether the new man in Albany, the Republican George E. Pataki, will keep the process on track.
 
St. George's School?
 
 The St. George Hotel, rambling grand dame of the Heights turned S.R.O. (and source of much neighborhood angst), found itself the source of more neighborhood angst. The Board of Education, caught between its experimental ambitions and worsening financial straits, proposed making the St. George home to one of its new specialized high schools, the Science Skills Center. But when word got out that the board was planning to vote on the matter before presenting it to the community, the community reacted with outrage. Ultimately, Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines withdrew the plan, citing concerns about the monitoring of the hotel's social services, among other issues.
 
Business, Big and Small
 
 The Giuliani administration's crackdown against illegal street vendors, greeted with such bitter resistance along 125th Street in Harlem, had mellower results on the Fulton Mall. With most of the 300 or so vendors gone from the mall, crime dropped, local merchants beamed and some of the vendors even began working with the police on a plan to set up a legal peddlers' market nearby. A grander effort to increase business downtown, the Atlantic Center commercial development near the Long Island Rail Road terminal, suffered a bit of a blow as the planned cornerstone store, Bradlee's, decided not to move in. The developers, Forest City Ratner, played down the decision, saying they were deep in talks with another retailer and would begin construction this year.
 
Express Mail?
 
 Even in a city where people have come to expect and accept less than speedy or polite mail service, the complaints were alarming: from downtown Brooklyn to Red Hook, people told of credit card bills never received, fruit that arrived three months late, a postal manager who suggested to a customer that complaints would only make service worse. In October, as part of a broad effort to put the service back in the Postal Service, Brooklyn got a new Postmaster, Antonio Corso, who promptly began cleaning house and promised to have the situation straightened out by January. Happy New Year, Mr. Postmaster!
 
You Say CAP-uh-Cheeno
 
 The coffee bar, the aggressively American knock-off of the Italian espresso bar, arrived with a vengeance in the traditionally Italian, and more recently young professional, neighborhoods of Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens. Some of the old-timers simply decided to go with the flow. "We've got 60 kids of coffee now. Two years ago, it was just two types: black and brown," said Frank D'Amico, who turned the back of his Court Street salumeria, D'Amico Foods, into a self-service coffee bar. But other longtime residents would not be moved. "They think they're trendy and new, but they're not," said Anthony Spada, a local real-estate agent, taking pains to point out that an espresso with steamed milk and foam on top is a "CUH-puh-cheeno."
 
NORTH BROOKLYN
 
Pollution, Pollution
 
 The Brooklyn Navy Yard -- polluted over the course of 150 years of shipbuilding, but newly returned to life as a busy manufacturing zone -- has long been a focus of concern around Williamsburg, perhaps the city's most environmentally blighted, and environmentally active, neighborhood. The year brought a mix of bad and good news, at least from the perspective of the bitter opponents of a garbage-burning incinerator planned for the yard: elevated levels of lead, arsenic and cadmium were found in soil and groundwater near the incinerator site, prompting a series of investigations and the revelation that the city had failed to reveal the discovery of toxic waste on the site six years ago.
The "good news": city officials put the incinerator project on hold, pending the investigations, which could also result in the site's placement on the state's Superfund list. And just weeks ago, the area gained an environmental watchdog: Barry Commoner's Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College.
 
Banneker's Blues
 
 The Science Skills Center, rebuffed in its bid to move into the St. George, was not the only experimental high school with housing problems. The Benjamin Banneker Academy for Community Development, devoted to urban planning and design, faced the loss of its lease in a dispute with its landlord, Pratt Institute. While Pratt ultimately let Banneker stay, the incident underlined the logistical growing pains faced by some of the new schools.
 
Vox Redux: Phone Theft
 
 What will they steal next? For Jean John and her neighbors in Bedford-Stuyvesant, the answer was long-distance telephone calls, thousands of dollars' worth of them, stolen by vandals breaking into the boxes that connect home lines to underground phone wires, charged to the unwitting customers. At first, the phone company refused to drop the charges; after calls from The New York Times and an inspection at Ms. John's building on Macon Street, Nynex and A.T.&T. relented.
 
SOUTHERN BROOKLYN
 
Strains of Immigration
 
 In the old and insular Italian and Irish communities of Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst, the strains of new immigration were apparent. In Bensonhurst, now home to thousands of Russians, longtime merchants protested the use of Russian-only store signs as "un-American."
In Bay Ridge -- where fears of economic competition from Asian, Arab, Russian and Hispanic newcomers has helped produce what the police and community leaders say is rising alienation, rage and violence among young whites -- the evidence was far more raw: a 40-year-old Ecuadorean immigrant was beaten to death in Dyker Beach Park by a gang of white teen-agers enraged over an earlier dispute with other Hispanic men. The boys, the police said, shouted anti-Hispanic epithets as they beat their victim with baseball bats and table legs. "Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, you see craziness taking over kids of all neighborhoods," said Michael Vitale, a senior at Xaverian High School, a private Catholic school for boys. "I don't see a way of figuring out how to stop it. Not our generation."
 
Fast Road to Repair?
 
 The reconstruction of the Gowanus Expressway was still more than two years away, but around southwest Brooklyn, plenty of people were already plenty worried. The news that, under conventional construction schedules, the work and the traffic trauma would last 8 to 13 years prompted fears of neighborhood economic disaster and threats of legal action. Citing those concerns, and perhaps sensitized by public-relations fiascos elsewhere in the city, the city's Department of Transportation said it was trying to find ways to speed the process. A precise schedule and environmental-impact statement are due by spring.
 
Sheepshead Bay Memories
 
 In its prime, Lundy's was truly a seafood palace, the vast cornerstone of the bustling quays along Emmons Avenue in Sheepshead Bay, and just as its death in the late 70's became the emblem of the avenue's decline, the hopes of its reincarnation have long been the dreamstuff of the strip's rebound. Last spring, something more than talk actually happened: workers began a renovation that developers say they hope will bring not only a new Lundy's, but also offices and stores to Emmons Avenue. Another proposal, for a 27,000-square-foot Loehmann's store next door, remains in limbo, caught between those who argue that it would be a major economic draw and those who say it would destroy Sheepshead Bay's centuries-old maritime character. The store's first bid for a zoning variance was turned down; an appeal is in the offing.
 
Not Next to Our Temple
 
 It is far from rare for a fast-food restaurant to run up against local opposition. Traffic, litter, the danger to a neighborhood's character: These are the usual fears, and people in Flatbush made them known when McDonald's sought and received city approval to open an outlet on 18th Avenue. But this McDonald's also brought protests of a different kind: in addition to quality-of-life concerns, local Jewish leaders, including City Councilman Noach Dear, complained that the proposed location, just yards from an Orthodox synagogue, was inappropriate; they also requested Sabbath closings and a kosher menu. McDonald's, for its part, said it was eager to work with the community, but ruled out such concessions. The restaurant opened last week, with the standard McDonald's menu.
 
X-Rated Neighbors
 
 The citywide anger over the spread of X-rated businesses spread to Sunset Park. In the last two years, more than a dozen topless bars and sex-video stores have opened between 30th and 40th Streets and Third and Fourth Avenues. Residents have rallied and petitioned, and they see some hope in a City Hall plan to keep sex businesses out of residential areas. Still, the established businesses remain, along with the anger.
 
Footnotes
 
 More contention on the parade front: asserting its Irish, Bay Ridge held its first St. Patrick's Day Parade and drew barbs from the organizers of Brooklyn's original Irish parade, in Park Slope. . . . The wandering soccer field -- $80,000 worth of artificial turf that the Norwegian Government gave to Red Hook, where teen-agers promptly set it on fire -- was next offered to Bay Ridge, where the community board, afraid of congestion and general mayhem, decided not to decide till February or so. . . . One Coney Island dream actually took a step toward reality: Plans were announced for a sports complex on the old Steeplechase grounds. Next battleground: Albany. . . . In Gravesend, garbage dumping in vacant lots and along railroad tracks brought rats in droves. "They're eating good and they're housed well," said Assemblyman Frank J. Barbaro.
 
EASTERN BROOKLYN
 
Redistricting Angst
 
 Drawing new district lines is one of the most delicate of political procedures. This was evident in school districts around the city, and especially in southeast Brooklyn, where the Board of Education, trying to increase minority representation on one local school board, ended up making nearly everyone -- black and white -- angry. Though the district, No. 18, in East Flatbush and Canarsie, is 72 percent black, only two of nine board members are. The central board proposed to rectify the situation by trading off schools with the neighboring district, No. 22, which covers Manhattan Beach, Midwood and Flatbush, to create two largely segregated districts.
Instead, the plan created anger and fear -- of programs disrupted and money lost -- as well as divisions among black residents: in District 18, many black parents said they opposed the plan's details but supported its intent; in District 22, which is 44 percent black but has no black board members, many cited a spirit of cooperation and said they simply wanted to stay where they were. "I grew up with segregation," said one parents' association member. "I don't want to see it again." Next stop: the drawing board. . . . A neighboring district, No. 17 in Crown Heights, was taken over last month by Chancellor Cortines, who said political infighting and mismanagement had compromised the education there.
 
After the Rebbe
 
 The death, in June, of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem M. Schneerson, removed a feeble yet powerful figure from the city's religious and political landscape, and brought grief, religious division and, perhaps most of all, uncertainty to the Hasidic residents of Crown Heights. Who might emerge as his successor? Is the Messiah's coming at hand? Would the Lubavitchers' political influence endure? One nagging and locally painful question was answered, though: the Federal Government decided to bring civil-rights charges against Lemrick Nelson Jr., the man a state jury acquitted of killing Yankel Rosenbaum during the Crown Heights disturbances in 1991.
 
In the Crime Lab
 
 Many years, the 75th Precinct in East New York has been one of the city's murder capitals. Last spring, it became a laboratory for some of the crime-fighting strategies that the Giuliani administration now says are contributing to a significant decrease in crime across the city. Among other tactics, Police Commissioner William J. Bratton poured in scores of officers specially trained to zero in on the two linchpins of street crime: drugs and guns. In a sharp break from past practice, officers were encouraged to tackle any crime they came across, rather than merely reporting it to a specialized unit. The initial results were quite encouraging: murders plunged by 31 percent in the first eight months of the year, and robberies were down significantly as well.

 BODY:

WEST QUEENS
 
Invasion of Hunters Point?
 
 It is the closest point in Queens to midtown Manhattan, and therein lies what many consider this neighborhood's promise and others its possible demise. In September, ground was broken on the Queens West project, which is to transform a 74-acre site along the East River in Hunters Point by adding a touch of Manhattan to this industrial and residential area: a 42-story apartment tower, a four-block hotel-and-office complex catering to the United Nations, myriad parks and plazas. 
 Residents grumbled that the project would overwhelm the already congested area. Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey criticized the Queens West board -- representing the state, the city's Economic Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- as outsiders with no knowledge of the borough. "The attitude has always been that the agencies coming in are like the old Christian missionaries bringing civilization to the Hottentots," he said.

MIDDLE QUEENS
 
Prison for Glendale Vandal
 
 For residents here, "DESA" represented, more than anything else, an attack on this civic-minded community's quality of life. The tag, or graffiti signature, belonged to Robert Morrissey, 19, who was sentenced to one to three years in prison for spray-painting a subway station, and who officials said was responsible for $1 million in damage. Members of several civic associations that have struggled against graffiti attended the court proceedings and the sentencing, one of the stiffest ever for graffiti, said District Attorney Richard A. Brown.

An Insurgent in Ridgewood
 
 A fear of outsiders here, and in the surrounding, predominantly white, blue-collar neighborhoods of southwest Queens, gave a push to Frank Borzellieri's campaign for the 38th Assembly District. The Republican's platform included eliminating foreign languages from government-issued documents and banning from schools books he found anti-American, like biographies of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The Democratic incumbent, Anthony S. Seminerio, said he began campaigning widely after Mr. Borzellieri surprised him by winning the Conservative Party's nomination in what became the most closely watched Assembly race in Queens. But Mr. Seminerio -- a staunch supporter of the death penalty who voted against an expansion of gay rights and who once introduced legislation proposing that Queens secede from New York City -- was no liberal himself. In the end, Mr. Borzellieri got only 35 percent of the vote.

Fears of Crime in Woodside
 
 To many supporters of Mr. Borzellieri, this neighborhood embodied all their fears. Geographically, Woodside is a buffer between the stable white communities to the west and southwest, and the bustling immigrant neighborhoods to the east. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway was once considered a psychological line separating Woodside from Jackson Heights's overcrowding, drugs, social clubs and prostitution, especially along Roosevelt Avenue. But these problems have spilled over into Woodside, and now residents point to a new boundary, the Long Island Rail Road station, which cuts Woodside into eastern and western halves. In October, three men robbed a club in the western section, and residents sought more protection. Police Commissioner William J. Bratton called it "a neighborhood in transition" and said, "We don't want to lose Woodside."
 
Zoning in Jackson Hts.
 
 In Jackson Heights and Corona, where tens of thousands of immigrants have settled in the last decade, tensions often grow between newcomers and old-timers. But recently, a two-year-old City Council law has illuminated an unusually disruptive problem: the unauthorized conversion of houses into businesses -- most often auto shops and bodegas -- on residential streets. It is a problem in areas with many recent immigrants from countries where setting up shop at home is common and does not require zoning changes and other permits. Immigrants from Central and South America make Corona and Jackson Heights stand out; nearly half of all businesses shut down under the new law in Queens were in Corona. Residents on streets with no commerce sometimes wake up to an altered streetscape -- an addition wedged between two row houses, a beauty parlor next door, deafening sound coming from a new welding shop.

Church vs. Elmhurst Elderly
 
 In this wildly ethnically diverse neighborhood, cultural conflicts can take strange twists. The long-running feud between the Christian Testimony Church and its tenant, the Elmhurst-Jackson Heights Senior Center, is proof of that. The fundamentalist Chinese church had long frowned on the senior center's dances and mah-jongg as scandalous. But the city-run center -- which has Chinese, Puerto Rican, Korean and Filipino members -- ignored the church, even though the lease prohibited dancing or gambling. With the lease expiring on Dec. 31, the church refused to negotiate a new lease unless both activities ceased. In November, the mah-jongg and dancing stopped, and about 40 Chinese women migrated to an Italian center for the elderly where mah-jongg offended no one.
 
Still Topless in Rego Park
 
 When Mayor Giuliani made his sweeping proposal in September to restrict sex-oriented business to relatively nonresidential areas, he was responding to a growing militance on the issue in places like Rego Park. That neighborhood's big fight came when Wiggles, an all-nude nightclub, opened last summer, just south of the Long Island Expressway. It became one of six adult-oriented businesses on a mile-long stretch of Queens Boulevard. For weeks, scores protested Wiggles every night. But the club remains.

Business Boom in Flushing
 
 Flushing continued to grow as one of the city's largest retail districts. The year-old Caldor's on Roosevelt Avenue became one of the highest-volume stores of the Caldor chain. And in early December, a 50,000-square-foot, $10 million food market called Korea Town Plaza opened, in a departure from Koreans' traditionally small businesses here.
The city also turned to infrastructure, repairing the damage caused by a decade of wild growth: it completed a $7.4 million resurfacing of Main Street, in downtown's most heavily traveled stretch. What's more, Mayor Giuliani pressed transit officials to restore $39 million for a renovation of the Flushing No. 7 subway station, even as restoration at 15 other stations was postponed.
The city also got a hint of the Korean and Chinese community's growing political clout. The Police Department had decided to move its Queens Robbery Squad and Asian Crime Investigation Team west to Long Island City. But Flushing's Asian communities, concerned about extortion and robberies by Asian gangs, protested the move. The Police Department yielded, and the units remain in Flushing.

SOUTHEAST QUEENS
 
Fire Worries in Jamaica
 
 More people die in fires here than anywhere else in the city. Also, wood-frame houses and aging wiring, especially in south Jamaica, combine to make this neighborhood No. 1 in Queens for commercial, residential and arson fires. So when the Fire Department announced in October that budget cuts would remove red fire-alarm boxes from sidewalks, the outcry here was louder than in other poor neighborhoods where many do not own phones. Removal of the boxes will start on Jan. 15.

Homeless in the Rockaways
 
 Ask oldtimers here to explain the Rockaways' decline, and they'll point fingers at the city, which they say built a disproportionate number of housing projects on the peninsula in the last four decades. Once a middle-class summer resort, the Rockaways now include some of the poorest and bleakest areas in Queens. So residents were outraged when the city Department of Homeless Services began placing single mothers in the Lawrence Hotel on Beach 116th Street in late August. The hotel, a longtime fixture on Rockaway Park's commercial spine, had housed the homeless for 11 years. But in 1993, a new law forbidding placement of families in rooms without kitchens emptied the Lawrence -- and neighbors believed that the disappearance of the homeless would help their street rebound economically.
The city returned the homeless because of an unexpected rise in people seeking shelter in late August but promised that they would leave after two months. Neighbors on Beach 116th Street took no chance, complaining and marching in front of the Lawrence, and the city kept its word.

Jamaica Bay Marsh Accord
 
 A bitter three-year battle between the only inhabited island in Jamaica Bay and the state Department of Environmental Conservation ended last fall. The agency had fined residents, sometimes thousands of dollars, for building decks, bulkheads and floats that protruded into the marshland. Residents said the structures protected their houses from tides and storms. In the end, both sides reached an agreement: residents can keep the structures and pay reduced fines, which will be used to transform an acre of city-owned land in the area into new wetlands.

NORTHEAST QUEENS
 
A Fresh Meadows Street
 
 Saul Weprin died last February, a much beloved political fixture of northeast Queens and a builder of consensus as Assembly Speaker in Albany. Councilman Morton Povman introduced a proposal to name 188th Street -- where Mr. Weprin lived for a quarter of a century and where he and his wife, Sylvia, raised three sons -- "Saul Weprin Boulevard." The proposal seemed headed for easy approval until opponents began arguing in December that changing the thoroughfare from a "street" to "boulevard" would create a four-lane highway with parking meters. The anonymous opponents began passing around fliers urging residents to attend a public hearing at which more than 100 loudly voiced their fears, to the dismay of Mr. Weprin's widow who also attended the meeting. Officials tried reassuring them that "boulevard" would not change the thoroughfare, except, of course, in name. But the residents didn't buy the explanations. And the proposal was put on hold.

Looking Back, Looking Ahead, Bronx

 BODY:

THE SOUTH BRONX
 
Up From the Fires
 
 Depopulated to the tune of 300,000 people in the 1970's, the South Bronx became a national symbol of urban degradation and the city's neediest ward. 
 But fed on its deathbed by a huge housing renovation program sponsored by a mayor remembered as a conservative -- Edward I. Koch -- the South Bronx is now being presented as a survivor with fresh-faced tenements and growing pockets of suburban-style housing. Nearly 20,000 apartments have been refurbished, more than 2,500 new houses have been built for working-class home buyers and 2,000 more are under construction.
The pace of the momentum is being closely watched by those concerned that the lack of density of the new developments will fail to support the retail establishments necessary for a real boom, and that the first-generation homeowners, of moderate means, may collapse under mortgage pressures. There is also fear that the fresh paint and new kitchens can provide no more than a mask for the underlying problems of bad schools, unmotivated youths, drugs, crime and the AIDS epidemic, which is creating ever-widening circles of despair in the South Bronx.

Politics as Unusual
 
 Some of the city's rawest and most interesting politics are being played out in the South Bronx as advocates battle over whether housing money should be used for the poor or those with moderate incomes. There is also the city's impending decision on whether to finance a new police academy, the major public works project in the Bronx Center Plan, a package of revitalization efforts in a 300-block area.
Out of the recent struggles in the South Bronx have risen several intriguing figures. Perhaps only an area so desperate could produce such an unconventional leader as Matthew Lee, a 29-year-old building superintendent who grew up in the Boston suburb of Brookline and is drawing wide attention for using the Federal Community Reinvestment Act to force banks to invest tens of millions of dollars in the Bronx.
There is also the poker game at Yankee Stadium, where George M. Steinbrenner 3d is threatening to leave. The Yankees left ill feelings when a team official was quoted as referring to youths who hang on the area's basketball rims as "monkeys." Another affront was a state proposal to build a bridge over the Harlem River. Under the proposal, fans would not have to set a tire on the streets of the Bronx.

Felipe's Family
 
 If he can keep life and limb, Felipe Lopez will soon be able to finance part of the South Bronx redevelopment. A hefty pro contract likely awaits the basketball star, who honed his skills at the legendary Gauchos Gym and decided last year to use his talents on behalf of the St. John's Red Storm.
 His success overshadowed a subtler story of the South Bronx, an area portrayed in undifferentiated form to the outside world. His family moved from Mott Haven to Melrose in 1993. The nine-block trek north brought great relief to the Lopez family. Their new apartment is in a working-class neighborhood, rough perhaps, but a step up from their nightmarish digs on 142d Street. Felipe recalled one incident: "At I.S. 139, they've got a playground. All I was doing was playing ball. But there were always people selling drugs and people standing around in line for them. One time, this guy came out with an Uzi and started shooting. The guy selling had a handgun. I was out of there. You never know when you'll be in the wrong place at the wrong time."

CO-OP CITY
 
Come One, Come All
 
 There was good news at Co-op City, the largest co-op housing project in the United States. It rebounded with a surge in newcomers, even as longtime residents complained that the surrounding area was being overdeveloped. In early 1993, deaths and retirement had left 1,500 empty units, an all-time high in the 15,372-unit, middle-income complex. That same year, the Co-op City board cut the price per room from $2,800 to $1,750, and in August 1994 it received a state grant of $3 million to attract buyers. The efforts appeared to have worked: by the end of November, vacancies were at their lowest in a decade, at 579 empty apartments.
When Co-op City was built in the late 1960's, many of its original residents had just fled the streets off the Grand Concourse in the South Bronx. Co-op City offered larger apartments, wider streets and easier living in the northeast Bronx. It is no surprise, then, that longtime residents have bitterly opposed commercial expansion in their area. In November, a giant Kmart opened in Bay Plaza, a retail and office development just south of Co-op City, and it has attracted thousands of shoppers and cars. Residents are now rallying against another developer who is eyeing city-owned land north of Co-op City.

KINGSBRIDGE/FORDHAM
 
The Once and Future Bronx
 
 In the last year, residents pondered, declaimed and fought over the uncertain future of three landmarks in the north central Bronx. Nothing really linked the three -- except the timing of the debates and, perhaps, their secure place in the Bronx's history and their unclear role in the future of a borough in transition.
Loew's Paradise, on the Grand Concourse at 187th Street in Fordham, may become a center for performing arts after showing movies for 65 years. A task force is in the middle of a $70,000 study of the prospects for the Paradise, which fell on hard times in this age of multiplex theaters . After it closed in early 1994, its new owners, A.B.I. Property Partners of Delaware, considered turning the ornate theater into a shopping center. Local officials continued to press the Landmarks Commission to protect the theater's interior.
Neighbors of the Jerome Park Reservoir pressed their fight against the city's plan to build a large water-filtration plant at the site. The city's Department of Environmental Protection has postponed a draft of an environmental impact statement until next year, and is looking at alternative sites in Westchester. The project was first proposed in 1990 when the Federal Government mandated that drinking water that is transported above ground through a system of lakes and reservoirs must be filtered. The project must be completed by the end of 1999 to comply with the mandate. Residents say the huge plant would destroy the surrounding area of playing fields and the campuses of three high schools and Lehman College.
The last of the National Guards left the Kingsbridge Armory in the fall as post-Cold War military cutbacks padlocked the 77-year-old building. The armory is in disrepair. And the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation continued its study on how best to use the site, as various groups, from the local schools to supporters of amateur athletics, voiced their desires. A nine-story, red-brick structure, with two great towers that emphasize its medieval-style exterior, the armory covers an entire block, and was designated a city landmark in 1974.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL;
Speed Demons in Disguise

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
"BUT officer, the school Christmas pageant starts in 10 minutes, and my daughter forgot her halo."
This excuse for going 45 in a 30-mile-an-hour zone is unlikely to make much headway if you are driving, say, a swoopy new Camaro. But it might work if you are behind the wheel of a Plymouth Voyager, with the built-in infant seat and Raffi tapes in the cassette player. But, then, hardly anyone would be tempted to speed in a mini-van. 
 What's needed here -- and just about any place where discretion is the better part of driving valor -- is something subversive in a plain brown wrapper. The kind of car that auto enthusiasts call a "sleeper."
The classic of the genre is surely the BMW 2002 of the 1970's, a tough sports sedan with as much visual pizazz as a Ford Falcon. In more recent years, car buffs were drawn to the dowdy but rip-snorting Nissan Sentra SE-R, which has been discontinued. But by accident or design, auto makers continue to build hot cars in tepid garb.
Few cars will turn fewer heads than the Acura Integra GS-R Sports Sedan , a generic-looking Japanese subcompact with an appearance distinguished only by its tiny, goofy-looking halogen headlights. But the innards of the GS-R are testimony to how much the Acura line benefits from the trickle-down of race car technology developed by Honda, the parent of Acura.
Turn the key and take measure of the slightly menacing buzz from an engine that produces 170 horsepower from four cylinders displacing a mere 1.8 liters. Slip into first, ease off the clutch and before you can say "wow" the engine is shrieking toward 8,000 revolutions a minute. But not to worry: this power plant is built to run faster than any production auto engine in the world.
And the gearbox, with short, precise throws into the five close-ratio speeds, requires almost no time to learn to use well.
Getting from zero to 60 in less than seven seconds in the GS-R is a kick; accelerating hard out of a curve is even better. The tight (but never unpleasantly stiff) suspension, oversized Michelin tires and variable power-assisted steering make this light sedan (2,765 pounds) feel even lighter. Front and rear disk brakes, with a standard anti-lock feature, are great confidence builders.
Quibbles? Sure. The front seats offer fine side support, but nothing in the lumbar (lower back) region for those of us who are only young at heart. The power steering is a touch too powerful. And the high-revving engine is annoyingly noisy for interstate cruising, even in fifth gear. But, hey, where else can you find so much road-friendly technology for so little money (about $21,000, including alloy wheels and a very nice radio) in so modest a package?
Try a Volkswagen showroom. VW has just repackaged a blast from its past, an econobox with the heart of a lion called the Golf GTI VR6 . Like the GTI of the 1970's, this one is a visual ringer for the plain, bottom-of-the-line model. But unlike the earlier GTI, this coupe has a dazzling, 172-horsepower engine and a sophisticated suspension.
While the statistics on the GTI's acceleration and cornering -- not to mention the sticker price -- are in the same ball park as those for the Integra GS-R, the personalities of the cars could hardly be more different. The Acura is as austere on the inside as a school bus; the cloth seats in the VW flaunt a brightly colored abstract design. And while the Acura's suspension and steering do everything with utter predictability, the VW has a mind of its own: at full throttle in first and second, the GTI wanders a bit before heading in the assigned direction.
Once pointed in a straight line, though, the VW is the better cruiser. The seats are exceptionally comfortable, with plenty of support all round. And while the GTI is no Mercedes in noise suppression, the drone of the V6 is soothing at highway speeds.
Some drivers will no doubt be put off by the fact that the headlights are always lit when the car is moving, a safety feature that seems likely to make its way soon onto all new cars. But the GTI's only unpardonable sin is the paucity of interior storage: a passenger-side air bag displaces what might have been the glove box.
Sleepers don't all come in small packages. Consider the Ford Taurus SHO , a sensible front-drive sedan transformed into a hot rod for the 40-something set.
The SHO, which first appeared in 1988, is a triumph of engineering over bean counting. Ford replaced the Taurus's boring, home-grown V6 with a more powerful (220 horsepower) V6 made by Yamaha. Then it modified the suspension, tuned the steering for more road feel, added beefier tires and replaced the front seats with perhaps the most supportive and comfortable buckets available on any car.
The 1995 SHO (the last model year for this SHO, and for that matter, this Taurus) that I tested, like two-thirds of those sold, came with a responsive 3.2-liter engine and a four-speed automatic. The automatic adds at least a second to the 0-60 acceleration time and the extra weight is noticeable in cornering. Still, it fits well in a car that is likely to spend an hour in commuter traffic for every minute on open winding roads.
Apart from stealth, versatility is the key to the SHO's allure. When nothing much is asked of it, the car acts like just another near-luxury sedan with dual air bags, anti-lock brakes and room for five. But when the pedal hits the metal, it delivers the punch and the handling you might expect from a Nissan Maxima, along with a muted growl reminiscent of the big Infiniti Q45.
The SHO is hardly perfect. The Taurus's ubiquitous jelly-bean shape has been tarted up with a vestigial rear spoiler. The leather seats are a bit slippery. And the price (about $26,000, loaded) could be a deal-breaker. Still it is a kick to drive a car this good that won't draw a second glance from your stick-in-the-mud boss -- or from Officer Smokey.
INSIDE TRACK: For great engineering, go with the Acura. Those who like to walk on the soft side will love the SHO. For sheer fun, hardly anything beats the GTI.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Looking for the Enemy;
For C.I.A., History Is the Big Traitor

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The failure of R. James Woolsey Jr. as chief of American intelligence was a political horror movie: Return of the Vision Thing.
 After the dust cleared from Operation Desert Storm back in 1991, President George Bush, who had run the Central Intelligence Agency himself not so long before, could not articulate where he wanted to take the United States. And with victory in the cold war secured, Mr. Woolsey had no vaulting vision of where to take the C.I.A., whose sense of mission has wandered off the map and whose morale is lower than Death Valley. 
 Awful as it was, the story of Aldrich Ames, the mole for Moscow, was only part of Mr. Woolsey's problems. A bigger problem was that Mr. Woolsey, a lawyer by temperament and training, wound up becoming the combative advocate for the C.I.A. in the court of public opinion. And in these fast-changing times, the C.I.A. has been a difficult client.
 When the enemy lived in Moscow and his agents were everywhere, the C.I.A.'s tasks were clear. Now the enemy lives in places few Americans can pronounce. With a tip of the hat to James Bond, we will call him Dr. No. He might be in Tajikistan, a former Soviet republic, with 1,000 acres of opium poppies under cultivation, 2,000 loyal gunmen from Afghanistan, $1 million in a Swiss bank and a firm offer for another million from Iran in exchange for a small tactical nuclear weapon under lock and key outside Dushanbe.

 
 
Out of Their Element
 These are not problems for subtle, secret statecraft. This is not spy-versus-spy stuff. This is law enforcement, a task for which spies are ill-suited. A cop confronted with an evildoer wants to string him up. A spook wants to string him along. The C.I.A. can do this kind of work only in liaison with intelligence services it has either worked against or tried to ignore, like the Russian agency that succeeded the K.G.B., as well as America's own Federal Bureau of Investigation.
 Those liaisons exist, but the links are still weak. If it wants bragging rights as the world's greatest intelligence service, the C.I.A. must bust Dr. No -- and then tell the world about it.
 All year long, Mr. Ames himself and Mr. Woolsey struggled like Professor Moriarty and Sherlock Holmes, grappling in mortal combat to influence public understanding of the meaning of the Ames case. People in Washington believed the traitor when he said that spying had decayed into a pointless sideshow; they cocked an eyebrow when Mr. Woolsey argued that it was still a sword and shield for the United States. That Mr. Woolsey was more right than wrong mattered little.
 Five years after the end of the Communist threat that drove American foreign policy after World War II, no one has set the course for the secret agencies of the United States. That job properly belongs to the White House and the National Security Council. If they can't do it, the Director of Central Intelligence must. A hundred top-secret papers on the subject, offering various suggestions and written by graduates of the old school, lie moldering in classified vaults. No one has done the job. No articulate vision exists.
 What can the C.I.A. do that the Rand Corporation, Lockheed, Army commandos and the Brookings Institution cannot? Plenty, in theory: a C.I.A. officer abroad has freedom and power to carry out foreign policy through behind-the-scenes contacts when open diplomacy fails. But he needs the confidence of the White House and the State Department, and that has been lacking.
 The Director of Central Intelligence spends $75 million a day on an empire largely controlled by the Pentagon's military agencies, which have fantastically expensive machines that steal words and images from the ether -- taking pictures from satellites and eavesdropping on the world's telecommunications.

 
 
So Much to Rethink
 But the C.I.A. remains central, the sun in the secret solar system. Its analysts write papers on every topic under heaven. Its operators, the people who work overseas stealing secrets, spend their days trying to suborn the second secretary of some third world embassy. An extraordinary few save lives by telling lies.
 Reforming the agency would require rethinking a lot of roles. Seven thousand analysts focus on a thousand subjects; too often, the results are those of a second-rate think tank. Morgan Guaranty knows more about the Mexican peso than the C.I.A.; the bank has better informants, and its analysts make better money.
 Focusing on "open sources," meaning those that aren't secret, is self-defeating; newspapers, CNN and The Economist do that fairly well. Unless the analysts concentrate on what's truly secret, they will be a good-enough-for government-work research institute, which is to say second-rate. Today, a scholarly hacker can get more information about Russia in a day than the C.I.A. collected in its first 20 years. Most of what the C.I.A. had to steal from its old enemy is now free or for sale.
 That means the covert operators have to steal real secrets. The spies say they have been defamed as a drunken and debilitated boys' club, that they are perfectly capable of policing themselves and that they have an important role to play in a world without an Evil Empire. Whether they have sufficient talent to play that role is an open question.
 Some threats the C.I.A. can do nothing about: ecological, environmental and economic catastrophes. It can -- and sometimes does -- stop weapons smuggling and terrorism by rogue states and tribes with flags. Its highest calling in years to come may be as a global cop forcing people to check their weapons at the door of Western civilization.
 The Ames case was the endgame of the old secret war. The collapse of the Russian enemy, ironically, insured the old C.I.A.'s decay. That a slacker like Mr. Ames could flourish in the clandestine service destroyed what reputation the old school had left.
 So a vision for the secret agencies now depends on figuring out what really threatens national security apart from second-rate schools and cheap handguns and social entropy, how much of the threat is susceptible to spying -- and how willing American spies might be to learn strange tongues and improvise new roles.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Epic Political Realignments Often Aren't

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Newt Gingrich and the Republicans arrive at the Capitol this week for the opening salvo of a rightward revolution they say will bring about the biggest transformation in American politics since the New Deal. Next target: the White House.
 To hear it from many Republicans, there will be no turning back. 
 "Ronald Reagan has been re-elected, not once but hundreds of times," Edwin J. Feulner Jr., president of the Heritage Foundation, declared in his 1995 "state of conservatism message." Each year, Mr. Feulner delivers such a message, but this year there was a note of glee in it: "American voters sent to Washington and the statehouses and legislatures of America an army of soliders who will fight to finish the revolution President Reagan began."
 Such expectations among Republicans are reminiscent of the hype that accompanied the Democratic sweep of Congress in 1974, after Watergate, and Jimmy Carter's election in 1976. Republicans were so dejected those days that Ronald Reagan and other conservatives went as far as to propose changing the name of the party to the "New Republican Party." And former Gov. Tom McCall of Oregon said his party had "made so many fatal mistakes it finds itself an endangered species at its own graveside."

 
 
Staving Off Extinction
 Just four years later, with the victory of Ronald Reagan and the Republican takeover of the Senate, some joyous Republicans with short memories proclaimed that Democrats were on the verge of extinction.
 Each recent election has led the victors to predict that their party had so captivated the electorate that it would lead to a realignment, with one party and its ideas dominating the branches of government and political dialogue for years to come. But the forces that move people and sway elections are always easier to understand years later than while they are unfolding.
 The current realignment talk seems to flourish not because there is a new yearning for Republican philosophies in the electorate but because people are yearning for change. Even though the nation is not at war and the statistics point to a vibrant economy, people perceive a crisis. The world is unsettled, and many people do not feel financially secure.
 As a result, Americans, increasingly impatient with their leaders and eager for solutions to pressing national problems, are inclined to invest more hope in what elections will bring about than may be realistic. They long for fundamental changes that may only be carried out by a years-long shift in party dominance.
 "It's not so much that realignments fall apart as that they are too eagerly anticipated," said Richard G. Niemi, a political scientist at the University of Rochester and expert on voting behavior. "We always tend to react to what's new in politics, to what's changed, because none of us is completely satisfied with the way things are."
 Martin J. Wattenberg, a political science professor at the University of California at Irvine and an authority on the decline of the parties, said the apparent seismic shifts in the recent midterm elections may prove illusory. "These realignments have happened every 30 or 40 years throughout American history," he said. "What people don't seem to appreciate is it's just not likely to happen again. The new political order is different. This is not going to be a partisan realignment because people don't have strong party loyalties anymore."
 As much as Speaker-to-be Gingrich talks of revolution, fundamental changes in American political history have always been more evolutionary than revolutionary. The most significant realignment of this century -- of the same magnitude as the rise of the Republicans with the elections of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 and William McKinley in 1896 -- was the Democratic triumph in 1932 with the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
 The argument of Republicans like Mr. Feulner is that the November elections marked the true finale of the New Deal era, an event that could lead to Republican dominance in Congress and the White House for years. "We've finally reached the end of the New Deal," said Harvey C. Mansfield, a professor of government at Harvard University. "This is the completion of what Ronald Reagan began."
 Mr. Mansfield may be perceptive. Or he may be premature. There is no question that the 1994 election was historic; there are legitimate reasons why it could lead to a full-fledged political transformation. The fact that not one Republican incumbent was defeated for national office or for governor suggests sharp dissatisfaction with Democrats. In the South, Republicans added greatly to their strength in Congress and state legislatures and are poised to add to their spoils. And while realignments usually come about with a strong leader at the top of the ticket, the fact that Republicans did so well in an off-year election may prove that something bigger was stirring in the electorate.

 
 
Eras Come and Go
 But what stirs the electorate can change quickly and unpredictably. Pundits and pollsters would do well to remember that Gerald Ford lost the White House in 1976 in part because he pardoned his predecessor, and that the luckless Jimmy Carter lost in 1980 not just because he faced discontent (and a telegenic opponent) at home but because a band of revolutionaries thousands of miles away were holding Americans hostage. For that matter, Harris Wofford embraced the health care issue to win election to the Senate from Pennsylvania in 1991. Three years later, Mr. Wofford was turned out, and many Democrats were undone by that issue.
 Kevin Phillips, a Republican analyst, said Republicans claiming a realignment are overreaching. "You could get a circumstance where in 1995 and 1996 you've got a Republican Congress squabbling with the Democratic White House and the heads of both of them, Gingrich and Clinton, have lousy ratings," he said. "That would set the scene for something that hasn't happened before: a simultaneous disenchantment." Rather than a generational dominance of one party, Mr. Phillips said, "I can see a real battle for the House from now on. I think it will be very serious in 1996."
 Some analysts argue that a more likely scenario is not a realignment to the Republican or Democratic parties but movement to a third party. Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, Mr. Clinton's most successful rival in the 1992 Democratic Presidential primaries, is the latest political figure to seek a third-party candidate in 1996. "It's more likely that people will look back 50 years from now," Mr. Wattenberg said, "and say this was the beginning of a real serious movement for a moderate third party."
 But predicting realignments or political shifts is as unreliable as conducting an opinion poll three weeks before the election. Every recent election has seemed to spawn a political era that never came to be. Only two years ago, the election of Bill Clinton was portrayed as the end of any remnant of Reaganism and the ascendancy of Democrats. Only three years ago, in the afterglow of the Persian Gulf War, President Bush was on top in the polls and a Democrat in the White House was unthinkable. The cycle has come full circle: now, the prospects for a Democrat in the White House after 1996 seems unthinkable to many people.
 Republicans are determined not to squander the opportunity. But it takes more than a politically skilled Speaker or President to insure a party's continued dominance. So what will historians 50 years from now write about the Nov. 8 election?
 "Certainly, not a chapter," said Ross K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University. "Somewhere between a paragraph and a page. It will show a kind of broadening of a Republican beachhead."
 Mr. Gingrich believes the beachhead will become a permanent base, worthy of a book or even several. Clearly, he was thinking in epic terms when he decided to call his next volume: "To Renew America."

HEADLINE: The World: Auld Lang Syne;
A Toast! To the Good Things About Bad Times

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
In Soviet times, the real living room was in the kitchen, a cramped, dingy space where friends laughed, drank, smoked, sang, quarreled and talked intensely into the night, night after night. Back in the days when nothing was permitted, only relationships could really flourish. Russians cultivated those friendships with fierce attention, focusing their ample free time and creative energy on the never-ending conversation in the kitchen.
 Now the conversation has petered out. 
 For educated Russians, Communism's collapse brought freedom, uncertainty, opportunity and risk. For some, it brought high-powered careers, travel and money. It also took something from the nature of Russian friendship. And that has left many Russians with a hollow feeling at New Year's, once the occasion for celebrating friendship. Now, as the resurrection of Christmas steals some of the glow from the New Year holiday, the turn of the year has become a bittersweet occasion for burrowing deep into nostalgia for what was good about the bad old days.
 "So often I used to have dozens of people squeezed around a table in a kitchen the size of a closet," said Olga Kravchenko, a former school teacher who has begun a new life as an office manager for an American company. "And now I have a big modern kitchen but I don't have the time or the energy to invite friends to dinner."
 These are nostalgic times, and not only in Russia. Reborn nationalist movements in Europe and elsewhere celebrate some of the darkest moments of recent history, giving sinister new meaning to "Auld Lang Syne." Triumphant American conservatism often ignores the underside of the 1950's as it looks back for models of the future.
 In Russia right now, the privations of the past are sometimes overlooked in the longing for friendships eaten away by new forces -- long hours, demanding careers, busy social lives and, most of all, money.
 In Soviet times, work was low on most people's list of priorities. For factory or office workers, the massive inefficiencies of central planning meant that steel or concrete or paper were only sporadically available, so work was sporadic. For the intelligentsia, work could also be slowed and distorted by the byzantine whims of the Communist Party bureaucracy.
 There was no shame to poverty when only criminals and party officials were rich. Obscurity was noble when professional achievement was bound up with political compromise.
Dedication to one's friends offered far more rewards. So it became customary to put the demands of friendship -- the queuing to treat friends to scarce delicacies, the journeys through the bureaucracy to help get their children into a good camp -- ahead of the demands of a job. "Better to have one hundred friends than one hundred rubles" was an oft-quoted axiom.
 Now, when 100 rubles won't buy a subway token, time and money play a different role. Obsessive work habits are pervasive, soaking up time once lavished on friendship. And now even close friends are estranged by disparities in salary level and social status, the restaurants they can afford, even the toys they buy their children.

 
 
A Party for the Past
 On a recent Friday night in a downtown Moscow office building, in a vast reception room filled with shiny black lacquer furniture, some of it still in its plastic wrapping, a large circle of friends -- actors, former dissidents, poets, teachers, engineers, folk singers, gathered to relive old times. They did so at the behest of Sergei V. Korniyko, 35, a new millionaire, who watched from the back of the room, wearing a smile and a beeper -- a genial, unenigmatic Gatsby.
 Mr. Korniyko spent much of the evening in the next office, seated at a giant circular black desk, his two bodyguards seated on a couch watching television. Occasionally, he wandered in and smiled fondly at the shabbily dressed men and women talking and strumming guitars wreathed in cigarette smoke. "Back then I was nobody, just a fan among millions," he said of the days when he was a low-level defense engineer. Gesturing at the tableau of the Russian intelligensia, some famous, most not, he added, "These people were my gods."
 He explained that he wasn't giving these evenings merely for his own entertainment or ego. "I'm not holding a personal concert for myself," he said. "These talented people gave so much in the old days. They need a big space where they can get together again, and sing and just talk."
 Not quite. "We go for the free food," said Irina Mikhelova, a translator for an American broadcasting company in Moscow who insisted there could be no comparison between Mr. Korniyko's salon and the kitchen parties of the past. "The food is better, the champagne is French, but we don't really feel warm," she said. "It's not the same. It just doesn't work."
 Ms. Mikhelova said she had no sentimental attachment to the past. She said she found the 1960's nostalgia concerts she used to attend irritating.
 "I don't have time for that now, and I'm glad," she said. "Now we can go to an office, do real work or go to Cyprus -- our lives are so much more interesting than before." She too spent long, vodka-soaked evenings around a table, leisurely dissecting love and life. "Then, the kitchen was our hiding place, our only permitted pleasure," she said, adding with a harsh laugh, "How many years did we waste in that damn kitchen!"
 For Westerners fleeing their own workaholic world, the Russian kitchen had its own exotic allure. More than the Hermitage museum or the Kremlin, it was that cramped, overheated room, with its fellowship and capitivating talk, that drew many Westerners to Russia.
 "Life in Russia then was meager, but it had a different richness," said Ellen Solowey, who lives in Moscow now and has been visiting Russia since 1979. "You can't transfer that kind of hospitality back to the States. You were Western, so people wanted to know you. Even if you were nobody special at home, you were special here."
 That too, has waned. "I have fewer Russian friends now," she said. "The novelty of Westerners has worn off, and people are busy. They're hustling."
 Now there are Russians with exciting careers who say they sometimes miss the freedom of a routine, undemanding job.
 "On one hand it was a kind of slavery," Denis Yevstigneyev, a 33-year-old film director, said about the Soviet era, "but in another way it was very beautiful and comfortable." As he recalled the long, meandering discussions around the kitchen table, he was seated alone at a long table in his gleaming modern kitchen in an elegantly renovated apartment in central Moscow. He did have not a lot of time to talk. He was getting ready to fly to Paris.
 Mr. Yevstigneyev recently released a successful film entitled "Limita," a bleak tale of post-Communist alienation that explores the toll on friendship brought by sudden wealth. The movie is set in the harsh, sootily glamorous new Russian business world.
 He said that in his own life, money had riven him from old friends. "I can't say our relationship ended," he said. "I simply can't meet with some people. I don't have enough money to go to their restaurants. We go to different resorts, live in different hotels. There is a kind of physical separation. We don't run into each other."
 It was in the hope of breaching that gap that Sergei Makharov, a pianist's son who had emigrated to Paris and became an overnight millionaire doing deals on the Russian sugar market, contacted his old, friend, Denis Yevstigneyev. A young man with a grandiose life style, Mr. Makharov offered to finance his friend's film, and together they started a studio and conceived of "Limita."
 The protagonist, a computer hacker who becomes rich by helping mobsters rob banks, tries to cure his anomie by reconnecting with his former best friend. But when the good-natured, hapless friend is murdered by the hero's mobster associates, the film ends tragically.
 So did the actual making of the film. Sergei Makharov was found murdered in his apartment in November in what the police described as a probable mafia hit.
 Getting ready to fly to Paris to attend Makharov's funeral, Mr. Yevstigneyev explained, without irony, that the show must go on. Life at the top in Russia, he suggested, was lonely. "People are now dependent only on themselves," he said, "and that is the great burden of our time."

HEADLINE: The World;
In Europe, Touches of Leanness and Meanness

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: BONN

 BODY:
One of the joys of the holiday season for Western European salaried employees is something the Germans call "Christmas money" -- usually a whole 13th month's salary, sometimes less. Like most of the social-welfare benefits introduced to help get Europe out of its post-World War II miseries, the bonus is now taken for granted.
 You didn't get a 13th month's salary this year? You probably didn't get the 39 paid holidays and vacation days that Germans get, either. Even a first-year employee here gets four to five weeks' paid vacation, 20 to 25 days, often with "vacation money" thrown in. 
 Working between Christmas and New Year's is almost unheard of; then there is about a week of unofficial goofing off around Mardi Gras in late winter. There are so many religious and state holidays in May that most people think of it as an extra summer vacation month.
 Yet doing away with just one of the 11 legal holidays -- the day of prayer and repentance in November -- stirred such strong opposition among German workers that it almost scuttled the Government's plan to introduce a new system of social insurance to pay for long-term old-age care.

 
 
Ex-Communist Competitors
 The uproar was a reflection of a gradual and painful economic revolution under way not only in Germany but throughout Western Europe. The Iron Curtain once shielded these well-off, socially beneficent states from the continent's poor (while the United States helped shoulder their defense burden), but the end of the cold war has given rise to keen competition from the formerly Communist countries to the east.
 Just across the Bavarian border in the Czech Republic, wage costs are only a tenth of what they are in Germany, though the workers there are nearly as well qualified. And over the last few years, hundreds of German companies, small and large, have rushed to move their assembly lines eastward.
 Restoring competitiveness is on every politician's lips in Europe these days, and for good reason, employers say. If German workers had time off only as often as Americans, who have an average total of 23 vacation days and holidays a year, Germany's gross national product would be approximately $100 billion bigger, according to the Institute for the German Economy in Cologne, an employers' group.
 "If Germans would stop laying down their tools at 11 A.M. every Friday, we could create 500,000 new jobs in the next two years," said Klaus Murmann, the head of the German Employers' Association. Factories, he said, ought to be allowed to run on Saturdays if they have enough orders to fill, with the few workers called in for extra shifts given extra time off in the days following.
 With nearly 3.5 million Germans out of work, you would think Mr. Murmann's proposal would be welcomed. Instead, union leaders called him a modern-day Scrooge.
 Some people think Germans have forgotten what hard work is. Even when they are working, they work fewer hours -- 1,639 a year, compared with 1,904 for Americans and 1,888 for Japanese. And German workers make more money than Americans -- an average of $14.93 per hour last year, compared with $12.39 for Americans. Danes, Swiss and Norwegians make even more.
 Even the poorest countries of the European Union -- Italy, Spain and Portugal -- have the comprehensive systems of state-mandated health insurance and generous welfare and unemployment benefits, financed by heavy taxation that Americans keep rejecting as too onerous.
 The difference is that highly taxed middle-class Europeans believe they get something for their tax money -- first-rate public transport, such excellent public schools that private ones are practically nonexistent, universal health care and government-administered social security pensions that they can live on.
 But Europe is afraid that it is slowly pricing itself out of world markets. German workers are now among the world's most expensive to employ.
 When employers' contributions to social security, worker's compensation, vacation pay and other fringe benefits mandated by the Government or labor union contracts are added to wages, they cost their companies $27.18 an hour in 1993, half again as much as Americans, which is one reason why BMW started manufacturing cars in South Carolina last year.
 And even though European economies began a strong recovery from the 1992-93 recession and are expected next year to keep growing nearly at the 3.1 percent rate projected for the United States, growth is not expected to have much effect on unemployment. At least 18 million Western Europeans are out of work, and many of them have been jobless for years.
 European companies, like American ones, have been shedding jobs to cut costs and make themselves more competitive, and they are unlikely to take on new hires unless laws change to reduce the burden of social costs.

 
 
Keeping Up
 Americans have been undergoing this painful process for more than a decade, during which average income for most middle-class families has shrunk. Europeans are still used to annual raises that keep them ahead of inflation. When governments in Italy and Belgium did away with automatic indexing, or tried to in Belgium last year, the biggest strikes in years ensued.
 German workers agreed to wage settlements below the rate of inflation in the past year, but only reluctantly. The major manufacturing unions have announced that this year, with production booming and inflation expected to be only around 2.5 percent, they will go into negotiations demanding raises of 6 percent.
 The unions had already agreed to sacrifice a paid holiday to get the plan for old-age care enacted. German industry insisted that it could never become competitive on world markets unless it got compensation for its contribution to the cost of this new social benefit -- 0.5 percent of every employee's salary this year, 0.85 percent next year, with workers paying a matching amount. To give companies an extra day of production and profits, one holiday was eliminated in every German state except Saxony, where workers will pay the whole contribution themselves.

 
 
Less for All
 At a summit meeting in Essen last month, 12 European Union leaders agreed that all needed to reduce unemployment benefits to the point where it pays to look for work, to encourage employers to hire part-time workers and to try to insure that wage settlements stay below the rate of inflation.
 This is much like what Americans have put themselves through. European workers, who naturally don't want their standard of living to decline, are already complaining of erosion.
 Helena Bohne, an employee in a clothing store in Bonn, makes a little over $550 a week and sees only $360 of it after taxes, mandatory health and old-age pension insurance and state-collected church tax are taken out. By the time she pays her rent and her utilities, she said, she has $200 a week left.
 "I have to worry about the new deduction for old-age-care insurance and a 7.5 percent 'solidarity' surcharge on income tax to pay for unification with East Germany," she said. "I don't expect much of a raise in the next year, because business in the retail sales industry has been terrible. But our government seems to believe that the people at the bottom of the scale should bear the entire burden."

HEADLINE: THE NEW GOVERNOR: THE PEOPLE;
New Year and New Governor Create New Hopes

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
The arrival of a new year and a new government is starting to tickle New Yorkers. Maybe it's chemical, like a low-grade spring fever. But the change of seasons in Albany seems to be stirring among many a feeling not unlike hope.
"You have to be optimistic," said Joseph Mechanick, 48, a plumber who lives with his mother and son in Flushing. "You get so depressed being anything else that you've got to hope." 
 The problem is, so many people are hoping for so many things. The list reads like a letter to Santa, jam-packed with everything from painless commuting and snow-free sidewalks to reinvented government.
Their expectations may become the burden of George E. Pataki, who takes office today after campaigning for Governor so effectively on the splendidly nebulous promise of change.
For many, the hopes touch directly or indirectly on their own lives and work. Clement Salama, a computer programmer from Crown Heights, wants faster, cleaner subways. Rocco Landesman, the theater operator and producer, wants Broadway to flourish. Robert Fenton, a retired purchasing agent from Williamsville, outside snowy Buffalo, wouldn't mind if someone on welfare shoveled his sidewalk.
Floyd Maines would like a better business climate for his giant food distribution company in Conklin. Ann Roberts, a pattern-maker from Flatbush, wants better housing and less crime. Larry Rockefeller, an environmental lawyer and a fourth generation heir to the Standard Oil fortune, wants laws more efficiently and effectively applied.
In interviews in recent days, New Yorkers largely expressed optimism about the new administration, even some who voted for Mario M. Cuomo. Some seemed to look to Mr. Pataki to restore their faith in the future, to make New York a place where their children and grandchildren could thrive, a place where lives have continuity -- the Empire State again.
At the same time, many said they would welcome a revolution in state government -- an enlightened re-examination of the role of the public sector, then a sloughing off of obsolete functions toward a leaner, more vital operation.
"They expect a governor who is a larger-than-life figure," said Gerald Benjamin, director of the Center for New York State and Local Government Studies in Albany. "This is a little dangerous because the expectation/disappointment cycle sets in too fast."
Some insist the time is ripe for change in New York. They say the political planets are propitiously aligned -- with a new Governor and an almost-new Mayor of New York City, both Republicans, in the one year in every four in which neither they nor the New York State Legislature is up for re-election.
It's the year that Peter Goldmark, the former New York State budget director and current president of the Rockefeller Foundation, calls "the year of heavy lifting," that phase in the four-year cycle when politicians grit their teeth and "know there is some heavy water to be carried."
Adding to the challenge, he and others said, is a sense of crisis. All three levels of government -- Federal, state and local -- are under heavy fiscal pressures. The economy, at least in theory, is already in a recovery, so there is little promise of a dramatic upturn in tax receipts to bail government out.
"It is very likely that in 1995 we are going to see people who got a tax cut at the same time they got laid off from a state or city job," said Mr. Goldmark. "Clearly, things are out of whack when that happens. I use that to underline the perversity of the intersection of political and fiscal forces."
Yet in that challenge, many said, lies opportunity.
"It's a moment in time when you can look anew at the way you were doing things," said Professor Benjamin, who also teaches political science at the State University of New York at New Paltz. "That doesn't mean that every alternative is smart. It simply means that windows of opportunity open."
New Yorkers are divided on how the state will fare.
Dr. Manuel Alvarez, 38, the director of obstetrics at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, is feeling optimistic: "Change, in whatever form, is good. People run out of ideas and it's always good to bring in a new crew."
But Tom Stoddard, 46, a New York City lawyer active in gay issues, described his mood as profoundly sad: "Change is not invariably good. This change is certainly not good. It's a sign of distress without solution."
As for their own lives, many seemed to be hoping for improvement.
Floyd Maines, 74, a business owner, said he hoped Mr. Pataki would lower his costs. Feeling oppressed by high taxes, utility rates and workmen's compensation fees, Mr. Maines said he could save $1.5 million immediately if he were willing to move his company, Maines Paper and Food Service, to Pennsylvania.
But the company has been in New York for 75 years. It has grown from a candy business started by Mr. Maines's father into a vast enterprise selling food and supplies to 5,000 customers in 18 states. "It's a family business," said Mr. Maines, whose sons now run the company. "You hate to give up your roots."
Mary and Ray Clapper expect tax relief, too. They own and operate Muffin Mary's Restaurant near the City Hall in Syracuse. They opened the business several years ago, after Mr. Clapper's employer went bankrupt. At age 61, they said they work 75 to 80 hours a week. They can't afford part-time help.
The Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, the president of Fordham University, wants strong state support for higher education. Reading the transition tea leaves, he is feeling encouraged. Charles Ohebshalom, an exporter from Great Neck, L.I., believes crime will indeed drop should Mr. Pataki succeed in reinstating the death penalty.
Even Esther Murphy, 70, a retired insurance-company supervisor from Flushing who voted against Mr. Pataki, is entertaining the possibility that things might get better: "I still have a little hope. We have to give him a chance. Because he's in and we're stuck with him."
Not everyone, of course, managed to muster enthusiasm.
Frank J. Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy Institute in Albany, which does research on state and local finances, said Mr. Pataki's plan to cut income tax rates could end up hurting the very people to whom the idea most appealed.
Mr. Mauro said his group had watched New York State's top income tax rate drop from 15.38 percent in 1975 to 7.88 percent this year. At the same time, he said, more than half the state's counties raised their sales tax at least once, and property tax revenues rose twice as fast as income tax revenues.
Because the income tax is a more progressive tax in that it burdens the wealthy more, Mr. Mauro said the tax structure had become less fair. To continue cutting the income tax, as Mr. Pataki has promised, will worsen the inequity and put even greater pressure on local governments to either cut services or raise their taxes, he said.
"The rural counties have the most at risk from his plan," said Mr. Mauro, because income tax receipts come primarily from high-income areas like New York City and its suburbs, while rural areas receive the most, on a per capita basis, from state aid financed by income taxes.
Ester Fuchs, director of the Barnard-Columbia Center for Leadership in Urban Policy, suggested that Mr. Pataki's agenda would do little to solve New York's ills: "I might have some more money in my pocket, but I will find the quality of my public life deteriorating."
Khalid Abdul Qudus, 24, a security guard from Washington Heights, called some of Mr. Pataki's views "barbaric." He said minority groups, in particular, would suffer. Of the new administration, he said: "They're going to ruin the cities and there's going to be a lot of violence."
At least a few people doubted that anything would change.
"How can you take something so bad and make it better?" asked Anthony Smith, 35, of Harlem, a father of two who was laid off a year ago from his job as an overnight courier. One morning recently, he had managed to land a day's work handing out flyers on a Brooklyn street for $3 an hour.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin's War: A Troubled Presidency Stained Indelibly

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 31

 BODY:
As Russian troops enter the bombed-out center of Grozny, the capital of the breakaway Chechen republic, this has inescapably become Boris Yeltsin's war. It has gravely stained his presidency and damaged his reputation, and with elections scheduled 18 months from now, he is increasingly seen as a lame duck.
If Mr. Yeltsin's nose operation on the eve of the invasion, Dec. 10, was an effort to hide from direct responsibility for Chechnya -- or, as some liberal democrats here suggest, without any evidence, the Russian President was pushed into war unwittingly -- he has identified himself with it now. And it is not too soon to look at the likely aftermath. 
 While only 63, Mr. Yeltsin is hardly in the pink of health, and has had an excruciatingly difficult three years. Russia's painful, lurching transition to a semi-democracy and semi-market economy have ground Mr. Yeltsin down, eroded his popularity and stained his aura of political righteousness.
It was always a question whether he would run for a second four-year term in June 1996, or whether he was simply going through the motions, to forestall a precipitate scramble for succession.
As the former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson once said, "A week is a long time in politics." But there is a growing judgment that now, after Chechnya, Mr. Yeltsin will not run or, if he does, he will not win. Many politicians and diplomats now fear that he may cancel the elections altogether.
"Yeltsin has no political future," said Sergei N. Yushenkov, the chairman of Parliament's defense committee, a member of the liberal Russia's Choice party and an opponent of the Chechnya war. "Even if the situation improves in Chechnya, the most he can expect is a decent departure from political life."
Many Russians are grateful for the astounding changes and opportunities the last three years have brought, since the Soviet Union collapsed at the end of 1991 and prices were liberalized a week later. But Russian voters are no more grateful than American ones, and many Russians have also had a wrenching three years that have left them poorer, less secure and more anxious than even at the end of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's rule.
Mr. Yeltsin may have survived the moral stigma, however necessary it might have been, of shelling the former Russian Parliament building to defeat a revolt against him in October 1993, an act supported by Westernized reformers and liberal democrats like the former Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar.
But Chechnya, and the use of the military to crush Russian citizens, is a shame that is sure to linger. The Chechen campaign has already been too disorganized, messy and bloody to please many conservatives, who are appalled by the condition of the army. And it has alienated those same reformist politicians, like Mr. Gaidar and the economist Grigori A. Yavlinsky, who fear that the financial burden of the war and the political cadre prosecuting it may spell the end of economic and political liberalization. They fear new restrictions on the press, on dissent and even the cancellation of the elections themselves.
They see Mr. Yeltsin, like Mr. Gorbachev before him toward the end of the Soviet Union, as a captive of the Kremlin, manipulated by the military and the secret police, given, as Mr. Gaidar has said, a false view of Russian public opinion.
Georgi A. Satarov, a liberal-minded Yeltsin aide, defends his boss.
"There is a circle of people Yeltsin meets with, and it's quite wide," Mr. Satarov said in an interview. "It's a myth that he's driven into a corner."
But when asked, Mr. Satarov said the last time Mr. Yeltsin met with a group of legislators who largely disagreed with him was over the summer, at a conference of the Agrarian Party.
"To call that a mistake isn't the right word," Mr. Satarov said. "It's a question of political culture. Personally, I think he should do it more often, but he has an idea of the presidency that is not necessarily mine."
After the elections a year ago, Mr. Yeltsin clearly took stock. The ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky won nearly a quarter of the party preference vote and the re-legalized Communist Party, with its Agrarian allies, did even better. But more important for Mr. Yeltsin was that Mr. Gaidar's Russia's Choice, while becoming the largest single party in Parliament, did not do as well as expected.
In the year since then, the democrats have done little to unify themselves in the face of a nationalist-Communist opposition. Instead, they squabble with one another. Even over Chechnya, members of Mr. Gaidar's party have quit because he has not opposed Mr. Yeltsin sharply enough, not understanding that practical politics may require compromise, and then call for unity.
Mr. Yeltsin seemed to understand that the liberal democrats were too thin a constituency on which to base the rest of his presidency, let alone win a second term. While trying to press ahead with some slower version of economic reform, on other issues, Mr. Yeltsin has moved more clearly into the "rational" nationalist camp, which he perceives to be the country's center.
Mr. Gaidar now says he is breaking with Mr. Yeltsin over Chechnya, but in fact Mr. Yeltsin broke with Mr. Gaidar many months ago.
"Maybe he still wants to be a democrat," a senior Western diplomat said of Mr. Yeltsin. "But shelling the Parliament, pushing through a Constitution with no debate and using the military in Chechnya without exhausting political options are decisions based on a psychology that isn't very democratic. I don't think he can win again, and if he doesn't think so, someone will probably find some pretext not to have elections."
Mr. Satarov thinks the state has the right to use violence when threatened, as in Chechnya. But he wishes Mr. Yeltsin had made his case to the nation before the invasion, not two weeks into it.
"When the state is waging war there's additional insecurity," Mr. Satarov said. "Given that, and our specific politics, it's a critical moment." He said that for Mr. Yeltsin, in Chechnya, "without question, his presidency is at stake."

HEADLINE: Earthwinds Balloon Takes Off But Is Back on Ground in Hours

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: RENO, Dec. 31

 BODY:
After a nearly perfect liftoff, the Earthwinds Hilton was thwarted for the fifth time today in its quest to become the first manned balloon to fly nonstop around the world.
"The crew of the Earthwinds Hilton has just landed safely about 100 miles east of the launch site," said a spokeswoman, Pat Godefroy. 
 The 370-foot, hourglass-shaped craft developed problems in its lower ballast balloon two hours into the flight and slowly descended into the Nevada desert, Ms. Godefroy said.
"We don't know what happened," said the search and rescue coordinator for the project, Phillip J. Conley Jr., a retired Air Force general.
Earthwinds consists of a 190-foot helium gas bag, a small compartment for the three-member crew below that and a 110-foot, air-filled anchor balloon on the bottom as a stabilizer. It cannot fly without the bottom ballast.
Mr. Conley said the crew brought the craft down in a "feather landing."
"The reaction was really a professional, test pilot reaction," Mr. Conley said. "They took all of the right actions at the right time to pull off an incredible feat of airmanship."
Mr. Conley and Cliff Robertson, the actor, who is the Hilton spokesman, were the only project members who would discuss the failure. Mr. Robertson said crew members were meeting to evaluate the setback and it would be several weeks before any decision would be made on the future of Earthwinds.
But, Mr. Robertson said, "We're wedded to a balloon going around the world."
The craft lifted off just before dawn to cheers from volunteers and well-wishers.
Mr. Robertson, who was in a chase plane, said the bottom balloon failed suddenly about two hours into the flight. The crew spent the next three hours slowly lowering the craft from its cruising altitude of 35,000 feet to its landing in a desert valley.
Two previous liftoffs from the Reno Stead Airfield in recent years were carried west by surface winds instead of east.
Today's failure was the fifth defeat for Earthwinds.
Strong wind scotched the first attempt at launching in February 1992 in Akron, Ohio, and sent the project to the Reno area in search of calmer weather. An attempt on Jan. 12, 1993, nearly ended in disaster when the bottom balloon brushed a mountain peak and Earthwinds came down in a snowy canyon in California 10 miles west of here.
A third launching attempt failed on Nov. 5, 1993, when an anchor bolt snapped as the helium balloon neared full inflation. And in January 1994, the craft soared into the sky but the flight was aborted after a crucial valve froze and its finger-thin control shaft snapped.
In a successful liftoff, the craft would soar about 35,000 feet to link up with the jet stream for an eastward trip around the world that is projected to take 12 to 21 days.

HEADLINE: U.S. Threatens $2.8 Billion Of Tariffs on China Exports

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
In the latest of an escalating series of confrontations with China over trade, the Clinton Administration threatened today to impose retaliatory tariffs against $2.8 billion of Chinese exports to the United States unless Beijing cracked down immediately on rampant pirating of American music, movies and computer software.
The move came after an end-of-the-year deadline ran out on negotiations with the Chinese Government, which has refused to close down 29 factories in southern China that churn out 70 million compact disks and other illegally copied products every year, at a cost to American industry that the Administration estimates at $1 billion in sales. American businesses are especially concerned by Chinese exports of these illegal products to other countries in Asia. 
 If any sanctions ultimately take effect, they may hurt a variety of Chinese industries -- including some state-run factories closely linked to Government leaders and their families. But they could also cost American consumers. If the sanctions go into effect on Feb. 4, at the end of a statutory deadline, the prices of items ranging from Chinese-made consumer electronics to toys and clothing will go up.
"We have to send an unambiguous message to Beijing," said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, who has demanded that the Chinese Government create "strike forces" to close down the factories. "By the year 2010 China could be the second-largest economy in the world, and now is not the time to let them continue to act as they have in the past. They have too much impact on the world economy."
Unless the pirating issue is resolved, he said, the United States will continue to block China's effort to join the World Trade Organization, the new international rule-maker and arbiter of trade, which comes into existence on New Year's Day.
In the past, retaliatory threats like the one made today have often proved effective at forcing concessions from China and Japan in a variety of disputes.
But the record has been mixed. Two years ago, the United States threatened similar sanctions against China on the same issue, but backed off when Beijing agreed to pass laws to prevent the illegal copying of foreign products. But none of those laws have been enforced.
In the case of textiles, however, a similar threat from Washington accomplished the American goal of resolving a trade dispute.
The Administration's recent collisions with China extend beyond the immediate arguments over products like the videotape of "The Lion King," which was illegally copied and distributed in China even though it has not been released in the United States. They raise the question of whether President Clinton's decision in May to reverse American policy toward China, renewing its trade benefits without regard to its treatment of political dissidents, is improving either trade relations or human rights. The United States' huge trade deficit with China continues to grow, and repression of Chinese dissidents has continued.
In an angry response just an hour or so after Mr. Kantor's announcement, the Chinese Government threatened to meet any sanctions with retaliation of its own, including a suspension of talks on joint ventures with the big American automobile manufacturers.
"China will have no other choice than to take the counter-retaliatory measures against the trade retaliatory measures of the United States," the official New China News Agency said, quoting from an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. It also threatened to hold up applications of American companies and their subsidiaries to set up holding companies in China, implicitly suggesting that it would give an edge to companies from Japan and other countries that are racing into the Chinese market.
 Despite their heated reaction, Mr. Kantor said Chinese authorities also delivered a letter to the American Embassy in Beijing this morning offering "some criteria for further negotiations." But he said that the document had not been translated yet and he noted that eight previous negotiations on the subject had been fruitless.
Mr. Kantor acted under what is known as the "Special 301" provisions of the 1974 Trade Act, which covers intellectual property. The law requires that after an investigation, which can last up to six months, the trade representative must make an initial determination of whether a country's trade practices are unreasonable.
Mr. Kantor formally announced that decision today and published a list of products that will be the subject of retaliation. That starts a 30-day period for American companies to comment on the list, and to argue -- as many have done when similar action was taken against Japan -- that the sanctions will raise the price of foreign components, and ultimately raise prices for American consumers.
Although Mr. Kantor published a list of $2.8 billion of goods that could be subject to retaliation, the final list will likely be pared to something closer to $1 billion.
When Mr. Clinton abandoned his campaign position last summer that China's "most favored nation" trade benefits should be canceled if it refused to protect the rights of dissidents, he argued that his move would be good for American business and good for the dissidents. American businesses would no longer be handicapped by Washington's political objectives, and thus could compete on equal footing with Japanese and European companies.
Moreover, he argued, "commercial engagement" of China would expose more Chinese to American culture, American business practices and American technology, and probably be more effective in nudging the country toward democracy than any list of sanctions could.
But in the first six months since Mr. Clinton's announcement, evidence is scarce that the strategy is working. Crackdowns against dissidents have only worsened, and China has not followed through on commitments to let the Red Cross visit imprisoned dissidents to check on their conditions in jail. Nor is there much indication that Mr. Clinton's decision to back down has encouraged the Chinese to open their markets to more American goods, or to end the kinds of violations of American intellectual property protections that have poisoned commercial relations.
"I think it is too still early to tell what kind of impact the new policy is having," Jeffrey E. Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce, said last week. "It may be years before we see the kind of benefits we hope for."
The short-term economic impact of trade problems with China is already evident, however. In 1994, according to preliminary estimates, America's trade deficit with China surged to nearly $30 billion, triple the level in 1990. It is second in size only to Japan's trade imbalance with the United States, which is expected to break all records and exceed $60 billion for the year just ended.
China's restrictions on American imports are legion, and many go far beyond some of Japan's most protectionist policies. Because only 10 American films are permitted to be shown in China each year -- a restriction that has both political and commercial roots -- there is particular demand for bootleg copies. Mr. Kantor said recently that when a delegation of American negotiators and business officials visited Beijing to negotiate on the violation of copyrights, their hotel offered them, for a price, a choice of videotapes to watch in their rooms.
"All the videos were stolen off satellite broadcasts," Mr. Kantor said. Even worse, "it turned out that the hotel is owned by the Chinese trade ministry -- and they are the people we're supposed to be negotiating with."
Other American movies have turned out to be hits in China's "video cinemas," which show pirated videos. But Washington's complaints go beyond movies: illegal copies of the Microsoft Corporation's Windows operating system software are widely sold in small computer shops for a fraction of the retail price. Even George Bush's autobiography, which detailed his time as America's first representative to Beijing after the Nixon Administration's opening to China, was published in four pirated Chinese editions.
American industry, however, is less concerned about China's domestic market than its ability to export elsewhere in Asia. By some estimates, China can now produce 75 million compact disks, laser disks, and CD-ROM's -- the computer-data equivalent of CD's -- each year. The Business Software Alliance, which represents leading software publishers, estimates that its members lose more than $300 million a year because of Chinese piracy, and industry officials fear that the number will surge as more software comes out in CD-ROM form.
Chinese officials argue that while they want to stop the piracy, they have little control over it. Most of the factories producing the CD's are in freewheeling southern China, where Beijing's influence is weakest. But Mr. Kantor rejected that argument today.
"They seem to be able to assert control in other areas," he said, a clear reference to the suppression of political opposition. "There is a failure of will here, not a failure of ability." Many of the factories are enterprises run by the central Government or the provinces, and frequently they are closely tied to local and national political leaders.

HEADLINE: THE NEW GOVERNOR: THE OVERVIEW;
Happy Republicans, In From the Cold, Gather for Pataki's Inauguration

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 31

 BODY:
After 20 years in the political wilderness, thousands of jubilant Republicans converged on Albany today to install one of their own, George E. Pataki, as New York's 53d Governor, and to witness the first Republican inauguration since Nelson A. Rockefeller took the oath in 1971.
After a day marked by happy reunions and partisan pride, Mr. Pataki took the oath of office tonight in a private ceremony witnessed by about 100 family members, friends and political supporters in the drawing room of the Executive Mansion, the 40-room house he moved into on Friday night. Although Mr. Pataki wore gray pin stripes, the scene was casual enough that the eldest of his four children, 15-year-old Emily, came barefoot and in bluejeans. 
 At 7:22 P.M., Mr. Pataki placed his left hand on a King James Bible that his wife, Libby, gave to Emily this Christmas and repeated the oath dictated by his counsel and close friend, Michael C. Finnegan, who is also a notary public. Afterward, those in attendance clinked champagne glasses in salute as Mr. Pataki thanked his friends, including his political patron, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
"Senator D'Amato, you get up here," he said. "This is your home, as well."
Tonight's swearing in was designed solely to insure a seamless transition between Mario M. Cuomo and Mr. Pataki at midnight. The ceremony will be repeated on Sunday at a gala inaugural for 14,000 people in Knickerbocker Arena.
Mr. Pataki, a 49-year-old lawyer and legislator from Peekskill, spent the morning at the mansion rehearsing a 30-minute inaugural address that he said would focus on the importance of personal responsibility. Unlike his predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Pataki is not known for his oratorical flourishes and he said his aides chastised him today for speaking too fast during a dry run.
Mr. Pataki said his speech would stress the importance of the individual. "That's something that I think we've gotten away from too much in government," he said at a news conference this afternoon. "We rely too much on government and not enough on the ability of the individual."
In the drawing room at the mansion where Mr. Pataki rehearsed, he had already removed the portrait of Frankin Delano Roosevelt, which Mr. Cuomo gave a place of honor above the mantelpiece, and replaced it with that of his own favorite Governor, Theodore Roosevelt, an advocate of both activist government and a free-market economy.
As they took over the offices in the Capitol occupied for 12 years by Mr. Cuomo and his staff, Mr. Pataki and his top aides showed the inexperience and wonderment of strangers in a new place.
To the delight of photographers, whose shutters clicked giddily, Mr. Pataki spent much of his news conference rubbing his eyes and picking at a nettlesome speck of dirt on a contact lens. His press aides devoted a good bit of their morning to figuring out how to switch on their telephones, and his counsel, Mr. Finnegan, found himself rapping on a locked door, trying to get into the Governor's office.
After the news conference, Mr. Pataki walked down the hallway outside his new office, peering up at the portraits of his predecessors like a schoolboy at a museum. Then he toured the ceremonial gubernatorial office known as the Red Room. Sitting at the broad desk that has been used by a long line of governors, he crossed his long legs and laced his fingers over his knee.
"This was F.D.R.'s desk?" he asked his aides. "This was his office?" Then he and his aides began systematically opening all the drawers and peering inside.
In his first official act, and one that would not take effect until after midnight, Mr. Pataki signed papers reappointing 10 appellate judges whose terms expire today. "Here goes," he said, as he took the gubernatorial pen for the first time.
The Patakis also took a tour of the mansion grounds, with the 6-foot-5 Republican inspecting the basketball court closely. As Mr. Pataki and his wife prepared for the weekend festivities, Emily entertained six school friends whom she had invited to spend Saturday night.
"The kids had a great time," Mr. Pataki said at an afternoon news conference. "They were running all over the place. For me, it's still a little bit uncomfortable. It's going to take some time to feel settled in. I'm used to living in my house and this is not my house. It's the people of the State of New York's house."
The guest list of 14,000 for Sunday's inaugural, which ranges from Mr. Pataki's Yale roommate to the disk jockey Howard Stern, will make the event the largest inaugural in state history. And with a price tag of more than $500,000 in privately raised funds, it is likely to be one of the most expensive as well.
The lavishness of the Republican celebration, which includes a First Lady's luncheon, a performance of children's music, a Roman Catholic Mass, a black-tie gala, and an open house at the mansion, stands in stark contrast to the austerity that Mr. Pataki has promised to bring to state government.
Perhaps more significant than Mr. Pataki's arrival as the first Republican Governor in 20 years is his positioning as the first fiscally conservative Governor in recent state history. He has pledged to cut state income tax rates by 25 percent during his four-year term, to streamline a state bureaucracy of 242,000 workers and to make vast changes in the state's welfare system. He has also said he will restore the death penalty by signing the bill that Mr. Cuomo and his predecessor, Hugh L. Carey, had vetoed every year since 1977.
Mr. Pataki will begin to outline his plans for cutting state spending in the next four days, first in broad terms in his inaugural address on Sunday and then in more detail in his State of the State speech to the Legislature on Wednesday.
Mr. Pataki's inauguration signifies a remarkable transformation of Republican fortunes in New York. Four years ago, the party was deep in debt after a hapless gubernatorial campaign by Pierre A. Rinfret. Today the Republicans control the governorship, the State Senate and New York City's mayoralty.
"I just don't think it gets much better than this," said William D. Powers, the state Republican chairman.
The rank-and-file clearly agreed. "My feeling is jubilation," said Ruton Beauter, a 57-year-old insurance salesman from Owego, who was on his way to witness the swearing in of Dennis C. Vacco as the new Attorney General in the Capitol. "It's exciting and hopefully we can after 20 years be able to get back to what we once were in New York State." His friend, Charles Farrell, a town official from Tioga, chimed in: "100 percent."

HEADLINE: THE NEW GOVERNOR;
Assembling an Administration: Old Friends, Campaign Comrades

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
George E. Pataki begins his term today as the 53d Governor of New York with a team of top advisers who were mostly outsiders to state government. Of the appointments Mr. Pataki has made so far, only one, a holdover from his Democratic predecessor, has held a top position in the New York State executive branch.
Instead, Mr. Pataki has turned to a mixture of old friends, local officials, campaign comrades, business people and associates from the Republican minority in Assembly. He recruited two aides -- his budget director and health commissioner -- from out of state. 
 Another constituency reflected in the new administration are those close to Mr. Pataki's political patron, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Three advisors, including his directors of economic development and of communications, are D'Amato associates.
Mr. Pataki has also taken the untraditional step of making two appointments for only 90 days: He says he recruited Mary E. Glass as commissioner of Social Services and James F. Gill as director of Employee Relations to accomplish the specific tasks of reforming welfare and negotiating with state workers. IAN FISHER

The Night Hunter Made History

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The last of 360 checks for $4,166.67 arrived a couple of weeks ago. One college education provided by a $25,000 annuity policy has been completed; another paid for by the other $25,000 annuity is nearly completed. A third child is a few years away from college, but who knew to ask for an annuity to be named later?
Who knew anything that would come later, after Jim (Catfish) Hunter, free agent, signed with the Yankees 20 years ago last night? 
 "It really was the beginning of the turmoil in baseball's economy," said Peter Bavasi, who as general manager of the San Diego Padres pursued Hunter and thought he had him. "It was the defining moment. If you say how did we get here, how did we get into this mess, a mess that apparently will be solved by legions of lawyers, it happened in Ahoskie, North Carolina, 20 years ago."
Catfish Hunter and his wife, Helen, live in the same house in the tiny town of Hertford, N.C., that they lived in 20 years ago. But the 100 acres of farmland they had then has grown to a sprawling 1,000 acres of farmland and other land.
"It will take over for the payments from the Yankees," said Hunter, now 48 years old and 15 years retired. But he added, updating his resume: "I'm not a full-time farmer anymore. For 10 years I was. I got out of it and turned it over to a friend, who leases my land. I help him some. Mostly I work with Upjohn doing things for them on diabetes. And I work with the baseball alumni."
The monthly payments from the Yankees were part of the $3.1 million package they gave him that memorable New Year's Eve in 1974. Under a provision that would pay him $100,000 a year deferred for 15 years, Hunter received $4,166.67 on the first and 15th of each month beginning Jan. 1, 1980.
The end of the payout period, occurring simultaneously with the owners' implementation of the disputed salary cap, marks an end to the first phase of baseball's freedom era.
The period technically didn't start with Hunter's free agency; that came a year later in the Messersmith-McNally case with the decision by the same arbitrator, Peter Seitz, who declared Hunter free in a breach-of-contract grievance. But Hunter's experience demonstrated to his fellow players what the owners really thought they were worth.
"It served as a wonderful demonstration that players should be paid a lot more than they had been paid," said Richard Moss, who as the Players Association's general counsel argued and won both cases. "The fact that a player who was a free agent could make so much more than if he were confined to one club was a lesson to the players."
In 1974, Hunter had a $100,000 salary with the Oakland Athletics. Bavasi recalled that the Padres thought they could get him with that same salary for each of four years. By the time 23 of the-then 24 major league clubs had sent representatives to Ahoskie or telephoned the pitcher's lawyers there, the price was just shy of $4 million for five years.
The pursuit of baseball's first legitimate star free agent, one who had won 25 games and the Cy Young award that year, shattered the rural serenity that had previously enveloped Ahoskie, a town 60 miles west of Hertford, which is about 70 miles south of Norfolk, Va.
"Gene Autry came down here handing out records of 'Rudolph the Rednose Reindeer,' " Hunter recalled of the California Angels' owner. "That was the biggest thing that ever came to Ahoskie."
Included in the financial package Hunter wanted were the $25,000 payments for annuities for college tuition for Todd, then 5 years old, and Kimberly, 2. Paul was five years away from being born ("I forgot I might have one more after baseball," Hunter said. "I have to pay for him myself.")
When the annuities were being discussed, Bill Posedel, Hunter's first pitching coach, who accompanied Bavasi, looked at his old student and said, "Pal, with what you're going to get, you can buy a small university."
But the Yankees had their own early link to Hunter. Clyde Kluttz, one of their scouts, had signed Hunter to his first professional contract, lived in North Carolina and had remained close to the pitcher. Kluttz was instrumental in luring Hunter to New York even though the Yankees offered nearly $1 million less than the Padres.
Actually, by the time the Yankees became serious about wanting to sign Hunter, Bavasi thought he had a deal. J. Carlton Cherry, one of Hunter's lawyers, seemed to think so, too, though he apparently was looking for an honorable way out.
In a conference call, Bavasi related, one of the Padres' lawyers said there was one thing more. Ray Kroc, the team's owner, who also owned McDonald's, wanted Hunter to serve as the McDonald's spokesman in the Southeast.
Seizing the opportunity, Bavasi said, Cherry yelled: "That's impossible! My client doesn't smoke or drink or dissipate. The deal is off."
Then he turned to the Yankees and negotiated the deal that was finally completed after 8 o'clock on New Year's Eve 20 years ago.
 
Too Much for Too Many
 From the perspective of the player who gained baseball's first multimillion-dollar contract, the attitude of the players 20 years later is alien.
"When Mays and Mantle were making $100,000 or $120,000 or $150,000, something like that, you knew you weren't going to make that much," Catfish Hunter, the Hall of Famer, said. "They were the cream of the crop. But now they act like everybody should make the same. The way guys live now they'd need a million dollars a year to live."
Hunter has always been an unassuming, unpretentious man who did not let his rich contract keep him off his tractor and away from his peanut fields. Whether he had earned $10,000 or $100,000 a year, he would have been the same person.
"Like Clyde Kluttz, who signed me twice, told me," Hunter related. "He says when you're playing baseball, you're making a lot of money, you're going to spend a lot of money, but when you get out, that money isn't going be coming in. You better make sure all your payments are paid up and don't have any left because you won't be making the money."
Having followed that advice, Hunter can only shake his head at the players who live as if they need $1 million just for starters.
 
Tales of Two Stars
 Strike-breaking stories of the week:
A former player who lives in the San Francisco area said he heard that Barry Bonds planned to go to spring training, strike or no strike. Bonds declined a request for an opportunity to respond, but his agent, Dennis Gilbert, vehemently denied that the game's highest-paid player harbors any such thought.
"He's indicated quite the contrary," Gilbert said. "He's going to support the union. Remember, he's got a father who's a former player. That's just so far from the truth. People love to start this stuff. Why would people say that? That's so offensive. It's not the truth. I talk to Barry quite often. Barry is supportive to the union's position."
Whether or not anyone in the union has told Cal Ripken he may play in replacement-player games to keep alive his consecutive-game streak now at 2,009, a Houston pitcher, Todd Jones, was quoted as saying that Ripken has said he intends to remain on strike with the rest of the players.
He hasn't said anything about it recently, but at a meeting in New York in September, the Baltimore shortstop said, "If it's replacement players, it's not major league baseball and I won't be playing."
Greg Swindell, another Astros pitcher, said he would consider playing even if the strike continued. "I've got house payments, I've got ex-wife payments, I've got a 5-year-old, a 3-year-old and a 7-week-old," Swindell said.
Everyone who ever has been on strike has expressed concern about similar economic problems, but probably more often than not, the strikers are workers who earn about $25,000 a year. Swindell has earned $7 million the last two years.

HEADLINE: The Quality of Mercy in 1995

 BODY:
Just over a decade ago, Walter Mondale spoke honorably in a losing Presidential campaign of the need for fairness in Government policy. Democrats in those days talked about the "compassion gap" in a Reagan Administration that conceived of budget cutting mainly as an exercise in taking from the poor. By 1988 the Republican candidate, George Bush, was talking of blending fiscal stringency with a caring heart. The election of Bill Clinton in 1992 seemed a declaration that Americans wanted a government that lifted the needy instead of punishing them.
 But as 1995 dawns, a new band of hard-talking officeholders and social engineers has created a compassion crisis in American political life. Their political energy flows in part from the well-crafted fiction, originally promulgated under President Reagan, that the wealthy are embattled. In fact, of course, wealthy Americans have never been more numerous or more cosseted by Congress, the executive branch and the Federal Reserve Board. 
 Another fiction is that the American people themselves no longer believe in acts of pure mercy toward the powerless and instead want to adopt group punishment as a thematic principle of welfare policy. How else to explain the idea of withdrawing all aid from an infant whose mother does not meet Congressionally mandated rules as to work and sexual behavior?
 In the new anti-compassion demagoguery, anyone who does not embrace primitive remedies is accused of endorsing the imperfections of current policy. But the public-opinion polls show that the American people are not as simplistic as those who propose to speak for them.
 There is, indeed, a decline in support for increased spending on aid to minorities and the unemployed. But a New York Times/CBS News poll found that a majority still favored increased spending for helping the homeless and AIDS victims, for health care, for worker retraining. A Time/CNN poll found that while 78 percent favored welfare reform, a majority opposed ending payments to the destitute after two years. The poll also found that 69 percent would agree to spend more in the short run if that is what it took to get welfare reform started.
 American voters, to be sure, want more efficient social spending and a return to bedrock values of family and community. But one of those values is compassion. Ideologues who cruelly argue that reform means that the majority culture must make war on the underclass are misreading the mood of nearly everyone else.
 Time also reported that Representative Newt Gingrich has called in a psychotherapist to coach the new Congressional majority on how to promote their reforms without looking cruel. Perhaps their dialogue will touch on the fact that the great American leaders of the 20th century have depended on inspiration, not punishment, as their core principle.
 True, the rhetoric of human kindness is out of fashion right now. Those who speak for the old humanitarian ideals are in retreat in Congress and shouted into silence on the talk shows. But that will change in time, or else 1995 will be remembered as the bleak start of a bleak epoch.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Come The Revolution

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
Today marks the return of the "Foreign Affairs" column to The New York Times. "Foreign Affairs" is actually the paper's oldest column. It was begun in 1937 by the remarkable Anne O'Hare McCormick and was originally called "In Europe." In those days "In Europe" was foreign affairs for most Americans, and it seemed perfectly natural that the paper's one overseas columnist was rooted on the European Continent. Mrs. McCormick's 1954 obituary in The Times said she got her start in foreign reporting "as the wife of Mr. McCormick, a Dayton engineer whom she accompanied on frequent buying trips to Europe."
 Obviously, I was born in a very different era, one in which columnists only have to accompany their curiosity and engineers travel to Tokyo for buying trips, not Paris. Both factors have led me to start my column from Japan. While I have no intention of calling my column "In Asia," the thought did cross my mind. Let's face it, when the history of the late 20th century is written, the most important event may not be the reconstruction of Europe, the cold war or the collapse of Communism, but rather the rapid modernization in one generation of two billion people from Japan to the border of India. Never have so many raised their standard of living so far so fast. 
I was recently in Singapore when its Government decided that to keep attracting top-quality Cabinet ministers, it would pay them a percentage of the average salary of the country's senior doctors, bankers and C.E.O.'s. That came to $765,000 a year for the Prime Minister and $400,000 for the others. No wonder an American diplomat in Hong Kong told me: "I go to parties here and without fail I am the poorest person at every event. The BMW's and Rolls-Royces roll in one after the other, and then I show up with my little Japanese car. During my first tour here a decade ago, I felt like Gulliver among the Lilliputians. We represented the future. Now I feel like I am brought along to parties as a potted plant for adornment."
 Yet, Walter Mondale, our Ambassador to Japan, complains that many American business, educational and news organizations "still don't get it, still don't grasp how rich and dynamic this region is." He should know. The historic American ambassador's residence in Tokyo is being restored by a Japanese construction company because there were no American contractors here skilled enough to do the delicate job. A new study by the Mansfield Center found that there is still four times as much news about America on Japanese television as news of Japan on American television.
 But if we are still smug about Asians, always waiting for their bubble to burst, it is nothing compared with their smugness toward America. They think they can defy the laws of gravity -- that economic consequences won't have political consequences. You can't have a conversation in Asia without being verbally caned over how flawed America has become and how superior is the "Asian Way." Their smugness, though, is as misplaced as ours.
 How long can Asian governments keep their people so regimented and focused on export growth when their middle classes are growing so wealthy? Take Singapore. Thanks to its heavy-handed Government, it is clean, rich and seriously boring. Singapore is a shopping mall with passport controls. Any wonder American televangelists and Oprah Winfrey are increasingly popular out there?
 How long can Japan's Government keep telling its youth that they have to accept lower wages and live in apartments as big as my garage so that Japanese companies can put all their profits into expanding markets abroad? How long will Japanese consumers pay $70 for a watermelon because Japan protects its highly inefficient food industry from foreign competition?
 How long is China's leadership, the smuggest of all since it forced President Clinton to eat crow on human rights, going to be able to keep the lid on a country that is economically becoming North Carolina and politically still North Korea? And how long will Asians tolerate the fact that the economic boom has left them with five of the seven most polluted cities in the world?
 The answer to all of the above is: not much longer, and that's why I chose to start here. Asia is not only going to be the world's biggest business story in the coming years. The economic revolution here is well under way, but the political revolution has just begun.

It Makes Perfect Sense to Be a Good Neighbor
 
Looking at it from a coldly practical angle, this nation can't afford to have the Mexican economy fall apart. Just as a ramshackle house stains a whole neighborhood, a tattered Mexico would be a big headache for its mighty cousin to the north. So it made total sense last week when Washington decided to pump billions into Mexico to prop up the battered peso. And President Ernesto Zedillo soon saw the necessity of some falling on swords, accepting the resignation of his Finance Minister, Jaime Serra Puche, whose prints were all over the currency mess. Mr. Zedillo also announced a drastic emergency plan, including deep concessions from labor, big spending cuts and a slowdown of economic growth. As it happens, Mr. Serra's replacement, Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, tried in the fall to show the need for an orderly devaluation, but no one listened. They are now.
 
Give and It Shall Be Taken
 
From Britain, today's lesson: Never, ever underestimate the public's willingness to take full advantage of anything that's free. A mobile-phone company called Mercury One-2-One wanted a catchy promotion for its "personal communications services" -- it's among the first in the world to offer this radio-wave-based phone technology -- so it offered free calls on Christmas for new subscribers. What it no doubt figured on: customers merrily making a few calls to relatives, then getting back to the day's festivities. What it got: jammed lines, 10 times normal volume, 12-hour international calls, some people making 100 calls, others not able to get through at all. In short, chaos.
 
Japan's Humbled Self-Image
 
Japan strikes a bit less terror in American hearts these days, and even the Japanese admit that their mighty economic machine has been badly humbled. Just three years ago, 53 percent of Japanese said they expected Japan to lead the world economic pack for quite a while. A recent poll shows, though, that that's plummeted to 25 percent. And what's the next powerhouse? A big difference of opinion on that one -- fully a quarter of the Japanese, but a scant 4 percent of Americans, picked China. One feeling persists in Japan, though: 83 percent of Japanese believe their blue-collar workers work harder than Americans -- and that number's held pretty steady.
 
Mr. Pataki Seems to Mean It
 
George Pataki sent some powerful signals last week that he is dead serious about his economic vision for New York. First he named a new budget director, Patricia Woodworth, who as Michigan's budget director has zeroed in on cutting taxes and state spending. A key item on her resume: Michigan's move this year to end local schools' dependence on property taxes. She said that approach would be tough in New York, though. Mr. Pataki also found a Commissioner of Social Services in Mary Glass, who holds the same job in Westchester (she'll have to work fast; she's returning to that job in three months). On her watch, 60 percent of those on home relief were dropped for failing to work. The ship of state is clearly shaping up as a tight one.
 
The West, Yes; the Coast, No
 
It's really true. Though New Yorkers persist in thinking they are at the center of the universe, New York, alas, has suffered the indignity of falling behind Texas to be No. 3 on the state population list. But Census figures out last week also highlighted an interesting aspect of this nation's great tilt westward: it stops before it gets to the ocean. The big growth spurts are coming one or two states in from the West Coast, like Nevada, up 5.4 percent, and Arizona, up 3.3 percent. And how about California? Yes, it's still easily No. 1, but it now ranks just 35th in growth. The state's sour economy is clearly no draw these days.
 
Mutual Funds: Doing Fine (So Far)
 
The public made a startling discovery last year: mutual funds are not invincible. Investors scurried away from bond funds, but a sickly stock market couldn't stop stock funds from slogging ahead. True, the net $3 billion that flowed in in November was the lowest since 1991, but that marked the 49th straight month that more has come in than gone out -- easily the longest streak ever. Maybe people, even when gloomy, can't think of a better place to put their cash.
 
Shoppers Always Show Up
 
It makes no sense. Stores panic in early December, then run sales even before Christmas, and -- wonder of wonders! -- the hordes arrive. Don't retailers know that this nation's citizens are genetically programmed for holiday excess? They have to show up, always at the last minute. So it was that retailers, tallying it all up last week, found that sales weren't bad but profits were poor -- because of markdowns. One footnote: plastic was big. Visa and Mastercard both reported hefty increases in credit-card purchases. Maybe people are using cards more for their daily bread, but it could also spell empty stores now as people wrestle those Visa bills back to earth.
 
Something Completely Different
 
On New Year's Day, this page would be incomplete without a roundup of Top Stories of '94. On second thought, that's a dumb idea. Instead, here's an exclusive look at what will surely be the Top Story of '95: All the people who made money on derivatives (if billions were lost, billions had to be made, right?) will be overwhelmed by remorse and holiday spirit and send checks to Orange County.
 
BRITS ZIP UP TMS. SQ.!
 
It's called the zipper, that ribbon of lit-up news on the 43d Street end of Times Square. And even in an age when people get up-to-the-second news practically piped into their brains, the passing throng can easily be seduced into watching the headlines emerge, word * by * rolling * word. In 1928, soon after it was born, the zipper carried news of Hoover's victory, and with a few interruptions, it's been blinking ever since. But Newsday, which has run the billboard since 1986, pulled out recently, raising the possibility that zipper junkies would go headline-less come New Year's Eve. Relax. Last week Pearson, the British conglomerate that puts out The Financial Times and The Economist, picked up the lease.
 
Senate to House: Drop Deal
 
Newt Gingrich's sojourn in the land of big-bucks publishing was a brief one. Last week Bob Dole raised his powerful eyebrows at Mr. Gingrich's $4.5 million deal to write two books for a publisher owned by Rupert Murdoch, who happens to have regulatory business with Congress. Mr. Gingrich soon scrapped the deal, saying he'd take just a $1 advance and patiently await his royalties. He had to "do what's good for the country," Mr. Gingrich said; even though it was a "legal and ethical deal," he didn't want the new Congress "to be slowed down or distracted," even for a second. David Bonior, the Michigan Democrat who is showing signs of being a feisty anti-Gingrich, said Mr. Gingrich "finally got the message."
 
Insurance With a Difference
 
Life insurance. It conjures images of endless mailings and sales pitches -- and it's the last thing people want to think about anyway. So selling it is tough, and many agents don't last. But a New York sales agent named Steven Genovese, prosecutors say, had a better idea. An indictment last week asserted that for years he presented phony applications, wrote bad checks for a few payments, and pocketed his commission -- perhaps half the first year's premium. If a policy's canceled, part of the commission should be returned, but that didn't happen this time -- and no procedure was in place to track such fraud. Agents can job-hop leaving barely a footprint. Even Mr. Genovese's lawyer admitted that the system "could almost seduce people into fraudulent conduct."
 
A Bullet Too Far
 
Well, David Keen decided last week that the world did not need, just yet, a bullet that not only pierces armor but splits into razorlike shards and does all sorts of nasty, nasty stuff. Mr. Keen, who heads an Alabama company called Signature Products, backed down after stiff police opposition to the company's bullet, which he says is needed because criminals often wear bulletproof vests. Of course, some people say that his bullet isn't even possible, that it's all a hoax, that he was helping the gun-control lobby more than anyone. The one thing that's certain: he got a lot of attention.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Man of the Year: High-Wire Artist Alan Greenspan

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
BURSTING a speculative bubble is easy for a central banker. Doing so without killing a lot of innocent bystanders is not. Alan Greenspan may have accomplished the task.
 The operative phrase is "a lot," and there are many people who would disagree with it. Certainly there were many speculators who suffered greatly as a result of the Federal Reserve's tightening of credit, including some who did not know they were speculating. But the Fed managed to unwind huge speculation on interest rates with only minimal damage to the stock market and the economy. 
The bubble was, to be sure, in large part a creation of Mr. Greenspan. When the American banking system was reeling from the effect of bad loans in 1990, the Fed and its chairman helped to engineer a prolonged period of falling interest rates and -- perhaps more importantly -- a very steep yield curve. With short rates much lower than long rates, banks could pay less for deposits and make a nice profit buying government bonds.
 As time went on, more and more people began to play that game, and to convince themselves they were geniuses because the money rolled in. The derivatives market made it easier to make those bets, and easier to conceal from the unsophisticated just what was being done. Getting out of the way when Mr. Greenspan changed the rules in February required nimble footwork that few could manage, and 1994 produced a line of humiliated speculators including Piper Jaffray's Worth Bruntjen and Orange County's Robert Citron.
 "There was," says Ed Yardeni, C. J. Lawrence's chief economist, "a lot more speculation on the yield curve than anyone imagined."
 It can be argued that the bond market carnage would have been less if the Fed and Mr. Greenspan had moved sooner, but that is asking for a lot. The Fed's freedom of action -- and the remarkable lack of political opposition -- came in part from the fact it did not act hastily. By Feb. 4, when it first moved to push up short-term interest rates, it was clear that the economy was strengthening. Even the American Bankers Association was pushing for Fed action, which is a little like the Saloonkeepers' League proposing an increase in the minimum drinking age.
 As 1994 began, three-month Treasury bills paid 3 percent and 30-year Treasury bonds yielded 6.3 percent. Now the figures are 5.5 percent and 7.9 percent, and bond market investors have lost a lot of money. But the Dow Jones industrial average actually eked out a small gain for the year, something few would have predicted had they correctly forecast the rate picture.
 To be sure, that is a bit misleading, concealing volatility that was especially damaging to interest-rate sensitive stocks such as homebuilders and utilities. But it is remarkable that there was no notable bear market, even as the Fed was choking off intense bond market speculation. It helped that the tightening came as corporate profits were exceeding expectations. It also helped that stock prices, while not cheap, were not at the ridiculous valuations that preceded Mr. Greenspan's baptism by fire as chairman, the 1987 crash.
 "A bubble can easily be punctured," John Kenneth Galbraith wrote in reviewing the 1929 crash. "But to incise it with a needle so that it subsides gradually is a task of no small delicacy." It may be that Mr. Greenspan has done it.

HEADLINE: Big Environment Hits a Recession

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
CONSUMERS respond listlessly to much of their marketing and research. Revenues are tumbling. Energetic competitors are making inroads into the core customer base. In Washington, credibility and clout are at a low point.
 An assessment of a flagging industrial corporation? Hardly. Rather it is a summary of the dismal performance that made 1994 the most troubling year ever for many of the nation's largest environmental organizations. 
What happened? As the year ended the national media took a crack at the question. "Past its prime," USA Today said of the national environmental movement. "Groping for a vision," added The Los Angeles Times. The Nation, in perhaps the harshest critique, accused the movement's senior executives of being "elitist, highly paid, detached from the people, indifferent to the working class and a firm ally of big Government."
 Time for a shakeout? Though painful for those executives and staff members involved, it probably would not be such a bad thing for American environmentalism. At least that is the conclusion reached by the Center for the Study of American Business, an economic research group affiliated with Washington University in St. Louis.
 In a report published last month, "Restructuring Environmental Big Business," the center said the turmoil in the national environmental groups had largely been caused by their own mismanagement. During the 1980's, when times were good, the groups lost focus and direction in a headlong drive for growth, only to suffer later. In short, the report concludes, the environmental groups made the same mistakes that many American corporations made during the 1980's.
 "By significantly expanding the scale and scope of their groups' activities, the directors of environmental organizations hoped to capitalize on Americans' increasing demands for environmental quality," the report stated. "Unfortunately, as many U.S. corporations have discovered, expansion away from an organization's core competency often has numerous disadvantages."
 The center's study has created a stir in the environmental movement, prompting both criticism and soul-searching.
 Some environmental leaders, like John Adams, the executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, say that the report's conclusions are wrong. Mr. Adams calls the report "a political document and not a scientific study," noting that the center's director is Murray L. Weidenbaum, the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan Administration, which was viewed as an enemy by environmentalists.
 Others say that a softening economy and the Clinton Administration's professed support for the environment is a more accurate explanation for the loss of backing for conservation groups.
 "The No. 1 cause of our problems has been the economy," said Ben Beach, the chief spokesman of the Wilderness Society in Washington. "When the economy went down, so did our membership. The election of Clinton and Gore also didn't help. Some people believed there was less need to support environmental causes."
 But the center's conclusions are being embraced by other environmental leaders as an accurate appraisal of some of the causes underlying the turmoil in their movement.
 "We in the not-for-profit business are subject to the same forces as any other business," said Ted Eubanks, a director of the National Audubon Society who has ordered 50 copies of the report to distribute to the group's senior leaders. "Our business is basically communications and we've lost the imagination of the average guy in the street."
 The study's authors, Christopher Boerner and Jennifer Chilton Kallery, are researchers at the center. They spent more than a year studying the financial statements, tax documents and other information collected from five of the most influential environmental groups: the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Audubon Society, the Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society and the Nature Conservancy.
 Those five organizations, which in the early 1970's were either small or brand new, have become the core of a quite substantial nonprofit industry that employs thousands of highly educated professionals. The five groups still claim 2.1 million dues-paying members, down from a peak of 2.4 million in 1990. In 1993, they collected $396 million from membership dues, foundations, contributions and sales of publications.
 The Nature Conservancy, which alone accounted for $278.5 million in revenues and nearly $1 billion in assets in 1993, is cited by the authors as the only one of the five groups that has not been buffeted by declining revenue or membership. The study says the reason is that the Nature Conservancy, which avoids the political fray, also did not swerve from its sole mission of buying and conserving wild land.
 The other groups diversified at their peril. Starting with core campaigns in the 1970's to make the air and water cleaner and protect natural resources, those groups in the 1980's established large and elaborate programs to address a wide array of more scientifically complex and politically difficult issues like global warming and saving obscure animals. To support such work, the groups expanded their lobbying and public relations staffs, particularly in Washington, and helped to pioneer the media-driven techniques of modern public interest campaigns.
 The authors argue that the new strategy was not only designed to address an expanding menu of environmental concerns but also to attract the extra financing and membership that would support growth. From 1983 to 1990, for example, the Wilderness Society's budget more than quadrupled, to $17.9 million, from $4.3 million. From 1974 to 1993, the budget of the National Resources Defense Council grew to $20.5 million, from $1.5 million.
 Ms. Chilton Kallery and Mr. Boerner argue, though, that there were both limits to the financing available and the number of Americans that were truly interested in all the new issues. The competition for financing became so fierce, the authors said, that it led to two unexpected outcomes.
 First, to "differentiate themselves and rally public support, environmental groups began employing highly emotional, and often misleading, campaigns," the report said. "Organizations have used fear and apocalyptic prophecies to further their political objectives." For example, a recent fund-raising mailing from the National Audubon Society said the group could "project with some accuracy the eventual end of the natural world as we know it."
 "That is no trees," the letter said. "No wildlife."
 And second, such tactics helped generate a powerful countermovement of scientists, city officials, business executives and landowners who began to ask questions about the methods and priorities of national environmental groups. To some extent the critics have been joined by grass-roots environmental leaders who also have been attacking the national organizations as too bureaucratic and uninterested in the land-use questions and community pollution concerns that are important to many more Americans.
 Mr. Boerner and Ms. Chilton Kallery said the critics raised doubts about the credibility of national environmental groups, an erosion that was responsible for slowing growth, and in some cases reversing budgets and membership. The Sierra Club now counts 500,000 members, which is 130,000 fewer than in 1990. Since 1990, the Wilderness Society's membership has fallen by 125,000, to 275,000 today, while its budget of $15 million is $2.9 million less than in 1990. The National Audubon Society recorded a deficit of $1.7 million in 1993 and is reducing its staff and cutting programs.
 The solution, the authors say, may come only after more cuts are made. "In order to regain their influence on public policy," the report said, "environmental big business should follow many of their private-sector counterparts -- trim down and stick to core competencies."

HEADLINE: Is the Administration Really Business Friendly?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I was gratified to see recognition from a variety of business executives of the substantive progress achieved during the Clinton Presidency. 
The litany of lower interest rates, increased employment, passage of Nafta and GATT is familiar, yet many members of the business community are still carping about President Clinton. I believe the President has surrounded himself with talented economic thinkers and doers through the creation of the National Economic Council.
 The President has followed through by elevating the focus on the American economy to the level of the National Security Council. Furthermore, this is the first administration to include the head of the Small Business Administration at the Cabinet table.
 I have benefited from Clinton economic policies, not only through the historic bond rally in 1993 creating the lowest interest rates in 20 years, but also through a pilot program I am conducting with the S.B.A. to sell surplus Government assets on the information highway.
 I mention this to emphasize the need to appreciate the progress made by this Administration. I am reminded of the story of the mother giving two ties to her son for his birthday. One day he comes downstairs wearing one of the new ties. His mother then asks, "What's the matter, you don't like the other tie?" Similarly the business community has accomplished a great deal since the Clinton Presidency has begun, but it still complains and question.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Awaiting Mexico's Plan to Revive Peso

BYLINE: By Paul Lewis

 BODY:
THE financial community awaits the address that President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon will make to the Mexican people -- not to mention their foreign creditors -- on Monday, discussing his plan for restoring confidence in the country's battered currency and economy.
 Bankers and analysts in London and New York are unanimous in believing that the Zedillo and Clinton Administrations have mishandled the peso devaluation so far, turning a manageable crisis into a major monetary disaster that could hamstring the Mexican economy for years to come. 
One senior New York banker, with expertise in Latin America, who asked not to be identified, is convinced that President Zedillo could have avoided floating the peso completely if he had coupled the devaluation announcement with a strong package of domestic and international support measures, including a ringing declaration of confidence from President Clinton.
 Instead, the markets received a steady drip of hesitant, poorly explained moves by the Mexican authorities, with no ostensible backing from the United States, which only encouraged capital flight, bankers say.
 The key issue now is whether President Zedillo will announce credible national and international steps on Monday to control inflation, service Mexico's foreign debt and raise additional revenue from privatizations to keep the budget balanced in 1995.
 "They lack experience in crisis management," said the Latin American strategist for Salomon Brothers, Alfredo Viegas. "What we need is leadership. But there's an unfortunate confluence of events, a new, divided Government in Mexico, no Treasury Secretary in the United States and the Republicans taking over Congress next month."
 Sarah Lavers, of the London research firm Latinvest Securities, added: "Everything has been too late. No one seems in command. It doesn't instill confidence."
 Global Investing, a newsletter tracking foreign stocks traded in New York, said in its latest issue that "there hasn't been such a mishandled devaluation since Harold Wilson's in England in 1967."
 After Mexico attempted a devaluation of 15 percent but was forced to float instead, former Finance Minister Jaime Serra Puche rushed to New York to give a secret pep talk to leading bankers. The move backfired. The economic measures that Mr. Serra promised were vague. And the Under Secretary of the Treasury, Lawrence H. Summers, made matters worse by appearing without giving the Mexicans any public support, those who attended said.
 "There is a very strong view expressed among investors that the Government is not fully in control of economic policy" Salomon Brothers told its clients afterward in a confidential fax.
 Last week, as rumors of an American-led support package for Mexico circulated, the United States Treasury refused to provide details or even a clear statement that help was on the way. Only the replacement of Finance Minister Serra by Guillermo Ortiz brought markets some cheer.
 "The public relations side of this has been a disaster," said James Colmenares of Morgan Stanley Asset Management. "But Ortiz is good news. Very sharp. Very market-saavy."
 Of course, handling the public relations side of a currency devaluation is not easy. And Mexico is far from the first country to get things wrong.
 In the winter of 1967, leaks indicating that Prime Minister Wilson's Labor Government was frantically shopping for new loans cost the Bank of England billions of dollars in lost reserves, including $1 billion on Nov. 18 alone, the day before the Government threw in the towel.
 More successful was President Charles de Gaulle's emphatic "non" a year later to a devaluation considered inevitable. This put the mother of all bear squeezes on speculators, enabling the franc to hold its own until President Georges Pompidou's surprise devaluation the following August.
 If President Zedillo gets it right on Monday, what should investors buy? Ideally, strong exporting companies without dollar debts.
 "The trouble is, there aren't many around," said Jean ven der Walle of Alliance Capital Management. He said he liked Interceramica, a tile manufacturer with substantial exports to the United States, and the San Luis mining and auto parts company, which makes auto parts for the American market.
 But many analysts suspect Mexico's woes will encourage investors to look south toward Brazil, whose economic prospects seem more hopeful. "Brazil will be the winner," Mr. Viegas said, noting that the Sao Paolo market was only 17 percent foreign-owned, compared with 35 percent for the Mexican market.
His favorite choices are Companhia Rio do Valle Doce, the world's largest exporter of iron ore, and the Government-controlled electricity and communications monopolies, Eletrobras and Telebras, which are candidates for privatization.

HEADLINE: In Ukraine, a Free-Market Lesson Learned Too Well

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine

 BODY:
FOR three years, the United States lectured a recalcitrant and bankrupt Ukraine about the virtues of a market economy with little effect. But some enterprising factories understood. The trouble was, they understood too well.
 Stylishly cut and well-finished women's wool coats from Ukraine became such hot items on Seventh Avenue that Washington slapped a quota on them in November. 
The curb threatens to halt the strong growth in a new export industry that Ukraine badly needs. The Ukrainian economy has been in a free-fall since independence from the Soviet Union was declared in 1991, raising worries about the new country's stability.
 The Clinton Administration has stressed repeatedly that Ukraine -- a nation straddling Russia and Eastern Europe, with 52 million people -- is strategically important to America. At the same time that Washington is restricting its commercial access to the United States, Ukraine is a leading recipient of American foreign aid -- $700 million pledged in 1994.
 So, to shield a relative handful of coat makers in Maine and elsewhere from overseas competition, Washington seems to be endangering its foreign policy goals. Perhaps, but American officials reply that the quota was mainly a routine case of applying United States trade rules.
 For coat makers and workers here, the American move seems like a slap in the face, and it has made their future suddenly uncertain. At the Yunost coat factory, Svetlana V. Gorchinskaya worries that a shipment of double-breasted camel coats, slickly packed in plastic covers and bearing the Donnybrook label, might be the last big order from the United States.
 Until recently, her factory had been adding to its payroll to handle the surge in business, with orders for 1995 increasing sharply. But the quota on coat shipments from Ukraine has dashed the Yunost factory's plans for 1995. To cope with the expected slowdown in orders, Mrs. Gorchinskaya, the factory's technical director, has already laid off 300 workers, nearly one-third of the work force.
 "If there's no work, there's no money for us to pay," she said, surveying bolts of camel and black fabric ordered for this year's coats that lie on the floor of the warehouse. "Our people are at home without pay because of this quota problem."
 The wool coats -- trench, double-breasted, single-breasted, swing, belted, indeed any way customers want them and selling at department stores and clothing retailers across the United States for $89 to $139 each -- brought protests of unfair trade from the American woolen textile industry.
The imports of coats from Ukraine, estimated at $30 million a year, are tiny compared with America's yearly apparel import bill of $30 billion, according to the United States Association of Importers and Apparel, a trade group. But shipments have increased sharply. In the year ended last September, Ukraine exported 88,898 dozen women's coats -- or 1,066,776 coats -- to the United States, up 155 percent from the year before, the Commerce Department said.
 By 1994, Ukraine's coat exports to the United States had mushroomed to such an extent that they were outstripped only by coats from the Dominican Republic and Guatemala, two countries to which the United States gives preferential trade. Under the Caribbean Basin Initiative, the Dominican Republic and Guatemala do not face quotas on women's coats.
 The sudden surge of Ukrainian imports brought pressure for import restraint from domestic coat makers, who were supported by Senator George Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, and the Commerce Department. Textiles and apparel remain among the most protected sectors of trade in most nations, even though the new rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will eliminate many curbs. And even without the quota, American producers are protected by a tariff of 21.5 percent on wool coat imports.
 The Ukrainian coat imports were classified as "disruptive" to the American women's manufacturing industry. The disruptive finding, though vague, was sufficient to justify imposing a quota in a niche of the American apparel industry where employment has declined fairly steadily for years.
 According to a senior official at the United States Trade Representative's office, some of the Ukrainian coats were landing in the United States at $212 a dozen. "This was not the absolute lowest, but among the lowest" price of imported coats, the official said, adding, "they're very nice looking coats." Indeed, the coats made in Ukraine have a reputation in the industry for being of higher quality than those sewn in other developing countries.
 In theory, the coat quota was negotiated with Ukraine's Government. But the Ukrainian officials were informed by Washington that the United States could unilaterally impose import quotas on them if they did not voluntarily accept restrictions. Besides Ukraine, the United States has quota agreements on women's wool coats with 15 other countries, including Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Poland.
 The quota on Ukrainian coats maintains imports at roughly last year's levels. The quota, the trade representative's office says, was set during negotiations with the Ukrainians at 85,000 dozen for 1995, or 1,020,000. And an extra quota of 25,000 coats, which can be added to shipments in 1995, was set for the last three months of 1994.
 But the restrictions will slow growth abruptly in 1995. Ukrainian coat makers here say the quota represents half the orders that the Ukrainian coat industry received from American importers for this year.
 For Ukraine's Government, the curbs on coat shipments is a setback for the reformers who are just beginning to win a battle for liberalization of their economy.
An official at the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Andre Houcheruk, said he was "really disappointed" that one of his nation's strong export industries was being penalized.
 "We have just liberalized our export policy and I don't think America should hurt us in exports that bring us hard currency," Mr. Houcheruk said. "When I spoke to people at the State Department, they were just shaking their heads. They had no answer."
 The biggest importer, Donald Levy, president of Lou Levy and Sons, a Seventh Avenue coat company, who brought in close to one million Ukrainian coats in 1994, described the quota as "the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of."
 "It's ridiculous because it's not saving anything here in the United States; the industry is dying anyway," said Mr. Levy, whose labels include Donnybrook.
 THE quota would hurt the Ukrainians who needed the business but it would not affect him, Mr. Levy said. If he was barred from getting the number of coats he wanted from Ukraine, he said he would go elsewhere for them.
 Another importer, Irwin Bercovitch, director of Irwin Fashion Imports, said: "Ukraine is exporting its labor and importing our currency; it can only help the country. I can't understand why Washington is doing this."
 Both importers said that while they would still be able to buy Ukrainian coats, though not in the quantities they would like, the mere presence of the quotas made the business less attractive and more bureaucratic.
 The Ukrainian coat industry owes its development partly to the collapse of the Soviet Union, but it was also helped by Communist central planning.
 American fashion importers, who are constantly scouring the world for new sources of inexpensive goods, discovered Ukraine after the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991. They found that a century-old tradition of good sewing had not been completely corrupted by the Communists. And because of a state planning decision in 1989 to upgrade the textile industry, some factories, like the Yunost plant, are equipped with modern automated European and Japanese equipment. The renovated Yunost plant, for example, boasts computerized pattern making.
 Both Mr. Levy and Mr. Bercovitch said they dealt with factories all over Ukraine and not all were as modern as the Yunost operation. Some plants, which were making fashion coats after years of producing military uniforms, were located in remote areas reachable only by hard and long travel on rough roads.
 Most of the Ukrainian coat makers are essentially cutting and stitching shops. The importers typically provide the fabric -- usually bought in Russia but also purchased in Europe -- the designs, the trims, even the labels.
 Mrs. Gorchinskaya said her factory was paid $4.50 a coat by the American importers. The price covered labor for cutting, sewing, pressing and packing, she said. Her workers, she said, receive the equivalent of about $40 a month.
 For Mrs. Gorchinskaya, who has been in the Ukrainian textile business for nearly 40 years and also now sells to Germany, the American coat quota is mystifying.
 "It's not a secret that our textiles are cheaper and that our labor force is cheaper than in the United States," she said. "I hope things work out, because at bottom it's helpful to us and to Americans -- they get cheap, good quality coats from us."
 And there was a darker side, she said. The American decision to restrict Ukrainian imports, Mrs. Gorchinskaya added, played into the hands of the reactionary forces in the Government opposed to the new liberalization policies of President Leonid Kuchma.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Summing Up a Gruesome Year

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
CALL it ugly.
 For mutual funds, 1994 was ugly in terms of performance -- most stock and bond investors lost money. And from the industry's viewpoint, it was ugly as one scandal followed another and even uglier as the cascading cash inflows of the previous year began to falter. 
But 1994's tough market was bound to come along sooner or later, and it pulled down lofty valuations to more reasonable levels. Accordingly, investors are well-advised to adjust expectations; the incredible bull market returns many have come to consider usual are over, at least for now.
 Despite some industry embarrassments, ranging from losses in government bond funds created by investments in derivative securities to Fidelity Investments' mispricing of its funds' shares, "no issue affected a majority or even a vast minority of funds," said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago.
 So how did cash beat stocks and bonds in 1994? The biggest culprit was the Federal Reserve, which has pushed up interest rates six times since February. Higher interest rates play havoc with bond prices, and Treasury bond funds, often viewed as a safe haven, lost more than 4 percent of their value, on average, through Dec. 29, because they tend to own longer-term issues, which react most violently to rate shifts.
 Not that other bondholders had much to brag about. Among taxable bonds, corporate bond funds lost 3.7 percent -- their first loss in more than 20 years. Junk bonds lost almost 4 percent.
 Municipal bond funds did even worse, losing slightly more than 5 percent. Funds owning mortgage-backed securities fared slightly better, down 3.5 percent. True to their charter, adjustable-rate mortgage funds were the group's best performers, down slightly more than 2 percent.
 Among equities, nearly all funds were losers, down 2.1 percent on average.
 The two winning categories of funds invested in small sectors of the market, with technology funds up 12.5 percent and health care funds up almost 4 percent.
 Funds investing in European stocks managed to break even. But funds in Pacific Rim stocks were down more than 7 percent, on average, surpassed only by gold (down 9.3 percent).
 As for bad news in the industry, the year started with the Invesco Group of Denver dismissing John Kaweske, a fund manager, after accusing him of not complying with rules on personal trading. That led to a study by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which concluded that there were few personal-trading cases in the industry.
 Then there were spectacular blowups in government bond funds that owned derivative securities. Those came to be symbolized by huge losses in Piper Jaffray closed-end trusts. Shareholders in Paine Webber's Short-Term U.S. Government Income Fund were reimbursed by the company for similar losses, an acknowledgment that funds sold as conservative should manage their portfolios that way, Mr. Rekenthaler said. Derivatives are a continuing problem, he added, as evidenced by the fact that some funds hold issues of Orange County, Calif., which has declared bankruptcy.
 In the fall, a bank-run money fund finally "broke a buck" -- falling below $1 a share -- the first in the industry to do so and a sharp reminder that money funds are not insured by the Government.
 The lesson for investors: Be informed and wary, Mr. Rekenthaler said. Watch out for yields that look too good to be true because they probably are.
 From the industry's perspective, cash flow into bond and fixed-income funds has been fairly light. The funds grew by an estimated $15 billion in 1994, compared with $145 billion in 1993, said Dean P. Eberling, first vice president specializing in financial services at Prudential Securities Inc. in New York.
 On the other hand, redemptions have been light, too, after peaking in March. "Considering the severity of the bond market declines, it's surprising that the retail investor has been so calm," Mr. Eberling said.
 Over all, net new sales of stock and bond funds should total roughly $140 billion this year, compared with $280 billion in 1993 and $197 billion in 1992, he said.
 Mr. Eberling said the most important event for the industry this year was the flattening of the yield curve in December. When the spread in yields between short- and long-term issues narrows, people tend to keep their money in money market funds or short-term investments.
 Growth in the fund industry in 1995 "will come from short- and intermediate-term products," he said, while growth in equities and long-term bonds could slip below 1991 levels.
 Even so, the fund industry "is still in a position to become the dominant intermediary of the wealth-creation process in the U.S.," Mr. Eberling said. And that could be helped by a comeback of individual retirement accounts -- "which won't affect 1995 but could be a psychological plus for stocks in 1996," he said.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
With the New Year, New Scams

BYLINE: By Susan Antilla

 BODY:
AN investor stampede for mutual funds that invest in "Republican" investment plays? A brokerage firm that cleans up selling its underwritings of Chinese cellular phone companies to United States municipalities? Where will the financial scams, disasters and embarrassments of 1995 be found? And will the D-word -- derivatives -- stay in the headlines?
Derivatives disasters no doubt will continue, the pros say, as will misleading enticements to investors who log on to the financial screens of on-line services. 
But, "I promise you there will be a new scam in 1995, because there is one every year," says Michael Stolper of Stolper & Company in San Diego, who evaluates money managers for rich people. And where might the blowups and shady dealings of 1995 be? The pros came up with their best bets:
* Precious metals scams. Mr. Stolper says it is a no-brainer to predict that investors will be getting cold calls from boiler-room operators pushing the ultimate inflation-avoidance play: gold, silver, and diamond mining companies. "The world is really negative on stocks and bonds," he says, "and with the Fed raising rates, you can write a pretty good script that plays on the idea that Alan Greenspan knows something" about a looming inflation crisis.
 Watch for cold-callers who tell a tale of a great supply-demand picture boosted by everything from the hoarding of gold in Asia to the inability of mines to get production at full throttle. "Whether it's futures, commodities, options on futures, or some piece-of-garbage company that trades in Salt Lake City, you'll see the boiler rooms selling the idea over the phone," he says.
 * Initial public offering blowups. The casualties are already being counted, but the real carnage is yet to be seen, says money manager David Dreman of Dreman Value Management. In 1995, "all these sizzling new concepts and funds" will be further humbled, and investors further educated, Mr. Dreman says.
 Mr. Dreman is expecting the worst from the companies that went public in 1993 and early 1994 and played on the stories of the day: health care, the information highway, and emerging markets. He says investors were particularly vulnerable to "anything to do with China," seduced by the notion that a billion Chinese would be suddenly among the world's consumers. And indeed, "there are billions of Chinese ready to buy something," Mr. Dreman says, "it's just that they don't have any money."
 * Mutual fund surprises. For years, the hard work for mutual fund managers has been finding something to buy. But do they have what it takes to choose what and when to sell? Don Phillips of Morningstar Inc., which evaluates funds' performance, says fund managers will learn lots about selling in 1995 --particularly the selling of securities in bond and emerging markets funds that have already suffered heavy losses.
 And when they do sell, they could lose more than expected because of the glitches in the "matrix pricing" of the securities held in funds. Matrix pricing is the use of computer models to put a price on securities that do not trade very much, allowing funds to set a dollar value at the end of each day's trading. But those prices are "a best-guess estimate," Mr. Phillips adds, and 1995 may be an ugly test of the "guesstimates." If the estimates have been too high, the losses will be an unhappy surprise.
 * Stock churning. Investors have caught on to the pitfalls of limited partnerships. They're even getting wise to the game of mutual fund churning --taking clients in and out of funds and collecting a fat but largely hidden commission with each transaction. But, perhaps, they have already forgotten the lessons of old-fashioned stock churning, in which brokers buy and sell at rapid speed to drum up commissions.
 "I'm seeing more flat-out stock-churning cases," says Brian Smiley of Page & Bacek, an Atlanta law firm that represents small investors. "Now that it's not too fashionable to take a large commission bite at one time with one exotic investment, investors are getting nibbled to death with lots of little transactions."
 * Fee scams. As expectations for stock market returns get lower, investors are hearing a pitch to pay for aggressive money management rather than buy and hold, Mr. Phillips says. That increasingly means wooing investors into wrap accounts, in which investors typically pay fees of 2 percent of their assets each year to have someone move their money among individual stocks and bonds and mutual funds.
 Mr. Phillips is concerned that investors will wind up paying double fees --as much as 2 percent to the management of the fund, and another 2 percent for the wrap account guru who decides which funds to buy and sell. Considering that even optimists are making predictions of 6 percent annual gains for the stock market, the money managers had better select brilliantly or investors will barely break even.
 But investors are falling for it, says Mr. Smiley, the lawyer, who recently attended a seminar pitching wrap accounts that used mutual funds. One manager there boasted that his impressive returns were accomplished with "no risk," recalls Mr. Smiley, who has his doubts about the claim. Others in the audience were less cynical. "At the end, a woman raised her hand and said she wanted to express her appreciation for the wonderful, clear presentation," Mr. Smiley says. "I thought to myself, 'I wonder if I'll be seeing her in my office in the next couple years.' "

HEADLINE: In Newark, Prologue to an Arts Center

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
IT is known officially as the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. And the first building, now under construction in downtown Newark, is indeed that. But considering the long-range plans, it might as well be called the New Jersey Office, Shopping, Dining and Performing Arts Center.
 Ultimately, less than one-third of the floor area to be built on the site, or about 400,000 square feet, would be devoted to performances or subsidiary commercial uses. The rest of the space, 1 million square feet, would be in two large office towers across Center Street, on land controlled by the arts center. 
Doesn't Lincoln Center wish it owned all that land across Broadway?" asked Lawrence P. Goldman, president and chief executive of the center. "We're trying to own all our land, except our Broadway is called Center Street."
 "Why should private real estate developers be the sole beneficiaries?" he said. "We're trying to build in, from the beginning, the ability of a nonprofit institution to capitalize on the benefits that its creation brings to the area."
 Mr. Goldman knows something about the subject, since he was an executive at Carnegie Hall in the 1980's when it leased an adjacent parcel on 57th Street to the Rockrose Development Corporation, which built the 60-story Carnegie Hall Tower.
 Although the first building of the Newark center is scheduled to open in the 1996-97 season, it will take many more years -- perhaps decades -- before the social and economic transformation of the surrounding area is fully felt. So no one expects construction to begin anytime soon on the office towers. Their groundbreaking may not even happen in this century.
 But just the sight of two gangly red-and-white construction cranes towering high over the bare sycamores in Military Park has encouraged landlords nearby to believe that downtown Newark's slow revitalization will stay on track.
 Already, the 105-foot-high stage house of the multipurpose Great Hall has taken skeletal steel form, with the 40-by-60-foot proscenium plainly visible. One day, 2,750 seats will face this stage, on which the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, among other performers, is to play. Alongside the main auditorium is to be the 500-seat Victoria Theater, which has begun to rise over Park Place. The main lobby will be flanked on the west by a rotunda and on the east by a pavilion with two restaurants and a hall that can be used for rehearsals or banquets.
 "Military Park, with the construction of the performing arts center, will once again become a mecca of entertainment and nightlife in the state of New Jersey," said Miles P. Berger, chairman of the Berger Organization, which owns several buildings around the park, including 10 Park Place, a backdrop for almost every photograph taken of the arts center.
 The Bellemead Development Corporation is "very excited" about the arts complex, said James S. Servidea, a vice president. Bellemead built One Newark Center, a 22-story tower on Raymond Boulevard, two blocks from the new hall.
 "Here you have an area that's already started to rebound, but a lot of people don't know it yet," Mr. Servidea said. "The first step of getting them there is the difficult thing. The arts center will bring people down there to see what's happened who would not otherwise go. In terms of timing, I'm guessing 1997 or 1998 before it starts to have an impact."
The estimated cost for the first phase of the arts center is $150 million, including about $87 million for the first building, which has 230,000 square feet and will probably open in the spring of 1997. The Great Hall, whose capacity is 50 seats shy of Carnegie Hall's, would be used by a variety of companies, although only the orchestra has a contract now. The smaller Victoria Theater will be used for plays and recitals.
 ALMOST half the money, $62.5 million, comes from the state of New Jersey, with $33 million from private donors, $10 million from the city of Newark, $1.2 million from the Federal Government and $1 million from the state Arts Council. The balance, about $42 million, has not yet been raised.
 Barton Myers Associates of Los Angeles are the architects, with Wilson Woodridge Associates of East Orange, N.J., Jules Fisher/Joshua Dachs Associates of Manhattan, and Benjamin Thompson & Associates of Cambridge, Mass. The acoustician is Russell Johnson of Artec Consultants in Manhattan. The construction manager is Turner Construction Company of Somerset, N.J.
 There were three key design criteria, Mr. Goldman said: "Exciting esthetics, superb acoustics and revenue production from as many spaces as we could think of."
 The building is to have a 200-seat cafe and a fancier 100-seat restaurant, above which will be a 3,000-square-foot rehearsal space that can also be used as a banquet hall. There will be a gift shop, too, and the main lobby is to be rented for special events.
 The second phase of the project, between the first building and the McCarter Highway, closer to the Passaic River, is still tenuous. It is to be a concert hall with approximately 2,400 seats and about 200,000 square feet of space. There is no way yet to estimate its cost, Mr. Goldman said.
 It is difficult to predict the future, given the practical and political hurdles than can arise. For example, Mr. Goldman said, the "biggest negative surprise" to date was the discovery that the 1,100-space garage under Military Park was badly deteriorated.
 More recently, the United States Attorney's office has been investigating Mayor Sharpe James, whom Mr. Goldman calls "one of the great heroes" of the center, "an extremely powerful and articulate advocate in Newark, Trenton and Washington."
 Among other things, Federal authorities are examining what happened to money raised by the Sharpe James Civic Association from those who do business with the city, although Mr. James has not been charged with wrongdoing. Mr. Goldman had no comment on how the Mayor's difficulties might affect progress at the center.
 There have been many changes in the project since it was announced in 1987 by Gov. Thomas H. Kean. At that time, the center was to have five buildings on a six-block site west of Broad Street.
 The location was later moved to the east side of the park, close to the Passaic River. The New Jersey Economic Development Authority began acquiring the 14 parcels that compose the 11-acre site in December 1991. All but two contracts have now closed, said Jerry Enis, a spokesman for the arts center. The remaining parcels are owned by the state Transportation Department and the Archdiocese of Newark.
 (The chancery of the archdiocese is still in a handsome little Romanesque Revival building at 31 Mulberry Street but is to move next spring to a new archdiocesan headquarters designed by Michael Graves, at Clifton and Park Avenues, across from Sacred Heart Cathedral. The Mount Carmel Guild Multi-Service Center, which is also on the site, is moving into a renovated structure at 1160 Raymond Boulevard.)
 The Economic Development Authority paid the acquisition costs, about $20 million, with the sale of bonds. It leases the property to the state, which pays an annual rent of about $2 million. The state subleases it in turn to the arts center for $1 a year.
 Originally, there were to have been four cultural buildings in the complex, arrayed around a central plaza, not unlike Lincoln Center. That idea was abandoned four years ago, Mr. Goldman said, when the planners decided it was unlikely that the money needed for such an ambitious project could be raised in any reasonable period of time.
 Moreover, they felt, the center would be missing the opportunity to capitalize on its own real estate. Mr. Goldman, who was a vice president of Carnegie Hall, came to Newark convinced that nonprofit cultural institutions could profit from participating in adjoining development projects.
 Two parcels, on either side of the realigned Mulberry Street, have been set aside for 500,000-square-foot office and retail buildings. The sites would be leased to private developers, with the ground rent going to the arts center, which would also review the design of the buildings. The center might even take a share of the rents from tenants, as at Carnegie Hall.
 "Obviously," Mr. Goldman said, "the conditions in the central business district in Newark in the 90's are not the same as the West Side of Manhattan in the 80's, so who knows where the bargaining chips will fall."
 THE arts center is part of a larger 18-acre urban renewal area that includes vacant property along the Passaic River owned by the Newark Housing Authority. The renewal plan describes this as a potential site for a mixed-use development that would complement and enhance the arts center.
 Mr. Berger said the towers on Center Street might be under way by the year 2000. It is a "credible" project, he said, given the recent construction of One Newark Center, the Hartz Towers at Penn Station and the Legal Center, also near Penn Station.
 The Berger Organization owns several key properties around the arts center. Ten Park Place, a 10-story building constructed in 1916 for the Firemen's Insurance Company, was renovated in 1989. Mr. Berger said it is now fully occupied. The 15-story Robert Treat Center, 50 Park Place, was built in 1916 as the Robert Treat Hotel. It now has about 100,000 square feet of office space and is 96 percent occupied, Mr. Berger said.
 His next big project is an attempt to resuscitate the former Hahne & Company department store, a massive red-brick structure at 609 Broad Street. Each of its four floors covers nearly two acres. Given up by Hahne's in 1987, the 93-year-old building was bought in 1993 for $2.5 million. In 1994, Mr. Berger also acquired 605 Broad Street, an empty 17-story building -- with a 200-seat recital hall -- built in 1927 for the Griffith Piano Company.
 At Hahne's, he envisions a shopping mall around an atrium on the first floor and possibly the second. Above that would be offices and, perhaps, loft space for set designers or costume designers. But he is not pinning all his hope on the center.
 "The retailers who will entertain the possibility of leasing space here are probably closer to 14th Street than 57th Street," Mr. Berger said. "We can never lose sight of reality. It's very difficult to attract a suburban, affluent crowd to Newark, either for shopping in the daytime or for nightlife."
 "A retailer will not be able to rely on the promise of an arts center to open a store," he said. "A drug store is not going to rely on an arts center. A shoe store is not going to rely on an arts center."

HEADLINE: A New Year's Forecast for the Economy

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
IT is the new year, but with it come some old anxieties. Responses from several Westchester business leaders indicate that they are concerned about things like rising interest rates, government regulations and the cost of doing business in the months to come.
Q. What major obstacle do you believe will affect the economic recovery of Westchester in 1995? 
 P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors:
The residential real estate market has been one of the strongest pillars of Westchester's economic recovery since the 1990 recession. The number and dollar volume of sales of houses, condominiums and cooperatives reached an all-time high in 1994.
We may look forward to another strong year for real estate in 1995 if mortgage interest rates remain at manageable levels. The relatively low rates to date have enabled many first-time home buyers to afford typical Westchester housing prices. The low rates have also helped New York City co-op owners sell their units to first-time buyers and to move up and out to Westchester properties.
However, a significant jump in interest rates could lock first-time buyers out of the housing market here and everywhere. For example, just a 1 percentage point increase on a conventional, 30-year $100,000 mortgage results in added expense of about $70 monthly -- a sum that can be a deal breaker for many purchasers.
Unfortunately, we in Westchester don't control interest rates. They depend on national economic conditions, overall rate of inflation and Federal monetary policy interventions. Our best hope for 1995 is for steady, national noninflationary growth in the national economy.
Lawrence E. Dwyer Jr., president, the Westchester County Association:
I believe the major challenge facing Westchester business and therefore businesses throughout New York State in 1995 is the need for the state to demonstrate its desire to be aggressively hospitable to business. This statewide hospitality must focus on the attraction, retention and expansion of businesses.
For this to be accomplished, the first necessary step is the need to re-engineer and to effectively "right size" all government and the delivery of services. Restructuring will permit us to deliver services in a more cost-efficient, effective and people-minded manner.
An assertive leadership of partnership is necessary to respond to comprehensive needs and to set a vision of accomplishment that will create confidence in a realistic multiyear program. Westchester's future growth is dependent upon the stabilization of businesses of all sizes and by creating programs for the expanded training-retraining of our skilled work force for employment opportunities into the 21st century.
Our future must include structural change where the participants are willing to compromise in order to reach the goals of cost effectiveness and excellence for the overall good of Westchester.
Ross J. Pepe, president, Construction Industry Council of Westchester and Hudson Valley:
Interest rates! Interest rates! Interest rates! There is no other factor on the immediate horizon that could harm the industry's resurging private work sector more than the alarming climb in rates. Loan rates, equipment financing and contractor carrying costs are now at acceptable levels. If the Fed continues to hike rates, developers, builders, construction contractors and suppliers will be less inclined to take on new debt and finance new ventures.
Viewed from another perspective, after years of listless activity, the private construction market is finally showing signs of recovery. Building permits and housing starts are up in the last quarter, and the employment picture is improving. We're hoping this trend, which began in the second half of 1994, will carry through the new year.
But as we all know, nothing throws a damper on the housing market and new-venture incentive faster than the fear of higher interest rates.
But because the public work sector -- the heavy and highway segment of the industry -- still has two more solid years of funding from Federal and state sources, plans to repair and upgrade state roads, bridges, tunnels and commuter rail systems should not be in jeopardy at this time.
However, in their desire to cut Federal spending, we certainly hope policymakers don't hack away at the industry's mainstay of work, namely the state Department of Transportation's Research and Development and engineering staff and capital improvements to transportation. Surely, lawmakers must know that construction and well-maintained public works are the lifeblood of the economy.
Harold E. Vogt, president and chief executive officer of the Westchester County Chamber of Commerce:
Many are characterizing the outlook for the national economy as "recovery with muscle" with plenty of steam left to carry expansion well into 1995. That's nationally, and if the assessment is accurate, what does it mean for Westchester?
I believe it will mean little unless we can come to grips with the one thing that continues to impact the county's economy: that is the cost of doing business.
The cost of doing business is both a perception and a reality. As a perception, it stems from the absence of visible action to relieve the cost burden imposed by our county and municipal governments and school districts. It's the apparent lack of will to change, to re-engineer both the scope and function of our governments. It's the apparent attitude of our elected and school officials that the only way to change is to retain what is and add even more resources to meet current needs. To them, somehow more becomes less.
The reality is increased property taxes, costly regulatory actions like the Employee Commute Option program and increases in fees. These add to the actual cost of doing business and make Westchester uncompetitive for both expansion of existing businesses and attracting new business investments.
There are signs of change in Washington and Albany. Elected officials here in Westchester must follow suit. The coming year is their defining moment.
Michael Bisceglia, chairman of the Building Contractors Association of Westchester and the Mid-Hudson Region:
The billion-dollar construction industry in Westchester and Putnam Counties is sluggishly recovering from the depths of a three-year recession. Some contractors are cautiously optimistic about the future, but unless progress is made to reduce construction costs the recovery will abort.
In order to achieve this, we need regulatory reform, fiscal reform and a handle on the cost of labor.
Private-sector expansion is directly dependent on competitive and reasonable state and local tax and spending levels. We need clarification in several areas such as bidding requirements and contract terms. The proper management of contractor risk is also an important factor.
It should be remembered that each dollar spent in construction investment generates an additional $2.50 in relative economic activity. A healthy building and construction industry is the single most important component in revitalizing the region and state.
Carl Dimaio, president of the Builders Institute of Westchester and the Mid-Hudson Region:
The overriding obstacle to growth and development in Westchester and Putnam Counties is the proposal by New York City to place severe restrictions on building in the 2,000 square miles of land north and west of the city.
These regulations were taken from the land-use and zoning authority of local government and transferred to the city's bureaucracy, affecting the jobs of thousands of workers and the ability of local communities to generate taxable income for schools and municipal services.
If the plan is implemented, we estimate the loss of $3 billion in new construction in the watershed areas over the next four years.
At the heart of the issue is the city's attempt to avoid the building of water-filtration plants by substituting stringent land-use controls, although virtually every major city in the United States filters its water.
Our housing and general building industry is conducting an aggressive campaign to protect the watershed through the building of filtration plants and for the continuation of regulations administered by local health departments and local governments.
Saul Gluckman, chairman, Apartment Owners Advisory Council of Suburban New York, serving Westchester, Putnam and Hudson Valley:
Unless three major changes in the Emergency Tenant Protection Act are achieved in 1995-96, the rental-apartment industry may be damaged beyond repair. There are over 20,000 rental units in 18 municipalities in the county with a concentration in the larger cities. Controls have been in effect for over 50 years.
Spiraling costs, coupled with very low allowable rents, have taken their toll on building maintenance, and owners are hard pressed to proceed with anything more than what is required by building codes and other regulations.
To preserve our dwindling housing stock, we believe that reforms such as vacancy decontrol must be adopted and that rent increases should be allowed when major capital improvements are made to a building.
If these reforms take place, we will have largely offset the detrimental effects of rent regulation in terms of the maintenance and improvement of rental buildings, thereby preserving our dwindling rental-housing stock in the county.

HEADLINE: The Good, the Bad and the Uncertain

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
ECONOMIC indicators looked good -- but not that good -- for Westchester in 1994, with analysts saying that despite some gains, the county continued to lag behind the rest of the state and the nation.
The county's future is also problematic, and Frank M. Surdey, a regional economist for the State Department of Labor, said, "There are still some gray clouds on the horizon." 
 Mr. Surdey said that expressions of optimism from some quarters notwithstanding, the county has not rebounded from the recession -- although it is poised to turn the corner this year.
Layoffs continued at many of the county's largest employers -- and more are expected. The county's largest employer, International Business Machines, which employed 15,000 workers in the Hudson Valley in 1986, had only 7,300 in 1994. Reader's Digest in Pleasantville closed the year with 250 fewer jobs, down from 1,800 a year ago. And many smaller companies were following suit in an effort to streamline operations.
The job picture is not likely to brighten in the immediate future, Mr. Surdey said. General Motors, the country's largest automaker, is scheduled to close its North Tarrytown plant in 1996 -- which will mean a loss of 2,000 jobs. Macy's department store in White Plains is also planning to close, costing the county another 300 jobs. And Nynex, which has offices in White Plains, has announced that it is cutting its work force by 25 percent, although it is not known what that will mean in terms of job-loss numbers for Westchester.
Mr. Surdey said that last year Westchester grew at only one-ninth the pace of the rest of the country, judging by the economic indicators -- with the county growing at one-third the rate of the state and the state, in turn, growing at only one-third the rate of the rest of the United States.
On the plus side, economists were cheered by news in November that there were 1,000 new jobs in the county, the third consecutive month showing such an increase.
The latest numbers represented the best job growth the county has seen in three years. Some of the late-year growth was because of seasonal retail hiring, but most had to do with what Mr. Surdey called "real job growth" in the service sector, which includes engineering, accounting and management companies, health services and private educational and social services.
Noteworthy was an upswing in the number of manufacturing jobs to 44,200 in November, up by 4,000 over November 1993. That contrasted with the rest of the state, which saw a loss of 28,000 or 2.8 percent of its manufacturing jobs in November. Most of the growth in manufacturing jobs for Westchester was in fabricated metal products, electronic and electrical equipment and food products.
The jobless figure for November was 4.2 percent, the lowest for that time of year since 1992. But that figure could be misleading, Mr. Surdey said, because many discouraged workers -- former middle-management employees, among them -- have given up looking for jobs. Also, he said, some workers have left Westchester in search of better job prospects in other areas, a phenomenon the Department of Labor calls out-migration.
Noreen L. Preston, an economist with the county, said she was observing "a confluence of factors contributing to a turnaround" in Westchester. She cited an increase in commercial leasing -- especially a demand for light-industrial space -- and the announcement by Mastercard International that it would relocate its corporate headquarters to Purchase, on a former I.B.M. site, bringing 570 new jobs to the county.
Also, Ciba Corporation, a pharmaceutical and chemical company based in Basel, Switzerland, said in 1994 that it would keep its United States headquarters in Westchester. The concern, which had been considering a move to Connecticut, decided instead to maintain some of its space in Ardsley and also to lease offices in Tarrytown. The company employs 1,200 workers.
Geoffrey Thompson, a member of the Westchester Business Partnership, a public-private effort to promote the county, said office vacancy rates countywide dropped in 1994 to 22.3 percent, compared with nearly 27 percent in 1993.
Mr. Thompson, a partner in Thompson & Bender, a public relations and advertising firm in Pleasantville, said it was the first time the vacancy rate had declined since 1990. About 1.14 million square feet of office space was absorbed in 1994, compared with 1993 when 1.25 million square feet was abandoned.
The vacancy rate in downtown White Plains, one of the highest in the country, dropped to 30 percent from 35 percent in 1993.
"We have staunched the bleeding, stopped the hemorrhaging," Mr. Thompson said.
Despite the positive signs, Westchester continues to lag behind Fairfield County, both in terms of job growth and leasing activity, according to a report from the Rostenberg-Doern Company, a commercial realtor with offices in Stamford and Purchase.
During 1994, Fairfield saw its first office-construction activity -- 416,000 square feet -- since 1990. In Westchester, however, there was none. Yet economists said they were optimistic that as available space continued to be absorbed in Westchester, new construction would begin.
Looking ahead, Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx is renovating a former NCR building in Greenburgh for an adult day-care center and will hire 200 people.
Nordstrom's department store will open in White Plains at a new mall in March, hiring 600 workers. The $260 million mall, called the Westchester, will include 150 stores, in all generating about 2,500 full- and part-time jobs.
Tiffany & Company, the jewelry concern, is consolidating its manufacturing operations from Pleasantville and Manhattan to Pelham, adding about 100 new jobs.
Also, the Miles Corporation, a manufacturer of medical equipment, agreed to remain in the county after it was given reductions in its power costs in an arrangement with Consolidated Edison and the town of Greenburgh, along with other concessions. The company said it plans this year to add 200 workers to its staff of 800.
As the commercial real estate market improved, so did residential sales. Nicholas R. Wolff, director of Century 21 Wolff in White Plains and a member of the Westchester County Board of Realtors, said the lowest interest rates in 20 years in early 1994 encouraged first-time home buyers. Many condominium owners traded up to first homes, and some of those who owned small houses purchased larger ones.
Third-quarter performance for 1994, when seasonally adjusted, was equivalent to a yearly sales rate of 6,930 units, which was 20 percent higher than in 1993, a Board of Realtors report said. The largest increase, 36.6 percent, was in sales of condominiums.
Meanwhile, median sale prices of Westchester homes, which had climbed by about 6 percent in the second quarter of the year, slipped back by about the same amount in the third quarter. The $288,000 median sale price of a single-family house was down $19,000 or 6.2 percent from 1993.
As 1994 wore on, however, the rise in interest rates put a damper on real estate activity. Savo Fries, president of Westchester Multiple Listing Service, said that an increase of even "a half-point or so" eliminates many buyers.
"This is especially hard on first-time buyers," he said, "and the effect is mostly felt in sales of the lower-priced properties that serve the first-time buyer market."
At the banking offices of Chase Manhattan, William H. Dickinson, a vice president, said that the volume of residential mortgages written in 1994 dropped 50 percent. Also, refinancing accounted for 75 percent of all mortgage business in 1993, compared with 1994 when it amounted to 20 percent.
John N. D'Agostino, business director for Citibank's community business division, said that it appeared that the Northeast as a whole, where housing prices traditionally are among the highest, was the first to see a growth in the 1980's and will be "the last to see a recovery."
"The economy here," he said, "is not as strong as everyone thinks it is."
Two trends indicate that customers, too, are taking a dim view of the economy, Mr. D'Agostino said. Depositors are saving more in personal accounts and paying down on their debts -- "squirreling money away now," he said, "because they are unsure about the future."
But Mr. Surdey at the State Labor Department said Westchester is well positioned to catch up and move ahead in the years ahead because companies seeking to relocate will likely find the county a desirable place to do business.
Westchester has a highly skilled employee base available for work because of layoffs from corporate downsizing, and it has commercial space available to accommodate expansion, he said.

CONDITIONS OF LIBERTY
Civil Society and Its Rivals.
By Ernest Gellner.
225 pp. New York:
Allen Lane/
The Penguin Press. $27.95. 
THE collapse of Communism in the old Soviet bloc revealed that in all its years Communism had done little to change the attitudes and aspirations of its victims; such desires as political freedom, national independence and the chance of prosperity for their children had been in cold storage, but were instantly revived. It also revealed that although Communist governments had been quite ineffective in creating a new Communist human nature and a new Communist society, they had been all too effective in undermining the habits and attitudes that a liberal democracy depends on.
It is this observation that provides Ernest Gellner's starting point in "Conditions of Liberty," a witty, elegant and sharply pointed essay on the prospects for liberal democracy in the late 20th century. The task of post-Communist society has often been described as that of building or rebuilding "civil society." Mr. Gellner's book is an account of what that means, what constitutes a "civil society" and what other ways of organizing social and economic life might have as much staying power as the capitalist, liberal, democratic mix that Europe and the United States have created over the last two centuries. Mr. Gellner -- for many years a professor of philosophy at the London School of Economics, later a professor of social anthropology at Cambridge University and now director of the Center for the Study of Nationalism at the Central European University in Prague -- also asks what chance there is of other societies' creating that mixture deliberately, and how attractive we can expect the ideal to be in societies not already attached to liberal, democratic and capitalist values.
People who have read any of Mr. Gellner's many other works will know to expect a dazzling high-speed tour of the largest issues in sociology and political theory. "Conditions of Liberty" is crammed with historical, anthropological and philosophical arguments in which the religious attachments of the Berbers compete for our attention with the 18th-century Scottish Enlightenment, and the iniquities of Stalin with the insights of the philosopher Sir Karl Popper. Not every argument is convincing, but there is never a dull moment.
What is civil society? That is an oddly difficult question. As Mr. Gellner observes, until the slow decline of Communism during the 1970's and 80's, the expression was not much heard: "A person interested in the notion of Civil Society could be assumed to be a historian of ideas, concerned perhaps with Locke or Hegel. But the phrase itself had no living resonance or evocativeness. Rather, it seemed distinctly covered with dust." It is clear that civil society was something the West had and the Communist regimes had crushed or stifled. More positively, civil society meant the social and economic arrangements that counterbalanced the power of the state by providing an alternative source of power and prestige to the state itself.
BUT in order to form civil society, these arrangements must have a particular character. As Mr. Gellner points out, there are many societies in which other institutions exist apart from the state and as a restraint on it. One is what anthropologists call a segmentary society; in such societies families have far-reaching authority over their members, and the state has little authority over the families. Such societies are pluralist, but they suffer from an obvious defect -- in our eyes -- which is that they are stifling. Their inhabitants may be unbothered by the government, but they are continuously under the eye of their cousins.
What we are after, Mr. Gellner says, can only be defined as pluralism "of a certain kind" -- a pluralism that is secular, individualistic, built on capitalist economic relations and scientifically minded rather than superstitious or given to magical thinking. That is what Max Weber thought Western Europe had built on the basis of the Protestant Reformation. That creation was paradoxical because Protestantism had been anything but tolerant, secular, easygoing and worldly in its origins. Nonetheless, it turned out to be the ideal device for reducing the power of the priesthood, breeding intellectual independence and instituting an individualism highly favorable to economic growth.
The fact that civil society was thus the unexpected gift of several centuries of religious upheaval and frequently unwanted economic and technological change raises some old and famous questions. Given that liberalism, capitalism and democracy took root in Western Europe, and later in those parts of the world to which British colonialism exported it, what are their prospects elsewhere? And if those prospects are not altogether bright, how much does it matter? Are there other satisfactory ways of being a modern society, ways that would not suit North Atlantic "us" but might suit East Asian or Middle Eastern or post-Communist "them"? If there are, is coexistence possible between the inhabitants of a civil society and the inhabitants of whatever other sorts of society can survive in the modern world?
THIS is Mr. Gellner's territory; as an anthropologist he has spent his life puzzling over the conditions of modernization, and as a philosopher he has always celebrated the rise of what Karl Popper called "the open society." The philosopher and the anthropologist have coexisted in some tension, however, since Mr. Gellner has combined an unswerving defense of the moral, political and intellectual superiority of the liberal, pluralist, scientifically oriented modern world with an equally unswerving readiness to believe that many of its rivals are perfectly viable. Indeed, a good deal of "The Condition of Liberty" is devoted to a wry examination of the strange fact that Communist Eastern Europe was one of the unusual cases where a social system just imploded.
Mr. Gellner does not wish to suggest that civil society is the inevitable gift of capitalism and industri alization. Japan has effectively combined a feudal social order with striking economic success; Singapore has no wish to emulate the United States, as its spokesmen frequently remind us. Islam may or may not prove to be compatible with economic progress when the oil runs out, but thus far religious radicalism flourishes in many countries while secular radicalism fades.
Is this alarming? Mr. Gellner thinks not. It is hard on the societies of the former Soviet bloc, with which the discussion started, that they can neither expect to create a civil society by wishing for it nor find themselves creating it in the process of rebuilding their
economies. But on the international scene, we have not much to fear. In his view, the vast preponderance of economic and military power lies with societies attached to the ideals of a civil society. He concludes: "They can live with the polities which do not share the spirit of Civil Society, as long as they themselves retain that dominance and minimal cohesion, and as long as the most recent cohort of effective industrializers continues to be interested in wealth and not much else."
Whether those conditions can be expected to apply forever is another matter entirely, and one on which Mr. Gellner does not speculate. Some readers may wish that he had placed a bet on the outcome of the competition between American chaos and Singaporean order. Most will be content to have such a friendly guide to the nature of the competition, and will at any rate end "Conditions of Liberty" better able to make up their own minds.

HEADLINE: Drug Turf Is Safer as Dealers Avoid Streets

SERIES: When Crime Recedes: Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
When Danny Cabero returned recently from two years in prison for drug possession he hardly recognized his old turf in Washington Heights, where streets were once congested with young men hawking drugs to drive-by addicts, and guns and knives were preferred means of communication.
"It's quiet," said Mr. Cabero, 20, who went back this spring to the northern Manhattan neighborhood that became a landmark in the nation's cocaine crisis. "They have less people selling drugs in the street. Less people robbing. One thing you can say about Washington Heights: you can walk down the street here and be safe." 
 Although there is no evidence that the drug trade has diminished significantly, it has become less violent. With the sharp decline in the city's crime rate, Washington Heights offers evidence that the deadly edge of the drug business has dulled, at least momentarily, with police strategies more effective and some turf wars between dealers now settled.
In 1991, when those wars were raging, 119 people were killed in Washington Heights; last year the number fell to 56. Shootings dropped by a quarter from 1993 to 1994. And possibly as a result of an increased police presence in the neighborhood, reports of other crimes, like auto theft and grand larceny, fell significantly last year.
With legions of former drug sellers now consigned to either cells or coffins, both the police and residents say there are fewer new recruits taking their places on the streets.
Everyone has his own barometer for the drop in crime. The Rev. Earl Kooperkamp of the Church of the Intercession, at 155th Street and Broadway, says he is rarely harassed by drug dealers now. "It used to be constant," he said. "When I was driving around making parish visits -- a white guy in a Jeep -- it was constant soliciting: 'Hey, Popi. What do you want? What do you want?' "
While new programs in Washington Heights are offering youths alternatives to the street and more tenant groups are fighting drugs in their buildings, the biggest changes in crime appear linked to police efforts and changes in the drug trade.
These days, the police see more organization and sophistication among dealers, whose operations have been forced from the streets into apartment buildings by years of enforcement pressure. Narcotics officers say knots of street dealers have been replaced by a handful of "steerers" on the sidewalk, directing customers to apartments outfitted as sales offices. The men on the street use electronic buzzers and walkie-talkies to warn those inside about the nearby police.
Many of the apartments are furnished with nothing more than a desk or two, scales for weighing drugs and nearly invisible custom-made compartments for hiding contraband. When officers raided an apartment on 190th Street recently, they made five arrests and seized 25 pounds of cocaine and two guns. But what surprised them most was the network of video cameras trained on the street to spot police activity.
Many drug dealers now use one apartment for transactions and others, blocks away, to stash larger amounts of drugs and money. And the police say cars are being customized so that the push of a hidden button opens a secret compartment in the dashboard.
"It's more secretive and better hidden now," said Richard Wells, a police officer in Washington Heights for the last four years. "It was so blatant before."
The crack explosion of the mid-1980's transformed the side streets of Washington Heights into wholesale cocaine supermarkets minutes from New Jersey, Westchester County and other parts of the city. In July 1986, in an undercover political event to show how open the selling had become, Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the United States Attorney in Manhattan, put on a leather vest and sunglasses, and together with Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who wore a windbreaker and Army cap, bought crack as part of a buy-and-bust operation on 160th Street.
The market overwhelmed both the police and the new Dominican population, which had grown in Washington Heights since the mid-1970's.
Washington Heights, with a population of about 300,000, remains one of the most dangerous parts of the city and is still a favored destination for cocaine buyers. The police also say heroin -- which preceded cocaine as the main drug available in the neighborhood -- is now being sold with increasing frequency.
But much is different. The number of police officers has increased to 445 from 338 in the last two years. The police precinct itself has been split in two, creating a second station house for the neighborhood.
Community policing programs, expanded under the Dinkins administration, have more officers walking beats. And new powers granted to street officers by the Giuliani administration allow them to investigate and arrest drug sellers, augmenting the department's narcotics division, which previously handled most drug investigations. Through mid-December, the police made more than 2,800 drug arrests in Washington Heights in 1994, nearly 35 percent more than in 1993.
"A couple of years ago, we'd see these guys in the street; we knew they were drug dealers, but we'd just pass them by," said Dennis Rodriguez, an officer who has patrolled some of the most drug-infested streets of Washington Heights. "Maybe we would just tell them to move on. But when you went off the block, they came back. We were handcuffed."
The department has tried a variety of other strategies, including seizing the cars of buyers who travel across the George Washington Bridge and from other areas to make their purchases. And although the volume of the drug business cannot be measured, both the police and residents say it has slowed slightly.
The crackdown has pushed some drug activity south to Harlem, and some New York drug dealers have moved to less competitive markets upstate and in other East Coast cities, say both the police and others familiar with the drug business.
The trade still comprises mostly small operations, each run by fewer than a dozen people, the police say. The difference now is that is that fewer of these operations exist. "On one block you could have three or four major players," Mr. Rodriguez said. "Five years ago on these blocks you could hardly get down the street, there were so many guys. And there were shootouts all the time because of the competition."
Police officials say those battles -- which drew police attention and hurt the drug business -- have been quelled to some degree by understandings between dealers about who controls which areas.
"It's like the Mafia," said John Coyne, a lieutenant in the 33d Precinct in the lower half of Washington Heights. "You go back 50 or 60 years and they were killing each other right and left, but you put someone in charge, and they know the rules and they don't kill each other as much."
To community leaders, the reduction in crime also reflects an evolution of the immigrant community, which has increased its political power and expanded organizations to combat a host of ills, from apartment overcrowding to the high rate of school dropouts.
"It's the normal growth and development of the community," said Victor Morisete, the executive director of the Community Association of Progressive Dominicans. "When you have a stake in where you live, you will think differently, you will treat that area differently, and crime is one of the things that is affected."
A turning point for the neighborhood was five days of disturbances in July 1990 ignited by the killing of Jose (Kiko) Garcia, a drug suspect, by Officer Michael O'Keefe during a scuffle. Although the officer was cleared of any wrongdoing, the killing raised the suspicions of many residents that the police were abusive and corrupt.
At the time, crime seemed boundless, and the influx of young immigrants had overwhelmed the already-crowded schools. Many had turned to the drug trade.
"I felt that perhaps we were threatened in a way we never were before," said Guillermo Linares, who in 1991 became the first Dominican immigrant elected to the City Council. "It was overwhelming to see people standing on the street and knowing that there is something going on that is not right and that the only way to confront it is if the whole community comes together to confront it."
The disturbances, with overturned cars aflame and the police under attack from flying rocks and bottles, opened a pressure valve in Washington Heights. Since then, residents' requests for more officers have been answered, and community and police officials have tried to erase stereotypes of all cops as corrupt thugs and all young immigrants as gun-packing drug dealers.
The redoubled focus on Washington Height's youths can be seen daily behind the battered brown doors of P.S. 143, where an after-school program of athletics, academics and crafts attracts hundreds of young people, from pre-teen students to former convicts wearing gang beads.
"This becomes like a surrogate home for these kids," said Eddie Silverio, a program director.
At the school on a recent night, Mr. Silverio asked Mr. Cabero about the 10 closest friends he had before he went to prison. "Those 10 people," Mr. Cabero said, "are now behind the walls of Sing Sing, Attica . . . "
Mr. Silverio motioned to another man in the room that night. Milton Martinez, 28, who described himself as the leader of the Netas gang in Washington Heights, is a former drug dealer who has served sentences for robbery and attempted murder. Released this fall, he swears he is a changed man.
Mr. Silviero said reducing crime permanently may require more than just putting people in prison and putting more police officers on the street, especially in neighborhoods where the economy is fragile and money for youth programs is scarce.
"There are no jobs," Mr. Silverio said. "What's Milton going to do to survive?"

Charts: "BEHIND THE NUMBERS: Crime Patterns in the Boroughs"
 Although crime has been a major concern of many New Yorkers, the actual rate of crimes reported to the police has risen and fallen several times in the last decade or so. Crime reached a low point in 1985 but climbed steadily through 1990 as the crack epidemic brought a wave of lawlessness to neighborhoods throughout the city. Since then crime has fallen steeply. But the changes have not affected all neighborhoods equally. JOSH BARBANEL
 
PERSONAL FELONIES
 Only in Manhattan have the numbers of felonies against people -- homicides, robberies and assaults -- fallen below the levels reported in 1985. In Staten Island and Queens, which have relatively low crime rates, the rates are far above the levels of the mid-1980's, 33 percent higher in Staten Island, 18 percent higher in Queens. And in all boroughs except Manhattan, the homicide rate is above the level reported in 1985, with Queens recording an increase of more than 40 percent through the decade.
 
PROPERTY FELONIES
 Crimes against property, like burglary and auto theft, are also down the most in Manhattan. Since 1985 burglaries have fallen by a third in Manhattan and by almost as much in Brooklyn. Auto thefts skyrocketed from 1985 to 1990, with Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn posting increases of greater than 90 percent. Since 1990, car thefts have declined, but by not nearly as much, and remain 20 percent higher than a decade before.

HEADLINE: WELFARE DEBATE WILL RE-EXAMINE OLD ASSUMPTIONS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
A great debate is about to begin over one of the major premises of America's social welfare policy: that low-income people are legally entitled to Government aid guaranteeing a minimum standard of living.
Many of the Republicans who will take control of Congress on Wednesday contend that welfare, Medicaid and food stamps should be stripped of their status as open-ended "entitlements." Instead, they say, Congress should appropriate fixed amounts of money each year for those programs, whose size would no longer increase automatically when, for example, a recession put more people out of work. 
 Neither Democrats nor Republicans are proposing significant changes in the largest entitlement program, Social Security, or withdrawing the entitlement status of Medicare, although the money spent on those two programs dwarfs the spending on welfare and food stamps.
Instead, the battle lines have been drawn over the use of entitlements to guarantee a minimum standard of living for the poor. That struggle transcends the debate over specific Republican proposals that would, for example, increase the use of orphanages, impose stringent work requirements on welfare recipients and eliminate aid to the children of young unmarried women.
Here is the outlook:
*The Clinton Administration is reassessing the whole question of entitlements, is receptive to some changes and has not decided on a strategy for dealing with Republican proposals to restructure welfare.
*Nonpartisan experts believe that Congress may, for the first time, limit Federal Medicaid spending, which has doubled in four years, reaching $82 billion in 1994. Medicaid provides health care for 33 million low-income people; Medicare finances health care for 36 million people who are elderly or disabled.
*Congress will consider giving states a lump-sum payment, or block grant, to help poor people now entitled to benefits under the main cash welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Block grants would be a radical departure because they would eliminate individual entitlement to benefits and would give states more flexibility in deciding how to use the money.
*The food stamp program is perhaps the most secure of the major programs for poor people. House Republicans want to put it into a block grant with other food and nutrition programs, but they expect resistance because food stamps have support from a middle-class constituency that includes farmers, grocers and the food industry generally.
The struggle will challenge Democrats, in the Administration and in Congress, to explain why entitlement programs were created and why they should be continued.
Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican on the Budget Committee, said: "We have to get these programs off autopilot. They should be subject to annual appropriations. Entitlements have taken away the power of the people, through Congress, to decide where money is spent each year." Congress would need more control over spending to comply with a proposed constitutional amendment that would require a balanced Federal budget, he said in an interview.
Democrats say the welfare and food stamp programs serve a valuable economic purpose, infusing money into a state when recession hits, unemployment rises and more families need assistance.
Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, a member of the Ways and Means Committee who is trying to coordinate the Democratic strategy on welfare legislation, said he strongly believed that states should have more flexibility in designing programs, but he worried about Republican efforts to replace entitlement programs. "What would happen in times of recession?" he asked in an interview. "You can't repeal economic cycles."
Another Democrat, Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said entitlement programs responded automatically to economic and demographic changes.
Mr. Shays countered, "That's a good argument, but in the process we're going bankrupt."
In an entitlement program, the Government has a legal obligation to pay benefits to all applicants who meet criteria set by Federal law. The formulas for deciding who gets how much stay the same from year to year unless Congress votes to change them. If the demand for aid exceeds expectations, Congress must somehow come up with more money, by borrowing, raising taxes or cutting other items in the budget.
By contrast, Congress appropriates specific amounts each year for discretionary spending programs, which include defense, medical research, law enforcement, Head Start and job training.
Entitlement programs account for slightly more than half of all Federal spending, roughly $800 billion of $1.5 trillion last year. The large middle-class entitlements, Social Security and Medicare, which pay benefits regardless of financial need, dwarf the programs for low-income people -- the Government spent $475 billion on Social Security and Medicare in 1994, compared with $125 billion on Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps and Medicaid. But Social Security, which both parties have found to be a volatile issue, is off the table, and Congress is not considering changing the entitlement status of Medicare.
The roots of these programs run deep. Welfare, under the name Aid to Dependent Children, was part of the Social Security Act in 1935. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Food Stamp Act in 1964. Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965.
While committed to the overall goals of those programs, the Clinton Administration has not decided whether or how to defend their status as entitlements. White House officials are mulling that question as they prepare for a conference on welfare with governors and members of Congress from both parties in the next few weeks.
Administration officials said President Clinton, a former governor, was sympathetic to the governors' pleas for more flexibility in using Federal money.
Asked if she would defend the entitlement status of welfare and Medicaid, Avis LaVelle, an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, said: "No, I can't. There is a re-evaluation going on throughout the department as to the whole concept of entitlement programs. It's just not smart for us to take an advocacy position one way or another. The ground is shifting under our feet."
Representative Levin said Democrats in Congress and the Administration had "no clear strategy" for dealing with the Republican proposals at this time. "It's important for us to develop one quickly," he said.
Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said that if lawmakers wanted to slow the growth of welfare programs, they could do so without eliminating the entitlement to benefits. For example, he said, Congress could restrict eligibility or make benefits less generous. Such changes could save substantial amounts of money, but the Government would still have a legal obligation to pay benefits to any applicants who met the criteria.
There is fierce competition for money among domestic programs, and it is likely to intensify this year. Current law imposes an annual limit on all discretionary spending through 1998, and President Clinton says he wants to maintain the ceiling at current levels in 1999 and 2000. Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the Republican in line to become chairman of the House Budget Committee, says he wants to reduce the spending limits.
If a benefit program loses its status as an entitlement, it would have to compete with all the other domestic programs for money. And that, many Republicans say, is exactly what should happen.

HEADLINE: Democrats Talk of Power on the Last Days With It

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 1

 BODY:
Like the dispirited troops of a defeated army, Democrats and Congressional staff members prepared to relinquish cherished posts and cluttered, file-filled cabinets on the eve of the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives. Lunch gatherings were grim, partings tearful and wishes for the new year filled with gallows humor.
At the Ford Annex building, Judi Greenwald introduced several colleagues as they were packing: "We're with the subcommittee on energy and power. At least we are until the end of the day." 
 The absolute, and at times absolutely capricious, exercise of power on Capitol Hill was a recurrent theme throughout that long goodbye. Each of those staff members had known for nearly a year that they would be unemployed come 1995, since Representative Philip R. Sharp, the Indiana Democrat for whom they all worked, chose not to run for re-election. But not one had expected to be part of a broader exodus.
"We knew a long time ago," Ms. Greenwald said. "We just didn't have any idea that we were going to be in a whole throng of people."
For Leon Lowery, the departure had great import. "Not only have you lost your personal job," he said, "but people are telling you that the whole ideology you represent has been rejected by America. Personally, professionally, emotionally -- any level you take -- it's pretty tough."
Shelley Fidler just grimaced. "Leon has been reading the Bible," she said. "Lamentations."
Mr. Lowery raised an eyebrow. "A lot of people don't believe in government," he said with a touch of devilish revenge. "But now they are going to have to run it."
Not everyone caught up in the change was so morose. While assorted Democrats fretted, feted and gnashed, Representative Newt Gingrich and his newly minted Republican majority were champing at the bit for power. Parties around the city were full of Republican revelers still toasting the November victory, while the newly anointed seemed as anxious as first-time suitors as they prepared to move into new offices.
Washington's permanent population was already figuring to profit from the shift. Among the first businesses to capitalize on the change has been that most ephemeral and yet most constant of Washington power bases: the trendy restaurants in which dining and doing business combine.
"Republicans eat, too," said Steven Damato, the owner of Nora's, a homey-trendy restaurant that is a favorite of President Clinton's family. Mr. Damato said the restaurant would be host to a Republican event on Tuesday, one night before the 104th Congress convenes.
And the future looks good, too. "Change is wonderful for business," Mr. Damato said. "The restaurants will be packed full of special interests."
Real estate agents were crowing as well, using the most potent of Washington put-offs to inform reporters that they were simply too busy to talk. Several moaned that they could not stay on the phone for more than a few minutes since their appointments with incoming power brokers were stacked like salmon jumping the rapids.
"There has been an awful lot of scurrying around," said a very rushed Mike Frias, an agent at John Forman Real Estate.
By most accounts, the new Washingtonians were settling as near as possible to ground zero, in the Victorian row houses and quaint apartments on the tree-lined but sometimes crime-infested streets near Capitol Hill.
It makes for a blissfully short commute and great public relations bites. "These folks come in extremely early, work late. If they have a break, they want to go home," Mr. Frias said.
But few have been buying properties. "New members are not interested in giving their constituency the impression that they are becoming entrenched," Mr. Frias said. Or else, just maybe, they have a clear and present sense of the fickleness of a disgruntled electorate.
Over in Federal buildings where unsuspecting professionals have been chopped out of politics in part of a general restructuring initiated by Mr. Gingrich, confusion and resentment mixed with a poignant sense of purpose.
"I guess I am looking for a job," said Dr. Raymond W. Smock, the recently out-of-work House historian, who had to inform his staff of five that they were also abruptly unemployed since the office was decreed closed by the incoming Speaker. "But, hey, I'm not complaining. Five thousand Amtrak employees are out of work. Nobody has any sympathy for anybody on the Hill who lost his job."
In Federal buildings on Capitol Hill this week, offices were exchanged and furniture dragged about in the traditional horse trading that comes with the flip-flop of minority and majority slots. Republicans moved into majority cubbyholes. Members of the former majority slipped down to minority digs, and some offices closed for good as part of the extensive restructuring.
It is hard, though, to quantify the scope of change just now. The House historian's office cannot say because data from the 104th Congress is not yet in. By the time the statistics emerge, the historian's office itself will be long gone.
Last week, even the House clerk's staff could not answer basic questions. Inquiries about staff changes, personnel cutbacks and committee clear-outs were referred to Mr. Gingrich's office with the advice: "Ask him. He's the guy with the power. He's only one who knows what's happening."
Longtime residents of Washington are used to all of this. The capital's equivalent of a stiff upper lip is a sense of denial. "We're used to this," said countless members of the newly unemployed. "It's politics."
Subsets of the city were already gearing up for an adrenaline rush, though. John Brademas, the chairman of the President's Committee on Arts and Humanities, girded for guerrilla warfare. A longtime Democratic Congressman from Indiana and a former president of New York University, he knows how to play politics.
After acknowledging that financing for the arts, education and humanities was a prominent Republican target for the cutting board, Mr. Brademas mentioned almost casually that most of the prominent board members of major opera companies, museums, theater groups were powerful Republicans with ample funds and huge political leverage.
"We're not quite sure what's going to happen yet," he said. "But savage reductions in these programs would mark a giant step backwards. And at least in my experience -- which stretches back to Eisenhower -- every government has come up with funds."
Fine and well for opera performers if that record holds. But the House historian, Dr. Smock, really was watching history pass by. Tapping his foot against a nondescript wooden crate last week, he mentioned that its contents were the private letters and papers of Speaker Joseph G. Cannon, whose rule ended in 1911.
"It doesn't look like something out of 'The Raiders of the Lost Ark,' " Dr. Smock said, creaking the crate open. "But, hey, it's the real thing."

HEADLINE: China Revamps Forces With Eye to Sea Claims

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 1

 BODY:
As Chinese diplomats talk of peaceful coexistence with their Southeast Asian neighbors, China's military leaders are refurbishing a portion of their large and antiquated military to enforce claims of sovereignty over the South China Sea and its resources, Chinese and Western experts say.
In this effort, Chinese military leaders have nurtured specific industries to develop advanced weapons technology and are tailoring their naval and air forces for the region, the experts say, even as the country's overall level of military production is declining. 
 At stake are potentially vast oil reserves, minerals and fishing grounds that intersect some of the world's busiest shipping lanes. With energy demands surging along with the population, oil supplies are falling behind in China, which in 1993 became a net importer of oil for the first time. So any major oil discovery in the South China Sea is likely to draw Beijing's immediate attention on securing it.
A group of former American military leaders who visited China last year has reported that China is forming a limited military force "capable of rapid response" and intended to protect "island claims in the South China Sea as a matter of national priority."
The group was led by former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara and four recently retired four-star military officers, including David E. Jeremiah, a former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and James P. McCarthy, a former deputy commander of United States forces in Europe.
Although comprehensive military modernization remains a distant goal for China, these and other experts say, Beijing has in recent years taken these steps to build up its military:
*Improved its ability to fight a sustained sea battle with its fleet of surface warships, support vessels and submarine forces.
*Negotiated with Russia to buy 72 advanced Su-27 attack aircraft capable of providing close air support for naval operations at extended range. (The first 24 Su-27s were delivered in 1992 but negotiations over the terms for the rest have been troublesome.)
*Organized a handful of marine units for amphibious assault and trained airborne forces for rapid deployment in Soviet-made transport aircraft. (One such force is based on Hainan Island for quick dispatch to the Spratlys and the Paracels, two island chains in the South China Sea.)
*Developed mobile, conventional-warhead missiles to threaten any foe within 1,000 miles.
"By the year 2005, they would like to achieve a core force of 500,000 to one million across their services who are fairly modern," said one specialist on Chinese military affairs.
Apart from the recent efforts, however, this goal seems illusive to other experts because China is still technologically unsophisticated in some areas.
Chinese warships, for example, have little or no effective air defense, and their targeting radars cannot reach over the horizon. China has no hope of financing aircraft-carrier development for at least a decade. Its submarines are noisy and vulnerable and are equipped with poorly functioning torpedoes.
The Chinese Air Force has yet to produce a modern, supersonic aircraft with all-weather air-to-air combat abilities. And China's air defense system could not stop penetration by the French Mirage 2000 attack planes recently purchased by Taiwan, whose pilots get more flight training hours in a month than Chinese pilots get in a year, experts say.
"We are aware that our weaponry of all services is far behind the present equipment of the United States," Adm. Liu Huaqing, China's top military officer, told the McNamara group. "We hope to modernize, but the problem is that we have no resources; and if we compete with economic needs, we will be in competition with the economy, and that is not in China's interest."
Still, Chinese and Western specialists say, Beijing's limited buildup is threatening to neighbors like Vietnam, which lost two vessels in a clash with Chinese forces in 1988.
"The danger of what we have on the question of China's military is that people are beginning to make the case that China is benign," said James R. Lilley, a former Ambassador to Beijing and longtime Central Intelligence Agency officer in Asia.
"China says it has no military objectives, that on the South China Sea it wants to cooperate to find a diplomatic solution while exploiting the resources, that there are no military solutions and that China is focusing on the economy," he said.
Arguing that by all appearances, China's military buildup is tightly focused on the South China Sea area, Mr. Lilley added: "I'm afraid the evidence tells us otherwise. And it is quite clear that that is their objective in 10 to 20 years."
Experts point out that Admiral Liu, a member of the ruling Politburo and former chief of the navy, has been a leading advocate for seizing the rich mineral and fishing grounds of the South China Sea to support China's swelling population. The diet of China's population, Admiral Liu once told the New China News Agency, will increasingly require the protein supplied from fish. As exploitation of sea-based resources becomes more important, he added, China will need a modern navy. Indeed, China's consumption of seafood has quadrupled since 1978.
In February 1992, the National People's Congress issued its "Law on the Territorial Waters and Their Contiguous Areas," which laid claim to 80 percent of the South China Sea with a horseshoe-shaped boundary that runs the length of Vietnam's coastline and then swings southwest to waters off Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines.
The law laid down regulations for transit through the area and called for "immediate eviction of foreign military vessels or vessels owned by foreign governments and used for noncommercial purposes that violate the laws and regulations" of China. Seventy percent of Japan's crude oil imports traverses the area.
Last month, the official Guangming Daily said 400 Chinese scholars recently completed 10 years of research on the Spratly Islands and "proved historically" that China "discovered and developed the Spratly Islands."
The Spratlys -- comprising 21 islands and atolls, 50 submerged land spits and 28 partly submerged bits of rock and reef spread out over 340,000 square miles -- "are a sacred and inviolable part of Chinese territory," the newspaper said.
The United States has never taken a position on the territorial disputes in the South China Sea, which also involve claims by Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia and Brunei. By far the most contentious dispute is between China and Vietnam, whose naval forces clashed most recently in 1988 when Chinese warships sank two Vietnamese vessels with the loss of more than 70 lives.
In 1990, Prime Minister Li Peng offered to put the sovereignty question aside and called for joint development of oil resources by all the claimants, but there were no takers.
In mid-1992, China contracted with a small American company, the Crestone Energy Corporation, to begin oil exploration off Vietnam's coast near Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnam replied last year by granting the Mobil Oil Corporation drilling rights in adjacent waters.
Diplomats in the region say China and Vietnam pledged in November to "refrain from all acts" that could "broaden conflicts" or lead to the use of force in the region. But a state visit to Hanoi by Chinese President Jiang Zemin did little to allay Vietnam's concern about China's long-term intentions.
While future use of military force by Beijing in the South China Sea is considered possible, Michael Swaine, an expert on the Chinese military at the Rand Corporation, argues that by occupying islands and drilling for oil, China has seized "a negotiating position" and may want to avoid further military conflict.

HEADLINE: A New President, and Brasilia Is Again a Capital of Hope

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Jan. 1

 BODY:
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a 63-year-old sociologist, was inaugurated as Brazil's President today, promising to give all his energy to banishing inflation from Latin America's largest nation.
"The majority of Brazilians made a clear choice" for low inflation and high growth, Mr. Cardoso said, referring to his landslide electoral victory in October. 
 Mr. Cardoso, the architect of Brazil's radically successful anti-inflation plan, also vowed in his inaugural address before Congress to further open Brazil to foreign investment and trade.
With "the opening of the Brazilian economy, we are leaving behind xenophobic attitudes," said Mr. Cardoso, whose government experience includes recent stints as Foreign Minister and Finance Minister.
"Today, there is no serious specialist who does not forecast for Brazil anything but a long period of growth," he said.
While 21-gun salutes and fighter jet flyovers noisily marked Mr. Cardoso's new role as Commander in Chief today, some recalled that he was once exiled and blacklisted for his opposition to Brazil's military rule, a period that lasted from 1964 to 1985.
"It's an irony I savor," a longtime friend of Mr. Cardoso, Peter D. Bell, recalled from New York. When Mr. Bell worked for the Ford Foundation in Rio de Janeiro in 1969, United States Embassy officials unsuccessfully pressured him to withhold funding for a study group Mr. Cardoso was forming. The American officials argued that Mr. Cardoso was a Communist and that he had no future in Brazil.
"Fernando Henrique's real crime was that he was a card-carrying democrat," said Mr. Bell, who is a chairman of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy group. "In the context of the military dictatorship, democrats were seen as upsetting the apple cart."
Twenty-five years later, Mr. Cardoso is a social democrat who enjoys heavy business support. Today, he appealed in his nationally televised speech, "Let us retire the old ideological dilemmas and the old forms of confrontation."
On a day of gray skies and intermittent rain, this young capital exuded optimism, recalling the days in the 1960's when it was called "the capital of hope."
"Exceptional flight conditions," Brazil's leading business magazine, Exame, said of Mr. Cardoso's prospects. "No President has ever started his mandate in such an auspicious situation."
In a survey released today by the Datafolha polling organization, 70 percent of respondents predicted that the Cardoso Government would be "good" or "great."
Unfazed by the dramatic devaluation of the Mexican peso over the last 10 days, many Brazilians believe that their country is embarking on an economic boom that will rival the miracle years of the early 1970's.
"Thanks to the success of the Real Plan and to the election of its author as President, we are entering a new era, with the best chances and the best expectations that the country has ever had," Roberto Civita, publisher of Veja, the nation's most influential newsweekly, wrote today.
The Real Plan, carried out on July 1, slashed Brazil's monthly inflation rate from 45 percent in June to 2 percent in December. Low inflation touched off a spending boom and a surge in factory production, cutting unemployment. Brazil recorded 5 percent growth in 1994, a level that is expected to be equaled in 1995.
The turnaround has been so decisive that Itamar Franco left Brazil's presidency today with an 88 percent approval rating, the highest on record for a departing Brazilian President.
Encouraged by the low inflation and high growth, investors have flooded into Sao Paulo's stock market, and foreign investment is expected to grow. Mr. Cardoso has also promised to speed Brazil's program of privatizing state companies.
To meet his 1995 goals of 6 percent growth and 26 percent annual inflation, Mr. Cardoso will have to marshal congressional support to change Brazil's Constitution to allow more foreign investment, to transfer health and education duties to states, to raise more taxes and to close a yawning pension fund deficit.
Brazil's Congress reconvenes on March 1, and, at least for the first few months, Mr. Cardoso is expected to enjoy majority support.
About 60 percent of Brazil's 594 congressional representatives support Brazil's new President, according to Marcos Antonio Maciel, the nation's new Vice President.
Mr. Cardoso was elected on Oct. 3 with twice as many votes as his closest competitor, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. Today, in inaugurations throughout Brazil, Cardoso allies became governors in 9 out of 10 of the most populous states, including Rio, Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais.
In composing his Cabinet, Mr. Cardoso expanded his three-party electoral coalition to include the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, the largest of 19 political parties represented in Congress.
The Cabinet is largely composed of men who are more than 45 years old, who have American university study on their resumes, and who are natives of Sao Paulo, Brazil's economic powerhouse.
One exception is the Special Minister for Sports: Edson Arantes do Nascimento, the retired soccer star known throughout the world as Pele. The first black in memory to be appointed to a Cabinet-level post, he has vowed to bring soccer fields to the millions of Brazilian children who live in urban shantytowns without access to them.

GEORGE PATAKI BEGINS NEW ERA
Calling for a new revolution to make government both smaller and more effective, George Elmer Pataki became the 53d Governor of New York with an inaugural address that promised "sweeping and fundamental change -- change that is certain and immediate." In the 38-minute address, long enough to lull 7-year-old Owen Pataki to sleep on his mother's lap, Mr. Pataki repeatedly summoned the imagery of the American Revolution and suggested that his election was born of the same discontent with taxation and bureaucracy that incited the colonials. 
 "The battle which took place on a farm not far from here near Saratoga was the turning point in that revolution," he said, returning later in the speech to what he called the "revolutionary spirit of Saratoga." Page 1.
 
CAN GOVERNOR KEEP CAMPAIGN PROMISES?
In his speech, Mr. Pataki declared war on the government he was elected to run. Like all inaugural addresses, it was bereft of detail. But Mr. Pataki did reiterate his campaign themes: along with streamlining government, he wants to reinstate the death penalty, reduce taxes, put welfare recipients to work and cut Medicaid. Can he? The death penalty will inevitably return, but the fate of other promises rests largely on two factors that got little mention: the economy and politics. Metro Matters, Page 29.
 
TRUTH IS IN THE SEATING ARRANGEMENTS
For all the pageantry of the first Republican inauguration in Albany in 24 years, it was the seating arrangements, more than anything, that hammered home how much things have changed. Reporter's Notebook, Page 29.
 
GEORGE PATAKI: PRAGMATIC CONSERVATIVE
To the friends he met at Yale College 31 years ago, Mr. Pataki was a garrulous, beer-loving freshman who knew precisely where he stood on the political spectrum (to the right), the name of the next President (Barry Goldwater) and what he would become when he grew up (Governor of New York State). To the politicians he passed along the way, Mr. Pataki was also a conservative, but often a pragmatic one. His central beliefs did not stop him from working with more moderate politicians or from sometimes moderating his own views on difficult issues to achieve his own goals. Page 1.
 
NEW YORK CITY
 
WASHINGTON HEIGHTS IS LESS VIOLENT
Although there is no evidence that the drug trade in Washington Heights has diminished significantly, it has become less violent. With the sharp decline in New York City's crime rate, the area offers evidence that the deadly edge of the drug business has dulled, at least momentarily, with police strategies more effective and some turf wars between dealers now settled. And with legions of former drug sellers now consigned to either cells or coffins, both the police and residents say there are fewer new recruits taking their places on the streets. Page 1.
 
THE POLICE TRACE BOMB PLOT IN NOTES
Notes and drawings found in the home of Edward J. Leary, who is accused of being the subway firebomber, show that he planned to detonate bombs with motion-sensing devices and remote controls and to gun people down with a high-powered rifle as part of a terror campaign in the subways, a law-enforcement official said. The two gasoline bombs that have been attributed to Mr. Leary were both meant to explode aboard trains while they were in tunnels, possibly under the East River, to achieve the maximum carnage and panic, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mr. Leary has denied any role in the bombings. Page 27.
 
MAN ARRESTED AFTER A RAPE IN THE BRONX
A woman going to visit a friend in the Morrisania section of the Bronx was raped at gunpoint by a man who forced her into his van, the police said. After he threw her back out onto the street, battered and bruised, she called 911 and described the attacker to the officers who responded to the call. Two hours later, the officers spotted a man fitting the description of the rapist, and after they called for help from backup units, he was arrested. The suspect, Eugenio Cruz Jr., 26, of 788 Fox Street, was charged with rape, assault and other crimes. Page 27.

HEADLINE: Eastern Germany's Road to Modernity Leads to the Shopping Mall

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LEIPZIG, Germany

 BODY:
Watching change come to eastern Germany since the collapse of Communism five years ago is like watching newsreels of life from the 1950's to the 1990's speed past in fast-forward.
Office buildings and construction cranes have sprung up in every major city. Streets have been torn up for new telephone lines, new sewers and new power cables, and then torn up again for new cable television wires. 
 New roads snake steadily out from city centers, drawing suburban housing developments with them and bringing cars, more cars and constant traffic jams.
Now comes what some think could change the traditional German urban life style more than anything else yet: the American-style suburban shopping mall, surrounded by vast parking lots with fast-food outlets and cineplexes. Leipzig has the biggest one in the country.
"We now have the greatest concentration of these shopping centers in all of Germany," said Niels Gormsen, the supervisor of construction projects in Leipzig. "We see a danger that too many could kill off downtown commercial districts, just like in America."
Mr. Gormsen and many other city planners here would like to avoid the crass commercial strips and decaying urban downtowns as successfully as they did in most medium-size west German cities over the last 40 years.
He, like many other civil servants here, came from the west to replace the Communist functionaries who emulated Soviet urban development models in the old days.
But since reunification, commercial development and social change have come so fast that the city authorities have not had the time that was granted to them in western Germany to plan their cities to remain livable and commercially viable at the same time.
There, Germans built underground parking garages, pedestrian zones and modern streetcar lines so cities and their neighborhoods could survive the automobile and monster suburban malls.
Here, the first thing that happened after capitalism came to eastern Germany in 1990 was a rush by west German retailers to open large commercial developments the fastest way they could, on undeveloped land just outside the crumbling major cities.
In the urban area around Leipzig (population 500,000) and Halle (300,000) alone, they have opened centers with a total floor space of 215 acres and have permission to build another 62 acres' worth. City planners have turned down plans for 173 acres more.
"What they are building now are bankruptcies in the making," said Dr. Ulrich Hatzfeld, an urban expert in Dortmund, who calculated that nearly half of the shopping centers now being planned in Germany were in the eastern part of the country, which has only 20 percent of the population and even less of the total purchasing power.
More than half of all retail shopping space in eastern Germany is outside the city centers, while in western Germany only 25 to 30 percent is, Dr. Hatzfield said. Apart from a few huge malls near Frankfurt and Cologne, big suburban stores tend to be specialty shops for furniture, carpeting or gardening equipment.
Even more shopping malls might have developed in eastern Germany if not for the country's restrictive laws, which require all stores to close at 6:30 P.M. most weekdays, early afternoon on most Saturdays and all day Sunday. Other laws restrict price discounts.
"The main danger we see is not to the centers of historic cities like Leipzig or Dresden, but to neighborhoods on the periphery," Mr. Gormsen said. "It wouldn't be bad, from the city's point of view, if some of these shopping centers did go bankrupt."
Already, it can take more than an hour to drive the 10 miles from Leipzig to Germany's biggest shopping mall, the Saale Park at the intersection of Highway 9 and Route 181, financed by a German savings bank. Two smaller malls have also sprouted along the way.
"Most days, you just sit in a traffic jam to get out here," said Gabriele Smetanin, who had come out to the Saale Park to do her Christmas shopping at the new Peek & Cloppenburg department store there. "Actually, their new store downtown has a better selection," Mrs. Smetanin said. "I came out of habit today, I suppose, because this one opened first."
What east German shoppers find in new malls like the Saale Park and the Sachsenpark on the northeast edge of town is the sort of thing familiar to suburban American shoppers. At Saale Park there is bland background music, a giant Toys "R" Us, a 10-cinema movie complex, an Ikea furniture store, McDonald's and acres of parked cars.
"We're bringing customers a variety of choice they never dreamed of in the Communist days," said Bernhard Jager, the manager of the Saale Park mall, "and we've created hundreds of jobs. The villages around here didn't even have decent plumbing and electric power until we brought it to them with the mall."
And the customers keep coming.
Five years ago, Leipzig was an industrially polluted mess, the late Gothic Thomaskirche where Johann Sebastian Bach spent his most creative years as choirmaster slowly crumbling and begrimed like most of the 19th-century commercial buildings around it.
Today the church gleams, restored with money from the city and the state of Saxony. After a western developer, Jurgen Schneider, disappeared early this year to avoid bankruptcy, German banks financed the completion of a new indoor shopping gallery around Auerbach's Keller, a tavern that is one of the settings for Goethe's "Faust."
The compact city center has so many shops, malls and office buildings under construction that picking through the narrow streets is like running an obstacle course. Peek & Cloppenburg's store, a dramatic stone-and-glass building designed by a Santa Monica, Calif., architectural team -- Charles Moore, John Ruble and Buzz Yudell -- opened on the main shopping street, the Petersstrasse, last summer.
What Leipzig's downtown doesn't have enough of is parking spaces. It did not even have parking meters until after Communism collapsed, and the few spaces that exist are inadequate. An underground garage is only in the planning stages in front of the modern Gewandhaus, home to the orchestra once directed by Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy and now by Kurt Masur, who is also the music director of the New York Philharmonic.
"The one sad aspect to all of this is that almost all the building is for places where west German companies can sell products made in west Germany to east German consumers," said Dr. Christoph Bockenforde, another city official who came from the west. "We're consuming here, not creating -- so far," he said.

HEADLINE: THE GOVERNOR;
'The People Seek Change': Transcript of Pataki's Inaugural

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of Gov. George E. Pataki's inaugural address in Albany yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:
 The change of administrations that we have just witnessed marks not just a transfer of political authority but a renewal of the democratic sanction under which it occurs, a reaffirmation of our common belief in a system of government that is ultimately answerable solely to the people. 
 It is also testimony to a political environment -- a political experiment in self-rule and individual freedom that when it began in this nation and state more than two centuries ago, most of the world saw as audacious and foolhardy, but one whose enduring vigor and simple good sense is testified to by our presence here this afternoon.
 As part of this democratic tradition, we have also just completed an election campaign that saw differing political views aired and argued, sometimes dispassionately, sometimes not so dispassionately all across our state.
 This sort of temporary division and robust disagreement is as it should be in a democracy. But now that the election is concluded, we meet here today to say, as President Jefferson taught us to say long ago, that we are all Democrats and all Republicans, that today our only resolve is to put the public interest above that of any party or faction.
 So, as we meet in this spirit of unity, we pledge as one people and one state to put aside personal and political differences and get on speedily and vigorously with the people's business.
 In that spirit, let me again acknowledge gratefully the assistance of Governor Cuomo in preparing for this change of administration.
 The Governor's three terms in office -- the Governor's three terms in office have earned him a rightful place in our history of our state. And Governor, now after 12 years I hope you will permit me again on behalf of all the people of New York to thank you and to thank Matilda for your devoted service.
 
The People's Moods
 Now, in mentioning the people's business, I also think it's fitting to mention today the people's moods. There is impatience, frustration, even for many, anger.
 To those who see this public attitude as disappointing or dangerous, I would point out that just such a mood was at the heart of the American experiment in self-government and personal liberty.
 Discontent with punitive taxation and the excessive bureaucracy and an oppressive government was exactly the emotion that put the spark to our own revolution and the democratic way of life it gave us.
 The battle which took place on a farm not far from here near Saratoga was the turning point in that revolution, and I would remind those who are disturbed by the people's current mood of the lesson from that battle -- the lesson that much good can come from the people's determination to see that government remains their servant and not their master.
 I would also remind them that impatience and frustration can exist only where there are also large reserves of hope and optimism and that abiding faith in the possibility of a better future. And as everyone here knows, New Yorkers have an abundance of hope and optimism.
 Despite government's failures or burdens, we have not given up our belief in ourselves, our families, our communities or in our great state of New York.
 We seek change precisely because we believe that under our democratic way of life, change can happen, change can work, change can restore and renew New York.
 
Achieving Greatness
 The kind of change -- the kind of change that can make this state of dreamers and doers, innovators and builders, the leading state in the Union, the Empire State once again.
 To achieve that greatness, we must again understand that personal freedom and opportunity are founded on our willingness to accept individual responsibility for ourselves and for the society we live in.
 I would also note that if today some of the people are angry, that anger is a generous and optimistic anger, one not directed at our fellow citizens or any group of our fellow citizens but at a government that has lost touch with its people.
 Let us be clear then about the public mood. We, the people, believe we can build a criminal justice system that protects the law-abiding and takes repeat violent felons off our streets.
 We, the people, believe we can create a school system that ends disorder in the classroom, cuts bureaucracy and makes excellence in learning and teaching again the hallmark of New York schools.
 We, the people, believe we can rid ourselves of a system of burdensome taxation and oppressive regulation that makes it too hard for entrepreneurs and small-business men and women to expand, innovate and become the source of new jobs in our economy.
 We, the people, believe we can encourage a business climate that will continue to make New York the home of commerce, finance and industry and a state where businesses, large or small, are anxious to locate, create jobs and expand opportunity.
 We, the people, believe we can cut spending and taxes, restore incentive and initiative and reform -- return freedom and responsibility to the individual.
 We, the people, believe we can restore pride and dignity to those in need of help by breaking the cycle of dependency and replacing welfare with workfare.
 And we, the people, believe we can make government serve not the special interests but the public interest, not those in office but those who place them in office.
 We, the people, know that we must launch a new era of individual liberty, responsibility and opportunity by removing obstacles government has placed in the path of an energetic and creative people.
 And to launch that new era is why the people have placed us here today. Let us begin.
 
A Real Crisis
 Today, then, as I begin my tasks as Governor, I make a pledge that I hope will be heard in every home in New York, my pledge that on this day of inaugural festivities and New Year's celebrations that your frustrations will not be forgotten, that your problems will not be overlooked, that I understand that the crisis is real -- a crisis not of the people's making but of the government's.
 And I say, what those in government have done, those in government can undo.
 So, I say to the members of the Legislature and my new administration as we begin together our work for a better New York: the people have turned to us for change and renewal. Let us get it right.
 The people seek change. Let us give them sweeping and fundamental change that is certain and immediate.
 We can reduce spending; we can reduce taxes and regulation; we can control crime; we can improve our schools; we can create workfare to replace welfare. Others have, and so can we.
 President Clinton has already announced the privatization of some Federal agencies, $24 billion in spending cuts, innovative housing vouchers and top-to-bottom welfare reform.
 I applaud the efforts of the new Congress and the President to move in this direction. But I do not propose today that New York merely follow the example of others. New Yorkers who built the Erie Canal and the greatest city in the world shouldn't be waiting -- we should be leading -- and we will.
 Our goal is not simply to do better. Our goal is to make this state again first in new jobs and economic opportunity, first in safe streets and sound schools, first in the number of creative citizens and productive businesses it attracts.
 I want our children and grandchildren to have the opportunity to build their lives here, not elsewhere.
 Our goal, simply put, is New York as the best place to live, the best place to build a future, to find a job, create a career and raise a family. New York's children belong in New York State. What New York has been for us -- a source of economic opportunity and civic pride -- we must make it again for those who follow.
 
Hope and Optimism
 Let us renew then that same spirit of hope and optimism that led those scorned as so-called colonial rabble to begin a revolution against the greatest empire on earth and give the world the American dream.
 A renewal of the same courage and determination that led so many immigrant millions -- my grandparents, Mario Cuomo's parents, the ancestors of all in this room to find here in New York State a doorway to hope and a threshold that in places like Ellis Island they could step across to gain for themselves and their children a share in the American dream.
 We have inherited so much that is good from those who against such great odds began this nation and state, from those immigrant millions who with little more than the clothes on their backs and a few possessions kept alive the promise of a better future.
 When we consider what they left us and the obstacles they faced, we cannot feel daunted or discouraged by the problems that confront us. With the same determination and courage and hope they showed in pursuing their dreams, we will pursue our own.
 We will fulfill our dreams as they fulfilled theirs by understanding that the creativity of the individual is the true source of economic and social progress, that the family is the nurturing ground of both personal development and a larger social harmony, a place where the individual learns and grows in respect for others and develops those vital habits of responsibility to God, country and community.
 In recovering the revolutionary spirit of Saratoga and the faith and optimism of Ellis Island, let us also remember the immigrant millions and the American revolutionaries were successful not only because they were wise but because they were free and they accepted responsibility.
 The American founders understood that a prerequisite to order and freedom and public safety is effective but limited government.
 From bitter personal experience, they learned that government has a terrible appetite for more power, an appetite that as it burdens its citizens with more taxes and more bureaucracy can bring down nations and empires.
 They knew this tendency of government -- with sometimes the best of intentions -- to grow bigger and more powerful has always posed history's most serious obstacle to social progress and its greatest threat to personal freedom.
 When government accepts responsibility for people, then people no longer take responsibility for themselves. Individual responsibility and personal freedom are inevitably linked.
 Limited government, then, was not just a slogan for the American founders, it was the path to greatness and the beginning of political wisdom.
 
Size and Cost
 Let us resolve now that in the months and weeks ahead, we will return to such wisdom. We will begin where the people want us to begin -- reducing the size and cost of government and getting rid of unnecessary and counterproductive programs.
 The people believe that government has become too big, too unwieldy, too distant, too arrogant, that every day government seems to grow not to benefit the taxpayers or the people but the bureaucrats, officeholders and the special interests. The people are right. Today, today government is simply too large.
 There are now 73 volumes of government regulations in New York State, over 55,000 pages of regulations. Laid end to end, that's 12 miles of red tape, enough to stretch from Albany to Schenectady and back again. This is wrong. This has to stop. And it will.
 The facts are these: spending is too high, the regulatory burden on our people excessive, our tax burden too heavy. Let me repeat what the people of this state already know: state government is too big and it spends too much money. It's simple. It's time for a change.
 Let us, then, cut government spending and cut it again -- remembering always that by downsizing government, we can restore people's confidence in the future by expanding individual responsibility and individual freedom.
 This is the challenge of the 90's -- the challenge we face as we prepare to enter the next century: to preserve and protect personal freedom and to restore individual responsibility.
 And as we confront our state' fiscal crisis, let us remember a simple truth: more government means higher taxes and fewer jobs; less government means lower taxes and more jobs.
 Some ask: to eliminate a $5 billion deficit, will we raise taxes or will we cut essential government services? To them we say there's another way -- a way to make government less expensive and more responsive.
 Countries like Canada and England and many states at home have shown it's possible to streamline government, improve services and cut costs by privatization. I will move aggressively on this front.
 In this connection, let us also remember that government works best when it is kept close to the people, that problems are best solved by those levels of government closest to them.
 So, just as I will fight to stop Washington from imposing unfunded mandates on the state, I will work with elected officials to reduce government's burden on the people at every level.
Whether in Washington, Albany or at the local level, government is too big and too inefficient. The answer lies not in the collective wisdom of a paid and pampered bureaucracy but in the genius of the individual and the people as a whole. Unfunded state mandates must end. Too often -- too often -- too often faceless bureaucrats tell local government what it must do, and it must do it. This too must end. This Governor believes in the power -- this Governor believes in the power of the people to make decisions for themselves.
 
Grave Problems
 In confronting the other grave problems before us, we also look to apply the wisdom of the past.
 Our founders believed that one area where government should be strong and effective was maintaining pubic order and public safety. They understood society's first obligation is to those citizens who obey the law and respect the rights of others, and they expect government to protect them from those who do not.
 To that end, I will be putting before the Legislature measures to eliminate work release and abolish parole for violent felons. Violent felons belong in jail. Violent felons belong in jail, and with your support, that is where they are going to be.
 Let me also note that when a society does not express its own horror at the crime of murder by enforcing the ultimate sanction against it, innocent lives are put at risk.
 Not out of a sense of vindictiveness, then, but a sense of justice -- indeed, a sense of compassion for those who otherwise might become victims of murder -- I will ask the Legislature to pass and I will sign and enforce the death penalty.
 And let me say -- and let me say: if one police officer's life is saved, if one less child is caught in a crossfire, if one fewer cabdriver or shopkeeper is killed in a robbery, then the death penalty will have proven itself worthwhile.
 Crime is a serious concern for all New Yorkers. But far too many New Yorkers also face the trap of a failed welfare system. Sadly, today 1 in 11 New Yorkers is on welfare. The welfare system, though well meaning, has failed. It's time for workfare.
 The welfare reforms -- the welfare reforms I present will stress reductions in bureaucratic overhead, consolidation of programs -- tighten restrictions but especially learnfare and workfare. All of them based on the principle that helping those less fortunate is a solemn obligation but that one of the most valuable means of providing such help is to look on welfare not as a way of life but as a means of temporary assistance, a step toward the dignity of self-sufficiency.
 Welfare was created to be a safety net -- a safety net that should act as a trampoline so that people bounce back to full and productive lives. Instead, that safety net has become a bureaucratic spider web, a web that entangles people and from which few ever escape. We intend to help them out of that web of dependency and back to lives that are rich in dignity and opportunity.
 In this effort to change not only welfare but to bring real, certain and swift change to government, I will seek the support of New Yorkers for measures that will give government more directly back to them in accountability and give them greater control over its activities.
 I will seek legislation that will put term limits on officeholders and give the people the clear, unmistakable democratic voice that is theirs with the right of initiatives and referendum.
 Let me also make another pledge. More than any other state, we have shown right here that people of different creeds, races and ethnic backgrounds can live and work together, that all people are part of the American dream and responsible for its greatest moments.
 As long as I am Governor -- and I ask all New Yorkers to join me in this -- I will do all that I can to fight racism or religious prejudice wherever it occurs. In our New York there is no place for bigotry or for intolerance.
 Let us move forward then in all these areas to reform government, to reduce the cost and size. But when we have achieved all this, let us also remember we are only at the beginning.
 I spoke a moment ago about the hopeful spirit and common-sense wisdom of our past.
 Those who fought at Saratoga and those who came after them at Ellis Island were an optimistic and hopeful people because they were wise enough to know that the true greatness of any nation is not found in the apparatus of government or state power. It is found in the people and all their spontaneous social, economic and spiritual association, in their families, churches and synagogues, fraternal and neighborhood organizations and all those mediating institutions that are the real source of economic, social and cultural progress.
 That famous early visitor to America, de Toqueville, noted that the genius of America lay not only in the spiritual fervor of its people but also in a remarkable voluntary spirit that came with this religious faith, the capacity and willingness of Americans to form together to help each other, to combine spontaneously for the benefit of all.
 
Public Spirit
 It should be clear that our goal is not just changing government but a much broader transformation of our democratic life -- a renewal of our public spirit. Our goal is to release all the native genius and the pent-up energy of a people and state that once gave the American Revolution its turning point. A state that provided the immigrant millions with a home for their dreams, a state that built an Erie Canal, an Empire State Building, a Wall Street and a Lincoln Center; a state that from Buffalo to Brooklyn, from Plattsburgh to Peekskill; from Rochester to the Rockaways, made itself the center of every industrial, commercial, cultural, communications and even sports revolution in America.
 With this clear understanding that the real strengths of our nation and state are its people, I will seek to help of New Yorkers through their community and neighborhood organizations to renew the greatness of New York.
 As we reduce the role of government, I will ask each of us to take an interest in the quality of our schools and involve ourselves -- from our farms to our suburbs and cities -- in the safety and development of our communities and neighborhoods. New Yorkers aren't afraid of that challenge.
 Hardly a day goes by when one of us somewhere isn't doing something heroic. New York is a state of heroes -- some famous, some not.
 Only a few short weeks ago here in Albany, we saw a situation all too familiar to us from the evening news as a gunman entered the State University, took students as hostages and threatened to kill them.
 When one student, Jason McEnaney, felt the danger to his life and others was imminent, he rushed the gunman. He sustained wounds but with the help of other students overpowered him.
 I spoke with Jason recently and am glad to see him looking so well today.
 Today, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to Jason McEnaney and thank him on behalf of the people of this state.
 And I'd also like to introduce to you four of the brave students who came to Jason's aid after he was wounded: Mike Connors, Kevin Iacobacci, Robert Romanino and Dackri Simpson. They, too, are true New York heroes.
 So, today as we inaugurate change in government, reaffirm our commitment to personal freedom and individual responsibility and renew our public spirit, I take up my duties as Governor in a spirit of optimism, with enthusiasm and confidence that government reform and democratic transformation can be achieved. And to those who still doubt our capacity for such achievement, I would ask them to consider not only our distant but our most recent past.
 Only a few short years ago the cold and dark of the cold war was everywhere. The world seemed fated to continue its terrible struggle between the superpowers. Which of us who lived through that era can forget those dangers, the setbacks and heartbreaks.
 Among the most vivid memories of my own boyhood is watching the faces of my grandparents in tears as they watched TV images of a heroic struggle for freedom in their native land crushed by Red Army troops and tanks on the streets of Budapest.
 All this now has changed.
 Today, millions around the world have a chance for freedom, prosperity and peace. So, we have seen in our own time what American leadership and this country's native hope and optimism can achieve for our own people, for all the world.
 In this American greatness and exceptionalism, those of us from this state have a special share.
 As visitors who gaze for the first time at the Statue of Liberty, tourists who see the lights of Broadway or honeymooners who watch the falls at Niagara, as they know, there is a special pace, rhythm and magic to our state.
 Look at the names of all those who came to greatness in New York -- political figures like Al Smith, Fiorello La Guardia, Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt.
 Sports heroes like Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle and Jackie Robinson.
 Great leaders from business, commerce and the arts.
 There is a music to New York, a rich and varied music that set America to singing, a music that came from the people, from Irving Berlin to Louis Armstrong, Cole Porter and George M. Cohan.
 That music is still ours. We need only to listen for it, to become part of its hopeful chorus.
 I love this state, its people and places for many reasons. I think of the bustle and excitement of New York City and the memorable years Libby and I lived there.
 I think of how our family has enjoyed more than I can say the natural beauty of places like Montauk or the time we spent upstate, or how much our children -- Emily and Teddy and Allison and Owen -- enjoy swimming near a covered bridge on the Batinkill River and walking the fields and the farms.
 But always in my own mind I come back to the Hudson Valley, a place whose beauty -- a place whose beauty gave America schools of great writers and great painters. Proudly and humbly, I think too of a local mailman's son who grew up in that valley and found there in his hometown of Peekskill all that is rich and good in the American dream.
 So that in my mind, when I'm home, two things stand out:
 First, the goodness of the people.
 And second, the only word I can find to express my feelings: gratitude.
 As New Yorkers and Americans, we are all grateful for all the opportunity we have had in our own lives and for those who gave it to us.
 
Fears and Faith
 I think sometimes about my four grandparents -- from Hungary, Ireland and Italy -- going through those gates and lines at Ellis Island. I know that their deep religious faith and their own daring spirit sustained them. But still I am sure that Yanos and Elizabeth Pataki, Agnes Lynch or Matteo Lagana -- they must have felt -- as Governor Cuomo's or Senator D'Amato's or Senator Moynihan's parents or grandparents must have felt -- their own fears about how they would do in this new land, in this new world.
 And I sometimes wonder if, as they filed through the lines of inspectors and health officials, what they would have said or felt if some predictor of the future had been able to tell them that they would not only just make a home here in New York but also find so much opportunity that one day their grandson would be Governor of the state of New York. That they would find their grandson Governor of a state that at the time must have seemed a foreign and perhaps forbidding place.
 You know, I think they might have believed it.
 I know my father is smiling today, and I only have to look down a few seats and see that my mother is smiling.
 With gratitude to the people of New York, for the spirit of hope and daring that brought so many to the New World and made them change and renew it, for the faith in God and the freedom he enjoins that they passed on to us -- a faith that has only recently brought democracy and hope to millions of people around the world. Let us now turn to problems left too long unattended at home.
 And as we do so, let us remember that only when the personal success and liberty that is the American dream touches every life in every corner of our state can it ever truly be our own.
 So let us now go forth, get to work and together restore New York to the greatness that is its destiny.
 God bless you.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Economy And Politics Still Govern

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
NEW YORK'S new Governor took office yesterday the way he ran for it. In language as focused as the voice-overs in his campaign commercials, George E. Pataki declared war on the government he was elected to run.
 "What those in government have done, those in government can undo," Mr. Pataki told an appreciative crowd of 13,000. 
 His speech, like all inaugural addresses, was bereft of detail. But Mr. Pataki did reiterate his campaign themes: Along with streamlining government, he wants to reinstate the death penalty, reduce taxes, put welfare recipients to work and cut Medicaid.
 Can he?
 The death penalty will inevitably return, but the fate of other promises rests largely on two factors that got little mention yesterday: the economy and politics. Both have a way of molding reality in Albany.
 The economy plays a singularly powerful role. It is much easier to cut taxes and services when the economy is growing. For instance, in Michigan, which has benefited from the rebounding automobile industry, Republican Governor John M. Engler has attracted national attention for shrinking state government. Would he and his budget director, Patricia A. Woodworth, have succeeded without a healthy economy?
 Ms. Woodworth, now Mr. Pataki's new budget director, will have to contend with New York's still-limping economy. Maybe it will bounce back. If so, Mr. Pataki will make good on some promises and be a hero. If not, he will have a very tough time delivering.
CUTTING taxes is one promise that is likely to be realized, in one form or another -- probably another. Mr. Pataki made it the cornerstone of his campaign and will have to deliver or lose credibility. But some legislators predict he will have to modify his plan to cut the top income tax rate by 25 percent in four years because the state faces a budget deficit of at least $4 billion, before a tax cut.
 Unless the economy revives, or unless Mr. Pataki can shrink government with unprecedented speed and efficiency, he will have to cut state aid to localities to cut taxes, because two-thirds of all state spending goes to local governments. Then local governments would have to raise their taxes to make up the difference. "Is this a tax cut plan, or tax shift plan?" Sheldon Silver, Democratic Speaker of the State Assembly, asked in an interview.
 Mr. Silver is Mr. Pataki's most formidable obstacle because he controls the Assembly and can stop Republican legislation. Democrats are not immune to the pressure of political trends, though, and it's a good bet that even Democratic legislators from New York City will agree to some kind of tax cut.
 Mr. Silver is also prepared to have a large say in Mr. Pataki's plan to cut the growth of Medicaid. So far, the Lieutenant Governor, Elizabeth P. McCaughey, has focused on cutting home care to the elderly and disabled, and on expanding Medicaid enrollment in managed care.
 Neither she nor Mr. Pataki has mentioned reimbursement rates to hospitals and nursing homes, which account for half the state's Medicaid costs. Perhaps, suggested Mr. Silver, that's because "Republican clients, generally, are the providers, not the recipients." And Democratic clients are generally recipients, which is one reason it is hard to cut Medicaid in New York.
 Mr. Pataki does not need legislative approval to put more welfare recipients to work. "Sadly, today one in 11 New Yorkers is on welfare," he said yesterday. "The welfare system, though well-meaning, has failed. It's time for workfare." But it is misleading to suggest that every welfare recipient, or even most, can go to work. Indeed, Mr. Pataki is only contemplating workfare for recipients of Home Relief -- mainly single adults without children. Those on Home Relief account for less than a third of the state's welfare recipients, and many of them cannot work because they are addicted, homeless or elderly.
MR. PATAKI often cites the program in Westchester, run by his new Social Services Commissioner, Mary E. Glass. But the county put less than 15 percent of its Home Relief recipients in jobs. Westchester did remove many from the rolls, often because they broke the rules by secretly working. That does save money if those people stay permanently off Home Relief; nobody knows yet if they do.
 Moreover, an effective workfare program is expensive because it demands intensive supervision, and so may not save as much as Mr. Pataki hopes. Another pledge the new Governor made yesterday -- keeping more felons in jail -- wouldn't save any money. In fact, it would mean building even more costly jail cells.
 And presumably government, cast as the enemy of the people in Washington and now in Albany, would have to build them.

HEADLINE: Bipartisan Foreign Policy

 BODY:
In the new year, President Clinton confronts a new foreign policy reality -- a Republican Congress. Republicans are less united on international issues than on their domestic agenda. But critics of specific Administration policies now lead both houses and chair key committees. They have ample constitutional power to obstruct the President's agenda and advance their own. The Senate has the authority to confirm nominees and ratify treaties, and both houses can vote down or condition appropriations for everything from foreign aid and intelligence to troop deployments.
Sharper foreign policy debate can be healthy. The Administration has not performed so brilliantly that it can afford to brush off useful criticism. No great philosophical differences divide Mr. Clinton from mainstream Republicans on many issues, and both parties need to consider how to reshape U.S. policies to a changed world. What are America's interests today? What are appropriate uses of U.S. military force? What is the right relationship between trade expansion and other objectives? 
 As a candidate, Mr. Clinton promised dramatic reversals on a few high-profile issues like Bosnia, China and Haiti. That rhetoric was soon abandoned. Aside from Haiti, Mr. Clinton has generally kept George Bush's policies in place while focusing on domestic reform. A broad consensus is likely to continue over trade, the Middle East and some elements of arms control. Congressional challenges are likely over Bosnia, NATO, Russia, China, peacekeeping and foreign aid.
Republican leaders liken foreign aid to welfare and demand that most aid not related to security or political aims be cut. But the aid budget has already been cut by nearly a third over the last five years, and most foreign aid is related to security or political aims. Of the $14 billion foreign aid budget, $5 billion is earmarked for Israel and Egypt and another $1.2 billion goes to assist countries trying to move from socialism to capitalism. Most of the remainder goes to humanitarian, environmental and population programs that are the best insurance against new Somalias and Rwandas.
Republicans will press for more aggressive efforts to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government, efforts the Administration should try to harness and in some cases support. Washington should make clear to its European allies that if they prevent the U.N. from lifting the embargo, the Administration may be unable to resist Congressional pressure for the U.S. to lift it independently. The Administration should vigorously resist all calls for direct U.S. involvement in the war.
Many Republicans favor incorporating Eastern European countries in NATO, which would needlessly isolate and provoke Moscow. Eastern Europe needs economic support and early access to the European Union far more urgently than it needs new military guarantees. The Administration itself moved too hastily last year toward moving the NATO security umbrella eastward.
Mainstream Republicans favor continued support for reform and arms reduction in Russia, but want to make aid conditional on how Moscow treats the former Soviet republics. Such conditioning must be done carefully. America's security does not lie in isolating and humiliating Russia, but in encouraging its constructive participation in European and Asian affairs.
Republicans will also insist that Washington stand up more forcefully to Chinese bullying on human rights, trade, Taiwan and Tibet. A tougher line could help over time, but short-term progress is unlikely with China already in the throes of a succession struggle.
International peacekeeping has been a favorite Republican target, even though the Administration is now cautious to a fault about committing U.S. troops to such operations. Recent U.N. operations have been troubled. But peacekeeping is a cost-efficient deal for the U.S. If the U.N. were so financially hobbled that it could no longer mount operations in support of policies Washington favors, American forces might have to act alone, at far greater human and financial cost to the U.S.
This Administration still has a chance to leave a credible foreign policy legacy, but for the next two years it will have to do so in conjunction with mainstream Republicans like Senator Richard Lugar and Representative Benjamin Gilman. There will be unbridgeable differences. There should be substantive debate. But with good will and good luck, the result could be the kind of bipartisan foreign policy politicians often rhapsodize about but rarely produce.

HEADLINE: Trade Accords Have Sown Violent Seeds

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Having declared the North American Free Trade Agreement "a death sentence" for Mexico's Indians, the rebel leader Subcomandante Marcos has written to the new President, "Welcome to the nightmare" (news article, Dec. 29). 
 But the situation in Mexico is only a hint of what is to come. Just as Mexico's many corn farmers will be displaced by cheap imported corn, the millions of farmers of rice, corn and sugar in one of the next hot spots, the Philippines, will similarly find themselves displaced.
"You need to switch from basic crops to high-value crops like flowers," the Philippine Senate has told its farmers, most of whom are still using the primitive water buffalo-and-plow method to till their land. But the farmers do not have the capital to produce new crops, and the government is too broke to help.
The world's elite recently congratulated itself on its wisdom at having passed the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, despite widespread grass-roots opposition. But the same elite is due for a rude awakening. The uprising in the Mexican state of Chiapas -- and the billions of dollars that investors have lost as a result -- are a portent of the desperation and violence we will witness as a result of trade agreements that will displace millions from their livelihoods.
Regarding the economy, President Clinton said in his election campaign, "I feel your pain." Then he actively campaigned for passage of trade agreements that will only worsen that pain for many of America's workers.
The world's elite has just begun to feel the pain that will result from its actions on those two fateful trade accords.

When Mexico's new President goes on television tonight, the challenge he faces will be to lay out specific plans for a financial recovery that will not worsen the country's simmering social problems. President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon will also work to convince investors that the Mexican market they once adored was not imagined. Mr. Zedillo's stabilization plan will set much of Mexico's economic course for the year. [Page 39.]
 

Like other big economic losers in 1994, Mexico failed to respond quickly when the economic world around it began to change, or to realize how risky its economic strategy was until it was too late. Mexico's risks were built into a strategy of luring investors with high interest rates and a narrow currency-trading range. Economic Memo. [39.]
 
China's central bank raised interest rates on loans to financial institutions by slightly less than one-quarter of 1 percent. The move was aimed at confronting the country's continued strong growth and rising inflation by controlling some excess investment. [39.]
 
The American-style shopping mall has come to eastern Germany. Some people think that the malls, surrounded by vast parking lots with fast-food outlets and cineplexes, could have a strong effect on traditional German life. [5.]
 
The Economy
 
Do the poor deserve a minimum standard of living? That is the heart of a debate developing in Washington over entitlement programs, many of which are disliked by many of the Republicans who will take control of Congress on Wednesday. [1.]
 
Cuts in state taxes and spending were among the goals set by New York's new Governor, George E. Pataki, in his inaugural address, which promised "sweeping and fundamental change that is certain and immediate." [1.]
 
After a strong start, 1994 limped to a disappointing close for Wall Street's underwriters. New issues of stocks and bonds totaled $709 billion for the year, down nearly 33 percent from 1993's record of more than $1 trillion and the lowest total since 1991. [39.]
 
The Media Business
 
The record industry was highly prosperous and full of turmoil in 1994, and the impact of an upheaval in its executive ranks is expected to ripple through the industry this year. Sales of recorded music in the United States last year were expected to reach a new high of $11 billion, up 10 percent from 1993. Optimism remains high for this year, when many big-name releases are planned. [39.]
 
The demand for radio ads grew last year, allowing the industry to raise rates after several years of marking them down to gain business. Radio executives are optimistic that strong increases will be posted again in 1995. Part of 1994's growth spurt came in talk radio: stations carrying anything but music grew to 1,028 last year from 841 in 1993. [42.]
 
Mothers who are taking time off from their careers to raise their children are the focus of a Levi's advertising campaign that could be the forerunner of a broader marketing trend.

HEADLINE: Burden of Proof on Mexico's President Tonight

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 1

 BODY:
When President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon goes on national television Monday night to outline his plan for rebuilding the crippled Mexican economy, he will also be doing his best to convince investors that the Mexican market they once thought the world of was not a mirage.
 Mr. Zedillo worked through the New Year's weekend to put the finishing touches on an economic-stabilization plan that will limit wages, prices and Government spending while lining up the financial backing of the United States and Canada, major European nations, American commercial banks and the International Monetary Fund. 
In the United States as well as Mexico, investment bankers, money managers and financial analysts will be watching to see how Mr. Zedillo -- in office just a month -- applies the economics he learned at Stanford and refined at the Mexican central bank to this politically explosive situation. His challenge will be to lay out an economic recovery, while setting a national agenda that can keep the lid on simmering social problems bound to be worsened by the disastrous devaluation of the peso last month.
 Along with the details of a Government agreement with labor and business that will be disclosed Monday night, Mr. Zedillo's stabilization plan will set much of Mexico's economic course for 1995. The most important points are expected to be these:
 *How does Mr. Zedillo intend to control inflation without causing a recession and possibly increasing social unrest?
 *How will price controls be enforced?
 *What policy will Mexico use to set exchange rates?
 *Which Government-owned companies will be sold to investors to raise badly needed dollars?
 *What is the size and structure of the international rescue package, and will it be sufficient to restore investors' confidence?
 "The main risk is that when you already are under a lot of pressure, you have to be real convincing," said Neal M. Soss, an economic consultant in New York. "The world can be in an unforgiving frame of mind. If his plan doesn't appear to cover all the bases, and doesn't offer well-thought-out answers to all questions, he runs the risk of having another flight of capital."
 The peso's devaluation could turn out to be enormously damaging for Mexico. A study by Bear, Stearns & Company estimates that if the peso trades at a rate of about 4.90 to the dollar -- it closed at 5.0750 to the dollar on Friday --Mexico's gross domestic product could fall to $250 billion in 1995 from $333 billion in 1993. Per-capita income might decline to $2,700 from $3,600 in 1993. The national debt would increase to 40 percent of gross domestic product, up from 26 percent.
 To make his stabilization plan work, Mr. Zedillo will rely on the same sort of pact with labor and business that Mexican administrations have used for the last seven years.
 The agreement, backed by the persuasive powers of a party that has been in control for 65 years, helped get Government, labor and business to agree to hold down prices, wages and public spending. All these groups stopped making wage and price demands based on existing inflation rates and agreed instead to work toward steadily improving targets, which helped bring down inflation to 8 percent in 1993 from 159 percent in 1987.
 The President is expected to reject the old commitment to a semi-fixed exchange rate policy and adopt a more flexible system.
 In previous pacts, the Government agreed to hold the line on prices for goods it produces, like electricity and gasoline. It also pledged to keep the value of the peso within a tight trading band, no matter what changes took place in the international markets. As a result, the peso grew stronger -- which Mexicans liked because it meant that books, breakfast cereal or almost anything produced in the United States became cheaper.
 From 1985 to 1992, imports grew by 238 percent. Exports increased by only 73 percent in the same years.
 By the end of 1994, Mexico was importing so much more than it was exporting that it had accumulated a deficit of $28 billion. The Government financed the debt with foreign money, a tactic that became impossible after investors started turning away from Mexico. That led to a weeklong speculative run on the peso, which ended just before Christmas. The Government decided that it did not have enough money in reserve to defend the peso, and was forced to allow it to float freely.
 Within a few days, Mexico's currency fell in value almost 30 percent.
 Some economists have accused the Government of hubris, saying finance officials had become overly confident they could ward off any assault on the peso. They entered the crisis with $17 billion in reserves and $7 billion in standby lines of credit from the United States and Canada.
 This was not enough. More than $10 billion was pulled out of the country, first by Mexican investors, then by foreigners that week before Christmas.
 Mexico is now looking for even greater backing from its trading partners. In the package that is already lined up, the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland, which represents the central banks of Europe, will lend Mexico $6 billion to $10 billion. In addition, several American commercial banks have been asked to syndicate a loan of $3 billion to $6 billion.
 There may also be some help from the International Monetary Fund, particularly in supervising the way Mexico handles the loans and its emergency stabilization plan. The appointment on Thursday of Guillermo Ortiz as Finance Minister -- in place of Jaime Serra Puche, who resigned -- could prove useful, as he worked as an executive director of the I.M.F. from 1984 to 1988.
 Many analysts say international backing will create confidence and help Mexico hold on to the foreign investments that have not yet been pulled out. One of Mexico's biggest concerns is the $30 billion in Government notes known as tesobonos that come due in 1995. The notes are paid in pesos but are pegged to dollars, and the devaluation has substantially increased Mexico's obligations.
 To encourage investors to roll over those notes instead of cashing them in, the central bank is expected to offer to replace mature tesobonos with something called sovereign debt bonds that will have longer terms and higher interest rates.
 Another important part of Mr. Zedillo's plan is to raise the Government's dollar revenue by speeding up the privatization of ports, petrochemical plants and electricity-generating stations. The Government will also try to exploit the short-term price advantages of the devaluation to stem the flow of imports while increasing exports. The plan calls for cutting the current-account deficit of more than $28 billion by more than half by year's end.
 Some economists think that is too optimistic. But after the 1982 devaluation, the current-account deficit fell to $6 billion from $16 billion.
 So far, the loudest complaints about devaluation have come from foreign investors. The Mexican people, preoccupied with the holidays and vacations, have not yet said much. Mexicans who have lived through other devaluations know they will again be asked to sacrifice. After the devaluation of 1982, for example, real wages fell 24 percent.
 The outlook for the new year has already changed. When Mr. Zedillo took office on Dec. 1, official estimates for 1995 were a growth rate of 4 percent, inflation of 4 percent and pay increases of 10 percent, substantially above the inflation rate.
 Now, Government economists are predicting 1 to 2 percent growth, 15 percent inflation and wage increases that do not keep up with inflation.
 Inflation ravaged Mexico in the early 1980's and is again a central concern. "The most difficult part of the recovery will be to really keep inflation in check," said Nora Lustig, an economist with the Brookings Institution in Washington.
 The prices of products made of domestic material and sold in Mexico should not be affected by the devaluation. But after a devaluation, a kind of panic sets in and pushes everyone to raise prices, regardless of whether the product is imported. Just a few days after the Government said that prices across the board had been frozen for 60 days, the federal consumer protection agency shut down 27 stores in greater Mexico City for jacking up the prices of -- among other things -- tortillas and milk.
 "The Government will probably be able to get agreement from the business leaders not to raise prices, but what if there is no discipline in the ranks?" Ms. Lustig said. "What is supposed to be a single jump in prices to reflect the devaluation could become a spiral."

HEADLINE: Economic Memo;
The World Shifted, but Not Mexico

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
Mexico has this in common with Orange County, Calif., and with derivatives plungers and other big losers in 1994: It failed to respond quickly when the economic world around it began to change, or to realize how risky its economic strategy was until it was too late.
 Mexico's risks were built into a strategy of luring investors with high interest rates and a narrow currency-trading range, international economists here have concluded. 
That strategy paid off handsomely from 1991 to 1993, as foreign investors who found a limited number of attractive places to put their money during a global recession poured money into Mexican bonds and notes paying 15 percent interest and bought millions of shares in the fast-rising Mexican stock market.
 Mexicans spent the money buying far more goods from abroad than the country could pay for with the proceeds from its exports -- running trade deficits three times as large as the biggest American deficits of the 1980's, if the sizes of the two economies are taken into account.
 The strategy flew in the face of advice from officials of the International Monetary Fund. The result, as President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon acknowledged in a speech last week, has been disastrous.
 The changes in the economic world that proved so devastating to Mexico's strategy came from a multitude of sources, at home and abroad. The Federal Reserve's decision in February to begin driving up interest rates made it more attractive for many to invest in the United States, rather than Mexico.
 Many other nations' economies began to emerge from recession and compete for international investment in 1994. And political violence in Mexico made loans and stock purchases there seem riskier.
 When the money stopped flowing in, the Mexican Government spent close to $20 billion in six months to defend the peso's value. When reserves ran low, top officials were forced to abandon the centerpiece of their economic policy: a guarantee that no matter what happened, a fistful of pesos would hold its value in dollars. The peso has since lost roughly 30 percent of its value.
 International Monetary Fund officials refuse to claim vindication. Financial analysts have been more outspoken.
 "If the Mexican authorities had followed more closely the exchange-rate readjustment suggested by the I.M.F. models and research, there wouldn't have been the chaos you saw in the markets," said Gregory A. Fossedal, a writer in Arlington, Va., who follows the I.M.F. closely.
 Mexico followed much, but not all, of the advice dispensed by the I.M.F., the World Bank and other international economic organizations. It sold state-owned enterprises to private buyers. It balanced the budget. And it eliminated trade barriers, most notably through the North American Free Trade Agreement, which took effect a year ago.
 But the Government chose not to run the risk of social turmoil from devaluing the peso, which would have made popular foreign goods more expensive at home.
 Consumer prices in Mexico rose 27.9 percent from the end of 1991 through the middle of this year. Yet the value of the peso in dollars fell only 9.4 percent during this period. For would-be foreign buyers with dollars to spend, the slightly cheaper currency was not nearly enough to offset the higher prices.
 Evidence that the peso needed to fall further was visible in stores in south Texas this fall. Throngs of Mexican shoppers were coming across the border because the prices were often cheaper than at home.
 The result was an immense trade deficit, reaching 8 percent of Mexico's economic output in 1994. The rule of thumb commonly used by the I.M.F. and other international economic organizations is that a developing country's trade deficit should not exceed its economic growth rate. Mexico's annual growth has ranged from 1 to 3 percent in the last couple of years.
 Such large deficits lead inevitably to disaster, said a senior economist at an international economic organization.
 A 1989 letter from the I.M.F. to the Mexican Government warned that if nothing was done, the trade balance, broadly measured to include some financial flows, would double by 1994. But Mexico allowed its line of credit at the I.M.F. to lapse in May 1993 -- which cut it free from the fund's advice, but also from its money.
 Still, Mexican policy makers had reason for optimism as a result of the successful negotiation and approval in 1993 of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The accord prompted foreign investors to pour more money into the country. But as President Zedillo pointed out in his speech on Thursday, most of that money went into stocks and bonds that could be quickly sold if confidence faltered.
 To be sure, the United States has sustained big trade deficits for many years and relied heavily on foreign investment in American stocks and bonds. One difference is that the American trade deficits have stayed under 3 percent of economic output. Another is that the United States does not try to fix the value of the dollar to other currencies, allowing it constantly to rise and fall against other money in markets around the world.
 By the end of 1993, foreign investors in Mexico were spending six times as much adding to their portfolios of Mexican stocks and bonds as to build factories or buy controlling stakes in Mexican companies. These stock and bond investors proved fickle, I.M.F. figures show.
 After a peasant insurgency began in a southern state last January and the front-running presidential candidate was assassinated in March, the pace of these investments slowed severely -- by 86 percent in three months.
 Mexico tried until Dec. 22 to maintain a minimum value in United States currency for the peso, through the use of a trading band whose lower limit declined at a very slow, steady rate. Shortly before the recent plunge, the Government had effectively guaranteed that anyone who wanted to sell 100 pesos could get $29 for them -- 29 cents apiece. It would go into the market and buy pesos at this price if no one else chose to.
 When Mexicans and foreigners wanted to sell pesos for dollars this autumn, the Mexican Government became the biggest buyer. In the last two months alone, it reportedly spent more than $10 billion buying pesos.
 By late last month, the central bank's hoard of foreign currency had fallen dangerously low. The Government lowered its guarantee level -- the process of devaluation -- to $25 for 100 pesos. A day later, with central bank reserves at just $6 billion, the Government abandoned the guarantee entirely, allowing the peso to trade freely in the currency markets. By the close of trading last Tuesday, 100 pesos were worth only $17.54, though their value had bounced back to $19.72 by the end of trading on Friday.
 Patrick Conway, an associate professor of economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who specializes in the Mexican economy, said Mexico did not appear to have learned from past mistakes.
 In the late 1970's, as in 1993, Mexico abandoned its line of credit with the International Monetary Fund and pursued a strategy of fast economic growth that included huge trade deficits financed with foreign money. In 1982, as in 1994, the outcome was a collapse in the peso and the need for an international rescue.
 The parallels, Mr. Conway said, suggest that in each case Mexican officials "were perhaps too hasty in cutting their ties to the financial institutions that got them where they were."

HEADLINE: New Stock and Bond Issues Fell by Almost 33% in 1994

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN

 BODY:
After a strong start, 1994 limped to a disappointing close for Wall Street's underwriters.
 New issues of stocks and bonds totaled $709 billion for the year, down nearly 33 percent from 1993's record of more than $1 trillion and the lowest total since 1991, according to the Securities Data Company, a Manhattan research firm. 
The large decline in underwriting volume is the best illustration of the difficulties that plagued the securities industry last year, its most trying since the downturn of the late 1980's.
 Underwriting new stocks and bonds is one of the industry's most lucrative businesses. In 1994 the total underwriting fees disclosed by Wall Street companies plunged more than 39 percent from 1993, according to Securities Data.
 But not all the news was bad for Wall Street in 1994. Mergers and takeover activity reached a record $339.4 billion, surpassing the previous record of $335.8 billion set in 1988, according to Securities Data.
 In contrast to the highly speculative takeovers typical of the merger boom of the 1980's, the 1994 deals were dominated by corporations making strategic moves to increase their reach in industries like telecommunications, health care, pharmaceuticals, financial services and high technology.
 Analysts and investment bankers expect the merger trend to continue this year, as a weak dollar and relatively strong stock market make deals attractive. And as buyers look beyond banks to finance their deals, the trend could also help to lift the junk bond market.
 The plunge in underwriting volume shows how swiftly Wall Street's fortunes can decline. The year began strongly, as the industry continued to ride a four-year boom that had seen steady declines in interest rates. With rates at a record low in 1993 and stock prices strong, many corporations took the opportunity to raise cash by issuing stocks and bonds.
 When the Federal Reserve began raising short-term interest rates in February, the issuing of debt became more expensive. At the same time, the strong economy lifted revenue for many companies, diminishing their need to tap the markets for capital.
 "Most companies had pre-funded a lot of their debt needs for the next year or two in 1993," said Seth Waugh, managing director of global debt financing at Merrill Lynch & Company, which was the industry's leading underwriter in 1994 for the seventh consecutive year.
 As the Fed continued to raise rates in each quarter, the volume of new bond issues declined. The $117 billion raised from new issues in the fourth quarter was nearly 60 percent lower than the amount raised in the first quarter. It was also the lowest quarterly total since the end of 1990, according to Securities Data.
 Over all, the underwriting of mortgage-backed securities slid the furthest last year, falling 57 percent, as the climb in interest rates ended a boom in home-mortgage refinancing. Junk-bond underwriting fell nearly 39 percent, followed by investment-grade debt, whose underwriting fell 27 percent.
 The rising rates also took their toll on the underwriting of stocks. Though the business remained relatively strong in the first half of the year, it fell off quickly as investors began to worry that the rising returns offered by bonds would divert funds from the stock market.
 "By the third quarter, the environment was very difficult on the new-issues side," said Tom Davis, head of equity capital markets at Merrill Lynch. The number of new issues dried up as companies postponed or canceled offerings.
 Though the stock markets have remained relatively strong, the equity underwriting business has stayed weak. "While the flow of funds into equities has slowed, it has not reversed," Mr. Davis said. "The concern is still out there, but the reality hasn't materialized yet."
 As domestic new issues dried up, a larger portion of new issues of both debt and equity in the second half of 1994 were foreign. That is a trend that Merrill Lynch expects to continue this year.
 "Foreigners didn't really take advantage of lower rates," Mr. Waugh said. Emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe are in a building phase, and if they are looking for long-term debt, they have little choice but to tap the American capital markets, he added.
 But James A. Bianco, director of research at the Arbor Trading Group in Barrington, Ill., said domestic debt issuers were scarce because they were getting better deals from banks.
 "Wall Street has a problem," he said. "It is pushing a product that is not very attractive in the current environment."
 That is because, with short-term lending rates high, banks can raise cash from depositors relatively cheaply. Meanwhile, Wall Street companies have been forced to pay higher short-term rates to finance their underwritings. And the banks are making loans at relatively high medium-term rates.
 The banks also helped fuel the record number of deals in 1994. "The level of interest rates is not as key as the availability of funds," said Eric Gleacher, an investment banker who specializes in mergers and acquisitions.
 Mr. Gleacher and other merger specialists say that the number of deals will remain high next year as industries continue to consolidate. "I think you are going to see more activity from European companies next year," he said, "because the European economy is coming back and the dollar is very weak."

HEADLINE: Yeltsin's Next Quagmire?

BYLINE: By Andrew Meier; Andrew Meier writes frequently on Russian affairs.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Unlike Russia's secessionist crisis in Chechnya, the danger of a collapse of Tajikistan peace talks and renewal of the civil war there-- by far the bloodiest in any of the former Soviet republics -- cannot be dismissed as an internal Russian matter.
United States policy should aim to develop the small Central Asian republic of Tajikistan as an independent member of the world community. Instead, Washington has been surprisingly silent from the time war broke out in May 1992 until a cease-fire took hold in October in the small mountain country of 5.6 million, sandwiched between Afghanistan, China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. 
 In Tajikistan, three years after the Soviet Union crumbled, Russia has succeeded in resurrecting a piece of its old empire. Although the republic, ravaged by the civil war and nearly broke, is nominally independent, last year it uneasily accepted Russia's bear hug. The result is protection, Mafia-style.
Seventy percent of Tajikistan's state budget comes from Russia, 25,000 Russian "peacekeepers" are there to protect what President Boris Yeltsin calls Russia's border with Afghanistan and the Defense Minister is a Russian general. Moscow's main mission is to keep fighters, weapons and drugs from entering from Afghanistan.
While the Tajiks have no oil, neighboring Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have plenty. Chevron and other American companies have invested millions of dollars in developing Central Asia's oil and gas fields. Moscow's stake is no smaller than the oil companies' in keeping the region calm, preventing the civil war from resuming and possibly spreading.
Tajikistan's economy -- it was always the poorest republic -- is crippled, and political repression is the norm. It needs Western support for reconstruction. But even though the war has taken perhaps 50,000 lives and forced more than 650,000 refugees to flee, since early 1992 Tajikistan has received only $96 million in U.S. aid. Of this, $61 million has been in food shipments (mostly wheat), $15 million in private donations and the rest in technical assistance.
J. Brian Atwood, Administrator of the Agency for International Development, said last month, "AID is the state of the art of preventive diplomacy." Yet, his agency has cut its technical assistance to Tajikistan from $18 million in fiscal 1994 to $9 million in the current, 1995 fiscal year.
 Tajikistan's autocratic regime has its human rights record partly to blame for the West's unwillingness to help. The regime has been notoriously repressive, in the opinion of Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.
The war and its aftermath were marked by atrocities on both sides. When I visited Tajikistan in April, one pro-Government fighter told me, "No one paid much attention to any Geneva conventions." Whole villages, burned and bulldozed, were reduced to parched fields in a form of "ethnic cleansing."
The Tajiks' truce, punctuated by occasional skirmishes, is shaky. The cease-fire that began in October has been extended to Feb. 6. A fourth round of peace talks between the Government of President Imamali Rakhmonov, a diehard Communist, and an alliance of opposition factions is scheduled for later this month in Moscow. The talks were arranged by Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali of the United Nations. By early this year, a total of 40 U.N. cease-fire observers, authorized by the Security Council last month, will have arrived.
When Tajikistan became independent in 1991, it had no national identity and no security forces, and the gross national product depended almost wholly on cotton. Since the republic lacked a unifying ethnic identity, no nationalist movement proved strong enough to fill the ideological vacuum left by the demise of Soviet rule.
In the political violence that broke out, on one side were the people in the provinces of Leninabad (renamed Khojand) and Kulyab, who ran the Government during the Soviet era. On the other side were Garmis and Pamiris, desperately poor peoples who saw an opportunity for a share in the central Government after being shouldered aside and oppressed during decades of Communist rule. They found allies with intellectuals and others in the capital, Dushanbe, who wanted a stronger Islamic presence, more democracy -- and personal power, too. Clan and regional loyalties played an important role in the fighting.
In 1992, after military intervention by Russia and Uzbekistan, the Leninabad-Kulyab alliance triumphed, and has sought to legitimize its rule ever since. On Nov. 6, the regime, now headed by Mr. Rakhmonov, staged the first presidential election since the war began and won. It was hardly democratic, since all opposition parties were banned and Mr. Rakhmonov ran against his own ambassador to Moscow, who himself charged fraud after the votes were counted.
Not surprisingly, the Tajiks have few friends in Washington. In October, Representatives Robert Andrews, Democrat of New Jersey, and Benjamin Gilman, Republican of New York, co-sponsored a successful resolution linking aid to an improvement in the regime's human rights record.
A handful of American organizations have given food and medical relief. The financier George Soros has donated $1 million, mostly to help returning refugees. And the U.N. has asked for nearly $30 million to finance humanitarian needs.
All U.S. humanitarian aid should continue unconditionally. But grants for economic development should be linked to emergence of the rule of law and respect for human rights norms.
With Senator Jesse Helms, a foe of foreign aid, soon to be chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, President Clinton would have an uphill problem trying to help the Tajiks. Clearly, bromides about building democracy would be absurd. But, with the lesson of Bosnia in mind, he can help assure peace by lending support to the talks in Moscow.
When I was visiting the Tajiks, I saw how important it was for America to try to check renewed Russian imperialism. One day I was squeezed in an elevator in the Hotel Tajikistan, in the capital, with a number of Russian officers. It stopped on a middle floor and a timid Tajik clutching Red Cross provisions peered in. "Don't worry," a colonel assured him. "There's room here for all of us." The Tajik, who appreciated the dangers of overloading Soviet-made elevators, begged off. The doors closed on the colonel's reassuring invitation, which unintentionally echoed the Soviet colonialism still fresh in Tajik memory.

HEADLINE: Mexico Delays Austerity Plan as Labor and Business Balk

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 2

 BODY:
President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon postponed a televised address to the nation tonight after Government officials were unable to reach an agreement with labor and business leaders on an austere package of wage and price controls.
Investors in both Mexico and the United States had been awaiting the message to see how Mr. Zedillo was planning to rebuild Mexico's economy after a brutal devaluation two weeks ago that lowered the value of the Mexican peso by 30 percent. The speech also was intended to rebuild investor confidence by showing that Mr. Zedillo was firmly in control of the economy, an image undoubtedly obscured by the postponement. 
 Mexican officials did confirm tonight that Mr. Zedillo's plan includes an $18 billion international loan package -- half paid for by the United States -- to help Mexico stabilize the peso and recover from its economic crisis.
At first, the President's speech was scheduled to be delivered at 6 P.M., but it was delayed several times because of unexpectedly strong resistance from labor union leaders who were not immediately willing to accept the Government's offer of wage increases less than the anticipated rate of inflation.
Shortly after 11 P.M. the President's office announced that the speech had been postponed until sometime Tuesday morning.
Under the plan, the United States will expand a permanent $6 billion credit line to $9 billion, with one half coming from the Treasury Department's Exchange Stabilization Fund and the other half from the Federal Reserve System, the Mexican officials said. The additional money will be available for only six months.
Mexico will be able to use the money to stabilize the value of its currency by buying pesos on the foreign exchange markets. If Mexico draws on the loan, it must repay the money at an interest rate equal to the rate on the three-month United States Treasury bill at the time the withdrawal is made.
Canada also will increase its standing credit line of $1 billion Canadian to $1.5 billion. The Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland, which is owned by the European Central Banks, is providing a $5 billion credit line.
A group of about a dozen international commercial banks, including Citibank, has been asked to put up a $3 billion line of credit.
The International Monetary Fund will not lend Mexico any money but is expected to make a strong statement of support for Mexico, which could help regain the confidence of international investors.
A big part of Mr. Zedillo's planned address was to have been directed at investors in the United States and Mexico who have withdrawn billions of dollars from the Mexican market since the crisis began.
Guillermo Ortiz, the new Finance Minister, began at 9:30 A.M. to negotiate wage and price controls with business and labor leaders and representatives of peasants' organizations. Mr. Ortiz took office on Thursday, replacing Jaime Serra Puche, who acknowledged that he had bungled the devaluation and resigned.
Government officials had expected the meeting to go smoothly and Mr. Zedillo was supposed to address the nation at 6 P.M. But union members balked at the substantial cut in real wages, according to one official involved in the discussions. Government economists project that inflation in 1995 will be about 15 percent. Minimum wages are not likely to increase by more than 10 percent.
The Government's position is that wages must be restrained to keep the peso devaluation from unleashing another burst of inflation.
The inflation rate rose through most of the 1980's, peaking at 159 percent in 1987. The rate was reduced to 8 percent in 1993 and, until the devaluation, was expected to be below 10 percent again in 1994.
Financial markets in Mexico were open today, even though markets in the United States and some other countries were closed. The Mexican peso regained some strength against the dollar. The dollar was quoted today at 4.925 pesos, down from 5.075 pesos on Friday. Mexican stocks dropped nine-tenths of 1 percent, or 21.42 points, closing at 2,354.24 in light trading.
Mexico's economy was just beginning to recover from a year of stagnation when the peso crisis erupted. A major concern now is how to impose the tight controls needed to restrain inflation without choking off economic growth or causing more social unrest.
Mr. Zedillo promised that with the support of all Mexicans, the sacrifices would be temporary. The emergency plan "will make it possible to achieve as quickly as possible the benefits of the new exchange rate in terms of greater employment and production," said a statement from Mr. Zedillo's office.
The primary thrust of the plan is to whittle down the deficit caused by importing more goods and services than are exported. In 1994, that deficit was around $28 billion, which was covered by foreign capital lured by high interest rates on Government bonds.
Foreign investors eventually found less risky investments, leaving Mexico unable to support the deficit. There was a speculative run on the peso and, after spending more than $10 billion trying to defend it, the Government was forced to allow the currency to float freely.
Mr. Zedillo said that Mexico will have to cut that deficit in half during 1995, mainly by increasing exports and sharply decreasing imports.
The Government said it would improve the conditions for future investments by eliminating excessive regulations. And although the federal budget will have to be reduced, the Government pledged not to cut social programs for the poor.

HEADLINE: Boston N.A.A.C.P. Office Is in Foreclosure

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 2

 BODY:
The nation's oldest chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. is 16 months behind on its mortgage, and the Federal Government, which holds the loan, has foreclosed.
The organization is being run from the house of the chapter president, Jack E. Robinson, and meetings are being held at members' homes and a local community college. 
 The chapter is $20,000 behind on payments to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which provided a low-interest loan for renovation of its headquarters in the mid-1980's.
The chapter was formed in 1910, a year after the National Organization for the Advancement of Colored People was founded. It had been in its current office since the mid-1950's.
"What we're hoping to accomplish is that the minority community and N.A.A.C.P. members will come to the forefront and come up with the necessary funds to take the building out of foreclosure," Mr. Robinson said.
HUD officials were not available for comment today, a holiday. Mr. Robinson said the case had been turned over to an Arlington, Va., collection company.

HEADLINE: Voters Expect Upheaval In Political Landscape

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DENVER, Jan. 2

 BODY:
Not long ago, Bruce Chaffin was a throw-the-bums-out conservative. But he's not cynical about politics anymore.
"It's going to be wonderful," said the 36-year-old sales executive here, almost giddy about the Republicans' taking control of Congress this week. "You bet there's going to be some changes, and I can't wait." 
 But Nicole Avrain wore a pained expression and confessed to a new fondness for term limits. "As a liberal, I'm nervous," said the 24-year-old college student. "Real nervous."
Whether they see the Government becoming leaner, or just plain meaner, American voters of all stripes agree: the road ahead will veer to the right.
"Bill Clinton looks like a wet noodle," said Deshawn Jones, a 31-year-old Denver actor, "and Newt Gingrich is going to swallow him."
From the tobacco fields of rural Virginia to the sleek coffeehouses of San Francisco, and here in maverick Rocky Mountain country, many Americans seem to be eager, even insistent, to see a Republican slash-and-burn attack on a bureaucracy that they say is bloated.
"Let's see a reduction," said Frank Scartozzi, a 32-year-old dentist in Tenafly, N.J. "We all have to manage our budgets; it's time for Congress to manage theirs. This country has got to understand that nothing is on a silver platter."
One issue, repeated so often that nothing else comes close, strikes a raw nerve with the American electorate: welfare. Most of the nearly 70 people interviewed over the weekend said that President Clinton had not delivered on his promise to rein in welfare costs, and that the Republicans seemed more likely to pursue hard-nosed cuts.
"We've got to end the handout mentality in this country," said Tom Raddemann, a 41-year-old computer consultant in Denver who offered himself as proof that government assistance can lead to sloth. "About eight years ago I collected unemployment, and man, I didn't do a thing as long as it lasted. I just sat back, didn't even look for work. But when that sucker ran dry, let me tell you, I got focused in a hurry."
It was a sentiment that seemed to transcend class, race, sex and political affiliation, and it was usually delivered bluntly: the poor did not need a helping hand so much as they needed a swift kick in the pants.
"If you can sit home and have babies and collect more money than you'd get flipping burgers, well, that's what you do," said Isaac White, 42, a marketing executive here. "And believe me, I'm not the only black person getting fed up with it. There's a lot of us starting to vote Republican, even though people don't always admit it. It's obvious a lot of these social programs are doing more harm than good."
To be sure, not all voters are ready to embrace Republicans' welfare proposals, which include allowing states to abolish aid to young mothers. Nor do they all trust Representative Newt Gingrich, the incoming Speaker of the House.
In the view of John Sanford, a 44-year-old Chicagoan, Mr. Gingrich is "an absurd, crazy, anti-poor racist" who "probably believes that poor people should be deported from this country to another planet."
And Dan Dubrey, a 38-year-old Denver construction worker, likened Mr. Gingrich to a medieval king hungry for power. "He wants to gain control by putting fear into the hearts of the people," Mr. Dubrey said. "With him, everything that's wrong in this country is the fault of the little guy, and he just sits up there on his throne, barking orders."
But others, after hearing Mr. Gingrich described in ogre-like terms in various news reports, said they found the onetime Georgia college teacher to be surprisingly affable, even charming.
"The way the media portray him," said Janet Sherman, 46, a Denver homemaker, "you'd think he didn't want to just start up orphanages, but burn them down, too."
Jennifer Smith, 22, who works for a collection agency here, said the surest way for the Republicans to win the hearts of Americans would be through cuts in the tax code. And if the tax cuts do not go through, she added, the voters will discard the new team on Capitol Hill as surely as it dispatched the old crew.
"The mood of the public is pretty clear on taxes and welfare," Ms. Smith said. "And if it goes ignored, they're going to have a revolt on their hands."
Most voters say they fall somewhere in the middle on the political spectrum. Many of them, while favoring the cuts in the Government pledged by the Republicans, nonetheless shrink from what they see as a far-right social agenda on school prayer and hostility to homosexuals.
"On economic issues I like these Republicans, but they scare me on the other stuff, the Christian Coalition stuff," said John McCaffran, 31, a Denver auto mechanic. "I want government out of my face, period. Build the roads, run the military, but otherwise leave me alone."
Among Democrats, some said they relished seeing Republicans on the hot seat for a change, no longer able merely to sling arrows.
"The Republicans will drop the ball, fail miserably and spend the next few years whining and blaming the Democrats," said Greg Theobald, a 44-year-old Chicago lawyer, painting a scenario for Mr. Clinton's re-election.
But most voters, even Democrats, are not eager to see the Republicans fail. "I say, let's give the Republicans a fair chance," said Marcia Smith, 42, a statistician from Green Bay, Wis. "Nothing else seems to have worked."
Indeed, some people who voted for Mr. Clinton and who now express disappointment with him, see the conservative mood of the country as a golden opportunity for the President to reassert himself as a centrist, the sort of New Democrat he said he was in the 1992 campaign.
"This allows Clinton to move to the middle and make some hard choices he couldn't before," said John Duggan, a 27-year-old San Francisco salesman. "He has had to cater too far to the left."
Many voters said they simply wanted the Government to act more like a business, to "downsize" like so many American corporations.
"We have to balance our checkbooks, why not the Government?" said Derek Passarelli, 32, a bank supervisor here. "And I'm a little skeptical that the Republicans are going to be able to cut taxes, increasing spending for the military and somehow balance the budget."
One thing voters are not grousing about much is gridlock. Most Americans see Congress charging hard to the right, with Mr. Clinton close on its heels.
"Things will get done," said Barbara Maloney, a 59-year-old psychotherapist. "I'm just afraid it will be the wrong things."
Or, as Janine Jones, a homemaker in a Denver suburb put it, "What Newt wants, Newt is going to get."

HEADLINE: Knoxville Journal;
Company's Fall Is Dash of Cold Water but Not a Dashing of Hope

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Jan. 1

 BODY:
Across the street from two glass towers built by two banking brothers who went broke in the mid-80's, Jake and C. H. Butcher Jr., sits the emptying shell of the empire that Christopher Whittle built.
Some Knoxvillians call the spot, the corner of Maine and Gay Streets, Ego Intersection. 
 When Mr. Whittle, a media entrepreneur, opened a three-building complex downtown in August 1991, it was to house 2,000 workers and be the headquarters for the burgeoning ventures of Whittle Communications: Channel One, the network that took television newscasts and advertising into schools; Special Reports, a magazine-and-television venture aimed at doctors' offices, and the administrative part of the Edison Project, a grand education experiment to build private schools that would make money.
But as investors began to question the company's finances, Whittle Communications disintegrated through sell-offs and closings, and in the summer Mr. Whittle decamped to his apartment in the Dakota on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and his house in East Hampton, L.I. The Edison Project is the company's lone remaining enterprise, and its finances are shaky.
Now "Whittlesburg" is for sale, a monument to yet another failed effort here to create jobs and broaden the tax base, and the city is learning the cost of dashed expectations.
The asking price for Whittlesburg is reported to be about half its cost of $55 million, which means that taxpayers could lose more than the $7 million that they had put up to finance bonds. The money was to have been repaid as part of property taxes from Whittle.
The "potential taxpayer exposure," Mayor Victor Ashe said, is the most immediate problem. But Knoxville will lose in other ways, as well. The City Ballet received 5 percent of its budget in 1993 from Whittle. The United Way received $56,000 from the company and an equal amount from its employees.
And the Whittle Scholars program at the University of Tennessee, which Mr. Whittle financed, has been halved, to 50 recipients from 100, said Dr. Joseph E. Johnson, the university president.
Whittle has been laying off employees for years, so the economic blow is not as dramatic as it could have been. About 600 jobs have been lost, but that is a small percentage of the 350,000 jobs in the region.
Retailers are feeling the effects, nonetheless, especially in the Old City, a warehouse district that has become an area of restaurants, clubs and shops since the late 80's. The Old City's growth paralleled that of Whittle, and many former Whittle employees say their presence was instrumental in the area's success.
"In 1988 and '89," Jack Neely, who was an editor at Whittle, said, "probably more than half the people in the Old City were Whittle kids."
Frank Snowden, owner of one of the first restaurants in the area, closed a second restaurant in the neighborhood called the Summit Diner. "The collapse of Whittle has been devastating to my business," Mr. Snowden said. "I thought Whittle was going to march down Gay Street and meet up with Old City, rejuvenating the downtown. If I had known they were going to collapse, I would never have opened the Summit Diner."
But Paula Belden, whose furniture and accessory store is a few doors from Mr. Snowden's restaurant, said she was less disturbed. She pointed out that the University of Tennessee campus here had 25,000 students. "Knoxville won't suddenly become uncool without Whittle," she said.
Mayor Ashe sounded a similar note, pointing to "the many talented people Whittle brought who have decided to stay." He added, "That will be a positive, lasting benefit to the community."
Mr. Neely will be staying. He is a freelance writer for Metro Pulse, an alternative newspaper where several former Whittle employees have landed.
Ken Umansky, who moved here from New York City in 1989, will be staying to run a company that he formed with a partner in the summer to develop training programs.
Another former Whittle editor, Martha Hume, and her husband, Chet Flippo, a writer, moved here after 14 years in New York. Ms. Hume, who was born in eastern Kentucky, said she saw a "lasting cosmopolitan influence by the people who were brought here." She and her husband are writing books and plan to remain.
So does Andrew Nelson. He left Whittle, where he was a writer and an editor, when buyouts were offered in 1992 and began working on CD-ROM games with four friends. Their partnership is called Cyberflix, and their first two titles have sold almost 100,000 copies each.
Mr. Nelson calls Whittlesburg "chumps' corners."
A former fact checker, John Yates, had another name for Building 3 in Whittlesburg, where he was the last employee to leave. "I called it the Yates Wing," he said. Mr. Yates worked on the last Whittle publication, The Physician's Weekly, which was sold early last month.
Most of Whittlesburg is deserted now. One prospective buyer is the General Services Administration, which is planning a new Federal courthouse. A spokesman for the agency said on Friday that the agency hoped to decide in 10 days.
The remnants of the Whittle empire continue to occupy parts of Buildings 1 and 2. About 150 workers are left, and most of those work for Channel One, which was sold last summer to K-III Communications Corporation, based in New York. Don Johnston, in charge of liquidating the Whittle concern, oversees operations from his top-floor office.
But most of Whittlesburg is deserted. In one office, a dead ficus tree provides ghostly testimony to its former occupancy. In others, boxes of papers suggest transition. To Mr. Nelson, the abandoned files represent "what may be the saddest thing about the company's failure."
"There are boxes down here," he said, "full of great ideas just moldering."

HEADLINE: Yearning To Breathe Free

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
Without being dour, Lorraine Canoe makes do with life in New York City, but it is not the same. You can find all kinds of things, but the supermarkets do not stock deer meat or boiled corn bread. In no borough are regular Mohawk ceremonies held for each of the year's 13 moons.
"And it's not easy trying to find someone I can talk Mohawk with," she said. 
 This is why, after living in Brooklyn for more than 35 years, Ms. Canoe considers her real home to be Akwesasne, the Mohawk reservation that straddles the border between New York and Canada. She was raised there, and it is only a matter of time before she returns for good to the place where everyone knows her as Kanaratitake, her given and preferred name.
Worshipful of Mohawk traditions but needing to work, the tough-spirited Ms. Canoe, 62, leads the split life of many American Indians transplanted to New York City. She savors the manic dazzle but finds her most resonant pleasure during occasional excursions, and frequent phone calls, back to the reservation.
Thousands of American Indians have moved off reservations into cities and towns across the United States to find jobs. And while many have spent years as high-rise Indians, they often suffer from a culture clash that causes them to yearn for the extended family, open spaces and time-honored ceremonies of their reservations. Those who have chosen New York have found the liabilities particularly pronounced.
"Most tribal customs are to take place on the earth," said Rosemary Richmond, the director of the American Indian Community House, a center that provides services and sponsors cultural events for Indians in New York and is currently marking its 25th year. "There is very little earth in New York City. And most of it is public and restricted. Catholics can go to a Catholic church in any city they move to. Indians have their own ways of worshiping that they can't find anywhere else."
According to the 1990 census, more than 26,000 American Indians live in New York City, nearly triple the number in 1980, making them one of the fastest-growing minorities in the city. And Indian organizations think the census figures undercount the actual population, and estimate it to be about 35,000, with the heaviest concentration in Brooklyn and Queens. New York City's Indians, thought to belong to more than 60 different nations, converge from as far away as Alaska. More Indians live in New York than on any reservation except the Oklahoma land areas and the Navajo reservation, which sprawls across Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. Among cities, only Los Angeles and Oklahoma City have higher Indian populations.
There has not been a true Indian neighborhood in New York since the 1950's and 1960's, when many Indians, principally Mohawks, congregated in downtown Brooklyn because they worked in construction and this was near the union hall. There was also a bar called the Wigwam where many of them drank. Indians have long been strongly represented in the construction industry; while most have a healthy respect for heights, they have a reputation for having little fear. A fair number of New York's Indians still work in construction, though far more are in artistic fields.
Many who come to New York today face difficulty finding work and decent housing. Indian organizations say they have a group unemployment rate of more than 45 percent, and many families live below the poverty level.
The American Indian Community House, in Greenwich Village, hopes to open a hotel within the next few years that will devote a sizable share of its space to housing Indians. The group also offers job counseling and substance abuse counseling, and it serves as a central meeting place where on any given day one is apt to find Senecas and Hopis and Shinnecocks.
Even if gainfully employed, many urban Indians wrestle with their connection to their past. Some want nothing to do with it. The children of one transplant did not even know they were Indians. Others keep up a superficial connection.
But there are many others who are attentive to their traditional customs, and for them, New York can be a lonely and constricting place. They miss the rituals. They are accustomed to open spaces. Animals are a vital part of their way of life. The simple act of going outdoors each day is starkly different from what it is on the reservation.
"People have done ceremonies in Central Park," said Ingrid Washinawatok, who came to New York in 1981 but intends to eventually move back to the Menominee Reservation in Wisconsin. "But Central Park is not truly clean so far as energy. Ceremonies aren't events. They are communications between you and whatever you want to call the creator. That should be done on the reservation."
In many ways, Ms. Canoe is typical of the urban Indian whose heart remains on the reservation. At her second-floor apartment in Sunset Park, Ms. Canoe was cooking and talking and cooing to her 7-month-old grandson -- and she was happy. That was because her daughter, Monica, was visiting from the reservation.
Ms. Canoe, who teaches a course on conquered peoples in America at Hunter College, was especially upbeat because a few weeks earlier she had been to the reservation for the Harvest Ceremony, when the last food is removed from the earth. All boys born during the year are formally named at the ceremony, and her grandson had his name announced: Kaientatiesa.
"New York is very exciting," she said. "But the reservation is my home. The belief system is not the same. My belief system is the ceremonies in the longhouse. Here they go to church or synagogue. It's not the same."
In order to worship, she tries to get to the reservation for as many ceremonies as she can. There, traditional celebrations are held in a large building known as the longhouse. They require a Mohawk water drum with a deerskin top and rattles. On ceremonial occasions, Ms. Canoe puts on fringed and beaded clothes and moccasins. Men wear headdresses boasting three eagle feathers.
Although many Indians on the reservations have assimilated into mainstream American culture and attend Christian churches rather than longhouse ceremonies, Ms. Canoe is fervidly traditional. "That genocidal thought of religion has gotten into their heads," she said of nontraditionalist Indians. "The church is a crutch. It's a white man's religion. They brought it here to conquer us and civilize us."
Ms. Canoe takes the nine-hour bus trip to the reservation for about half of the 13 annual ceremonies, and spends her summer breaks from Hunter there. She owns a house on the reservation, where her two daughters -- Monica, 26, and Sara, 23 -- live. Though both daughters were raised in New York, they moved to the reservation when they became adults. Ms. Canoe intends to retire in four years and settle there, as well.
She accompanied her husband, an ironworker, when he came to Brooklyn to work on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in 1958. The marriage eventually dissolved, but she stayed in the city and married Frank Montoia, a Mexican Indian. He is a window washer.
Not all of New York's food offerings are to Ms. Canoe's tastes, but she improvises. The three "sisters" -- beans, corn and squash -- are the sacred foods that are her staples. She makes her own boiled corn bread. She is not supposed to eat meat, like pork, that comes from an animal that would eat another animal.
She brings one of her favorites -- deer meat -- back from the reservation. She finds that Mexican restaurants serve dishes close to what she customarily eats.
Alcohol, she has come to believe, is something "the white man brought here to make us crazy." Thus she swore off drinking 20 years ago. She even refuses to use wine vinegar or to cook with any form of alcohol.
Another difficulty for urban Indians is that the public perception of them is rarely to their liking. Too often, in their view, it is an erroneous, simple-minded conception of warring heathens. "People say stupid things to us," Ms. Richmond said. "Like, 'Hey, chief,' or 'Do you live in a tepee?' You're always treated as a savage or an alcoholic."
Monica said she moved to the reservation three years ago because she felt incomplete in New York. Her husband, Ron LaFrance, is an audio-visual technician and teaches song and dance on the reservation.
"I've tried being in the city and it wasn't for me," he said. "I just feel more freer. It's not like we're living in a rain forest. But anywhere you go on the reservation, there are trees. I like to look for hawks. That's a little hard in the city."
And life on the reservation is more relaxed. "We have a thing that we call Indian time," Mr. LaFrance said. "If you set a meeting for 8, people will show up at 8:30 or a quarter to 9. It's not a fast-paced life."

HEADLINE: Somalia's Overthrown Dictator, Mohammed Siad Barre, Is Dead

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

 BODY:
Maj. Gen. Mohammed Siad Barre, who was overthrown as President of Somalia in 1991 after ruling that impoverished African country for more than 20 years, died yesterday in exile in Lagos, Nigeria.
Official accounts put his age near 74, but reference books place his birth variously between 1912 and 1920. 
 General Siad Barre's departure from the scene four years ago left Somalia without a central authority, on the brink of mass starvation and with a civil war among feuding clans and their militias.
As commander of the armed forces, he had taken control of Somalia, in the Horn of Africa, in 1969. The country of about nine million -- mostly nomads -- with a per capita income of about $175 a year is one of the most impoverished.
General Siad Barre's rule was marked by a war with Ethiopia, a flip-flop in political alliances from the Soviet Union to the United States, and growing allegations of human rights abuses.
In its final years, his Government steadily lost control of much of the countryside to the chiefs of warring clans, plunging the country into racking social and economic problems. Human rights groups issued reports citing a consistent pattern of political imprisonment, torture, political killings and discrimination against the Isaaks clan.
In May 1986, President Siad Barre was seriously injured in an automobile accident, but later that year he was nominated by the country's sole legal political party for re-election, ran uncontested and won a new seven-year term.
Yet there continued to be questions about the extent of his recovery. Reports of feeble health combined with the country's internal strife led to a weakening of his grasp on power, American officials believed. Toward the end, they said, he was struggling to arrange a succession that would insure that his family and clan -- the Marehan clan -- remained in power.
Many believed he was grooming his son, Maslah, who was a Soviet-trained army general.
Instead, Somalia was steeped in turmoil. United Nations and United States troops partly managed to open relief-supply lines to a famished population, but that costly effort, too, has yet to bring about a political solution and peace to the country.
According to his Government's version, General Siad Barre was born in 1919 or 1921. He was educated in private schools in Mogadishu, the capital, and attended the Military Academy in Italy and School of Administration and Politics in Somalia.
From 1941 to 1960 he served in the Somali Police Force and rose to the rank of chief inspector. In 1960, when the Somali Republic was created out of territories formerly ruled by the Italians and British, he was made a colonel and deputy commandant of the newly formed Somali National Army. He rose to brigadier general in 1962 and major general in 1966.
On Oct. 21, 1969, shortly after the President, Dr. Abdirashid Ali Shermarke, was assassinated by a police officer in a factional quarrel, General Siad Barre led a successful and bloodless coup. Assuming power, he espoused "scientific socialism," arguing there was no inconsistency with the principles of Islam, and turned to the Soviet Union for support.
In 1977, his army invaded the disputed Ogaden area of southeastern Ethiopia. At about the same time, Ethiopia split with the United States and became more closely aligned with the Soviet Union. With the help of Cuban troops and billions of dollars' worth of Soviet weapons, the Ethiopians turned back the Somalis in 1978.
General Siad Barre denounced the Russians and turned to the United States. Somalia received military and economic aid from the United States for a promise of American use of the port of Berbera on the Gulf of Aden. But aid declined drastically as allegations of human rights abuses rose. In 1989, Somalia revived contacts with Libya.
In May 1988, fierce fighting broke out in the north between the Government and rebels who contended they had been discriminated against by the Siad Barre Government and were fighting for a more democratic Government.
A report commissioned by the State Department and made public in September 1989 said the Somali Army "purposely murdered" at least 5,000 unarmed civilians over a 10-month period in the early phases. The Government denied the allegation.
More than 10,000 people were reported killed in the months that followed, with allegations that the Somali military had bombed towns and strafed fleeing residents.
Amnesty International said in August 1988 that since 1981 the Government had used torture and "widespread arbitrary arrests, ill treatment and summary executions" of civilians suspected of collaborating with the rebels.
In his last year in office, President Siad Barre promised reforms to introduce multi-party democracy.
In June 1990, a hundred prominent citizens signed a declaration called the Mogadishu Manifesto, calling for his resignation and the appointment of a transitional government pending free elections.
He called the manifesto "destructive," and jailed 45 of those who had signed it, but about a month later he ordered their release. He agreed to multi-party parliamentary elections to be scheduled in February but later canceled them and the civil war took its course.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1995: THE ECONOMY;
For Top Executives, Fed Is the Only Threat To Blue Skies Ahead

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
Outside the Taco Bell and Dunkin' Donuts shops in the suburbs north of here, help wanted signs are about as common as strip malls. What is perhaps more surprising are the help wanted signs outside the factories.
"Thank you for considering us for employment," reads one sign outside L & L Products, a maker of gaskets and other auto parts. 
 For those industries that had been expected to lead America's industrial decline, these signs are comforting. They reflect not only the speedy burnishing of what was once the Rust Belt but also testify to widespread faith that customers will keep buying and the economy will keep growing.
"It brings a smile to your face," said G. Mustafa Mohatarem, general director of economics for the General Motors Corporation.
Like Mr. Mohatarem, his counterparts at the other auto makers -- indeed, at businesses across the country -- expect the economy to continue expanding through 1995, if at a gentler pace. However, they apply one caveat: The Federal Reserve could overshoot in its effort to mellow the expansion and stop its growth.
If the Fed raises rates further, said Allen Questrom, chairman and chief executive of Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores, "it wouldn't surprise me to see recession in late '95 or early '96."
Some executives said that their businesses would boom as much because of their industry's idiosyncrasies as because of general economic growth. "The computer industry is positioned for strong growth in '95," said Ted Waitte, chief executive of Gateway 2000, a direct-mail computer supplier based in North Sioux City, S.D.
Mr. Waitte cited as support "a lot of things specific to the industry": a strong upgrade cycle because of new software and stiff competition on price. "People are just going to be able to buy much better products than they've ever been able to buy at much better prices than they've ever been able to buy them," he said.
But Mr. Mr. Waitte also pointed to robust consumer confidence, a sentiment heralded by manufacturers and retailers. "The consumer today feels good about the economy, clearly the best she's felt since the 80's," Mr. Questrom said. The auto makers believe that the combination of consumer confidence, pent-up demand and rising employment will provide them with strong sales well into 1997.
In fact, General Motors is convinced the expansion could continue indefinitely. "There's no law of economics that says you have to have a downturn," Mr. Mohatarem said. Since the Government cut spending and raised taxes at the recovery's start, rather than spending more and taxing less, it prevented a boom, Mr. Mohatarem said. Its action also prevented a bust, he added, guaranteeing slower growth of about 2.5 to 3 percent through next year and beyond, with mild inflation of about 3 percent.
Still Mr. Mohatarem said he worried that fiscal stimulus now -- like the tax cuts being considered by leaders of both political parties in Washington -- could ignite a boom and shorten the expansion.
For 1995, G.M. projects that sales of all vehicles in the United States will rise only about 2 percent, to 15.6 million from 15.3 million. The Ford Motor Company predicts industry sales of up to 15.9 million, while the Chrysler Corporation, which was saying last June that sales in 1995 could reach 17 million, has restrained its enthusiasm and now projects about 16.5 million. The previous record, set in 1986, was 16.3 million cars and light and heavy trucks.
Not everyone expresses such faith in the auto market's stamina, however. Asked how long auto sales would remain strong, Koichi Amemiya, president of American Honda Motor Company, laughed, and said, "I also want to know that."
If there is a fear expressed universally by business executives, it is that the Federal Reserve will raise rates too high. "The Fed appears to be trying to slay a dragon that doesn't exist," said Arthur C. Martinez, chairman of the Sears Merchandise Group, the retailing arm of Sears, Roebuck & Company in Chicago. So far, he said, "we see no discernible response by the consumer to what's happened." But he added that the effect of rising rates was hard to ascertain.
Auto executives nervously greeted each of the six interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve last year with the expressed hope that it would be the last. But in each case, after the dust had settled, they said only that the Fed's actions had taken the edge off the expansion without endangering it.
They continue to urge the Fed to go no further. "Clearly, if we were to get another rate increase, at some point it's going to put a damper on consumer confidence," said Edward E. Hagenlocker, president of Ford Automotive Operations.
The absence so far of a clear consumer response to rising rates may simply reflect the lengthy lag between cause and effect. The Fed's increases may not bite until this year's second or third quarter, said Ira Silver, manager of planning and forecasting for J. C. Penney in Dallas.
Mr. Silver said he expected the economy to still be growing at the end of 1995, but at less than 2 percent rate. "I think the Fed will get basically the soft landing they're looking for," he said.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1995: Forecasting 1994 Proved Hazardous;
He Was Close, If for Wrong Reasons...

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Among forecasters of 1994 economic growth, Larry J. Kimball was one of the few who was at least able to get his nose above water. His forecast was almost high enough to match what actually happened.
When he laid out his 1994 projection more than a year ago, Mr. Kimball, director of the Business Forecasting Project at the University of California at Los Angeles, anticipated strong home construction, strong business investment and strong auto sales. All three happened. 
 But the economy did not play out according to Mr. Kimball's outlook, although his forecast -- higher than anyone else's -- came close to the mark.
"I did not foresee the sharp rise in interest rates," Mr. Kimball said. "I saw the Federal Reserve as nudging the rates up only a little."
In fact, if he had been more prescient about the Fed, Mr. Kimball might not have been as optimistic in his 1994 forecast. He would have worried that rising rates would inhibit home construction and auto sales. That had not happened by December.
Mr. Kimball also did not expect the economy to add as many jobs as it did: more than three million in 1994. "It was the new jobs and the new incomes that came with those jobs that propelled the economy upward," he said. "Incomes themselves did not change much."
Another error marred his forecast. Given the low inflation rate, Mr. Kimball thought American companies would have no reason to add much to their stockpiles of merchandise, to beat price increases.
But companies built up their inventories of goods in warehouses and on store shelves anyway, in anticipation of strong sales, at home and abroad.
"I think my biggest numerical mistake was in inventories," Mr. Kimball said. "I just saw sales in line with production, and instead production was stronger than sales."
But Mr. Kimball was lucky. His mistakes offset each other, and the outcome led to his relatively favorable forecast.
He predicted that the gross domestic product, measuring the value of all of the nation's goods and services, would grow by 3.7 percent in calendar 1994. That was the highest estimate submitted by any of the 50 prominent forecasters surveyed in December 1993 by Blue Chip Economic Indicators.
Still, Mr. Kimball was not bullish enough. While the final quarter's results are not yet in, it appears all but certain that the economy grew by about 4 percent last year.
For the first time, none of the forecasters in the Blue Chip survey submitted a prediction that was greater than what happened. The forecasts ranged from Mr. Kimball's 3.7 percent down to 1.7 percent, with the average at 2.9 percent.
The Clinton Administration was an encouraging factor in Mr. Kimball's forecast. "Their policies were pro-business," he said. "Their biggest risk, as Democrats, was that they would be budget busters. Clinton avoided that by reducing the deficit."
Indeed, in Mr. Kimball's view, Mr. Clinton's deficit reduction program, enacted in 1993, "set the stage for a sound expansion, with 1994 likely to be the strongest year."
This year is another matter.
The Kimball forecast for this calendar year is economic growth of 3.2 percent. Ten other forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip are more optimistic.
What colors Mr. Kimball's view of 1995 are interest rates and the Federal Reserve. Mr. Kimball thinks the Fed will try to slow the economy and raise the unemployment rate from the present 5.6 percent to 6 percent. In theory, at least, that would lessen inflationary pressures by making it harder for workers to bid up wages.
But he acknowledges that his crystal ball might be cloudy.
"What would get in the way of slowing the economy," Mr. Kimball said, "would be a big, stimulative middle-income tax cut that was not offset by spending cuts."

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1995: THE ECONOMY;
Some Economists Look Into the New Year

 BODY:
Statistics will probably show that the economy throttled back at the end of 1994 to about the 2.5 percent growth rate that the Federal Reserve and most private analysts had considered sustainable. Growth and consumer inflation figures below are from a review, fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter. Unemployment figures are fourth-quarter averages. Job growth figures are from interviews. Ms. Tyson was willing to speak only in general terms pending a White House forecast due in February.
 
Nicholas S. Perna, chief economist, Shawmut National Corp., Boston
 
 Growth 2.9 percent Lagged effect of higher interest rates takes hold with an outside chance of "serious" slowdown in the second half of the year
 
 Unemployment, Job Growth 6.0 percent, 1.75 million jobs This is the job growth that is consistent with Federal Reserve's presumed G.D.P. target of 2.5 percent
 
 Inflation 3.5 percent Prices accelerating a bit but from very low base and wage costs, the dominant factor, still well controlled. Many fears are misplaced inflation could well be less than 3.5.
 
 Interest rates 7.20 percent Decline reflects growing confidence that growth is slowing, shrinking inflation premium. There's considerable room for long-term yields to come down so long as inflation is tamed. Short-term rates peak at about 6.25 percent
 
 Uncertainties, Mainly from Washington. Fed, which has said it would err of side of restraint, could underestimate impact of moves already in the pipeline and tighten monetary policy too much. Tax-cut fever could get out of hand.
 
John O. Wilson, executive vice president and chief economist Bank of America, San Francisco
 
 Growth 2.5 percent Economy will be slowing rapidly at yearend on the way to a much weaker 1996, as soft-landing again eludes policymakers
 
 Unemployment, Job Growth 5.3 %, 2.8 million jobs Dropouts from the labor force will help keep the unemployment rate low. Job growth in California, where recovery has lagged, set to accelerate
 
 Inflation 3.3 percent More bottlenecks will emerge and wage pressures will show up in the factory-intensive Midwest. Oil prices likely to rise.
 
 Interest rates 8.3 percent Inflation pressures and fiscal debate push bond rates up. Overnight rates up to 6 1/2-7 percent.
 
 Uncertainties Tax changes won't be made in time to directly affect the 1995 economy but a nnervous bond market could stumble from a bidding war over cuts, thereby undermining confidence.
 
Howard Keen Jr. Chief economist, Conrail, Philadelphia.
 
Growth 2.4 percent. To restrain growth, the Fed keeps raising interest rates until slowdown is evident, probably in early spring.
 
Unemployment, Job Growth 6.0 percent. 2.2 million jobs. Jobless rate edges up as corporations maintain pressure to keep their production costs down.
 
Inflation 3.2 percent. No convincing evidence so far of a "new era" for inflation, but complacency could prove to be dangerous.
 
Interest rates 7.9 percent. Long-term rates fairly flat despite lower capital spending by business. Short-term rates may rise as much as a full percentage point before peaking.
 
Uncertainties, Resiliency of financial markets and consumers to further increases in short-term interest rates. Whether auto producers can meet production schedules.
 
M. Kathryn Eickhoff, president Eickhoff Economics, New York
 
 Growth 3.0 percent With the consumer pulling back and housing a modest depressant, economy should slow markedly by the second quarter and manage as little as 2 percent rate of expansion in the second half.
 
 Unemployment, Job Growth 2.6 million jobs, 5.4 percent Because of more potential workers than many think, jobless rate could get as low as 5 percent without wages causing faster inflation
 
 Inflation 3.3 percent With companies having gotten a grip on health care costs, wages could rise as much as 4 percent, which managers get, before meeting stiff resistance
 
 Interest rates 8.5 percent Short rates should peak around 6 1/2 percent
 
 Uncertainties, Fed could be forced to overtighten in second half, which could tip economy into recession. Derivatives pose risk to the banking system.
 
Laura D'Andrea Tyson Chairwoman, Council of Economic Advisers, Washington
 
 Growth 2.7 percent Moderating from surprisingly robust 1994 as impact of interest rate increases spreads beyond housing to dampen consumer and business spending. But recovery abroad should buoy exports.
 
 Unemployment, Job Growth 2.3 million jobs 6.2 percent Job creation should post solid gains but unemployment rate, already well under 6 percent, is likely to creep higher.
 
Inflation 3.2 percent A small rise as wages remain in check under discipline of global competition.
 
Interest rates. Doesn't forecast 30-year bond. Administration's midsession review in July assumed 10-year Treasury notes will average 7 percent in 1995.

A Lingering Unease Despite Strong Growth

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
RARELY since World War II have the world's most powerful economies surged forward so successfully at one time. And rarely have their citizens been so worried that the good times are about to end before they get a share of the bounty.
In the United States, economic growth was the best in a decade, yet that did nothing to help Bill Clinton avoid the revenge of the middle class that led to the first Congress in 40 years controlled entirely by Republicans. In Europe, even though prosperity is returning after a painful recession that sent the jobless rate back into double digits, Helmut Kohl held on to power in Germany only by his fingertips, John Major seems on his last legs in Britain, France is turning inward and Italy has returned to its perpetual state of political chaos. 
 Meanwhile, from Los Angeles to Berlin, the rise in economic output has done little to dampen xenophobia, whether the concern is an influx of Mexicans or Eastern Europeans.
In Asia, Japan is finally seeing the end of a grueling recession that destroyed the national sense of confidence -- some would say arrogance -- that Tokyo had invented a recession-proof form of capitalism that would trump all Western versions. Few think that today: Where just three years ago more than half the country thought Japan would be the world's premier economic power in the next century, now only 25 percent think so.
It is hard to put a finger on why everyone seems so jittery at a time when celebration seems more in order. Perhaps this will turn out to be just a passing bout of economic angst. But that seems unlikely.
Some at the White House blame their problems on the stagnation of real wages in the United States, a 20-year-long phenomenon that has left ordinary workers convinced that economic upturns benefit everyone but them. But that is only a partial explanation and does little to account for the mood elsewhere. A more far-reaching explanation lies in the fact that the global economy is being profoundly reordered, with countries most people still label "developing" expected to account for 40 percent of the world's output early in the next century. That raises fears, whether rightly or wrongly, that the high living standards of the industrial world will be eroded by cheap labor in Asia and Latin America.
Whatever the cause, edginess -- on both a personal and a national scale -- seems bound to worsen if, as seems likely , the world's biggest economies drift out of sync this year. The most probable outcome is a slowdown in the American economy, as the drumbeat of interest-rate increases orchestrated last year by the Federal Reserve finally hits home.
"It's not a question of whether the U.S. will slow down, but when and how much," said David Hale, the chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. "The next issue will be how much that will take the steam out of other recoveries around the world."
A lot rides on how that slowdown is managed, starting with Bill Clinton's chances for re-election in 1996. The White House is haunted by the experience of George Bush, who might have been re-elected had the economy improved earlier. Abroad, an American economy moving ahead at a slower pace is all it takes to raise tensions with economic competitors, particularly Japan. In the post-cold war era those tensions are more visible and potentially more volatile than ever. Meanwhile, China, once dealt with so gingerly by American policy makers, is now being viewed as more and more of an economic menace, with a trade surplus with the United States that has grown to $30 billion.
"These are the countries that are a lightning rod for Americans worried about change, or about their own futures, and so they are potentially a big political problem," said Jeffrey E. Garten, the Undersecretary of Commerce for international trade and the author a few years ago of a book that was presciently titled "A Cold Peace."
President Clinton's strategy for allaying those worries is to convince the country that the new era of freer trade he has promoted so successfully in the last year will ultimately benefit American workers far more than it will hurt them. That was the underlying argument for the North American Free Trade Agreement when it was adopted a year ago, and it resurfaced during the Congressional battle this fall over revising the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Atop these victories, Mr. Clinton traveled to Indonesia to press for an Asian free trade zone, then zipped to Miami to win approval of a parallel zone that will stretch from Tierra del Fuego, at the southern tip of Argentina, to Alaska.
It is an ambitious vision, and it may well prove to be Mr. Clinton's greatest foreign policy legacy. Frustrated by two years of bilateral trade talks with Japan that yielded little, the Administration has turned attention to the tantalizing big emerging markets that only a few years ago were barely on the radar screen. Those markets are hard to define, but most of them have fast economic growth -- Brazil, China, even India and Poland -- and an insatiable demand for imports to build everything from phone systems to software houses. These big emerging markets are expected to increase imports by $972 billion between 1990 and 2010, while the world's industrialized countries will likely increase their imports by $658 billion, according to estimates by the Commerce Department. But if anyone is tempted to conclude that the enthusiastic talk about free trade means a gradual end to the national and regional boundaries that have been used for centuries to keep rich and poor apart, think again.
For a taste of where the world is going, just look at the world's newest economic arbiter created by the new GATT deal -- the World Trade Organization. The organization is supposed to enforce the global trade accord and press for new openings around the world. But when it came into existence two days ago it was still without a director general. The Europeans, the Americans and the Asians are all sponsoring different candidates, and no one wants to give in. The result is an inauspicious start for the organization dedicated to world harmony through trade.
Behind the standoff lie three very different visions of the future of the world economy.
The Europeans would like to create the world trading system in their image, promoting free markets but willing to subordinate them, when necessary, to programs that place social welfare or regional interests ahead of unfettered capitalism. The Americas, under the flag of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the best-known candidate to lead the organization, is pressing an agenda of deregulation, deregulation and more deregulation, though his chances are not likely to be helped by the recent debacle with the peso. And the Asians, fronting a little-known South Korean candidate, want to promote their own model of economic development: state capitalism, where the government invests heavily in business enterprises and often engages in detailed industrial policy while political dissent is subordinated to the demands of national development.
For the United States, like it or not, this is the new stuff of foreign policy. Picking a head for the trade organization hardly has the grip of stopping the destruction in Bosnia or the clarity of preventing North Korea from getting the bomb.
But as President Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, said recently: "What we are doing now is setting the ground rules for the next century. If it looks messy and complicated, that's because it is."

2 Games for Fed Watchers: Waiting and Guessing

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
By the middle of 1995, either a lot of professional economists or a lot of bond traders and investors will be very, very embarrassed.
The consensus of traders and investors, as shown by prices in bond and futures markets, is that the Federal Reserve will push overnight interest rates up to 7 1/2 percent by June, from 5 1/2 percent now. But economic forecasters are much less gloomy; one recent survey found that blue-chip forecasters' average estimate was for overnight rates of just 6.1 percent for the second quarter. 
 "Somebody's very right, somebody's very wrong," said David C. Munro, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a New York consulting company.
Who is right will depend on the Fed's willingness to raise interest rates again next spring without waiting for its six interest rate increases of 1994 to take effect fully. The Fed's goal is to slow the economy and forestall inflationary shortages of raw materials and skilled workers.
Higher interest rates affect the economy gradually, over six months to two years. If companies decide today that they must cut back on borrowing, their canceled orders will slowly trickle back to factories, which will gradually trim output and hiring.
Economists and traders can both cite recent comments by top Fed officials to justify their opposite views on whether the Fed will wait or act again.
Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has sounded the most confident that the Fed has done enough. He said at a news conference on Dec. 9 that although the economy had expanded 4.4 percent over the 12 months ended in September, growth would slow in the next year to between 2 1/2 percent and 2 3/4 percent.
Most Fed officials believe that with the economy already operating at full tilt, with factories full and unemployment low, further growth of 3 percent or more would be inflationary. So Mr. Blinder's comment that growth would slow -- coupled with other comments he made that most of the effect of the 1994 interest rate increases had not yet been felt -- suggested a reluctance to raise rates further.
Some outsiders echo Mr. Blinder's views. "The wise thing for them to do is to wait and see how things turn out," said Andrew F. Brimmer, a former governor of the Federal Reserve Board.
Another reason to think the central bank will be less aggressive in raising rates this year than last is the shift among the voting members of the Fed's top interest rate panel, the Federal Open Market Committee.
The presidents of four regional Federal Reserve banks rotated off the panel on Jan. 1, and three of them were leaders in the move toward higher interest rates last year. Only one of their replacements -- Thomas C. Melzer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -- has a reputation as someone who will push strongly for higher rates at the committee's eight meetings this year.
While Mr. Blinder played down the importance of the turnover, Manuel H. Johnson, one of his predecessors as vice chairman, said that it could make a difference.
Still, there are many traders who expect that rates will continue to rise. They can point to remarks by Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on Dec. 7. "There is very little evidence throughout this economy of any degree of slowdown," he said.
While Mr. Blinder emphasized that consumer inflation has been low, Mr. Greenspan warned that this might not be true for long. Raw material prices have been rising, and so have prices for so-called intermediate goods like flour that are used in making finished goods like bread.
According to the Labor Department, the prices that producers charge for finished goods rose half a percentage point in November, the most recent month available. But raw material prices rose a full 1 percent, and intermediate goods 1.1 percent.
Susan M. Phillips, a Fed governor, said in an interview last autumn that these increases in raw material and intermediate good prices have not shown up in consumer price inflation yet because labor cost increases were small. Labor accounts for at least two-thirds of the cost of finished goods.
One of the key questions for Fed officials has been whether labor costs will continue to stay low, even as unemployment has fallen to 5.6 percent. That level has been associated in the past with shortages of some types of skilled workers as well as rising labor costs.
Improving productivity -- meaning each worker produces more goods in the same amount of time -- helped hold down companies' labor costs last year, as did small increases in wages.
Sending a strong message that inflation will stay low is especially important to the Federal Reserve now because many big labor union contracts are up for negotiation. Central bankers do not want to see large wage increases granted by companies or state and local governments on the assumption that higher labor costs can readily be passed on to consumers or taxpayers.
The Labor Department has calculated that bargaining will be under way for 42 percent of all contracts covering at least 1,000 workers, the highest percentage since the department began calculating such figures 11 years ago.
Although the 3.4 million workers covered by collective bargaining this year account for only 3 percent of the nation's work force, they tend to exert a disproportionate influence on wages.
Few changes in the economy would be as likely to provoke the Fed into further interest rate increases as a sharp rise in wages not offset by rising productivity. Yet few experts think it likely. The shrinkage of American companies and the expanded use of high-technology devices to replace jobs have made workers more reluctant to demand higher pay.
If wages do not rise quickly, and the economy does begin to slow, then traders betting on overnight interest rates of 7 1/2 percent could be proved wrong. "I think 6 could very well be the top," Mr. Munro said, "but many in the market have much higher expectations and could be disappointed."

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1995: THE ECONOMY;
In G.O.P. Plans, a World of Change

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
From Madison Avenue image-meisters to West Coast petrochemical producers, from mutual fund operators in Boston to cigarette makers in Virginia and the Carolinas, American business has a lot riding on the new Republican leadership that will take control of Congress this year.
The "Contract With America," the House Republican statement of policy priorities drafted before the election that gave the G.O.P. control of Congress for the first time in 40 years, sets out the early agenda. It calls for sweeping changes in the handling of business lawsuits, substantial tax reductions for capital gains, new incentives to spur investment by industry, additional tax cuts for individuals who put aside savings and curbs on the Federal regulatory burden. 
 But just as important as what Congress does, industry leaders and lobbyists caution, is what it leaves undone. And in some areas, they are still puzzling over just how the fine print in the G.O.P. contract would affect them in real life.
"Take 'tax code reform,' " said Wally Snyder, president of the American Advertising Federation, an umbrella organization of advertising firms and professionals. Under that rubric, eliminating advertising from the roster of deductible business expenses "might be seen by some as a way to bring in more money," Mr. Snyder said. "That's why we're putting so much emphasis on educating this new group of members of Congress," he added. "We're taking no chances."
A host of industries are likely to be affected by the changes on Capitol Hill. These are among the highlights:
*For Wall Street, says Marc Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Association, the industry's trade association, there are several areas worthy of attention. All financial services firms, especially mutual fund managers and marketers, stand to benefit if Congress widens the availability of individual retirement accounts and makes them more attractive. Investment banking firms would be big winners if the new Congress promotes business capital investment and rescinds rules requiring early disclosure of plant closings caused by takeovers or mergers. Wall Street also sees a lower capital gains tax as encouraging investment, and thus spurring commissions. But other high-priority proposals affecting the financial markets are not so easy to call: The Glass-Steagall Act, which restricts certain securities activities by banks, is certain to undergo changes, but bankers and brokers are at odds over the most likely outcome. Similarly, several new Congressional leaders support freer trade in financial services, but Wall Street is unsure what it would have to offer to foreigners in return for access to their markets.
*The banking industry, apart from the Glass-Steagall issue, will be looking to the new Congress to rein in the Justice Department's aggressive efforts to enforce the Community Reinvestment Act's fair-lending provisons, industry analysts said.
*The insurance industry is paying attention to two big issues. Most important is the revision of the Superfund law, which determines liability for cleaning up industrial waste sites. It died in Congress last year. There is also the long-simmering debate over whether insurers should be subject to Federal, rather than state, supervision. Insurers, even more than most other businesses, also stand to gain from the far-reaching changes proposed to make it more difficult to sue for damages since they are frequently the "deep pocket" of last resort in product liability cases and other similar lawsuits.
*The petrochemical industry and many heavy manufacturers, while sharing the insurance industry's interest in the fate of the Superfund, will also be looking for a more sympathetic handling of various pollution control laws that in industry's view impose an unfair burden on manufacturers.
*Agribusiness fears the budget ax, which could finally chop away at a lot of Depression-era farm programs. Still, the industry has well-placed allies among the newly powerful Republicans, from Thomas J. Bliley Jr., a Virginia tobacco belt loyalist who will head the House Commerce Committee, to Senator Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, a wealthy hog farmer friendly to the pork industry.
*Consumer products companies are generally optimistic about the change in leadership, especially cigarette manufacturers, which endured last year's Congressional hearings on the health risks of tobacco. The new commitment to reducing the burden of regulation may also help consumer products companies resolve troublesome conflicts between the labeling and advertising rules of the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration, executives said.
Broadly speaking, many business leaders believe that agencies like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration will be reined in by the new Congress. They may be too optimistic about that, but, at the very least, it will probably be much harder for agencies in the executive branch to impose new rules on business without a big fight on Capitol Hill.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1995: Forecasting 1994 Proved Hazardous;
...But He Was Way Too Low

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
None of the nation's most prominent forecasters was more pessimistic about what 1994 would bring for the American economy than Irwin L. Kellner, senior economic adviser at Chemical Bank. "Everything pointed to weakness," he recalled recently.
Mr. Kellner said he thought a year ago that the Clinton tax increase for the wealthy would inhibit spending among the rich, and that would have a ripple effect on the less affluent. Neither happened. 
 Mr. Kellner also thought low inflation would hold back spending. After all, why hurry to buy to beat price increases if none is on the horizon? People bought anyway. And he never dreamed that the money many homeowners saved by refinancing their mortgages would be spent so lavishly on consumer goods.
In retrospect, Mr. Kellner said, he underestimated the power of low interest rates and plentiful credit, not to mention the pent-up demand for new cars and the cleverness of the auto manufacturers in designing leasing plans to move cars from showrooms to the nation's garages.
Finally, European economies recovered more strongly than Mr. Kellner had expected. As a result, Europeans bought ever larger quantities of American goods. A weak dollar helped by making United States goods more competitive in price.
"In sum, whatever could converge to boost the economy in 1994 converged, including the California earthquake, which resulted in billions of dollars in spending for reconstruction," he said. "But anyone who was right about the economy in 1994 was right for the wrong reason. We were wrong for the right reasons."
Mr. Kellner, who is, as he puts it, "always on the lookout for what could upset the apple cart," decided a year ago that 1994 would produce a rise in the nation's output of goods and services of only 1.7 percent. Among the 50 forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators in December 1993, his estimate of the growth in gross domestic product was the lowest. Even the most optimistic forecasters, however, fell short of the approximately 4 percent that has turned out to be the actual growth rate in calendar 1994.
The average forecast of 2.9 percent growth was way off the mark as well. But the Blue Chip forecasters, as a whole, were much closer to the actual 2.6 percent inflation rate this year. Mr. Kellner gave the low-ball estimate there too: 1.5 percent.
None of the forecasters expected the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as much as it did.
The expectation that jobs and incomes would stagnate shaped Mr. Kellner's thinking. This has been a successful theme of his for years. Like a modern-day Cassandra, Mr. Kellner was almost alone in the late 1980's in forecasting the recession that finally appeared in the summer of 1990. And that summer, Mr. Kellner was among the first to recognize that a recession had begun. He urged the Federal Reserve to ease up on interest rates, which it finally did in the early fall.
"For the first year of this recovery, employment declined and the unemployment rate kept rising," he said. "I was impressed with the lack of job creation in 1992 and 1993, and I was also impressed with the low quality of pay. But people are sophisticated; they have found offsets, although one wonders how long they can continue to do so."
All of which brings Mr. Kellner to 1995. His forecast is for economic growth of 2.5 percent to 3 percent, which puts him close to the consensus forecast of 2.9 percent in the Blue Chip survey.
"The economy has a lot of momentum," Mr. Kellner said, "and we don't think the Federal Reserve will create a recession by raising interest rates too much. In this case, we are optimistic in our forecast that the Fed can engineer a slowdown."

HEADLINE: Officially, Crime Is Dropping, But Brooklyn Is Still Worried

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
The official police statistics show there has been a double-digit decrease in crime in the last year in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn, with fewer rapes, robberies and car thefts. But the standard scene outside Nereida Rodriguez's apartment window has not changed much. Men deal drugs. Groups of youths, exchanging the handshakes that identify them as gang members, hang out on the street corner. The sirens of police cars and ambulances scream regularly.
"My 5-year-old son sits in that window, in the morning and at night, and he asks me what those people are doing -- if they are bad, if they are going to hurt us," said Ms. Rodriguez, whose apartment looks out on Fifth Avenue. "I try to answer him as best I can. But I don't know." 
 Betty McClosky, who moved to 63d Street in Sunset Park in 1945, shook her head sadly when asked if the numbers translate into a greater sense of safety.
"For heaven's sake, I had my Thanksgiving decorations -- pictures of turkeys -- stolen," she said. "There are flowers on the sidewalk around the block where a man was murdered a couple of weeks ago. No, I won't go out at night. Fifth Avenue is a disaster -- garbage and gangs. And if I saw anything wrong going on, I wouldn't report it. Never, never, never. And why? Fear."
As in urban neighborhoods everywhere that have long been plagued by the dual epidemics of drugs and violence, community leaders and residents of Sunset Park say the distance between the reality of their lives and the numbers put out by the Police Department offer a telling example of the sometimes limited meaning and impact of crime statistics.
They believe the numbers are reflective of demographic trends set in motion years ago. They suspect the statistics might be far from entirely accurate, with the neighborhood's ever-increasing population of immigrants typically declining to even report crimes.
They also worry that even if the numbers are accurate, they could could well go up soon, and fast, as youth gangs proliferate and budget cuts eliminate social service programs for the neighborhood's young and poor residents. Just in the last three years the number of youth gangs in Sunset Park has gone from 4 to 25.
"A lot of people here have given up on believing numbers," said Joan Griffin McCabe, the City Councilwoman who represents Sunset Park, a working-class neighborhood populated largely by people of Hispanic and Asian descent. "An incredible fear of reporting crime exists here. I think the numbers are misleading, and I think they will come back to haunt the Mayor. We'll see where the numbers go once the youth programs and the adult literacy programs the Mayor wants yanked are gone."
There is, then, no shortage of unease on the streets on Sunset Park. While problems with street prostitution and street drug dealing have been tackled more effectively lately, some blocks remain off-limits to many residents. With gangs recruiting new members from the neighborhood's junior high schools, both students and parents suffer from a sense of vulnerability and danger poorly captured by official statistics.
And because teen-agers are carrying out much of the mayhem, there is the worry that crimes, even if they occur less frequently, can be more arbitrarily violent. Indeed, though reported robberies dropped by more than 24 percent in 1994 and car thefts fell by nearly 12 percent, shootings in the 72d Precinct were up 30 percent, and violent assaults increased by nearly 4 percent. In Sunset Park, 40 percent of the population is under the age of 18.
"I have got so tired of hearing about statistics," said one 32-year-old mother of three who has spent her entire life in Sunset Park, but asked that she remain anonymous. "What we hear are gunshots -- gunshots at 7:30 in the morning as we put clothes on our children."
Much of the gunfire has been linked to youth gangs, whose numbers, the police say, are multiplying monthly and whose names seem to change almost weekly. There are the Latin Kings, the Netas, Dominicans Don't Play, Gunset, Roughneck Soldiers and United To Crime.
They intimidate crime victims from reporting crimes by stationing a prominent and feared gang member outside the precinct house after another member has been arrested. They stash their guns in bodegas and safe houses until they are needed. They rob mostly immigrants, chiefly the Asian residents who dominate Eighth Avenue and who almost never report the crimes.
"You look at these children, and it is an eerie feeling you get because they almost appear brainwashed," said Hermenia Ramos-Donovan, the director of the Hispanic Young People's Alternative, a social services youth program in Sunset Park.
"The gangs are able to draw in young kids who are vulnerable, and the rest of the neighborhood lives in fear. People will walk down only certain blocks or go completely around specific street corners."
In late December, a 16-year-old and a 22-year-old were shot several times in a confrontation at a Sunset Park subway station. Although both survived, they have declined to cooperate with investigators and will not identify their attackers. Law enforcement officials now say the shooting involved members of two Mexican gangs, and that the victims feared further harm.
"The gangs come to you and tell you they are about Latino pride and the people rising up," said Cindy Rosario, a 19-year-old who rejected a recent offer to join the Latin Queens. "But they are about power. They rob. They slice kids up. They beat members until they bleed if they want to. And if you go to the police, you are dead. That's life."
There are certain aspects about recent life in Sunset Park that most everyone, from the police to the youths to the social service professionals, agrees on.
The officers at the 72d Precinct, empowered by Police Commissioner William J. Bratton's strategy of returning wide-ranging enforcement authority back to the precincts, have become more aggressive and effective. Instead of having to turn over narcotics, prostitution and auto theft investigations to citywide task forces as they had to for years, the officers and detectives can now use their own intelligence to gain their own search warrants to execute their own raids.
"We were the model precinct for community policing, and so we have always been innovative here," said Sgt. Louis Savelli, who directs the precinct's anticrime unit. "But we were held back by our superiors in the department. We were punished or regarded with suspicion for being aggressive.
"The fear was of corruption, and so we were radicals, zealots, crazy," Sergeant Savelli said. "Now, it's a two-way street. The Commissioner has given us the tools to be aggressive. Now, it's community policing with enforcement. Of course, it's going to take a while for the perception that Sunset Park is safer to take hold. The real level of fear at the moment is hard to measure."
It is not tough to gauge for Sister Mary Paul, the director of the Center for Family Life in Sunset Park, which runs after-school, job-training and foster care programs. She said that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's efforts to cut the city budget have eliminated $ 1.3 million that dozens of organizations had relied on and that the rise of youth gangs had threatened to undo a decade of progress in fighting unemployment, crime and infant mortality.
"Sunset Park fought against blight, but I'm afraid we're going to lose what we've gained," Sister Mary Paul said. "The gangs are making appeals to nationalistic loyalty, dividing up the streets that way. It feels almost like Europe, with its ethnic factions. There is fear and anxiety that it is going to get out of control."
Sgt. Ken Corey heads a three-member unit designed to maintain control over the youth gangs of Sunset Park, and he talks enthusiastically about the substantial number of gang arrests his unit has made in recent months. A group of 25 Latin Kings, he said, were arrested one night this fall, another 37 were taken in as part of a subsequent sweep, and his unit is developing a data base of gang intelligence.
"The gangs here are not as bad as they are in other cities, but they are prone to violence," Sergeant Corey said. "Our policy is zero tolerance. But we have to have the help of the people. We have arrests where we turn around on the street and no longer have a victim. He or she has vanished. Look, people are afraid of reporting. I understand."
Paul Mak, one of the leaders of the Chinese-American Association of Sunset Park, concurs. Chinese immigrants, 65,000 of whom live in adjacent parts of Sunset Park, Borough Park and Bay Ridge, are often victimized by stickup gangs as they walk home from the subway station at 62d Street and Eighth Avenue.
"There may be no record at the 72d Precinct of these robberies," Mr. Mak said, "but they are happening, happening bad."
The police concede that a lot of crime in Sunset Park goes unreported, that the gang problem has to be halted quickly, that reduced crime statistics can be interpreted as a hollow boast.
"Look, there is some truth to the notion that numbers can mean whatever you want them to mean," said Capt. Thomas J. Palazzo, the commanding officer of the precinct. "But is Sunset Park safer? I think it is. But whatever we're doing is going to be affected by what's going on with the rest of the criminal justice system -- courts, prisons. What we're doing could be for naught."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 4, 1995, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
A chart yesterday about crime in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn misstated the number of arrests in the 72d Precinct for 1993 and 1994 and the percentage change. In the first 50 weeks of 1994, there were 4,540 arrests (not 7,095); in 1993, there were 4,174 arrests (not 5,820). Thus the increase was 8.8 percent, not 21.9.

 Among the many fhisft in crime over the past decade - a time when overall crime rose sharply from 1985 to 1990 and then began falling - one of the most notable is a dispersion of crime from poorer neighborhoods to affluent ones. This can be seen by grouping statistics according to the income levels of the neighborhood.* JOSH BARBANEL

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1995: Global Economic Prospects Are Brighter for Most;
Mexico Heads Back To the Drawing Board

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DEPALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
Economic prospects around the world look better this year than last. The decision by several large countries to sell off Government-controlled industries is one big engine of growth. Yet deficits, inflation and joblessness keep hampering the pace of recovery in many countries.
For many nations, 1994 was a turnaround year as they began pulling out of recession. Some of the hottest economies, and targets of foreign investment, emerged in once-overlooked markets of Southeast Asia and Latin America. 
 China, a favored destination for foreign investment, slowed down its unrelenting growth last year to 11 percent, a still-formidable rate that strained the capacity of aging industries and power grids. Japan, no longer the growth model for Asia, tried to climb out of its prolonged slump, with growth of barely 1 percent in 1994.
Political developments rattled countries like Mexico, where the peso plummeted after being freed to float against the dollar. Eastern Europe continued to slough off old Communist habits. But in Russia, the best economic news may have been that growth dropped off only 8 percent in 1994, compared with double-digit declines in the previous two years.
Trade liberalization became an international byword, notably with the North American Free Trade Association, now a year old. But frontier barriers were also lowered within Europe and Latin America, even as Washington's trade frictions with Japan and China festered. The European Union expanded to 15 countries. And the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade transformed itself into a sleeker new World Trade Organization.
For Mexico, 1994 should have been a year to remember. Instead, almost everyone would just as soon forget it. Expectations were dashed from the very first when, instead of entering triumphantly into the North American Free Trade Agreement and the club of developed nations that membership had come to represent, Mexico looked down the barrel of a rebel's gun in the southern state of Chiapas.
The disappointments continued throughout the year and hit bottom the week before Christmas with a clumsy forced devaluation of the peso that cost investors in the United States and Mexico billions of dollars overnight.
The expected economic lift that was to have come from the trade pact never really materialized, and the Mexican stock exchange ended the year well below the 3,000 level that optimistic financial analysts had predicted. Mexican exports to the United States increased over the year, but so did imports from north of the border. Mergers and acquisitions of Mexican businesses by bigger companies in the United States and elsewhere meant that many Mexicans, from executives to line workers, lost their jobs.
The new President, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, is a Yale-trained economist whose beliefs in the open market will be tested as he tries to rebuild Mexico's collapsed economic strategy. He closed the year by bringing another economist educated at Stanford, Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, as his new Finance Minister after the old one, Jaime Serra Puche, resigned following his erratic performance during the peso's slide.
The official Government targets for 1995 are a tidy 4 percent growth and 4 percent inflation, with a balanced budget and increased social spending. But after the devaluation, the Government had to go back to the drawing board and start over. Even officials ended the year without any clear idea of what would happen in 1995.
The nightmare of 1994 has not ended, especially after the devaluation. The Zapatista uprising in Chiapas is still unresolved, unemployment is still high and uncertainty remains a constant. The hopes for Mexico's getting an investment-grade rating any time soon have all but disappeared. The Standard & Poor's rating service, which some analysts had thought would promote Mexico to investment grade in 1994, ended the year by putting Mexican foreign debt on a credit watch.
The other political shocks last year -- two assassinations, post-election unrest, kidnappings and infighting within the ruling Party of Revolutionary Institutions -- also took their toll as did interest rate increases in the United States that drained investor money from Mexico.
But many investors stuck with Mexico anyway, realizing that the ability of the country to continue even after such shocks was a sign that its financial institutions functioned well, even if its political institutions did not.
The first order of business in 1995 will be to regain their confidence. ANTHONY DePALMA

Rockefeller Center for Sale? Can I Charge It?
If the Brooklyn Bridge really were for sale, there'd be no shortage of buyers -- and they wouldn't ask plodding questions about cash flow or traffic flow. They'd say, "Wow! I'd own the Brooklyn Bridge!" It's called the "trophy property" syndrome, seen everywhere from Donald Trump's buying the Plaza to a Japanese company's buying Rockefeller Center. That latter purchase did not turn out too well: when Mitsubishi Estate bought control from the Rockefeller family in 1989, it took on a $1.3 billion mortgage. It knew rents wouldn't be enough, but assumed that when office leases expired last year, it could jack rents way up. Guess what: rents are down, the losses will get worse and the Japanese might default and walk away, as if the noble complex were some termite-ridden shack. Maybe it can wring some deal from the lenders.
 
Denny's Starts to Clean Up Its Act
Even in a society bedeviled by a lingering racism, Denny's stood out. For years blacks' complaints piled up -- of being refused service or asked to pay in advance -- to the point that bias seemed institutional. In May Denny's got the bill, agreeing to pay $54 million to settle thousands of lawsuits. And later it went a step further in its attempt to wipe this smudge from its name, announcing that a black-owned company would buy as many as 47 Denny's restaurants. How long will it be until blacks, spying a Denny's, don't see red? That could take a while.
 
As the Hafts' World Turns: A Score Card
Whenever the news got too solemn last year, you could always count on the Haft family to provide a bit of soap opera buzz. In an all-American rags-to-riches-to-ranting story, Herbert and Gloria Haft built their Dart Group empire from a single drugstore, but riches couldn't buy family peace. These days, they always seem to be suing one another -- father vs. son, husband vs. wife -- and no blood tie proves binding. In May it was Herbert teaming up with his son Ronald against Herbert's ex-wife, Gloria, and their eldest son, Robert. Herbert and Ronald won that one, retaining control. But by September that alliance had collapsed, too, as Ronald tried to oust his father -- a move made more difficult because he needed other family members to back him, and he was not exactly in their good graces. Soon Ronald sued the company, and Herbert sued Ronald. Then, presumably, they all met for a cuddly Thanksgiving dinner (perhaps coming to blows over that last piece of pie).
 
A Simple Pleasure, Made Complicated
Ah, how complicated life has become, even in a place designed expressly to simplify life -- McDonald's. It used to be blissfully simple: the coffee hot, the drinker sitting and sipping. But now everyone's hither and yon, perching take-out coffee in mid-dash. And spilling it. And suing someone. So it was that in August an Albuquerque, N.M., jury awarded $2.9 million to an 81-year-old woman burned by McDonald's coffee she spilled in her lap. McDonald's had arrived at the ideal coffee temperature -- 180 degrees. But the jury decided that that was too hot -- that McDonald's knew it was playing with fire. Then the experts emerged -- showing that fast-food drinks ranged from 154 to 184 degrees, with 154 pegged as "sippable." To sort this out, sit down and have some lukewarm coffee.
 
Some Heavy Huffing and Puffing
Smoking, if not smoke, was much in the air last year. In New York the City Council faced heavy-duty lobbying on an anti-smoking bill, with Philip Morris hinting that it might leave the city; the Council gave some ground but still passed a tough bill. Lawsuits against tobacco companies stepped up a notch in scope -- as typified by Mississippi's suing to recover the costs of smoking-related illnesses. And flight attendants got the go-ahead to file a class-action suit, the first to zero in on second-hand smoke. But the most vivid image was of top tobacco executives on Capitol Hill -- staring at a placard that read "One American dies every 80 seconds from tobacco use" -- and testifying, to a man, that smoking is not addictive.
 
'94? What Was I Doing in '94?
If John Sculley had a "delete" key for his resume, he'd surely wipe out 1994. As the year began, he was saying, "I remain committed to Spectrum," and insisting that the Long Island company -- which most people already sensed was in big, big trouble -- would be a "significant participant in the wireless data communications industry." But within weeks Mr. Sculley, so recently at the high-tech pinnacle running Apple Computer, made a messy exit from Spectrum. The lawsuits flew fast and thick -- breach of contract, fraud, you name it -- before a truce was called.

Continued Vitality For Southeast Asia

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand

 BODY:
Economic prospects around the world look better this year than last. The decision by several large countries to sell off Government-controlled industries is one big engine of growth. Yet deficits, inflation and joblessness keep hampering the pace of recovery in many countries.
For many nations, 1994 was a turnaround year as they began pulling out of recession. Some of the hottest economies, and targets of foreign investment, emerged in once-overlooked markets of Southeast Asia and Latin America. 
 China, a favored destination for foreign investment, slowed down its unrelenting growth last year to 11 percent, a still-formidable rate that strained the capacity of aging industries and power grids. Japan, no longer the growth model for Asia, tried to climb out of its prolonged slump, with growth of barely 1 percent in 1994.
Political developments rattled countries like Mexico, where the peso plummeted after being freed to float against the dollar. Eastern Europe continued to slough off old Communist habits. But in Russia, the best economic news may have been that growth dropped off only 8 percent in 1994, compared with double-digit declines in the previous two years.
Trade liberalization became an international byword, notably with the North American Free Trade Association, now a year old. But frontier barriers were also lowered within Europe and Latin America, even as Washington's trade frictions with Japan and China festered. The European Union expanded to 15 countries. And the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade transformed itself into a sleeker new World Trade Organization.
The economic dragons of Southeast Asia kept spitting fire in 1994, and every bit of evidence suggests that this year will be no different.
Even the economic laggards of the region -- the Philippines, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, formerly Burma -- are showing new vitality. With Washington's lifting of a 17-year-old trade embargo last February, Vietnam could be poised for the sort of economic boom that it had long envied among its neighbors.
Southeast Asia, capitalizing on its large numbers of low-wage but relatively well-educated workers, remains the most economically vibrant region on earth, with 1994 growth of 7 percent or more in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, the tiny city-state that increasingly serves as the area's economic hub.
Economic forecasts say the growth should be just as impressive this year. In 1994, foreign investment continued to pour in, notably from Japan,
Furthermore, the creation of a vast middle class in Southeast Asia means that many of the products produced in factories here,from cars to TV sets to running shoes, are no longer intended strictly for export.
For the richest Southeast Asians, the problem is where to put all that new-found wealth, and many of them are investing elsewhere in the region.
The downside of the unrestrained economic boom here is the environmental devastation of the region, especially in urban areas, as well as the vast disparity between rich and poor. Simply put, cities like Bangkok, the Thai capital, and Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, are now so overbuilt and congested that they may never again be pleasant places to live. PHILIP SHENON

Japan Is Struggling To Get Back on Track

 BODY:
Economic prospects around the world look better this year than last. The decision by several large countries to sell off Government-controlled industries is one big engine of growth. Yet deficits, inflation and joblessness keep hampering the pace of recovery in many countries.
For many nations, 1994 was a turnaround year as they began pulling out of recession. Some of the hottest economies, and targets of foreign investment, emerged in once-overlooked markets of Southeast Asia and Latin America. 
 China, a favored destination for foreign investment, slowed down its unrelenting growth last year to 11 percent, a still-formidable rate that strained the capacity of aging industries and power grids. Japan, no longer the growth model for Asia, tried to climb out of its prolonged slump, with growth of barely 1 percent in 1994.
Political developments rattled countries like Mexico, where the peso plummeted after being freed to float against the dollar. Eastern Europe continued to slough off old Communist habits. But in Russia, the best economic news may have been that growth dropped off only 8 percent in 1994, compared with double-digit declines in the previous two years.
Trade liberalization became an international byword, notably with the North American Free Trade Association, now a year old. But frontier barriers were also lowered within Europe and Latin America, even as Washington's trade frictions with Japan and China festered. The European Union expanded to 15 countries. And the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade transformed itself into a sleeker new World Trade Organization.
Recessions for Japan were once merely temporary detours on the road to rapid growth. But this time, Japan is having trouble getting back into the economic fast lane.
After a three-year economic slump, its longest since the end of World War II, Japan is expected to continue to recover gradually in 1995. Many economists predict growth this year of 2 to 2.5 percent. That is better than the growth of 1 percent or so expected to have occurred in 1994, but it is still well below the historical levels that turned Japan into the world's second-largest economy.
"There is no big engine this time" to pull the economy out of recession, said Masaru Takagi, chief economist at the Fuji Research Institute.
Exports, which have driven Japan's growth in the past, will be constrained by the strength of the Japanese yen, which makes Japanese products less competitive abroad. Capital spending, another factor in past booms, will also be weak. Japanese companies still have too much factory capacity at home and have been shifting manufacturing to lower-cost nations, where they can escape the effects of the high yen.
Banks, meanwhile, will be cautious in lending money for corporate expansion because they continue to be hobbled by tens of billions of dollars in bad loans resulting from the collapse of real estate and stock prices following the speculative boom of the late 1980's.
Still, there are signs of hope. Consumer spending is increasing, helped by income tax cuts.
Goldman, Sachs & Company estimates that for the fiscal year ending in March, corporate profits will rise 24 percent on a gain in sales of only six-tenths of 1 percent.
Rising profits should translate into higher wages and bonuses, helping fuel the recovery, said Jesper Koll, head of research in Japan for J. P. Morgan. He predicts relatively robust growth of 3 percent this year.
One bright spot for Japan is that the economic recovery should lead to further increases in imports, which have already been growing because of the strength of the Japanese yen. That should finally help cut Japan's politically nettlesome trade surplus. ANDREW POLLACK

Daunting Challenges For China's Leaders

Economic prospects around the world look better this year than last. The decision by several large countries to sell off Government-controlled industries is one big engine of growth. Yet deficits, inflation and joblessness keep hampering the pace of recovery in many countries.
For many nations, 1994 was a turnaround year as they began pulling out of recession. Some of the hottest economies, and targets of foreign investment, emerged in once-overlooked markets of Southeast Asia and Latin America.

Trade liberalization became an international byword, notably with the North American Free Trade Association, now a year old. But frontier barriers were also lowered within Europe and Latin America, even as Washington's trade frictions with Japan and China festered. The European Union expanded to 15 countries. And the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade transformed itself into a sleeker new World Trade Organization.
China has dazzled the world with its economic performance in the last two years, but its economic foundations are creaking. And the deteriorating health of Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, has become an obsessive concern for anyone trying to gauge where the country's markets and economic changes will go in 1995.
Growth in 1994 was 11.5 percent after two years of 13 percent annual expansion, yet questions persist about the health of the banking system and the state-owned industrial sector.
Foreign investment continues to flood in, with $57 billion pledged and $22.72 billion actually in place, an increase of 49 percent over that of 1993.
The Communist Party leadership says that structural changes deferred in 1994 will be resumed in 1995, with the emphasis on building a social security and unemployment insurance system to catch workers falling out of the "iron rice bowl" of lifelong employment in state enterprises. The next stage is arguably the most difficult because it will result in the layoff of millions of workers at a time when unemployment is already projected to reach 268 million in the next six years.
But China's economic reformers face daunting challenges. There is much contention over how to apply the tools of bankruptcy and privatization to China's aged industrial structures.
The Communist Party seems intent on preserving a large state sector through invigoration with foreign capital, but skeptics about this policy abound. State-owned factories continue to soak up more than 70 percent of all investment and 80 percent of all bank loans, while contributing only 43 percent to the gross value of industrial output.
The income deposited in the banks as savings by private and collective enterprises, which have become the most productive parts of the economy, are flowing back out as loans to subsidize state factories.
Real growth in China's gross domestic product is projected to slow to about 10 percent in 1995, but even this may be illusory since inventories are piling up in many industrial sectors. PATRICK E. TYLER

Russia Faces Plenty Of Disappointment

Political developments rattled countries like Mexico, where the peso plummeted after being freed to float against the dollar. Eastern Europe continued to slough off old Communist habits. But in Russia, the best economic news may have been that growth dropped off only 8 percent in 1994, compared with double-digit declines in the previous two years.
Trade liberalization became an international byword, notably with the North American Free Trade Association, now a year old. But frontier barriers were also lowered within Europe and Latin America, even as Washington's trade frictions with Japan and China festered. The European Union expanded to 15 countries. And the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade transformed itself into a sleeker new World Trade Organization.
Russia finds itself at the end of another year in a now-familiar position, both politically and economically: the worst has not happened, but there is plenty of disappointment to go around.
Since using tanks to win his confrontation with the old Parliament, President Boris N. Yeltsin has moved sharply toward the nationalist middle. But he continues to swear allegiance to the idea of a low-inflation market reform, as does his Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.
Still, the number of Western-oriented reformers in the Cabinet has become parlously small, and even the most powerful of them, Anatoly B. Chubais, a First Deputy Prime Minister, has a larger constituency among Western bankers and governments than he has domestically.
While the Government has drafted an extremely tight budget for 1995, promising to take no more credits from the Central Bank to finance the deficit and projecting monthly inflation of 2 percent by the end of 1995, no one believes the Parliament will approve it. And no one can be sure that the Government will not once again, as it did last year, simply decide to ignore its own budget and start printing rubles in large numbers.
After Russia's most serious effort so far at economic stabilization, which held monthly inflation down to 4.6 percent in August, the cost of breaking the budget during the summer became apparent; monthly inflation surged to 15 percent in the last quarter of the year -- roughly where it was in December 1993.
The International Monetary Fund is contemplating providing as much as $12 billion in transitional and regular lending to Russia in 1995 -- in return for real stabilization. But the fund is having doubts about the ability of the Government to keep its promises as Russia's politics intensify. All officials are looking ahead to parliamentary elections in December 1995 and presidential ones the next June.
Still, inflation-adjusted incomes are going up, an average of 5 percent a month, even though they still represent only 82 percent of the last decent Soviet year, in 1990. Real wages are up more than 20 percent from the beginning of price liberalization in June 1992, and so is real consumption, with a wide choice of goods. The average industrial wage is more than $100 a month, despite the ruble's drop in value against the dollar.
Pensioners are being hurt less than the unemployed, whose number is rising gradually, or the larger numbers paid minimum salaries by factories that cannot pay them properly but do not want to discharge them. As many as nine million people, or about 11 percent of the work force, are thought to be unemployed or sharply underemployed, although the official jobless register is about a quarter of that figure.
Privatization is continuing on a cash basis and Western investors are beginning to figure out a path through the twisted thicket of Russian regulations, duties and manifold taxes, which, if followed scrupulously, would make it impossible for anyone to do any business.
"No one tries to slam their brakes on a slippery road," said one senior American official optimistically, trying to explain why Russia's on-again, off-again overhaul was not so bad. "You've got to pump the brakes." STEVEN ERLANGER

East Europe Looks To Union With West

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
Economic prospects around the world look better this year than last. The decision by several large countries to sell off Government-controlled industries is one big engine of growth. Yet deficits, inflation and joblessness keep hampering the pace of recovery in many countries.
For many nations, 1994 was a turnaround year as they began pulling out of recession. Some of the hottest economies, and targets of foreign investment, emerged in once-overlooked markets of Southeast Asia and Latin America. 
 China, a favored destination for foreign investment, slowed down its unrelenting growth last year to 11 percent, a still-formidable rate that strained the capacity of aging industries and power grids. Japan, no longer the growth model for Asia, tried to climb out of its prolonged slump, with growth of barely 1 percent in 1994.
Political developments rattled countries like Mexico, where the peso plummeted after being freed to float against the dollar. Eastern Europe continued to slough off old Communist habits. But in Russia, the best economic news may have been that growth dropped off only 8 percent in 1994, compared with double-digit declines in the previous two years.
Trade liberalization became an international byword, notably with the North American Free Trade Association, now a year old. But frontier barriers were also lowered within Europe and Latin America, even as Washington's trade frictions with Japan and China festered. The European Union expanded to 15 countries. And the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade transformed itself into a sleeker new World Trade Organization.
With most countries in Eastern Europe having shown economic growth last year, expectations are widespread that the upswing will continue this year. Of the many problems that afflict the region's four strongest economies -- Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia -- as they make the transition to market economies, relations with the European Union was the common theme of 1994.
For all the talk in Brussels about the "irreversible momentum" toward bringing the four into the union, the reality of membership appeared somewhat less certain. High tariff walls by the union against the region's most exportable goods -- steel and textiles -- remained in place. And despite a pledge at the union's meeting in December to work toward membership for the four eastern countries, there has been little movement on practicalities.
Given the political disagreements within the union, some analysts came away from the meeting, the first to which the four countries were invited as observers, believing that it could be well into the next decade before the Eastern European contenders are admitted into the Brussels club.
Poland continued to show the steadiest growth, with a 4.5 percent increase in gross domestic product. The settlement of its huge debt with Western creditor banks in October was expected to pave the way for increased foreign investment. But there were continuing concerns about inflation. The central bank asserted that full-year inflation could reach 30 percent, well above the 23 percent specified in the 1994 budget legislation.
Perhaps of most concern to investors was the reluctance of the Government, dominated by two parties with roots in the Communist era, to get a long-awaited program of mass privatization off the ground.
"This became the symbol of Polish impotence," said Wieslaw Rozlucki, chairman of the board of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
In contrast, the Czech Republic forged ahead with its privatization of state industries by selling vouchers at nominal value to millions of Czech citizens. As these companies begin to restructure this year, unemployment is bound to rise from the current 3.5 percent, by far the lowest in the region.
The election in Slovakia of Vladimir Meciar as Prime Minister for the third time looks likely to set back Slovak economic growth. He has pledged to undo the privatization of state companies and to pour money into the ailing public sector.
In Hungary, where foreign investment has slowed after a roaring several years, the new socialist Government faces making drastic spending cuts. The International Monetary Fund has told the Government that a budget deficit of 9 percent of gross domestic product is unacceptable. JANE PERLEZ

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1995: Global Economic Prospects Are Brighter for Most;
Europe's Economies Are in an Upswing

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT

 BODY:
Economic prospects around the world look better this year than last. The decision by several large countries to sell off Government-controlled industries is one big engine of growth. Yet deficits, inflation and joblessness keep hampering the pace of recovery in many countries.
For many nations, 1994 was a turnaround year as they began pulling out of recession. Some of the hottest economies, and targets of foreign investment, emerged in once-overlooked markets of Southeast Asia and Latin America. 
 China, a favored destination for foreign investment, slowed down its unrelenting growth last year to 11 percent, a still-formidable rate that strained the capacity of aging industries and power grids. Japan, no longer the growth model for Asia, tried to climb out of its prolonged slump, with growth of barely 1 percent in 1994.
Political developments rattled countries like Mexico, where the peso plummeted after being freed to float against the dollar. Eastern Europe continued to slough off old Communist habits. But in Russia, the best economic news may have been that growth dropped off only 8 percent in 1994, compared with double-digit declines in the previous two years.
Trade liberalization became an international byword, notably with the North American Free Trade Association, now a year old. But frontier barriers were also lowered within Europe and Latin America, even as Washington's trade frictions with Japan and China festered. The European Union expanded to 15 countries. And the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade transformed itself into a sleeker new World Trade Organization.
Many executives across Europe are celebrating not just a new year. After passing through their worst postwar recession, during which doomsayers contended that Europe had become so uncompetitive that it would take years to recover, economies from Italy to Scandinavia are in an upswing.
For Western Europe as a whole, growth of 3 percent or more is predicted for 1995 and 1996. Inflation remains subdued, at less than 3 percent. Industrial production is strong and many corporations are reporting profit rises of more than 50 percent.
Moreover, companies are beginning to increase their capital investment. The early stages of the recovery were driven by a surge in demand for European goods from rapidly expanding regions like Asia and North America.
So what could possibly go wrong?
"I think just as during the recession people were too pessimistic, now people are too optimistic," said Richard Reid, chief economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland's Frankfurt office.
Despite the promising numbers, Europe has emerged from recession with social and political problems that will constantly cast a shadow over such bright economic trends.
The war in the former Yugoslavia, as well as Russia's invasion of the Chechen Republic, reminds leaders that instability is close by.
Some of Western Europe's leaders govern by tiny majorities, like John Major in Britain and Helmut Kohl in Germany. Leaders in other countries have seen their governments rocked by corruption charges, like Felipe Gonzalez in Spain and Silvio Berlusconi in Italy. And France faces an uncertain presidential election.
Europe emerged from the recession with more than 16 million unemployed and an equal number underemployed, and although the recovery will reduce those numbers somewhat over the coming months, economists say unemployment will be far above the low levels enjoyed in the 1980's.
This is a disturbing new reality for social welfare states that are not used to seeing large groups caught in poverty. And European budgets for social payments are already stretched beyond acceptability.
In terms of competitiveness, Europe still has the highest wage levels of any major trading bloc in the world, generating warnings that unless wages are cut or productivity significantly increased, Europe could find itself excluded from new markets. NATHANIEL C. NASH

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1995: Global Economic Prospects Are Brighter for Most;
Canada's Momentum Expected to Continue

 BODY:
Economic prospects around the world look better this year than last. The decision by several large countries to sell off Government-controlled industries is one big engine of growth. Yet deficits, inflation and joblessness keep hampering the pace of recovery in many countries.
For many nations, 1994 was a turnaround year as they began pulling out of recession. Some of the hottest economies, and targets of foreign investment, emerged in once-overlooked markets of Southeast Asia and Latin America. 
 China, a favored destination for foreign investment, slowed down its unrelenting growth last year to 11 percent, a still-formidable rate that strained the capacity of aging industries and power grids. Japan, no longer the growth model for Asia, tried to climb out of its prolonged slump, with growth of barely 1 percent in 1994.
Political developments rattled countries like Mexico, where the peso plummeted after being freed to float against the dollar. Eastern Europe continued to slough off old Communist habits. But in Russia, the best economic news may have been that growth dropped off only 8 percent in 1994, compared with double-digit declines in the previous two years.
Trade liberalization became an international byword, notably with the North American Free Trade Association, now a year old. But frontier barriers were also lowered within Europe and Latin America, even as Washington's trade frictions with Japan and China festered. The European Union expanded to 15 countries. And the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade transformed itself into a sleeker new World Trade Organization.
Thanks to increasing exports, surging corporate investment and job growth that has dropped unemployment into single digits for the first time in four years, Canada enjoyed a banner economic year in 1994, and most economic forecasters expect the momentum to continue.
The depth and breadth of the expansion in 1994 surprised many Canadians. In 1993, when then-Prime Minister Kim Campbell predicted that joblessness would remain in double digits throughout the decade, few economists challenged her. Yet in November alone, the economy created 95,000 full-time jobs, matching a record set in 1980. Unemployment fell to 9.6 percent during the month, compared with 11.4 percent of the work force last January.
"The good news is that further expansion should create more jobs in 1995," said Aron Gampel, vice president and assistant chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia. "The bad news is that the spending power of consumers, representing two-thirds of national output, will be cut into by both tax increases and higher borrowing costs."
For all the talk of tax cuts south of the border, Canadians are likely to see higher taxes along with spending reductions as their Government tackles a huge fiscal deficit in its annual budget deliberations in February and tries to address a worsening debt problem. Federal and provincial debt amounted to 62 percent of Canada's gross domestic product in 1993 and was probably even higher last year. Among industrial countries, only Italy can top that.
Although Canada has almost no inflation, interest rates are rising, chiefly to keep happy the foreign bond investors. A threat that Quebec might separate from the rest of the nation has also nudged rates higher.
Despite these negatives, Canada, which underwent painful restructuring in adjusting to the trade liberalization of the North American Free Trade Agreement, has emerged a leaner competitor. The economy expanded at a 4.7 percent rate in the third quarter. Almost all of that growth reflected exports, mostly to America.
Exports now account for 30 percent of Canadian output, up from 21 percent at the end of 1991. Comparing exports with G.D.P., Canada has become the industrial world's most successful exporting nation. CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1995: Global Economic Prospects Are Brighter for Most;
Higher Growth Seen For Latin America

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil

 BODY:
Economic prospects around the world look better this year than last. The decision by several large countries to sell off Government-controlled industries is one big engine of growth. Yet deficits, inflation and joblessness keep hampering the pace of recovery in many countries.
For many nations, 1994 was a turnaround year as they began pulling out of recession. Some of the hottest economies, and targets of foreign investment, emerged in once-overlooked markets of Southeast Asia and Latin America. 
China, a favored destination for foreign investment, slowed down its unrelenting growth last year to 11 percent, a still-formidable rate that strained the capacity of aging industries and power grids. Japan, no longer the growth model for Asia, tried to climb out of its prolonged slump, with growth of barely 1 percent in 1994.
Political developments rattled countries like Mexico, where the peso plummeted after being freed to float against the dollar. Eastern Europe continued to slough off old Communist habits. But in Russia, the best economic news may have been that growth dropped off only 8 percent in 1994, compared with double-digit declines in the previous two years.
Trade liberalization became an international byword, notably with the North American Free Trade Association, now a year old. But frontier barriers were also lowered within Europe and Latin America, even as Washington's trade frictions with Japan and China festered. The European Union expanded to 15 countries. And the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade transformed itself into a sleeker new World Trade Organization.
With inflation down and foreign investor interest strong, Latin America is expected to record higher growth in 1995, maintaining its position as the world's fastest-growing region after Southeast Asia.
"We are anticipating a good year in 1995, perhaps the best of the last 10 years," said Gert Rosenthal, executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. Prices for Latin America's export commodities -- from coffee to copper -- also look strong.
Latin America's economy ministers are wiping away trade barriers and harnessing private capital to build roads and power plants, to maintain pension plans and to privatize state-run factories. With orthodox economics firmly in vogue, Latin America's overall 1995 inflation rate, excepting Brazil's, is declining toward 9.5 percent.
"For the first time in at least 20 years, Latin America could have single-digit inflation," said Sebastian Edwards, the World Bank's head economist for Latin America.
On the growth side, Brazil, the region's locomotive, is expected to increase its growth from 3.7 percent in 1994 to 4.5 percent in 1995. This would pull the region's economic average from 3.5 percent in 1994 to 4.5 percent for 1995, Mr. Rosenthal said.
In 1994, Peru was the big winner, with 13 percent growth and 18 percent inflation. In 1995, Argentina and Chile hope to achieve 6 percent growth.
The continent's conspicuous exception is Venezuela, whose gross national product dropped 3 percent while annual inflation hovered around 70 percent. Venezuela's fling with price and import controls chilled investors, forcing the 1994 trading volume on the Caracas stock market down by 25 percent.
While some analysts say Latin America's stock markets are overvalued, others see more room for growth.
"If reforms are solidly put in place and consolidated, there is a lot of potential in South America's stock markets," Mr. Edwards said. "If reforms are put in place, the region as a whole could double its growth rates by the end of the decade."
Through 1994, analysts worried that repeated increases in United States interest rates would siphon investment capital away from Latin America, but it hardly happened. In 1993, net inflows of capital to Latin America totaled $65 billion. But in 1994, they almost kept pace, totaling $57 billion. Latin America's foreign trade jumped by 15 percent in 1994, more than twice the increase registered in 1993. JAMES BROOKE

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1995: MARKETS & INVESTING;
Stock Market Analysts Expect Strong Finish to 1995

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Somewhere, undoubtedly, there is handwringing over the prospect of a big, deep bear market this year. Just as certainly, there are some market seers out there who expect very big things from the stock market in 1995.
 But Wall Street analysts in the mainstream expect the stock market to be shaky in the first half and better later, with market average hitting highs for the year in the fourth quarter. Most expect the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average to trade within a narrow 400-point range this year. 
 Fearful of a bit of a bumpy ride during the first months of 1995, most strategists have less than half of their model portfolios invested in stocks, well below historic norms.
 As 1994 began, most of the anaysts surveyed here were nervous about the bond market. Few, however, expected things to get as bad as they did.
 "At the end of 1993, we were telling clients that stocks would dramatically outperform bonds, and they have," said Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chariman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "At one point, the S.& P. 500 index was flat, while bonds were down 30 percent."
 No one is expecting a rerun in 1995. Bond yields may well rise a bit more in the first half of the year, to as high as 8.5 percent, some say, before leveling off and declining by the end of the year.
 And in the face of continued strong growth in the economy, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep pushing up short-term interest rates.
 Albert Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards Inc., predicts the Federal funds rate will peak at around 7.5 percent, two full percentage points above its current leve.
 Indeed, if there is a risk to what is generally seen as a solid if not glowing outlook for the stock market this year, it is that in its effort to rein in growth, the Fed might push interest rates too high, forcing the economy into recession.
 "If short-term interest rates go up by more than another percentage point, you rund the risk of greater dislocations, and more disasters like Orange County," said Eric T. Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc.
 An overzealous response by the Fed to continued strong growth in the economy would be a big mistake, many of these strategists said, because inflation is not likely to be a problem in 1995. Consumer prices will probably go up a little over the course of the year but will not rise much above an annualized rate of 3 percent to 3.5 percent, they said.
 At the moment, Wall Street does not see much chance of lawmakers in Washington creating a furor in the debt and stock markets by passing tax cuts that would vastly inflate the Federal budget deficit.
 "The budget rules and political dynamics are vastly different now than they were in the 1980's," said Jeffrey M. Applegate, chief investment strategist at the CS First Boston Corporation.
 "Is the Federal deficit likely to change enough - eith good or bad - to significantly reprice stocks, bonds or the dollar? No."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 7, 1995, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A chart on Tuesday in the special Outlook '95 section of Business Day about investment strategies by seven stock market analysts misstated a prediction by one analyst. David Holt, a portfolio strategist at Wedbush Morgan Securities, expects the Dow Jones industrial average to rise as high as 3,900 this year, not 3,700.

HEADLINE: MARKETS & INVESTING: A Wild Ride for Emerging Markets;
Ups and Downs In Latin America

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
The major markets in Europe generally did not do much last year, but there was plenty of action out on the volatile new frontiers of emerging markets, enriching some investors and impoverishing others.
 In Brazil, the Bovespa equity index finished the year up by well over half in dollar terms, and other markets in Peru and Chile were not far behind. But the losers were almost as conspicuous as the winners. The new stock markets in China's burgeoning cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen ended 1994 down by more than a third. The most embarrassing performance was turned in by Turkey's stock market, whose value was cut 49 percent over the year. The Turkish market was a big winner in 1993. 
In Europe, stock markets moved circumspectly in response to elections at home and skittishly in anticipation of rising interest rates in the United States. The weaker dollar against major currencies from Frankfurt to Tokyo made European and Japanese exports more expensive and left some industry stocks overpriced for foreigners.
 Swings in exchange rates also skewered market returns for foreign investors. Mexico's Bolsa ended the year off by nearly 41 percent, dragged down by the peso's devaluation. But the Nikkei index in Japan finished up 27 percent after the stronger Japanese yen moved into double digits against the dollar.
 Emerging markets promise the most exciting opportunities again in 1995, perhaps too exciting for the faint of heart.
 Latin American equities had a mixed year. Economic reform and expansion drove the financial markets in Brazil and Chile to new heights, while exchanges in Mexico and Argentina fared poorly because of rising U.S. interest rates and domestic problems.
 The lesson is that Latin America cannot be viewed as a monolith because individual markets respond mainly to their own economic and political climate. Even so, analysts are generally optimistic.
 The disparities were apparent enough in 1994. The Brazilian stock market was up 60 percent by one index, while Argentina's was down by more than 20 percent. And Chile's market climbed 51 percent, but Mexico's dropped 41 percent after the peso was devalued.
 The economic changes introduced by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso made Brazil one of the most exciting markets.
 Mexico proved the biggest disappointment. The year started with a guerrilla uprising in Chiapas and ended with both the battered peso and the Government in trouble.
 Chile, with a healthy stock market, benefited from decent growth and sound economic policies. The Chilean market is expected to continue its rise.
 Peru's phenomenal growth rate of 12 percent in 1994 helped the financial market in that country climb 53 percent, and an economic overhaul could push it higher in 1995.
 Jitters over Argentina's growing trade deficit, rising unemployment and higher United States interest rates have depressed the market here, but analysts said the market could rally if President Carlos Menem is re-elected. CALVIN SIMS

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1995: THE ECONOMY;
Recovery Is Entitled to Respect

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
AT first, it was tagged the "jobless recovery." Then, the complaint was that average workers were still suffering from shrinking paychecks. Now, the fear is that the Federal Reserve is about to squash any further growth. The 1990's expansion, almost four years old, just can't get any respect these days.
 But for all the naysaying, what is forgotten is that it's not just how fast you've been going, but how far you've come. Comparing the 1990's economy at this point in its expansion with a similar point in the 1980's, this recovery looks similarly solid and durable. 
How can that be? Simple. For one thing, the economy was not trying to climb out of as deep a hole this time around.
 The 1983 recovery came on the heels of two back-to-back recessions -- in 1980 and again from early 1981 through nearly the end of 1982 -- that shrank the nation's gross domestic product by 2.7 percent. Unemployment hovered close to 10 percent for two straight years. The 1990's recession by contrast, produced a drop of just half a percentage point in the annual G.D.P., less than one-fourth the decline of the early 1980's. It pushed up unemployment for a year to an average of not much more than 7 percent.
 Of course, the carping about the 1990's economy is not totally off the wall. This recovery started with a whimper instead of a bang. Until very recently, it pretty much skipped both coasts and many of the industries -- defense and commercial real estate are particular standouts -- that prospered in the early 1980's. It has also not lifted some basic measures of economic performance as speedily as in the boom from 1983 to 1985.
 Still, unlike most recoveries that start off sprinting and then settle down, this one has picked up momentum as it has matured. Much of the good news is too recent to have sunk in.
 Start with that handy yardstick, the misery index, which combines joblessness and inflation. After 14 quarters, the misery index is lower now than in mid-1986, 8.7 percent versus 10.9. Inflation is less than 3 percent, even lower than in 1986, when oil prices collapsed. Unemployment is a full percentage point lower than in 1986.
 Per-capita income is 7 percent higher in 1994 than in 1986, $14,484 versus $13,552. And pay per worker is 3 percent higher, $22,173, compared with $21,518.
 As it happens, wage and salary income per private-sector worker -- including bonuses, sales commissions, profit-sharing plans, 401(k) plans, consulting fees and the like -- has been climbing much faster in this recovery than in the early 1980's recovery.
 Growth also looks healthier in some respects. The Federal deficit is a little lower in absolute terms, $202 billion in the fiscal year 1994 compared with $221 billion in the fiscal year 1986, but substantially lower in percentage terms, 3 percent instead of 5.6 percent.
 Exports, which were depressed by the strong dollar in the early 1980's, have been growing more than twice as fast in this recovery. That is a big factor in the rebirth of American industry concentrated in the Midwest and Southeast.
 And more of the growth is coming from investment and less from consumption, a combination that many economists believe augers well for future economic growth. Equipment spending has been soaring at a 12.3 percent rate, compared with 8.5 percent. Consumer spending, meanwhile is rising at a 2.9 percent annual rate versus 4.4 percent.
 "This is as good as it's possible to get," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch. "Consumer spending is growing at a healthy pace, but not too fast. Capital spending is very strong."
 Productivity, the engine of rising living standards, has already been growing somewhat faster than in the early 1980's. It's been up at a 1.5 percent annual rate, on average, compared with less than 1 percent in the 1980's.
 There's no question that the growth of both output and jobs has been more moderate. Payrolls have expanded half as fast. Output has grown two-thirds as fast.
 But ask yourself what would have happened if somehow or other the United States economy were creating 500,000 jobs a month instead of 200,000, or G.D.P. had risen at a much faster rate. But Fed or no Fed, Republican President or Democrat, the economy's growth limits are set by the increase in the labor force and its productivity. For the United States right now, those limits appear to fall somewhere between 2 percent or 3 percent a year.
 It is true that many people felt better in the early boom years of the Reagan recovery. But what is missed by many critics -- who tend to be concentrated in the media centers of New York, Washington and Los Angeles where the recovery has been most limited -- is that so many Americans actually feel much better these days about the economy than is generally recognized.
 In many parts of the country, consumer confidence is higher today than in the mid-1980's. While people in the Northeast and in California do not feel as upbeat about the economy, those in the Midwest, the Mountain States and the South report that they are decidedly more optimistic.
 This good feeling took a long time to materialize.
 "Confidence really improved in the first year of the 1980's recovery," said Jason Bramm, an economist at the Conference Board. "This time, the improvement came in 1994, three years into the recovery."
 One place, however, that is not sounding nearly as confident is Washington. Ronald Reagan talked about morning in America even as interest rates shot to 20 percent and unemployment rose to the double digits. Blessed with some of the best economic numbers in a generation, President Clinton cannot seem to communicate the good news.

HEADLINE: History Shows Stocks Will Go Up (or Down)

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Looking for a sure-fire way to use history to forecast the stock market? Here are a few choices. If they appear to be contradictory, don't let that bother you. Some of them are sure to be right.
 Fives are fine. The stock market always goes up in years ending in the number 5, like 1995. That record goes back to at least 1895, and over that stretch the average gain for the Dow Jones industrials in years ending in 5 has been an astounding 31.4 percent. Much of that is because of an 81.7 percent rise in 1915, when World War I created tremendous demand for American products, but in four other 5's -- 1905, 1925, 1935 and 1975 -- the Dow gained at least 30 percent. 
Pre-election joys. Presumably because the Government wants to make people feel good when an election is approaching, the years before Presidential elections tend to be good ones for the economy and for the stock market. The Dow has risen in every pre-election year since World War II, although that record includes 1987, a year in which a great start was followed by a crash for an overall 2.3 percent gain. In the 14 Presidential elections from 1888 to 1940, the Dow rose in the previous year exactly half the time.
 Toy troubles. Retailing stocks generally do well from Thanksgiving to Christmas. But they fell this past year, and this happened in recent years only in 1986, 1989 and 1993. In each of the years that followed, the stock market had its problems, with the Dow falling in 1990 and eking out gains in 1987 and 1994.
 Super Bowl comeback. The Super Bowl indicator, which has an impressive record of forecasting the stock market, calls for the Dow to rise in the 12 months that began when Dallas won last Jan. 30. The Dow was then at 3,945.43. If that indicator is to work, the Dow will have to rise 2.9 percent this month.
 Unlucky 15. Only three times in history has the Dow average managed to show gains in 15 of 20 consecutive years -- in the periods ending in 1961, 1968 and 1994. In the first two cases, the momentum was gone. By late June 1962, the Dow was down 27 percent from the prior year. By late July 1969, the fall was 15 percent.
 Nine out of 10 isn't bad. The Dow has shown gains in 9 of the last 10 years, with 1990 the only loser. But there is no indicator to forecast what happens now. Such a string has never occurred before.

Industry Groups Cope With Cost-Cutting and Consolidation;
Steel's Prospects Are Bright for '95

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
The domestic steel industry is looking forward to another good year, after a year when soaring demand from automobile and appliance makers had mills straining to fill orders. With buyers so eager, the steel companies were able to push through several rounds of price increases, and prices are expected to continue rising.
 Hot sales and higher prices brought profits to many companies that just a few year ago were struggling to stem losses and shrink capacity. But few stood out as prominently as the AK Steel Corporation , formerly the foundering carbon steel division of Armco Inc. Carbon steels are used in autos, appliances and structural applications. 
As recently as 1992, the mills that constitute AK Steel in Middletown, Ohio, and Ashland, Ky., lost $465 million. Armco had decided to get out of the big, but intensely competitive, carbon steel business to concentrate on stainless and other specialty steels.
 Armco and its Japanese partner, the Kawasaki Steel Corporation, brought in a new management team in June 1992, including Thomas C. Graham, who is credited with improving the USX Corporation's steel operation in the 1980's.
 Mr. Graham and his group began trimming costs, improving quality, adhering more closely to delivery schedules and emphasizing higher-technology galvanized and coated steels that fetch higher prices. With demand high, they pushed equipment to record production levels, while reducing labor costs.
 Less than two years later, in April, the company, named AK Steel after its previous owners, sold an initial public offering that reduced Armco's holding to 4.3 percent and Kawasaki's to 22 percent.
 By the third quarter, the company was the most profitable of the integrated steel companies, earning $51 per ton shipped, more than double an integrated industry average of $23 a ton.
 The company is continuing to improve its efficiency and had cut man- hours of labor per ton from more than 4 in the second half of 1993 to a goal of 3.5 by the end of last year. And it is preparing to invest in new technology that will permit it to increase the capacity of its blast furnaces without a huge capital investment. JOHN HOLUSHA

Looking Ahead, Warily, to Brighter Days for Wall Street

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN

 BODY:
Wall Street's prospects are looking brighter in 1995. But after the pain of 1994, that may not be saying very much.
 Most analysts predict that this year will be a more "normal" year for the industry, in part because they do not expect to be surprised by another sharp rise in interest rates. A larger number of takeovers and mergers is expected to fuel the deal business for investment bankers, and the equity markets, which remained relatively strong in 1994, are expected to perform well, helping to lift profits above 1994 levels. 
But the bond market will still be weak, analysts and executives say. "I don't see a big turnaround in the volume of debt issuance," said Jon Corzine, senior partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
 In 1994 the securities industry's executives were reminded that the business is cyclical.
 Wall Street's top firms had ridden a wave of declining interest rates to a series of record years from 1991 through 1993 and then, leveraging their capital to the hilt, continued to bet that rates would remain low in 1994. When the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates in February for the first time in five years, the bubble burst.
 "After this year's performance, tell me you're a master of the universe," said a senior executive at Salomon Brothers, which lost $242 million after taxes in the first nine months. "Go ahead, tell me," said the executive, who asked not to be identified.
 By the end of November, after five more rate increases by the Fed, 30-year Treasury bonds had plunged more than 20 percent in value. Investor losses amounted to more than $1 trillion, according to the Securities Industry Association, equal to the wealth that was wiped out by 1987's stock market crash.
 The rising rates also dried up debt and equity underwriting, drove the previously booming mortgage securities trade into a free fall, and eliminated the easy money that Wall Street firms had been making simply by borrowing at short-term interest rates to buy higher-yielding, longer-term paper.
The profits of New York Stock Exchange member firms declined 80 percent in the first nine months of the year, falling from $8.6 billion to $1.8 billion on an annualized basis.
 Most of the pain was borne by the large investment banks like Goldman, Sachs and Salomon Brothers, which depend on underwriting and bond trading for the bulk of their revenue. Discount brokerages and regional firms, which rely on commissions for a larger percentage of their earnings, fared better because trading volume on the major stock exchanges decreased only slightly.
 The asset management business also performed well last year, helping to buck up the earnings of big, full-service firms like Merrill Lynch & Company and the Travelers' Smith Barney unit.
 Bonus payments plunged drastically, nevertheless, and nearly every major company announced layoffs, thinning their ranks of bond traders and salesmen.
 Other weaknesses were laid bare. The slide in bond prices and the collapse of the mortgage-backed securities market proved the last straws for the General Electric Company, which sold Kidder, Peabody & Company to Paine Webber for $670 million.
 Salomon Brothers management recognized the need to overhaul the company's compensation system when it became clear that six people in its New York bond arbitrage group would split more than $150 million while the firm as a whole was losing money.
 Beginning this year, the proprietary trading group will see its pay based on its profits over three years. Managing directors in Salomon's other businesses, meanwhile, will split 40 percent of any profits the company makes above a 7 percent return on equity.
 Despite the tough times, executives and analysts remain bullish about the long-term prospects of the industry. Americans are investing an increasing amount of their savings in securities. Overseas, more and more governments are selling state-owned businesses to the public. And the demand for money to pay for roads, sewers, electricity plants and other projects in Asia and Eastern Europe will be strong for many years.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1995: THE ECONOMY;
California Starts To Chase the Blues

BYLINE: By SALLIE HOFMEISTER

 BODY:
Across America, the economy of the 1990's is shaping up as the mirror image of the 1980's.
 A decade ago, California and the East Coast were booming; today, they lag behind the rest of the country. The Midwest, then known as the Rust Belt, buckled. Now an industrial revival is restoring much of the original finish to the region. 
Through much of the 1980's, blue-collar workers suffered as manufacturing underwent a painful restructuring to meet tougher world competition. In the 1990's, white-collar employees were lashed by a similar make-over of office-centered services.
 Remember the cold war? The nation's huge military buildup of the 1980's is now being matched by an equally rapid shrinkage of the military industry.
 The computer hardware surge of the last decade, symbolized by I.B.M. and Apple Computer Inc., has been supplanted by the software and networking revolution led by the Microsoft Corporation and Novell Inc.
 Wall Street remains on a roller coaster. Financial services slumped after the stock market crash in 1987. After a revival of the industry in the early 1990's, new traumas were created in 1994 by rising interest rates, the collapse of the bond market, the comeuppance of the hedge funds and the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif.
 And through the decades, people and jobs continued to be drawn to suburbia and to regions, like the South and the Rocky Mountain states, with a reputation for livable comfort.
 The University of California at Los Angeles may have been overstating California's recovery when it chose "Happy Days Are Here Again" as a theme song for its annual business forecasting conference in December.
 "I wouldn't say we're out of the woods," said Joe Mattey, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco. "After an extended period of decline, conditions here have stabilized. But we're not back to pre-recession rates in terms of unemployment, housing sales and the other economic indicators."
 Still, California, lagging behind the national economy by about two years, is definitely crawling out of the trenches after having hit bottom in mid-1993. Though rising interest rates have slowed the housing recovery here in recent months, economists say holiday retail sales in 1994 were far ahead of the previous year. Moreover, construction, business services, tourism, a booming entertainment business and the export trade, bolstered by the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, are all contributing to the recovery.
 Meanwhile, most of the rest of the West has been enjoying a strong boom, driven in part by migration from California and in part by the attractiveness of the mountain and desert states as locations for high-tech industries.
 U.C.L.A. predicts that nonfarm payrolls in California will rise 1.8 percent this year, below the national average of 2.6 percent, but will beat the nation next year with a 3.6 percent gain -- a forecast that some economists are calling overly optimistic.
 Military cutbacks continue to ravage the state, though job losses are not as great as they were earlier in the decade. They are also starting to be offset by growth in other areas, economists say. One study, by Joel Kotkin at the Center for the New West, found that entertainment and tourism have surpassed military-related industries and aerospace in employment in Southern California for the first time.
 Jack Kyser, chief economist for the independent nonprofit Economic Development Corporation, contends that the streamlining of the state environmental process and changes in workers' compensation laws in late 1993 are finally helping to lure employers to the state, although he had only anecdotal evidence.
 Some economists say the migration out of California, which has helped bolster the economies of surrounding states, has also slowed. As California grappled with the aftershocks of the recession, riots, an earthquake, military cutbacks, a construction downturn and a state fiscal crisis, neighboring states like Utah, Arizona, Nevada, Idaho and Oregon enjoyed some of the strongest growth in the country.
 Utah has used its low wages, a central location in the region and hard-working reputation to build a hub around Novell Inc. in software development and production. And, like Nevada and Arizona, it has also benefited as corporations have consolidated their computer back offices in low-cost states.
 Growth has slowed in Washington, meanwhile, because of layoffs at the Boeing Company. SALLIE HOFMEISTER

HEADLINE: MARKETS & INVESTING: A Wild Ride for Emerging Markets;
A Choppy Ride for Europe?

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
The major markets in Europe generally did not do much last year, but there was plenty of action out on the volatile new frontiers of emerging markets, enriching some investors and impoverishing others.
 In Brazil, the Bovespa equity index finished the year up by well over half in dollar terms, and other markets in Peru and Chile were not far behind. But the losers were almost as conspicuous as the winners. The new stock markets in China's burgeoning cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen ended 1994 down by more than a third. The most embarrassing performance was turned in by Turkey's stock market, whose value was cut 49 percent over the year. The Turkish market was a big winner in 1993. 
In Europe, stock markets moved circumspectly in response to elections at home and skittishly in anticipation of rising interest rates in the United States. The weaker dollar against major currencies from Frankfurt to Tokyo made European and Japanese exports more expensive and left some industry stocks overpriced for foreigners.
 Swings in exchange rates also skewered market returns for foreign investors. Mexico's Bolsa ended the year off by nearly 41 percent, dragged down by the peso's devaluation. But the Nikkei index in Japan finished up 27 percent after the stronger Japanese yen moved into double digits against the dollar.
 Emerging markets promise the most exciting opportunities again in 1995, perhaps too exciting for the faint of heart.
 With the unexpectedly early and sharp rise in interest rates in the United States driving down stock prices in most major markets, 1994 was not much of a year for investors in Europe.
 In London, Europe's financial center, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares tumbled from a record of 3,520 early in 1994 to a low of 2,877 and ended the year around 3,000.
 The markets in Germany and France registered drops of similar scale amid concern among equity investors that rising rates would dampen hopes for earnings growth and siphon funds from stocks into bonds. Indeed, every major European market ended well below its high for the year, with a particularly volatile market like Italy's down more than 25 percent.
 What is in store for 1995? Mike Young, the director of European investment strategy at Merrill Lynch in London, said the European markets over all could be in for a choppy ride, especially if the market in the United States declined and European short-term interest rates and bond yields rose.
 "The next move may well be down rather than up," Mr. Young said.
 But there are pockets of opportunity. Finland, Norway, the Netherlands and Britain are currently Merrill Lynch's favorite European markets, he said.
 Many stocks in Finland and Norway, especially cyclical and commodity stocks like paper companies, could still see enhanced earnings from the worldwide economic recovery. Many stocks in the Netherlands could post surprisingly good earnings gains and may benefit from improving market valuations. And Britain, Mr. Young said, is the cheapest of the major markets and has suffered from too much pessimism about the earnings outlook.
 Financial services, energy and consumer-oriented companies all have potential for next year, said Joe Rooney, the strategist at Lehman Brothers in London.
 Lehman Brothers is recommending stocks such as Banco Popular of Spain andABN-Amro of the Netherlands in the banking field. Royal Dutch/Shell of the Netherlands and Total of France are among the major oil companies Lehman is recommending, and A.B. Astra of Sweden, LVMH of France, Heineken of the Netherlands and B.A.T. Industries of Britain are among its favorite consumer-driven stocks. RICHARD W. STEVENSON

Talk of Middle-Class Tax Cut Makes Wall St. Uneasy

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
Wall Street is watching warily as leaders of the new Republican majority in Congress and the Clinton Administration vie for the hearts and minds of the middle class with promises of tax relief.
 Topping the Republican proposals is a bonus for investors -- an exclusion of 50 percent of long-term capital gains from taxable income. The measure would lower capital gains taxes to a range of 7.5 percent to 19.6 percent. President Clinton has countered with a 30 percent exclusion, resulting in taxes of 10.5 to 28 percent, the top rate now. 
As much as it welcomes any cut in the gains tax, Wall Street fears the cut will be just the tip of a deficit-worsening package.
 Among the measures on the table are a $500 refundable credit for children, elimination of the marriage tax penalty, an expanded individual retirement account and fewer taxes on Social Security benefits. It's not that these measures are inherently bad; in fact, several would encourage investment in the same way a capital gains tax cut would. But without specific spending cuts to compensate for any loss in revenue, such a package could spook the markets.
"It would be devastating to the bond market, and would affect stocks also," said Joel Isaacson, president of Joel S. Isaacson & Company, a New York accounting firm that specializes in personal financial planning. "The bond market wants to see spending cuts to offset the deficit."
 Edward J. Campbell, senior economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, the investment banking firm, said the financial markets had not yet factored in the impact of a tax cut because so little was known about its final shape.
 "There are a lot of staunch Republicans" on Wall Street, Dr. Campbell said, "and they believe in the 'Contract With America,' but every time you talk to them, you get a sense they have their fingers crossed" that the final program will be fiscally sound.
 The normal rationale for cutting taxes -- aside from the political appeal of winning votes -- is to stimulate a sagging economy by freeing money for consumer spending. In turn, demand for goods and services increases, leading to greater output and employment.
 That prescription is scarcely the right one now. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates six times in 1994 to keep a robust economy from overheating and becoming inflationary. And that is in spite of a package of tax increases passed in November 1993. To reverse course and cut taxes now could only add fuel to the economy, doubtless leading the Fed to ratchet up interest rates even further.
 As rates rise, the value of debt issued at lower rates drops, while money tends to move away from equities into new bonds, causing stock prices to slump as well.
 A tax cut that promises the American middle class that it can have something for nothing can only grease the skids under an already sliding bond market, said David A. Berenson, a managing partner of the accounting firm Berenson & Company and a former national director of tax policy for Ernst & Young.
 As with a family that lives beyond its means by using one credit card to pay another, the United States has lived with a $203 billion Federal deficit by selling Treasury bonds to investors in Japan, Germany and the Middle East, Mr. Berenson said.
 "Japan has cracks in the economy," he said. "Russia is capital starved and may swing to a right-wing dictatorship without a capital infusion, and Eastern Europe is a basket case."
 Germany, meanwhile, is busily absorbing the former East Germany. America cannot continue "financing folly and mistakes with foreign borrowing," he said.
 Not everyone was so negative about the impact of new tax cuts. Robert Willens, managing director of Lehman Brothers, said, "It could wind up a net nothing."
 In addition to the capital gains cut, the proposal to expand I.R.A.'s and to create a new "American dream account" would have a "dramatic, positive effect on the markets, both stocks and bonds," he said. Like I.R.A. money, some of the disposable income created by any tax cuts would find its way into the financial markets.
 "The other side is that tax cuts are bearish for the bond markets," Mr. Willens continued. "They see deficit spending and inflation." The bad and the good of a package, he suggested, could cancel each other out.
 David D. Hale, chief economist of Kemper Securities Inc., wrote in a recent Economic Review that tax cuts could attract foreign capital immediately. "The Republican takeover of Congress could boost the dollar during the first quarter if the new Congress moves quickly to reduce capital gains taxes and pursue other policies favorable for U.S. savings and investment," he wrote.
 Concerns about the economic impact aside, tax cuts would have positive repercussions for some.
 Avery E. Neumark, a partner in the accounting firm of Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin & Company and its director of employee benefits and executive compensation, expressed enthusiasm for the proposed American dream savings accounts. People would put in after-tax money, which would grow tax-free and be tax-free upon withdrawal if used for retirement after age 59 1/2, for first-home purchases or for college costs.
 "These accounts will encourage young people," he said. "This may encourage investments, and the better the performance, the better the tax break."
 Some tax relief for capital gains is considered a fait accompli, Mr. Neumark said, and that should be positive for the stock market, as people bid up growth stocks.
 Which stocks specifically? Brown Brothers points out that the Republicans' Contract With America calls for less Government, which could mean less pressure on drug makers. Although generally negative about the outlook for equities, the firm is recommending Abbott Laboratories, Pfizer and SmithKline Beecham.
 Reasoning that the Republicans will exert less regulatory pressure on the tobacco industry, the firm's chief financial analyst, Ronald J. Hill, also expects Philip Morris to benefit.
 Energy is another promising sector, says Mr. Hill, who favors Amoco, Royal Dutch, Apache Corporation, Enron and Noble Affiliates.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1995: THE ECONOMY;
Southeast's Lure: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN

 BODY:
Across America, the economy of the 1990's is shaping up as the mirror image of the 1980's.
 A decade ago, California and the East Coast were booming; today, they lag behind the rest of the country. The Midwest, then known as the Rust Belt, buckled. Now an industrial revival is restoring much of the original finish to the region. 
Through much of the 1980's, blue-collar workers suffered as manufacturing underwent a painful restructuring to meet tougher world competition. In the 1990's, white-collar employees were lashed by a similar make-over of office-centered services.
 Remember the cold war? The nation's huge military buildup of the 1980's is now being matched by an equally rapid shrinkage of the military industry.
 The computer hardware surge of the last decade, symbolized by I.B.M. and Apple Computer Inc., has been supplanted by the software and networking revolution led by the Microsoft Corporation and Novell Inc.
 Wall Street remains on a roller coaster. Financial services slumped after the stock market crash in 1987. After a revival of the industry in the early 1990's, new traumas were created in 1994 by rising interest rates, the collapse of the bond market, the comeuppance of the hedge funds and the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif.
 And through the decades, people and jobs continued to be drawn to suburbia and to regions, like the South and the Rocky Mountain states, with a reputation for livable comfort.
 One region that is likely to continue performing strongly, especially in job growth, will be the Southeast, according to many economists.
 Led by Atlanta, the fastest-growing urban economy in the country, the region will probably see slightly higher job growth than other parts of the United States. But at the same time, the pace of growth will begin to slow from the last two years of robust expansion. Job growth for 1995, most economists predict, will be up to 3 percent.
 "The region will do better than the national average," said Thomas J. Cunningham, senior regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta, "and we have for a long time."
 This view is enthusiastically shared by Mark Vintner, a vice president of the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., which owns banks throughout the region.
 "The Southeast is incredibly strong," he said. "It is extremely hard to find any signs of weakness. The only exception would be in the apparel industry."
 Both he and Mr. Cunningham base their 1995 forecasts on strong job growth.
 "Job growth is the best proxy of overall growth," Mr. Vintner said. "Going forward, I'm expecting about 3 percent job growth. At this stage of business expansion, real state gross product is not going to increase faster than job growth.
 "When you look at the number of companies coming to the South, it's overwhelming," Mr. Vintner said. "Companies want to come to a place where they have a good supply of labor and can lower costs, where utility costs are lower, taxes are lower and the quality of life is better. And some of these states are nonunion."
 After a long downturn in foreign corporate investment -- punctuated by several high-visibility manufacturing projects like a Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama and a BMW plant in South Carolina -- there are signs that foreign interest in the Southeast is increasing, according to Donald Ratajczak, the director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta.
 "Foreign investors are slowly coming back," he said. "They are important to our area. The Japanese are in optics, into some of the sporting goods. The Germans in automobiles and auto parts and trucking. The Dutch into all kinds of retailing. The Canadians are into forest products. These are all important players."
 Mr. Ratajczak cautioned, however, that rising interest rates threatened to dampen housing starts, which in turn would affect the region's strong household industries.
 "We're very concerned about what is going to happen to housing," he said. "As interest rates go up, housing will be caught. My forecast is housing will slow, and this will hit our lumber, furniture and carpet industries. We can handle it for six to nine months; then we go down."
 Mr. Vintner says one of the strongest states will be Florida, where he is predicting job growth of 200,000 in 1995, on top of the 220,000 jobs created there in 1994. "There's really solid growth throughout the state," he said.
 In North Carolina, only a shortage of labor is likely to hold growth back. "North Carolina hits the perennial problem of unemployment of 4.1 percent," Mr. Ratajczak said. "How can it possibly grow? It doesn't have the people. North Carolina has to mark time." EDWARD A. GARGAN

Industry Groups Cope With Cost-Cutting and Consolidation;
Retailers Battle Mostly Over Prices

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Retailing has become a commodity business in many ways.
 These days stores are distinguished less by their merchandising flair than by their pricing strategies, which give consumers a powerful weapon. 
And shoppers are increasingly adept at wielding it. Look at what happened to Toys 'R' Us during the holiday selling season: Even though the mighty toy retailer offered more than $1,000 worth of coupons for popular toys and video games, discount stores gave customers even better deals.
 Consequently, whatever sales gains Toys 'R' Us does report today were achieved mostly by sacrificing profits.
 Some chains have reached abroad for their expansion, but the international scene is proving more difficult to conquer than many had expected. Several retailers that took advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement to expand into Mexico have quietly begun pulling back.
 A few retail companies still have costs they can eliminate. The Kmart Corporation, for example, has embarked on a program to close underperforming stores and reduce its head count in hopes of becoming more competitive with Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
 That kind of cost-cutting -- as well as consolidation -- will continue, although its consequences are not necessarily rosy. Only four companies control the warehouse club business now, but none of them are faring particularly well. Consumers are playing them off against each other, and price is still the merchant's weapon of choice. STEPHANIE STROM

Most Markets Take Holiday, but 2 Fall

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
On a day when many exchanges worldwide were closed, German stocks fell sharply yesterday and the Mexican market also closed lower.
 While some exchanges were open in Asia, Europe and Latin America, all banks and financial markets in the United States were closed yesterday for the New Year holiday. 
Stocks fell in Frankfurt, undoing a rally on Friday, and German bonds continued a decline that had pushed their yields to a three-month high.
German stocks were lower across many industries, with the heaviest losses in chemicals and financial services. The DAX index of 30 leading stocks fell 1.29 percent, or 27.13 points, to close at 2,079.45.
 Commenting on the drop in German bond prices, Rainhard Vennekold, a trader at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said, "We're watching the bond future go down step by step."
 Elsewhere, stocks rose in the Netherlands and Spain, but were slightly lower in Italy. The EOE index in Amsterdam closed up 2.72 points, at 417.19. In Madrid, the Ibex index of 35 leading issues gained 4.56 points, to close at 3,092.24. In Milan, the all-share index closed 39 points lower at 10,152.
 Markets were closed in London, Paris and in Switzerland.
 Swedish stocks rose almost 1 percent as optimism over strong corporate earnings offset concerns about a budget to be announced on Jan. 10. "People feel they have fresh money and the whole year to trade on," said Mats Ericsson, a trader at Merchant Fondkommission. "We are seeing some new-year optimism."
 In Hong Kong, stocks were trading sharply lower today after yesterday's holiday. In early afternoon trading, the Hang Seng index was down 252.79 points, or 3.09 percent, to 7,938.25. Japanese markets will be closed until tomorrow.
 Mexico was the only market open in North America yesterday. Stocks closed slightly lower there as investors awaited a speech by President Ernest Zedillo Ponce de Leon outlining Mexico's response to its recent peso crisis. The Bolsa index of 37 stocks closed down 21.42 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, at 2,354.24 in very light trading.
 In currency dealings in Mexico, the peso rose against the dollar as investors bet that the President's emergency economic plan would calm the financial markets.
 It rebounded after falling nearly 5 percent, to 5.40 pesos to the dollar, in morning trading, and closed in Mexico City at 4.925, compared with 5.075 to the dollar on Friday.
 "There is a little bit more confidence," said Jesus Mendez, a foreign-exchange trader at Banpais S.A.
 In other Latin American equity trading yesterday, Brazilian stocks drifted lower. The Bovespa index of the Sao Paulo stock exchange fell 348 points, to 43,191.

Risk Abroad May Keep U.S. Investors Close to Home

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
STOCK market investors didn't make much money last year though corporate profits were stunningly high. The good news of profits being well above forecasts was offset by the fact that the Federal Reserve decided to push up interest rates -- and to keep doing so.
 As 1995 begins, there is general confidence that the economy will remain strong at least for this year, although talk of a 1996 recession has emerged. Corporate profits are generally viewed much more favorably than they were a year ago. There is hope that the dollar has bottomed and that bonds will not fall much more. 
And, perhaps, the American market will benefit from the realization that going abroad can be risky, propelling more Americans to keep their money at home. The rush to stock markets in developing countries -- so profitable earlier in the 1990's -- produced some big disappointments. "If 1993 was the year of emerging markets, 1995 may be the year of emerging companies," said Abby Joseph Cohen, the co-chairman of Goldman, Sach's investment policy committee, who thinks this will be a good year for smaller companies, which as a group trailed big companies last year.
 Stock analysts, whether by nature or because they are paid by firms whose business is selling stocks, are generally an optimistic bunch. And so, year after year, they begin January with rosy forecasts for profits and then spend much of the year cutting their estimates as reality intrudes. But that didn't happen in 1994. For the first time since 1988, many more profit forecasts were raised during the year than were cut.
 Why? Because the economy was 1994's first big surprise. After years of recession and slow growth, few foresaw just how vibrant the economy would be. The best stocks to be in were ones that benefited directly from a stronger economy -- commodity producers and technology companies, for example -- and that were not severely affected by higher interest rates. Utilities and home builders were not industries to own last year, but they may have been beaten down enough to be worth checking out now.
 A year ago, most stocks looked expensive by traditional valuation measures. Now, with the broad averages about where they were a year ago but both dividends and profits higher, they look more reasonable, although still not cheap. A gain of 10 percent or so in corporate profits is expected this year, but that could prove to be optimistic if the economy begins to slow.
 Among those to react to the strong economy was the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates six times during the year, beginning on Feb. 4. As 1994 began, it was conventional wisdom that the Fed would act sometime in the year, but few had actually invested as if they believed it. The biggest investing story of the year was the disasters stemming from leveraged bets -- some using derivatives -- on lower interest rates.
 A lot of the gambling was done by companies that insisted they were only hedging. Perhaps the most amazing disclosure was Procter & Gamble's admission that it had entered into a contract that could force it to pay annual interest rates of more than 40 percent if market interest rates rose a few percentage points. P.& G. sued Bankers Trust, saying it was suckered into a bad deal, and got a new corporate treasurer.
 It was the last of the Fed's 1994 rate increases, on Nov. 15, that now looks most interesting. For one thing, as Ed Yardeni, the chief economist at C. J. Lawrence notes, it was the first time the Fed ever pushed up
short-term rates by three-quarters of a percentage point at a time when there was no immediate and obvious inflation crisis. That caught Wall Street's attention, and long-term bonds have actually risen a bit in price since then.
 As the year ended, rates on Treasuries from 2 to 30 years were not far apart, a drastic change from the last few years. The conventional wisdom now is that the Fed will tighten one or two more times this year, pushing short-term rates almost as high as long-term rates, but will then stop. While it is not clear whether the public believes them, a lot of pros are talking about how attractive bond yields are. Money continues to flow out of bond mutual funds, as a new generation of investors learns that it is quite possible to lose money in bonds.
 It was not only profits that kept the stock market from falling. A lot of money came in from mutual fund investors, although their enthusiasm seemed to wane a bit in the last couple of months of 1994. There is a concern in the fund industry that when investors focus on their annual returns this year, they will discover they did not make any money and -- amazingly enough -- take money out. As a group, stock funds have not seen a month when investors took money out in more than four years.
 For a good part of 1994, the search was on for evidence of inflation. It was there in some industrial commodities, notably copper. But gold -- the eternal inflation hedge -- did nothing. And some farm commodities that leapt in 1993 fell back in 1994, with corn down almost 25 percent. Crude oil made a nice rally from depressed prices, but natural gas sank.
 Late in the year, action in the stock market made it look like recession, not inflation, might soon be the most feared threat, and economically sensitive stocks began to slip. Should the yield curve invert later this year -- that is, should short-term rates be higher than long-term rates -- the recession talk will intensify.
 For an investor who simply bought and held a big index like the Standard & Poor's 500, which was down a bit in price but slightly profitable when dividends were counted, the year as a whole was hardly an eye-opener.
 Maybe that is just as well, for it is getting more expensive just to get up in the morning. On the commodity markets, coffee was up 136 percent in 1994. And sugar leapt 41 percent.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1995: THE ECONOMY;
Patchy Fog Hovers Over the Northeast

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Across America, the economy of the 1990's is shaping up as the mirror image of the 1980's.
 A decade ago, California and the East Coast were booming; today, they lag behind the rest of the country. The Midwest, then known as the Rust Belt, buckled. Now an industrial revival is restoring much of the original finish to the region. 
Through much of the 1980's, blue-collar workers suffered as manufacturing underwent a painful restructuring to meet tougher world competition. In the 1990's, white-collar employees were lashed by a similar make-over of office-centered services.
 Remember the cold war? The nation's huge military buildup of the 1980's is now being matched by an equally rapid shrinkage of the military industry.
 The computer hardware surge of the last decade, symbolized by I.B.M. and Apple Computer Inc., has been supplanted by the software and networking revolution led by the Microsoft Corporation and Novell Inc.
 Wall Street remains on a roller coaster. Financial services slumped after the stock market crash in 1987. After a revival of the industry in the early 1990's, new traumas were created in 1994 by rising interest rates, the collapse of the bond market, the comeuppance of the hedge funds and the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif.
 And through the decades, people and jobs continued to be drawn to suburbia and to regions, like the South and the Rocky Mountain states, with a reputation for livable comfort.
 Having finally shaken off a severe recession, the Northeastern states are making a gradual economic comeback. But the incipient recovery is uneven and none of the states are back to their peak employment levels of the late 1980's. While Massachusetts, the strongest, is experiencing fairly robust job growth, in neighboring Connecticut there is almost none at all.
 Over all, the eight Northeastern states -- Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine and Rhode Island -- have just enjoyed their best year since 1988, immediately before the region plunged into a recession. The hard times did not really begin to lift until 1993.
 "The Northeast as a whole is no longer holding back the national economy," said Sara Johnson, a regional economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting and data gathering concern in Lexington, Mass.
 The mix of industries in each state seems to govern its prosperity. The Boston area, the heart of the Massachusetts economy, is a center for computer software companies, and they are booming. Financial service companies in Boston, particularly mutual fund companies, have been expanding and hiring all year. And construction is strong, especially the rebuilding of Interstate 93 through Boston, a federally financed multibillion-dollar project.
 New Hampshire was hit early in the decade by the collapse of several major banks, but now the banking industry is lending again. Construction is also making a comeback in the state.
 New York benefited from robust Wall Street hiring through most of 1994, but that started to falter by midsummer. Upstate, expanding paper and petrochemical companies helped various cities. But layoffs at Xerox, Eastman Kodak, Grumman and several other major corporations upstate and on Long Island have offset some of the gains.
 New Jersey also enjoyed greater prosperity, some of it from the transfer of back office operations by financial institutions away from Manhattan.
 The weak Canadian dollar meant fewer Canadian tourists in northern Vermont, dampening economic growth in that state. Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maine also lagged behind, but mostly because of cutbacks in military spending, particularly warship construction in all three states, and aerospace cutbacks in Connecticut, where Allied Signal and United Technologies are major military contractors.

HEADLINE: MARKETS & INVESTING: A Wild Ride for Emerging Markets;
Pacific Markets Wait for Dawn

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
The major markets in Europe generally did not do much last year, but there was plenty of action out on the volatile new frontiers of emerging markets, enriching some investors and impoverishing others.
 In Brazil, the Bovespa equity index finished the year up by well over half in dollar terms, and other markets in Peru and Chile were not far behind. But the losers were almost as conspicuous as the winners. The new stock markets in China's burgeoning cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen ended 1994 down by more than a third. The most embarrassing performance was turned in by Turkey's stock market, whose value was cut 49 percent over the year. The Turkish market was a big winner in 1993. 
In Europe, stock markets moved circumspectly in response to elections at home and skittishly in anticipation of rising interest rates in the United States. The weaker dollar against major currencies from Frankfurt to Tokyo made European and Japanese exports more expensive and left some industry stocks overpriced for foreigners.
 Swings in exchange rates also skewered market returns for foreign investors. Mexico's Bolsa ended the year off by nearly 41 percent, dragged down by the peso's devaluation. But the Nikkei index in Japan finished up 27 percent after the stronger Japanese yen moved into double digits against the dollar.
 Emerging markets promise the most exciting opportunities again in 1995, perhaps too exciting for the faint of heart.
 Everyone is talking about the dawning of the Pacific century, but this has not been the year of Pacific stock markets.
 After a string of successes, several stock markets in East Asia slumped in 1994 or saw their growth rates cut sharply. They fell victim to economic slowdowns, political uncertainty and, in some instances, economic bottlenecks that are threatening to slow growth in this otherwise dynamic region.
 Analysts say 1995 may bring more of the same. Investment experts are not losing hope in East Asia but they are tending to hedge their bets.
 In perhaps the most important sign of this attitude shift, some analysts are rediscovering an Asian market that had been given short shrift: Japan. A consensus is growing that Japan may be set for a sustained rebound as corporate profits take off.
 Tom Hill, an analyst at S. G. Warburg Securities (Japan), said that if Japan's nascent economic recovery remained on track, the earnings per share of companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange would soar 20 percent in the fiscal year ending March 31 and 55 percent in the following year.
 Mike Allen, a strategist here with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities, said his firm had shifted its focus slightly from the emerging markets of Southeast Asia toward Japan. The firm's model global portfolio has increased its holdings in Japan to 18 percent of the total from 14 percent.
 Part of the reason for the slight waning of interest in other Asian markets is the uncertain economic climate in the United States, Mr. Allen said. Any American slowdown could hit the export-dependent economies of Asia. But Japan is at the beginning of a recovery that appears likely to hold, he said.
 Mr. Allen said his firm still favored Taiwan and Indonesia but was less optimistic about Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand.
Kathy Matsui of Goldman, Sachs said her firm was somewhat more optimistic about East Asia.
 "Just about everything depends on whether the U.S. can create a soft landing," she said. "It could be very rocky in the short term as the Asian markets try to get a grip on what is happening." JAMES STERNGOLD

A Trim Heartland Flexes Its Muscles

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

Across America, the economy of the 1990's is shaping up as the mirror image of the 1980's.
 A decade ago, California and the East Coast were booming; today, they lag behind the rest of the country. The Midwest, then known as the Rust Belt, buckled. Now an industrial revival is restoring much of the original finish to the region.

After a revival of the industry in the early 1990's, new traumas were created in 1994 by rising interest rates, the collapse of the bond market, the comeuppance of the hedge funds and the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif.
 And through the decades, people and jobs continued to be drawn to suburbia and to regions, like the South and the Rocky Mountain states, with a reputation for livable comfort.
 After a year that exceeded most expectations, manufacturers, retailers and farmers in the Middle West are looking forward to another strong performance in 1995.
 Orders from auto makers, appliance companies and manufacturers of heavy trucks, rail equipment and construction machinery for components and equipment have factories humming -- and hiring -- from Pennsylvania to the Rockies. And the new jobs are expected to add enough to consumer spending power to protect regional retailers from sales declines despite rising interest rates.
 The manufacturers are reaping the benefits of their 1980's streamlining and of growing export markets. Caterpillar Inc., the strike-ridden Peoria, Ill., manufacturer of heavy construction machinery, expects record earnings this year regardless of how its labor woes play out.
 At the Inland Steel Company, which returned to profitability in 1994 after four years of losses, marketers are reveling in the challenges of allocating production among eager customers.
 A few manufacturers are constructing new factories at home, including Motorola Inc., which is building a $100 million cellular phone factory at Harvard, Ill., and the Whirlpool Corporation, which is spending at least as much on a new appliance factory near Tulsa, Okla.
 Many others, though, are counting on continuing profits from the current economic boom to finance expansion into faster-growing foreign markets, especially Asia and Latin America.
 Record harvests last year led the Agriculture Department to force farmers in its subsidy programs to take 7.5 percent of their corn land out of production this year. But agricultural experts say good weather could easily result in more big harvests because farmers will take their least productive land out of crops while continuing to upgrade equipment and seed quality.
 Net profits could decline, though, because the cost of fertilizer and other supplies is climbing.
 One bleak spot for many farmers is the price of pork, which has fallen below the cost of production. Agricultural economists say that many smaller producers may be driven out of business this year unless prices rebound sharply. BARNABY J. FEDER

HEADLINE: MARKETS & INVESTING;
A Market Guru Whose Advice Worked in Bad Times

BYLINE: By SUSAN ANTILLA

 BODY:
A standout performer among investment newsletter writers last year was a stock market bear whose most recent gains came thanks to a frothy market.
 But, in a business where gurus run hot then cold, perhaps more noteworthy is that this bear has managed to do well in markets good and bad. 
He is Norman Fosback, the editor of eight publications including New Issues, which gives opinions on the merits of soon-to-be-public companies. New Issues turned up among the winners not just for 1994, but for a period of more than seven years. Other Fosback publications have also done well over the long haul, suggesting that his good performance might be more than a case of being in the right place at the right time.
 An investor who diligently followed the advice of New Issues since August 1987 would have had a 132.8 percent portfolio gain, according to Mark Hulbert, whose Alexandria, Va., company ranks the performance of investment newsletter writers. That compares with a 72.8 percent total return for the Wilshire 5000 index, a broad stock gauge.
 For 1994 through November, Mr. Fosback's followers had a paper gain of 5.6 percent, while the Wilshire index dropped 1.4 percent.
 Only 14 of 72 newsletters beat the index both last year and over the longer period, according to Mr. Hulbert. (August 1987 was used as a starting date for a long-term track record because it includes the stock market crash later that year that devastated so many prognosticators.) Among the newsletters with winning performances in both periods, Mr. Fosback ranked No. 1.
 A proud winner? Not exactly. "I'd love to take the opportunity to criticize Mark's system when I come out on top," he says. "I have always disagreed with Hulbert's methodology, and I've particularly disagreed with him with regard to the way he rates the New Issues newsletter."
 So much for gratitude.
 Mr. Fosback isn't the only newsletter editor who takes issue with Mr. Hulbert's rankings, but he is one of the only long-term gainers willing to bite the hand that feeds him.
 When Mr. Hulbert began setting up computer models to follow the advice of newsletter writers in 1980, some of the worst performers declared all-out war, some bringing lawsuits. They did not like how Mr. Hulbert applied some of their investment advice. Among the practices they found irksome was Mr. Hulbert's using stock prices on the day a newsletter arrived in the mail -- as opposed to the date of publication.
 Still, some of the biggest grumblers have been swift to trumpet in their advertising the short periods when they have done well in the Hulbert rankings, evidently pleased with the system when it favors them.
 Mr. Fosback, though, continues to assail Mr. Hulbert, and to do well in the rankings. Although the lofty performance of New Issues could fizzle fast whenever the current boom in fresh stock offerings ends, Mr. Fosback's other publications from his Institute for Econometric Research in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., have done well, too.
 The Insiders, which recommends stocks based on the buying and selling by corporate officers at public companies, made the list of letters that beat the Wilshire 5000 since August 1987. Its recommendations gained 6.9 percent in the 11 months that ended Nov. 30, popping up on the list of winners among the 162 letters tracked in 1994 by Mr. Hulbert. The market picks of two other Fosback publications, Market Logic and Mutual Fund Forecaster, each gained 1.4 percent.
 In all, 54 newsletters beat the Wilshire index this year, led by The Timing Device, up 45.8 percent. For the seven-year period, 20 letters beat the Wilshire, led by OTC Insight, up 258.2 percent.
 Mr. Fosback expressed surprise that New Issues was the big winner when both periods were combined "because the deck is stacked against us." He complained that Mr. Hulbert did not give him credit for buying a new issue that went public, say, at $10 a share, if the stock began trading in the open market at a premium, say, $15 a share. "If we tell readers don't pay a premium on the initial public offering, Mark assumes we never bought it," Mr. Fosback said.
 Mr. Hulbert defends the practice, noting that real people trading in real markets simply cannot get the hot issues that immediately jump in price. "For me to give him credit at the initial public offering price is to give him too much benefit," Mr. Hulbert says.
 Investors eager to follow the advice of Mr. Fosback should select stocks cautiously -- sticking to his overall recommendation that less than half of investable assets be allocated to stocks. They might also take cues from the actions of corporate insiders. For example, executives at real estate, savings and loan, and utility companies have been big buyers of their own stocks lately, he said.
 Although Mr. Fosback does not recommend that investors sell short -- bet on falling prices by selling borrowed shares in the hope that they can be bought back cheaper -- he does note that executives of railroad and computer companies have been selling, suggesting that those are stocks to avoid.
 Mr. Fosback, who told investors in May 1992 to scale back their stock allocation to 50 percent of assets, cut that recommendation further to 40 percent in August.
 While some analysts are becoming less skittish about stocks as price-to-earnings ratios decline, Mr. Fosback sticks to his bearish stance. "Earnings are subject to the vagaries of accounting," he says, "so they just haven't been that reliable."
 He is most concerned that stock dividend yields are at relatively low levels -- just below 3 percent. "Dividends represent cold hard cash being paid out to stockholders by companies, so yields have historically been a consistent and sound basis for judging the financial health of companies," he said.
 And companies just aren't coughing up enough money right now to justify the high prices of their stocks, Mr. Fosback added.

For Funds in '94, There Was No Place to Hide

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
FOR the millions of Americans who invest in mutual funds, 1994 feels like the punchline of a not-very-funny joke.
 How bad was it? 
It was so bad that money market funds -- one step away from cash in the mattress -- proved to be the best class of investments.
 It was so bad that stock funds had a worse year than they did in 1987, when the market crashed.
 It was so bad that some supposedly safe fixed-income funds racked up double-digit losses, and long-term bonds turned in their worst performance of this century.
 It was so bad that with few exceptions, international investing just offered Americans new ways to say, "I lost money."
 So 1995 has got to be better, right?
 Well, maybe.
 Back-to-back bad years are not unknown in the stock market (1973 and 1974), and are even more common in bonds (where returns were negative every year from 1977 through 1980), according to data from Ibbotson Associates, a Chicago research firm.
 Few investment experts are expecting a banner year in 1995 -- and some actually expect the next 12 months to be even more awful than the last. In general, Wall Street's crystal balls seem even cloudier than usual.
 "It's a frustrating time -- you hear that from a lot of people," said Bettina Doulton, who runs Fidelity Advisor Equity Income and is one of the few money managers to navigate 1994's treacherous markets and end up with a gain. "Investors are trying to balance what they see in the economy, interest rates, and money flows, which is a big issue as we go into the year."
 To some extent, fund investors may hold the future in their own hands. The billions of dollars they poured into stock funds last year was one of the few bright spots, and may have been responsible for equities' relative strength as interest rates soared. True, domestic stock funds fell an average 1.6 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., but that loss pales in comparison to bond funds' negative 3.5 percent return. And those mediocre averages mask some really big hits: American Heritage, an aggressive stock fund, plunged 35 percent, and Piper Jaffray Institutional Government Income lost 28.5 percent because of heavy holdings of very volatile securities derived from mortgages.
 But the rout in bonds might not have been quite so bad if investors had not fled those funds, forcing managers to sell into a depressed market, which pushed prices down further. The downward spiral was especially pronounced in the thinly traded market for municipal bonds. Municipal funds were hit with a record wave of selling in November -- even before Orange County, Calif., became the biggest municipal bankruptcy in American history. Tax-exempt funds lost 5.8 percent last year; California and New York funds fared even worse.
 And the end of the carnage may not be in sight. "I'm still pretty negative, though 1995 won't be like 1994," said Laurie Kirby, who manages municipal bond funds for 20th Century Investors, which is better known for growth-stock investing but sponsors one of the year's top-performing tax-exempt bond funds.
 If, as she expects, munis rally a little this month, she plans to sell bonds and buy them back after the Federal Reserve raises interest rates again. "I still believe, even if the market doesn't, that long-term rates are going to 8.25 percent," she said, from their current rate of nearly 7.9 percent.
 A slightly more optimistic view comes from Hotchkis and Wiley, whose Low Duration fund's 5.2 percent return was the best among United States bond funds in 1994. "It's definitely not an environment where you jump in with all hands and legs," said Tad Rivelle, one of the fund's managers. "But given where rates are, you could lock in 7.5 percent for two years, 7.75 percent for five years."
 And that, he noted, is not a bad return, if you believe that the Fed will succeed in slowing the economy and in keeping inflation down. Mr. Rivelle and his partner, Laird Landmann, suspect that the Fed may do its work too well and that a recession may be on the horizon.
 Surprisingly strong earnings spurred one stock market sector: technology. Funds that specialize in high-tech zoomed 12.3 percent, the year's only double-digit gain.
 Over the long haul, which in technology investing is a year or two, high-tech funds ought to do well, even if the American economy slows, said Chris Toub, a portfolio manager for Alliance Capital Management, which runs a top technology fund. "Technology is a big export sector, and we are looking for Europe and the Far East to grow more next year than in '94," he said. But first, Mr. Toub said, he expects tech stocks to tumble, as investors take some of profits.
 Until late last month, another bright spot was international funds, which benefited from a rally in Japan and the decline of the dollar. Then Mexico devalued the peso, and many funds plunged. Among stock funds hit the hardest, with a loss of 23.7 percent for the year, was TCW/DW Latin American Growth, which is sold by Dean Witter and managed by Trust Company of the West. But Alliance North American Government fund, which buys debt, fared even worse, dropping more than 30 percent.
 That decline may signal an opportunity for investors like Helen Young Hayes, who manages international portfolios for Janus Capital. "Emerging markets generally I'm still very bullish on, as soon as short-term interest rates in the U.S. peak," she said. But individuals often have trouble taking such a contrarian tack: "They tend to buy at the top and sell at the bottom," she added.
 Which leads to the really big question of 1995: Will Americans continue to pile into stock funds? The fund industry says yes, arguing that the money is coming from people saving for far-off goals. But the flow of money did slow sharply in November, and dwindled to almost nothing last month, according to AMG Data Services, a firm that tracks funds in Arcata, Calif.
 Truth is, many investors pay attention only to year-end results. And those people will not much like what they see, even if their losses are relatively small. Particularly if they can make more than 5 percent a year without taking any risk, just by opting for a money market fund or bank certificate of deposit.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1995: THE ECONOMY;
Far From the Courtrooms, Tobacco's Rituals Endure

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
What is the 1995 outlook for tobacco? Fraught and turbulent, but not inevitably disastrous. If the industry was under a microscope in Washington last year, it is likely to be caught by television lights in 1995.
 For the first time, a class-action suit of smokers who say they are addicted and diseased is going ahead, in a Florida state court. So is a separate Florida class-action suit involving flight attendants who say they are ill from second-hand smoke. 
Furthermore, 60 powerhouse personal-injury law firms have banded together to concentrate on a class-action suit against the five largest American tobacco companies. It could represent all smokers, draw upon last spring's Congressional testimony contending that a cigarette company sought to addict smokers by deliberately manipulating the level of nicotine in cigarettes.
 Government regulatory action that could classify tobacco as an addictive drug, or ban it from all public spaces in the United States, is a possibility as well. But beyond the legal and legislative concerns, there is the person-to-person combat in the nation's offices, restaurants and public spaces, where smokers feel ever more like a persecuted minority.
 Indeed, only 25 percent of Americans smoke, the lowest level since the Government began taking surveys.
 Yet the five big cigarette makers remain feisty, confident and supremely unrepentant. After all, they are likely to face less-strident criticism in the new Republican Congress. And they are secure in the knowledge that in more than four decades of legal action, the tobacco makers have never paid monetary penalties. In contrast to previous successful class-action cases, as when the insurance companies pressured the asbestos makers to settle, tobacco companies have no insurance. And they have looked America straight in the eye and vowed never to settle.
 Despite the nervousness of investors about tobacco's downside potential, many analysts expect no basic alteration in the fundamental nature of the industry in 1995. This will reassure millions of Americans whose livelihood is dependent upon a crop that was first grown commercially in the United States in 1612 at a farm in Virginia.
 Still a mainstay of the economies of North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia, tobacco products generate $48 billion a year in revenue from the 1.68 billion pounds of tobacco harvested, produced and domestically distributed annually by 426,000 workers, according to the Tobacco Institute in a statistical report drawn from Agriculture Department data and audited by Price Waterhouse.
 America's seventh-largest cash crop produces 502 billion cigarettes and cigars, and generates excise and sales taxes of $13.3 billion for Federal, state and local governments. American tobacco exports earn an additional $6 billion a year.
 The rich fields are dormant now, marking time until late winter, when the seeds go into earth. This year's rhythms of cultivating, harvesting, curing, auctioning and manufacturing, though abetted by new technology, will be a replay of venerable rituals that have scarcely varied through the centuries.
 The life is as hard, and unpredictable, as it always was. It's just the society that has changed.

HEADLINE: MARKETS & INVESTING;
Derivatives Draw More Scrutiny

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Well, at least the financial system didn't collapse last year and cause worldwide chaos.
 For the beleaguered Wall Street rocket scientists who create and sell the newfangled deals broadly known as derivatives, that is as good as news got in 1994. 
Derivatives are a range of financial agreements with value linked to an underlying market like stock prices or interest rates. What differentiates derivatives from traditional investments like stocks and bonds is that they are custom designed for each user. They are often used to reduce risk -- to protect a company, for example, from a rise in the interest rates on its debt. But they can also be used as a substitute for direct investments to make speculative bets on the performance of a particular market.
 All of the dozens of problems that were revealed last year fit into that speculative category: betting that interest rates would remain stable while taking on a huge risk of losses if they rose.
 Such speculative bets may be fine for hedge funds charged with gambling with rich people's spare fun money, but they are not appropriate for next month's teachers' salaries.
 While the first reports in February of huge losses in derivatives came from sophisticated hedge funds, what followed was a steady stream of announcements of unusually large losses from investors and institutions, like Orange County, Calif., that were meant to have very conservative investment strategies.
 And so derivatives are far more controversial today than a year ago and subject to even more intense scrutiny from the Government. And, in fact, the fastest growing segment of the derivatives business these days is the consulting firms owned by former derivative traders, who specialize in what they call "financial forensics." They defuse derivative bets before they go bad, clean up the mess after a bad bet and try help companies avoid trouble in the future.
 For the Government, and the industry, there are two key issues: how the derivatives were sold and how they were bought.
 The issue that has gotten the most attention has been sales practices; questions have been raised about whether dealers properly explained the terms and risks of derivatives to their clients.
 In the case of Gibson Greetings Inc., the Government found that the Bankers Trust New York Corporation, one of the leading derivatives dealers, actually committed fraud by hiding losses on derivatives from Gibson for a period of two years. Gibson, a greeting card company in Cincinnati, lost $20 million.
 Although Bankers Trust does not admit guilt, it paid a fine to the Government of $10 million and settled with the company, covering $14 million of its losses.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which imposed sanctions on Bankers Trust, is trying to promulgate a code of conduct for derivatives dealers, which would require specific disclosures to customers of risk and the current value of derivatives.
 More attention will also be paid to whether the customers who buy derivatives have adequate controls in place to make sure they are not getting in over their heads. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is investigating whether certain investors that had been allowed to buy derivatives, such as mutual funds and municipalities, should be under more restrictions.
 And the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Gibson and some of the other companies that suffered derivatives losses adequately disclosed their positions to their investors.
 This scrutiny is a mixed blessing for Wall Street. New regulations and possible new laws may increase the cost of doing business and may limit the sales to certain types of customers.
 It certainly does not help the market, moreover, when the Government accuses a prominent derivatives dealer of fraud and many other customers claim losses.
 "The dealers are beleaguered," said Paul Spraos, editor of Swaps Monitor, a trade newsletter in New York.
 Still, many dealers say they think that the attention paid to derivatives may be beneficial in the long run.
 "Senior management for the first time had to look in detail at the issues raised," said Peter Hancock, the head of derivatives at J.P. Morgan & Company. "Once they get educated, the vast majority find that they are very satisfied they can use derivatives to avoid costs and reduce risk."
 For all the bad publicity, the derivatives business has not suffered as much as other parts of Wall Street. Profits from derivatives dealings are down about 15 percent compared to the boom year of 1993, Mr. Spraos estimates. Profits on Wall Street were down 80 percent during the first nine months of the year.
 And volume in the market continues to grow. Over all, the face value of all the derivatives contracts outstanding, Mr. Spraos said, increased to $12.3 trillion from $8.2 trillion at the end of 1993.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1995: THE ECONOMY;
A Quieter Hum In the Southwest

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Across America, the economy of the 1990's is shaping up as the mirror image of the 1980's.
 A decade ago, California and the East Coast were booming; today, they lag behind the rest of the country. The Midwest, then known as the Rust Belt, buckled. Now an industrial revival is restoring much of the original finish to the region. 
Through much of the 1980's, blue-collar workers suffered as manufacturing underwent a painful restructuring to meet tougher world competition. In the 1990's, white-collar employees were lashed by a similar make-over of office-centered services.
 Remember the cold war? The nation's huge military buildup of the 1980's is now being matched by an equally rapid shrinkage of the military industry.
 The computer hardware surge of the last decade, symbolized by I.B.M. and Apple Computer Inc., has been supplanted by the software and networking revolution led by the Microsoft Corporation and Novell Inc.
 Wall Street remains on a roller coaster. Financial services slumped after the stock market crash in 1987. After a revival of the industry in the early 1990's, new traumas were created in 1994 by rising interest rates, the collapse of the bond market, the comeuppance of the hedge funds and the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif.
 And through the decades, people and jobs continued to be drawn to suburbia and to regions, like the South and the Rocky Mountain states, with a reputation for livable comfort.
 The Southwest built, manufactured and traded its way to faster growth than the nation as a whole last year. This year, economists expect the region to stay ahead, but in a slower race.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas predicts that employment in Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico will grow by 2.8 percent to 3.4 percent this year, compared with 3.6 percent last year. Higher interest rates and an aging expansion, the bank says, will moderate the Southwest's growth. "A slowing national economy is reflected in the state," said Stephen Brown, the bank's senior economist, regarding Texas.
 The rig count may no longer be the prime guide to the region's outlook, but the petroleum industry could still determine whether the economy runs or just walks. Last year, low prices for oil and natural gas were a drag on the economies of Texas and Oklahoma. Corporate cost-cutting chopped thousands of petroleum industry jobs. In recent months, oil prices have recovered, but natural gas remains inexpensive.
 If the rest of the United States was deaf to Southwestern pleas for industry subsidies or import tariffs, Texans found new friends in Mexico. The nation's exports to Mexico soared after the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect a year ago. Nearly half those exports came from Texas, and nearly 75 percent rolled across on Texas highways.
 But now that the peso has been sharply devalued, making American goods more expensive in Mexico and raising doubts about the Mexican economic recovery, exports from the Southwest to Mexico could slow.
 Construction also promoted the Southwest's growth last year, as the region's appetite for new homes, warehouses and factories, if not downtown office space, sharpened. In the region as elsewhere, rising interest rates might start causing potential home buyers to think twice.
 Southwestern manufacturing, apart from military sales, is likely to continue expanding more rapidly than in the rest of the nation. Manufacturers still tend to favor a region where their dollars buy more labor and a higher standard of living than they can get in the country's cooler quarters. ALLEN R. MYERSON

HEADLINE: MEXICO'S RESCUE PACKAGE: THE OVERVIEW;
MEXICO'S LEADER GIVES THE NATION A RECOVERY PLAN

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 3

 BODY:
President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, who had promised Mexicans personal prosperity during his election campaign last year, announced an economic-stabilization plan today that reduces the purchasing power of workers, cuts corporate profit, trims the nation's budget and sells some state-owned resources.
Investors and financial analysts reacted cautiously to Mr. Zedillo's announcement, which had been delayed by unexpectedly strong resistance from labor union leaders. 
 Some analysts said the austerity measures were not strong enough to help Mexico recover from the shock of the peso's 30 percent devaluation and the flight of billions of dollars in foreign investment over the last two weeks. Others said they had hoped the President would address the worries of international investors more directly.
In a 25-minute address carried on national television, Mr. Zedillo, a 43-year-old Yale-educated economist, appealed to the Mexican people, trying to soften the edges of his harsh recovery plan with calls for patriotism and self-sacrifice.
"As President, I am perfectly aware that many of the measures and actions we must carry out are difficult," he said. "Nevertheless, I am also aware that those measures and actions are essential."
Mr. Zedillo's speech did nothing to impress the financial markets in New York or here in Mexico City. The Mexican stock exchange dropped 3.2 percent today to close at 2,278.47, down 75.77 points. In New York, American depository receipts of the bellwether Mexican stock, Telefonos de Mexico, lost 5.8 percent. The dollar rose to 5.275 pesos todayfrom 4.925 pesos on Monday.
"I don't think many people were impressed," said Jonathan Heath, director of Macro Asesoria Economica, a consulting firmhere. "In general, the market wanted more specifics."
Mr. Zedillo did briefly mention the aid offered by Mexico's international trading partners. This includes an $18 billion line of credit, half of it from the United States. Canada agreed to increase its credit line with Mexico to $1.5 billion (Canadian). The Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland, representing several European central banks, is making available a $5 billion credit line, and international commercial banks, including Citibank, are going to syndicate a $3 billion loan.
The Mexican central bank acknowledges that it holds $6.15 billion in international reserves it can use to avert further turmoil in the domestic financial market, buying pesos when the currency falls in value. Whatever funds Mexico uses would have to be repaid, with interest.
The agreement with its international partners prohibits the Mexican Government from using the credit lines to finance its $28 billion current-account deficit, a broad measure of trade, which has resulted from an excess of imports over exports in recent years.
The International Monetary Fund gave prompt approval to the Mexican plan. Stanley Fischer, the fund's acting managing director, said in a statement that the policies outlined today by Mr. Zedillo "show the capacity of authorities to respond promptly and effectively to economic and financial developments."
Mr. Zedillo's plan abandons the narrow trading band Mexico had used to restrict the currency-exchange rate and control inflation. Instead, the value of the peso will be determined by buyers and sellers in currency markets, as it has been since the Government was forced to allow it to float freely on the night of Dec. 21.
To address another big problem, the Government says it is working with investment banks to come up with new bonds that offer longer terms and higher rates. The intention of such bonds is to encourage investors not to pull out any more of the $7 billion in treasury bonds that fall due by the end of March.
Mr. Zedillo's speech was postponed from Monday night after union leaders had maintained their strong objections to the harsh terms of the plan. Today, they dropped their opposition, though not their reservations, and signed the pact.
"It's the workers who once more are bearing the greatest cost," said Elba Esther Gordillo, general secretary of the national teachers' Union.
In September, the unions had signed a somewhat similar agreement with Government and business that allowed a 7 percent wage increase for 1995. That agreement also included income-tax credits for the lowest-paid workers and some productivity bonuses in contracts.
The 7 percent wage package was considered a good deal then because the Government estimated that inflation would be only 4 percent this year. With the loss of purchasing power and rises in prices resulting from the peso's devaluation, Government economists now think inflation might reach 15 percent in 1995, and some private economists say it will exceed 20 percent.
Mexican workers still have not recovered the standard of living they had in 1980, now three devaluations ago. Francisco Hernandez Juarez, general secretary of the union representing telephone workers, a major labor figure, said that he, too, thought it was unfair to ask workers to sacrifice again. But he finally accepted the Government's terms, he said, because he was convinced that it was the only way for Mexico to overcome its current crisis.
The pact signed by labor and business groups today retains the 7 percent wage increase. In exchange, the Government pledged to minimize price increases and keep inflation from spiraling.
But the strong price controls that some investors had hoped to see were not included in the plan. Instead, businesses agreed to make "an extraordinary effort to mitigate price increases by reducing profit margins." Prices for imported goods could still increase by as much as 30 percent to compensate for the peso's devaluation, officials said.
The Government agreed to gradual rises of no more than 10 percent in prices for electricity, gasoline and most other goods and services it provides.It also plans to cut in half the trade deficit of $28 billion expected for 1994. Costlier imports and cheaper exports resulting from the devaluation of the peso are expected to help reduce the trade imbalance.
The 1995 federal budget will be reduced by 1.3 percent of the gross domestic product, representing a cut of about 7 percent in Government spending. Officials said they expected to end up with a modest surplus.
But economists in the United States questioned those estimates. "I just don't see how they get that," said James M. Nash, chief Latin American economist for Nomura Research Institute America. Mr. Nash said the budget cut would have to be almost double the Government's figure to achieve such savings and produce a surplus.
Mexico also plans to raise money by selling some of its companies and services to private owners. Investors are likely to be interested in the nation's telecommunications satellites and in plans to accelerate the opening of local and long-distance telephone markets to competition.
There is likely to be far less interest in the Government's plans to sell parts of the creaky national railroad or four seaports that often lose money. Mr. Zedillo did not mention any plans to privatize the Government-owned oil monopoly, Pemex, although it is believed that petrochemical plants and natural-gas pipelines offered for sale once before, without success, will be put on sale again.
"I was expecting something more," said Juan-Carlos Garcia, an analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York, alluding to the privatizations.
Mr. Zedillo accepted responsibility for the sacrifices that he asked every Mexican to make.
"Before any concern for the presidential image or the renown of public officials, my commitment is to act responsibly, without evading or trying to conceal reality," he said.

Chart: "The Austerity Measures"
 Mexico's effort to guide an overvalued currency gently downward collapsed in December from the combined weight of a swelling trade deficit and a stampede of foreign investors pulling their money out of Mexican stocks and bonds. After two weeks of intense negotiations with business leaders, trade unions and creditors, the Zedillo Government has put together a package of steps to see the country through the crisis. The chart outlines this package. (pg. D4) (Source: Mexican Government)

HEADLINE: Brazil's Horizons Widening With New Common Market

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Brazil, South America's industrial giant, has just won more legroom with the start of the Southern Common Market, a customs union that expands by 50 percent the duty-free area open to Brazilian manufacturers.
On New Year's Day, tariffs were ended on 95 percent of goods traded among Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. At the same time, the four neighbors adopted common tariffs -- averaging 12 percent -- for goods imported from outside their borders. 
 "Brazil has just discovered its Canada," a Brazilian ambassador exulted. "Argentina is Brazil's natural extension south, in the same way that Canada is the United States' natural extension north."
Brazilian exporters and investors have been quick to follow the diplomats. In the four years since the Southern Common Market treaty was signed and a gradual reduction in tariffs began, regional trade has more than tripled, reaching $12 billion in 1994.
Once a hostile rival of Argentina, Brazil has become its largest trading partner, displacing the United States; Argentina is now the leading recipient of Brazilian foreign investment.
"Three years ago, it was almost unimaginable that this could happen," Brazil's new President, Fernando Enrique Cardozo, said here Monday. "Yet, today, we are in a full customs union."
With flights now shuttling hourly between Buenos Aires and Sao Paulo, manufacturers calculate their economies of scale according to the size of the new, expanded market -- 190 million people and $800 billion in economic activity. Largely forgotten is the skeptical talk that once lampooned the Southern Common Market as "a club of the poor."
"There are now over 300 joint business ventures between Brazil and Argentina," said Jose Artur Denot Medeiros, Brazil's negotiator for the common market, known in Portuguese as Mercosul, a contraction for Southern Common Market. "Five years ago, there were only 5 or 10 Brazilian companies in Buenos Aires."
Brazil's South American trade and investment drive seems destined to accelerate after the inauguration on Sunday of Mr. Cardozo, a former Foreign Minister and the first Brazilian President in modern times to speak Spanish.
"It will make South America one of the most dynamic, growing areas of the world," Mr. Medeiros said of an expanding network of free-trade agreements that is to be called the South American Free Trade Area. Last month in Miami, hemispheric leaders agreed to negotiate during the next decade the formation of a free-trade area that would stretch from Alaska to Argentina.
As President-elect, Mr. Cardozo visited the capitals of Brazil's three Mercosul partners in November. On Monday, his first day on the job, he was host at a meeting of the four Presidents of the southern market countries along with the Presidents of Chile and Bolivia, two neighbors that have promised to sign free-trade treaties with the Southern Common Market by June.
"Let's forget a little about the 19th century and start looking at the 21st century," Bolivia's President, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, said, referring to national barriers that split South America after independence from Spain and Portugal in the early 1800's. "There is a lot of enthusiasm for moving toward a united region, not separated by borders."
By the end of this year, free-trade treaties are to link the southern market with the four remaining Spanish-speaking nations of the continent -- Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.
"Peru's economy is already getting ready to join Mercosul in two or three years," Peru's President, Alberto K. Fujimori, said after meeting with President Cardozo here on Monday.
Betting on the duty-free zone, Bolivia is promoting a plan to supply natural gas to the region. Under this plan, pipelines are to built over the next five years from Bolivia to Brazil, to Paraguay and to northern Chile. A gas line already links Bolivia and Argentina.

HEADLINE: Part-Time College Teaching Rises, as Do Worries

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CLAREMONT, Calif., Jan. 2

 BODY:
They call themselves "freeway fliers," the Ph.D. graduates who cannot find full-time faculty teaching jobs and who spend their days commuting back and forth among part-time jobs at various colleges where they have no certainty of employment from one semester to the next.
They are a sign of the times as colleges and universities seek economies by leaving staff jobs vacant, relying on part-time teachers to fill the gaps and save them money on higher salaries and benefits. And they have aroused debate in academia over whether institutions have acted responsibly in turning out so many highly qualified specialists only to leave them stranded. 
 "In one day I drive 100 miles and teach 100 students at three different colleges," said Susan Imbarrato, an English instructor who has been commuting this way for five years. "I feel like this information machine, sort of Teach "R" Us. What are we doing in our cars, all these Ph.D.'s on the freeways, listening to talk radio?"
At the annual convention of the Modern Language Association last week in San Diego, the group's president, Patricia Meyer Spacks, called the growing reliance on part-time college instructors an urgent problem. Their schedules, she said, are "insanely demanding."
David Merkowitz, a spokesman for the American Council on Education, which represents 1,600 colleges and universities, said the use of part-time faculty members had risen sharply in the 1990's after cutbacks in state support for higher education. He said more than half of the colleges had increased their use in 1993 and another one-third last year.
About 40 percent of the college faculty members today are part-timers, twice as many as two decades ago, said Jack H. Schuster, professor of education and public policy at the Claremont Graduate School, who has studied the numbers for the Modern Language Association. Among these part-timers, he said, "the raw numbers of frustrated would-be full-time faculty members has surely expanded considerably in recent years."
The situation, Professor Schuster said, is the result of a delay in the expected widespread retirement of professors hired in the 1960's and the slowness of many institutions in replacing those who do retire.
The retirements are inevitable over the next decade or more, he said, and should coincide with the increase in college enrollments predicted by demographers, creating an active job market. But several experts said that with graduate schools continuing to turn out more specialists, Ms. Imbarrato's generation of scholars could fall through the cracks.
"I walk around and I think, All I want to do is teach," said Ms. Imbarrato, who specializes in early American literature. "It's not like I want to rob a bank. What else can I do with a Ph.D. in English?"
This is how she describes her schedule:
"I remember last year I taught at 8 A.M., drove 30 miles from Claremont to Cal State, taught two hours, had office hours, got back in my car and drove 20 miles to teach a community college class. Then I would get back in the car, eat a candy bar and drink some juice and drive 20 miles back to the campus I was at in the morning. I'd get caffeinated, walk in and teach another two hours."
The exhaustion of driving back and forth while full-time teachers can meet with students, work on committees and produce their own academic work is compounded by a daily diet of humiliation, some part-timers said.
They must accept the early morning and late evening classes, they said, and even these offers often do not come until days before a semester starts. Their colleagues often do not know their names, they added, and their students sometimes treat them with less respect.
"The worst thing is the sense of alienation," said Amanda Donta, a 31-year-old English instructor who has been a part-timer for six years and is now working on a master's degree in classical flute performance.
"I don't even have a phone extension," she said. "All I have is a mailbox, and it changes every term. Once it was a Cheez Whiz box, just a cardboard Cheez Whiz box. That was my home base."
People like Ms. Imbarrato and Ms. Donta sometimes juggle the schedules of different colleges on the quarter and semester systems. For each course they are paid a fee that ranges from about $900 a semester at a community college to as much as $3,000 at a private college. Together, the patchwork of classes they put together may equal the annual $28,000 to $30,000 starting salary for a Ph.D. at a California state college.
By using part-time instructors, several of them said, colleges can avoid providing the benefits they would be entitled to if they had more than a minimum teaching load.
Iris Molotsky, a spokeswoman for the American Association of University professors, agreed. "Administrators say they use part-time faculty because they want greater flexibility," she said. "But the reality is that these people are just hired over and over again. What they really want is not to pay health benefits and life insurance and so on. It's just exploitation."
Professor Schuster said the nationwide proportion of part-time college faculty members, also known as gypsies or nomads, had risen to the current 40 percent from about 33 percent in the mid-1980's and 22 percent in the early 1970's.
By the year 2008, he calculated, nearly half the 595,000 full-time college faculty members in the nation are likely to retire. But he said it appeared clear from current trends that not all would be replaced by full-time teachers.
As college faculty hiring has slowed sharply, the number of people seeking jobs in higher education has risen, said William Zumeta, a professor at the graduate school of public affairs at the University of Washington.
"In the last five years or so the numbers of Ph.D.'s granted in this country has jumped by about 5,000 a year, up from about 33,000, where it was for a long time, to about 38,000," Professor Zumeta said. "More people are seeking fewer jobs."
These job-seekers make up 15 percent to 20 percent of part-time faculty members, said Howard Tuckman, dean of the college of business at Virginia Commonwealth University, who has written books on part-time faculty members.
Dr. Tuckman has dubbed them part-mooners, as opposed to full-mooners, who may have a full-time job in another field, as lawyers or businessmen or journalists, or may be spouses of full-time faculty members or writers who are happy with a part-time teaching job.
Some institutions, like junior colleges, rely more heavily than others on part-time faculty members. At California State University at San Bernardino, Ms. Imbarrato is one of 237 part-timers on a faculty that totals 626. At Pomona College last semester, she was one of just 20 part-timers on a faculty of 180.
Though part-time faculty members may bring high qualifications and enthusiasm to their jobs, an increasing reliance on their work could do long-term damage to academic institutions, said Emory Elliott, the former head of the English department at Princeton University, who now teaches English at the University of California at Riverside.
"A pretty important shift has happened in the last five years that is clearest in California," Professor Elliott said. "The senior ranks of the professoriate are being really emptied by early retirements, and not only are they not being replaced but there is no plan to replace them because people are not working their way up through the system."
A result, he said, is that some departments have no senior faculty members to give them focus or to direct graduate studies.
Some part-time professors settle in for years, like Jean Mather, who said she had "flown the freeways" since 1981 and called her part-time arrangements, which earn her about $25,000 a year, "the perfect job for a mom with a family."
Some, like Deborah Dietrich, who managed to compose an article for publication while she drove on the freeways, do win full-time jobs. She is now an assistant professor of English at California State at Fullerton.
Others, like Julie LaMay Abner, keep driving and hoping.
Ms. Abner, 36, who specializes in Native American literature, has been a freeway flier for three years. She calculated that she traveled 758 miles every five-day week last semester to classes at various institutions, including Boron Men's Prison in Boron, Calif.
"We are not guaranteed any more employment from one semester to the next," she said, "so every semester we have to be dynamic and energetic and productive and not complain.
"But I do have a goal in life. My goal in life -- my ultimate goal -- is to drive somewhere, park my car, teach all day, get in my car and drive home. That's it."

HEADLINE: Girls Don't Want To Have Gym

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J.

 BODY:
WHEN asked to describe how they felt about gym class, nearly all of the 15 teen-age girls wrinkled their noses with disgust.
"When I was little, I used to love it," said Rachael Ludlow, 15, a sophomore at Edison High School. "But most girls don't like to mess up their hair, to get changed or like, you know, be bothered." 
 Sports were no more popular. Neither were workout videotapes, health clubs or long walks. These girls are far from alone.
Indeed, a national increase in inactivity among all age groups seems especially pronounced among teen-age girls and is leading them on a path toward obesity and serious health problems that will linger into adulthood, health and nutrition experts say.
Making matters even more worrisome, surveys also show that teen-age girls are continuing to smoke at high rates and are using drugs as frequently as boys do -- habits that make them less likely to be active.
According to recent research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, only 25 percent of female high school seniors exercise vigorously on a regular basis, compared with 50 percent of boys the same age. Although there are no figures on girls' exercise habits in the 1980's, the researchers believe that girls are becoming less active. The centers cited a fitness survey that showed that in 1990, only 37 percent of students in grades 10 through 12 exercised vigorously, down from 68 percent in 1984.
While the reasons for the laziness elude many scientists, they blame a combination of factors that can stymie anyone's efforts to slim down, including watching television and eating inexpensive high-fat foods.
Girls are at a particular disadvantage, the experts said, for reasons as varied as a lack of engaging athletic programs to the needs of their working parents, who want them to pitch in more at home, leaving little time for physical recreation.
"Teen-age girls feel they shouldn't sweat," said Dr. William Dietz, director of the Boston Obesity/Nutrition Research Center. "As a country, we have a lot of cause for worry over that, because the propensity for obesity is epidemic, and the consequences for health-care costs could be enormous."
According to recent studies of the exercise patterns of high school students, teen-age girls drop away from sports or exercise activities steadily as they age. "I just don't want to do all that exercise," said Rebecca Alexander, 16, another Edison High School student. "I just feel too lazy."
In a 1990 survey of 11,000 students and in follow-up research done as recently as this year, the Centers for Disease Control found that 35 percent of ninth-grade girls participated in 20 minutes of "vigorous activity" three times a week, compared with 53 percent of their male classmates. The numbers decreased to 25 and 50 percent respectively for the youths once they reached their senior year. Because adolescence is the time that young women begin to get more body fat, these exercise patterns contribute greatly to their battles with unwanted weight gain.
"It was disappointing to see that the pattern of activity dropped over grade levels," said Dr. Gregory Heath, an epidemiologist at the centers. "If indeed we are sowing a sedentary life style, it will likely carry over into adulthood, and what we are going to reap are the effects, like an increase in diabetes, obesity and heart disease."
In discussions with dozens of girls at Edison High School, many of them said that between the pressures of school and the needs of their working parents for help around the house, little time was left at the end of their days for running and jumping.
"When you go home from school at night," said Angela Carrizosa, a 16-year-old freshman, "you have dishes to do, the house to clean and you have homework. There really isn't time for anything else."
She is required to take a gym class for at least one-quarter of the school year, she said, but that is the extent to which she exerts herself.
According to the Centers for Disease Control study, at greatest risk were black girls, who rated lowest on activity scales, and children who lived in poor neighborhoods. While there were some patterns among girls of the same race or ethnic group, researchers said that one of the most significant correlations with exercise was economic class.
"In the private school in the Chicago area, we found that the upper-middle-class girls were extremely competitive," said Wynn Updyke, the assistant dean for academic affairs and research in the School of Health, Physical Education and Recreation at Indiana University in Bloomington, which conducted a study on the recreational habits of 3,000 children in five cities.
"In the inner city, we saw that girls were not competitive at all," Mr. Updyke said. "We observed that if one girl did poorly in physical testing, the rest of the group would do poorly, too, just to not make her feel bad." A lack of resources and safe parks and little access to things like private tennis lessons and nice swimming pools contributed to the disparity, he said.
Mr. Updyke also noted that Hispanic girls in Chicago, often from new immigrant groups, tended to be far less active than Hispanic girls in California, because children of newer immigrants were expected to stay home and care for younger children, rather than play sports.
Girls are not only less active than boys, but are also less likely to quit smoking. "We would have expected to see a continuing decline as we do with adults," said Dr. Michael Eriksen, the director of the office on smoking and health at the Centers for Disease Control. "But we've virtually stopped making progress to get teens to stop. In 1993, the office found that more than 18 percent of female high school seniors smoked every day, about the same number as in 1988. The use of cigarettes as a weight control tool by young girls is extremely serious."
And in a recent survey by the National Institute on Drug Use, researchers found that teen-age girls were steadily using more marijuana, cocaine and LSD than they were about four years ago. Among 10th-grade girls, for example, 28 percent were said to use marijuana, nearly double the figure for 1992.
In interviews, girls sheepishly raised their hands when asked if they smoked pot, and all hands went up when they were asked if their friends used drugs. "People here do smoke a lot of pot," said Kori Scott, 15. "For them, it is a feeling of pleasure, and then they don't care about what they do."
Something has to fill the void left when the textbooks are closed and the dinner dishes have been washed, and it is often television.
While the authors of the Centers for Disease Control study stressed that they were unable to demonstrate a direct link between television watching and poor health, they did note that girls who were vigorously active were less likely to watch as much television as their peers who were physically inactive.
But beyond a decrease in physical education programs (the centers found that only 19 percent of female students went to a gym class every day, and Illinois is the only state that requires physical education), many experts talk about less tangible forms of pressure that leave young women conflicted and in trouble.
"Girls are no longer supposed to be submissive, and there is more pressure to succeed academically now," said Kelly Brownell, a professor of psychology at Yale University. "Fewer of them have parents around to pay attention to them, and there is more danger in their reactions to stress."
Many of the girls talked about the conflict of trying to meet their parents' expectations while still appearing attractive to boys, who they said still expected girls to keep to traditional roles.
"The boys here always say, 'My wife is going to be home cooking me dinner when I get home,' " said Stella Kim, an 18-year-old senior. "Then they laugh. But we know they're serious."
And despite a lack of interest in exercise, girls still express an obsession with weight loss.
"Heaven forbid you should ask for a size 9, or even a 7, when everyone else is in a 5," said Christie Zehnder, a senior, referring to the yearly cheerleading squad ritual of picking out short little skirts.
Still, the few girls who expressed an interest in physical activity said they exercised with gusto. One girl practices karate several hours a week, and others are three-season athletes.
Kristie Titcomb, a tiny 15-year-old sophomore, said that karate made her feel invulnerable. "Guys don't really like it," she said. "My boyfriend gets annoyed if I hit him, but I will only use this stuff if I have to."

HEADLINE: Red Phillips, 74, A Basketball Star With City College

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Claude (Red) Phillips, a former New York City high school basketball star who gained wider fame when he teamed with Red Holzman to form an indomitable backcourt combination at City College in the early 1940's, died in New York last Wednesday. He was 74.
Robert Williams, the president of the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame, said the cause was a heart attack. 
 Mr. Phillips, who was inducted into the hall in September, was a native of Harlem who combined with another noted teammate, William (Pop) Gates, to lead Benjamin Franklin High School to the Public Schools Athletic League championship in 1938.
But it was under Nat Holman at City College that Phillips, playing alongside Holzman, emerged as a dazzling guard.
During the two Phillips-Holzman seasons, 1940-41 and 1941-42, City College had records of 17-5 and 16-3, plus at least one other distinction, according to Holzman: The Beavers never lost to another New York City college.
"I was the passer, and he was the shooter," said Holzman, the former Knick coach, who ranked Phillips among the game's great guards, alongside two Basketball Hall of Fame members, Bob Davies and Bobby Wanzer of the Rochester Royals, with whom Holzman played professionally.
Phillips's chance for a professional career was dashed by the economic realities of the day: marriage and the need for a steady job. With the newly created National Basketball Association offering an uncertain financial future, Mr. Phillips became a New York City policeman, rising to the rank of sergeant before spending 11 years as the chief senior inspector of the New York State Drug Abuse Control Program.
He is survived by three sons, Claude Jr., Sidney and Alvin, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Official Quits AT&T To Run A Software Company

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

 BODY:
One of the AT&T Corporation's top executives announced yesterday that he was quitting as president of the company's Global Information Solutions subsidiary, less than two years after he took the job and midway through his effort to turn around the struggling $7 billion computer unit.
The executive, Jerre L. Stead, will become chief executive of the Legent Corporation, a computer software company in Herndon, Va., with sales of $501 million -- a small fraction of the size of the AT&T subsidiary, which was previously known as the NCR Corporation. 
 The move surprised many analysts, because Mr. Stead, who is 51, had been viewed as a star at AT&T who had previously orchestrated a turnaround at its business communication products division and appeared to be having success at the computer unit.
Some industry analysts said Mr. Stead's departure could jeopardize efforts to revitalize Global Information Solutions, which has been AT&T's poorest-performing unit for the last few years. Mr. Stead, who was put in charge of the company in May 1993, has cut jobs while refocusing the company on new markets and putting a stronger emphasis on reaching out to customers.
"This is a big loss for AT&T here," said George F. Colony, president of Forrester Research, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. "This is the time they should be accelerating, and they need Jerre as a coach. The turnaround at GIS was so personality-driven."
The departure also appeared to surprise AT&T's top management. The AT&T chairman and chief executive, Robert E. Allen, said the company had not settled on a permanent replacement. William O'Shea, a longtime AT&T executive who is head of worldwide marketing at the Global Information Solutions, will take over as interim president.
For his part, Mr. Stead said he could not resist the opportunity to take charge of an entire company. "The Legent opportunity was unique, and one I was delighted to take part in," he said in an interview yesterday.
AT&T executives dismissed concerns about Mr. Stead's departure, saying the computer company was on its way to executing the strategy that Mr. Stead and others had devised.
"We have a strategy we are absolutely convinced is right," Mr. O'Shea said. "Our focus now is on executing the plans we've put in place."
The Global Information Solutions division has performed poorly since the company acquired it for $7.5 billion in 1991, though it had gained ground in the last year. Based in Dayton, Ohio, it was in the process of shifting from proprietary mainframe computers to "open" systems that run software from many vendors and a family of machines built around the Intel Corporation's microprocessors.
But the company had struggled with high costs and slumping sales overseas, which led to several quarterly losses. Mr. Stead was brought in to set things right.
The results have begun to show, though the task is not complete. After losing $172 million in 1993 on sales of $7.2 billion, Global Information Solutions broke even for most of 1994. Analysts say the company will show a profit for the final quarter of 1994, on sales approaching $8 billion.
Mr. Stead's decision is a big boost for Legent, a company that made its name developing system management software to run large mainframe computers more efficiently. Legent had been searching for a new chief since last August, when its chief executive, John F. Burton, announced that he would not renew his contract when it expired this March.
Mr. Stead will earn a base salary of $750,000 a year and will receive stock options to buy up to 700,000 shares of Legent stock -- about 2 percent of the company -- at its closing price last Friday: $28.75 a share.
At AT&T, Mr. Stead received $1.2 million in salary and other cash compensation, as well as stock options and other "long-term incentives" valued at $425,250.
"It's hard to turn down the C.E.O. job at a major company," said Daniel P. Reingold, a telecommunications analyst for Merrill Lynch, adding that Mr. Stead was unlikely to have succeeded Mr. Allen as chairman of AT&T. "There are a lot of major jobs at AT&T, but there is only one guy who can get the top job."
Mr. Stead said Legent was poised for rapid growth, saying that it had a niche in providing software to bridge the gap between old-fashioned "legacy" systems based on mainframe computers and newer distributed networks built around microprocessors and smaller computers.
The company has shifted in recent years to develop products for networks of microprocessor-based computers, known as client-server networks, but much of the business is still based on older mainframes.
Legent grew rapidly during the 1980's, but its profits have been erratic in recent years.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Metals, Oil and Grain Fall On a Spate of Profit Taking

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Commodity futures prices fell broadly yesterday as speculators took profits in markets bloated by a holiday-season rally. Precious metals, copper, crude oil and cotton all fell sharply.
Most grain futures also retreated, but cattle rose to a nearly nine-month high. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 products fell 1.88 points, to 234.76. 
 "I think people have returned from the holidays with the idea interest rates have not peaked yet," said James Steel, an analyst for a big commodities-brokerage firm, Refco Inc., "but growth in general may be slowing down. That combination is anti-inflationary, which is definitely hitting the precious metals, and it's not that good for the industrial commodities."
Gold and other precious metals are traditionally regarded as a hedge against inflation.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, gold for February delivery fell $3.50, to $380.90 an ounce, and March silver plunged 15.5 cents, to $4.762 an ounce.
March copper fell 4.9 cents, to $1.337 a pound.
All three metals had posted strong gains in recent weeks. Copper, which is heavily used in the electronics and construction industries, had reached a six-year high on Friday.
Analysts also cited profit taking in the energy markets after a two-week advance in crude oil prices.
On the New York Merc, light sweet crude oil for February delivery fell 32 cents, to $17.44 a barrel; February heating oil dropped 1.29 cents, to 49.94 cents a gallon; February unleaded gasoline was off 1.03 cents, at 52.75 cents a gallon, and February natural gas dropped 4.2 cents, to $1.683 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Cotton futures fell sharply on the New York Cotton Exchange from the three-and-a-half-year highs reached last week. March deliveries dropped the permitted daily limit of 2 cents, to 88.35 cents a pound.
Corn and soybean futures sagged, and wheat futures fell sharply. March wheat plunged 6 cents, to $3.955 a bushel; March corn fell 2.5 cents, to $2.285 a bushel; March oats rose 3.75 cents, to $1.255 a bushel, and January soybeans fell 3 cents, to $5.4775 a bushel.
Cattle futures climbed above 73 cents a pound for the first time since April on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, driven by meatpackers' strong demand.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises as Traders See Higher Rates as More Likely

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most leading currencies yesterday as a report indicating an increase in inflation heightened expectations of higher interest rates ahead.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.5565 German marks, down from 1.5597 marks in European trading on Monday, but up from 1.5495 marks in New York on Friday. The dollar rose to 100.68 Japanese yen, from 99.58 yen on Friday. The British pound slipped to $1.5630, from $1.5647 on Friday. 
 Foreign-exchange desks were closed for the New Year's holiday in many countries on Monday, but trading was conducted in several others, including Germany and Italy.
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported yesterday that its prices-paid index surged last month to its highest level in almost 14 years, rising to 83 percent from 77.9 percent in November.
"The prices-paid component spooked some people," said Richard Vullo, currency sales manager at the Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank in New York.
While United States bond prices fell after the report, the increase in the price index reassured currency dealers that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates again at a meeting of its policy-making committee on Jan. 31-Feb. 1. The Fed has raised short-term rates six times since February.
Another rate increase is expected to bolster the dollar, market participants said. "There's still a slight bias toward a higher dollar, because it still looks like we'll see higher interest rates," said Belal Khan, chief customer dealer at the Bank of Tokyo in New York.
Rising interest rates often help a currency by making bonds and bank deposits denominated in the currency more attractive.
Yesterday, for example, one-month Eurodollar deposits yielded 5.94 percent, compared with 5.13 percent for one-month Euromark deposits and 2.31 percent for Euroyen deposits.
The dollar's rise against the yen yesterday resulted from speculative traders purchasing marks for yen, market participants said. To accomplish such a transaction, traders frequently buy dollars for yen and then sell the dollars for marks.
Traders continued to monitor the Mexican peso, although they said it was not having much impact on the dollar against other currencies. In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 5.2750 pesos, up from 4.925 pesos yesterday.

HEADLINE: MEXICO'S RESCUE PACKAGE: THE IMPLICATIONS;
A Darker Side for U.S. In the Mexican Solution

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Just before the peso crisis began two weeks ago, Clinton Administration officials celebrated the anniversary of the approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement by proudly announcing the first fruits of victory: Mexico had overtaken Japan as the No. 2 consumer of American exports.
Now the Administration is facing the darker side of the broad economic alliance it pressed so hard to bring to pass. To restore confidence in the Mexican economy, it has supported -- and helped shape -- a plan that is almost certain to cut back the pace at which American goods flow across the border. Moreover, it is a plan that seems certain to increase the inducements for Mexican workers to come to the United States illegally. 
 For one thing, the decision announced today by President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon to let the peso float freely at its devalued levels will mean that American wages are now about 30 percent more valuable to Mexican workers than they were just a few weeks ago.
The result, Administration officials conceded today, will likely be visible within weeks along the 2,000-mile-long border. In the name of stabilizing the Mexican economy over the next year or two, Mr. Clinton's aides have decided to run the risk of another wave of illegal immigration into regions of the United States that are growing increasingly intolerant of the cost it imposes on American workers and taxpayers.
"In the end there is no choice," one Administration official who has been involved in the growing trade with Mexico said today. "Mexico has become an integral part of the North American market. That started way before Nafta. The two economies are intertwined in trade, in commerce, in the movement of people. And in the end, the bigger need is to have a stable country on our border."
Throughout the currency crisis, the White House has been acutely aware that while the political stakes are enormous for Mr. Zedillo; they may also loom large for Mr. Clinton.
After a contentious debate in the fall of 1993 before approval, the North American trade agreement faded as an issue, costing Mr. Clinton little. But that calculation may now change, especially in Texas and California, two states that are critical to his re-election hopes. Many residents there are among those most suspicious that they are paying the price for helping Mexico overcome its economic problems. Opponents of the trade accord, who said American workers would be hurt more than they were helped, may look more prescient in coming months if the flow of both low-priced goods and low-wage immigrants from Mexico to the United States sharply increases.
"The Clinton Administration has fallen into the same trap as the Reagan and Bush Administrations," said Jeffrey J. Schott, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, who has written extensively about the benefits of the trade accord. "It has been forced to oversell the effects of a trade deal on American economic growth. And sometimes, it comes back to haunt you."
Certainly there is good news as well for Washington in the economic recovery package announced today by Mr. Zedillo, who has been in office for less than a month. Mr. Zedillo's insistence that unions agree to wage increases of no more than 7 percent, and that corporations keep their profits minimal in an effort to keep prices down, seem likely to cut off the momentum of devaluation and inflation that many feared could cause the economy to spin out of control.
More important, Mr. Zedillo has chosen to speed changes in the economy that the North American Free Trade Accord set in motion. He is allowing private investment in railroads and satellite operations, promising to further liberalize foreign investment rules and promoting more competition in domestic telephone services.
All those steps are likely to eventually benefit American companies racing for a firmer foothold in the Mexican economy. In some areas, Mr. Zedillo is handing Washington openings it sought -- and was denied -- when the trade agreement was negotiated under the Bush Administration.
The Mexican President is also hoping to wean his country from its dependence on short-term investments to finance its current-account deficit -- the difference between what it takes in from exports and what it pays for imports and to meet its foreign-debt obligations. Those investments make the economy more vulnerable to market speculators, who helped send the peso on its fall.
Instead, Mr. Zedillo hopes to pay for Mexico's deficit with more direct investment from foreign companies, getting them to build factories and businesses in the country. That may be more attractive than ever, because the cost of investing in Mexico has declined by a third.
But American companies will have to be convinced that Mr. Zedillo has the unions and the country's elite behind him. They also have to be persuaded that they will not suffer a similar fate to that of investors of recent months and years, who have been hit with millions of dollars in losses in the last two weeks.
And they must learn to live with slower growth -- much slower than the 4 to 6 percent growth that Mr. Zedillo was confidently predicting in Washington a few weeks ago, before his inauguration.
Such problems, of course, are not inherent to investors in Mexico. China, the largest potential investment market of all for American companies, already has a surging inflation rate of 24 percent and seems ripe for a Mexico-style market correction. Throughout much of Eastern Europe, the kinds of tough economic choices that Mexico deferred during its presidential election last year have also been avoided.
But as President Clinton learned during the national debate in 1993 over the North American trade deal, there is something special about Mexico. The specter of more illegal immigration and of political trouble on the United States' border gives a vivid immediacy to the country's economic troubles that outweigh Mexico's size or influence on the American economy.
What the Clinton White House still has not learned, some experts contend, is that its much touted foreign economic policy must be approached like arms control: The focus has to be on prevention, not response.
"What we need now is a new method for consultation and support between the two countries to reduce the likelihood that problems like this become crises," said Robert A. Pastor, the director of the Latin American and Caribbean program at the Carter Center at Emory University in Atlanta. "That will be the most important long-term change."

HEADLINE: Survey of Manufacturers Shows Growth Is Slowing

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Growth among United States manufacturers weakened moderately in December, one of the first signs that the economy is starting to lose strength from higher interest rates, a trade group's survey indicated yesterday.
Still, the survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management showed that manufacturing continued to expand, even if at a slower pace. Moreover, inflation at the producer level rose, giving the Federal Reserve Board more justification to raise interest rates again, according to economists who reviewed the survey results. 
 The association, which conducts the survey of executives who do the buying for the nation's factories, said its index of manufacturing growth fell to 57.8 percent in December from 61.2 percent in November.
The December number was both the lowest reading and the first monthly drop in the index since August.
Manufacturing has been one of the strongest parts of the economy, and analysts said the report was among the first significant indications of a general slowdown. Data from the housing industry released last week showed that higher interest rates had slowed sales. The Federal Reserve Board raised rates six times last year to restrain the economy's brisk expansion.
"This is one of the first signs, other than the housing sector, that the economy is slowing," David Bostian, an economist at Herzog, Heine, Geduld, a New York investment firm, said of yesterday's report.
A index at 57.8 percent still signifies that manufacturing is expanding. A reading of more than 50 percent indicates an expansion of industrial activity, while a reading of less than 50 percent indicates a decline.
Coupled with the report's evidence of rising prices for factories, the growth index provides support for another rate increase when the Fed's policy makers meet at the end of this month, economists said.
"Even though the report showed a contraction in growth, it's still relatively high," said Kathleen Stephansen, senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities.
The purchasing managers assocation surveys managers at more than 300 industrial companies.
The association's price index surged to 83 percent in December from 77.9 percent in November. TheDecember figure was the highest since March 1980 and represented the fourth rise in five months.
The number of companies reporting higher prices also grew. Seventy-one percent of survey respondents paid higher materials prices, compared with 68 percent in November.
Despite the higher inflation component, other pieces of the survey showed weakness.
Factory production increased at its lowest rate in three months. The level of new orders grew, but at a slower pace than in November. The order backlog, an indication of manufacturers' ability to keep up with demand, increased at a lower rate than in the preceding month.
In addition, factory employment declined in December after three consecutive months of growth.

HEADLINE: MEXICO'S RESCUE PACKAGE: THE PRICE;
Chemical Tells of Big Peso Loss

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Chemical Bank said yesterday that a foreign exchange trader in New York had lost $70 million while making unauthorized deals in Mexican pesos.
The loss will cut the bank's fourth-quarter trading revenue by $40 million after taxes, the bank said. 
 Chemical said the trader had made trades in excess of his authorized limits and hid the transactions from the bank. A Chemical spokesman declined to identify the trader.
A person familiar with the bank identified the trader as Victor Gomez, a vice president in the foreign exchange group and a Chemical employee for five years. Mr. Gomez has been dismissed, the person said. No other employees have been dismissed, but the bank is continuing its investigation. Mr. Gomez could not be reached for comment.
Chemical's unexpected peso holdings became vulnerable after the sudden devaluation of the peso on Dec. 20 and its subsequent further fall. The peso closed yesterday at 5.275 to the dollar, down 34 percent from its level a month ago.
The devaluation and the subsequent sharp decline in stock and bond markets throughout Latin America are likely to cause some problems for most banks and brokerage firms. But in contrast to the Latin debt crisis of a decade ago, the banks' losses will be limited because few have invested large sums of their own money in Latin securities. The losses will be much larger for mutual funds and other investors that bought large amounts of Mexican stocks and bonds from the banks.
The person familiar with the bank said that Mr. Gomez operated under strict risk limits that stipulated that whenever he bought pesos from a customer he was immediately to find someone to sell them to, avoiding both big gains or losses. Apparently, he entered false trades into Chemical's computer system indicating he had sold pesos when in fact he had not, the person said.
 Chemical's problem somewhat resembles the plight of Kidder, Peabody & Company, which said last year that one of its government bond traders, Orlando Joseph Jett, had entered phantom trades that created $350 million in false profits.
 Other banks and brokerage firms have had problems caused by traders who did transactions but did not report them promptly. The largest of these involved a trader of mortgage-backed securities at Merrill Lynch who hid two deals in 1987 that eventually caused a $377 million loss for Merrill.
Traders who have amassed big losses are tempted to hide their positions in hopes of gaining time to recoup their losses by placing bigger bets than they are allowed.
 It is unclear what the motivation was for Mr. Gomez. But in August, he told the Reuters news service that he expected the peso to rise in value after Mexico's presidential election if there was a victory by Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Mr. Zedillo did win the election and took office on Dec. 1, three weeks before Mexico's currency crisis erupted.
 Chemical, which is one of the largest currency dealers, is active in trading pesos. The biggest peso dealers, however, are the Mexican banks and Citibank, which is the only United States-based bank with significant operations in Mexico. Mexican banks have a trading advantage because they can buy and sell pesos from Mexico's central bank.
Investors discounted the report from Chemical. Shares of the Chemical Banking Corporation rose 37.5 cents yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, to $36.25, a gain in line with that of other bank stocks.
 "It's not all that significant, because everyone has basically known that trading in emerging markets would be foul this quarter," said Frank R. DeSantis Jr., a bank-stock analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
 "You do stop and wonder what went wrong from a control standpoint," Mr. DeSantis added. "It's not a good thing, but I seriously doubt that this is indicative of a control problem at Chemical."
 Even before the peso devaluation, large trading banks like J. P. Morgan & Company and Bankers Trust said that their trading profits would be down in the fourth quarter from the already-depressed levels of the third quarter.
 While the large banks and brokerage firms will probably take some losses from their Mexican and other Latin American securities, investors have been prepared for these. Moreover, Latin debt is a relatively small portion of most banks' business, compared with securities and derivatives from from developed markets
 "Many banks will be bruised in emerging markets, but their overall trading numbers will be down, but not negative," Mr. DeSantis said.
 Other analysts and fund managers, however, said that Chemical's loss was not an isolated incident, but rather the tip of the iceberg.
"Given that the devaluation was a complete surprise and all the firms have been making a big push to get into emerging markets, there will be significant losses," said a Latin American strategist at a securities company who insisted on anonymity.
Banks and Wall Street companies holding so-called Brady bonds, named after the former Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who created them to help overhaul Latin American debt, have also seen losses as the bonds' values have plunged.
Still, the losses may not be cataclysmic for commercial banks in part because Mexican, not American banks, dominated the trade in pesos. As a result, the Mexican banks were more likely to have large peso holdings. when their value started to plunge. In addition, the value of the peso had become increasingly volatile over the last two years, causing banks and securities companies to hedge their positions. For example, holders of tesobonos, short-term bonds that are peso-denominated but indexed to the dollar, have virtually no currency risk because Mexico is bound to repay the dollar value of the debt at whatever the exchange rate is when they mature.
"If people were playing the game the way they had been for the last two years, there won't be a large amount of damage," said an investment banker who specializes in emerging markets and insisted on anonymity. However, if they began speculating after the peso began its slide, they may have been seriously hurt, he added.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Fewer Dividends Being Trimmed

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
American companies are making fewer cuts in or omissions of dividends than at any time in at least four decades -- a confirmation of the strength of the economy and of corporate profits.
But even as companies are cutting back on this kind of bad news, they are showing signs of being less willing to send out good news -- even when higher profits would seem to justify larger dividends. That could indicate that board room optimism about the economy has peaked and is starting to turn lower. 
 The Standard & Poor's Corporation reported yesterday that just 136 companies sent bad news about dividends in 1994, with 77 omitting payouts and 59 reducing them. That was down 30 percent from 1993 and 67 percent below the recession year of 1990, when 409 companies sent out bad news.
At the same time, 1,826 companies announced dividend increases, the highest for any year since 1983. That was up 12 percent from 1993 and was 45 percent above the 1990 figure.
But while 1994 was a banner year, the pace of the increase in dividends slowed. In 1992 and 1993, the number of companies announcing dividend increases rose 23 percent each year.
Arnold Kaufman, the editor of S.& P.'s Outlook newsletter, noted that the fourth quarter saw the same number of companies raise dividends as had done so a year earlier. "In view of the many double-digit earnings gains indicated for 1994, it was something of a surprise that the number of dividend increases" was not larger, he said.
Mr. Kaufman also said that 173 companies announced increases in December, just two more than in the December 1993, while the November figure fell to 155, a decline of 19 from November 1993. For the quarter, there were 493 increases, the same as in the last quarter of 1993.
It was the first time since the third quarter of 1991 that a quarter had failed to show an increase in the number of companies raising payouts.
Actions on dividends often lag behind corporate results because companies hate to cut payouts. So corporate boards often delay increases until they are sure that the higher level of profits will endure, and the slowdown in the growth of increases may indicate that some companies are less confident about the future.
Another measure of dividend activity is the payout on the S.& P. 500, or more accurately on the 500 stocks that make up the index. The figure is computed on the assumption that an investor owns fractional shares in each stock, with a total value at the end of the year of $459.27, the level of the index. That individual would have collected $13.18 in dividends during the year, up 4.8 percent from the $12.58 paid in 1993.
With the increases recorded during the year, 1994 ended with the S.& P. 500 paying at an annual rate of $13.31, the amount owners would get in 1994 if none of the 500 changed their payout rates during the year. That would provide a yield of 2.9 percent.
That rate is low by historical standards, but well above the 2.75 percent low reached early last February, when stock prices were peaking but dividend payouts were lower. The only previous times the S.& P. 500 payouts had dipped that low were in January 1973 and August 1987, both market peaks that were followed by sharp selloffs.
Prices came down from that level, but not by nearly as much as in the past. To bears, that reflects the impact of public investors rushing into equity mutual funds and thereby sustaining high valuations. Bulls, however, argue that dividends are not as important as they used to be.
They note that many companies -- exact statistics are hard to come by -- use share repurchases to get money to shareholders. That is said to be better because dividends are taxed at ordinary income tax rates, while the proceeds from share repurchases become capital gains for those who sell, taxed at a rate that now is lower for many taxpayers and is likely to go down even further if the Republicans who control Congress keep a campaign promise.
Dividend cuts are unambiguous bad news, and are often resisted by corporate boards and managements that hope things will turn around. So it is no surprise that they fall to low levels a couple of years into an economic recovery, after all the damage from the previous recession has had ample time to be recognized.
In the years since 1955, when S.& P. began collecting the figures on companies raising and cutting dividends, the lowest figure for companies providing bad news came in 1973, when just 151 reductions and omissions were announced. That figure was held down by the fact that in earlier years dividend increases had been held back by Federal wage and price controls, meaning that many companies had forgone increases that they might have had to reconsider.
The number of dividend omissions in 1994 was just 77, also a low for the period since 1955, while the number of reductions, 59, was the lowest since 1979.
Because many companies make dividend decisions once a year, there is a heavy seasonal trend to the results. And it is in the first quarter that the most decisions are made, as companies act after getting results for the previous year.
In the first quarter of 1994, the number of companies raising payouts was 551, up 24 percent from the same level of 1993 and the highest for any quarter since the first quarter of 1981. Topping that number this year will be a tall order, and failure to do so could indicate that corporate managements are less optimistic than they were a year ago.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
Many Facing Hard '95 Remain Determined to Give

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
In the first days of 1995, many New Yorkers are wondering how impending government budget cuts and an unstable economy will affect their lives. Some have not yet recovered jobs lost during the long recession. Others depend on publicly financed health or child care programs that face decreases in financing.
Letters to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund suggest many donors will face hardships of their own in 1995. But even among those with uncertain futures, the spirit of giving persists. 
 "We had a bad year, but probably not as bad as some of the people who you will see to it receive this check," wrote Randy and Sidney Friedfertig of Manhattan, who sent $50 to the fund. "Maybe next year, it will be more."
Several months ago, Harriet Hendel of Highland Mills, N.Y., lost her job as a special-education teacher because of downsizing. But she could not break a 28-year-old tradition of contributing to Neediest Cases.
"For the first time in 30 years I am out of work," wrote Mrs. Hendel, who sent $25 with her husband, Stan. "But I count myself lucky, as I have a husband to support me. I wish my contribution could be greater, but it is all I can give at this time."
Since 1911, the Neediest Cases Fund has helped the city's poor, sick, disabled and elderly. Contributions are split among seven charities and used for services like foster care, homeless shelters and job rehabilitation for the disabled. The fund also provides food, clothing and rent money for people who find themselves in unexpected crises.
Since Thanksgiving, the fund has received gifts totaling $2,749,926.10 from thousands of individuals and foundations. And while large donations might seem more important, smaller gifts from thousands of concerned individuals ultimately make the greatest difference.
While many donors write of the long-term troubles they face, others describe sudden bits of bad luck that complicated their lives in 1994. In December, Dennis Appleton was robbed of several hundred dollars on the street. But the incident did not deter him from sending his annual gift of $365 -- a dollar a day -- to Neediest Cases.
"After the initial anger passed, I decided that I was not going to let this incident transform me into the very stereotype of a New Yorker I have always worked so hard to avoid becoming," wrote Mr. Appleton, a Manhattan resident. "And so, it is with special defiant pleasure that I can again find that 'dollar a day' out of my life to send to your fund."
Some donors have no source of income other than gifts -- or in the case of children, allowances. But still, they are eager to share their wealth.
"As sisters, we do not have money of our own to give away," wrote Sister Mary Michael, a nun with the Sisters of St. Margaret in Manhattan. "The enclosed check represents money given me for Christmas." She sent $50.
For Julia and James Hall of Brooklyn, personal struggles made them realize the importance of giving what they could to help solve the city's broader problems. Last month, the Brooklyn couple sent $200 to Neediest Cases.
"At a time when our 'improving economy' is adversely affecting my husband and me -- along with legions of others -- we are impelled to double our contribution," the Halls wrote. "The crying need seems to more than double every year."

HEADLINE: Pataki to Stress Basic Themes in State of the State Address

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Only three days after his inauguration, Gov. George E. Pataki will restate his priorities and set the tone for his relationship with the Legislature in his first State of the State address on Wednesday.
Unlike his predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, who used his State of the State speeches to catalogue a vast range of legislative initiatives, Mr. Pataki is expected to stick to the basic themes he repeated throughout his campaign and transition: tax cuts, controlling state spending, work requirements for welfare recipients, reducing Medicaid costs, privatization, restoration of the death penalty, ending parole for violent felons, ending work release, term limits and giving citizens the right to petition for ballot initiatives. 
 "I think people are going to be amazed by the consistency of the message," Mr. Pataki told reporters on Monday. "I hope it doesn't make your lives too boring, but the things we talked about are the things we believe in and we believe them very deeply. They're going to be continually hammered home until the changes we talked about in fact occur."
Many of Mr. Pataki's advisers have urged him to stick to the few issues that most concern voters: taxes, jobs and crime. "There are a lot of second- and third-level issues that he will be forced to deal with as Governor, but that's not where he's going to spend his time and energy," said Thomas W. Carroll, president of the anti-tax group Change-N.Y. "You can't mobilize the public behind a 400-point agenda."
Pataki advisers said they expected Mr. Pataki to announce few new detailed proposals in his first address to the Legislature.
For instance, rather than recommending which state assets and services should be privatized, Mr. Pataki is expected to announce that Ronald S. Lauder will lead a commission to study the issue, according to Nelson Warfield, an aide to Mr. Lauder.
Mr. Lauder, a cosmetics executive and a 1989 candidate for mayor of New York City, headed a similar commission for the Republican-led State Senate in 1991. But few of that commission's recommendations, including the sale of La Guardia and John F. Kennedy International Airports, were carried out during Mario M. Cuomo's administration.
Early in the speechwriting process, Pataki aides considered using the speech to propose a merger of the Health and Social Services Departments, state officials said today. The departments are two of the largest in state government, and they share some similar functions, primarily in administering the Medicaid system.
But Mr. Pataki's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, said tonight that the proposal would not be included in the speech. Ms. Mucha would not say whether Mr. Pataki was inclined to endorse the proposal, which has been recommended over the years by several groups studying ways to streamline state government.
Mr. Pataki and his advisers worked feverishly on the speech throughout the day, even while traveling by helicopter to and from the funeral of Assemblyman Angelo Del Toro in Manhattan. Mr. Pataki had been scheduled to rehearse the 30-minute speech in a locked Assembly chamber early this evening, but the practice session was delayed indefinitely as he continued to make revisions.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who attended last year's State of the State speech by Mr. Cuomo, will not return for Wednesday's address because of scheduling conflicts and because he traveled here three days ago for the inaugural, said Cristyne F. Lategano, Mr. Giuliani's press secretary.
Mr. Pataki, who spent eight years in the Assembly and two in the Senate, has pledged to lobby lawmakers more directly than Mr. Cuomo, who dealt primarily with legislative leaders. If he cannot forge a consensus with the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, particularly on his fiscal proposals, he may try to build a majority by persuading 20 Democrats to join the 56 Assembly Republicans.
The chief fight with Mr. Silver is likely to revolve around Mr. Pataki's proposal to cut income taxes by 25 percent over four years. Mr. Silver has said that he is not averse to tax-cutting in principle but that such a large cut may be unaffordable and that cuts in other taxes might be preferable.
Chastened by the experience of 1987, Mr. Silver has recommended that Mr. Pataki propose his tax cuts one year at a time, rather than tying the Legislature to a four-year plan that may be difficult to sustain if economic conditions worsen. In 1987, the Legislature and Mr. Cuomo enacted a five-year, phased-in reduction of income taxes, only to defer the last two years of the plan for the last five years.
But Mr. Pataki has been advised by many of his top aides to push for legislation in the first year that would lock the entire tax cut plan in place.
Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, released calculations today showing that 32 percent of the state's taxpayers would receive a tax increase under the 1987 plan, including 54 percent of those with incomes below $40,000. Mr. Brodsky said that 98 percent of the reduction in taxes would benefit taxpayers with incomes above $40,000.

HEADLINE: Day One

 BODY:
On the first day of the 104th Congress, the new Republican majority will immediately pass the following major reforms, aimed at restoring the faith and trust of the American people in their government.
That promise is part of the House Republicans' "Contract With America," and the first day of the Republican-controlled 104th Congress is today. The House agenda for this afternoon calls for 20 minutes' debate and a vote on each of eight reforms. 
 Six of the reforms, aimed at reshaping the way the House does its day-to-day business, are healthy attempts to make it a more efficient and open institution. Regrettably, neither these rules nor any other part of the contract addresses big-money campaign financing or the freedom of members to take lobbyists' gifts -- though the Democrats may try to force the question of a gift ban.
The two proposals that bear on the actual substance of legislation -- as distinct from procedure -- are harmful. One, profoundly undemocratic and possibly unconstitutional, would defy majority rule on bills to raise taxes; the other would introduce misleading budget calculations.
Topping the agenda is a worthy proposal to eliminate 3 committees, 25 subcommittees and 600 committee staff employees. At the least, that could make the House more cost-efficient, which is also the aim of a second item -- a comprehensive outside audit to search out Congressional "waste, fraud and abuse." A third proposal, aimed at breaking authoritarian rule by senior members, would impose a six-year limit on committee chairmanships and an eight-year limit for the Speaker. Two others would limit the frequency of closed committee meetings and require committee members to vote in person, not by proxy.
The two proposals that deal with fiscal matters are bad policy. One would require a three-fifths majority to raise taxes, allowing a two-fifths-plus-one minority to block the majority. Since the contract also promises a balanced budget by 2002, the three-fifths rule would seem to mandate steep spending cuts, because it would make it almost impossible to legislate higher taxes. Those cuts would fall heavily on programs for the poor.
The other fiscal reform is called "Truth-in-Budgeting." Under existing rules, if a program's budget expands by no more than the rate of inflation, it is not counted as an increase in spending because the new funding only covers the higher cost of the same services. The new rule would count as an increase new spending that simply tries to keep pace with inflation. It would enable conservatives to ridicule liberal colleagues as "big spenders" even if they vote only to protect existing benefits.
The measures that the full House will consider and presumably adopt today have already been approved by its new Republican majority in party conference last month. They would change the way the House operates, but would not directly affect the Senate, where the "Contract With America" does not apply and the new Republican majority is considerably less fired up. But the three-fifths rule on taxes could nonetheless frustrate Senate action, because it would govern House voting on bills negotiated in House-Senate conference committees.
In one case -- a responsible proposal to make members obey laws they impose on the rest of America -- the House Republican leadership wants to adopt it in two forms, as a rule for the House and as a bill to become law for both houses, the Library of Congress and the other Congressional agencies. It makes more sense as law, so the same conditions prevail throughout the Congressional branch.
The Republicans have the strength to pass the whole package. It is a shame they have added harmful budget legislation to their useful reforms.

HEADLINE: In America;
A Reckless Journey

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
In a segment of "Eyes on the Prize," the brilliant documentary series on the civil rights movement, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is shown at a press conference, saying, "There is nothing more dangerous than to build a society with a large segment of people in that society who feel that they have no stake in it, who feel that they have nothing to lose."
Aristotle understood this. "Poverty," he said, "is the parent of revolution and crime." 
 In some sense, the American people understand it. A national survey conducted last fall showed that 72 percent of Americans believe that reducing poverty would help reduce racial tension and crime.
And yet, in a reckless new journey, with maps scrawled by sneering, cynical men with an utter contempt for history, the nation is moving fast toward policies guaranteed to increase poverty and suffering and to expand radically that dangerous segment of the population that feels it has nothing to lose.
Henry Hampton, executive producer of "Eyes on the Prize" and "The Great Depression," has completed a five-hour documentary series called "America's War on Poverty," which will appear on PBS on Jan. 16, 17 and 18. It's an honest look at a period in American history that has been profoundly misrepresented, distorted and lied about by politicians and others who have built marvelous careers exploiting misery.
Mr. Hampton's series arrives at a crucial moment. The number of Americans in poverty is growing, as is the number of middle-class Americans who are falling into poverty. One might have expected a sense of urgency to develop, a sense that these are serious problems that must be dealt with -- trends that must be reversed. Instead, the opposite is happening. The newest and most successful leaders in government have gotten where they are by promising to mug the poor.
"It seems to me so obvious that we have to do something about poverty," said Mr. Hampton during an interview at the headquarters of his production company, Blackside Inc., in Boston. "But this obvious need to act is buried in this litany that we've heard for so long: 'They don't want to work, they're taking your money, they want to sit and drink and watch television.' That kind of blatant appeal continues to work."
An "unconditional war on poverty" was declared by President Lyndon Johnson in his State of the Union address on Jan. 8, 1964. It was an appeal to the best in America at a time when the country seemed economically strong, militarily powerful and, in some quarters, deeply idealistic. It was also a time when the nation was hurtling into the tragedy of Vietnam, and when violence at home was eroding important reserves of good will and depriving the nation of some of its greatest leaders.
The war on poverty went forward but it was handicapped. Nevertheless there was progress. A companion volume to Mr. Hampton's series points out that in 1965, some 33.2 million Americans -- 17 percent of the population -- lived in poverty. By 1973, both the absolute numbers and the rate of poverty had declined, to 23 million and 11 percent, respectively. And then came the reversal. By 1988, after eight years of the Reagan revolution and its cruel assault on social services, the number of people in poverty had risen to 31.9 million, or 13.1 percent of the population, and the numbers are still rising.
It would have been enormously helpful to the country and to the various segments of its population if we had built on the successes of the war on poverty (there were many) and learned from the failures, which should have been corrected or eliminated. That is not what happened. Cheap politics and widespread ill will prevailed. The poor got poorer and, according to a study that looked at the years 1978 to 1986, the percentage of adults in the middle class in that period declined from 75 to 67 percent.
The rich got richer, of course. And the demagogues -- who do all in their power to foment hatred of the lower classes -- flourished.
This won't go on indefinitely. At some point a reckoning is inevitable. Echoing Dr. King, Mr. Hampton said, "A nation cannot live peaceably when the gap between affluence and poverty becomes as wide as ours is becoming."

HEADLINE: Computer Error Has a Snowball Effect

 BODY:
To the Editor:
John Hockenberry's rather blithe "Pentium and Our Crisis of Faith" (Op-Ed, Dec. 28) will mislead readers into believing that an arithmetic error in the 16th decimal place is nothing to get bent out of shape about. I am referring to his remark "it's hard to imagine how this kind of accuracy matters." Then he asks: "When was the last time anyone checked the 16th decimal place of an economic forecast in Washington or in a corporate boardroom?" 
 What makes the problem with the Pentium chip serious is the growth in error that takes place in computations involving a long series of arithmetic steps, especially if those include highly nonlinear mathematical functions. Many computer programs, from those used in economic and weather forecasting to those that perform geometrical calculations for computer graphics and fluid-flow simulations, do not produce their results after a single division, but only after the data are processed by a long sequence of steps, each able to cause a diminution in accuracy from the previous step.
While all computers possess only finite precision, that precision has to be enough so that for all the intended applications of the machine the growth in error that takes place as computations are cascaded on data stays within bounds.

HEADLINE: Orange County Sales Set

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Salomon Brothers said yesterday that it would auction nearly $1.5 billion in corporate securities this week from the Orange County, Calif., investment fund.
Orange County declared bankruptcy on Dec. 6 after disclosing huge investment losses, now estimated at more than $2 billion, in its portfolio. The county is selling off its securities to restructure its investment portfolio. 
 The investment pool's losses were caused by investments made on the assumption that interest rates would fall, but they rose instead.
Salomon, the county's financial adviser, said it would auction today $458 million of corporate securities, made up of medium-term notes from Ford Motor Credit and Salomon Inc. Tomorrow, Salomon will auction up to $1.08 billion of structured corporate securities, which may include derivatives.
The amount of securities for tomorrow's auction constitutes substantially all of the county's holdings of the structured corporate securities.
The county has sold off more than $4.5 billion in investments and collateral and sharply cut its exposure to interest rate swings.
Separately, Orange County officials said they were negotiating the sale or swap of risky securities to two Government-sponsored enterprises, the Federal Home Loan Bank System and the Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae.
Just last week, the county completed a $634 million sale of structured notes to the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae.

BYLINE: By Morris Newman 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
A TEAM of developers and architects has been selected to build a commercial and residential project in South-Central Los Angeles in an attempt to revitalize an area devastated by neglect and the riots of nearly three years ago.
The project is the fruit of an effort by businesses to promote growth in an inner-city area. Officials of the First Interstate Bank selected a site in the neighborhood and sponsored a design competition. 
 Bank officials said they hoped the 58,000-square-foot project on South Vermont Avenue would serve as a prototype for similar projects that could restore commercial activity to Vermont, a wide thoroughfare that was formerly a busy streetcar route and one of the leading commercial strips of South Los Angeles.
The project combines office space, stores and 35 town houses. The $11 million budget represents "the largest single investment in the area, in dollar terms, in the last quarter-century," said City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who served on a panel that picked the project from several offered by competing teams of architects and developers.
Building the project is a team made up of the Caleb Development Corporation of Los Angeles; the architectural firm of Solomon Inc. of San Francisco; the Related Companies of California, a Los Angeles-based developer; John Maloney Architecture of Santa Monica, Calif.; S. J. Amoroso Inc. of Irvine, Calif., a contractor, and the Related Management Company of Palmdale, Calif., a property manager.
South Vermont Avenue is a wide, formerly gracious street now pocked with vacant lots, serving as reminders of the properties that burned in the 1992 disturbances.
"In some ways, South Vermont is the inner-city problem par excellence," said Dan Solomon, a principal of Solomon Inc. "It has gone through waves of disinvestment and isolation, and had the life bled out of it."
The 75,000-square-foot First Interstate property posed a challenge for architects because it straddles the middle-class Vermont Knolls residential neighborhood on one side and the depressed thoroughfare on the other. When the bank first announced its intent to finance a mixed-use project with affordable housing on the site, the homeowners of Vermont Knolls were angered by their belief that the project would bring in low-income renters.
The finished project attempts to resolve that quarrel by providing about 7,000 square feet of retail space, enough for about seven stores, and by offering homes in the affordable range for sale rather than rental housing.
The winning design envisions a row of houses behind the commercial space with access available from an alley behind the project. Other housing units are set above the street-level stores. Office space is to be provided in a refurbished Art Deco tower, a neighborhood landmark built in 1931.
The Business Expansion Network, staffed by the University of Southern California School of Business Administration, plans to provide office space for fledgling businesses, some of which are expected to take root on Vermont Avenue.
The effort is part of a $2 billion program in depressed areas of Los Angeles that First Interstate began in March 1993, nearly a year after many businesses in the area were burned and looted. Construction is scheduled to start on the project in midyear.
After announcing the competition in 1994, First Interstate received 66 entries and whittled that number down to three finalists, each of which was required to put together a development team. The finalists were also required to glean from community meetings a better sense of what residents wanted in the project. A panel largely composed of residents chose the winning project in December.
"One of our motivations in doing this competition was to become more visible in South-Central Los Angeles, so we have more opportunities to do more financings," said John Gray, the bank's executive vice president in charge of commercial real estate lending in California. "We hope this project is the catalyst to start other developments and we'd be very happy to finance those," said.
Mr. Solomon, the architect, speaking to the design panel in December, cautioned that the project must not attempt "the unlikely the impossible or the unknown."
"Each of its parts should be simple to finance, simple to build and simple to market," he said.

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT'S NEW GOVERNOR: THE OVERVIEW;
ROWLAND AVOIDS PARTISAN APPEAL

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 4

 BODY:
While Republicans around the nation were basking in their newly-won power, John G. Rowland, the first Republican governor of Connecticut in 20 years, took office today with a speech that never mentioned his party, avoided appeals to partisanship and called on legislators to work together as a team.
In the State of the State address that Mr. Rowland delivered this afternoon, he did not include the more strident language of his campaign. He did not mention throwing people off the welfare roles or fume about possible court-enforced busing. 
 Instead, the 37-year-old Mr. Rowland, once considered the most conservative member of the Connecticut Congressional delegation, said he wanted to "help our young and old, our ill and our afflicted, when they need help and have no other resources." He described welfare reform in broad terms that no one could reject, saying, "A sense of civility dictates that we can and should help our neighbors, but a sense of individual accountability and responsibility must permeate a work ethic here in Connecticut." [Excerpts, page B8.]
On education, Mr. Rowland, the youngest governor in Connecticut history, did not refer to the controversial court case in which a judge may order Hartford schools to desegregate, an emotionally charged issue for him in the campaign. Rather, he talked about educating each child to the "maximum potential" and insuring that communities and parents have "some say as to where their children go to school."
And while Mr. Rowland spent the months before the November election skewering the economic policies of his predecessor, Governor Lowell P. Weicker Jr., today Mr. Rowland hailed him as a "memorable figure" and urged people to thank him for his 30 years of service to the state.
It was a speech that extended a hand to Democratic legislators, a move perhaps borne out of political necessity -- Mr. Rowland was elected with just 36 percent of the vote. If he is to succeed in his overall plan to shrink the government and phase out the state income tax, he must win the trust of the state's Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. And although some prominent Democrats criticized Mr. Rowland today, others said that the general nature of his speech, identifying shared concerns, was an encouraging step.
"I was pleased that he spoke in generalities," said Thomas D. Ritter, a Democrat and the Speaker of the House. "He was making his best effort to work in a bipartisan fashion. If he had too many specifics, it would have alienated some legislators because we've had no input."
The 20-minute speech to the State Legislature was the highlight of Mr. Rowland's Inauguration Day celebration. After a luncheon given by Governor Weicker and a one-mile parade through downtown Hartford, Mr. Rowland was sworn in by his father, Sherwood, a former city comptroller of Waterbury, on a dais outside the State Capitol. On a sunny but bitterly cold afternoon, roughly 1,200 people gathered to watch him take his oath of office.
With that, Mr. Rowland, of Waterbury, became the state's 86th governor. "It's been a long time coming, and it's hard to believe the day is actually here," he told the crowd.
The moment was the culmination of a five-year quest that began in 1990, when Mr. Rowland lost the governorship to Mr. Weicker, who was running as an independent representing a newly-formed third party. This year, he defeated three major opponents in the general election, a substantial accomplishment in a state where the Democrats outnumber Republicans about 3-to-2.
Many Republicans celebrated today as the end to a long travail: the Democrats' domination of Connecticut state government for much of the last four decades. Thomas J. Meskill, the last Republican governor, left office after one term in 1974.
As Republicans rejoiced, they vowed that this time the change in parties would not be limited to one term. In addition to Mr. Rowland's taking office, the Republicans have taken control of the State Senate for the first time in 12 years.
George L. (Doc) Gunther, a 14-term Republican State Senator, remarked: "This is excellent. It's been 20 long years."
Although Mr. Rowland avoided specifically partisan language in his speech this afternoon, he echoed the script of Republicans in New York, New Jersey and Washington. He vowed to shrink state government, to return more control to localities and individuals and to get tough on crime, expanding the death penalty.
Lamenting the impact that government has had on people, Mr. Rowland remarked: "From a nation of pioneers governed by heroes, we have become a nation of form filers -- taxpayers who work in the midst of poverty and crime for nearly six months of every year just to pay for the very bureaucracies which send us the forms."
Despite Mr. Rowland's effort not to alienate Democrats, their reaction was subdued. Edward L. Marcus, that party's state chairman, called the speech "too general" and asked when Mr. Rowland would "provide more meat on the bones."
But other Democratic legislators commended Mr. Rowland. "It was a good first speech," said State Senator Kevin B. Sullivan. "At this point, I would not dismiss the prospects for a lot of bipartisanship."

HEADLINE: Peso Down; Mexican Stocks Fall

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Uncertain over the Government's plan to overcome Mexico's economic crisis, stock markets in both the United States and Mexico lost ground today as the peso sank further against the dollar.
Earlier in the day, the Mexican market saw some panic selling, sliding almost 6 percent at one point. It recovered after investors learned that the Mexican Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, was scheduled to meet with foreign investors in New York on Thursday morning. 
 Mr. Ortiz will try to explain the recovery plan to as many as 400 investors and analysts who are expected to attend the meeting at the Pierre Hotel. He was on the phone today talking with New York bankers.
The Mexican stock market ended the day at 2,269.87, down 8.26 points, or 0.36 percent. On the New York Stock Exchange, American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico were the most heavily traded issue, closing at $38.125, down 50 cents. Other big Latin American stock markets in Brazil and Argentina were also down, in part due to the Mexican crisis.
In currency trading, the peso was pounded again today, falling more than 5 percent, to 5.575 pesos to the dollar. That means a peso is worth 17.9 cents compared with 28.9 cents before the devaluation on Dec. 20.
Investors said they were generally unimpressed with the economic emergency plan announced on Tuesday by President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. The plan holds down wages and prices and slashes the federal budget to help control inflation and recover from devaluation.
"The most important thing that was missing was any clear idea from the Government of where the currency will settle," said Geoffrey E. J. Dennis, Latin American equity strategist for Bear, Stearns & Company in New York. Foreign investors were also disappointed that Mr. Zedillo did not clearly say how the Government intended to pay for some $7 billion in short-term bonds that are scheduled to mature over the next month. And still other investors said that the Government should have proposed selling some attractive state-run businesses, including parts of the oil and natural-gas monopoly.
The plan includes an $18 billion credit line provided by the United States, Canada and other nations to help Mexico stabilize the peso.
Financial analysts in New York said they hoped that Mr. Ortiz's presentation Thursday would turn out better than the one held in the first week of crisis by the former Finance Minister, Jaime Serra Puche. Mr. Serra addressed about 60 investment bankers and analysts in New York, who were openly skeptical of the Government's ability to control the crisis. He was forced to resign a week later.
The pressure will be on Mr. Ortiz, a former finance under secretary respected by many New York investment officials, to provide important details that were left out of Mr. Zedillo's address.
After Mexico's central bank decided that it could no longer defend the peso from speculators, the Government was forced to let the currency float against the dollar on Dec. 21.
In a break from tradition that one Mexican official said responded to the concerns of foreign investors, the central bank made known the level of its foreign reserves -- $6.148 billion, down from $17 billion on Nov. 1. Until now, the reserves figure was given only two or three times a year.
At the central bank's weekly auction of treasury certificates, interest on the 28-day certificate was 33 percent, up from 31 percent last week.
Mr. Zedillo's stabilization plan sets caps for wage increases and some prices, but is silent on where the Government expects the free-floating peso to settle. However, late tonight, the central bank announced that the peso would be pegged at a target rate of 4.5 to the dollar.
The Government bonds scheduled to mature over the next month, called tesobonos, are paid in pesos but pegged to dollars, meaning that the Government's obligations have soared since the devaluation.
A document from Mr. Zedillo's office says the Government is working with leading investment banks to devise more attractive bonds that can be swapped for the existing bonds when they fall due.
Luis R. Luis, head of research for emerging markets at Scudder, Stevens & Clark, the mutual-fund company in Boston, said that although the Government's plans for the bonds were unclear, there was a positive sign on Tuesday. The Mexican central bank set a rate of 5.5 pesos to the dollar that it would pay the holders of about $670 million worth of bonds this week.
Mr. Luis said it was possible for Mexico to come up with bonds that investors would want, if the terms were right and the risks were reduced. He said that tesobonos were resold on the secondary market at interest rates of 20 to 22 percent. Mr. Luis predicted that new bonds payable in dollars at slightly lower rates would be attractive enough for investors to consider keeping their money in Mexico.
Many investors felt let down by the modest scale of the Government's plan to sell some of the companies it owns. In particular, they had expected to see the petrochemical plants and small natural-gas pipeline network of the state oil monopoly, Pemex, being offered for sale.
However, mention of Pemex was dropped after labor unions had expressed strong opposition to Mr. Zedillo's plan to hold down union wage increases in spite of rising inflation. Analysts said the Government feared that the unions might have rebelled if asked to accept the job losses that would be likely, should part of Pemex be sold.
Some analysts were not convinced that the Government had the power to maintain the 7 percent cap on wages this year, especially if prices started to rise out of control.
"Even though the unions were dragged to the tables at the end and signed the agreement, there's a real concern that wage inflation cannot be held at the level they agreed upon," Mr. Dennis said.
While investors will be pressing Mr. Ortiz for details, they will also push him to clarify aspects of the plan that have been confused. The Finance Ministry today released a statement disavowing responsibility for an English-language version of the stabilization plan, sent to foreign investors, that sets an inflation target for 1995 of 16 percent and states that the corporate income-tax rate will increase to 35 percent.
A ministry spokesman said neither of those figures was part of the actual plan.

Treasuries Gain in Price, Ending a Losing Streak

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday for the first time in five trading sessions but most traders viewed the rise as a technical correction rather than as a precursor to even higher prices.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 22/32 , to 96, for a yield of 7.85 percent, down from 7.92 percent on Tuesday or about where it was last Thursday. A three-month bill fell 9 basis points, to 5.68 percent, and a six-month issue dropped 10 points, to 6.27 percent. 
 One of the factors behind the price gains was a stronger dollar, which makes dollar-denominated investments like bonds more attractive to foreign investors. Also, gold was down sharply, and the Commodity Research Bureau's index of various commodity futures rose only slightly, by 0.46 point, to 235.22
Tony Crescenzi, director of fixed-income trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Company, a New York brokerage firm, said, "Retail buyers are still somewhat reluctant to commit themselves fully to the market, but they're clearly warming up to it."
He said the market's gains were influenced by a drop in the prices of industrial materials, as the very short maturities and very long maturities reversed their previous declines. "The move in industrial materials," Mr. Crescenzi said, "is clearly tangible evidence that the pace of economic activity could be peaking and that a change is in the making. Price gains in industrial materials have been one of the market's biggest headaches."
Yesterday's strong performance put the long bond back into its monthlong trading range. Basically the Federal Reserve has been responsible for the recent bouts of buying, including yesterday's. Its last interest rate increase, on Nov. 15, which was aggressive, changed the market's perception of how well the Fed was doing its job. "It went from following the market to leading the market," Mr. Crescenzi said. "Since the last tightening, the market has been trading well."
Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data in Boston, said: "Bonds headed higher on the back of strong buying from institutional investors. They made their first significant appearance of the new year, buying paper in the two-year to five-year sectors. That left dealers a little short, and eager to cover their positions quickly in the thin market."
The yield on the two-year note dropped 11 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.62 percent, while the yield on a five-year note fell 8 basis points, to 7.80 percent.
Some market watchers expect the economic data this week to give bond prices an additional lift. Traders expect chain-store sales, which are due today, to be soft relative to the early forecast; the employment report due tomorrow could also reflect some adjustment in areas affected by colder weather. These include seasonal declines in some job sectors that were not captured in November because of the early reporting dates.
Today, the Treasury will auction $ 17.25 billion of new one-year bills. Yesterday, the one-year rate was 6.67 percent in late trading.
Elsewhere, municipal bond prices rose for the first time in three days amid investor demand for securities with intermediate maturities.
Some trading desks said that investors were favoring debt securities maturing in 15 to 20 years because their principal was subject to smaller fluctuations than longer maturities, while still offering higher coupons than short maturities.

HEADLINE: Dole Offers Foreign Policy Initiatives

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Bob Dole took up his role as Senate majority leader today with a two-pronged attack on the Administration's foreign policy, introducing legislation to stop observing the arms embargo against Bosnia and to give Congress more control over the scope and financing of United Nations peacekeeping.
The move represented the first foreign policy confrontation between the new Republican majority in Congress and the Administration. And it underscored the intention of the Republican-dominated Congress in general -- and Mr. Dole in particular -- to put the Administration on the defensive and try to wrest control of at least part of the foreign policy agenda from the Democrats. 
 In another sign of things to come, Mr. Dole also pledged that the Senate would question the legality of giving economic aid to North Korea as part of a far-reaching nuclear agreement, and examine closely the cost of helping Haiti.
In recent weeks the Kansas Senator has cast himself as a sort of shadow secretary of state, challenging NATO generals during a visit to Brussels on their inaction on Bosnia and Herzegovina, chastising the Europeans for failing to arm the Bosnian Government and threatening to block the nuclear deal with North Korea in the days before an American pilot was freed.
Under one bill by Mr. Dole, the United States would cease to honor the United Nations arms embargo on Bosnia either at the request of the Bosnian Government or at the end of a four-month cease-fire on May 1.
Mr. Dole's move could not have come as a total surprise to the Administration, because it largely repeated the language of a similar Dole initiative that passed the Senate in August. But it complicates Administration efforts to assure the allies that Washington will not unilaterally allow the sale of arms to the Bosnian Government.
Although the Administration stopped enforcing the embargo, it has opposed violating it on its own, arguing that such a move would set a precedent for other countries to ignore United Nations resolutions and would widen the war.
In denouncing the move, the State Department spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said, "If you take on the unilateral responsibility of lifting the arms embargo, the United States would also unilaterally take on the consequences of that action, and that would include, in our view as a moral responsibility, the arming, training and equipping of the Bosnian Muslims who would have to defend themselves." Another consequence, he said, would be to legitimize Iran's shipment of weapons to the Muslims in Bosnia.
Today's bill confounded the Administration because it would allow the United States to send arms to the Bosnian Government in violation of the United Nations embargo, but would prohibit the United States from sending ground troops to deliver the arms or train the Bosnians in how to use them.
"How that could be achieved without massive use of U.S. force unilaterally, and very, very likely the introduction of U.S. ground troops, is a question that someone I hope will pose to Senator Dole," Mr. McCurry told reporters.
Mr. Dole also proposed a "Post-Cold War Powers Act" that would redesign and restrict the American contribution to the financing of United Nations peacekeeping operations and place strict limits on allowing American troops to serve under United Nations command.
It would require the Administration to identify specific budget sources of financing before it votes to create or extend a peacekeeping mission, and under a complicated formula, would allow the Pentagon to charge the United Nations for much of the equipment and services it now provides for free.
The bill would also set a maximum of 25 percent for the United States share of the total United Nations peacekeeping budget, down from the current share of 31 percent. That goal is shared by the Administration as well.
Mr. Dole's proposal would also eliminate all but two sections of the War Powers Resolution, apparently in an effort to increase the authority of a President to keep combat troops abroad without explicit approval from Congress and to trim the law to its least sensitive provisions.
As the Vietnam War was nearing its end in 1973, Congress enacted the law in an effort to reassert its authority while not compromising a President's need to act quickly. The law requires a President to notify Congress in a timely fashion when American troops are being sent abroad with a strong probability that they will engage in combat. The troops must be withdrawn within 90 days unless Congress explicitly approves their mission.
But the law has proved largely ineffective because of Presidential resistance, and because Congress is usually willing to let the White House assume the political risk of sending troops abroad. In practice, Presidents have consulted with Congress about sending troops abroad but have rejected the part of the law that requires them to bring troops home unless they are given Congressional approval. Mr. Dole's proposal would bring the law into line with that practice.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK'S NEW GOVERNOR: THE OVERVIEW;
PATAKI PROMISES A REDUCED BUDGET AND LOWER TAXES

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Emphasizing his pledge to reduce the size of state government, Gov. George E. Pataki promised today in his first address to the Legislature to propose a budget for the coming year that would spend less than the state will spend this year.
In his 45-minute State of the State address, Mr. Pataki, the first Republican Governor in 20 years, also rededicated himself to cutting state income taxes by 25 percent over four years. And he announced that he would sign an executive order declaring a moratorium on new state regulations, except those needed to protect public health and safety or to promote job creation. 
 "Members of the Legislature, we begin here today by acknowledging a simple fact: The government of New York is too big and it spends too much money," Mr. Pataki said, looking out on an Assembly chamber packed with lawmakers and dignitaries. "Today, and in the foreseeable future, we must and we will cut spending, and then cut it again." [Excerpts, page B6.]
The new Governor, the first chief executive to come directly from the Legislature since 1855, used his speech to reach out to his former colleagues, urging them to join him in building a bipartisan partnership. In contrast to former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who often addressed the legislators caustically, once even referring to them as "monkeys," Mr. Pataki said that lawmaking was "an honorable endeavor." [Analysis, page B7.]
He paid tribute to the leaders of both houses by name, and paid a special welcome to Assemblyman Jay J. Dinga, a freshman Republican from Broome County who was sitting in the brown leather chair that Mr. Pataki occupied during his eight years in the Assembly.
"The difference, I guess, from Mario Cuomo to George Pataki, was clearly that he had a deep respect for the Legislature," said the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who more than anyone else can stand in the way of the Governor's proposals.
But Mr. Pataki also pointedly warned the lawmakers that he would take drastic action if they continued their 10-year tradition of failing to pass a budget by April 1, the start of the fiscal year. Should the legislators fail to pass a budget on time, the Governor said, he would refuse to send them the emergency appropriation bills that would be needed to keep government functioning. "You won't be paid, and neither will I," he said.
Mr. Pataki also reminded the leaders of the Democratic-controlled Assembly that he plans to lobby Democratic lawmakers individually to support his fiscal proposals. In an effort to break Albany's tradition of party-line voting, Mr. Pataki has said that if he cannot forge a consensus with Mr. Silver, he will not hesitate to try to build a majority in that 150-member House by persuading 20 Democrats to join the 56 Republicans. The Senate has a Republican majority that broadly supports Mr. Pataki's initiatives.
In another overture to the Legislature, Mr. Pataki stepped back from his campaign call for term limits on both lawmakers and statewide officials.
"I understand your natural reluctance to pass a constitutional amendment that would impose term limits on the State Legislature, so let's start with me," he said. "Let's enact first passage of a constitutional amendment that would limit the governor, lieutenant governor, comptroller and attorney general to two consecutive terms."
The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican from Rensselaer County who had announced his opposition to term limits only four days ago, said he could live with the new proposal. "I think there's a big distinction because the people can get at us and are closer to us and we to them," he said, referring to the Legislature.
Mr. Silver said he would consider the proposal, but said that in principle, he remains opposed to term limits.
Mr. Pataki's proposal to cut spending below this year's level is an alien notion in a town where spending increased during the 12 years of the Cuomo administration by an average of nearly 7 percent a year. State budget officials said the last Governor to propose a real cut in spending was Thomas E. Dewey in 1943, and the Legislature that year enacted a budget that was smaller than in 1942.
While Mr. Cuomo never proposed a cut in spending, the state ended up spending less in one of his years, 1991, than it had the year before. That is because the recession dried up state revenues, forcing the Governor and Legislature to slash state spending in the middle of the fiscal year in order to balance the budget.
Mr. Pataki's proposal is similar to that made last year by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who did not travel to Albany today to hear Mr. Pataki's speech. The Mayor used the honeymoon of his first year in office to persuade the City Council to enact a budget that cut city spending for the first time in 16 years.
Officials in the Pataki administration and the Legislature said they could not yet estimate how much they would have to cut to eliminate the annual growth that results from inflation and factors like increased school attendance and health care costs. But Mr. Pataki has said that he must find nearly $5 billion in savings to balance next year's budget and to pay for $1 billion in proposed tax cuts. The state's general fund budget this year is $34 billion.
Mr. Pataki has said he will consider an array of spending cuts, including layoffs of state workers, restrictions on Medicaid benefits and the elimination and consolidation of state agencies. He is scheduled to present his budget proposal to the Legislature on Feb. 1.
He offered few details about his plans today, and those he disclosed would save relatively small sums. He said, for instance, that he would propose eliminating the State Energy Office, which has 214 employees and a budget of $17 million, and the Commission on Cable Television, which has 60 employees and a budget of $4.5 million.
He also suggested merging several economic development authorities into one and consolidating several construction financing agencies. But his office could not estimate the savings that would be produced by those moves.
Mr. Pataki did not mention environmental protection or children's issues at any point during the speech. But he repeated his campaign pledges to sign the death penalty into law, to end parole for violent felons, to end work release for dangerous convicts and to enact mandatory sentences for crimes committed with deadly weapons.
He reiterated his support for welfare programs that require able-bodied recipients to work and that cut benefits for parents whose children fail to attend school.
On education policy, he proposed setting a statewide election day for voting for local school board members and approving school budgets, a move intended to increase voter turnout. And he called for abolishing the Board of Regents, a proposal that would require a constitutional amendment and that has little support in the Legislature, which appoints the regents.

HEADLINE: Warning for Brazil in Mexican Crisis

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Jan. 3

 BODY:
After Mexico, what major Latin country has an overvalued currency, a growing appetite for imports and a new president?
Brazil. 
 "Mexico is a warning to Brazilians not to play around with an overvalued exchange rate," said Ernane Galveas, who served as Finance Minister in the early 1980's. "We are frittering away the export surpluses we built up during the 1980's."
Surging imports, a dwindling trade surplus and nervousness over Mexico's rocky peso devaluation could test the financial policies of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was inaugurated on Sunday as Brazil's new President. But some trade experts argue that the similarities are superficial. Brazil is in far better shape, they say, to absorb foreign goods and add that many of the products arriving in the country presage business growth.
Armed with a stronger new currency, the real, and aided by far fewer import restrictions, Brazilians doubled their monthly imports this year. In November, Brazil recorded its first monthly trade deficit since 1987 and its largest since 1980.
The import boom here is evident on supermarket shelves stocked with American products like Smucker's jam, Budweiser beer, Heinz mustard and Wella shampoo.
Flush with the nation's first strong currency in years, so many Brazilians flocked to duty-free border shops in neighboring Paraguay over the Christmas season that the authorities opened a private service road across the world's largest dam, at Itaipu, to relieve the congestion of tour buses. On one Saturday last month, 2,300 Brazilian buses laid siege to Ciudad del Este, a border town.
Over all, Brazil finished 1994 with an $11 billion trade surplus. But economists predict that this surplus will drop by more than half this year. Factoring in Brazil's foreign debt payments and remittances, the nation's current-account deficit -- the difference between what is taken in from exports, plus new net investment, and what is paid for imports and interest on foreign debt -- is expected to climb to $10 billion this year from $1 billion in 1994.
As recently as the early 1990's, Brazil was in the opposite situation. It had the world's third-largest trade surplus, after Japan and Germany.
But some trade experts say Brazil is far less vulnerable to a crisis because, in contrast to Mexico, its economy is both larger and stronger. "Brazil's current-account deficit is less than 2 percent of G.N.P. -- and that is easily financed by external borrowing," said Alden Brewster, a New York partner of Banco Icatu, a Brazilian investment bank.
In Mexico, where the trade deficit ballooned to $30 billion, authorities were forced to devalue the peso, and the new President, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, has imposed austerity measures. Brazil, on the other hand, has sufficient reserves to cover 16 months of imports, which leaves room to maneuver.
Brazil is a huge export market to Americans. According to a recent survey by Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, 77 percent of American international trade executives surveyed cited Brazil as offering the best trade opportunities in Central and South America. This year, Brazil displaced Venezuela as Florida's largest export destination.
"Brazil ranks as one of the highest priorities we have for deepening trade relations with the big emerging markets," Jeffrey E. Garten, United States Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, said by telephone from Washington. "We are determined to develop the commercial ties way beyond what they have been in recent decades."
Mr. Garten is scheduled to visit here in February, and Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown in March. Later this year, the Commerce Department will bring to Brazil American executives from companies in telecommunications, transportation, power generating and environmental technology.
Air cargo traffic from the United States to Brazil has jumped by 50 percent since July 1, when Brazil adopted an anti-inflation effort known as the Real Plan.
With a two-week backlog for air cargo at Miami, Emery Worldwide has started chartering wide-body planes to meet Brazilian demand. In Europe, Lufthansa customers face a one-month wait to ship cargo from Frankfurt to Sao Paulo.
At Sao Paulo's international airport, imported cargo awaiting customs clearance is stacked under tarpaulins or in inflatable warehouses.
To ease the entry of foreign goods, Brazilian authorities plan in April to abolish an import-permit system in place since 1948. Over the last 15 years, the Government has abolished an index of 3,000 imported products that had been barred because they threatened Brazilian industries. It has cut the average import duty to 12 percent from 88 percent. "Until recently, Brazil was as closed as Albania or Tibet," Veja, a weekly magazine, said of Government efforts to reduce nontariff barriers.
The flood of imports last year provoked a dozen investigations by Brazil's Industry and Trade Ministry, which is trying to determine if goods like American cotton, Chinese fans and Korean textiles were sold here at unrealistically low prices. Dozens of Brazilian textile producers have gone bankrupt. Hobbled by a strong currency, many shoe manufacturers are directing production away from exports to the home market.
The blow of increasing imports has been cushioned by the boom in Brazil's broad economy. Industrial growth was 6.4 percent in 1994, one of the highest levels since the early 1970's.
Although auto imports hit 190,000 last year, almost triple the level of 1993, Brazilian car manufacturers muted their complaints because they operated at near capacity, producing a record 1.7 million cars. And domestic toy production was up 18 percent this Christmas, even though foreign toy companies took 10 percent of the Brazilian market.
And though the volume of Christmas sales jumped by 50 percent last month, Brazil's monthly inflation rate dropped to 2 percent in December.
"It's a real mistake to just look at trade figures and say that something has gone wrong," Mr. Garten of the Commerce Department said. "The imports will help in the anti-inflation fight. The capital equipment will help with future growth."
In fact, oil, raw materials and machinery and factory equipment account for 75 percent of Brazil's imports.

Cleaning the environment gets harder, but there are solutions.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
CLEANER is better -- but at what price? Last month, 31 counties in New York and Pennsylvania backed away from a voluntary commitment to reduce smog by burning a more expensive blend of gasoline in privately owned cars. And while small acts of resistance do not make a counterrevolution, the message can be ignored only at environmentalists' peril.
For two decades Washington has been basing policy on the conventional wisdom that Americans will happily pay to make it safe for anyone to drink the water and breathe the air anywhere in the country. But now that the easy cleanup battles have been won -- and politicians without ties to the environmental lobbies dominate Congress -- the assumption is sure to be questioned. 
 And in the view of Paul Portney of Resources for the Future, not a moment too soon: The alternative to a rethinking of the basics, he believes, is a piecemeal rebellion against Big Green. If costs are not weighed against benefits, argues Mr. Portney, the vice president of the Washington-based environmental research group, "we are in danger of losing the whole kit and caboodle."
The reformulated gasoline story is only a straw in the political wind, but an instructive one. As of this week, drivers in nine cities (including New York and Philadelphia) were required to switch to a fuel blend that cuts emissions of toxic chemicals and carbon monoxide as well as the "volatile hydrocarbons" that are precursors to ozone smog. Places with lesser smog problems were given the option of making the switch, too, and many did. But when prices started going up at the pump (by roughly a dime a gallon), three counties in New York and 28 in Pennsylvania petitioned Washington for a reprieve.
This is not a simple tale of the victory of populist common sense over environmental elitism. Counties that opted out of reformulated gasoline will generally have to find some means of reducing emissions. And Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, estimates that the "first phase" gasoline blend mandated for 1995 is more cost-effective than many of the alternatives. But it does suggest that Americans are no longer lining up to pay the bill for any environmental service rendered.
By the same token, notes Tom Lareau, an economist at the American Petroleum Institute, motorists are resisting tougher pollution inspection programs -- especially ones that require testing in one place and repair in another. And the politics of ozone containment are likely to get a lot rougher, as states require auto companies to sell expensive, inconvenient electric vehicles.
How might Congress defuse the backlash without rolling back a generation of achievement?
REQUIRE COST ANALYSIS. Five major environmental acts, including those setting standards for air, water and toxic waste, actually prohibit regulators from weighing costs against benefits -- the legacy, notes Robert Stavins, an economist at Harvard, of Democrats' suspicion that Republicans would sabotage environmental regulation.
Mr. Portney argues that the new crowd could (and should) undo those prohibitions, allowing agencies to consider cost in setting regulations. "It's the big enchilada of environmental reform," Mr. Portney says, one giving regulators the flexibility to bend without breaking.
PERMIT VARIABLE STANDARDS. Under Federal law, New York must someday be as clean as Boise. But these uniform standards are "a fiction," Mr. Hahn argues: when the crunch comes, onerous requirements are postponed.
That informal process breeds cynicism, however, and creates enormous headaches for businesses that must plan pollution-control investments years in advance. Mr. Hahn would permit "local solutions to local problems," giving, say, Southern California the option of setting a lower standard for ozone. This may mean that the small minority most seriously at risk would be forced to live elsewhere. But loss of the entitlement might be worth the social price -- especially since few believe the entitlement will ever be honored.
James Krier of the University of Michigan Law School offers a variation on the theme, redefining "uniform" to apply to antipollution effort rather than result. Los Angeles, for example, might be required only to spend as much per resident on cleanup regulation as the national average.
EXPLOIT MARKET INCENTIVES. Every environmental regulator now talks the talk of free markets, but relatively few walk the walk. In the case of ozone, for example, state regulators have ignored the option of letting polluters pay others to reduce emissions. And that failure, Mr. Hahn estimates, could raise the cost of compliance in the Northeast by tens of billions of dollars a year.
Congress might require regulators to consider market solutions to antipollution mandates, the way the law now requires localities to estimate the environmental impact of new highways. It wouldn't assure least-cost results, but it would give markets a chance to solve problems that government cannot solve efficiently.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Prices Decline Sharply On Interest Rate Concerns

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Gold prices fell to their lowest levels in eight months yesterday on expectations that the Federal Reserve would soon push up interest rates to keep inflation in check.
Other precious metals followed, extending the steep losses posted on Tuesday. Gold and other precious metals are seen as hedges against inflation. 
 Still, the Commodity Research Bureau's index rose 0.46 point, to 235.22, pulled up in part by sharp rises in cotton, cocoa and sugar futures.
Gold has fallen nearly 6 percent from its 12-month high in October, including a drop of 2 percent in the last two days.
Yesterday, gold for February delivery fell $5.60 an ounce, to $375.30, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, the lowest price for an active near-term futures contract since May 5.
Also on the Commodity Exchange, March silver tumbled 12.7 cents an ounce, to $4.635. April platinum fell $10.10 an ounce, to $405.70, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Many traders expect the Federal Reserve to increase short-term interest rates at its policy-making meeting at the end of the month to dampen inflationary pressures. Such a move would reduce investment demand for precious metals and could also slow industrial demand for metals.
"Investor psychology is that they believe monetary authorities are intent on restraining inflation," a commodities analyst for Paine Webber Inc. in New York, Bernard Savaiko, said. "There's really little incentive to hold metals in this climate."
David Rinehimer of Smith Barney Inc. said precious metals usually declined in the first quarter, following the Christmas spike in jewelry demand. But he said the magnitude of this week's drop was unusual.
On other commodity markets, cotton futures rose in anticipations of increased demand from Pakistan and India. March cotton gained 1.77 cents, to 90.12 cents a pound, on the New York Cotton Exchange.

HEADLINE: French Brace For Violence From Algeria

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Bracing for new reprisals for the deaths of four Algerian militants who hijacked a French airliner to Marseilles late last month, France has stepped up surveillance of Islamic groups in France and canceled Air France flights to and from Algeria.
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said today that France would also send a team of experts to Algeria to improve security for the dwindling community of French oil workers, business executives, missionaries and diplomats still living in the convulsed former French colony. 
 He acknowledged that there are conflicting reports whether Islamic militants planned to carry their war against Algeria's military Government onto French soil, but he noted, "On French territory, the Government is determined -- we will not let terrorism rot our society."
The Armed Islamic Group, which took credit for the hijacking, has until now focused on driving foreigners out of Algeria. In the last 16 months, it has killed 80 foreigners, including four Catholic priests last week to avenge the killing of the hijackers by French commandos.
The United States, France, Britain, Germany and several other Western governments have received letters at their embassies in Bern, Switzerland, supposedly signed by the Armed Islamic Group, setting a Jan. 7 deadline to close their embassies in Algiers. After that, it said, "all infidels will be killed in cold blood."
In Washington, the State Department confirmed that the American Embassy had received such a letter but could not vouch for its authenticity. "But obviously," said the spokesman, Michael McCurry, "we take threats like that seriously." He added that security in Alergia had been a concern for some time and that the embassy staff there had been reduced "to a level that we consider appropriate."
A different group, the Islamic Salvation Army, reportedly declared war on France in a statement last weekend. Later, it denied mentioning "taking the war to France," but claimed the right to do so.
France endorsed the Algerian Government's decision in December 1991 to cancel a second round of parliamentary elections that seemed likely to bring the broad-based Islamic Salvation Front to power. Since then, France has provided the Algerian Government with weapons, helicopters and extensive economic aid.
. Reports from Algiers today said Algeria's former governing party, the National Liberation Front, had held talks with two leaders from the front, Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, who are currently under house arrest. A spokesman for the front, Brahim Younessi, told a French daily Tuesday that the front had no interest in spreading the conflict to France or anywhere else in Europe. But with memories still fresh of a bombing campaign carried out by pro-Iranian Islamic groups in Paris in 1986, France is taking no chances, tightening security along its borders and renewing appeals for Britain and Germany to clamp down on Islamic militants on their soil.
French assertions that militants are using Britain as a base were reinforced last weekend when The Sunday Times of London reported that Britain's internal security service, M.I.5, believed the Armed Islamic Group was using mosques in Britain to raise money to buy weapons for its war in Algeria.
The report also said M.I.5 had identified 20 "hard-core activists," some of whom had traveled to Algeria to carry out killings before returning to London. Last weekend, French newspapers reported that three Islamic militants had arrived from Britain by ferry and were being urgently sought by the French police.
The French police, who last year carried out several raids on Islamic militant hideouts in France and subsequently deported 25 alleged militants, are reportedly convinced that strong ties still exist between the Algerian rebels and the 800,000 Algerians in France.
Last week, the French Justice Ministry ordered an investigating magistrate to establish whether the hijackers of the Air France airliner last month had any accomplices in France.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Liberation, a crew member of the hijacked plane, identified only as Claude, gave the first detailed account of the 54-hour hijacking that ended when French commandos freed the 159 passengers and 12 crew members who were still on board. French Government officials later said the militants planned to blow up the aircraft over Paris.
She said two hostages were killed without warning. The third victim, a young French embassy employee, was killed when the Algerian authorities refused to allow the plane to leave for France.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Reach a Six-Year High

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Despite repeated interest rate increases last year, automobile makers today reported substantial sales gains for both cars and trucks.
The final industry figures will not be available until Thursday, but analysts said the results from the Chrysler Corporation and most Japanese auto makers indicated that the industry achieved its best sales performance in six years. 
 "It's the best total light-vehicle sales year since 1988, when they sold 15.4 million vehicles," said Michael Luckey of the Luckey Consulting Group.
When all the figures are in, he said, the industry's total should be 15 million to 15.1 million vehicles, up from 13.9 million in 1993. The General Motors Corporation's report was delayed by data gathering problems, and the Ford Motor Company elected to wait until Thursday to disclose its figures.
Chrysler, the nation's No. 3 auto maker, said it sold 2.2 million cars and trucks in 1994, up 8 percent from 1993. Once again, sales of pickup trucks, mini-vans and Jeeps led the way, rising 15 percent in 1994, while sales of passenger cars slipped 3 percent.
Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, Robert J. Eaton, speaking to reporters at the North American International Auto Show here, said 1994 marked the most profitable year in the company's 69-year history. The company said on Tuesday that it generated enough cash last year to wipe out its pension debt and pay hourly workers bonuses averaging almost $7,500 each.
"We won't have final financial numbers for about two weeks, but if you can add, you know it will be a record year," Mr. Eaton said.
Through the first nine months of 1994, Chrysler earned $2.5 billion, surpassing the previous full-year profit of $2.4 billion, set in 1984.
Industry analysts estimate that the company's 1994 profits will be $3.6 billion, in contrast to a loss of $2.55 billion in 1993, when the company had a one-time accounting charge of $5 billion.
Many auto executives and analysts predict that sales of new cars and trucks could reach a new record this year or next, as consumer confidence is pushed up by the economic recovery.
"Consumer confidence is excellent right now," said John G. Middlebrook, general manager of G.M.'s Pontiac division. "Obviously a continued racheting up of interest rates is going to slow our business, but with the capacity situation we're in now, slow growth is what we want, and I think it takes some of those interest rates to assure that."
Ford's chairman, Alexander J. Trotman, speaking with reporters at the auto show on Tuesday, said, "It's in the cards" that it could be a record in 1995 and 1996.
United States auto sales peaked at 16.3 million vehicles in 1986, the last year the Federal Government allowed consumers to take an income tax deduction for interest payments on auto loans.
"I think this year we broke the record for breaking records," Chrysler's executive vice president for sales and marketing, Theodor R. Cunningham, said. "It was our best year ever for mini-vans -- despite growing competition -- best year ever for Dodge Truck, best year ever for Jeep and for the Jeep-Eagle Division, and the list goes on."
Mr. Eaton of Chrysler said the record 1994 profits enabled the auto maker to fully finance its pension plan for the first time since 1957 and pay bonuses averaging nearly two months' salary to each employee.
Last year Chrysler paid more than $279.5 million in bonuses, with the average check coming to $4,300, the largest bonus in the history of the United States auto industry.
Among the big Japanese auto makers, the Nissan Motor Company reported the biggest yearly increase, with total car and truck sales rising 12.6 percent in 1994. The Honda Motor Company was next, with gains of 10 percent, while Japan's largest auto maker, the Toyota Motor Corporation, posted an increase of 5.3 percent last year.
Honda said it sold 367,615 Accord models in the United States last year. That makes it virtually certain that Ford's Taurus sedan, which has been America's best-selling car since 1992, will retain the title for 1994. Through November, Ford had sold 354,839 Taurus models, meaning it needed to sell only about 13,000 cars in December to win the annual sales race. Ford usually sells about 32,000 Taurus cars a month.

HEADLINE: Peace Program Is in Danger, Salvadorans Tell the U.N.'s Chief

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 4

 BODY:
El Salvador's program of reconstruction and reconciliation is short $137 million and in danger of losing momentum in its critical last phase, the country's Vice President and leading members of the former rebel army told Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali today.
"Peace is not enough," the Vice President, Enrique Borgo Bustamante, said Tuesday. "We need social peace. We need to remake whatever was Salvador. We need to walk that last part of the road, and we feel so short of breath." 
 He spoke in a joint interview with Salvador Sanchez Ceren, secretary general of the former rebel group, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. The front is now a political party in opposition, but is split by internal differences.
The United Nations has been formally involved since 1991 in a comprehensive plan to restore peace and rebuild an economy destroyed by a 12-year civil war.
Two years ago this month, the Secretary General presided over the signing of a peace treaty in Mexico City, followed by the establishment of a recovery fund of more than $1.5 billion. Two-thirds of this was pledged by the Salvadoran Government and the rest raised by assessment of United Nations members.
Government officials say they cannot provide any more money without levying new taxes or cutting into social programs like education and health.
United Nations peacekeeping officials hold up the Salvadoran accord as one of the organization's post-cold-war success stories. The accord covers a wide range of activities, from human rights accounting to restructuring the military and redistributing land.
The Bush Administration, which played a leading part in bringing the Salvadoran Government to the negotiating table, encouraged the United Nations to take the lead in the peace effort. United Nations involvement would end on April 30 of this year, a final extension of a Security Council mandate that was to expire on Nov. 30, 1994.
Both Vice President Borgo and Mr. Sanchez said that the process of disarming the national police and creating a new integrated force had perhaps done the most to rebuild the confidence of Salvadorans on both sides of the conflict.
Under an international team of advisers, the formation of the new National Civil Police was completed at the end of last month, ahead of schedule. The police officers are being trained in a two-year-old professional National Public Security Academy.
"The political parties have also agreed on a new Supreme Court," Mr. Borgo said. "They are trying to evaluate all the judges and get rid of those not doing their work. The 15 members were elected by the Congress, representing all the political parties in Salvador."
Both sides are concerned that impatience and the appearance of foot-dragging could lead the country into a renewed crisis.
A large number of former rebels, their supporters, government soldiers and others displaced by war have still not been resettled. Of the 41,000 people for whom land had to be found, 15,000 are still without new homes. Others complain that the land they have been given is unproductive or otherwise unsuitable.
In October, when Mr. Boutros-Ghali asked that the mandate of the United Nations mission be extended, he listed other tasks still to be completed. These included the carrying out of recommendations by the commission set up to look into human rights crimes committed during the war years.

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: THE PRESIDENT;
Far From Capitol's Din, A Hero at Clinton School

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Jan. 4

 BODY:
The library is named for his wife. The recreation room is named for his mother. But the whole shebang is named for him, and if President Clinton was not the tallest timber in Washington today, he was a proud bastion of beige concrete block and shiny new linoleum at the William Jefferson Clinton Elementary Magnet School.
As the new Newtonian era dawned in Washington, Mr. Clinton was out among the people who helped him get there in the first place as he dedicated the school in the suburban community of Sherwood this morning. In doing so, he once again styled himself as the determined outsider intent on grappling with the nation's problems, even in the face of a Republican Congress abuzz with big, bold notions. 
 "I'm going back to challenge the Congress to do what is necessary to guarantee the future of the next generation of Americans," Mr. Clinton told an ebullient audience of more than 600 students, teachers and local officials in the school's "cafetorium."
"Anybody can come up and say, 'I want to give you a tax cut,' and make people happy in the short run," he said. "What I want to do is reduce taxes for people to invest in the education of their children and their own training and skills, so we can go forward and grow this economy."
Mr. Clinton worked as Governor of Arkansas to improve education, and he used the dedication ceremony to paint his Presidency as a continuation of such efforts, and to make a renewed pitch for his proposed "Middle Class Bill of Rights" of tax deductions for college and technical education. He also suggested that reports of his political demise were greatly exaggerated.
"You know, I was apprehensive when I heard that you were going to name this school after me," said the President, who was winding up a 48-hour vacation here. "Most people don't have a school named after them until they're not around anymore. And here I am, apparently healthy and able to enjoy it."
Incumbent Presidents from Harry S. Truman to Ronald Reagan have fled the White House for Main Street when their administrations were becalmed or floundering. Mr. Reagan went around the country for months in the summer of 1987 touting his "Economic Bill of Rights" of Republican free-market ideas to help repair the damage of the Iran-contra affair and stabilize himself for new ventures in foreign diplomacy.
"It sounds like the President's returning to the campaign mode that was successful for him in the past," Marlin Fitzwater, who was press secretary for Mr. Reagan and George Bush, said in a telephone interview. "It is what he does best, the town meeting, the moving around the country, the talking with groups informally. A lot of people would say he's never done as well since he was inaugurated as he did in the campaign."
White House aides dismiss suggestions that they are gearing up for the 1996 campaign, but also acknowledge that the President intends to get out into the country, where he can still be an automatic star in local news media markets, instead of an "also said" on the national stage.
Next Tuesday, he is likely to visit Galesburg, Ill., the birthplace of the poet Carl Sandburg, to press his proposed tax breaks, including a credit of up to $500 per child for families with adjusted gross incomes of up to $75,000 a year. He may also stop in Cleveland, Atlanta and California in the next two weeks.
"He did something today that was very important to him personally," said Ginny Terzano, the deputy White House press secretary traveling with him. "As Governor, he made a lot of progress to improve education, not only at the state but at the national level. In his remarks today, he made really clear that we have a lot to do, and whether you say that in Arkansas or Washington, the message is clear."
The tone of the day was set by the school choir's rendition of the state song, whose final chorus is: "Oh, I may wander, but when I do, I will never be far from you. You're in my blood and you'll always be. Arkansas, you run deep in me."
As the First Lady of Arkansas, Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary, helped foster the creation of interracial magnet schools like Clinton Elementary, which is intended to draw diverse students by offering special programs. Its library is the "Hillary Rodham Clinton Media Center," and another room, the "Virginia Kelley Multi-Purpose Center," is named for the President's mother, who died a year ago. Down the hall is the "Clinton Room," a glassed-in cubicle with a display of campaign and personal artifacts, including a scrap of pink-rose wallpaper from his boyhood home in Hope.
Before the dedication, the Clintons met with student representatives in the library, one of whom asked the President how he coped with criticism. He answered with Benjamin Franklin's maxim, "Our critics are our friends, for they show us our faults."
"But it's important not to take criticism personally," he said. "That is, a lot of times people try to hurt you personally, and you can't let that happen. So if someone criticizes you, ask yourself, 'Is it true what they're saying?' And if it's true, then say, 'Well, I'm going to try to improve, I'm going to try to do better."'

HEADLINE: NEW YORK'S NEW GOVERNOR;
'A New Era': Excerpts From the State of the State

 BODY:
Following are excepts from Gov. George E. Pataki's State of the State message yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The agenda of reform and renewal that I will put forward is specific and extensive. It sets out clear priorities but let me also say it's not meant as a list of everything that we will try to accomplish together in 1995. I know there is much to do; that each and every lawmaker here has ideas worthy of attention by this Legislature and by this administration. 
 This is a new era, a new beginning in which bipartisanship and participation together can make a difference in the future of New York State.
Today, I want you to know that our administration looks forward to working closely with the Legislature, that I consider bipartisanship a two-way street.
And I especially want you to know that -- because, for me, friends always stay friends -- the door to this Governor's office is always open to each and every one of you.
But we also have to point out that under our democratic system our first duty must be to keep faith with the people of this state.
Assembly Speaker Shelly Silver, you have a proven record of putting principle ahead of politics. Shelly, you're a good leader and a good friend, and I look forward to working with you to meet together the challenges we must face.
And Joe Bruno, my good friend and the new Senate majority leader, Joe, you've been the source of wise counsel to me often in the past. Just as I've sought your help then, I'm sure I will rely on you time and again in the future. Thank you, Joe.
In recent elections, the people have shown themselves not only willing to make change, but to go right on making changes until those of us elected to office get it right.
What I said a few days ago I repeat today: the people have called for smaller, more effective, more efficient government. We must not fail to give them the change they seek. Let us get it right.
The agenda I am putting before you today is one that seeks change that is immediate and real, sweeping and fundamental, the kind of change the people have demanded of us. The people are waiting and watching. They have demanded change. They expect action. Starting here, starting today, we must give them both.
The challenges we face are great, the budget deficit is approaching $5 billion -- a deficit the magnitude of which we did not learn until only a few short days ago.
Now, as many of you know here, I've long been one who's argued for realism and openness in the budget process and I'll admit that in one sense I was finally glad to see that we got the facts. But while I appreciate the candor about the size of the deficit, I've got to tell you I also feel a little bit like John Jacob Astor, a passenger on the Titanic who remarked shortly after the iceberg struck: "I asked for ice, but this is ridiculous."
Surely, the size of this deficit is a crisis, a crisis as I've stated before not of the people's making but of government's, and what government has done, government can undo.

 	 	 		. . .	 	From the time I present the Executive Budget message on [Feb. 1] to the start of the new fiscal year on April 1st, we have two brief months to complete our work. Meeting the April budget deadline is essential.
That's why today I am asking you to approve budget bills by early March, to have full and public debate in the light of day as we move toward the April 1st deadline.
On this first point let me be clear: The practice of back-room budget making must end.
And when I talk about opening the budget process I mean not just to the press and the public, I mean opening it up to all lawmakers, to Rapp Rappleyea and the Assembly Republicans; to Marty Connor and the Senate Democrats. I know from personal experience what it was like. The quality of your ideas is not dependent on whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, whether you are a member of the majority or minority party. The people elected every legislator to speak for them here in Albany.
I believe an open budget process can help us meet the budget deadline and we must be on time. I want to put everyone in this great legislative hall on notice here and now: If the April 1st deadline is not met I will not initiate, nor will I approve legislation to provide interim appropriations for any state function except those that directly affect the health and safety of New Yorkers.
And that means that if we don't have the budget done on time there will be no emergency appropriations to pay the executive or the Legislature -- you won't be paid and neither will I.
The people are asked to take more responsibility for their actions; we must take more responsibility for our own. We must enact the budget on time.
Controller Carl McCall has publicly stated his views about the importance of an on-time budget and his belief that we must end the practice and abuse of temporary appropriations. I look forward to his support on this important issue.
By cutting spending and taxes we will create a smaller, more effective, more efficient government which will allow us to create a climate where individuals can excel and businesses can prosper. To protect personal freedom government must stop unnecessarily burdening individuals and families with massive taxes which stifle initiative, creativity and job production.
These dollars do not belong to the government. These dollars belong to the individuals who earned them. We will not so much be cutting taxes as protecting the people's right to keep the fruits of their own labors.
And as the first step towards the economic renewal of New York we must finally keep the income tax cut promise the Legislature made in 1987. Let me make another point very clear: I will veto any legislation that continues to break that tax cut promise by further delay.

 	 	 		. . .	 	And I don't think you're going to like this one a whole lot, but let me keep going.
As we empower the citizens of New York State, we must also encourage change by taking the first steps towards term limits for state officials. I expected the reaction I'm getting from most of you out here. Term limits will help create a government filled with new ideas and fresh perspectives. The time for term limits is at hand.
Now, I understand your natural reluctance to pass a constitutional amendment that would impose term limits on the State Legislature, so let's start with me. Let's enact first passage of a constitutional amendment that would limit the governor, lieutenant governor, comptroller and attorney general to two consecutive terms.
We got a few converts on that one.
It's worked in 29 other states; it can work here in New York.
I remember the day, 10 years ago, it was my first day as a member of this Assembly and I came up here with my wife, Libby, and -- Libby, I know you're somewhere in the back there and I just want to thank you and if you could just rise, for all you've done for me and for the people of this state. Now I'll be able to go home.
Ten years ago, when Libby and I did come up here, it was my first day as a member of the Assembly. And I sat here and I listened to the Governor deliver his State of the State message at that time. I sat in the seat back there where freshman Assemblyman Jay Dinga is sitting now. I felt privileged then and I feel privileged now to be a part of this great institution.
Today, let me say to Assemblyman Dinga and to all the new members of the Assembly and the Senate, the energy and the enthusiasm you feel today can and will only grow as you accept and meet the challenges of solving the problems of our state.
As my friends, those of you veterans in the Legislature -- Republicans and Democrats -- who have served with me know, you freshmen will come to share with us the deep respect for the job of lawmaker.
It is within this Legislature that the twin spirits of America's civic life -- freedom and responsibility -- live and prosper. A free people choose representatives to serve them in free and open elections. Grant those representatives the responsibility to serve the people's interests faithfully and to the best of their ability.
Every day, lawmakers here in Albany and across our nation work to reaffirm the faith of our founders. Within the democratic institutions of our nation and our state, legislators work day in and day out to fulfill the important responsibility of serving the public interest.
It is demanding, often gritty work. It is fiercely competitive among diverse interests. As our laws are made complex and conflicting elements are hammered into a new form through debate and negotiation.
It is an honorable endeavor.
The Legislature is a marketplace of ideas. It is a forum in which to achieve a fair balance among competing interests in the process of determining the public interest.
As public servants, we have a solemn duty to protect and to preserve personal freedom and restore individual responsibility, to create a more efficient, more effective government, a government that is smaller in size yet meets the essential needs of its people.
Working together, you and I can and must encourage individuals and families to build their futures here with a government that allows them the freedom to achieve, a government that gives them the opportunity to create jobs, a government that fosters tolerance, decency and hope.
It is a great challenge. It is a challenge we must meet. And together, as we meet this challenge, we will restore New York to the greatness that is its destiny.
Thank you and God bless you.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Governor Rowland's State of the State Address

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Gov. John G. Rowland's State of the State address to the General Assembly.
Today is the moment to remake Connecticut as we rapidly approach the 21st century. Our challenge is to provide the hope and the opportunity, especially to our young people, so they will choose to make Connecticut their permanent home once again. 
 As a memorable figure in that legacy, let us together thank Governor Weicker for his distinguished service to Connecticut over more than three decades as a selectman, state legislator, U.S. Congressman, Senator and Governor. He has served us with distinction. . . .
For each generation of Connecticut, there are dreams and challenges. But lasting dreams don't come from a governor or even from a government. Real dreams spring from the hearts of individuals. They exist the first time a child sees his mother, and tries to make sense of the new world. Or when a father holds his child and looks at that miracle with wonder. . . .
In the upcoming budget address, I will discuss specific proposals that will serve to lead our state out of the stagnant status quo. But today, it's time to speak of the philosophy that animates this new administration. . . .
These are the goals of the Rowland-Rell administration: to see all our children educated to each child's maximum potential; to insure that our communities have more local control and parents can have some say as to where their children should go to school; to help our young, our elderly, our ill and our afflicted, when they need help and have no other resources; to make common cause with our neighbors, in that barn-raising spirit of our ancestors.
It's about a shared sense of decency that gives families on welfare an opportunity to make better lives for their children so that all of their neighbors and their children can live in dignity and with hope. It's about protecting the environment, both physical and economic, in a balanced fashion, so that parents have jobs and leave to their children a legacy of an even more beautiful Connecticut.
And it's about removing from our midst the predators who make our streets unsafe. The social compact of Connecticut is about an abiding sense of hope and security -- personal security, a feeling that it's once again safe to walk on our streets and through our neighborhoods. . . .
The State of Connecticut will not tolerate those who break the social compact. Those who break the social compact by hate crime or by street crime will be punished. Period. . . .
For every citizen of our state who's able to work, Connecticut is committed to fostering a climate where good jobs are always available. Real welfare reform will serve to enrich all individuals, but assistance does not mean treating adults as wards of the state. . . .
Connecticut cannot be a place where generations live and die on welfare, where a hand that was originally intended to help instead stifles and destroys the future. . . .
Unfortunately, we've become a state and a nation where individual dreams and initiatives are too often dislodged by government. From a nation of pioneers governed by heroes, we have become a nation of form filers, taxpayers who work in the midst of poverty and crime for nearly six months of every year just to pay for the very bureaucracies which send us the forms.
The state budget will be far leaner. We will help to provide services, but we'll do it smarter, we'll do it better, and we'll do it more economically. This administration will propose and vigorously pursue phasing out the income tax so that Connecticut's economy can again flourish. . . .
The team that seizes this time extends beyond those who take the oath of office today. It is more than the partisans of one party or another. . . .
It is a team that realizes that the bitter rancor of hard-fought elections is past. It is a team that realizes that everything which divides our state is a fraction of that which unites us. And it's a team that consists of all who wish to join us. . . .
One of Connecticut's greatest philosophers, who once lived here in Hartford, in a speech almost a century ago, Mark Twain, admonished young people: "Always do right," he said. "You will gratify some people and astonish the rest."
My friends, may we astonish the people of Connecticut with the quality of government in years to come.

HEADLINE: Stocks of Auto Makers Help to Lift Market

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
A brightening outlook for the automobile industry helped lift stock prices modestly yesterday in unusually heavy trading.
Long-term interest rates also eased in the bond market, the dollar strengthened, and gold fell to its lowest level in eight months. All are signs that gave the financial markets, at least for a day, reasons to be less concerned about inflation. 
 Whether the markets will continue in that consensus as the Jan. 31 policy-making meeting of the Federal Reserve approaches is an open question. The strength of the economy in the fourth quarter, the investment debacle by Orange County, Calif., and the Mexican economic difficulties could influence the deliberations since a rise in interest rates would slow the economy and increase the pain for Orange County and Mexico.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.17 points, to 3,857.65, primarily because of the performance by five stocks, including that of the General Motors Corporation. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 1.60 points, to 460.71, and the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 2.26 points, to 745.84.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal, with 319.5 million shares changing hands, about 10 percent more than the 1994 daily average of 290 million shares. It was the first time in seven sessions that trading was above average. Advancing stocks outpaced decliners by 1,414 to 949.
The rally in auto stocks was prompted by the Chrysler Corporation's announcement of strong monthly sales for cars and light trucks, with the best December in six years. The Ford Motor Corporation and General Motors are scheduled to release their figures today. Chrysler rose 1 7/8, to 50 7/8; G.M. rose 1 1/2, to 43 1/4, and Ford rose 3/4, to 28 5/8.
It is too early for the market to decide whether the Fed is finished raising interest rates. Some analysts believe that the move to auto stocks, considered a sector that does well in the early months of an expansion, could mean some traders believe the economy will be slowed but not choked by the Fed's previous rate increases.
Yet oil and energy stocks are thought to near their peak at the end of an economic cycle and a growing number of investment strategists have been recommending energy stocks.
Oil stocks also did well yesterday, with all companies in S.& P.'s oil group rising. The Mobil Corporation rose 1, to 85 1/8, close to the company's Oct. 31 peak of 87 1/8.
Shares of the Progress Software Corporation, a software developer, rose 2 3/4, to 40 1/8, after it said it planned to announce a new corporate strategy on Monday. Shares of the Dell Computer Corporation rose 2 3/8, to 42 1/4, after it said it had converted a line of computers to use the Intel Corporation's corrected Pentium chip.
Medex, a supplier of disposable hospital products, fell 3 3/8, to 10 3/8, after it said it anticipated lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. Recovery Engineering, a maker of water-purification equipment, fell 3, to 14 1/2, after it also said it expected quarterly earnings to be lower than analysts' estimates.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Non-Token Appointees Mark Women's Advance

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
THE names were threaded through Gov. George E. Pataki's State of the State Message yesterday, the women in his government. He just mentioned their names and titles, said no more, but the message was not lost on his listeners, especially his Democratic listeners. "Look at all those women," a Democratic stalwart, who shall remain nameless at her request, fairly screeched into the telephone. "In real jobs. Look at that. Do you believe it?"
Mr. Pataki has indeed appointed a lot of women to prominent positions in his new administration -- most of them substantial jobs, not token ones or "women's" jobs. The budget director is a woman. The Health Commissioner is a woman. So is the Parks Commissioner, the communications director and the Social Services Commissioner. And of course Mr. Pataki's running mate, Elizabeth P. McCaughey, is now the Lieutenant Governor and designated Medicaid expert. 
 That is, by any measure, a large number of women, even slightly more than Gov. Mario M. Cuomo named to substantial jobs in his government at any one time. Maybe this should not come as a surprise. Mr. Pataki may be a committed feminist. It would have been hard to know that, though, because his campaign was so controlled that New Yorkers learned his views on few issues, except tax cutting and government shrinking.
It is a bit counterintuitive because the Democratic Party takes a rather proprietary interest in the women's movement, while Republicans sometimes sound hostile, letting their talk-show champions use words like "femi-Nazis" with impunity and suggesting that feminism and "family values" are warring concepts.
OF course, many Republicans favor the advancement of women; it was Ronald Reagan who named the first woman to the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor. But Democrats did take the lead in advancing opportunities for women, and here comes Mr. Pataki with his many appointments, and he is not the only one. It is as if the Democrats not only had Congress and a few statehouses taken away from them, but the potent issue of feminism, too. What happened?
Mr. Pataki's communications director, Zenia Mucha, did not respond to requests to discuss her boss's appointment philosophy. Ms. McCaughey, the Lieutenant Governor, says that, "As a very smart leader, George wants the best possible people working with him." Politics did not motivate him, she suggested.
Others guess otherwise.
"Part of it is a very strategic decision to give visibility to women that may pay off at the polls," said Harriett Woods, president of the National Women's Political Caucus. "That's fine with me. Great. I don't care. Whatever works. I guess what I'm saying is, in some strange way, it's sort of like Nixon opening up China. The Republicans may be more aggressive about bringing women in because that's not a constituency they've had, while Democrats have taken it for granted."
Another issue is timing. "Some of what we're seeing is generational," suggested Susan Estrich, a professor of law and political science at the University of Southern California, who ran Michael Dukakis's presidential campaign. "George Pataki is 49. He went to college with smart women, he's grown up around smart women, he's used to being around smart women."
AND there are more competent women in jobs outside the home. As Mr. Pataki is about to learn on other matters, change tends to be incremental in government, not revolutionary. The women's movement has been around for a generation, and at the same time, the economy pushed many women, feminists and nonfeminists, into jobs outside the home. Some have succeeded in government jobs, in Democratic and Republican administrations.
In other words, the most fundamental objective of the women's movement -- opening up opportunities to women -- must be working. Otherwise, how could Mr. Pataki, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and Gov. John M. Engler of Michigan, among others, find accomplished women to appoint?
"It proves how mainstream we've been all along in advocating that competent women should share the policy making in appointive as well as elective office," said Ms. Woods. "That is clearly not a very radical position when Republicans of all stripes are appointing women. It's a validation that there should be a level playing field."
It is also validation that politics works. "Nobody in politics is unaware that women vote, vote in very large numbers, and sometimes vote somewhat differently from men," said Ruth B. Mandel, longtime director of the Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University. "Politically it has become a matter of good practice and politics to include women in an administration."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
To build a young image, the Colombian coffee federation tries a campaign with bolder flavor.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
BEER, liquor and soft drinks are not, it turns out, the only beverages trying to establish more youthful images among consumers in their 20's and 30's. So, too, is coffee, through the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia, the world's largest individual coffee exporter.
The federation's purpose is to convince coffee drinkers that the estimated 1.85 billion pounds of arabica beans it exports annually, which are about 5 cents a pound more expensive than alternatives from other nations, are better tasting and therefore worth their premium price. And now it is also trying to create a revitalized, more contemporary image for its product. 
 The federation and DDB Needham Worldwide Marketing in New York, its longtime agency, could have embraced tactics that pandered to the intended audience. For instance, there might have been a Juan Valdez Jr., the goateed slacker son of the character who serves to symbolize Colombian beans in coffee advertising and on coffee packaging.
Instead, they are introducing a humorous campaign with a hipper, edgier attitude -- old coffee in new cups, if you will. The approach is telegraphed by the exuberant, exhortive theme: "Grab life by the beans." The television commercials and print advertisements, with an initial budget estimated at $4 million to $5 million, are meant to complement the long-running mainstream Valdez campaign, which continues to run separately.
"We're planning to have a lot of fun with that line and hope to make it stick as a concept," said Peter le Comte, president at DDB Needham Worldwide Marketing, an agency within the DDB Needham Worldwide agency in New York.
In addition to the campaign, he added, there will be promotional items emblazoned with the theme: T-shirts, posters, baseball caps and, needless to say, coffee mugs.
The goal is for the assertive "Grab life" line to supplement the Valdez character, who still "enjoys fabulous recognition and very positive image associations" after 35 years, Mr. le Comte said.
"But we thought maybe we ought to do something a little more jazzy, to capture the attention of younger audiences, than the same stuff their parents watched," he added. The target market is consumers ages 18 or 21 to 34 -- "before their midlife crises," he joked.
That demographic group "was previously ignored by us," Mr. le Comte said, "because they didn't represent good economic prospects" -- that is, if they drank coffee at all, it was less expensive brands than those bearing the Valdez logo to indicate they are made with 100 percent Colombian beans.
This is not the first attempt at altering coffee's older, stodgier image. Perhaps the best-known previous example was a campaign created in 1983 by Advertising to Women that urged young adults to "Join the coffee achievers."
But now the timing seems better, as anyone who has noticed the crowds of 20- and 30-somethings congregating in coffee bars, coffee houses and coffee cafes might have deduced.
"In the last few years, there has been a movement of younger people to drink coffee, particularly specialty coffees," said Salim Janna, managing director at the Colombian coffee federation in New York.
"The end result is benefiting the coffee grower in Colombia," he added, because that nation is "the biggest player" in the specialty coffee niche market; there are more than 40 nationally marketed coffee brands sporting the Valdez logo.
"The coffee houses poking up everywhere" also help Colombian coffee, Mr. Janna said, because the "best ones, with their upscale looks and upscale feel," reinforce the sales spiel about the product's premium status.
The premium-price pitch is apparently well ingrained in American popular culture. A recent installment of the nationally syndicated "Grin and Bear It" cartoon featured a grocer explaining to a shopper that coffee prices were rising because "all those airlines turned around and came back for Colombian coffee" -- the plot of a commercial in the mainstream campaign.
The commercials in the new campaign were filmed in black and white and include, in the retro-chic style popular among younger consumers, brief clips from old commercials -- in this instance, spots for Colombian coffee produced by a DDB Needham Worldwide predecessor agency, Doyle Dane Bernbach, which was awarded the account in 1959. (Coincidentally, a campaign introduced last month by Ogilvy & Mather New York for Kraft Foods' Maxwell House coffee, carrying the theme "Good things have a way of lasting," incorporates bits of old Maxwell House spots into its new ones.)
One youth-slanted Colombian coffee commercial, spoofing personals ads, is called "Classified"; it also has a print counterpart. The spot presents a "single male bean; rich; good taste; not part of the crowd; looking to share intimacy in steamy relationship." Another commercial promises a debate on "stirring -- clockwise or counterclockwise?"
The new campaign also has a different media schedule than the mainstream campaign, which has a 1995 budget of more than $20 million. For instance, the new spots will appear on youth-oriented cable television networks like ESPN, MTV and VH-1.

HEADLINE: Construction Spending Rose 0.7% in November

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Construction spending grew in November for the fourth consecutive month, led by a sharp increase in private financing, the Commerce Department reported today.
Total spending rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, to $522.7 billion, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, the Commerce Department said. A 1.9 percent advance in private financing offset a 2.7 percent decline in government expenditures. It was the largest gain in private spending since a 2.7 percent advance last March, and the biggest drop in public spending since a 6.1 percent plunge last January. 
 Spending totaled a revised $518.9 billion annual rate in October, when spending rose nine-tenths of 1 percent. The initial October estimate was $518.1 billion. The latest advance meant that November expenditures were 6.6 percent above those of a year earlier.
Some analysts attributed the increase in private financing to warm weather in much of the nation during November. But they cautioned that higher interest rates were beginning to curb private spending, particularly in the single-family residential sector.
Indeed, higher borrowing costs were blamed for falling home sales in November. Purchases of new homes in November dropped for the first time in five months, while sales of previously owned homes plunged to the lowest level in 17 months.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, said 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.18 percent in November, up from 7.15 percent last February when the Federal Reserve began raising rates to keep inflation under control.
The increase would add more than $200 to the monthly payment on a $150,000 mortgage.
Residential spending rose eight-tenths of 1 percent, to a $239.3 billion annual rate, after falling half of 1 percent in October. This sector represents nearly half of overall construction outlays.
Single-family outlays edged up one-tenth of 1 percent and reversed a five-month string of decreases. Single-family construction is highly sensitive to mortgage rate changes.
Expenditures for multifamily residences -- apartments and condominiums -- jumped 5.3 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
As Japanese Bonds Dive, Dollar Rises Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied yesterday to a 21-week high against the yen, drawing strength from a bond-market selloff in Tokyo and a United States Government report favoring a stronger currency.
But the yen's broad weakening limited the dollar's gains against leading European currencies as foreign investors dumped Japanese Government bonds and then sold yen for German marks and other currencies, market participants said. 
 The dollar rose as high as 101.46 yen yesterday, its highest level since Aug. 11, before retreating to 101.36 yen in New York, up from 100.68 Tuesday. It rose to 1.5590 marks, from 1.5565 marks on Tuesday.
The gains against the yen came mostly in Asia and Europe. Traders in Tokyo returned from New Year vacations to find that the dollar had sharply risen in American dealings on Tuesday. The advance was reinforced by yen selling resulting from the move out of Japanese Government bonds.
Koichi Takenaka, a vice president of the Industrial Bank of Japan in New York, said the Tokyo bond selloff might have partly resulted from foreign investors' needing to raise cash to cover losses on slumping Mexican assets.
But in recent months, analysts have also been expecting a downturn in foreign investment in Japan as American securities become more attractive.
Amy Smith, currency strategist for a New York analytical service, IDEA, said there was considerable activity in buying of dollar-yen options and rumors of a large contract for a 102-yen dollar rate due to mature tomorrow.
The dollar was also bolstered by a statement late Tuesday from the Treasury Department, emphasizing the benefits of a higher dollar. The Treasury, in an annual report to Congress on exchange-rate policy, reiterated Clinton Administration statements favoring a stronger dollar.
The dollar has also been supported by expectations of higher interest rates in the United States. Many currency dealers expect the Federal Reserve to again raise rates after the Jan. 31-Feb. 1 meeting of its rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
In other currency trading yesterday, the dollar slipped to 1.3105 Swiss francs from 1.3145 on Tuesday. The British pound fell to $1.5605 from $1.5630, while the Canadian dollar rose to 71.50 United States cents from 71.16 cents.

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH Arlene Eisenberg, Heidi E. Murkoff and Sandee E. Hathaway;
The Baby Makers

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
IT was an odd sort of family reunion. A photographer had assumed command of Arlene Eisenberg's living room and seemed to be trying to cajole Ms. Eisenberg and her two daughters into a posture that at least suggested family.
The women looked stiff. The photographer persisted. Ever so solicitously, she said things like, "Is it wrong to have your hand on each other's shoulder, like you're relating physically? Would that work?" 
 When she packed up, another photographer arrived. How about some physical contact? she suggested brightly. Could the grandchildren come downstairs? she wondered. The answer was unambiguous: no.
The curiously unadvertised fact about the co-authors of the wildly successful field guides to pregnancy and parenthood, "What to Expect When You're Expecting," "What to Eat When You're Expecting," "What to Expect the First Year" and now "What to Expect the Toddler Years," is that Ms. Eisenberg, Heidi E. Murkoff and Sandee E. Hathaway are themselves a mother and her daughters.
It's not that they hide the fact, exactly. They allude to it, fleetingly, in the introductions to several of the books. But when asked to talk about it, they insist it is irrelevant. They say it plays no role in what they do.
They say they work together because, in effect, they know and admire each other's work. They say they barely remember any conflict. Maybe three times in 10 years they seriously disagreed; they can't remember about what.
"You work as professional co-authors, and you don't bring the rest of it into that," insisted Ms. Murkoff, a small, dark-haired woman of conspicuous focus and will. "Because if you did, you'd be doomed."
Is that possible? she was asked.
"Completely possible," she said crisply. "It's not an issue."
Perhaps there was a time when consumer confidence might not have been set afire by the idea of a pregnancy manual written by a mother-daughter combo (whose most successful previously published collaboration happened to be a cookbook for dinner parties attended by guests with special dietary needs). Pregnancy-book authors tended to be obstetricians with boxcars of initials appended to their names when "What to Expect When You're Expecting" came out 10 years ago.
But since that time, "What to Expect When You're Expecting" has become a phenomenon in the field. There are more than four million copies in print. (Dr. Benjamin Spock's "Baby and Child Care" has sold more than 40 million copies, but it's been in print since 1946.) "What to Expect" is a baby-shower staple on a par with receiving blankets and Onesies, the essential complement to the modern mother's bottle warmer and diaper bag. From mother to mothers, like a chain letter, it is networking its way around the globe. A Czech edition is under negotiation; 21 other foreign editions are already out or under contract.
The book has also become the cornerstone of an ever-growing electronic cottage industry operated by Ms. Eisenberg, Ms. Murkoff and Ms. Hathaway via computer and fax from three states. There are the three published sequels, two regular magazine columns, and a pregnancy planner in the works. Ms. Murkoff lectures around the country. And there is serious talk of tailoring and giving away a new version of the pregnancy book for low-income women.
What appears to distinguish the books is their accessible, nonjudgmental approach. They try to address Everyparent's every question, even those that most parents wouldn't dare ask a doctor. (Is the fetus aware that we're having sex? In a word, no.) The authors pride themselves on certain principles: every parent and every child is different; the only imperatives in child-rearing are safety, health and love.
The authors present themselves as highly informed lay people, which they are. Ms. Eisenberg, 60, of New York is a freelance journalist; Ms. Murkoff, 36, of Santa Fe, N.M., is a writer, and Ms. Hathaway, 40, of Newton, Mass., is a nonpracticing nurse. They have eight children between them. They ask smart questions, summarize conflicting evidence and land squarely in the mainstream, siding with the likes of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Exploring the minutiae of parental preoccupations, they are meticulously evenhanded. Take their discussion of parental nudity. They weigh the pros and cons, then wind up with a homily: "What children need to learn is that the body, naked or covered, should be respected and taken care of; it should be considered beautiful, rather than embarrassing. And most important it should be under the control of the person who inhabits it."
"We can help you make an informed decision," Ms. Murkoff said. "That's all we can do."
Recently, Workman, their publisher, reunited the authors in New York and held a carnival at the Puck Building in downtown Manhattan to celebrate the 10th birthday of the first book. There were clowns on stilts, carnival games, free food and hundreds of stroller-pushing "What to Expect" families. The next morning, the authors gathered to talk in the West Side brownstone apartment where Ms. Eisenberg and her husband, Howard, have lived since moving to Manhattan from Spring Valley, N.Y., 14 years ago.
On the living-room bookshelves stood framed photographs of the Eisenbergs' three children and their children's children, along with dozens of copies of foreign editions of the "What to Expect" books.
In a small office upstairs that she and her daughters pronounced too cluttered to be photographed, Ms. Eisenberg puts in 14-hour days. She subscribes to a dozen medical newsletters and journals, tracking new developments that might need to be incorporated with each new printing, every six to eight weeks.
But the driving force behind the enterprise is Ms. Murkoff. When she was in her early 20's, she worked for an advertising firm figuring out how to sell things like spaghetti sauce. When she quit and became pregnant with her daughter, Emma, she found that every pregnancy book she read filled her with dread.
They convinced her that her fetus was doomed -- either because of the hormone her doctor had prescribed before she knew she was pregnant or because of the few drinks she had drunk before she knew. The memory still annoys her. "This fetus is now 11 years old. She has all her arms and legs and is not mentally retarded, far from it," Ms. Murkoff said. "My pregnancy was completely normal."
"And so were your fears," Ms. Eisenberg said.
Which is, of course, the point. Out of that experience came "What to Expect When You're Expecting." It was Ms. Murkoff's personal crusade. "The more women like ourselves read, the more we panic," she said. "I was determined that no one have to go through what I went through." Just hours before she delivered Emma, Ms. Murkoff and her mother delivered to their agent their proposal for the first reassuring guide to pregnancy.
Why did you turn to your mother and sister? Ms. Murkoff was asked.
"It really had nothing to do with them being related," she said.
In a way, writing had always been a family business. Though the Eisenberg children had grown up in Garden City, L.I., and in Spring Valley, they had spent two years traveling in Europe and Israel with their parents, both freelance writers, accompanying them on interviews.
All three children went on to become writers, at least in part. The Eisenbergs' son, Evan, 39, is currently writing a book. Ms. Eisenberg herself began specializing in medical topics after writing a college textbook on health. So it was natural, Ms. Murkoff said, to turn to her and Ms. Hathaway, who was working as an obstetrical nurse.
The collaboration works well. Ms. Murkoff handles the bone structure of the books -- the snappy questions and answers at which her mother says she is especially gifted. Ms. Eisenberg does the medical reporting and updating. Ms. Hathaway tends to serve as editor, applying her medically trained ear.
For the latest book, "What to Expect the Toddler Years," Ms. Hathaway's youngest child, Elizabeth, now 3, served as "test toddler," an infallible model of toddler idiosyncrasies. Ms. Murkoff wrote the bulk of the nearly 900-page tome herself. When it came out in November, it immediately hit the Publishers Weekly paperback best-seller list.
Ms. Murkoff declined to say precisely how the books' profits are divided except that the distribution reflects the distribution of labor. Asked if the books had made the family rich, she said: "We're making a nice living. I wouldn't say rich."
For their next project, inspired by the positive response their seminar at Rikers Island received, the three women hope to find a way to distribute an edition of the pregnancy book specifically tailored to low-income women.
They are well aware of certain incongruities in what they do: they are supplying information about pregnancy when most women and their babies are at less risk than ever before. But the women who are at greatest risk are the least informed.
"Ironically, we who have the least to worry about worry the most," Ms. Murkoff said. "And the women today who have the most to worry about are the women who have the least information."
Some of the advice dispensed in the books does not, of course, square with what was accepted when Ms. Eisenberg was having children. She remembers being the lone breast-feeding mother on her hospital floor, being instructed to gain no more than 15 pounds and hearing repeatedly that infants could be spoiled by being picked up too much.
These days, she runs a weekly discussion group for parents of babies under a year old. They meet every Wednesday at Ansche Chesed Temple on West 100th Street -- a few dozen women and their babies, occasionally a father or two -- to hash out such weighty matters as "Why is my kid banging on everything?"
"For me, it's important to have hands-on experience every week with babies," she said. "Besides, I get my baby fix."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Lawmakers Pursue 'Contract With Fans'

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
In an effort to spur agreement on a new labor contract in baseball, members of Congress intruded on the Republicans' "Contract with America" yesterday, introducing five baseball bills ranging from complete repeal of the sport's antitrust exemption to binding arbitration to settle the nearly five-month-old strike.
A total of three bills, two calling for complete repeal of the exemption, had been expected from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, and Representative Michael Bilirakis, Republican of Florida, on the first day of the 104th Congress. But two Democratic Representatives also introduced bills, both of which had seen brief life in the last term. 
 Pat Williams of Montana reintroduced his bill that would require the owners and players to submit to binding arbitration if they did not reach agreement by Feb. 1, although the date will most likely be pushed back a month.
John Conyers of Michigan offered a bill that made it out of the House Judiciary Committee last term, proposing that any unilateral implementation of new work rules become subject to the antitrust laws.
It was a flurry of legislative activity on baseball that could hardly have been expected two months ago when Republicans won control of the House for the first time in 40 years and promised to take quick action on the "Contract With America" theme that was the focal point of the party's campaign.
"Congress always has been very cautious to intervene in collective bargaining," Williams said. "With the new Republican majority and their almost Pollyanna belief to allow the marketplace its own will, passing the bill will be difficult." But he added: "An increasing number of members of Congress are beginning to understand the future of baseball as we know the game in our lifetime is in peril. That fact encourages Congress to act and perhaps act dramatically."
The interest in the labor dispute apparently won't end with yesterday's activity. Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican from Utah and new chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is considering introducing a bill aimed at limited repeal of the exemption baseball has had since 1922. The Hatch bill probably would most closely resemble Conyers's effort.
"He hasn't said he definitely will do it, but he is considering it," Paul Smith, a Hatch spokesman, said by telephone from Washington. "He did say he thought if his bill passed, the players would be back for spring training. That, to me, says he's going to do something fast."
While the proposed bills flew into the hoppers in the Senate and the House of Representatives, baseball management people discussed not how to end the strike, but how to proceed with spring training and the season if the strike continues.
In two telephone conference calls, members of the 10-man operations committee discussed such issues as replacement players and ticket prices if they are used. John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox, the committee chairman, did not return a telephone call seeking comment on the calls, and others declined to be specific.
"We had a lot of discussions that were of a preliminary basis," Dave Dombrowski, general manager of the Florida Marlins, said by telephone from his office. "We discussed a lot of different questions and issues facing us. We reached no conclusions. We'll have further discussions."
Donald Fehr, head of the players' union, was closer to the action in Washington. He and Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, met with Secretary of Labor Robert Reich for about 40 minutes.
"We brought him up to date on the current situation," Fehr said. "He asked a number of questions."
Asked if Reich requested that the players resume talks with the owners, Fehr said: "Not directly. He knows we're prepared to resume when they want to. We didn't walk away from the table; they did. We didn't impose terms; they did."
Speaking of the moves in Congress, Fehr said: "Momentum is building. It's clear the Congress is becoming more and more aware of the freak in the law that has produced this dispute. I am encouraged."
Not surprisingly, Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, did not hold a similar view.
"When you look back at the antitrust exemption, this doesn't create any potential solution; that's total mythology," he said from Milwaukee. "But more important than that, you're dealing with arguably the most successful union in labor history. They've achieved unbelievable gains with baseball having this antitrust exemption. The fact is we need a collective bargaining agreement. This is mere diversion and doesn't contribute to that end at all."
But the lawmakers who acted yesterday obviously think their bills could have an impact on the dispute, and even get the game going again.
"My approach is the most efficient way to play ball," Williams, the outgoing chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, said in a telephone interview. "That's all I'm interested in, getting the boys back on the field."
Williams had originally targeted Feb. 1 as the deadline for an agreement before the dispute went to binding arbitration and March 15 for a decision by the three-man arbitration board. But he acknowledged yesterday the reality of the calendar probably would push those dates back a month.
Representative Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, worked during the last term of Congress with Jack Brooks, a Texas Democrat and the former committee chairman who lost his bid for re-election in November, on a bill similar to the one he introduced yesterday.
Calling for unilaterally implemented rules to be subject to antitrust laws, Conyers said in a statement, "The end result of baseball's special treatment has been the perpetuation of a closed, cartelized industry in which the few, incumbent club owners possess inordinate power and every other party -- including players, fans and municipalities -- remain economically marginalized."
He said the current situation may "demand an even stronger response and a broader repeal," adding, "But, in my judgment, this is an appropriate starting point for developing a bipartisan consensus on the issue in the Judiciary Committee and the full House."
Conyers kept his bill narrow rather than calling for complete repeal of the exemption in the hope that the Republican majority would not see it as interfering with the "Contract With America" legislation. The bill clearly is designed to attract bipartisan support.

HEADLINE: The Gingrich Paradox

 BODY:
There is no way of telling yet whether Newt Gingrich's inaugural speech to the House of Representatives yesterday was a genuine expression of born-again statesmanship or a brilliant tactical exercise. One hopes the former is true, that his gracious speech was not merely a masterly effort to make his "Contract With America" more palatable, but the emergence of a politician larger and more generous than his agenda. In any case, it was a surprising and startlingly effective performance -- animated, anecdotal, humane. It also left little doubt that, at least for the moment, Newt Gingrich is America's pivotal political figure, Bill Clinton and Bob Dole included.
Nor is there any telling how long the Speaker's magnanimity will last. It certainly was not in evidence during the snarly press conference that preceded his swearing-in. But once he took the gavel, he could hardly have done a better job of portraying his avowedly partisan "Contract With America" as an inclusive and non-threatening document that even his opponents could embrace without fear. Nor could he have been more energetic in his efforts -- we are "commoners together," he said of the House -- to invite his critics' help. 
 The man who vowed to dismantle much of the welfare state paid effusive tribute to its chief architect, Franklin Roosevelt. The partisan who has spent every second of his waking life over the past 10 years seeking to create a Republican hegemony gave exclusive credit to the Democrats for bringing about desegregation; the man seen as insensitive to the underclass declared that even his cherished balanced budget does not have "the moral urgency of coming to grips with what's happening to the poorest Americans."
Mr. Gingrich had a wider audience in mind than the Democrats -- a public that volcanically expressed its disgust with the way Washington, and in particular Congress, runs itself. His stated determination to make the House an open, responsive institution contrasted refreshingly with the business-as-usual approach of the old leadership. The new majority missed a coup in not swiftly adding the Democrats' belated gift ban to Mr. Gingrich's own proposals to clean up committee rules and open the House to more television coverage.
The emotional high point was Mr. Gingrich's warning to his own party that privatization and profits cannot override the need for caring social programs. The lingering question, of course, is how to square the inclusive rhetoric with his divisive budget strategies.
Applause for Mr. Gingrich's political resolve should not drown out criticism of his many misguided proposals. He backs tax cuts that he says will help middle-class families and stimulate economic growth. But the proposed cuts -- on capital gains, corporate investment and retirement saving -- are ill designed to promote savings and investment and, as Representative Richard Gephardt argues, tilt toward those with incomes over $200,000.
Since Social Security, Medicare and defense are exempt, the House G.O.P.'s desired $200 billion in spending cuts would have to come from programs on which Congress now spends about $450 billion. That means cutting about 40 percent of every remaining program from border patrol to medical research. This points up the central injustice -- and hypocrisy -- about the way Mr. Gingrich wants to go about reform. He pledges to balance the budget by aiming spending cuts at the most undefended citizens. Meanwhile, the well-off would get subsidies through the tax system for such benefits as unlimited mortgage interest deductions or high-cost health insurance.
So, in its current rendition, Mr. Gingrich's fiscal austerity is inherently unfair. He hinted that middle-class entitlements like Medicare and farm subsidies, as well as defense, would eventually bear some of the burden. That suggestion and his speech raise the hope that this unusual man's zeal for reform may, in time, be tempered by grander impulses toward mercy and equity.

HEADLINE: Student Loan Program Tells a Success Story

 BODY:
To the Editor:
David Lipsky's "Young, Eager and Deep in Debt" (Op-Ed, Dec. 29) states that "by 1990, the average college student was graduating $10,000 in the red." The average student was doing no such thing. A study sponsored by the Education Department shows that 55 percent of college graduates had no educational debts upon graduation in 1990. Of the 45 percent who did have such debts, half owed less than $7,000. 
 Mr. Lipsky says that "during the recession that began in 1990, many graduates were unable to repay" their loans, leading to a 17 percent default rate. The default rate among graduates who took loans is about 6 percent and did not increase appreciably during the recession. The more education individuals receive, the less likely they are to default.
The doubling of the default rate in the 15 years before 1992 was due almost exclusively to the increase in borrowers at "schools" offering short-term training, hundreds of which have been eliminated from the loan program in the last two years. These ripoff artists left their students with few or no skills and large debts. College graduates get skills, they get jobs, and they repay their loans.
Mr. Lipsky notes that banks make a huge profit on student loans, but does not state that under the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, most loans will be made by the Federal Government directly to students, with no subsidy going to the banks. As of next July 1, 40 percent of all student loans will be made in this fashion.
Mr. Lipsky praises President Clinton for creating a program that allows students to "pay off loans in proportion to their incomes," but criticizes him for not making the plan retroactive. Such a repayment plan was just implemented by the Department of Education and is available for students who have graduated. Information may be obtained from (800) 433-3243.
The Department of Education study showed that the average borrower spent 5 percent of income paying off college debts the year after leaving school. However, 8 percent of borrowers were spending more than 10 percent of their income repaying their student loans. It is these students who are facing serious problems, and who are the folks policy makers should worry about.
Mr. Lipsky repeats the canard that colleges use availability of Federal aid as an excuse to raise tuition, which stimulates more borrowing. But borrowing increases whenever Congress makes more people eligible or raises loan limits, as it has several times in the last 30 years. This pattern holds, whether tuitions are rising at a rate lower than inflation, as in the 1970's, or higher than inflation, as in recent years.
Most borrowers find that Federal student loans make it possible for them to attend college, and the vast majority of graduates repay their loans on schedule, without complaint, grateful for the opportunity they received.

HEADLINE: U.S. Military Has Real Readiness Problem

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Are U.S. Forces Ready to Fight?" (editorial, Dec. 27) concludes that the military is not facing a serious readiness problem. You premise this conclusion on the assumption that since the Pentagon's operations and maintenance budgets are larger and its force structure smaller than a decade ago, when readiness was unquestioned, there ought not to be a problem today. 
 If you had done an apples-to-apples comparison of operations and maintenance financing over the last 15 years, using constant fiscal year 1995 dollars (adjusted for inflation), you would see the 1994 and 1995 defense budgets provided the lowest levels of such financing since 1982.
Moreover, in recent years overall operations and maintenance financing has had little direct correlation to readiness, since these accounts must also cover the mounting costs of nondefense initiatives that have little bearing on troop training and readiness.
You imply that my concerns over military readiness are based exclusively on three Army divisions. My conclusions were based on extensive discussions with enlisted personnel and officers of all the services. You chose not to address the evidence I presented on Navy, Marine Corps or Air Force readiness problems.
However, even if I confine myself to your narrow interpretation of my conclusions, your logic is disturbing. While the Army's 2d Armored and 24th Infantry Divisions are "heavy" and would have fought similarly "heavy" Soviet divisions in a cold war conflict, they fought Iraqi Republican Guard divisions in the post-cold war Operation Desert Storm.
Considering that the United States has deployed "heavy" forces twice in the last four years in response to aggression in the Persian Gulf, I do not believe the American public would support your advice to shortchange these units because keeping them ready in view of the Army's downsizing is a "waste of money."
The military is suffering through the early stages of a long-term readiness problem. You do Americans a disservice by explaining away this growing problem as little more than politicians grandstanding and military commanders underestimating their own readiness to manipulate the debate.

HEADLINE: Economy in New York Region Is Stagnant, Unlike the Nation's

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Economic expansion and job growth in the New York region have come to a virtual halt since July, and higher interest rates are further undermining the region's prospects, according to economists, executives and government officials.
Although the New York region shows few signs of sinking back into recession, the experts say the local economy remains one of the weakest in the nation, when business activity elsewhere is so robust that the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since February to ward off inflation. 
 Whatever impact higher interest rates may have in slowing the national expansion, they seem certain to hurt New York City and the surrounding areas. Several of the region's main industries -- the banks and brokerage houses of Manhattan, the military contractors of Connecticut and Long Island, and the pharmaceutical companies of New Jersey -- are shedding thousands of workers and slashing salaries, and those cuts, along with the higher interest rates, are helping to drag down other sectors of the economy.
"Just when things started looking like they were going to improve, buyers dropped out," said Bob Sullivan, a sales associate at Prudential-Degnan Boyle Real Estate in Montclair, N.J., where, according to company records, 21 homes changed hands in November, fewer than half the number sold each month in the first half of 1994.
The lagging economy could complicate plans by the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to cut taxes. And on Tuesday, aides to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said New York City's business tax revenues are expected to be $200 million lower than anticipated for the fourth quarter of 1994, largely because of weaknesses in the banking and investment industries.
The regional economy does retain pockets of growth. Tourism has soared, helped in part by the low value of the dollar, which has made the region a bargain for foreigners. In New York City, hotels report a steady increase during the last six months in occupancy and room rates, while the region's three international airports report a surge in passengers, both foreign and domestic. But while hotels may be full, many office buildings struggle to find renters for vacant space.
Economists say the local economy is lagging because of several factors. Wall Street, a traditional engine of New York City's economy, had a tough 1994 because of a poor bond market and a lackluster year for stocks. And the growth in manufacturing that has fueled the nationwide recovery has largely bypassed the Northeast's aging or abandoned plants. Furthermore, high costs in the Northeast, from housing to taxes to business expenses, have discouraged expansion.
"The contrast between the brisk job expansion that we are seeing nationally, and what we are seeing here, has grown even more striking," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the New York regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
New York State has lost 13,300 jobs since July, 4,800 of them in New York City, Mr. Ehrenhalt said. Connecticut lost 4,200 jobs in November after steady employment growth. New Jersey remains a bright spot, having added 15,400 jobs from July through November.
 
Wall Street
Profits Dry Up At Growth Engine
 Among the region's leading industries, the securities sector, comprised mainly of Manhattan's brokerage houses and investment banks, has had a particularly rough time.
These companies made large profits from 1988 to 1993, and played crucial roles in leading the region to the beginning of its recovery in late 1993. But in 1994, "Wall Street has been clobbered," said Matthew Drennan, an economist at New York University.
With only 145,000 workers in a regional work force of more than 12 million, the securities industry's importance is not so much in the number it employs as in the money its workers make: in good times, salaries and bonuses for many executives far exceed $100,000, and for some they top $1 million. This money is spent on restaurants, clothing, cars and other merchandise, thereby creating other jobs.
But the securities industry, more than any other sector, has been hurt by rising interest rates. Several of the largest Manhattan firms reported huge losses from their bond trading operations -- which try to anticipate swings in the nation's credit markets -- when interest rates began to rise in the spring.
In addition, the stock markets are ending a lackluster year of modest gains. Since the region's brokerage houses trade in huge amounts of their own money as well as that of their clients, the disappointing results of the market mean reduced profits for 1994.
Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, a securities industry research firm in Summit, N.J., said he expected profits by companies that are members of the New York Stock Exchange -- which employ more than half of the region's securities industry workers -- to be less than half the $8.6 billion they reported in 1993. As a result, the year-end bonuses many in the industry got have been cut to less than half of last year's, he said.
 
Manufacturing
The Casualties Of Pentagon Cuts
 Manufacturers in the region, who have been shedding workers and abandoning plants for decades, have continued to do so, despite the robust turnaround experienced by manufacturers elsewhere in the nation.
The problems, moreover, are not confined to old industries like the garment makers of New York and machine shops of Connecticut, which had lost much business to foreign competition long before the New York region sank into recession. Some industries that had been the region's strongest are now being undermined by complex economic shifts that are unlikely to reverse course.
The industry serving the Pentagon, for instance, was long one of the most stable employers in the region, with companies like Pratt & Whitney and the Electric Boat Company of Connecticut and the Northrop Grumman Corporation on Long Island. But with sharp cuts in military spending, all three have announced large numbers of layoffs, with the cuts totaling over 10,000 jobs. More reductions are expected.
"Dozens of people here have moved to the South or the Midwest," said John Beauregard, executive director of the Southeastern Connecticut Private Industry Council, which operates a job-placement service in Groton for workers laid off by the Electric Boat Company, a maker of submarines. The company has reduced its Connecticut work force from 17,000 to 12,000 since 1993, and plans to cut another 6,000 over the next four years.
In Dutchess County, N.Y., where International Business Machines has its largest concentration of plants, the company began a series of big layoffs in 1993, and the cuts continue.
Like those laid off by Electric Boat, many of those cut by I.B.M. have advanced engineering or electronic skills, and would probably find jobs if they moved to another region. But few have, said Tony Nicotra, director of the Poughkeepsie Career Center.
"Our success rate has been good, but not in finding people jobs in the same field they left," he said, adding the some of the laid-off workers have turned to jobs like truck driving, have opened art galleries or have started other small businesses.
Another once-robust part of the region's economy is the pharmaceutical industry of central and northern New Jersey, where Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Company, Ciba-Geigy and a dozen other companies operate the nation's largest concentration of drug laboratories and manufacturing plants. These companies have laid off more than 10,000 people since August 1993 as the health-care industry seeks to cut costs.
Robert Pellet, executive director of the New Jersey Health Products Council, a trade group, said the problems facing the industry are likely to continue as cost-conscious health-care companies try to economize.
 
Bright Spots
New Jersey Stands Out
 While statistics show many weak spots in the region's economy, there are pockets of hope. The region's smaller start-up companies are soaking up new workers. Dun & Bradstreet, the research firm, said the number of business starts in the region increased by 12 percent in the first 11 months of 1994, after declining in the previous year. And the number of business failures dropped by 25 percent in those first 11 months of 1994.
Among the three states in the region, New Jersey stands out as the strongest. That state gained jobs every month this year except for September, according to Federal government data through November.
Like the rest of the nation, New York City and its suburbs are reaping the gains from an upturn in some areas of consumer spending, particularly auto sales, which have been buoyed by pent-up demand from people who put off buying during the recession.
"We've got a shortage of Blazers and a shortage of Luminas," said Arnold Frankel, sales manager of Turnpike Chevrolet in East Meadow, L.I. "Once they come in the door, they'll be sold."
Christmas sales across the region, however, were a disappointment.
"The New York region underperformed the nation," said Isaac Lagnado, publisher of the Tactical Retail Monitor, an industry newsletter. He said sales in New York City and its suburbs increased by 5 percent over the 1993 holiday season, compared with a 6.5 percent gain for the nation.
 
Taxes
After Promises, Painful Reality
 The timing of the region's economic slowdown may be particularly nettlesome for four of its top political leaders -- Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City -- all of whom have promised to cut taxes, bringing about the most concerted interstate reversal of fiscal policy in the nation.
But a weak economy, generating few new jobs and little income growth, produces lower-than-expected tax revenue, and economic advisers to all four leaders are nervously revising the financial forecasts.
Indeed, in New York and New Jersey, officials are projecting large budget deficits that can only grow deeper if the economy does not improve. Advisers to Governor Pataki said the New York State deficit would be at least $100 million for the fiscal year ending March 31, and Governor Whitman faces the prospect of a deficit exceeding $1 billion for New Jersey's fiscal year, which ends June 30.
The slowdown in New York State's economy "gives us something to contend with," said Donna Arduin, that state's newly appointed first deputy budget director, in an interview on Friday.
Ms. Arduin said Mr. Pataki remains committed to cutting taxes. "A weak economy means taxpayers need to keep as much of their income as they can," she said. "It just means you cut more spending."
In New York City, forecasts of tax receipts have proven far too optimistic since its fiscal year began on July 1. By October, advisers to Mayor Giuliani said the tax shortfall amounted to $170 million, so they revised their forecasts downward for the rest of the year.
Nonetheless, tax collections in the city have continued to fall short of expectations. According to the City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, the city's revenue for December from four of its biggest taxes, including the personal income and general corporation taxes, were $188.3 million less than expected.
Because of the weaker-than-expected tax receipts, Mr. Hevesi said Mayor Giuliani and Governor Pataki would be forced to move "very slowly and carefully" in their attempts to cut taxes.
Unless the economy improves, "We are looking at a lot of pain for a lot of people in both the city and the state," he said.

HEADLINE: First 81 Teachers Qualify For National Certification

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
In a move to professionalize teaching and raise its standards, a crop of veteran teachers has become the first to receive national teaching certification.
The 81 middle-school and junior high teachers, who had to pass a stringent yearlong assessment, were announced yesterday in Washington by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. 
Certification does not replace current licensing, but many educators hope that National Board teachers who move to another state will be able to avoid sometimes cumbersome recertification and start work right away. In addition, the educators hope that states and local school districts will reward these teachers with higher pay and greater responsibilities.
Already, North Carolina has promised a 4 percent raise and reimbursement of the $975 exam fee for teachers who complete the certification program. Iowa, North Carolina, New Mexico and Oklahoma have agreed to waive state licensing requirements for nationally certified teachers who relocate there. Other states, including Massachusetts and Ohio, will accept the national certification as an alternative to their own state recertification program.
Educators said the National Board initiative paralleled that for other professionals, like doctors. It sets high standards, including extensive evaluations of classroom performance and a battery of exams testing the teacher's knowledge, rather than the minimum thresholds that state licenses usually require.
"It's a moment that is every bit as historic as the changes that came about in the medical profession when they decided to set high standards," said Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, who heads the 63-member board.
"We're going to have, for the first time, a true and recognized profession of teaching that is respected and one that I believe will be far more attractive to young people coming along who are considering their careers," Governor Hunt, a Democrat, said, "and I think one that will be attractive for teachers to stay in."
The certification program, which has been developed over the last eight years with $55 million in Federal and philanthropic support, has broad support among educators, business leaders, governors and the presidents of the nation's two largest teacher unions.
Connie Mitchell, a teacher in Detroit's public schools, was among the 81 pioneering teachers to meet the National Board's standards.
"I'm very excited," said Ms. Mitchell, who teaches reading and computer literacy at the Noble School for kindergartners to eighth-graders. "Part of the reason that people have not looked at us as a profession is because we have not had standards. Doctors have standards. Lawyers have standards. Now teachers have the same set-up, and that is going to be very important to the profession."
Over the course of several months in the 1993-94 school year, Ms. Mitchell and the 288 other candidates had to compile portfolios of their work, videotape their classroom instruction, submit lesson plans, their students' work and write reams of analyses reflecting on how they have helped students learn. The candidates then went to an assessment center, where among other things, they evaluated videos of other teachers; were tested on their own knowledge of English, science, history and health, and devised comprehensive lesson plans involving either systems of government, ecosystems or the influence of the media.
Whether the advanced certification will allow teachers to walk into many states without meeting additional state requirements remains to be seen. According to Ernest Boyer, the president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching: "It could easily establish some benchmarks that would influence state licensing and state certification and, who knows, it could also send signals to teacher training programs. It's a project that is saying that there are standards of excellence that can be defined."
In New Jersey, a spokesman for the Education Department said the state endorsed the national program and was considering how to recognize nationally certified teachers. Officials for state education departments in New York and Connecticut said they had no immediate plans to recognize national certification.
But expressing the view of some education administrators, Tom Murphy, a spokesman for the Connecticut Education Department, said, "The difference may come in how local school districts, the employing agencies, how they treat that status. They might provide stipends through their contracts but it's up to the localities."
Some local districts are already providing incentives for teachers. The Jericho, L.I., district will reimburse the application fee for all teachers who complete the process; give a one-time $4,000 stipend to nationally certified teachers and pay a one-time $2,000 stipend to teachers who try but do not pass.
But to some educators, the new process raises as many questions as it seeks to remedy. In the short term, they say, the lives of a vast majority of teachers will not be affected. Licenses to teach are still controlled at the state level; financial incentives are far from certain in an era of tightening school budgets, and there is concern that teachers in wealthier districts will be rewarded in greater numbers than teachers from poorer districts because they may have more time and money to apply.
"I think the consistent concern of this group is that the certification process will omit a whole series of individuals who are most in need of additional training," said Michael Casserly, a spokesman for the Council of Great City Schools, a nonprofit Washington group representing the country's biggest districts. "It's a good first step on a very, very long road and it's a road that is going to require all manner of vigilance to insure that urban teachers have the same opportunities for certification as others."
But a new Federal law now allows schools to use elementary and secondary school money to help teachers seek the certification, said James A. Kelly, president of the National Board, who said states and districts were being urged to support the program financially. "We are doing everything we can to look at this issue," Mr. Kelly said.
The national certification board, created in 1987, was a central recommendation of a landmark report, "A Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century," issued by the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy. The report was one of several in the mid-1980's urging drastic changes in the nation's schools, including the scathing "A Nation at Risk" in 1983 by the Department of Education that resulted in stricter graduation requirements and more emphasis on basic skills.
To be eligible to apply for national certification, teachers must have at least three years of teaching experience, a bachelor's degree and either a state license or a job in a state-accredited school.
The teachers announced yesterday, from 23 states, are all middle school and junior high school teachers who teach multiple subjects. (The Board certificate is called "Early Adolescence/Generalist.") No teacher from New York City received the certificate, but three teachers in New York State, from Stony Brook, Rochester and Penfield, N.Y., three teachers in New Jersy, from Hazlet, Englishtown and Dayton, and one from Newington, Conn.
The certificate is the first of 30 categorized by subject and grade level that will become available to the nation's 2.5 million teachers by the end of the decade. This summer, more than 250 middle-grade English teachers will learn their scores. Among other areas of expertise to be assessed are early adolescence/social studies-history and young adulthood/mathematics.
Arthur Levine, the president of Teachers College, said the establishment of national standards for teacher certification was an experiment that was bound to be complicated because every state had its own licensing procedures.
"The notion of trying to create national standards is much akin to trying to herd cats," Mr. Levine said. "What the board has done is work very hard to make the notion appealing to school systems, states and to universities and to unions. What these first awards symbolize is to provide some sense that around the country there is some agreement on what makes for a good teacher."

HEADLINE: Bombing of Rebel City Lets Up, But Not the Attacks on Yeltsin

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 5

 BODY:
There were reports today of a respite in the bombing of the embattled capital of Chechnya, as ordered by Boris N. Yeltsin. But it brought no reprieve to the Russian President, who remains under attack at home and abroad for his military offensive against the secessionist southern region.
Western press reports from Grozny, the rebel capital, supported Russia's claim that bombing was limited to the outskirts of town, but Russian reports contradicted it. 
 Two members of Russia's Parliament declared in Nazran, near the Chechen border, that Russian planes had bombed some parts of Grozny. Vesti, a news program on state-controlled television, reported that one bomb had been dropped on the presidential palace in the city's center, despite Western reports that the device was a rocket. Another television news program also reported bombing inside Grozny.
The chairman of the President's commission on human rights, Sergei Kovalyov, returned from a three-week stay in Grozny today and said the Yeltsin Government's claims about its military operation in Chechnya were lies that surpassed those of "the Communists and even Goebbels."
Outside Russia, outrage over the killing of hundreds of civilians also grew sharply.
In Washington, after weeks of calling the conflict in Chechnya an internal matter for Russia to solve, the Clinton Administration is set to open a high-level effort with Western Europeans to persuade Russia to accept a negotiated end to the crisis. [Page A8.]
For the first time since Russian troops entered Chechnya on Dec. 11, European governments threatened to try to punish Moscow economically. The European Commission in Brussels said today that it would hold up an interim trade agreement that Russia signed in December as a way of underlining Europe's concern about the killing of civilians.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said that though he still viewed the conflict in Chechnya as an internal Russian matter, he had phoned Mr. Yeltsin on Wednesday to voice his concern about Russia's use of force.
Mr. Kovalyov, who in a news conference likening the blackened, bombed-out neighborhoods of Grozny to Stalingrad in World War II, was given 10 minutes of air time tonight on state-controlled television. He lashed out at some Russian news organizations, accusing them of relying on Government claims of military success and low casualties without sufficient skepticism. He also said he expected to meet with Mr. Yeltsin on Friday to urge him to stop the war.
Today, Mr. Yeltsin's senior aides in charge of the war made contradictory assessments of the Government's efforts to gain control over Chechnya. Mr. Yeltsin's national security adviser, Yuri Baturin, said, "Normalization of the situation in Chechnya is far away." He said he was concerned about the Chechen guerrilla operations there.
But Sergei Stepashin, director of the federal counter-intelligence service, told Russian troops in Grozny that "talk about an endless guerrilla war is just bluff."
Mr. Stepashin, who is one of the Government's most zealous advocates of the war, also said that 8 out of 11 districts in Chechnya supported the Russian armed forces. Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai Yegorov, who is in charge of coordinating the operation in Chechnya, had predicted on Wednesday that Grozny would fall today or Friday.
Mr. Yeltsin's decision to send troops into Chechnya has cost Mr. Yeltsin the support of most of the democratic political leaders who helped bring him to power.
Increasingly isolated, Mr. Yeltsin moved to the right today by appointing a member of the Communist faction of Parliament, Valentin A. Kovalyov, to be his new Justice Minister. Valentin Kovalyov, who is not related to Sergei Kovalyov, had most recently served as the head of an ad hoc committee to monitor human rights in Chechnya created by Mr. Yeltsin to better reflect the Government's position.
Valentin Kovalyov's unwillingness to criticize Russian actions in Chechnya caused members of his faction to ridicule him publicly, but it evidently earned him the gratitude of Mr. Yeltsin.
Other spokesmen for the Government's actions in Chechnya have not fared as well. The head of Russia's information center on Chechnya, Valentin Sergeyev, was reportedly hospitalized in Moscow today with heart trouble. He had been sentenced to death by Islamic supporters of the Chechen leader, Dzhokhar Dudayev, who distributed his home telephone number and address.
Moscow announced that Mr. Sergeyev would be temporarily replaced by Valery Grishin. Mr. Grishin is the third person appointed to head the information center in the last three weeks. The first, Press Minister Sergei Gryzunov, resigned under a barrage of criticism from the Russian press.
And Deputy Prime Minister Sergei M. Shakrai, who strongly supported the war, admitted to the Itar-Tass news agency today that even he sometimes had trouble obtaining reliable information from the Defense Department.

HEADLINE: JAPAN KEEPS PACE IN U.S. CAR MARKET

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 5

 BODY:
American auto makers are celebrating a banner 1994, a year of ready customers and soaring profits. But one stubborn fact emerged today: The Japanese auto makers, despite offering higher-priced cars against American vehicles of improved quality, did not lose any of their share of the nation's car and truck market last year.
In fact, they gained share, and the Big Three auto makers lost some. 
 Last year demonstrated how fiercely -- and adroitly -- the Japanese auto companies will fight to retain American customers against tough odds. The Japanese auto makers were more vulnerable than they had been in years. The yen strengthened against the dollar to record levels last year, making it far more costly to import cars from Japan. And Japan's economy continued to sag, making it difficult for its car makers to use profits at home to subsidize their operations here.
But they kept bringing buyers into their showrooms, by holding down price increases on popular models, emphasizing lease deals, shifting more production to the United States and introducing new, appealing cars and trucks.
"Anyone who underestimates the Japanese is in big, big trouble," said Robert J. Eaton, chairman and chief executive of the Chrysler Corporation.
The Big Three will probably pick up some market share in 1995, as they increase production of their new import fighters. But the sales results announced by the auto makers today show how hard it will be for Detroit to reclaim a substantial part of the market after years of neglect.
A year ago, few in Detroit would have expected the Japanese to hold their position in the short term, given the currency exchange rate. "If I had predicted a year ago that the dollar would be at 100 yen and that the Japanese would have gained market share in the interim, you would have wondered what I was smoking," said Joel Pitcoff, market analysis manager at the Ford Motor Company.
In a business where a tenth of a point of market share is contested like Helen of Troy, the Japanese companies gained two-tenths of a point to finish the year with 23.3 percent of the car and light-truck market. In reporting sales today for December and the entire year, the Big Three said they lost seven-tenths of a point to finish with 73.2 percent. Every tenth of a point this year represented 15,000 sales -- as many cars as Jaguar sold in the United States and more sales than Land Rover had.
Not that the Big Three turned in a shabby performance. Chrysler had the most profitable year in its 69-year history, and sold more vehicles than it ever had. Ford sold the most trucks in its history, as did General Motors' important Chevrolet division.
Ford finished the year with five of the eight best-selling vehicles in the United States. And Chrysler, once the industry's basket case, is widely believed to have become the world's most profitable auto maker. During 1994, it fully financed its pension plan for the first time since 1957, and is paying bonuses to its hourly workers averaging two months' pay, or almost $7,500.
On top of that, Chrysler finished the year with more than $7.5 billion in cash -- enough, Mr. Eaton said, to weather the next market downturn.
Over all, sales of cars and light trucks -- a surging category that includes pickups, mini-vans, four-wheel drives and sport utility vehicles -- grew to 15.1 million, up 8.4 percent from less from 14 million in 1993.
"It was a good year, no question about it," said John F. Smith Jr., president and chief executive of G.M., the world's largest auto maker. Like his competitors, foreign and domestic, Mr. Smith predicted continued growth in 1995, barring a sharp increase in interest rates.
The domestic auto makers, Mr. Smith noted, could not produce enough of certain cars and trucks to keep up with demand, probably sacrificing some sales to the Japanese.
At G.M., for example, long factory shutdowns to prepare for some new models deprived dealers of crucial products. It had no Chevrolet Lumina family sedans to sell for months, and still cannot make enough subcompact Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire cars to satisfy demand. "The market was stronger than we had anticipated," Mr. Smith said.
In addition, the Big Three argue that Japanese prices do not reflect the full impact of the strong yen, suggesting that the auto makers are taking losses on many American sales. "The strengthening of the yen has not been passed on to the U.S. market," Alexander J. Trotman, chairman and chief executive of Ford, said. "Some has, but not much."
Further, the Japanese performance was not uniform. The Toyota Motor Corporation, for example, actually lost some share in 1994, about a fifth of a percentage point, to 7.2 percent. But its sales still grew, with the Toyota division selling more than a million cars and trucks for the first time since 1986. Toyota, Japan's leading auto manufacturer, also sold a record number of its Camry family sedans, which are priced well above their Big Three competitors.
"Last year was proof-positive that a setback can become a springboard," said Dave Illingworth, senior vice president and general manager of the Toyota division in the United States. He added that he had begun seeing headlines describing Toyota's comeback.
"The question to be asked is, back from where?" he asked. "Because as far as Toyota is concerned, we never left."
To offset the strength of the yen, Toyota is increasing its production in North America. Mr. Illingworth said Toyota intended to raise North American production from 500,000 in 1994 to 790,000 units in 1996 and 900,000 in 1998.
And Toyota, like other Japanese companies, is vigorously cutting costs.
Mr. Eaton of Chrysler said, "I believe Toyota will reach their goal of being profitable at 80 or 90 yen to the dollar in the long term."
In the meantime, the Japanese showed in 1994 that to prevent the Big Three from exploiting their vulnerability they will take significant risks, like pushing leasing, a popular but financially risky marketing tool. "The Japanese have performed exceptionally well," said Susan Jacobs, president of Jacobs & Associates, an automotive marketing firm in Rutherford, N.J.
As the Big Three increase their production capacity, they will take some share back in the next two years, Ms. Jacobs predicted. But, she added, "After 1996, I think the Big Three will hold share at best, and maybe lose share."
The European auto makers gained ground in 1994, although they remain relatively minor players in the United States. They finished the year with about 2.6 percent of the market, up four-tenths of a point. South Korean manufacturers accounted for the remaining share, about nine-tenths of a percent.
Some customers have shown that they are not quite willing to take a chance on cars from Detroit's auto makers. Dan Chiles of Springfield, Mo., considered buying a new compact sedan, the Chrysler Cirrus. But he had bought three Hondas in the past, and because he said he felt safer with that company, decided on a Honda Accord instead.
"It's so stable and so well made that what I'm buying is an investment over time," Mr. Chiles said. "It will run great and have great resale value."
But Mr. Chiles said he made his choice also because he would have had to wait six to eight weeks for the Cirrus, suggesting that Chrysler may win more customers when the cars are more widely available. Robert A. Lutz, president of Chrysler, said that 80 percent of the people ordering the Cirrus were "trading in a late-model import, or on their way to buy an import, and we caught them at the last moment."
In fact, Earl J. Hesterberg, vice president and general manager of the Nissan division of the Nissan Motor Company, predicted that the new Chrysler compact sedans, as well as the new Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique compacts, would probably bite into the heart of Japan's market in the United States, drawing some customers away.
Then, he said, the Big Three may begin to regain some market share. "If it is going to happen -- which we should expect -- this would be the time," he said.

HEADLINE: Moscow, Bowing to I.M.F., Will Loosen Controls on Oil Prices

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 5

 BODY:
In a decision that could hasten needed loans to Russia, the Government has bowed halfway to foreign pressure and agreed to start liberalizing the domestic oil market.
A decree, signed by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin but not yet published, eliminates the requirement that oil companies sell more than half their production at artificially depressed domestic prices, World Bank officials said. The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United States all lobbied vigorously for such a step. 
 For ordinary Russians, the decision will mean gradually higher costs for energy because domestic prices are only 30 percent of world levels. But it was good news for the I.M.F. and the World Bank, which had said the elimination of quotas would be a crucial factor in their decision to provide Moscow the $13 billion in hard-currency loans that Russia is counting on for the 1995 budget.
The decision was sudden. "That's a big change from last week, and even two days ago," said Charles R. Blitzer, chief economist for the World Bank here. While not a total victory for economic reformers in the Cabinet, he said, "it's a good sign, a move generally in the right direction."
A Western diplomat said, "Frankly it's the first really good economic news in months."
But some of the bad news is pretty sobering, especially the drain of the unfinished offensive in Chechnya, the secessionist region in southern Russia. That operation is expected to cost $2.8 billion to $5.5 billion -- between 1 percent and 2 percent of the gross national product -- and is nowhere accounted for in the draft 1995 budget.
And the rise in prices in December was 16.4 percent, the highest monthly figure since last January. Every monthly inflation figure in the last quarter was in double digits.
Fears of new inflation also drove the ruble down today, to 3,623 to the dollar, the lowest rate since the ruble crashed suddenly in October.
The draft 1995 budget is tightly drawn on the premise that monthly inflation will fall to about 3 percent and the deficit will be about 8 percent of gross national product. That gap was already too high for the I.M.F., and did not include the Chechnya operation nor any funds the military may get for much-needed reorganization and training.
A former Prime Minister, Yegor T. Gaidar, has warned that the new spending might produce hyperinflation, a run on the ruble and even Government rationing.
There are also deepening worries abroad about the new Privatization Minister, Vladimir Polevanov, who said recently that he wants to re-nationalize some "strategic" industries, including aluminum, which is currently a glut on world markets.
He is opposed by the former Privatization Minister, Anatoly B. Chubais, who outranks him now as First Deputy Prime Minister, but he has support from more nationalist voices in the Cabinet. Mr. Polevanov is also said to be eager to expel American-funded advisers on privatization from Government offices.
Privatization seems to have been one of the great successes of Russia's economic reform, and Mr. Chubais remains one of the few strong reformers in the Cabinet. His influence was also important on the oil decision, Mr. Blitzer of the World Bank said. But if Mr. Polevanov begins to roll back on privatization, foreign investment will flee and the fledgling stock market will be hurt badly.
The abandonment of oil sales quotas, which the Government had promised would go into effect six months ago, will begin to move the industry away from state planning. It should also provide more tax revenue and more profit to domestic oil companies, which say they do not have enough money to refit aging pipelines or to dig new wells.
In large part because of such handicaps, oil production dropped 11 percent last year, to 302 million tons, the Ministry for Fuel and Energy reported today.
With the changes, domestic oil prices are to rise gradually as tax structures change. By enforcing an export tax on oil of about $3.75 a barrel, the Russians should be able to insure a good domestic supply while bringing more revenue to the strapped state budget.
Under the current system, the Government requires producers to sell up to 65 percent of their oil in the home market. Justification was offered on nationalistic grounds, but the system also kept bureaucratic control over the companies that were permitted to export oil. That created a large potential for corruption and favor-seeking.
But even the new decree reportedly retains the principle of exporting through specific companies, currently about 14 of them, which must be approved by the Government. So the issues of bureaucratic favoritism and potential corruption remain.
Foreign diplomats and bankers suggest that the Government will likely use its willingness to free the domestic oil market to argue for more indulgence on the budget from the I.M.F. That is also apparently an argument that Prime Minister Chernomyrdin used to beat back strong nationalist pressure to keep the quotas, pressure led by a bizarre intervention from Mr. Yeltsin's security chief, Maj. Gen. Aleksandr V. Korzhakov.
General Korzhakov, in a letter to Mr. Chernomyrdin, warned that ending the sales quotas would be "absolutely impermissible" because it would provide foreigners and their capital too much influence over Russian raw materials.

HEADLINE: Kiev Journal;
Out of Ukraine's Torment, a Jewish Flowering

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine

 BODY:
Yaakov Bleich, a 30-year-old Orthodox rabbi who came here from Brooklyn five years ago, might be expected to encourage the Jews in this city to emigrate from their birthplace, a land with a history of centuries of anti-Semitic persecution.
"When I came, I said get them out of here as quickly as possible," Rabbi Bleich said. "But I've modified my aim." 
 The major reason, he said, is that it is now possible to lead a religious life in Ukraine these days.
By any measure, there has been a lively revival of Judaism since Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The Jewish day school in Kiev has grown from 40 students three years ago to 600, and the rabbi says this makes it the largest Jewish school in Eastern Europe. There are 11 other Jewish schools across the country. Fifty synagogues are open, compared with 12 in 1990.
"At Passover we sold 120 tons of matzoh -- five years ago it was five times less," the rabbi said as he fielded a phone call about whether a brand of imported breakfast cereal was kosher.
The official attitude toward religion in general has warmed in Ukraine -- the Ukrainian Orthodox Church has undergone a renaissance -- and the Government has gone out of its way to emphasize reconciliation with Jews. Rabbi Bleich was invited by President Leonid D. Kuchma to travel on his plane on Mr. Kuchma's official visit to Washington in November. The rabbi went ahead separately, but the two men appeared together at a reception for prominent Jews that was held by the Ukrainian Government at its New York consulate.
Mr. Kuchma went one step further by visiting the Holocaust Museum in Washington, making up for what many felt was a snub by Leonid M. Kravchuk, who failed to attend the opening last year when he was President. During his visit to the museum Mr. Kuchma handed over a new list of 400 "righteous Gentiles" who protected Ukrainian Jews during World War II, a gesture that some here see as particularly important.
"Jews here, and American Jews, always remember the Ukrainians who collaborated with the Nazis," Rabbi Bleich said. "I think there were from 100,000 to 200,000 who collaborated. Of a population of 32 million at the time I think it's a small percentage."
Despite the changes in the last five years, anti-Semitism remains an undercurrent that often erupts in public. Three members of a far-right nationalist group, Una-Unso, were elected to Parliament this year. At their demonstrations in Lviv, members of the group shout anti-Semitic slogans. Far-right newspapers are filled with anti-Semitic articles. There have been a spate of muggings of elderly Jews in Lviv and Kiev.
About 70,000 Jews have left Ukraine in the last five years, mostly for Israel but also for the United States. A number of them were young scientists, seeking economic security but also more freedom from the stultified academic atmosphere here. In a speech in New York, Mr. Kuchma stressed that Ukraine respected the rights of Jews to emigrate but at the same time expressed sorrow over the departures.
The Jewish establishment here estimates that there are 550,000 Jews in Ukraine. Most of them are over the age of 40 and a high percentage are elderly and house-bound. At the turn of the century there were three million Jews in Ukraine. About a million left after a series of pogroms. In 1941, at Babi Yar in the outskirts of Kiev, more than 200,000 people, most of them Jews, were killed by Nazis; an estimated 500,000 Ukrainian Jews died in Nazi camps.
At the Jewish day school, the hallways are decorated with paper cut-out Hanukkah candles and maps of Israel and Hebrew script on the blackboards. A drawing of a yellow sun hung in one classroom with the inscription in Ukrainian, "I'm Very Happy Because I Am Jewish."
For many students, Judaism is something entirely new. "The first time I wrote on a blackboard the girls were so quiet I thought they had gone home," said Miriam Eckstein, 26, a Hebrew teacher from Israel. "It's new to them and they're very very interested."
Becoming knowledgeable about their religion is also new for some of the teachers. Svetlana Zivshytz, who worked for 20 years at a state school, now carries a book about Jewish holidays in her pocketbook.
"My parents were not very religious, but now my own faith is being revived," she said. "My child Yuri, who is 3 1/2, knows now there is such a thing as a Jewish holiday. He made a small purse, hung it around his neck and said mother and father should put something in it for Hanukkah."
Such sentiments have moved Rabbi Bleich to be less emphatic about emigration.
"The Israelis," he said, "get upset when I say, 'Don't leave.' But I say I'm a democrat and one of the basic rights is a person should live where he wants to live. My job is to teach Jews how to be Jewish."

HEADLINE: With Copter Pilot's Return, U.S. Will Send Oil to North Korea

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Less than a week after North Korea's release of a downed American helicopter pilot, the Department of Defense said today that it would begin shipments of oil to the country as part of a deal that is designed to end the North's nuclear weapons program.
That the Pentagon is paying $4.7 million to buy and ship the first 13.5 million gallons of oil to North Korea has angered many Republicans, who have charged that the Clinton Administration is propping up a rogue Government. 
 The accord requires North Korea to freeze and ultimately to dismantle its weapons-grade nuclear program in exchange for $4 billion in economic aid from the United States, Japan and South Korea.
Seeking to blunt Congressional opposition, a senior Defense Department official told reporters today that the Administration was satisfied that North Korea was complying with its commitment to open its existing nuclear complexes to inspection and to store and eventually ship its spent fuel rods, which could be used to make weapons, out of the country.
If that compliance ends, the official said at a briefing, the United States and its allies will halt the shipments of heating oil and ultimately abandon a plan to build two major reactors for North Korea that cannot produce weapons-grade fuel.
The Pentagon official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Administration chose to negotiate with North Korea last year rather than risk war. Tensions between the two countries reached a critical point last June when the United States threatened to seek international economic sanctions against the North.
Because the North said it would view sanctions as an act of war, the official said, the United States also took steps to increase the combat readiness and power of American and South Korean forces on the Korean peninsula.
"It is safe to say that it is the closest we have come to facing a major military confrontation, possibly with the exception" of the recent deployment of American troops to Kuwait to counter an Iraqi troop buildup, the senior Pentagon official said. "We faced a real possibility of military operations."
Although North Korea later acceded to the nuclear accord, Pentagon officials acknowledged that they have little insight as to who is actually running the country.
North Korea's new leader, Kim Jong Il, has made few public appearances since his father and predecessor, Kim Il Sung, died last July. The country's official Communist Party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, reported this week that villagers were searching for wild ginseng to help cure Mr. Kim, who has been rumored to suffer from diabetes, kidney or liver problems.
North Korea's delay last month in returning Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall, the pilot whose helicopter was shot down after straying into the North's territory, threatened to imperil the nuclear accord.
Mr. Hall confirmed today that his captors coerced him into signing a six-page statement conceding the flight was an "illegal intrusion." Interviewed on the television program "CBS This Morning," he said the statement was "what they dictated me to write down."
Pentagon officials said that merchant ships would deliver the heating oil -- the first of three shipments over the next 22 months -- to North Korea before Jan. 21.

HEADLINE: Panel on Labor to Urge Changes Aiding Unions and Employers

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
A special commission formed to develop labor policy for the Clinton Administration will recommend that Congress change the nation's labor laws so workers can organize unions more easily and employers will have more freedom to enlist workers and managers in committees that deal with workplace issues.
The recommendations, disclosed in interviews with commission members, drew cautious responses, even from the Administration. A Labor Department spokeswoman said there would be no comment before the release of the report, which is scheduled for Monday. A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials also withheld formal comment, but union leaders privately expressed disappointment. 
 Moreover, there is little support for labor in the new Republican-controlled Congress, which is likely to be a burial ground for any new legislation affecting worker rights.
"In the current political climate, it is highly unlikely that Congress would consider any recommendations to enhance union organizing," said Dan Yager, assistant general counsel of the Labor Policy Association, a business organization that lobbies Congress on labor issues.
Conflicts over union organizing are greater today than in the past and have become the major source of hostility between labor and management, the commission said in a preliminary "fact finding" report issued last May. To remedy this, it would have Congress change laws that might help reverse the decline in union membership over the last 20 years.
The 10-member panel, headed by John T. Dunlop, Labor Secretary in the Ford Administration, sought to balance the demands of employers and workers, members said.
To help labor, the commission would require the National Labor Relations Board to act much more quickly when workers say they were unlawfully dismissed for trying to organize unions at their companies. It would also have Congress establish a dispute mechanism, including perhaps binding arbitration, in cases where a newly elected union cannot negotiate a first contract.
Most important, the commission proposed ways to speed elections in which workers vote on whether to be represented by unions. That vote would have to be held two weeks after the National Labor Relations Board certified that the employees wanted such an election. Now, these elections are frequently delayed by management challenges.
"The main problem that concerned us was that these union elections were wars," said Richard B. Freeman, a labor economist at Harvard University and a commission member. "They go on for months, and they are a nasty business, and we wanted to stop this."
Union leaders consider the commission's recommendations inadequate. Instead of elections, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. had wanted the commission to favor making a union the automatic representative of a company's workers once a majority signed cards requesting this.
In the area of worker-management committees, the commission said these committees could deal "incidentally" with wages, work schedules and similar subjects as part of a broader effort to improve the workplace. That would ease, but not abolish, the current prohibition in the National Labor Relations Act, which says that bringing such subjects under committees that have been set up by management turns them into illegal sham unions.
By modifying the restriction, the commission tried to respond to what it saw as a growing demand among workers as well as employers for workplace committees.

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: FOR THE RECORD;
New House Rules

 BODY:
In its first session, on Wednesday and into early yesterday morning, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives adopted several changes in rules and procedures, all of which take effect immediately.
 
COMMITTEES -- Three standing committees -- District of Columbia, Merchant Marine and Fisheries, and Post Office and Civil Service -- and 25 subcommittees were eliminated. 

COMMITTEE STAFF -- A total of 622 staff positions were eliminated, for an estimated annual saving of $35 million.
 
LEGISLATIVE SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS -- Public financing of service organizations like the Congressional Black Caucus and the Arts Caucus was eliminated.
 
BUDGET -- A "truth in budgeting" measure was adopted, requiring lawmakers to compare spending proposals with current spending levels rather than with current levels plus estimated inflation. Republicans said the earlier practice had encouraged higher spending.
 
TERM LIMITS -- The Speaker's tenure was limited to four consecutive terms, and that of the chairman of any given committee or subcommittee to three consecutive terms.
 
OPEN MEETINGS -- All committee meetings and hearings will be open to the public "except in extraordinary circumstances." This "sunshine" resolution allows, as a right, broadcast coverage of any meeting or hearing open to the public.
 
TAXES -- A majority of three-fifths of the House will be required for passage of any bill that would increase personal or corporate income taxes. There will also be a ban on any measure or amendment that would provide a retroactive increase in the income tax rate.
 
HOUSE AUDIT -- A requirement for a comprehensive independent audit of House operations was adopted.
 
DELEGATES -- Delegates who represent the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and American territories will be prohibited from voting on the House floor, a privilege they were permitted for the last two years if their votes stood no chance of affecting the outcome.
 
COMMEMORATIONS -- A ban on commemorative legislation, for instance a measure declaring National Asparagus Day, was adopted.

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: THE OVERVIEW;
Quick Movement on a Broad Variety of Issues Before the House and Senate

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
As the 104th Congress began its second day in office, attention shifted to committees considering the legislative agenda Republicans have set for their party. The new Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, said he was determined to pass the legislation by mid-April.
 
The Budget
 Senators from both parties said today that Congress would soon approve a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget, even though there are profound uncertainties about how it would be enforced. 
 The Clinton Administration attacked the proposal, a central goal of the new Republican majority in Congress, saying it would worsen future recessions and create an avalanche of lawsuits by people trying to enforce or resist its spending limits.
Alice M. Rivlin, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said: "The deficit rises whenever the economy weakens. Such temporary increases in the deficit act as economic stabilizers." Without such stabilizers, she said, "we would have worse recessions." She asserted, "It would just exaggerate the boom-bust cycle if we had to balance the budget every year."
But at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Republicans and some Democrats said they found the Administration's arguments unconvincing. Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, said states with balanced budget amendments had not been inundated with lawsuits.
New estimates issued today by the Congressional Budget Office show the Federal budget deficit declining from $203 billion last year to $176 billion this year, then climbing to $284 billion in the year 2000 and $351 billion in 2003.
Most states already require balanced budgets at that level. But the prospects for ratification of the Federal proposal are unclear. A constitutional amendment takes effect only if ratified by legislatures in three-fourths of the states. A proposed amendment is not submitted to the President for approval or veto.
At the hearing today, Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel, said, "The proposed amendment fails to address the critical question of how it will be enforced." In the absence of such details, he said, "state and Federal judges may well be required to make fundamental decisions about taxing and spending in order to enforce the amendment."
Thus, he testified, "the balanced budget amendment threatens to take the power of the purse away from elected representatives of the people and put it in the hands of an unelected judiciary." And if the courts do not intervene, he said, the amendment could be just "an unenforceable promise."
The amendment might also shift power to the President. Ordinarily, the President must spend money appropriated by Congress. But Mr. Dellinger said that under the amendment, a President could take "whatever steps he deems reasonable and necessary" to achieve a balanced budget. These steps might include budget cuts, new fees and maybe even tax increases, with or without explicit authorization from Congress, he said.
Despite the Administration's arguments, the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said he supported the balanced budget amendment. Another Democrat, Mr. Simon, is a chief sponsor.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee, acknowledged there might be problems with enforcement. But he said Congress would never balance the budget "if we don't have some mechanism in the Constitution that requires us" to do so. And Senator Hank Brown, Republican of Colorado, said experience showed that "Congress isn't able to deal with the problem" by statute.
Ms. Rivlin said it was wrong for Congress to start "writing algebra into the Constitution." She said supporters of the amendment ought to specify how they would balance the budget. "What will be cut?" she asked. "Medicare? Social Security? Head Start? Food stamps? Road and bridge repair? National parks, homeless shelters? The American people have a right to know." ROBERT PEAR

HEADLINE: Challenges for Governor Rowland

 BODY:
There was good reason for the conciliatory tone in John Rowland's inaugural address as Governor of Connecticut. The first Republican governor in 20 years, he faces a split Legislature, with a solid Democratic majority in the House and a new but slim Republican majority in the Senate. Indeed, Democrats gained more House seats in Connecticut in the November elections than anywhere else in the country. If Mr. Rowland really means to repeal the state income tax -- his principal campaign promise -- he is going to need help.
Mr. Rowland heaped praise on his predecessor, the maverick independent Lowell Weicker, who defeated him in 1990. He promised compassion, "to help our young and old, our ill and afflicted, when they need help and have no other resources." And, attentive to urban deterioration in Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven as well as smaller cities, he implored "each and every civic-minded resident" of the state to help revive them. 
 But his biggest applause lines came straight from the campaign. He confirmed his pledge to phase out the personal income tax. He promised to use "our ultimate sanction" -- execution -- for murderers, even though Connecticut's death penalty has been in disuse for years and should stay that way. Finally, he promised to give local communities more control over their public schools and parents a greater say over where their children go to school.
There will be more detail next month in his State of the State address. But he has already made it clear he wants tax reduction to start this year.
Governor Weicker's outstanding achievement was enactment of an equitable income tax, ending the state's reliance on regressive and unstable sales tax collections. The income tax now provides more than one-quarter of the state's general revenue, and Mr. Rowland has yet to say how he intends to offset its loss -- which programs he would cut and which taxes might rise, either state or local.
With John Rowland and George Pataki of New York in place, and Pennsylvania soon to inaugurate Tom Ridge, the Governors of the biggest Northeastern industrial states will all be Republicans. Like the others, Governor Rowland promises to shrink his government. More than the others, he must cope with a pallid economy while trying to keep his budget in balance. This challenge may yet force him to rethink his pledge to do away with the income tax.

HEADLINE: Richer Than You Feel

 BODY:
Americans may feel battered by tough economic times, but by world standards they are doing just fine. The 400,000 residents of Luxembourg, says a survey by the World Bank, were the richest people on earth in 1993. Output per person, a rough proxy for income, averaged $29,510. Residents of the U.S. ranked second, averaging almost $25,000 each.
These figures take explicit account of price differences: a dollar of income in Luxembourg was calculated to buy approximately the same amount of goods and services as a dollar spent in the United States. 
 Nations ranked in the top ten produced at least $20,400 per person. They included industrialized countries (Canada and Japan), oil producers (Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) and Asian tigers (Hong Kong and Singapore). Western Europe accounted for ranks 11 through 20, except for rank 16, which went to Australia.
Mexico, a middle-income country, produced $7,000 per person. Russia produced only $5,000 per person -- about the same as Tunisia and Fiji. China produced even less, about $2,000 per person, still almost twice as much as Bangladesh and India. The bottom of the list is grim: Mozambique and Ethiopia produced $380 per person.
Living standards this low are appalling, especially since huge populations live on much less than the average. The bleak numbers should give pause to the new leadership in Congress that seems intent on cutting off the small amount of aid that the U.S. spends in Africa because it wastes taxpayer money.

HEADLINE: A Plausible Mexican Rescue Plan

 BODY:
President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, addressing shaken investors and anxious citizens, has proposed a coherent strategy to counter the plunging peso. The plan may not work as advertised; it could be improved. But it is probably good enough to return the economy, after a period of painful retrenchment, to prosperity.
Mexico has run large trade deficits that it has paid for with foreign loans. To keep loans flowing, Mexico offered investors high interest rates and a stable peso -- which Mexico sustained by buying excess pesos with dollars. When dollar reserves dwindled to alarming levels, Mexico was forced to let the peso float free. It plunged about 30 percent, driving up consumer prices overnight. 
 Mr. Zedillo's task was to balance Mexico's trade accounts. To that end, he proposed clamping down on wages and prices to stimulate exports; raising interest rates to retain foreign investors, and controlling government borrowing by cutting spending and selling state-owned enterprises.
These ideas are sound. Some are courageous. The spending cuts would exceed 1 percent of domestic output -- the equivalent of the U.S. Congress whacking about $70 billion out of the budget. Mr. Zedillo cajoled labor into accepting an 8 percent cut in wages after accounting for inflation. He persuaded companies to absorb some increased costs of production due to a fallen peso -- which drives up the price of imported equipment and raw materials.
But with austerity will also come slow growth, perhaps even recession. The plan makes these risks unnecessarily high. There is no obvious mechanism for enforcing the price guidelines; the wage restraints might not hold. If wages and prices take off, Mexico's exports will remain expensive and its trade imbalance will persist. And Mr. Zedillo did not overcome internal opposition to selling key parts of the state-owned oil monopoly, Pemex. Such sales could have generated billions of foreign reserves and lessened the need to raise foreign revenue by other, more punishing means: cutting spending, raising interest rates or driving the peso lower.
Despite the flaws, the Zedillo plan should be adequate, in large part because of an $18 billion stabilization fund paid for primarily by the U.S. with help from Canada and some international private banks. The size of the fund should reassure investors that their Mexican loans are safe -- and prevent the fears that undermined the peso from spreading elsewhere throughout Latin America.
The peso crisis has obscured an enduring Mexican achievement. Its market reforms have brought inflation under control, eliminated the federal deficit and initiated growth. These policies remain firmly in place -- in part because the Nafta trade accord with the U.S. and Canada prevents Mexico from backtracking. Mexicans will pay a price for their Government's tardy response to the trade imbalance. But Mr. Zedillo has now adopted a responsible plan that should eventually pave the way for recovery.

HEADLINE: If Pataki Really Rode With Teddy Roosevelt

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Teddy Roosevelt Along as Pataki Begins Ride" (news article, Jan. 1), describing the admiration of Gov. George E. Pataki of New York for the Republican Roosevelt, raises questions about Mr. Pataki's grasp of American political history. He may have been exposed to some of the country's finest scholars as an undergraduate at Yale, but he does not seem to have retained much of what they sought to teach him. 
 His reference to "anti-government Republicans, who were the Charles Sumner social Darwinists," confuses the Massachusetts Senator who struggled to gain political, social and economic equality for African-Americans in the Civil War era, and who recognized the necessity for positive government action to achieve this, with the Yale sociologist William Graham Sumner, whose "What Social Classes Owe to Each Other" (1883) argued that the state owed its citizens nothing but law, order and basic political rights.
Despite the Governor's rejection of this philosophy, should Mr. Pataki succeed in fulfilling his campaign promise to slash state spending, the citizens of New York may well find themselves operating within a Sumnerian framework of survival of the fittest.
Similarly, Governor Pataki's assertion that "the big government Wilsonian Democrats" favored creating "an agency to regulate something" is shaky on the facts. In seeking the White House in 1912, Woodrow Wilson associated himself with those whose aspirations and opportunities were thwarted by big business and its hirelings in Washington.
"The history of liberty is the history of the limitations of governmental power, not the increase of it," declared Wilson, the former president of Princeton. The realities of power would force him to modify his views and his policies, as they might for Governor Pataki, but in taking up the quest for social justice, Wilson was following the lead of none other than Theodore Roosevelt.
It was that Roosevelt who proclaimed in 1910 that "every man holds his property subject to the general right of the community to regulate its use to whatever degree the public welfare might require."
And it was Rosevelt's Progressive Party in 1912, with its support of more supervision of manufacturing and transportation corporations, of laws setting worker maximum hours and minimum wages, of an end to child labor and of creation of Government-run insurance and pension programs, that established the welfare state agenda achieved by Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon.
Of all the men who have occupied the White House in this century, none was a stronger advocate of a more powerful Federal Government than Theodore Roosevelt. For Governor Pataki to suggest that Theodore Roosevelt did not want "to regulate markets or people's lives in an ongoing way" is to turn the historical record upside down.
As Governor Pataki sits in his Hudson River Valley home reading biographies of Theodore Roosevelt, he should also glance at books about the Governor and President with the same last name whose family home lies 30 miles upstream. In Albany as well as in Washington, Franklin D. Roosevelt modeled himself after his distant cousin, with beneficial results for the state and the country.
The new Governor has chosen wisely in adopting Theodore Roosevelt as his idol, but Mr. Pataki can emulate his success only if he understands what both these Harvard men stood for.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Real Revolution

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL; Anthony Lewis is on vacation.

 BODY:
Special to the new Congress, here is a dispatch from the revolution.
In El Segundo, Calif., just before Christmas, Mattel Inc., the toy manufacturer, made some announcements. 
 Dividends would increase, stockholders would get a stock split 5 for 4, the company would have record high sales and earnings for the sixth year in a row, the balance sheet was strong and getting even better.
Also, the company would eliminate 1,000 jobs, about 4 percent of its work force.
There you have it. Multiplied by hundreds of American companies, affecting the lives of American workers and the middle class, diminishing old dreams and creating new fears, this kind of news adds up to the real American revolution of the 90's. It was moving fast through the country long before the election upheaval in November and will be around when the new members of Congress face their term limits.
Good show, say the analysts, way to go. No C.E.O. who intends to remain a C.E.O. has to be told the mantra: Increased production through mergers and the new technologies must lead to increased profit and decreased payrolls in a continuing cycle.
The deal most workers thought they had -- that their jobs would be safer and wages higher if things were good at the factory -- is over.
One day, if the nation is lucky, the Republican Congress may realize that its job is not simply to bring about a new revolution but to steer the revolution that was created for America in the new world market.
Felix Rohatyn, senior partner of Lazard Freres, believes that the work force will "cleave," creating an elite of 25 to 30 percent.
Mr. Rohatyn says that a huge transfer of wealth has occurred, moving from lower-skilled middle-class workers to the owners of capital assets and to a new technological aristocracy -- with a large element of compensation tied to stock values. He sees no solution to the technological-economic upheaval he thinks is the key problem of the country.
Another friend, who has created wealth for himself and jobs for thousands out of a kind of Mozartean business mind, is almost giddy with pleasure. He thinks the technological marketplace, a Republican victory, lower taxes and reduced government will liberate the private sector to produce jobs and joy. The man has been right before.
But not always. And meantime the non-elite, the 70 percent or so, become the foundering, searching, angry, anxious people. They will not be qualified to find decent jobs after they are personally downsized, work that fulfills their hopes as stakeholders in American society.
The working-middle class now take out their resentments on the very poor, very foreign or very Democratic. They will discover that will help them as much as aspirin helps a corpse. Neither welfare recipients, Mexican immigrants nor the local Democratic assemblyman have much to do with an economic-technological revolution that pushes hard-working people from the campfire.
Many of them could turn against a society that broke its deal and stuck a "loser" sticker on their foreheads. They may vote for demagogues who reject the society that has turned away from them.
There's no way to repeal the technological revolution. But there are ways to make sure it does not devour the working-middle class by destroying an expectation of job security in good times -- not too much to ask and too much to surrender.
That would need the cooperation of government and business. It would be needed to provide the training displaced workers need to equip them for decent jobs, something society has failed to do -- and to cut a trail for youngsters wandering so far from the campfire they have never felt its warmth. There might still be an elite, but not a working underclass marked "rejected."
Something important stands in the way -- the movement to make ideologies out of politics, to draw an almost theological line between conservative and liberal.
I wrote something hopeful about business not long ago. A reader from Oregon sent me the news from El Segundo to show you couldn't expect anything from American businessmen. But then he never met Felix Rohatyn or Mozart.

HEADLINE: Mexico Can Meet Its Debts, Finance Chief Tells Bankers

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
International investors seemed to increase confidence in Mexico's future yesterday as the country's new Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, told banking officials that his country could pay its debts.
In a whirlwind day in New York, Mr. Ortiz also sought to reassure investors by saying that Mexico would ask the International Monetary Fund for its stamp of approval on the economic-recovery plan it announced on Tuesday, after having devalued the peso in December. 
 Addressing a standing-room-only crowd in the ballroom of the Pierre Hotel yesterday morning, the American-educated Mr. Ortiz said Mexico now had $24 billion in new international credits and monetary reserves. They will be used, he said, to stabilize the peso and allow owners of $17 billion worth of foreign-held dollar-indexed treasury notes, known as tesobonos, to get their money out safely if they wished.
"We have a fundamentally sound economy," Mr. Ortiz said. "We do not have a solvency problem. We can pay our debts."
Objecting to comparisons with Mexico's bond default more than a decade ago, a development that ushered in a larger-scale Latin American foreign debt crisis, Mr. Ortiz declared, "The situation is completely different from what it was in 1982."
Describing the peso as "grossly undervalued," the Finance Minister said he expected to see it stabilize at about 4.50 to the dollar. But he emphasized that this was not a rate the Mexican central bank intended to defend by interventions in the currency markets.
Mr. Ortiz told the bankers that Mexico was working with leading New York investment banks and brokerage houses, including J. P. Morgan, Goldman, Sachs and Lehman Brothers, to create a series of longer-term, high-interest, dollar-indexed bonds that it would offer to foreign holders of the expiring short-term treasury notes.
Mr. Ortiz appeared to reassure most of the bankers present, who warmly applauded his two-hour presentation and the question-and-answer session.
John F. H. Purcell, director of emerging-markets research at Salomon Brothers, said an informal poll he took afterward showed that about two-thirds of those present were impressed by the Finance Minister's remarks and answers to questions.
"I see this as a turnaround point," Mr. Purcell said. "But it may take the market a while to believe it. Mr. Ortiz demonstrated that someone is in charge and that major political forces in the country are behind him."
To further strengthen confidence in the Government's economic program, Mr. Ortiz said he would visit the International Monetary Fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, in Washington today, not to ask him for more money but to win official support from the fund.
Mexico hopes to receive $14 billion in direct foreign investment, new bank loans and supplier credits this year. That should be sufficient, Mr. Ortiz insisted, to finance a current-account deficit the Government is committed to cutting by at least half -- to less than $14 billion.
Finally, the Finance Minister announced details of a plan to sell state-owned assets. The privatizations, expected to yield $12 billion to $14 billion, are to include part of the nation's electricity-generating monopoly as well as container ports, airports and satellite broadcasting and telecommunications rights. The oil industry remains out of bounds.
James Calmenares, a vice president at Morgan Stanley Asset Management, was also impressed by Mr. Ortiz's presentation. "It is very clear they are now dealing appropriately with the problem," he said.
On currency markets yesterday, the peso strengthened, rising in New York to close at 5.35 to the dollar, compared with 5.575 on Wednesday. The Mexico City stock market was up slightly, with the Bolsa index closing at 2,273.10, a gain of 0.14 percent. American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico declined slightly, closing down 12.5 cents at $38 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr. Ortiz's New York appearance was intended to clear away much of the confusion sowed by Mexico's bungled attempt last month at a 15 percent devaluation, which led in a day and a half to the Government's having to floating the peso instead.
Matters were only made worse by an unsuccessful attempt by then-Finance Minister Jaime Serra Puche to reassure American investors at a similar New York pep talk late last month. He resigned shortly afterward.
Mexico's new President, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, further damaged foreign confidence when he postponed his address to the nation on the crisis and then sketched in unsatisfying detail the measures his Government would take.
These include limits on wage increases to prevent the peso's fall from leading to an inflationary spiral, cuts in Government spending and a tighter monetary policy.
After the meeting yesterday at the Pierre Hotel, Mr. Ortiz held a smaller lunch with representatives of 10 major United States banks. Citibank's vice chairman, William R. Rhodes, who organized the lunch, said Mr. Ortiz gave "a forceful presentation, which impressed everyone with his realism as to what has to be done."
The Finance Minister also met yesterday with New York-based credit rating agencies and other big investors in Mexico.
Of $28 billion worth of tesobonos due to expire this year, Mr. Ortiz said $17 billion was owned by foreigners, mainly Americans. The remaining $11 billion is held by Mexican banks, which are expected to roll them over.
He gave no details of the new bonds he is planning to offer the foreign tesobono holders, except to say that they would have longer maturities and carry an attractive rate of interest. "We acknowledge that we will have to pay higher rates of interest than in the past," he said, adding, "We have to acknowledge the realities of the market."
Bankers say the Mexican central bank is likely to use some of the $24 billion stabilization package -- made up of $18 billion in new credits from the United States, Canada and the Bank for International Settlements, and $6 billion left in its reserves -- to support the peso during the turnover of the bonds, allowing investors to get their dollars back.
Mr. Ortiz said only that all the $24 billion "is available for intervention, but not for imprudent intervention."

HEADLINE: A Bankruptcy Peculiar to California

BYLINE: By SALLIE HOFMEISTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Here's one cutting-edge California phenomenon that is not likely to make it big elsewhere in the nation: the first major bankruptcy of a local government caused by taking risky bets with taxpayers' money.
The $2 billion investment loss that forced Orange County to declare bankruptcy in December can be traced largely to local recklessness in the face of fiscal and economic pressures that are peculiar to California. Indeed, while a number of municipalities around the country have been plagued by losses from financial derivatives gone bad, the worst troubles are concentrated in this state. Apart from Orange County, for instance, a recent nationwide survey of local governments found that six other California counties stood out as engaging in "significantly more aggressive" investment strategies than was typical. 
 "Orange County's problem is not a national problem," said Steven Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States in Albany. "Local governments across the country are strapped, but none has pursued such risky strategies to raise money because no state is as hemmed in by restrictions against raising taxes."
Those restrictions and California's own fiscal distress will also make digging out of the hole that much more difficult. Economists say that Orange County must now undergo a belt tightening it long avoided by relying so heavily on the profits from its investment pool.
"Orange County will do what it already should have, which is to cut services," said Esmail Adibi, director of the Center for Economic Research at Chapman University in the city of Orange.
Just last June, for instance, as employers like GM Hughes Electronics were drastically reducing their work forces in Orange County, the county government added 900 people to its payroll, largely to handle an increase in the welfare caseload. And it spent $1.5 million to acquire land near the John Wayne Airport to build an office building despite vast empty office space in the area left by the recession.
In fact, while the private sector in the county lost 55,000 jobs from 1990 through 1994, the local government and its districts, Mr. Adibi calculates, "managed to add 6,000 people to the payroll, paid for by bond financings and investment returns."
The roots of the problem that erupted with such fury in Orange County in December can be traced back to 1978. That's when California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 13, a citizen referendum that rolled back local property taxes to 1 percent of market value and limited increases to no more than 2 percent a year. It took other special circumstances, however, to put so many California counties in such difficult positions.
Shortly after Proposition 13 was adopted, the state government, bolstered by a fat surplus and a cornucopia of tax revenues received in the booming 80's, stepped in to keep local governments afloat by providing them with extra funds to carry out their duties. It also shouldered them with extra responsibilities. But when the state's economy slowed in the late 1980's and then plunged into recession, California's coffers ran dry. The obligations only increased.
Most local governments were squeezed between lower tax revenues and rising costs for education, health care and law enforcement. That pressure was intensified by a slew of additional state mandates and a continuing influx of immigrants, who put extra demands on government services. The state, in response, relaxed even further restrictions on investments so local treasurers could seek higher returns, despite the higher risks.
Robert L. Citron, the Orange County treasurer who resigned just before the county filed for bankruptcy, was a key author of the legislation allowing counties to borrow heavily and invest in riskier securities.
Orange County, while clearly the most daring, was not the only place in California to take advantage of the new freedom to speculate with taxpayer money. The risky investment practices that wreaked havoc in Orange County, Moody's Investors Service found, were also pursued actively in six other counties: San Diego, San Bernardino, Monterey, Placer, Solano and Sonoma. Only a scattering of places outside California were so aggressive.
After the bankruptcy, Moody's, a leading Wall Street credit-rating agency, surveyed 1,450 counties, cities, school districts and local agencies across the country. Orange County stood alone in the degree to which it took chancy interest rate bets, relied on borrowed money and allowed municipalities outside the county to join its pool, according to the bond rating agency. (Moody's has now vowed to alter its standards for judging municipal bonds after failing to detect Orange County's troubles in advance.)
"None has the characteristics of Orange County's pool," said David Brodsly, a vice president in Moody's San Francisco office.
But a few others deserve close attention. San Diego, for instance, whose $3.3 billion fund has dropped 11 percent in value, told investors in December that they would share in that loss if they tried to withdraw their money. The action was taken in a bid to prevent a run on its fund similar to the one that led to Orange County's bankruptcy.
Nor is Orange County the only one of California's 58 counties that is on the ropes. Verging on collapse, eight tiny counties asked the Legislature for a $15 million bailout package in the fall. They were turned down.
Merced County is negotiating with the state for $6 million in relief, while Butte received $11 million in the early 1990's, a loan that it has yet to pay back.
Perhaps the biggest blow to these communities came from the state's own hardship, and particularly, from a 1988 voter initiative, Proposition 98, that mandated specific levels of state spending on education. To fulfill that obligation, the state has largely drawn on county resources.
Over the last three fiscal years, according to Terry Brennand, a lobbyist for the California Association of County Treasurers, the state has redirected $4 billion in local property taxes to the schools. That has left counties with less money to pay for libraries, parks and other services not mandated by the state, shaving their discretionary spending, in some cases, to as little as 5 percent from an average 17 percent in the late 80's, according to Dan Wall, an official at the California State Association of Counties.
Some counties managed in part by increasing their reliance on the public markets for financing. Although California makes up about 12 percent of the national economy, it accounted for 16 percent, or $26 billion, of all long-term municipal bonds issued in 1994, according to the Securities Data Company. Merrill Lynch, the biggest municipal underwriter and deeply involved in Orange County's troubles, handled 37 percent of the business.
The squeeze also encouraged exotic local financings -- sale leasebacks, special tax assessments and fees -- that have made California's tax system among the most cumbersome in the country.
"We now have a system of government," said Jeffrey Chapman, a professor of public administration at the University of Southern California, "that is so arcane that only 15 people in the state understand it."
Counties also searched for bigger investment returns, with some following the lead of Mr. Citron, the treasurer of Orange County for more than two decades who emerged as something of a Pied Piper in the state because his investment returns were consistently higher than most municipal treasurers in the country.
But with the risks of Mr. Citron's strategies now abundantly clear, California is moving to tighten investment requirements on local governments. Curt Pringle, an Assemblyman from Garden Grove in Orange County, has introduced a bill that would limit borrowing to 10 percent of a county's portfolio, restrict the use of derivatives to 5 percent, and ban raising money from bonds strictly for investment. A similar measure is expected to be introduced soon in the State Senate, which held hearings in December on Orange County.
Still, municipal bond experts say the state government, by failing to play a more active role in repairing the damage in Orange County, could end up casting a long shadow over California's finances. Other cities on the verge of bankruptcy -- New York, Philadelphia and Cleveland among them -- relied heavily on their states to back bond offerings and other measures that helped overcome budget squeezes.
"In every other major credit crisis in government in the last 25 years, states have taken a lead role," said J. Chester Johnson, chairman of Government Finance Associates Inc., a financial adviser to state and local governments in New York. "There is an implied moral obligation of states to help their municipalities. Without the leadership and support of California in dealing with this bankruptcy, all state issues will continue to suffer in the market."

AT&T Seeks Stake in India's Phone Market

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Following other major American companies that have set their sights on India's potentially huge markets, the AT&T Corporation said today that it would seek a share in the $7.5 billion expansion of India's creaky telephone system.
"With a population of nearly 900 million people and less than one telephone for every 100 people, it's clearly one of the largest telecommunications markets in the world," said John Legere, a senior executive of AT&T Asia/Pacific Inc., at a news conference. 
 AT&T has teamed up in its bid with one of India's most powerful industrial giants, the Aditya V. Birla Group, a conglomerate with more than $4 billion in annual revenues. Together, the companies plan to bid for contracts to provide telephone services in several of the country's largest markets, including three key industrial states: Gujarat, Karnataka and Maharashtra.
India's telephone system has been widely regarded as a major obstacle to the country's economic modernization. Since India became independent in 1947, telephone services, like other key economic sectors, have been a Government monopoly. But the Government of Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao decided last year to introduce private competition.
The Telecommunications Ministry announced last week that on Jan. 16 it would invite bids for contracts to supply conventional telephone services in 20 zones that correspond roughly to the boundaries of India's 25 states. Bidders will also be invited to make offers for mobile phone services in 19 zones. The ministry said results of the bidding would be announced on March 31.
The Government plans to increase the number of telephones installed across India to 20 million by the end of the decade from 7.2 million at present, at an estimated cost of $7.5 billion. About half of the new phones will come from the telecommunications ministry and half from private companies.
In addition to AT&T, foreign companies that have shown interest in the new contracts include Alcatel Alsthom of France, Fujitsu of Japan and Siemens of Germany.
At the news conference, AT&T executives cited statistics that showed how India lagged behind other Asian nations in telephone service. They said that India currently had 0.8 telephone for every 100 people, compared with 1.7 telephones for every 100 Chinese, 2 for every 100 Pakistanis, and 13 for every 100 Malaysians.
In addition, Indian customers wait months and sometimes years to have phones installed, and fewer than 40 percent of all calls dialed are routed to the right number, compared with 99.9 percent in the United States.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Jumped 2.6% in November

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
American factories posted a sharp rise in new orders for November and shipped more finished products than in October, the Commerce Department said today in a report that showed the manufacturing sector was still expanding briskly.
Orders rose 2.6 percent, or $7.4 billion, in November to a seasonally adjusted $293.4 billion, following a decline of four-tenths of 1 percent in October orders. 
 It marked the eighth month in 1994 in which orders increased -- a show of industrial vigor likely to carry total 1994 orders to a level about 10 percent higher than in 1993.
Backlogs of unfilled orders kept growing, rising seven-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $453.9 billion in November after an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent in October. It was the third consecutive month in which order backlogs rose and suggested that factories have plenty of work on hand.
"This level of backlogs points to continued momentum in the factory sector," with only a few signs on the horizon of an expected 1995 slowing, said Lynn Reaser, an economist with First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles.
On Tuesday, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its latest survey indicated some steam might have gone out of business in December. Although still expanding, manufacturing was less vigorous than in November.
There were other indications, too, that rising interest rates may be about to slow the pace of economic expansion to around 2.9 percent this year from an expected 3.9 percent for all of 1994.
The Commerce Department said today that housing completions dropped 1.3 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million. In addition, the Labor Department reported a pickup in claims for unemployment insurance benefits last week to 335,000 from 321,000 in the week ended Dec. 24.
The resurgent United States economy created about three million new jobs in 1994 but most private economists say that will ease to about two million jobs this year -- still a generally healthy jobs outlook.
During November, manufacturing businesses were strong by any measure. Durable goods orders that account for about half of total factory business shot up 3.4 percent after falling eight-tenths of 1 percent in October. Most of that was accounted for by a 12.7 percent jump in orders for transportation goods, including new cars and airplanes and parts, after a 9.4 percent drop in October.
 Even excluding transportation, factory orders rose 1.2 percent in November following a 1 percent rise in October.

HEADLINE: Regulators See No Need for Tougher Rules on Derivatives

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Federal regulators and members of the Senate Banking Committee expressed little enthusiasm today for putting broad new controls on the derivatives market after the heavy losses in Orange County, Calif. But they said a few narrow regulatory changes might be needed.
The Acting Treasury Secretary, Frank N. Newman, led several financial regulators in telling the committee at a hearing today that he saw no current need for Congress to introduce broad rules covering derivatives, which are financial contracts that vary widely in value with interest rates, stock prices, currencies or commodity prices. The existing legislation provides adequate discretion to regulators, he said. 
 Taking a position similar to that of Wall Street derivatives dealers, Mr. Newman said Orange County ran into trouble not because of investments in derivatives but because of a flawed investment strategy. "It purchased long-term securities with short-term loans," he said, and lost money when short-term interest rates rose sharply last year.
The committee's new Republican majority showed little enthusiasm for imposing new rules on either the sale of derivatives by Wall Street firms or their purchase by municipalities.
"Frankly, I see few Federal issues that are raised by the Orange County bankruptcy," said Senator Lauch Faircloth, Republican of North Carolina. "We don't need more regulations, we need fewer."
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, also warned that it would be a mistake to impose tough new regulations on derivatives. He said the Fed's recent requirement that Bankers Trust in New York disclose more information to its customers using derivatives was an isolated decision and not indicative of any move toward more comprehensive regulation.
The broad hostility to regulating the derivatives market, however, did not extend to several narrower changes. The regulators and several senators expressed a strong interest in requiring municipalities and other buyers of derivatives to disclose more of the risks to credit rating agencies and the public.
And Mr. Newman reminded the senators that an interagency group was reviewing whether to impose rules that would define the way Wall Street went about selling a certain class of particularly risky derivatives known as structured notes.
Typically issued by Government-sponsored enterprises like the Federal National Mortgage Association, structured notes pay highly complicated interest rates. The interest earned on some of Orange County's structured notes, known as "inverse floaters," fell when interest rates rose nationwide.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development has also begun an inquiry into sales of structured notes by Government-sponsored enterprises.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Fall On Fears of Brisk Growth

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday amid investor concern about the employment report for December that is scheduled to be released this morning. Behind much of the selling was worry that the numbers would show brisk economic growth that could cause inflation to accelerate and interest rates to rise.
The 30-year bond fell 11/32 , to a price of 9521/32 for a yield of 7.88 percent, up from 7.85 percent on Wednesday. The long bond, by the close of the New York market, gave back about half of Wednesday's gain. 
 Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist and managing director at ASB Capital Management in Washington, said what worried bond traders and investors was not the overall jobs number, which some forecasters expect to show a gain of 260,000 in nonfarm payrolls. What they are more worried about, he said, is what what they find in the details.
Mr. Carpenter, whose firm has more than $9 billion under management, said he expected the average number of hours worked to rise three-tenths of a percent and because of that inflation worries would start building. He said the market would also be looking at the index of hours worked in the manufacturing sector, both for factory work as well as overtime.
"I expect both will be up from the prior month," he said, "reflecting a manufacturing sector that was humming toward the end of the year."
A stronger-than-expected report yesterday on factory orders for November added to the long list of monthly indicators that implied a healthy gain in fourth-quarter economic growth, and that weighed on market prices. Orders rose 2.6 percent in November after falling four-tenths of 1 percent in October. Economists had forecast a 2 percent rise in November.
"It really doesn't matter how you analyze the number, it was strong," Mr. Carpenter said. "Up until this point, the main strength in the manufacturing sector has derived primarily from the strength in durable goods orders. But this month, in addition to that strength, we also had a healthy 1.7 percent jump in nondurables." This suggested, he said, that the next round of factory order data would also be robust.
And with the fourth-quarter growth rate looking more like 5 percent, Mr. Carpenter said that strong momentum could be expected to carry over into the first quarter. He said he thought this growth would force the Federal Reserve to raise the Federal funds rate another three-quarters of a percentage point when its policy-making committee meets at the end of the month.
Elsewhere, housing completions were down 1.3 percent, to 1.347 million units. Jobless claims for the week ended Dec. 31 were up 14,000, to 335,000. Some forecasters had expected a small drop to 320,000. According to Kathleen Stephansen, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the level of claims for the week was the highest since July 16, when it was at 390,000.
In the municipal market, bonds were little changed. Expectations of a drop in bond issuance led some of yesterday's new sales to be priced above market levels. One of the day's largest deals was a double-A rated $107.9 million offering by the Texas A & M University Board of Regents won by Merrill Lynch. The serial bonds were priced at par to yield from 4.25 percent in 1995 to 6.40 percent in 2011 and 2012.
At yesterday's auction of new one-year bills the Treasury said the average rate rose 11 basis points from last month's auction, to 6.86 percent. That was the highest since Oct. 26, 1990, when it was 7.01 percent.
The following are the results of that auction:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines on Turmoil Over Spanish Interest Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against leading currencies yesterday as traders bought German marks as a haven from turmoil in Spanish financial markets.
The dollar was also weaker from profit taking after its rise against the Japanese yen on Wednesday. 
 The Bank of Spain raised its benchmark interest rate to 8 percent from 7.35 percent on Wednesday, prompting sharp declines in Spanish stocks and the peseta.
"People were buying marks for pesetas like crazy," said Vicki Schmelzer Alicea, vice president of currency sales at Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale in New York.
The flight to marks, Europe's strongest currency, weakened the dollar because traders buying marks for Spanish pesetas often execute the transaction by buying dollars for pesetas, then selling the dollars for marks. The mark neared its record high against the peseta, rising to 85.51 pesetas, from 85.04 on Wednesday. The mark reached a record of 85.87 pesetas on Dec. 28.
While higher interest rates tend to bolster a currency, the markets saw the increase by the Spanish central bank, its first since November 1992, as insufficient. Many currency dealers doubt that the Spanish Government will be able to bring inflation down to the target of 3.5 percent it set for the end of this year.
The Spanish markets will be closed today in observance of the Epiphany.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5510 marks from 1.5590 marks on Wednesday, and to 1.3005 Swiss francs from 1.3105 francs. The British pound rose to $1.5630 from $1.5605.
The dollar fell to 100.87 yen from 101.36 yen. Dollar sales by Japanese exporters helped drive up the yen, currency dealers said. The exporters sold yesterday to take advantage of the dollar's rise to a four-month high of 101.46 yen on Wednesday.
"Japanese exporters have been on holiday since before Christmas, and on their return from vacation they are finding much more attractive levels to lock in their dollar sales," said Jack Griffin, currency sales manager at Fuji Bank in New York.
Even so, dealers expect the dollar to rise in the coming sessions, bolstered by expectations of another increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve at the end of January.
The dollar could reach 1.58 marks and 102 yen this month, said Win Thin, currency analyst at MCM Currencywatch, a consulting firm.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Demand Lifts Price of Oil; African Drought Buoys Corn

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Commodities, led by gasoline, rose yesterday amid signs that demand for energy products might be unexpectedly strong this winter.
"U.S. gasoline demand will be stronger than previously thought," Morris Greenberg, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said. 
 Recent warm weather and consumer confidence have helped prop up gasoline sales during a season when driving typically slumps.
Elsewhere, crude oil prices rose, while corn and coffee prices gained after reports overseas that exports might be reduced this year. The Commodity Research Bureau index rose 0.62 point, to 235.84, well above its 12-month average.
American gasoline inventories were little changed last week, the American Petroleum Institute said yesterday. Supplies held steady even as refiners produced almost eight million barrels a day, close to the record set a month ago.
"The inventory report looked very constructive," Mr. Greenberg said. Despite high gasoline production, "stockpiles didn't build and it was the fourth consecutive week of strong delivery" to buyers by refiners, he said, adding, "There's no indication of a letup in demand."
Unleaded gasoline for February delivery rose 1.08 cents, to 54.51 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. February crude oil climbed 24 cents, to $17.72 a barrel. February heating oil gained 0.32 cent, to 49.96 cents a gallon.
Corn futures also rose in price. A drought in South Africa that has ravaged the country's crop could increase United States exports.
According to a United States agricultural attache report released this week from Pretoria, the South African capital, the drought could reduce the country's 1994-95 corn crop by 30 percent and its exports as much as 90 percent.
Corn for March delivery at the Chicago Board of Trade rose 2 cents to settle at $2.3075 a bushel.
Coffee futures prices rose as Central American producers met in El Salvador to work on a plan announced last month to withhold 20 percent of their exports from the market until coffee prices rose again. Colombia, a big South American producer, said it might adopt the plan.
March coffee futures rose 4.55 cents to settle at $1.7255 a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.

NEW YORK REGION'S ECONOMY SPUTTERS
 Economic expansion and job growth in the New York region have come to a virtual halt since July, and higher interest rates are further undermining the region's prospects, according to economists, executives and government officials. Although the New York region shows few signs of sinking back into recession, the experts say the local economy remains one of the weakest in the nation, when business activity elsewhere is so robust that the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since February to ward off inflation. A1.
 
SECURITY AT MENTAL HOSPITALS CRITICIZED
 The state's top mental health official said that the man accused of pushing a woman to her death under a subway train should not have have had the freedom to walk away from a mental hospital and that the state needed to improve the security at its mental institutions. Dr. Bruce Feig, the executive deputy commissioner of mental health, said the suspect, Reuben Harris, should have been classified as dangerous -- a designation that would have required tighter control of his movements. A1.
 For more than 24 hours, La Chang Soon did not know of her daughter's fate. Her own health failing, the 93-year-old woman was told that her daughter had been hospitalized after falling ill. But as time wore on, the truth could no longer be hidden. B4.
 First came a firebomb that injured more than 40 people. Then an escaped mental patient shoved a grandmother from a subway platform, killing her. Despite the assurances of the Metropolitan Transit Authority's advertising campaign that the city's subways are safer, many riders said they had had more than enough. B4.

 New Yorkers would pay more for subway tokens, school lunches and even water under the Republicans' "Contract With America," according to a study released by Representative Charles E. Schumer. He said the legislation would also cost the city $1.9 billion in Federal aid next year. B2.

HEADLINE: Budget Director Quits to Take State Senate Job, Forcing Giuliani to Juggle Staff

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's budget director resigned yesterday, forcing the Mayor to juggle his senior fiscal staff as the city faces mounting financial problems this fiscal year and a looming $2 billion deficit next year.
The budget director, Abraham M. Lackman, who was a major architect of Mr. Giuliani's strategy to reduce spending and cut the size of the municipal work force, will return to his home in Albany to become the top fiscal aide to the Republican-controlled State Senate and a special adviser to Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader. Mr. Lackman had held a lower-level fiscal position in the Senate before coming to City Hall. 
 With his preliminary plan for the 1996 fiscal year due in just a month, Mr. Giuliani immediately tapped his Finance Commissioner, Marc V. Shaw, 40, to move into the budget director's post. Mr. Shaw had worked closely with Mr. Lackman and was previously the chief fiscal aide to the City Council.
Mr. Giuliani announced the departure of Mr. Lackman just a day after telling council officials and the Comptroller that the city's fiscal position was worsening once again, this time because tax revenues were coming in below expectations. Senior aides, some of them appearing stunned, stood by as Mr. Giuliani late yesterday said that he had learned of Mr. Lackman's decision only that morning. Mr. Lackman was at a hearing at the Transit Authority, and returned to City Hall only an hour after the Mayor left.
Mr. Giuliani said he had anticipated that Mr. Lackman might be interested in returning to Albany, where his wife and a teen-age son still live. He praised Mr. Lackman as someone who "helped to turn the city around." He also expressed hope that Mr. Lackman would prove a crucial ally in Albany where he will be a key figure in negotiating the budget.
"I think he will also be very valuable to the city of New York because we will have someone in a critical position in Albany who understands in depth the real issues that face the city and the state," he said.
Mr. Shaw, who has been a close friend of Mr. Lackman for years, takes over as budget director at a time when the city faces persistent fiscal problems and difficult political choices.
Just this week, administration officials acknowledged that tax revenues for the end of 1994 had dropped at least $200 million more than they had expected because of a downturn on Wall Street. That could leave the city with a gap as high as $500 million before the fiscal year ends in June.
Further complicating the Mayor's efforts to balance the budget, a Federal judge this week ordered the city to suspend budget cuts in the agency that administers welfare benefits until it can prove the reductions will not affect aid for the poorest New Yorkers.
In addition, the city still faces a potential deficit of $2 billion next year, despite a year of deep budget cuts and the elimination of 14,000 jobs. Mr. Lackman had already begun planning for a budget that would tackle the problem in large part by cutting $1.2 billion from health and welfare grant programs for the poor. The move would mark a sharp departure from the city's tradition of sometimes unparalleled generosity toward the needy, but Mr. Lackman has said it would put New York City on the same course as Albany and Washington.
While aides to Mr. Giuliani acknowledged that Mr. Lackman's departure, which is slated for the end of the month, comes at a difficult time, they said Mr. Shaw had attended every meeting on fiscal policy and was well positioned to take over. "He's been a full partner in virtually every single decision we've made with regard to the economy, budget, the budget decisions for the city," Mr. Giuliani said.
A major fiscal question facing the Giuliani administration is how Mr. Bruno and Gov. George E. Pataki, who faces a $5 billion gap in the state budget and who is committed to cutting taxes, will view aid to New York City. Both Republicans have had a strained relationship with the Mayor because of his decision last fall to cross party lines and campaign for Democratic Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. Mr. Bruno, a Pataki ally who toppled Ralph J. Marino to become majority leader after the election, had at one point referred to the Mayor as "Judas Giuliani."
Although Mr. Lackman's name had surfaced in recent months as a possible contender to be Mr. Pataki's budget director, aides to the new Governor said he had never seriously been considered for the post, largely because of Mr. Pataki's adversarial relationship with Mr. Giuliani. But Mr. Lackman, 46, had many fans in the Senate where he had been director of fiscal affairs for the Senate Finance Committee before he was recruited by Mr. Giuliani.
"I think he's one of the best," Mr. Bruno said. "He has a wealth of experience, a wealth of knowledge about government operations."
Mr. Lackman, who earned $110,000 as budget director, will be paid $99,000 in his new job, where his titles will be secretary to the Senate Finance Committee and Special Adviser to the Majority Leader.
Mr. Bruno said that he was reducing the salary of the post from its current level of $104,000 as part of cost-saving measures he has imposed since his nomination as majority leader in November. Mr. Bruno also said that the compensation for the job would no longer include a car.
Mr. Lackman dismissed the salary cut last night, saying, "Money has never been an issue for me." He said the main reason for his departure was the strain his job had put on his wife, Jeanne, and son Aaron, 16, who had remained in the Albany suburbs while Mr. Lackman moved in with in-laws in Brooklyn. He said that because of the demands of the budget director post, he had only been able to visit them once a month.
"The job puts a lot of pressure -- and it's a pressure other people face as well -- on families," he said.

Chronology: "Tracking
 
JULY: The 1995 fiscal year begins after the Mayor and the Council agree on more than $1 billion oncuts and other actions to close a potential gap of $2.3 billion in a $31.6 billion budget.
 
OCTOBER: After tax revenues fall and anticipated Federal and state aid fails to materialize over the summer, the Mayor proposes a second round of cuts to close a new gap of $1.1 billion that has opened in the budget.
 
NOVEMBER: Unable to reach an agreement with the Mayor on cuts to educations, youth services and social programs, the City Council passes its own version of budget cuts, restoring $96 million in spending in some areas and replacing it with equal cuts in other agencies. Mr. Giuliani vetoes the Council's plan, calling it "blatantly illegal."
 
DECEMBER: With Mr. Giuliani saying he will ignore the override of his veto, the City Council sues the Mayor for the first time since it was created in 1938. A state judge throws out both the Mayor's plan and the Council's version. As the year ends, theMayor announces that he will unilaterally impose $800 million in spending cuts to keep the budget balanced.
 
JANUARY: Officials acknowledge that the city still faces a budget gap of $500 million or more for the fiscal year that ends in June because tax revenues fell further than expected in the wake of a downturn on Wall Street. The size of the budget gap for the next fiscal year has gorwn to $2 billion. With cuts in state aid virtuallycertain because the state faces a $5 billion gap and a Governor committed to cutting taxes, the gap could grow even larger, forcing still more cuts in services.

HEADLINE: Rail Death: Mother, 93, Says 'Why?'

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
For more than 24 hours, La Chang Soon did not know of her daughter's fate. Her own health failing, the 93-year-old woman was told that her daughter had been hospitalized after falling ill.
But as time wore on, the truth could no longer be hidden. Yesterday the sobs of a grieving mother filled the family's small Brooklyn apartment as a steady stream of visitors offered condolences and prayers. 
 The woman's daughter, Soon Sin, herself a mother of three and grandmother of six, died on Wednesday beneath the wheels of a roaring subway train. A mentally ill homeless man had pushed her onto the tracks as she waited for a train at Herald Square, the police said. Legions of commuters watched as a lone man held the suspect in a bear hug until the police arrived.
"Why? Why? Why?" the mother cried in Korean, her native tongue, as friends and family tried to console her. "She was so good and kind. Why was my girl killed like that?"
In the well-maintained, working-class apartment building on Marine Avenue in Bay Ridge, where Soon Sin had lived with her family for more than 10 years, neighbors yesterday lamented the death of a woman whom their children called Grandma. They told of how she spoke halting English but would communicate with a smile and gifts of fresh fruit, of how she always encouraged them to go to church.
They gathered in the living room that had served as a bedroom for Mrs. Sin, 63, and her husband, Kang Sik Sin, 65, who had shared the tiny fourth-floor apartment with her elderly mother.
Mr. Sin sat stoically on a sofa, under a framed passage of Scripture written in Korean. He was surrounded by his three grown sons, who were dressed in black suits and white shirts. Sadness showed in their eyes even though no tears were shed. The women in the room did not try to hide their grief, and their wailing could be heard throughout the building's hallways.
The family, almost all their words spoken in Korean, sat and tried to understand sudden death in New York City, and how its victims are chosen.
"We weren't going to tell Grandmother at first, because we didn't want to have two funerals," said Chong Ho Sin, 41, the couple's oldest son, who is married and lives on Staten Island. "But we had to tell her because we could not explain all of the visitors."
Mrs. Sin came to the United States with her husband and three sons from Chongju, South Korea, in 1978, seeking economic opportunity and a better education for the children.
"She lived for us, my father, the church and helping people," said her son David Shin, 37, an accountant who lives in Hempstead, L.I. "Even in Korea, she was active in the church. She was always praying.
"My mom was not a woman of great intellect and knowledge," added Mr. Shin, who has changed the spelling of his surname. "But she always worked hard and she encouraged us to get a good education."
Today, all three sons are prospering. Besides David, an accountant, Chong Ho and Kum Ho, 39, own their own groceries on Staten Island.
But America was not as easy for the parents. Mrs. Sin's husband, a government employee in Korea, worked in the wholesale garment business in midtown Manhattan, importing hats, gloves and other items. Business eventually dried up and after a few years there was no more work. As for Mrs. Sin, who in Korea had owned and operated a motel, she had to work 12-hour days as a seamstress in the garment district.
After her retirement, in 1988, she dedicated her days to the United Korean Church, a Protestant church on Fourth Avenue and 76th Street in Bay Ridge, not far from her home. She made stockings that were distributed to disabled children at Christmas and cooked turkeys for the elderly at Thanksgiving.
Two months ago, one of her greatest dreams came true: She became a United States citizen after having failed the test twice before.
After a routine checkup at her doctor's office in Manhattan on Wednesday, she was headed for a Korean center for the elderly in Flushing to pick up educational material about her new citizenship and possibly look into a part-time job, said Chong Ho Sin, the oldest son.
Her son David said: "She was very glad about obtaining her citizenship. She went through a rough time and she finally made it. I think she would be angry at the man for taking her life away, but she was kindhearted enough to forgive him."
His father, speaking through a translator, said: "The only thing I want out of this case is that another person does not leave prison and not get the help he needs. Other families should not have to go through something like this."
He stared out the small window, the one that faces the concrete ramps leading to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge that soars beyond.
"It's terrible," he said. "Terrible."

HEADLINE: For Many Subway Riders, a Greater Feeling of Fear

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
First came a firebomb that injured more than 40 people two weeks ago. Then, on Wednesday, an escaped mental patient shoved a grandmother from a subway platform, killing her.
Despite the assurances of the Metropolitan Transit Authority's $1.7 million advertising campaign that the subways are safer and more pleasant, many riders yesterday said they had had more than enough. 
 "I'm a convicted felon, and I'm scared to death," said Ernest Scott, a messenger riding the E train yesterday. Mr. Scott served time in Attica and Sing Sing for armed robbery.
Elsewhere in the system, people stood back an extra step from the platform and looked over their shoulders more than usual, a day after Soon Sin of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, was pushed to her death in front of an F train at the station at 34th Street and Avenue of the Americas.
To many passengers, the death of Mrs. Sin seemed to underline the precariousness of urban existence.
"You just pray," Miriam Alleyne, an unemployed telephone operator who lives in Queens Village, said. "Before you leave home, you pray. Then at night, you say a prayer of thanks."
Others vowed to try to ignore the death. "I try to not go around thinking about fear," said Lisa Boggs, 35, a real-estate agent in Forest Hills, Queens. "It's not a good way to live."
Aida Soler, a waitress who lives in Elmhurst, Queens, said: "You're as cautious as you can be, but if you're standing next to wrong person, that's it."
The passengers were interviewed as they awaited trains on the northbound F train platform at 34th Street. It was there, the police said, that Reuben Harris, 42, a paranoid schizophrenic who had escaped from Manhattan Psychiatric Center on Wards Island, shoved Mrs. Sin, 63, onto the tracks. The motorman on a train saw her but could not stop in time.
Bill Sheehan, 54, a carpenter who lives in Manhattan, said that on that platform the day before, he had walked past a man who was talking to himself and giggling.
"I didn't want to walk close to the guy when I heard him talking," he said. "He looked like he was really having a problem. He was laughing."
Mr. Sheehan took the B train, which arrived only seconds before the F train that struck Mrs. Sin. "I only missed it by about 10 seconds," he said. "I thought, 'I bet I know who did it.' Then I saw the picture of him."
A transit police spokesman, Albert W. O'Leary, said that last year one person was killed after being pushed in front of a train, but there were no such deaths in the previous two years. He said he did not have information on how many people might have been pushed, but not killed.
Over all, the transit police say, reported crime in the subways has declined by about 50 percent in the last four years.
Still, Mr. O'Leary urged riders to be careful as they wait for trains and to stand behind the orange warning line.

N.H.L. Owners Say Proposal Doesn't Foster More Hope

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

 BODY:
Heading toward another critical Board of Governors meeting in New York tomorrow, the owners and executives of the National Hockey League teams expressed pessimism about the latest collective bargaining proposal from the Players Association.
The teams will vote on the plan submitted by the union on Wednesday in what shapes up as a last-ditch effort to end the lockout that has delayed the start of the season since Oct. 1. 
 The proposal calls for multiple concessions in arbitration, a rigid entry-level wage structure and sweeping changes in free agency that would lessen mobility for younger players while increasing it for veterans at the age of 30.
Neil Smith, president and general manager of the Rangers, would not reveal how his team would vote at the meeting but said he was "not very optimistic" about the proposal being accepted.
"It's definitely not what the owners are looking for," he said.
Smith and others said the free-agency aspect of the proposal would be difficult to accept in the absence of a tax or salary cap to discourage high payrolls.
"The player will hit the jackpot, a huge hit at age 27 or 28," Smith said.
Jack Ferreira, general manager of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, said it is a "foregone conclusion" that the proposal would be voted down. "It doesn't fly," he said.
The league last proposed a payroll tax of up to 25 percent on entire payrolls that go above a predetermined trigger point. The union rejected it as a salary cap.
With the lockout in its 98th day, the 26 owners have several options to consider before their meeting, including:
*Accepting the proposal and announcing the start of the season, if smaller details can be worked out quickly.
*Rejecting the proposal and canceling the season.
*Rejecting the proposal and continuing the bargaining.
Even if the owners were to accept the basic concepts of the "systems issues," the sides still must negotiate issues such as pro-rated pay and bonuses for the current season, length of future seasons and continuation of neutral-site games.
If Commissioner Gary Bettman recommends the proposal, a simple majority could pass it. If not, a three-quarters majority would be needed to over-rule him. As of yesterday, Bettman had not made his decision public, although some executives said they doubted if he would endorse the proposal.
Bob Goodenow, executive director of the Players Association, spoke by conference call yesterday with player representatives and faxed them copies of the proposal. Bettman's office in New York sent the information to the owners.
"It doesn't even reflect most of the points discussed," John McMullen, the Devils' owner, said of the offer. "I don't know how Bob Goodenow dreamed it up. This is a sad state of affairs. I don't see it as a step forward. It's a disappointing document."
Last week, Bettman set a start date of Jan. 16 to play a 50-game season and four full rounds of playoffs by July 1. Allowing for a week of training, a deal is necessary this weekend to follow the league's timetable.
Should the season be canceled, the union has said it will sponsor its own tournament, involving about a dozen teams and lasting several months. Some players and agents have planned new leagues. One of them is Mark Messier, the Ranger captain, who said one could begin this winter.
Dick Patrick, president of the Washington Capitals, was asked if owners would consider imposing their own rules and open their camps, in the manner of strike-bound baseball.
"Yes, I think it's a possibility, but not until it is certain the season is lost," Patrick said. "It hasn't been discussed in any of our meetings, but it has been discussed" in private.
Highlights of the proposal include:
*New free agency rules. Players could become unfettered free agents at the age of 30 if not under contract; elimination of free agency for younger players.
*Entry-level salary structure. The three-year rookie cap would begin at $900,000 next summer, including signing bonus but excluding performance bonuses. Figure would rise to $1.225 million in year 2000. The union says this hurts wages of older stars who now get raises by comparing their pay with high-salaried rookies; mandatory "two-way" contracts for rookies, with half-pay for minor league service.
*Reductions in arbitration rights. It would be eliminated until the age of 24 and after the age of 29. Between those ages, teams would have the right to "walk away" from one award per year if they felt it is too high. The player would become a free agent.
*Shared financial help from the union, the teams and league for some Canadian teams, from smaller markets, to make up differential with American currency in retaining free agents; Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver excluded.
*Roster maximum of 24, instead of unlimited as it is now; plus injured reserve list.
Pat Quinn, the Vancouver president, said: "I was amazed to read it this afternoon. It's more inflationary than the last agreement."
Among the most optimistic of the executives was Gerry Meehan, executive vice president of the Buffalo Sabres, who said the players "have made some significant movement" and that it provides "a good framework" for more negotiation.
"As I look at the looming cancellation of the season," he said, "I'm trying to find enough positive features in it to be optimistic."

HEADLINE: The G.O.P. Squeeze on New York

 BODY:
In his first speech as House Speaker, Newt Gingrich smoothly portrayed the Republicans' "Contract With America" as an uplifting program for the nation. But tranquilizing rhetoric cannot mask the program's potential harm for a city that already exports more Federal tax dollars than it gets back. That powerful message emerges from a report, issued by Representative Charles Schumer of Brooklyn, that provides rough estimates of the impact of G.O.P. spending cuts on the residents of New York City. The chilling numbers document an obligation to protect their constituents that now falls on members of the city's Congressional delegation, especially Alfonse D'Amato, New York's influential Republican Senator.
Mr. Schumer makes a straightforward calculation. To fulfill the contract's pledge to balance the Federal budget and cut taxes, Congress would have to cut about $ 350 billion out of the budget in the year 2002. But the contract would exempt Social Security, defense and interest on the national debt, thus drastically narrowing the places to find the money. It means Congress would have to chop 30 percent out of all the non-exempt programs. 
 New Yorkers, Mr. Schumer notes, currently receive 4.3 percent of the Federal dollars spent on these non-exempt programs and could therefore expect to bear at least 4.3 percent of the proposed cuts. Using the 4.3 percent yardstick, Mr. Schumer calculates that New Yorkers would lose almost $ 2 billion in 1996, ballooning to a $ 15 billion loss -- on average about $ 2,000 per person -- in the year 2002. Of course, the poor -- who rely on Federal programs like Medicaid, food stamps and public housing -- would suffer. But so would other citizens, who would get even less for their Federal tax dollars. Subway travelers, for example, would pay perhaps 15 cents more for tokens. There would be less money for magnet schools and Federal job training programs for the unskilled.
In the G.O.P. view, Mr. Schumer's study tells only part of the story. Republicans also promise to lift a number of mandates and to cut taxes, especially on the affluent. Because New York City has many high-income families, its overall tax burden might decline a bit. But here, too, the benefits seem more designed to attract the truly greedy than help the truly needy in a town that winds up housing and feeding poor people from other states.
In any event, the spending cuts would still be more than three times the size of the tax cuts, and any attempt to make up for lost Federal dollars by raising local taxes would harm a struggling economy. New local taxes could drive upper-income families out of the city, if not the state.
Rethinking Federal programs can be healthy. But New York's Congressional delegation needs to make sure the city is not disproportionately hit by frenzied budget-cutting. Senator D'Amato, the new chairman of the Finance Committee, is uniquely positioned to help. Here, the Senator and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani may finally find common cause.

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief Chides Security Council on Military Missions

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali accused the Security Council today of "micromanaging" peacekeeping operations at the expense of his authority and that of ground commanders. And he criticized governments he did not name for demanding strong and costly action and then failing to support it.
In a progress report on the last two years of United Nations intervention in world crises, Mr. Boutros-Ghali also said the world body should take a harder look at the negative effects of sanctions on people living under renegade governments. 
 His comments, in a paper that described the peacekeeping operations as an overstretched and underfinanced department forced to take on ever widening roles, drew a quick retort from Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate.
"It is absolutely appropriate for the Secretary General to be making this kind of report with this type of analysis in it," she said after the Security Council meeting. But then, reopening an old debate between Washington and the United Nations on the limits of the Secretary General's role, she added, "To the extent that the report seems to arrogate more power to the Secretary General -- and his discussion of micromanagement of the Security Council -- we think that that goes a little bit too far.
"And also to the extent that it assesses blame, I think it's a little bit off the mark," she went on in remarks that pre-empted Mr. Boutros-Ghali's news conference on his report, an update of the 1992 Agenda for Peace. "I think we have to guard against saying that every time there is a success, it is due to the United Nations, and every time there is a failure, it is due to the member states."
But Ms. Albright and other delegates welcomed the report as a basis for talks on streamlining operations. "Basically what I see in all this is that peacekeeping, peacemaking, peace-building is a work in progress and one in which the United Nations has to make constant adjustments," she said.
She said the debate here was mirrored in one that will take place in the United States as a Republican-led Congress talks about cutting back participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations. The Clinton Administration is already bound by law to cut the United States contribution to peacekeeping assessments to 25 percent, from 31 percent, in October.
Ms. Albright has said that disagreements notwithstanding, she plans to campaign in support of the United Nations around the United States this year, the 50th anniversary of the organization.
In his report, Mr. Boutros-Ghali suggested that the United Nations develop a supply of ready-response troops from various countries to be dispatched to crisis areas quickly and maintain larger stocks of equipment to supply them.
But he also said he was having difficulty finding qualified special emissaries to oversee missions for long periods of time. Mr. Boutros-Ghali, more than his predecessors, has developed the practice of having his own civilian representatives in charge in the field, like Yasushi Akashi in the former Yugoslavia and Shahyar Khan in Rwanda.
Some of most forthright language in the report was applied to sanctions, however. In the cases of Iraq and Serbia in particular, this issue has led to heated disagreements in the Security Council. Those two countries are to be the center of debate again next week when the Council faces a deadline on whether to extend an easing of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics that now make up federal Yugoslavia -- and for how long -- and reviews the compliance of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
The Iraqis have been active in promoting the idea that sanctions are damaging the health and well-being of a guiltless civilian population. In the Balkans and Eastern Europe, some countries have argued that sanctions against the Serbs are hurting neighboring economies.
Sanctions are "a blunt instrument," the Secretary General wrote. "They raise the ethical question of whether suffering inflicted on vulnerable groups in the target country is a legitimate means of exerting pressure on political leaders whose behavior is unlikely to be affected by the plight of their subjects."
Mr. Boutros-Ghali advocated the creation of a system to assess the results of sanctions before they are imposed and then to "fine tune" them to increase their political effect and keep human suffering at a minimum.
At his news conference, the Secretary General said that whatever the limitations of the United Nations, it had the "moral obligation" to go to crisis areas.
He also said he sensed that the world was moving toward the recognition that "genocide is a common threat to humanity" and that this alone should propel countries to be more active in preventive diplomacy as well as peacekeeping, even when there were no immediate strategic threats.

HEADLINE: U.S. CLOSED YEAR WITH EMPLOYMENT GROWING SHARPLY

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
A surprisingly robust American economy ended the year by generating more than a quarter-million new jobs in December, making the 1994 gain in employment the greatest in a decade, the Government reported today.
The unemployment rate slipped to 5.4 percent last month, the lowest level since July 1990 and comparable with levels not widely experienced at any other time since the early 1970's. 
 Economists said the latest job figures, which provided the first broad look at the economy's performance last month, showed strength that would probably carry well into 1995. By midyear, however, most expect the economy to be slowed by the cumulative effects of the step-by-step interest rate increases begun by the Federal Reserve last February.
And with the latest indication of the underlying force of the economy, it seems all the more likely that the Fed will raise short-term interest rates again within a month, probably by at least half a percentage point.
"Vroom!" said John R. Williams, an economist at Bankers Trust Research in New York. "That sound of high-speed acceleration sums up the U.S. economic engine as the Federal Reserve diligently pumps the brakes."
The Clinton Adminstration moved quickly to trumpet the latest jobs report. "We have grown the private economy as we have cut government," President Clinton declared at a White House photo session. "That's a real recovery and a real bargain for the American people."
For the year, the economy added about 3.5 million jobs, a million more than in 1993. It was the largest annual increase in jobs since 1984.
Unemployment fell broadly across the nation in December. The jobless rate in California, one of the last states to emerge from recession, eased to 7.4 percent from 7.7 percent in the previous month. Among the 11 most populous states, North Carolina had the lowest jobless rate, at 3.3 percent, while unemployment in Texas rose to 6 percent from 5.5 percent.
While the 256,000 payroll jobs added in December represented a very healthy increase, what was even more impressive was a huge revision upward in the figures for November, to 488,000. That gave November the largest monthly increase in seven years. Originally, the Labor Department reported that 350,000 people were added to nonfarm payrolls in November.
Another indication of the growing competitiveness of American industry was a broadly based 54,000 jump in manufacturing jobs. That lifted the gain in factory jobs for the year to nearly 300,000. By contrast, the United States lost 130,000 jobs in 1993 despite a business recovery that started two years earlier.
Despite the big back-to-back monthly increases in jobs, the bond market registered little concern today about whether the surge implied that higher inflation was just around the corner. Indeed, after an early decline, bonds rallied and finished the day with modest gains, pulling down interest rates. Stock prices also climbed, paced by the industries most sensitive to the business cycle and by technology issues.
Some analysts attributed the reversal to a midmorning report suggesting that the Federal Reserve might hold further increases in short-term interest rates in abeyance because of the economic crisis in Mexico. Higher rates would tend to make the dollar stronger against the Mexican peso, which has already been battered.
While there is a certain plausibility to the belief that the Fed may proceed cautiously for that reason, most experts expressed doubts that Mexico's troubles would stay the central bank's hand.
By themselves, the figures released today included almost no sign of the widely anticipated slowdown of the economy from an annual pace that may have hit more than 5 percent for the final three months of 1994. For the year, growth in output is now all but certain to exceed 4 percent.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected, particularly by investors in the bond market, to use the only real weapon at its disposal -- higher interest rates -- to try to bring that vigorous growth rate down to a more sustainable level. The Fed could act even before its Open Market Committee holds its next meeting -- a two-day session beginning on Jan. 31 -- but few economists saw that as likely.
"I think the Fed will raise rates," said Daniel Laufenberg, an economist with the American Express Financial Corporation in Minneapolis. The December job figure, he added, "makes three-quarters of a point more likely."
While the central bank normally moves interest rates by one-quarter or one-half of a percentage point, the Fed in mid-November raised the overnight bank borrowing rate it closely controls by an unusually large three-quarters of a percentage point to a target rate of 5.5 percent. A year ago, before the Fed started raising rates, the so-called Federal funds rate was 3 percent.
Central bankers at the Fed have said repeatedly that they would like to reduce economic growth to roughly 2.5 to 3 percent -- a rate that many economists believe can be sustained without reviving higher inflation. That pace reflects population growth of about 1 percent and gains in the productivity of the work force that most analysts believe are unlikely to exceed 1.5 to 2 percent.
Some analysts, therefore, fret that the jobless rate is at about the lowest level that can be sustained without raising the inflation specter, while others are convinced that a growing economy can push the unemployment level even lower without serious risk.
Today's Labor Department report showed that average hourly earnings rose a negligible 3 cents in December, to $11.26, while average weekly earnings rose $1.04, or three-tenths of 1 percent, to $389.60. For all of 1994, hourly earnings climbed 2.8 percent and weekly earnings were up 3 percent.
Jobs in retailing gained 91,000 last month, many of them in bars and restaurants. Temporary help and computer and health services also had hefty gains.
Construction was little changed, but this followed an exceptionally big November jump that reflected warm autumn weather, analysts said.
The job figures for November were also pushed up by an extra 50,000 poll workers on Election Day who were not recorded in the initial estimate and 70,000 retail workers who also did not show up in the early figures.
There were some marked variations by region, with the Northeast's jobless rate falling to 5.6 percent from 6.1, the West's moving to 6.4 from 6.7, the South's edging down to 5.3 percent and the Midwest's dropping to 4.5 percent.
In December, 7,155,000 Americans were reported to be out of work, down from 8,696,000 in January 1994, a thinning in the ranks of the unemployed equivalent to the population of Nebraska.
The department also published its annual updating of the seasonal factors with which it smooths data by removing the effects of recurring events like severe weather. This resulted in an increase of one-tenth of a point in the unemployment rates that were initially reported for February, May and June of 1994 and declines of the same size for the rates in August, September and October.

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: Political Memo;
Democrats Try to Cope With Their New Role

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
His famous line is from 1933, but Will Rogers might well have been commenting on the capital this week when he said, "I don't belong to any organized political faith -- I am a Democrat."
While Republicans have moved in unison, capitalizing on their new power, the Democrats have been almost paralyzed, often not knowing quite how or when to act or even react. 
 No one expects the good will and discipline among Republicans to last forever. Still, the contrast between the parties has rarely been so stark -- and has led some Democrats to wonder openly whether their party has what it takes to remake itself in the shadow of Newt Gingrich.
"Republicans are on a roll, and when you're on a roll, you feel pretty confident," said John R. Petrocik, a political science professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. "The Democrats look pretty pitiful. They're chasing after the cameras saying, 'I've got something to say,' when they don't have much to say."
While the Republicans in Congress now hold slimmer margins than the Democrats did in the last Congress, they have been far more cohesive -- at least so far. In roll call after roll call on Wednesday, every Republicans voted together -- a unanimity no one can remember the Democrats attaining when they ran the chamber. In fact, the ever-fractious House Democrats could not even get their entire caucus to vote for Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri as their leader, even though his election at that point was a formality. Two Democrats voted "present" rather than support Mr. Gephardt.
The difference was visible even beyond the Capitol grounds. The Republican National Committee, seeking to make the most of the good will toward the party, began a series of television commercials backing the Republican agenda in Congress. The first is a pitch for a balanced budget amendment. Republicans will win backing for the balanced budget, the announcer says, "because we're doing what we promised."
The public relations blitz continued today when Republican governors came to Washington to discuss the balanced budget, welfare reform and other issues.
By contrast, the Democrats' national organization appears all but shut down. In only two weeks, the Democratic National Committee is to meet here to ratify whomever the President selects as national chairman. But Mr. Clinton has not yet settled on anyone for the job, which involves raising money to pay off a $4 million debt and leading the party into the 1996 Presidential campaign.
Debra DeLee, a former education lobbyist, has replaced David Wilhelm in the post only temporarily, and each day seems to bring new rumors about whom Mr. Clinton favors. The latest names floating are Representative Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey; Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut; former Gov. James J. Blanchard of Michigan, now the Ambassador to Canada, and Thomas F. McLarty 3d, a senior counselor to the President.
While Mr. Clinton spoke cordially with Republican leaders in Congress, left-wing Democrats have spoken out against them. The most outspoken voice is that of Jesse Jackson, who is toying publicly with challenging the President either in the Democratic primaries or with a third party. At a meeting here this week of his National Rainbow Coalition, Mr. Jackson sounded a battle cry intended to put the Democrats on notice: "The meeting will be a first step in making the progressive movement a stronger force inside or outside the Democratic Party."
But other Democrats said the Administration could get pointers from the Republican Party. "The Republican Party at every level -- Congressional, institutional, grass roots and in their think tanks -- understands that people want transformational leadership," said Terry Michael, a former spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. "Until Democrats figure that out, until we end our denial of the legitimacy of the anger and get leadership with the guts to be bold, we will be left in the dust."
On the other hand, the Republicans may start to look more like the Democrats, at least as far as party discipline is concerned. Republicans have traditionally been more harmonious than Democrats, in part because the party has represented a narrow range of viewpoints. But now that the Republicans control the House and Senate, and now that the party encompasses a broader coalition of sometimes conflicting factions of social-issue conservatives and country-club Republicans, there are bound to be more tensions.
"Republicans haven't had a chance to find out what they disagree on," Mr. Petrocik said. "With Democrats as the new majority party, it might be easier for them to come together and respond more cohesively by critiquing the Republican policy than formulating a policy."
Further, voters have high expectations that the Republicans may not be able to satisfy. That is a problem Mr. Clinton himself is struggling with now.
Gerald M. Pomper, a political science professor at Rutgers University, warned that people should not interpret the Democrats' disarray as a sure sign of continued failure. Part of the problem, he said, is that the party needs to get accustomed to its new role.
"There's no Democrat in the House who's ever been in the minority, so that's quite a shock," he said. But he warned Republicans not to underestimate the power of the Presidency as "the most important centralizing force in American politics."
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, gives the Republicans credit for putting on a good show. He said his party just needed some time.
"The glitz and the sizzle looked good," he said. "But I'm not sure there's enough steak underneath to sustain the sizzle for very long."

HEADLINE: French Talk to Iraqis, Angering Allies

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Drawing sharp criticism from the United States and Britain, France received a senior Iraqi official today for the first time since the Persian Gulf war of 1991 and agreed to open a diplomatic office in Baghdad soon.
In separate statements, the United States and Britain said that they had not been consulted about the French moves and that the moment was not ripe for easing international pressure on Iraq to comply fully with Security Council resolutions. 
 The visit by the Iraqi official, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, brought no sweeping breakthrough in Iraq's campaign to end its isolation and obtain a relaxation of United Nations sanctions, including a punishing oil-trade embargo, that have shriveled the Iraqi economy.
After a breakfast meeting with Mr. Aziz, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told reporters that France continued to insist that Iraq comply fully with all Security Council resolutions. "Some progress has been made over the past months," he said. "More remains to be done."
Mr. Juppe described France's decision to open a diplomatic "interests section" at the Romanian Embassy in Baghdad as "a technical step that will enable us to settle questions linked to the break of diplomatic relations." There is a United States Interests Section in Iraq, at the Polish Embassy.
But the meeting today was nonetheless viewed here and in other capitals as a significant good-will gesture to Baghdad, signaling that once United Nations sanctions are lifted, France expects to be rewarded with new business opportunities. Several high-level French business delegations visited Iraq last year for preliminary talks.
France has another reason to want normal economic ties with Iraq: Before the gulf war, France was Iraq's main arms supplier and is still owed an estimated $5 billion for various military and civilian contracts. French companies are also eager to take part in the rebuilding of Iraq's oil industry.
France suggested an easing of the oil embargo after Iraq's decision late last year to recognize Kuwait's borders. The timing of the moves today was significant because the Security Council is to meet next week to review Iraq's compliance with resolutions demanding the destruction of facilities that make weapons of mass destruction.
Britain was the first to criticize France. "It is not the moment to relax pressure on Iraq to comply fully with United Nations requirements," a Foreign Office spokesman said, adding that Britain remained "very suspicious" of Iraq since it massed troops on its border with Kuwait last October.
Later in the day a State Department spokeswoman, Christine D. Shelly, said Washington did not consider France's decision to open an interests section to be "helpful or constructive." She added: "We do not believe that now is the appropriate time to make gestures toward Iraq."
Ms. Shelly said Baghdad continued to violate Security Council resolutions, notably by failing to cooperate with a United Nations special commission monitoring its weapons programs. "We believe that such behavior should not be rewarded," she said.
After his meeting with Mr. Juppe, Mr. Aziz, who served as Iraq's Foreign Minister during the gulf war, insisted that Iraq was cooperating with the United Nations commission. "But the Security Council must in return make a positive step toward the softening of sanctions against Iraq in keeping with a fair and legalistic interpretation of the Council's resolutions," he said.
Mr. Juppe, who met Mr. Aziz privately in New York four months ago, seemed to make a point today of not appearing to be too friendly toward the Iraqi official. He noted that Baghdad still had to release some 600 Kuwaiti prisoners and end human rights abuses. But he added, "The present stalemate benefits nobody."

HEADLINE: Governor Proposes Tax Cut in California

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Jan. 6

 BODY:
Gov. Pete Wilson said today that he would ask the State Legislature to cut personal and business income taxes by 15 percent over three years.
The Republican Governor, beginning his second four-year term, said he would seek the tax cuts recommended to him last month by a group of economic advisers. 
 Speaking on Rush Limbaugh's syndicated radio show, Governor Wilson said lower taxes would put California in a much better position competitively. "We are a high-tax state," he said.
Californians with adjusted gross incomes of more than $200,000 a year now pay state income taxes at a top rate of 11 percent. The Governor's proposal would cut that rate to 9.4 percent. Businesses currently pay 9.3 percent of their profit, and that rate would drop to 7.9 percent
The Governor's advisory group, which was led by former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, said the tax reductions would amount to $9.1 billion.
This year, California borrowed $7 billion to stay afloat financially, and $3 billion must be paid off in the fiscal year that ends on June 30, and another $4 billion is due in 1996. The state's total budget amounts to $52 billion this year.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
With Season at the Brink, Compromise Is Still Absent

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

 BODY:
Pat Quinn, a former player and coach in the National Hockey League, is the president and general manager of the Vancouver Canucks. He has a law degree and three decades of experience in professional hockey. But he has never experienced anything quite like this lockout, which is in its 99th day.
 Quinn will attend the Board of Governors meeting today in New York in which the latest collective bargaining proposal from the Players Association is expected to be rejected. 
 The owners and Commissioner Gary Bettman have threatened to cancel the season if 50 games and a full slate of playoffs do not begin by Jan. 16. Will the owners make a counterproposal or suggest further negotiations. Will they push back the starting date or simply announce a cancellation of the season?
 "There will be a lot of discussion," Quinn said. "It's at a disastrous point where nobody expected. We'll find out a lot about ourselves."
 Guy Carbonneau of St. Louis, a member of the bargaining committee, said: "We don't want to hear about any counterproposal. If the owners turn down our offer, it's all over."
 "We've given them our best offer," said Joe Sakic of Quebec. "If they reject it, the season is canceled." Bill Ranford of Edmonton said "the season is a wash" if the owners reject the deal. Bob Corkum of Anaheim said: "It's now a matter of principle. It looks grim."
 After more than three months of economic struggle, even the most strident of the owners and executives admit to deep disappointment with the current proposal from the players.
 Quinn and his colleagues say that without a payroll tax to discourage spending, the union's latest offer wouldn't solve their problem of escalating wages because free agency at age 30 would create bidding wars for stars or force the signing of them to long-term contracts at high rates of pay when they are 27 or 28 years old. The union has rejected the tax, calling it a salary cap.
 If the owners were to vote by secret ballot, there are probably six to 10 teams that would vote to play. Among them are the Rangers, the Islanders and the St. Louis Blues. The Pittsburgh Penguins, the Buffalo Sabres and the Chicago Blackhawks are among those that might be swayed in that direction.
 The Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Detroit Red Wings and Dallas Stars have never been among the hard-line hawks who have successfully steered the league on its current, confrontational course.
 But it is clear that the hawks have had control of the agenda. They include teams from New Jersey, Boston, Edmonton, Hartford, Winnipeg, Florida and Tampa. And it is also evident that their lockout has been a failure, thus far, at least according to their definition of success. Despite the loss of salary, the players haven't caved in, and don't appear about to do so.
 Before the lockout, Bettman warned the owners to be prepared to cancel the season, and such a decision is nearing. Some teams have taken on lines of credit to cover expenses. David LeFevre, governor of the Tampa Bay Lightning, said owners had "targets set since last July" that haven't yet been met.
 "This is the year selected to deal with it," he said, referring to an economic overhaul of the business. "This is the time."
 LeFevre said a shorter season of 42 or 40 games would be a mistake.
 "You can't fool the fans," he said. "You can't have a phony season. This is it. I firmly believe in the 50 games and the Jan. 16 date. I don't think fans can withstand more uncertainty about hockey. We can't afford any more wheel-spinning. It's clearly decision time. I wouldn't vote to go back to the table. I think the table is worn out."
 Players also appear to have hardened in their refusal to make more concessions. "This is our last offer," said John LeClair of Montreal, who said the owners "don't think the union is that strong."
 "But they're mistaken," he said.
 Arthur Pincus, spokesman for the N.H.L., said Bettman and his top aides were unavailable for comment.

HEADLINE: Butterflies and Bravado At Debate Competition

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., Jan. 5

 BODY:
It does not matter that they are all great debaters in their own countries. The competition here this week at the 15th World Universities Debating Championship at Princeton University featuring the best student speakers from 27 nations has them all a little nervous.
 "In Canada, we get a lot of respect," said Paul Ciufo, 24, a creative writing student at York University in Canada. "But it's hard to compete with teams like Oxford who have reputations on the international circuit." He complained that the judges were too quick to be impressed with any idea delivered with a British accent.
 "The Irish go more for style than facts," said Dermot Conway, a member of the University of Cork team, which will be the host of the 1996 championship. "It's like sitting down and having a good argument with a friend."
 Nick McGrath, a kilted debater from the University of Glasgow, fretted that Americans who judge the debates were having difficulty understanding his accent and his humor.
 Enthusiasm ran high all week as 244 two-member teams from more than 100 schools paired off in a series of preliminary rounds to decide the 32 top teams that will square off this weekend to battle for the world championship. There will have been up to 1,130 separate debates by Sunday's championship finals.
 In an age when television and other electronic devices have elevated sound and diminished conversation, it is consoling to some to know that a premium on the art of persuasion and logical discourse is still embraced by young people who can go for the jugular one moment and then go out for a drink together.
 "The quality of political speeches is so poor in the United States today that it is marvelous to see students who may eventually enter public service get up on their feet and construct complete sentences and sometimes do it with a degree of spontaneous wit," said Dr. John Fleming, a Princeton professor of English and comparative literature who is master of Wilson College on campus.
 Ross Harper, 21, from the University of Glasgow, said, "I think it's a safe bet to say that many of the debaters here are going to be in the top levels of power in their countries in 10 or 20 years."
 Most of the 488 debaters will go on to careers in law and politics, said Chris Paolella, a Princeton junior who is serving as tournament director.
 It was the fate of Mr. Ciufo and his partner, Lawrence Rabie, to meet the Oxford team in the one "humorous" debate of the tournament assigned to all of the 244 teams.
 Representing Oxford was the star-quality team of Rufus Black, an Australian, and Rod Clayton. It was their duty, one they took up with alacrity, to defend the proposition "American Culture Is an Oxymoron." The Canadians, by the draw announced only 20 minutes before the start, were on the attack.
 Mr. Clayton ripped into American culture, tossing off several lines of verse in Latin in an exhibition of what he championed as real culture as compared to the "low culture" exported by Americans.
 In rebuttal, Mr. Rabie spun out a bit of verse himself.
 "Bye, bye Miss American Pie.
 "Took my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry."
 Not to be outdone, Mr. Black, a finalist in last year's championship, relied on an old four-letter Anglo-Saxon word to characterize his sentiments about the quality of American culture, an angle of attack that likely cost him points with the judge, Steven Johnson, 26, a lecturer in rhetoric from Creighton College in Kansas.
 "Rufus is one of the best debaters in the world on a serious subject but to see him dancing around the room speaking profanities goes beyond the substance of argumentation," Mr. Johnson said.
 Oxford was awarded the match but both teams, by the end of the preliminary rounds, were among the 32 teams chosen for the semifinals, as was the Glasgow team of Mr. Harper and Mr. McGrath.
 Daily results and rankings are supposed to be a closely guarded secret but team members seemed to spend most of their time between debates trying to breach the security of the tabulation committee operated by Princeton's venerable American Whig-Cliosophic Society (charter members were James Madison and Aaron Burr), which as host for the tournament did not enter its own teams in the debates.
 "I wish there was a trophy for tab room leaks," said Mr. Rabie, the Canadian. "I'd walk away with it. My secret is to tell a judge who scored my debate that I heard I had won it and watch his reaction before he runs away from me."
 During a break in the competition, an Irish student got on the public address system and listed the charms that awaited them in Cork next year. "The judging will be appalling but the tab room will leak like a sieve," he said to cheers.

HEADLINE: Pataki Picks New Labor and Utility Chiefs

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki is expected to name John E. Sweeney, the executive director and counsel to the Republican State Committee, to be State Labor Commissioner, aides to Mr. Pataki said today.
 In addition, Mr. Pataki said today that he had named Harold A. Jerry Jr. as interim chairman of the state Public Service Commission, the state agency that regulates utilities. Mr. Jerry, a former Republican State Senator who has been a commissioner for 22 years, said he would remain in the top post only until Mr. Pataki finds a permanent chairman. 
 The news of the appointments came on a day when the new Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, named his two top legal advisers: Francis T. Collins, his longtime Senate counsel, and David R. Dudley, his former campaign manager.
 Mr. Collins, who will have the title of executive counsel, will oversee the flow of legislation through Senate committees and on to the Senate floor. Mr. Dudley, who will have the title of counsel, will handle intergovernmental relations and deal with lobbyists. Both men are expected to handle negotiations over bills with the Governor's office and the Assembly Democratic leadership. Each will be paid $90,000 a year.
 Mr. Dudley, 50, was chairman of the Rensselaer County Republican Committee from 1991 until September 1992, when a new county ethics law was approved, preventing county party officials from also holding county jobs. Mr. Dudley had been counsel to the county's Industrial Development Agency at the same time he was county party chairman.
 Mr. Dudley said the ethics law was largely aimed at him. From 1986 through 1992, his law firm received about $445,000 in legal fees for the development agency, mostly for handling bond sales. Rensselaer County Democrats charged that Mr. Dudley had used his political influence to secure his counsel position and other legal work. Mr. Dudley denied it.
Mr. Dudley ran the 1976 Senate campaign for Mr. Bruno and the 1986 campaign for the Rensselaer County Executive, John L. Buono. He is also close to the state Republican chairman, William D. Powers, himself a former Rensselaer County chairman.
 In an interview today, Mr. Dudley said he had helped revive a lackadaisical agency and brought 26 new projects to the county. "If you don't do anything, you don't get paid," he said.
 Mr. Bruno said Mr. Dudley would not do any outside legal work while in the Senate job.
 "He's coming in with no baggage and as far as I'm concerned, he'll be a tremendous asset," he said.
 As State Labor Commissioner, Mr. Sweeney will run an agency with 5,100 employees and a $733 million budget. It runs the Federal unemployment insurance program, oversees wage and job safety laws and runs a host of training programs.
 The son of a former leader of a shirt-cutter's union in Troy, Mr. Sweeney had been named just a week ago as counsel to the Office of Employee Relations, the agency that handles state labor negotiations. But aides to Mr. Pataki said Mr. Sweeney changed his mind about which job he wanted.
 Mr. Sweeney was paid $99,935 by the state Republican Party, where he has worked since 1992. The labor commissioner's job currently pays $95,635.
 In his work with the state party, Mr. Sweeney, who lives in Schaghticoke in Rensselaer County, played a major role in building the grass-roots organization that helped sweep Mr. Pataki to victory. He was also the architect of lawsuits last year that accused former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of using state aircraft for personal and political purposes during the campaign.
 Mr. Jerry, 74, the interim head of the Public Service Commission, replaces Peter A. Bradford, a Democrat. The job pays $91,957 a year.
 Mr. Jerry owns a home in Albany but lists as his official residence a log cabin without electricity in the village of Speculator in the Adirondacks. He is widely respected by environmentalists, having served on the boards of several groups, including the Wilderness Society and the Adirondack Council.
 But consumer advocates criticized his record on utility rates. "He has generally voted with the things we don't like," said Robert Ceisler, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, a private, nonprofit group that lobbies for lower rates.

HEADLINE: Currency Markets;
Dollar Advances on Reports Of Robust Employment Data

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against leading currencies yesterday as a robust United States employment report reaffirmed expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at the end of the month.
 "The market was looking for the right number to give the dollar a rally at the beginning of 1995," said Hillel Waxman, manager of currency trading at Bank Leumi Trust Company. 
 The Labor Department said the economy added more than 250,000 jobs in December, pushing the unemployment rate down to 5.4 percent.
 "The employment report helped the dollar," said Paul Farrell, manager of strategic currency trading at Chase Manhattan Bank. "The conclusion drawn was that this report was strong enough to convince the Fed" to raise short-term interest rates after its policy-making committee meets at the end of the month, he said. Higher rates often buoy the dollar by making dollar-denominated bank deposits more attractive.
 In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5643 German marks from 1.5510 marks on Thursday. It edged up to 101.37 Japanese yen from 100.87 yen.
 The dollar was also helped by strength in the United States bond market and by strife in Russia.
 Bonds rebounded after an initial drop on the employment report, as investors concluded that last year's explosive job growth would not continue through 1995, traders said.
 "People are keeping one eye on bonds," said Charles Spence, director of currency sales at Standard Chartered Bank. Currency dealers monitor the bond market to gauge investors' demand for American assets and the dollars needed to buy them.
 And the dollar often rises against the mark when Russia appears unsteady because Germany is Russia's largest creditor. Russia stepped up its attack on the capital of the secessionist southern region of Chechnya yesterday despite vows by President Boris N. Yeltsin to rein in the assault.
 "The problems in Russia favor the dollar," said Varick Martin, manager of currency trading at Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company. "Between the unemployment numbers suggesting we don't have any, and the Russian situation, everything out there is pretty good for the dollar."
 In other currency trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.3105 Swiss francs from 1.3005 francs on Thursday. The British pound fell to $1.5495 from $1.5630.

HEADLINE: Mexico Asks I.M.F. for Loan Of $2.5 Billion as Peso Falls

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
As the Mexican peso fell to a new low, the nation's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, asked the International Monetary Fund yesterday for a new loan that would effectively add $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion to the country's monetary reserves in an effort to revive confidence in the Mexican economy and stabilize the peso.
 A brief statement issued after Mr. Ortiz met in Washington with the I.M.F.'s managing director, Michel Camdessus, said discussions on the loan would start next week in Mexico City. The loan would be available on a standby basis, allowing Mexico to draw it down as needed. 
 The peso dropped about 7.7 percent yesterday, to 5.795 to the dollar -- its lowest level since the peso was devalued almost three weeks ago. The peso has now declined by 40 percent against the dollar since the Dec. 20 devaluation and is now worth about 17 cents, compared with 29 cents. Meanwhile, the Mexican stock market index fell just under 1 percent yesterday. Telefonos de Mexico's American depository receipts on the New York Stock Exchange fell $1.125, to $36.875.
 The peso and the Mexican stock market had rallied briefly on Thursday when Mr. Ortiz visited New York to seek support from bankers for the Government's economic strategy.
 The I.M.F. said the measures Mexico had announced for controlling inflation and reducing its payments deficit provided a solid basis for discussions on an agreement that could be supported by I.M.F. resources."
 "Accordingly," the agency said, "an I.M.F. team will travel to Mexico next week to start negotiations on a standby credit."
 Mexican officials say the decision to seek a new loan is primarily intended to strengthen international confidence in Mexico's economy by showing that the I.M.F. believes that Mexico is likely to succeed with its measures to control inflation and translate a weaker peso into an export-led recovery.
 Mexico, which last borrowed from the I.M.F. toward the end of the Latin American debt crisis in 1989, still has to repay about $3.7 billion of that loan. As a result, it is entitled to borrow up to about $2.5 billion in any single year to support a new economic adjustment program intended to make its economy more competitive, or up to $3.5 billion over the life of a multiyear program.
 As matters stand now, these officials say Mexico does not believe it will ever need to draw down the money, although the credit would still reinforce the $18 billion package of credit lines the country has already opened with the United States, Canada and the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. In addition Mexico has about $6 billion in its official reserves.
 Immediately after Mexico's devaluation last month, investors and bankers were concerned that the Government did not have a credible plan to stabilize the peso and prevent the benefits of devaluation being worn away in inflation.
 But Mr. Ortiz, with his appearance before bankers on Thursday and his request for an I.M.F. standby loan, appears to have largely laid such fears to rest.
 Moreover, the Government has given in to foreign demands that it encourage a renewed inflow of foreign capital by privatizing attractive state properties, including Pemex's petrochemical operations and part of the electricity generating monopoly.
 But Mexico's creditors are now starting to wonder whether the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon will have the political authority to carry out the tough economic measures it has promised.
 "The general feeling is, is the P.R.I. up to this, up to imposing more austerity when real wages have been falling for several years?" said Sarah Lavers, Mexican specialist with Latin Invest, a London based research firm, referring to Mexico's long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.
 Jean van der Walle of Alliance Capital Management called the plan logical, but said, "The question is, can they implement it after all the political capital President Zedillo has lost?"
 The P.R.I., which has ruled Mexico for the last 60 years, is divided between a conservative old guard and a reform-minded younger wing lead by President Zedillo, whose authority has already been badly dented by the devaluation crisis.
 An early test of the Mexican Government's strategy for stabilizing the peso and taming inflation comes in the last week of this month and the first week of February, when two separate batches of dollar-indexed Mexican treasury bills, each worth $1.3 billion, mature.
 On Thursday, Mr. Ortiz promised that these foreign, mainly American-owned, bonds would be fully repaid to those who want to cash them in but that Mexico planned to offer owners longer-term dollar-indexed replacements that would pay attractive rates of interest.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rates Decline For New York Region

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Jobless rates in New York and New Jersey tumbled in December, falling to the lowest levels in several years in both New York City and New York State. But experts said the improved unemployment rates, while giving some cause for optimism in a region where the economy has lagged behind the healthy recovery experienced in most other parts of the nation, did not reflect a turnaround in the region's relatively poor performance recently.
 The December data may have been distorted by Christmas sales jobs and other temporary employment related to the holidays. 
 "Unless these numbers are confirmed with another month at the same level, we shouldn't make much of them," Rae D. Rosen, chief economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said. New York and New Jersey, she said, continued to trail the rest of the nation in economic growth.
 Indeed, while upstate New York appears to have benefited from a robust gain in jobs last month, the New York metropolitan area still looks as if it is not sharing in the gains being experienced in much of the nation.
 Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the New York Regional Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, who released the data for New York and New Jersey, said the improvement was spotty at best, and had bypassed New York City itself.
 "This does not translate into clear-cut improvement across the board," he said. "New York State did a little better, but it is difficult to contemplate a healthy regional economy without seeing growth in New York City."
 The clearest indicator of growth came not in unemployment rates, but in the number of people employed in New York State. Although employment, as measured by the survey of households, remained virtually unchanged in New Jersey, at 3.8 million jobs, and in New York City, at 3 million jobs, it rose sharply by 117,000 jobs, to 8.2 million, in New York State.
 Economists say the number of people who hold jobs is a better measure of economic activity than the unemployment rate, which is affected by vagaries like the number of people who become so discouraged that they stop looking for work. That portion of the working age population is not counted in the figures.
 The number of people who have dropped out of the working and job-seeking population may have grown in the region, particularly in New York City, Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
 "In the city, it's a case of fewer people looking for jobs, not more people getting them," he said. "That is not good news."
 Nonetheless, the December data showed that the unemployment rate plummeted across the rest of the state and in New Jersey. In New York State, the jobless rate was 5.4 percent -- the same as in the nation as a whole. New York State had a 6.3 percent unemployment rate in November.
 The monthly employment data are derived from a survey of people in 7,500 homes in New York and New Jersey. Connecticut is not included in the monthly survey, and no December data were available yesterday for that state.
 In New Jersey, the jobless rate sank to 6.1 percent in December, the lowest level since August, when it was 6 percent. New Jersey had 6.6 percent of its work force unemployed in November.
 In New York City, the December rate fell to 7.5 percent from 8.2 percent in November.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
MCI Venture With Paging Companies

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
MCI Communications plunged into the wireless communications business today, saying that it had signed agreements with Paging Network Inc. and the Skytel Corporation to provide nationwide messaging services.
 MCI had been searching for a wireless partner since a deal to buy a stake in Nextel Communications collapsed four months ago. By teaming with the Paging Network and Skytel, MCI hopes to become a big force in the wireless market, while bolstering its long-distance business. Pagenet, based in Dallas, is the largest paging company in the United States, with more than 4.1 million subscribers. Skytel, a unit of the Mobile Telecommunication Technologies Corporation, offers nationwide and international paging services, primarily to business customers. 
 MCI "doesn't want to be left out of the wireless revolution that is taking place," said Dorothy Salmon, paging analyst at Economic and Management Consultants International Inc., a market research firm. "They are trying to capitalize on their brand-name recognition."
 MCI, which is based here, declined to disclose financial details of the agreements.
 MCI said it would resell Pagenet and Skytel's paging services under the MCI brand name. MCI said on Thursday that it would begin offering a host of new communications services, including paging, E-mail and personal "800" toll-free services, under the MCI brand.
 MCI and AT&T are vying for large shares of the growing paging market, which has more than 22 million customers and posted $2.6 billion in revenue in 1993. The Personal Communications Industry Association, which represents paging companies, predicts that there will be 65 million paging subscribers in 2003.
 "MCI's goal is to provide, through one-stop shopping for consumers and businesses, an ever-broadening range of communication services under the MCI brand name," said Timothy F. Price, executive vice president and group president of MCI Communications Services.
 AT&T expanded its nationwide paging services last year through its acquisition of McCaw Cellular. AT&T also resells services provided by Skytel and Pagenet, a spokeswoman said.

HEADLINE: Stock Prices Advance Despite Report on Jobs

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market rose modestly in heavy trading yesterday, despite negative developments in the bond market and a plunge in AT&T, the nation's most widely held stock.
 The gain came even after the Labor Department reported the lowest unemployment rate in four years and strong numbers for job creation in December -- inflationary pressures that ought to have sent bond and stock prices tumbling. But traders said the job-creation figure of 256,000 was less than the 277,000 that some private economists had been expecting. 
 "The market seems to be running without a cause," said Tom Gallagher, head of equity trading at Oppenheimer & Company. "There is no strategy here."
 Richard Meyer, director of institutional trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann said: "Some guys are still out of town this week. The guys that are here are struggling to put their money to work."
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 16.49 points, to 3,867.41, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.34 point, to 460.68. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index advanced 4.03 points, to 749.69.
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above average, with 308.1 million shares changing hands, about 6 percent above last year's daily average of 290 million shares.
 Long-term interest rates fell, but the yield curve -- or the comparison of different interest rates among different maturities -- continued to flatten, a technical sign that short-term borrowing costs may be rising so high the rates could tip the economy into recession.
 As one indication of the flattening yield curve, the five-year note carried a higher interest rate than the 30-year bond, or 7.87 percent versus 7.86 percent, even though the long bond carries the higher risk and should carry the higher rate.
 While not uncommon when the Federal Reserve tightens short-term rates, stock traders normally regard a flattening yield curve as a negative for stocks, but they did not do so yesterday.
 At its most extreme, when the yield curve is said to "invert," the shortest-term borrowings yield far more than the long bond, and businesses find it difficult to get loans they can afford.
 Ten stocks lifted the Dow by one point or more for a total of nearly 28 points. The biggest gainer among this group was Aluminum Company of America, which rose 2 1/2, to 87 5/8. The surge was due in part to an Oppenheimer & Company analyst recommending Alcoa and other aluminum stocks on the basis of rising aluminum prices.
 International Paper, which rose 1 5/8, to 77, and Union Carbide, which gained 7/8, 30 1/4, also advanced because of the outlook for a continuing rise in paper and chemical prices.
 Computer stocks were also substantially aided by apparently unfounded speculation that Apple Computer might be acquired by Oracle, Matsushita Electric Industrial of Japan, and Philips Electronics of the Netherlands. Philips denied the report, first announced by Information Week magazine.
 Apple, the most active stock of the day at 9.6 million shares, rose 3 1/8, to 42. I.B.M. climbed 1 1/8, to 75 1/8, in part because a CS First Boston analyst raised his profit estimates for the computer giant.
 But six stocks dragged down the Dow by one point or more for a total of nearly 11 points. Chief among these stocks was AT&T, which at 5.5 million shares was the fifth-most- active stock of the session. It fell 1 3/8, to 48 1/4, in reaction to a new Sprint pricing plan for long-distance customers that traders and analysts said might touch off a price war.
 There was even more trading volume, some 7.4 million shares, for MCI Communications, the No.2 long-distance carrier. MCI fell 15/16 , to 18 1/16 . Sprint, whose pricing plan prompted the heavy trading, briefly established a 52-week low of 25 7/8 before closing at 27 1/8, up 1/2.
 The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.20 point, to 251.59, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,218 to 981. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.64 point, to 433.12.
 Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 15 rose, led by Alcoa. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 233 rose, led by I.B.M.
 In Tokyo, stocks ended the week lower. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed yesterday down 96.65 points, or half of 1 percent, at 19,519.46.

Market Quiet On Possible Cable Deal

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
Wall Street showed little reaction yesterday to reports that Time Warner Inc. was looking to acquire Cablevision Industries, a cable television company with 1.3 million subscribers.
 Time Warner stock fell 25 cents yesterday, closing at $34.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. Cablevision is closely held and its stock is not traded. 
 Time Warner has indicated interest in adding cable subscribers, and those served by Cablevision are primarily in New York, North Carolina and Florida, where Time Warner also has subscribers. In merging the two operations, Time Warner, the nation's second-largest cable company, would be able to "cluster," or benefit from economies of scale.
 The Wall Street Journal said yesterday that a deal for Cablevision, which is based in Liberty, N.Y., could total $2.5 billion to $3 billion.
 An executive close to Time Warner cautioned that no formal deal had been worked out and that discussions were continuing. "We would like to have a structure that would allow us to enlarge our cluster and keep the debt off the balance sheet," the executive said.
 It was unclear yesterday how such an acquisition would be financed by Time Warner, which has much debt as a result of the merger that created the company in 1990. Some analysts, including Edward Hatch of UBS Securities, said they were leery of the giant media company taking on more debt.
 One possible outcome would be a restructuring of Time Warner Entertainment, the venture that is 25 percent owned by U S West, with 5.6 percent stakes owned by the Toshiba Corporation and the Itochu Corporation. Those companies might put more equity into the venture, which owns the company's cable interests as well as Home Box Office and Warner Brothers.
 Analysts disagreed yesterday on whether additional cable ownership, which requires heavy capital investment, was a wise move for Time Warner. Jessica Reif, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said she liked the concept of Time Warner expanding in cable. But another analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he believed Time Warner had already invested enough in cable.

HEADLINE: Rate Rises To Cost PNC $190 Million

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The PNC Bank Corporation said yesterday that it would cost about $190 million before taxes to bail out some of its huge money-losing bets on interest rates that it made in recent years.
 It will lose $121 million from the sale of $1.8 billion of bonds on which prices have declined, resulting in an after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of $79 million. It will also spend $70 million this year to buy financial instruments known as derivatives that will increase in value if interest rates rise. The bank, based in Pittsburgh, hopes that these hedges will help offset the further losses it faces from rising interest rates. 
 In an effort to reduce its vulnerability in the future to interest rate swings, the bank also said that it would shrink its $64 billion in assets by 17 percent over the next two years.
 At the same time, PNC announced that it would buy back up to 10 percent of its stock in a move to bolster its share price.
 Many banks use bond investments and various derivatives to help bolster their earnings when interest rates fall and loan demand declines. But the sudden and sharp rise in interest rates last year caught a lot of banks by surprise. A derivative is a financial instrument whose value depends on the course of interest rates or other financial markets.
 A number of other regional banks, including Keycorp, based in Cleveland, and Banc One, based in Columbus, Ohio, have also announced losses from investments that were hurt because rates moved up far more than expected. Banc One, for example, said in November that it would take an after-tax charge of $170 million to cover losses on bond sales.
 While the loss numbers may look large, bank analysts argue that they can overstate the cost of rising rates. This is because banks earn greater profits investing funds in their interest-free checking accounts when rates rise.
PNC's losses are proportionally the biggest of any large bank. As of Sept. 30, the unrealized losses on the bank's $22 billion in bonds and $12 billion in derivatives totaled $1.5 billion, or 34 percent of its equity. The unrealized losses at Keycorp and Banc One, by contrast, were 20 percent of their equity.
 The bank faces the choice of selling these investments and taking the actual loss or keeping them until they mature and earning a below-market interest rate. In November, PNC disclosed that these positions would depress its interest earnings by 15 percent over the next few years if interest rates rose according to its projections. If rates go up more than the bank expects, its interest revenue would fall by an additional 10 percent.
 The moves announced by the bank yesterday were aimed at cutting this potential 10 percent drop in interest income to 5 percent. PNC is the country's 12th-largest banking company, with $64 billion in assets. More than one-third of those assets, however, are in bond investments, a much higher proportion than most banks. The bank plans to reduce its bond holdings by an additional $4.2 billion this year and $3 billion to $3.5 billion in 1996, in addition to the $1.8 billion it has already sold. And it will sell $2 billion in low-margin commercial loans.
 The bank also said that it would take an additional charge in the fourth quarter of $31 million, after taxes, to cover the costs of closing branches and opening new bank-by-phone services. PNC has said it plans to close as many as 30 percent if its branches over the next three years to cut costs, the most aggressive branch closing plan of any major bank in the country.
 While many banks have been buying back their stock, PNC's plan to acquire 10 percent of its shares is unusually large. Banks such as PNC have become quite profitable in the last two years and thus have been generating excess capital that they cannot deploy in the slow-paced banking industry.
 The company's stock closed at $22.125, down 75 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares have risen from a low of $20 in the days after its November disclosure.

The Economy
 
Job growth surged in December as a robust economy continued to churn out new jobs. The gains extended across the nation, and the unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent, the lowest since July 1990. Another sign of strength was a broadly based 54,000 jump in manufacturing jobs. [Page 1.]
 
In New York and New Jersey, the job market also improved But experts said the improvement did not reflect a turnaround in the region's economy. [50.]
 
The computer is on the verge of overtaking the television set as the chief electronics product in the home. Indeed, based on the products shown at an industry trade show, the TV set is rapidly becoming a computer as digital technology is used in televisions and video recorders and combination TV-telephones. [39.]
 
 
Companies
 
Fears that the price war in long-distance telephone services would escalate roiled the shares of AT&T and MCI. Wall Street's fears were prompted by a move by Sprint to offer a flat price, which was seen as a radical departure from pricing cloaked behind complex, heavily promoted discount schemes. Sprint's shares rose. [39.]
 
PNC Bank will take a $79 million charge as part of an effort to get out of some money-losing bonds. The company will also spend $70 million to invest in derivatives that it hopes will help offset further losses it faces from rising interest rates. [39.]
 
A battle for the breakfast tables of Europe is being waged by Kellogg and General Mills. Despite their rivalry, the two cereal companies welcome the growth overseas as a respite from cut-throat price wars and lackluster gains at home. [39.]
 
Ralston Purina will sell the maker of Wonder bread and Hostess Twinkies to Interstate Bakeries in a deal valued as much as $560 million. The sale of Continental Baking would make Interstate the largest bakery company in the nation. [41.]
 
Shares of Apple Computer jumped in very heavy trading on a report that said Oracle, Matsushita and Philips had discussed acquiring Apple. Philips dismissed the report as "nonsense.' [41.]
 
A report that Time Warner was looking to acquire Cablevision Industries was shrugged off by Wall Street. [41.]
 
 
International
 
Mexico's Finance Minister asked the I.M.F. for a new loan that would effectively add $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion to the country's monetary reserves in an effort to revive confidence in the Mexican economy and stabilize the peso. [39.]
 
 
Markets
 
Stocks gained, with particularly heavy trading in computer and long-distance stocks. The S.& P. 500 rose 0.34 point. [40.]
 
Treasury prices recovered from an early decline. [48.]
 
The dollar advanced, helped by expectations of higher interest rates and by intensified fighting in Chechnya. [49.]
 
Gold prices continued to slide. Natural gas prices fell. [49.]
 
 
Your Money
 
Money managers are sticking with their stock and bond funds for the most part, despite sharp losses last year. Five mutual fund experts who created hypothetical retirement portfolios are making few, if any, changes in their investments. [36.]
 
Can computer stocks repeat last year's dazzling performance? Much depends on whether consumer demand for CD-ROM software and home computing products remains strong enough to offset a weak market for business computers. [36.]
 
Refinancing adjustable-rate mortgages may make sense for people who want a larger loan or to consolidate debt. [37.]

HEADLINE: Five Portfolios Lose But Hold to Course

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
Time to close the book on 1994, the worst year ever for bond funds and a losing one for stock funds as well.
 Statements will soon arrive telling individual investors of the carnage, undoubtedly causing many people to consider a leap out of mutual funds into safe investments like short-term Treasuries and bank deposits, whose yields are much more attractive than a year ago. 
 Professional money managers, though, are holding onto their stock and bond funds and urging their clients to do the same. Market timing, they say, is a game that few people can ever win.
 Like many individual investors, the five mutual fund experts who created hypothetical retirement portfolios a year and a half ago for The New York Times all had losses for the quarter and a poor year. None of them, though, are making wholesale changes for 1995. At most, they are dropping a weak performer and adding a few new funds.
 John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, in Chicago, noted that his portfolio was skewed toward funds that invest in small stocks, a group that trailed last year.
 "I'm not going to get tricky and swap into larger companies," Mr. Rekenthaler said. "I'm willing to hold through the tougher period."
 Eric Kobren, editor of Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter in Wellesley, Mass., said his portfolio suffered because of its heavy holdings in cyclical stocks, which rise and fall with the economy.
 "A lot of investors bailed out of these funds thinking that rising interest rates will put a crimp in economic growth," Mr. Kobren said. "While we certainly don't dispute that relationship, we believe the economy remains healthy and commodity prices will rise further. We're sticking to our guns."
 Among the several dozen funds in the portfolios, the biggest loser in the final quarter of the year was the Pimco Institutional Emerging Markets fund chosen by Harold Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla. Largely because of its heavy Mexican exposure, the fund fell 18 percent in the period.
 "I expect my manager to perform as that sector of the economy does," Mr. Evensky said. "I'm not a market timer, and I believe that I should have money in that sector, so I'm going to stay with it."
 To explain why these financial advisers do not try to time the market, investors need only look at some data provided by Townley Capital Management of New York. A study it commissioned from the University of Michigan shows how just a few market-timing mistakes can destroy performance.
 An investment of $100 in the stock market at the beginning of 1963 would have earned $2,330 by the end of 1993. But if the investor was out of the market for the best 90 days in that period, the earnings would have been just $110, concluded H. Nejat Seyhun, a finance professor at Michigan. The annualized return, Dr. Seyhun calculated, would have fallen from 11.8 percent to 3.3 percent.
 So anyone who gets skittish and pulls out of stocks in favor of cash at the wrong time can do irreparable harm. Likewise, loading up on certain industries and getting out of others can mean missing surges in the unpredictable financial markets.
 For a far-off goal like retirement, financial advisers generally recommend creating a growth portfolio and making minor adjustments based on a periodic review.
 Among the five advisers who created retirement portfolios in mid-1993, Mr. Jacobs remains the overall leader. His portfolio has gained 15.1 percent since its inception, in spite of last quarter's 2.3 percent drop.
 The best performer in the last quarter of the year was Jack A. Brill, a San Diego investment adviser who specializes in "socially responsible" investing. His portfolio lost 1.5 percent, bringing his cumulative return to 4.8 percent. For the full year, the only gainer was Mr. Kobren, who gained 1.8 percent in 1994 and raised his total return to 11.1 percent.
 Since tracking began on July 7, 1993, the five portfolios have risen an average of 8.6 percent, compared with a 7.47 percent total return for the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index. As individuals, though, only Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Kobren have beaten the market.
 The portfolio performance, tracked quarterly by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. in Summit, N.J., excludes transaction costs, sales charges and taxes, since many people invest retirement money in tax-deferred accounts. The five experts can choose among funds open to new investors and can change them quarterly, although the portfolios are intended to grow for 20 years.
 Among the three financial advisers who adjusted their portfolios, no clear pattern emerges. One is moving toward a growth style of investing, which favors companies with rapid earnings growth, and one is adding some value funds, which tend to buy stocks that the managers consider cheap. Mr. Evensky, whose cumulative return is 7.3 percent, and Mr. Rekenthaler, with a gain of 4.8 percent, are standing pat.
 For the "socially responsible" investor -- who tends to avoid companies involved in gaming, tobacco, alcohol, nuclear weapons and similar concerns -- 10 funds have made their debut since Mr. Brill put his portfolio together. Taking advantage of this new-found choice, Mr. Brill is adding two value-oriented funds, Neuberger & Berman Socially Responsive Fund and MMA Praxis Growth Fund, which has ties to the Mennonite Church.
 Falling by the wayside is Progressive Environmental, a sector fund that "has been heavily hammered because the group itself is out of favor," he said. It was the only domestic fund in any of the portfolios to take a double-digit percentage hit in the last quarter. Mr. Brill is also dropping Working Assets Citizens Balanced, which keeps a portion of its assets in bonds, to reduce the portion of his assets that are sensitive to interest rate movements.
 The most aggressive investor of the group, Mr. Jacobs made several changes to increase his portfolio's risk level. He added Janus Mercury and the Yacktman Fund, both classified as growth funds, and deleted Neuberger & Berman Guardian, a value fund. He switched Europe funds, upgrading to a better performer. T. Rowe Price European Stock, which rose 4.1 percent in 1994, replaces Invesco European, which fell 3 percent.
 The keeper of the all-Fidelity portfolio, Mr. Kobren, is adding a new fund in that family. It is Fidelity Export, which buys stocks of American companies with heavy foreign sales. Such companies should profit from the global trade accord and the European economic recovery, he said. The fund supplants International Growth and Income, which has a big stake in bonds.
 Unlike the other managers, Mr. Kobren keeps his portfolio to less than half a dozen funds. People buy funds to simplify their lives, so "I like to keep it simple," he explained. "I don't mind using three funds, even if it's a $500,000 account."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Sags, With Contract Tumbling 3% in Just a Week

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Gold prices tumbled yesterday after an unemployment report bolstered expectations for another increase in interest rates.
 Other precious metals also fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange, extending a decline. 
 Gold and other precious metals are considered hedges against the effects of accelerating inflation. But the Federal Reserve is expected to raise short-term interest rates again at the end of the month, and such anti-inflationary measures reduce investor demand for gold.
 On other markets, warmer weather forecasts drove natural gas prices to a three-and-a-half-month low. Hog prices also dropped. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities fell 0.60 point, to 235.24.
 Gold for February delivery, the most actively traded contract, sagged $4.40, to $372.20 a troy ounce. The contract has lost $12.20, or 3 percent, since last Friday. March silver plunged 8 cents, to $4.652 a troy ounce; April platinum fell $4.10, to $406.40 a troy ounce.
 George Milling-Stanley, precious metals analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc., said speculators saw no reason to invest in gold.
 "It's a case of 'What's gold done for me this year,' " he said. "It's gone down 3 percent already. Why own it?"
 Speculators also sold gold in anticipation of lower prices in the months ahead, said Ian MacDonald, manager of precious metals trading at the New York branch of the Swiss bank Credit Suisse.
 Gold prices typically decline in the first quarter, he said, as jeweler demand diminishes after the holiday push. Middle Eastern buying also dries up during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which corresponds to February this year.
 February deliveries of natural gas fell 5.3 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange to $1.499 for 1,000 cubic feet, the lowest daily settlement for near-term deliveries since Sept. 23.
 Prices for the heating fuel have fallen sharply all week, despite frigid temperatures in the Midwest and Northeast, because of abundant supplies, analysts said. The American Gas Association reported on Wednesday that natural gas in storage was 8 percent above a year ago.
 "Some cold weather this week is not enough to sustain a rally in this market," said George Ellis, a trader at GSC Energy in Atlanta.

HEADLINE: MORTGAGES;
When It Makes Sense To Trade In Adjustables

BYLINE: By Nick Ravo 

 BODY:
PEOPLE with adjustable-rate mortgages are feeling the pinch as rising interest rates push their monthly payments higher. And oddly enough, some of these homeowners are coping by refinancing into another adjustable-rate loan, well aware that their rates could rise again.
 The prime candidates are people who want to take out a larger mortgage to pay for education, home improvements or other big-ticket items and those who want to consolidate existing debt like a home equity loan. 
 Harry LeFevre, an assistant principal who lives in Amawalk, N.Y., just refinanced a loan adjustable once a year that he had since February 1992. He did so because the rate on both his mortgage and his home equity loan were set to rise two percentage points, to almost 10.25 percent and 11.25 percent, respectively.
 By waiting so long to refinance, he missed out on the bottom in interest rates last year, he conceded. But he had to complete his extensive home renovations first. Lenders generally resist making home loans at attractive rates until such work is done. "I was also too busy and since my loan anniversary date was February, I felt I had some time," he said.
 Mr. LeFevre's previous loan was for $180,000 at an initial rate of 4.25 percent with a monthly payment of $1,385, including about $500 in tax and insurance. Over the last two years, though, the rate had increased to 8.25 percent and the payments to $1,626. In February, the payments could have risen to $1,866.
 Mr. LeFevre's new loan is for the outstanding mortgage amount plus $40,000 rolled over from the home equity loan. The new loan starts at 5.875 percent, adjusts once a year and carries initial payments of $1,801 a month. The only fees he incurred, including a credit check and an appraisal, came to about $600.
 The risk of rising rates is limited since most adjustable loans can climb only two percentage points a year and six percentage points over their life, almost always 30 years. "My biggest risk is that if rates continue to increase they can now go as high as 11.875 instead of 10.25," Mr. LeFevre said, referring to the lifetime caps on the two loans.
 Bruce R. Lublin, president of the Homerica Mortgage Corporation, with offices in Harrison, N.Y., and Westport, Conn., said, "With prime rates going up, the people with home equity loans are looking to fix their costs, and this is a way to do it."
 Home refinancings are not as plentiful as they were in 1992 and 1993. They now account for less than 10 percent of new mortgages, according to HSH Associates, a mortgage research firm in Butler, N.J.
 Most refinancings are coming from homeowners with old mortgages at high fixed rates who are belatedly moving into a lower fixed-rate loan to reduce their payments, said Keith T. Gumbinger, an analyst with HSH. A few people with adjustable loans are refinancing into fixed-rate loans at a slightly higher rate because they fear rates will skyrocket. "We do have people who do refinance into A.R.M.'s, but the pool is pretty small," he said, pegging it at about 20 percent of refinancers.
 Not everyone doing it wants to consolidate debt. Mr. Lublin, for example, recently refinanced a mortgage on his new home in Greenwich, Conn. At first, he took over the previous owner's mortgage, an unusual three-year adjustable-rate loan that had climbed to 9 percent and had a lifetime cap of 15 percent. He immediately refinanced into a one-year adjustable loan at 4.25 percent. (Such a loan generally costs about one point, an origination fee equal to 1 percent of the loan amount.)
 Ellen Bitton, president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, a mortgage broker, said that interest in refinancing one adjustable for another has tapered off in the last few weeks as one-year rates have risen sharply. "There are, however, still some good short-term deals out there," she said.
 Homerica, for example, is offering a one-year adjustable at an initial rate of 5.125 percent, with a fee of two percentage points of the total.
 Mr. Gumbinger cautioned that refinancing into an adjustable loan might raise cash or restructure debt but it would not help retire a mortgage. "You aren't making a dent in your mortgage balance if you keep refinancing," he said. "You keep re-extending the term every year, and most of the early years of payments are mostly interest."
