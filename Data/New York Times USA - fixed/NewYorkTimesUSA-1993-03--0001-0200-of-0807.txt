HEADLINE: Yeltsin Suggests Russian Regional Role

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 28

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin suggested today that Russia should be granted special powers to stop ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet Union.
Mr. Yeltsin raised the notion only briefly at a political conference, in an address that was otherwise focused largely on his intensifying political confrontation with the Legislature. 
 But it was the President's first public intimation that Russia sought special military powers in the other 14 former Soviet republics, all of which have declared independence.
 
Sure to Raise Protests
 Any such suggestion was certain to raise ardent protests and anxieties, most notably in Ukraine and the three Baltic states, where anything that smacks of renewed domination by Moscow is political anathema. These and other republics would undoubtedly view any special powers as a dangerous license for Moscow to impose its will on the new states.
"The world community is increasingly coming to understand Russia's special responsibility in this difficult task," Mr. Yeltsin told a congress of the Civic Union, a center-right alliance.
"I think the moment has come when responsible international organizations, including the United Nations, should grant Russia special powers as a guarantor of peace and stability in the region of the former union. Russia has a heartfelt interest in stopping all armed conflicts on the territory of the former Soviet Union."
Mr. Yeltsin did not elaborate further. His reference was evidently to Tajikistan, the southern Caucasus region and Moldova, which have fallen into bloody ethnic strife and where Russian forces are still based.
[In Washington, a State Department official said it was important to see the full text of Mr. Yeltsin's remarks before jumping to any conclusions about what he meant.]
 In Tajikistan, Russian forces have openly stepped in to close the border with Afghanistan, across which guns and gunmen have been streaming. In the other struggles, the Russian troops have remained officially neutral but have been repeatedly accused of aiding one side or another.
Mr. Yeltsin's comments followed several developments on these fronts:
*In Tajikistan, Russians were reported to have fought a stiff battle with Afghan guerrillas.
*In Georgia, the Russian Defense Minister, General Pavel S. Grachev, paid a call on Russian forces despite the public opposition of President Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
*In Moldova, the commander of the 14th Russian Army said his units would not leave until the political status of the Trans-Dniester region -- where the Russian population has declared independence -- is clearly defined.
 
A Foreign Minority
 In these regions and in other former republics, some 25 million Russians have found themselves a foreign minority. The issue is especially sensitive in Latvia and Estonia, which have passed citizenship laws restricting the rights of Russians who have settled there since 1940.
While some warring republics have sought Russian intervention, especially in Central Asia, they have done so strictly within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the vague structure to which 11 former republics still technically belong. Kazakhstan, for example, recently objected to a Russian plan to take a leading role in regional peacekeeping.
Mr. Yeltsin's dominant theme in his address was the growing political confrontation with Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, the legislative leader, and the Russian Parliament. Charging that the Deputies were pushing Russia to ruin, he declared, "I, as President, cannot tolerate such a situation any longer."
In his first major comments on the subject since returning from a brief vacation, Mr. Yeltsin said that the Parliament was now virtually a "parallel government" blocking economic changes, and that it planned to encroach further on his executive powers through constitutional changes at the next session of the Congress of Peoples' Deputies.
 
Highest Authority
 Under the existing Soviet-era constitution, the 1,000 members of the Congress constitute the highest legal authority in the land, and Congress empowers a smaller sitting Parliament to legislate between its sessions, which are held twice a year. Mr. Khasbulatov is chairman of both Congress and Parliament.
"I did not swear my oath to such a constitution," Mr. Yeltsin declared. "They are talking about refusing to separate powers. If we refuse to separate powers we will get either dictatorship or anarchy, both of which would be ruinous for Russia."
This was the first time Mr. Yeltsin had questioned the legitimacy of the Constitution, but he made no specific threats.
Still, his harsh words contributed to the actions and statements that seem to be building to a major clash. Two weeks ago Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Khasbulatov agreed to negotiate a power-sharing agreement but nothing has come of the talks, and the statements of both have become increasingly aggressive.
The struggle dates from the Congress session in December, when the executive and legislative branches resolved a fiery confrontation by agreeing to hold a referendum on a new constitution in April. Since then, Mr. Khasbulatov and most other political leaders have declared themselves against a referendum at this time.
Mr. Yeltsin has suggested that he, too, would prefer not to hold a plebiscite, but he and his lieutenants have found themselves increasingly on the defensive. Though public-opinion polls still show Mr. Yeltsin to be the most popular politician, they also show some erosion in his standing. More damaging, the polls show that less than half the electorate would turn out for a referendum, denying him the one weapon he might have.

HEADLINE: Ex-Foes Trade Stories From Cold War Trenches

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., Feb. 27

 BODY:
Former United States and Soviet officials who helped end the cold war presented differing views of that watershed event at a conference here this weekend that brought together former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, former Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh and many colleagues from the 1980's.
But the last generation of cold warriors, who gathered at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, shared several perceptions. 
 In the Reagan-Gorbachev era, for instance, both superpowers were committed to arms buildups that they ultimately recognized as self-defeating.
 
Prompted by Chernobyl
 Both sides agreed that the Chernobyl reactor disaster, equivalent to only one-quarter of the blast from the smallest American nuclear weapon, gave a powerful impulse to disarmament.
They also said the personal relationship that Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev eventually built was critical to the diplomatic understandings they reached. "It created the human networks on both sides necessary for the disarmament agreements," said Anatoly S. Chernyaev, foreign policy adviser to President Gorbachev.
On the other hand for Mr. Bessmertnykh, who was Deputy Soviet Foreign Minister from 1986 to 1990 and Foreign Minister in 1991, the end of the cold war was really the end of a much longer period of ideological rivalry between East and West that had started with the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. Mr. Bessmertnykh said that the cold warwas in fact ended by reformers around Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Reagan who realized its wasteful futility.
For the conference this weekend, the Central Intelligence Agency declassified a top-secret estimate of the Soviet Union's nuclear capability in 1982-92.
 
Justifying the Buildup
 This document, drawn up in February 1983, helped to justify both the Reagan Administration's arms buildup and its drive toward nuclear disarmament. The assessment predicted that the Soviet arsenal of 2,300 land- and submarine-based missiles in 1983 would increase "by 13 to 25 percent over the next 10 years" and that the number of deployed warheads would rise from 7,300 to between 13,000 and 21,000 by the early 1990's.
But the predicted rise in Soviet nuclear power never came about, he said, because "we got an arms-reduction process going" and the new missiles were not built.
Mr. Bessmertnykh said the Soviet leadership had shared a similar view of Washington's military intentions at the start of the Reagan era. "The same story was reported to us by our intelligence," he said, "and after a period of accommodation the United States had suddenly changed course and started an enormous buildup."
For Mr. Shultz, what distinguished Mr. Reagan from many of his conservative supporters was that he disliked nuclear weapons and wanted to use America's military strength to negotiate reductions. "Reagan was different from many of his conservative backers in that he was a leader in saying the United States must be strong, but he parted company from them in saying we must negotiate with the Soviets on the basis of that strength," he said.
Mr. Reagan had great faith in his powers of personal persuasion, Mr. Shultz went on, saying that while he might call the Soviet Union "the evil empire," he also "believed he could turn it into a good empire."
Mr. Bessmertnykh said the buildup under President Reagan caused difficulties for Mr. Gorbachev, whose arrival in power in 1985 had coincided with growing economic problems for the Soviet Union.
These difficulties were compounded by the Reagan Administration's interest in developing a Strategic Defense Initiative anti-missile shield, which Moscow saw as destabilizing because it meant the United States had less to fear from a retaliatory Soviet strike if it struck the Soviet Union first.
This led, he said, to a tug-of-war inside the Soviet bureaucracy, with the military wanting better missiles to counter "star wars" and the enemies of the cold war seeking to use the threat of a renewed arms race to push arms curbs.
The United States speakers at the conference seemed to take "star wars" less seriously. "I never believed in it," said a former Defense Secretary, Frank R. Carlucci. Mr. Shultz said the Strategic Defense Initiative was "driven by Ronald Reagan, very personal," adding that as Secretary of State, the Pentagon once refused him a briefing on "star wars" because he did not have the right security clearance.

HEADLINE: 2 Bosnian Opponents Balk At Beginning U.N. Parley

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Feb. 28

 BODY:
On the eve of a critical round of peace talks, leaders of two warring Bosnian factions signaled today that they were not yet prepared to accept the terms of a United Nations settlement.
Negotiations on ending the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina are expected to get under way here on Monday. Radovan Karadzic, head of the Bosnian Serbs, arrived in the United States today but rejected an invitation to begin talks this afternoon with former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance, who is the United Nations mediator, and Lord Owen, who represents the European Community. 
 President Alija Izetbegovic, head of the Muslim-led Government of Bosnia, who failed to attend the first round of peace talks here in early February, also disappointed the mediators by saying he planned to remain in Washington through Monday meeting with Clinton Administration officials and members of Congress.
 
Reluctance to Join Talks
 His reluctance to join the peace talks reinforced the mediators' fears that he still is not fully committed to a reaching a settlement on the basis of the Vance-Owen plan, which calls for Bosnia to be divided into 10 semiautonomous provinces.
Most of the provinces would virtually be ethnic enclaves dominated by Serbs, Croats or Muslims, and so far only the Bosnian Croats have accepted its terms. The Bosnian Government has asserted that the plan would reward the Serbs for a 10-month pattern of "ethnic cleansing" in which thousands of Muslims have been driven from their homes.
The mediators are convinced that the leaders of Bosnian factions will not return for any further negotiations if they fail to sign a peace settlement in the next few days. The launching today of an American airdrop of relief supplies in eastern Bosnia has lent a renewed urgency to the mediators' efforts. In authorizing the air mission, President Clinton said he hoped that it would improve the climate for negotiations among the Serbs and Muslims, who officially blame each other for the suffering of civilians in villages cut off by the fighting.
But both Mr. Mr. Izetbegovic and Mr. Karadezic appear reluctant to get down to serious discussions quickly on the peace plan.
 
Expected a Week Ago
 Both leaders were originally expected in New York a week ago for a second round of peace talks after an earlier visit. But Mr. Karadzic failed to arrive, saying he was worried by legal action brought against him in the United States for abuses of human rights in Bosnia. He also balked at restrictions placed on his movements by the Clinton Administration as a result of allegations that he is a war criminal.
President Izetbegovic also refused to show up unless several conditions were met, including an end to the Serbian blockade of United Nations aid convoys trying to reach besieged Muslim villages in eastern Bosnia as well as enforcement of a United Nations ban on Serbian flights over Bosnia.
Even now, he contends that he is only offering to stop briefly at the New York talks later this week on his way home from an official visit to Washington. Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Foreign Minister, is still described as the delegation's official leader. But Mr. Karadzic has said he will only negotiate with President Izetbegovic.
 
Hopes for Security Council
 After five months of talks in Geneva, the mediators decided to move the negotiations to the United Nations in New York at the start of the year in the hope that the Security Council would corner the leaders into accepting their peace plan.
Officials here say the difficulty of persuading the Serbian and Muslim leaders to come to New York and talk seriously has convinced the mediators that they now have at best only a few days to reach an agreement.
The mediators doubt that the factional leaders will ever agree to return to New York again if they depart without making peace this time. The Security Council is threatening Serbia and Montenegro, the remaining republics of the old Yugoslav federation, with an even tougher economic embargo unless the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosovic, uses his influence with Bosnia's Serbs to make peace.
The Clinton Administration, which had earlier criticized the Vance-Owen plan as favoring the Serbs, has since appointed a special envoy to help the peace negotiations along. An envoy has also been sent by Russia, the only major power outside the Balkans to show sympathy for the Serbian point of view.
Mr. Karadjic is viewed as being closer to accepting the Vance-Owen plan than President Izetbegovic, who believes that the Muslims' weak military position on the ground condemns them to unfair terms in any peace settlement.
In an effort to make their proposals more appealing to the Muslims, Mr. Vance and Lord Owen are planning to offer them several revisions, officials here say. Originally the Vance-Owen plan called for both sides to pull back their heavy weapons after a cease-fire and collect them in designated areas. A United Nations peacekeeping force would be deployed to monitor compliance with this requirement.
The Muslims, who are short of heavy weapons, have already said they want stronger guarantees that the Serbs will not start using their artillery again. And the mediators now plan to ask the United Nations forces to take physical control of all heavy weaponry.
 
NATO's 10-Year Plan
 This has become feasible, officials say, because NATO wants to send up to 40,000 peacekeeping soldiers for as long as 10 years rather than the 25,000 the mediators originally suggested.
The mediators are also considering asking the United Nations Secretary General to appoint an American general to command the new peacekeeping force, with a European civilian official put in charge of the plan's political and relief aspects.
Mediators hope the proposed appointment of an American field commander will reassure the Muslims, who have found the Clinton Administration more sympathetic to their plight than was the Bush Administration or the European governments, who all supported the original Vance-Owen plan.
Finally, the mediators are willing to add additional land to two of the three provinces in which their peace plan calls for Muslims to be dominant.

HEADLINE: Savings Bonds' Rate Cut

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The 6 percent guaranteed minimum rate on United States Government savings bonds is being lowered to 4 percent, effective Monday, the Treasury Department has announced.
The Treasury said on Saturday that outstanding series E and EE savings bonds and savings notes would carry the previously guaranteed minimum rates until the end of their original maturity periods or current extended maturity periods. 
 The same schedule applies to the rates on series H and HH savings bonds: Outstanding bonds will carry current rates, but those issued after March 1 will carry the guaranteed 4 percent minimum.
The Treasury said the rate reduction is in response to substantial declines in market interest rates in the last few months.
The last change in the guaranteed minimum rate was on Nov. 1, 1986, when it fell to 6 percent, from 7.5 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. Quit Collecting Health Data Sought by Clinton

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
In a setback for President Clinton's effort to control health costs, Federal officials have discovered that the Government no longer collects the data needed to set a health budget for each state, as Mr. Clinton promised to do in the 1992 campaign.
The discovery forecloses one method of controlling health costs and forces the Clinton Administration to seek other ways of achieving the same goal, perhaps through direct Federal regulation of prices in the health-care industry. 
 In the campaign, Mr. Clinton said he would set a national limit on all health spending, public and private. Under the overall limit, he said, the Federal Government would set a health-care budget for each state and give the states maximum flexibility in deciding how to control costs and provide coverage for the uninsured. A state would be free to design its own solutions, as long as it stayed within its budget. The state budgets were to be computed from current health spending adjusted for population changes, inflation and other factors.
 
Data Collected Until 1982
 But members of the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform, headed by Hillary Rodham Clinton, discovered last week that the Government quit collecting state-by-state data on health spending a decade ago.
The Federal Government tabulated health spending by state from 1966 through 1982, but has not compiled state data since then, apparently because Federal officials did not need such information to run the Medicare and Medicaid programs for the elderly and the poor.
Thus, the study group members said, it will be virtually impossible to establish for each state a reasonable budget that can withstand legal challenge.
At the moment, they said, states have no reliable way to keep track of health spending outside public programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Federal, state and local programs account for less than half of all health spending.
 
Large Variations Among States
 Lynn M. Etheredge, a health economist working for the President's task force, said: "We have no ability to track spending at the state level, let alone set budgets in a rational way. Even our national spending estimates are two to three years behind. It's easy to put together a numbers exercise and just say health care will be X percent of gross domestic product. But how, in fact, do you budget 14 percent of our economy? How do you make this work? The practicalities are overwhelming."
The 1982 data showed that states varied immensely in the level of spending for health care, the growth of such spending and the mix of services bought with health-care dollars. Per capita spending for health care in 1982 ranged from a low of $857 in South Carolina to a high of $1,508 in Massachusetts. California and New York ranked second and third, with per capita spending of more than $1,400 each.
White House officials said Mr. Clinton was likely to propose health spending goals and new techniques for collecting data, but not a firm budget for each state.
In the absence of reliable data on state health spending, Administration officials are seeking other ways to control costs. Confidential work papers of the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform show it is considering a wide range of "interim cost controls," including Federal limits on doctors' fees, hospital charges and private health insurance premiums. But White House officials insist that these controls will be temporary.
In addition, Paul Starr, a professor of sociology at Princeton University who is working at the White House, proposed this month that states limit the average premium paid for each person in a health insurance plan or a health maintenance organization. The payment, he said, could be set to limit total spending in each state.
 
One-Seventh of Economy
 Health spending now accounts for one-seventh of the nation's entire economy. The Department of Health and Human Services estimates national health spending each year using data from a variety of sources.
For example, the American Hospital Association provides data on hospital spending. The Internal Revenue Service provides data on doctors' incomes. Commerce Department agencies, including the Census Bureau, estimate spending for drugs and nursing homes.
But for the last decade, the Government has been making yearly estimates of nationwide health spending without trying to compute outlays in each state.
 
Large Difficulties Foreseen
 In the campaign, Mr. Clinton said he would provide health care for all Americans and curb health costs with a strategy known as "managed competition," under which doctors, hospitals and insurance companies form networks and compete for the business of large employee groups and other consumers.
Mr. Etheredge, an architect of managed competition, said it would be very difficult for Federal authorities to enforce a health budget for each state.
"I know it sounds like a simple idea," he said. "But let's just remember the Gramm-Rudman law. We set a target for the Federal Government to balance its budget. We missed by $350 billion. The Federal Government has a tremendous amount of knowledge about its programs and complete control, in principle, over its revenues and outlays. Trying to control the health-care system is going to be much more difficult than controlling the Federal budget."
Administration officials say they have discovered another potential problem with managed competition. In the first five years, they said, it will probably not produce savings for the Government and therefore will not provide the Treasury with the money needed to subsidize coverage for the uninsured. The savings, if any, will show up in later years and will be spread among consumers, private employers and private health insurers.
 
Other Limits Are Likely
 But a White House official said Mr. Clinton could propose new taxes to "recapture some of the savings" that private employers realize. The Administration is also looking for new ways to slow the growth of Medicaid, perhaps by changing the legal formula to reduce Federal payments to the states for the care of poor people.
In addition, Administration officials said they might ask Congress to eliminate special Medicaid payments to hospitals serving "a disproportionate number of low-income patients." Such payments total $16.5 billion this year, or 12 percent of expected Federal and state Medicaid outlays.
Federal officials say they do not completely understand why health spending varies so much from state to state. Experts have documented wide variations in the practice style of doctors in different parts of the country, with doctors in some states much more likely to prescribe hospital care and costly procedures.
Health spending is also affected by the ratio of doctors to the local population. But even more important is the mix of general-practice doctors and specialists. Health costs tend to be higher in places with large numbers of specialists.

CRISIS AT THE TWIN TOWERS: STEALTHY DETONATION AND PUBLIC CHAOS
As officials announced that the twin towers of the World Trade Center would be closed at least seven days from the effects of Friday's bomb blast, executives and workers turned their aplomb and ingenuity to finding ways to carry on business. The five commodities exchanges are reopening in a smaller building and big brokerage houses have arranged alternative locations. But other tenants face uncertainty and possible large financial losses, even though state and city officials do not expect lasting economic damage or a flight of panicked tenants. A1.
BOMB REPORTED MADE OF DYNAMITE
Law-enforcement officials say that the bomb that devastated the World Trade Center apparently was made of conventional dynamite, not a tightly controlled military explosive like the plastic favored by terrorists. And Police Commissioner Kelly disclosed that investigators believe more than one person was involved. A1.
SUDDEN TRAUMA AND SLOW RECOVERY
As they gain a clearer sense of the obstacles they face, from the lack of heat to water in the basement, Port Authority officials say it will be more than a week before the World Trade Center is fully revived. B5.
Since attention is a main goal of terrorism, investigators are baffled by the silence following the explosion. None of the more than 50 callers who have claimed responsibility has presented convincing proof. B4.
Eight years ago, an anti-terrorist task force told the Port Authority that the trade center's parking garage was vulnerable to a bomb attack and should be closed to the public. Additional safety systems were also suggested. But most of the key recommendations were never adopted. B5.
With a tiny blue hard hat perched atop his head, Stanley Brezenoff has been forced to occupy the very hot seat at the helm of the disaster reaction effort. His long experience in city government has proven to be good training. B4.

NEW YORK CITY
 
WINNERS AND LOSERS ON ST. PATRICK'S DAY
A Federal judge's decision about the sponsorship of this year's St. Patrick's Day Parade appears to hand total victory to the Ancient Order of Hibernians, giving them control of the parade on their own terms, and equally complete defeat to Mayor Dinkins and the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization. But on closer inspection the lines between winners and losers become blurred in the shifting ethnic and political mix of New York City. B3.
LIBERAL IMAGE IN DISPUTE
A larger proportion of New Yorkers now own their homes or apartments than at any other time in the 20th century. Owners tend to be more politically conservative than renters, which may help explain the city's recent conflicts over traditional social values. Metro Matters, B3.
A foundation fills the wishes of hundreds of seriously ill children. B2.

HOSPITALS NO, BUT JOBS YES
As New York State struggles to close down its sprawling mental hospitals and move the resources into smaller community programs, legislators who favor the policy in theory sometimes balk when it means loss of funds to their home districts.

HEADLINE: The South Rises Again, Now as a Tourist Haven

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GULF SHORES, Ala.

 BODY:
Until a few years ago not many people north of Mobile had heard of this town on the Gulf of Mexico, much less thought of coming to vacation on its white beaches. But as people spread the word of a Florida-like beach resort in a state that proclaims itself "the heart of Dixie," even Yankee tourists began arriving in droves.
Today, almost four million visitors a year descend on Gulf Shores and neighboring Orange Beach, the only two cities on Alabama's 32-mile Gulf Coast. 
 That is about a million more than the total yearly visitors to Palm Beach, West Palm Beach and Boca Raton, on Florida's tonier and more expensive Gold Coast. And they are arriving here on everything from tour buses from as far away as Lincoln, Neb., to campers from the Midwest and New England.
"We'd never been in Alabama before," said Don De Nagy of Simsbury, Conn. "Then we heard about this place and decided it was worth looking at someplace different."
Intrigued, he and his wife, Doe, drove down in mid-February with a camper in tow, and on their first day here they were already checking out the four 18-hole courses.
Tourists from all over the nation have been visiting the South in growing numbers for a decade, coming not just to Florida's beaches and theme parks, but also in search of historic Dixie and mythical Dogpatch.
 
Bullish on the South
 Now, with the economy looking up -- and with a nudge expected because Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Al Gore of Tennessee occupy the highest offices in the land -- all signs point to a record 1993.
"Everywhere you look across the South, tourist fever is building," said Bud Flora, director of travel and tourism for Southern Living magazine. "Unless we get a hellacious user tax on gasoline, all the pieces are in place for the strongest tourism year ever."
That optimism is shared by tourist officials from Virginia to Louisiana because of an unusual confluence of circumstances. One of the most important is that with lower prices and many of its destinations within two days' drive of almost half the United States population, the South is the major beneficiary of the recent shift to shorter and less expensive vacations, closer to home.
"It's going to be a banner year for the South," said George Smith, director of tourism development in Mississippi, "and this state will surpass anything we've ever seen."
 
An Advertising Jackpot
 That optimism arises from the prospects of a $5 million advertising and promotion budget this year, made possible by a mother lode of money available because of taxes collected from Mississippi's six new dockside casinos. Aboard the riverboat President Casino in Biloxi one night in mid-February, Shirley and Ted Westfall from Ossipee, N.H., were busily feeding the slot machines after a nine-hour drive from central Florida. "We love to gamble," Mr. Westfall said, "so it's either here or the Bahamas."
The economic impact of tourism is especially pronounced in the South, where it is the first or second industry in each state as well as a leading source of employment. In Florida alone, sales taxes paid by tourists -- $4.7 million a day -- account for 20 percent of the total state budget. And here in Baldwin County, tourism to Gulf Beach generates more lodging tax than any of the other 66 counties in the state.
The South has long been a popular destination, especially Florida, which draws more than 39 million tourists a year, up from 22.9 million in 1982. But neighboring states have become adept at coaxing Florida-bound visitors to spend a night or a week with them.
 
Golf as Growth Industry
 "Many of our visitors are on their way to or from Florida," said Hanna Ledford, deputy commissioner of tourism in Georgia, "but that's an advantage to us, because we're getting them to spend a few days en route."
With thousands of golf courses, including more than 475 in North Carolina, golf is now a year-round activity in much of the South, to the benefit of hotels and restaurants that once closed for the winter. "It's nothing to see a husband and wife drive down here from the North on a Saturday, play golf Saturday and Sunday, then climb back in their car or truck and drive home," said Marion Edmonds, director of tourism for South Carolina.
That mobility, enjoyed also by hunters and fishermen, has improved with the completion of interstate highways.
At the same time, airport hubs in Atlanta; Charlotte, N.C.; Nashville, Orlando, Fla.; and Raleigh-Durham, N.C., have heightened name recognition among millions of passengers, making it easier to lure them back as tourists.
 
In Search of Scarlett
 Many Southern states have opened tourist offices in other countries, and foreigners are showing up everywhere: national parks in Tennessee, Revolutionary and Civil War battlefields in Virginia and Dixieland clubs in New Orleans.
Along with Americans, many Japanese tourists are following a "Tara Road" tour through the South, tracing the footpaths that Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler trod -- or would have, had they not been imaginary characters of Margaret Mitchell. (The house where she wrote "Gone With the Wind" is part of the tour.)
Soon to open for its eighth season, Dollywood in Pigeon Fork, Tenn., the recreated 1880's Smoky Mountains village representing the inspiration for many of Dolly Parton's songs, expects to exceed two million visitors.
Many Southern states and resorts are being advertising in national magazines or on cable television, often for the first time. Most states are also focusing on Canadians, some 2.4 million of whom spend about $2 billion in Florida each year.
Southern tourism this year will also benefit from well-placed friends. "We spent 20 years trying to get Arkansas on the map; then Bill Clinton was able to do it in 15 months," said Joe David Rice, the state director of tourism.
 
Battlefields and Birdwatching
 Even before the Presidential campaign, Arkansas was banking on a strong 1993, thanks in large part to Governor Clinton's support in 1989 of a 2 percent tax on lodging and attractions that provided money for promoting the state.
"Before now we just didn't have money to let people know about our attractions," Mr. Rice said. "But in 1990 our tourism budget increased from $500,000 to $5 million."
The South is even benefiting from adversity. Its slower industrial development did little to improve its fortunes in the War Between the States, as that sectional unpleasantness is sometimes called, but it left Dixie a passel of historic battlefields and helped preserve much of the region as a birdwatcher's paradise and an eco-tourist's delight.
The region is also well positioned to satisfy the growing interest in history and past cultures. Kentucky, for example, just published a 72-page Heritage Tours booklet, describing tours of the Daniel Boone Trail and giving tips about finding Kentucky ancestors.
Black tourists, in particular, are flocking to the South to see the birthplaces of their forebears and sites important to the civil rights movement. Visits to the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site in Atlanta soared from 500,000 in 1985 to 3.2 million in 1992, according to the National Park Service -- 700,000 more than visited either the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty in 1992.
 
Making Most of Olympics
 The South has been unusually adept at marketing itself as a region, with 11 states founding a nonprofit tourism-promotion agency 25 years ago, Travel South USA Travel. "We share everything, including architects for our welcome centers," said Bill Hardiman, executive vice president of the nonprofit Southeast Tourism Society in Atlanta.
In mid-February, Southern tourism directors met in Atlanta on the 1996 summer Olympic Games, which are expected to attract as many as two million tourists. "The Olympics is not just an Atlanta event, it's an event for the entire Southeast," said Bob Stewart, commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Travel Development.
But one of the biggest reasons for the success of Southern tourism, Mr. Hardiman said, is that "we have organized almost all our cities to hold special events, even cities with populations of 1,000 or less."
Louisiana cities and towns have so many events it requires a 100-page booklet to list them all. But for piquing the interest of tourists it would be hard to resist the advertisement that Tuscaloosa, Ala., has placed in the trade press: "Come See What the Yankees Didn't Burn."

HEADLINE: Executive Brief: THE PENTAGON;
USA Today Undercuts Competition in Somalia

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
A press war of sorts is heating up in Somalia, and some American troops do not like it.
Lieut. Gen. Robert B. Johnston of the Marine Corps, who commands the United States-led coalition in Somalia, has ruled that USA Today may be distributed among the 17,500 American troops, but not Stars and Stripes, the military newspaper that has accompanied United States forces into combat since World War II. 
 Capt. Bob Prucha, a spokesman for the United States Central Command, which directs the military operation from Tampa, Fla., said General Johnston, as the field commander, had decided that one newspaper was enough, particularly since it was free.
But Bill Monroe, the Stars and Stripes ombudsman, suggested in a recent column that General Johnston harbored some hidden vendetta against the newspaper or a fear that Stars and Stripes would report embarrassing complaints against the brass.
"General Johnston has some reason to keep Stripes out that we don't know about," Mr. Monroe said. "He owes the troops there some explanation."
For the last three weeks, the Gannett Company, which publishes USA Today, has donated 5,000 daily copies of the newspaper to troops in Somalia. Stars and Stripes would cost 32 cents a copy, Captain Prucha said, and the military services have groused about picking up the tab.
 
Army General to Help Lead U.N. Force in Somalia
 A two-star Army general has been tapped to be the deputy commander of the United Nations force that will replace the United States-led operation in Somalia.
The general, Maj. Gen. Thomas M. Montgomery, will be second in command to a three-star Turkish officer, Cervik Bir, when the American-led coalition under General Johnston transfers control, probably in late March.
General Montgomery, 52, is director of management in the Office of the Army Chief of Staff and is responsible for Army protocol and base operations worldwide. He is a former NATO strategist in Brussels with a reputation for a steady hand in a crisis.
Military officials say General Montgomery will have to draw on all his diplomatic acumen to help guide the multinational force through what is expected to be a rocky transition for the East African nation.
Pentagon planners estimate that the Somalia operation will cost at least $830 million through September, the end of the current fiscal year. Planners had originally put the cost at $583 million through mid-March, but the military now expects about 4,000 troops to remain in Somalia through early 1994.
 
Pentagon Seeks Buyouts To Ease Pain of Job Cuts
 The Defense Department is trying to soften the blow for thousands of civilian employees whom the Pentagon needs to cut from its shrinking payroll.
The budget that Defense Secretary Les Aspin will send to the White House by March 12 will include $100 million to entice 16,000 of the nearly one million civilian department employees to leave voluntarily rather than be laid off.
In the last two years, military planners have offered uniformed troops lump-sum payments or annuities to winnow the size of the force. Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, has urged the Clinton Administration to offer the same kind of buyout to Pentagon civilians to ease the pain of military spending cuts.
Two other new items in this year's Pentagon budget will be $400 million to help the former Soviet republics dismantle their nuclear weapons, and $200 million for humanitarian aid. In the past, the aid to the Soviet republics has been tacked on by Congress and the costs of peacekeeping missions have come out of the operating budgets of individual services.
 
Report on Naval Scandal Is Waiting for Right Reader
 The Pentagon Inspector General's report on the assault of dozens of women at a 1991 naval aviators convention in Las Vegas, Nev., is virtually complete -- all 300 pages of it -- but there is no Navy Secretary to accept it.
Derek J. Vander Schaaf, the acting Pentagon Inspector General, said a former civilian Navy Secretary, H. Lawrence Garrett 3d, requested his report, so he wanted to submit the second of his two-part report to another civilian.
The trouble is that there is no civilian Navy Secretary, in part because the White House has been slow to nominate senior officials throughout the Government while it concentrates on President Clinton's economic plan. Adm. Frank B. Kelso 2d, the Chief of Naval Operations, is the acting Secretary.
Candidates under consideration include Ray Mabus, a former Governor of Mississippi; Beverly B. Byron, a former Maryland Congresswoman; John Dalton, a Democratic fund-raiser from Texas, and John Holum, a Washington lawyer who researched the issue of homosexuals in the military for the Clinton transition team. Mr. Holum has already turned down the position of Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, in part because of its responsibility for dealing with gay issues.

HEADLINE: Senate Leader Would Link Clinton Economic and Health Packages

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said today that he would like to combine health-care legislation with President Clinton's economic package because "that's the best way" to assure that both proposals get passed.
Appearing on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," Mr. Mitchell suggested that Congress would probably go along with financing part of the health-care program with higher cigarette taxes. But he called a proposed $2-per-pack tax, being discussed by some Clinton advisers, "unrealistically high." 
 And Leon E. Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said higher cigarette taxes were a logical revenue source for helping pay for new health-care programs like universal health insurance.
"It's legitimate to look at a cigarette tax as part of the way to pay for health-care reform," Mr. Panetta said on the ABC News program "This Week."
Not only would such a tax produce billions of dollars to help provide universal health insurance and other reforms, he said, "but more importantly it may try to inhibit the very kind of behavior that produces health-care problems in this country."
Mr. Mitchell said he did not know whether Mr. Clinton would go along with combining his economic and health-care proposals into a single package of legislation, and he indicated he would not do so if the White House objected.
But he said, "I hope that will be the case because that's the best chance to pass health care, and that's the linchpin of the whole effort to control the deficit." He said he hoped to have a health-care package ready by May and perhaps through the Senate by early summer.
Administration officials have acknowledged that additional Federal revenues will be needed to help pay for the health-care reforms. They have said that "sin taxes" on tobacco products and liquor are among the mechanisms being discussed.
Although a sharp increase in the cigarette tax would probably meet strong opposition from the tobacco industry and lawmakers from tobacco states, Mr. Mitchell said he expected Congress to approve "some increase in cigarette taxes" as part of a health-care package.
"I think $2 a pack is probably unrealistically high," he said.
The current Federal tax on cigarettes is 24 cents a pack, while state taxes per pack range from 2.5 cents in Virginia, a major tobacco producer, to 51 cents in Massachusetts. A pack of cigarettes on average costs $1.90.
Critics of a higher tax on cigarettes are expected to argue that, as is the case with virtually all excise taxes, it would hit lower- and middle-income people hardest.
But health experts argue that a sharp increase in the cigarette tax would prompt many people to stop smoking and thereby reduce health-care costs.

Newspaper Ad Staffs Shift From Blues to Upbeat Tune

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
Newspaper executives are feeling better about advertising prospects, which ought to be a leading economic indicator if ever there was one.
Over the last few years, they sang such a monotonous song about how bad advertising sales were that they nearly replaced reporters as the biggest complainers in newspaper offices. 
 Kenneth T. Berents, a newspaper analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons, has surveyed industry executives since 1991 about their projections for ad sales. This year's survey, just published, shows that they expect a modest improvement in display advertising and better sales of classified advertising, which economists say can be a real sign of economic growth.
Mr. Berents' conclusion: "The advertising doldrums that have been with the industry the last several years are ending."
Last year and the year before, the newspaper executives forecast the stalled advertising growth and declines in linage that came to be. This year, instead of projecting unchanged classified advertising as they did last year, publishers told Mr. Berents that they expect growth of nearly 3 per cent. They expect slimmer, but still noticeable growth in national and local display advertising.
The projections are based on a mixture of actual sales, guesses and impressions of imprecise things, like the mood of local merchants. This year, Mr. Berents received survey re- sponses from 217 newspapers.
California publishers are the most pessimistic. Newspaper executives in the Northeast, Mr. Berents said, are the most optimistic.
In the real world, industry executives say, it is becoming nearly bearable to sit through advertising department meetings.
"The mood," said Herbert W. Moloney, senior vice president for advertising at The Philadelphia Inquirer, "is definitely better than it was two years ago and better than it was last year."
 
Gambling on Sports: Statistics Can Lie
 Houston journalists were aghast 10 days ago when KTRK-TV broke the news that an illegal gambling operation had apparently managed to alter sports statistics so that incorrect numbers appeared in at least one of the city's two newspapers, The Houston Chronicle. The tamperers' goal, it seemed, was to manipulate payoffs to bettors who wager on all sorts of statistics -- total passing yardage in football or quarterly scores, to mention a couple of possibilities.
, The Houston Post may have been aghast, but not so much that it missed the opportunity for a little competitive thumb in the eye. All over town, the printed cards on The Post's news racks proclaimed: "Post Sports Always The Right Score."
"They looked like they were trying to use this unfortunate situation," The Chronicle's editor, Jack Loftis, complained a few days ago.
After the TV news account, both newspapers reported that the police had arrested five people who were charged with being members of a betting ring. It is not clear what connections there might have been between the five and newspaper people.
The Chronicle, a Hearst Corporation newspaper that has a bigger circulation than The Post, acknowledged that there were two instances when incorrect statistics were apparently inserted through the paper's computer system and appeared in print.
The Post, owned by W. Dean Singleton's Media News Group, said it had found one error. That one, it said, was proved to be a typographical problem.
Mr. Loftis said he doesn't "necessarily believe that" The Post was error-free.
The Post's editor, Gerald Garcia, defended his paper's position. "They have to admit that their data was wrong because it was," he said. "We didn't have to admit that our data was wrong because it wasn't."
Mr. Loftis said The Chronicle is not sure how its numbers were changed. It may, he said, have been done through a computer terminal that was set up to permit open access to anyone who knew how to use it. But he said the experience had provided The Chronicle with a refresher in one of the basic lessons of the modern newspaper age: computer security is a critical concern. He said the paper had taken steps to prevent tampering from occurring again.
 
Eclipse in Baltimore Of a Onetime Star
 Michael J. Davies, the kind of newspaper publisher people gossip about, spent much of the fall deflecting suggestions that he was on his way out as publisher of The Baltimore Sun, owned by the Times Mirror Company.
But this month, he is scheduled to leave Baltimore -- resigning, he and the company say, for personal reasons, which include that his wife, Cynthia McFadden, is an anchor for Court TV based in New York.
Morale problems at The Sun, declining circulation and other problems were suggested in Baltimore as the culprits that were doing Mr. Davies in.
Times Mirror and Mr. Davies deny that he was done in at all.
In its announcement of his departure, the company spoke of his "very significant contribution" to Times Mirror, both in Baltimore and earlier at The Hartford Courant, where he was publisher for seven years in the 1980's.
Once a star at Times Mirror, Mr. Davies said he had told the company that he wanted to leave last summer. To date, however, Times Mirror has not named a new publisher for The Sun. Mr. Davies, 48, said he is not yet certain what he is going to do.

HEADLINE: REPORT FAULTS U.S. IN HANDLING RIOTS

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
A new study says that despite a history of urban riots the United States has not learned how to improve inner cities and stop the cycle of upheaval.
The riots in Los Angeles last spring underscored the lack of Federal efforts to erase the racial and economic discrimination that led to riots as far back as 1919, said the report, released Saturday by the Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation to coincide with the 25th anniversary of a widely publicized report by the Kerner Commission. 
 In 1968, the commission concluded that the United States was "moving toward two societies, one black, one white -- separate and unequal."
In its report, the Eisenhower Foundation, a Washington organization that maintains anticrime programs in several cities, said: "We can reflect, again, on the same moving picture -- now the April 1992 riots in South-Central Los Angeles. Congress and the White House misunderstood the problem. They then constructed a solution that flew in the face of what really did work."
After the Los Angeles riots, Congress passed a $1.3 billion package of small-business loans and summer jobs. Another plan, vetoed by President George Bush, focused on urban enterprise zones and drug-enforcement efforts.
Instead, said Dr. Lynn A. Curtis, author of the Eisenhower report, the Government should focus on training for high-technology jobs, affordable housing and community development banks that can finance inner-city projects.
The foundation also urged the Government to make these changes:
*Focus on drug treatment and prevention, rather than interdiction.
*Reorganize the Job Training Partnership Act to focus more on unemployed inner-city youths.
*Turn responsibility for building low-income housing over to nonprofit organizations, rather than profit-seeking developers.
*Spend $15 billion more a year in programs for inner-city youths, and an extra $15 billion in inner-city infrastructure, for 10 years.
The Kerner panel, also known as the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, was convened by President Lyndon B. Johnson to find what caused urban riots in the late 1960's.

HEADLINE: CRISIS AT THE TWIN TOWERS: The Puzzle;
A Lack of Definitive Claim For Attack Baffles Officials

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
What is still baffling the investigators trying to determine whether terrorists were behind the World Trade Center bombing is the effective silence that has followed it.
Since attention is a main goal of terrorism, the people responsible for such acts usually find a way to make it clear that they were the ones who carried them out. But in the aftermath of the bombing on Friday at the World Trade Center, none of the more than 50 callers who have claimed responsibility have presented convincing proof. 
 "What has appeared to be lacking is a definitive claim of responsibility in which a group demonstrates that they were the ones who committed the act," said a senior Federal official involved in the investigation.
 
Earmarks of Terrorism
 Yet at the same time, Federal officials and private experts said, the explosion bore many of the earmarks of a terrorist attack, including the size of the explosion and the choice of a symbolic target.
Although it came without warning and apparently did not involve the use of plastic explosives, they said, those facts certainly do not disqualify the bombing from being a terrorist attack.
"Fewer than half of the major terrorist bombings have been preceded by warnings," said Brian Jenkins, a security consultant who is a leading authority on terrorism. For instance, in the 1983 attacks on the United States Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, no warning was given. He added that while terrorists have used plastic explosives like C4 and Semtex in high-profile airplane bombings, they have more often used less sophisticated explosives in other attacks.
"Just because it's not Semtex, doesn't mean that it's not terrorist," Mr. Jenkins said today after Federal officials confirmed that they had found no evidence of plastic explosives in the rubble beneath the World Trade Center.
Apart from terrorism, the authorities are continuing to look into the possibility that an employee's grudge or some other factor might have been behind the attack on Friday, and experts said such a cause remained a strong possibility.
 
Evidence of Planning
 But they stressed that their reviews of past terrorist acts revealed more similarities with the World Trade Center bombing than differences. The choice of the target, the size of the blast and the success in attracting widespread attention, they said, all suggested that the attack had been carefully planned.
"If the motive was publicity, they've certainly gotten everyone's attention," said Bruce Hoffman, who heads a terrorism studies group at the Rand Corporation, based in Santa Monica, Calif.
As Mr. Hoffman acknowledged, the missing link in that theory is that whoever carried out the attack has not yet made clear what cause he was seeking to advertise.
As many as one-third of all terrorist incidents worldwide ultimately go unclaimed, experts believe. But in many of those cases, the choice of target or similarity to a continuing campaign makes the purpose of a terrorist act plain.
But some Government experts said today that it may be too soon to expect those responsible for the attack to come forward. "The idea that terrorists always run out and confess their deeds to the world is simply not true," said a Government official involved in the investigation.
The official noted that in the deadliest terrorist attack to take place on American soil -- the 1975 bombing that killed 11 people in a terminal at La Guardia Airport -- no one ever explicitly took responsibility. The authorities later concluded that Croatian nationalists had been responsible. The officials noted that the terrorists used dynamite, rather than plastic explosives.
The experts said the light weight, concealability and destructive force of plastic explosives had made them favored terrorist weapons.
 
Bombs in Small Places
 In notorious cases like the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Scotland and the bombing two years earlier of a Trans World Airlines jet between Rome and Athens, the malleability of plastic explosives has allowed terrorists to conceal bombs in hiding places as small as a portable radio and under an airplane seat.
In their deadly 1983 attacks against American targets in Beirut, however, pro-Iranian terrorists used nothing more advanced than thousands of pounds of high explosives packed into ordinary trucks.
But experts say access more than tradecraft determines what kind of explosive will be used. In their 1989 car bombing of Colombia's secret police headquarters in Bogota, which killed 52 people, the traffickers relied upon 1,000 pounds of dynamite.
More than by the technology used, terrorism experts said today that the most important clue about the World Trade Center attack was the apparent skill with which it was carried out. "If you don't accept the fact that there was a good deal of sophistication involved," said Neil Livingstone, a security consultant, "whoever did it has to be one of the luckiest people in the world."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Renter-to-Owner Ratio Shifts, and With It the Political Climate

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
IF reports of its death are greatly exaggerated, liberalism may be ailing in New York City because of shifts in a sensitive sociological index: the ratio between condos and condoms.
A larger proportion of New Yorkers now own their homes or apartments than at any time in the 20th century. And owners, rendered less mobile physically and less liquid fiscally by their stakes in real estate, tend to be more politically conservative than renters. Liberal leadership also has been diluted by divisions between black and Hispanic politicians and between white liberals and blacks and by the ascendancy of white liberals in the political establishment. 
 As the share of property owners has grown, the city has been riven by conflicts over what are loosely described as traditional social values -- values that have been put to the test as government usurped New Yorker's personal prerogatives by making condoms available to public school students, teaching tolerance and acceptance of gay and lesbian life styles, and ordering that a gay and lesbian group be allowed to march behind its own banner in the St. Patrick's Day parade.
That those decisions have provoked a vocal backlash could mean several things: the group that once proclaimed itself the silent majority has found its voice again; the group is not a majority at all but has just become louder for the time being than other minorities; New York's reputation for liberalism, like the reports of its demise, has been greatly exaggerated, a possibility raised by the conflicts that culminated in last month's 4-to-3 vote by the Board of Education to dismiss Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, or it could mean all of the above.
The board's voting majority, blithely dismissed by some critics as a Gang of Four, "probably reflects where that population is," Gov. Mario M. Cuomo acknowledged the other day.
"I don't think New York City was ever as liberal as its reputation," Mr. Cuomo said. "I don't think that was ever true. Manhattan has always been very liberal. Queens is not. I will grant you that political power has been mostly Democratic, but I would not say that it has been overwhelmingly liberal."
Not since John V. Lindsay has a self-avowed liberal running with the imprimatur of the ideologically accommodating Liberal Party been elected Mayor. "I do not know what else Mr. Lindsay's victory established," said William F. Buckley Jr., the Conservative Party mayoral candidate whom Mr. Lindsay defeated in 1965, "than that people do scare easily and that New York is a very 'liberal' community."
The following year, though, New Yorkers disproved the second part of Mr. Buckley's thesis, rejecting a referendum on Mr. Lindsay's decision to place civilians on the board that reviews complaints against the police. And in 1969, Mr. Lindsay was re-elected only because a Republican from Staten Island and a conservative Democrat who lived on the Bronx border (one of his home telephone numbers was listed in Westchester, giving a new dimension to the dismissive phrase "outer borough") split the opposition. That conservative Democrat, Mario A. Procaccino, had bitingly dubbed Mr. Lindsay's supporters the "limousine liberals" who, from their economic isolation in Manhattan, preached dogma for others to practice.
Mr. Procaccino, who, in defending his record on racial tolerance, once boasted, "my heart is as black as any man's," was considered more conservative than Abraham D. Beame of Brooklyn, the Democrat whom Mr. Lindsay defeated in 1965 and who succeeded him in 1973. That they were actually closer ideologically on many social issues, if not in stature, had been suggested earlier by Mr. Buckley. The differences between the diminutive Mr. Beame and the statuesque Mr. Lindsay, he had said, "are biological, not political."
Four years later, New Yorkers elected Edward I. Koch, a self-described "liberal with sanity" -- a characterization that his critics questioned on both counts. In 1989, Mr. Koch lost to David N. Dinkins, who, like his once and future Republican rival, Rudolph W. Giuliani, strained to depict himself as Mr. Lindsay's spiritual heir. But Mr. Dinkins, a proud product of Harlem's Democratic machine, also embraced a typically conservative totem -- law and order -- in promising to be the city's toughest mayor on crime.
What is a liberal, anyway? To Irving Kristol's definition of a neoconservative as a liberal who was mugged by reality, Tom Wolfe countered that "a liberal is a conservative who has been arrested." In a 1992 New York Times/CBS-TV News poll last fall, most New York City adults described themselves as politically moderate. About the same proportion called themselves conservative as liberal. Last fall, New York Democrats, tired of losing, embraced a presidential candidate who failed or fudged the customary liberal litmus tests.
Party loyalty and philosophy have been subsumed again by concerns over government's ability to deliver services and to butt out of matters in which it may not belong. That is neither new nor unique.
If any major city rivals New York's reputation as a liberal bastion, it is San Francisco. In the last municipal election there, the liberal establishment and its incumbent Mayor were defeated by a former police chief who promised to get tough with problems ranging from panhandlers to potholes. His election was a vivid reminder that even in a progressive city, concerns about condos and condoms may mean that pragmatism in the defense of property and pristine puberty is no vice.

Snowmobiles: Comparing Liabilities and Assets

DATELINE: LOWVILLE, N.Y.

 BODY:
THE message painted on a plastic-covered bale of hay is simple: "No Snowmobilers! Keep Out!"
That is a succinct summary of one side of a winter-sports debate here in Lewis County, where many people are tired of the constant whine of snowmobiles in their backyards and on local roads. 
 "My husband and I can't enjoy our visits to our camp because dozens of snowmobiles cross our land every weekend," said Nancy Baker. The Bakers own 776 acres in the town of Osceola, where more than 200 inches of snow falls annually and hundreds of snowmobilers ride each weekend.
"We can go out and talk to them, but they just yell at us" or make obscene gestures, she said. "Then they still go through our land."
On the other side of the debate are those who run businesses that rely on the patronage of snowmobilers: grocery stores, bed and breakfasts, motels and bars.
"Our best business is in the winter," said Martin J. Beyer, owner of the Ridgeview Motor Lodge here.
Lewis County is on the Tug Hill Plateau, a fringe of the Adirondacks about 50 miles east of Lake Ontario, and the moist winds off the lake produce a huge amount of snow. By Friday afternoon, all the lodgings in Lewis County are filled. Trucks and trailers pull in carrying sleds with license plates from Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Vermont. "They hear there's great snow in Lewis County and just come," said Karen K. Delmonico, executive director of the county Chamber of Commerce.
Elected officials, caught in the middle, have another concern: insurance for snowmobilers. It used to be provided through an arrangement between snowmobiling associations and the Lewis County Board of Legislators. Then the county decided to provide coverage only for its own roads, telling towns and villages that insurance on local roads was up to them.
In January, the town of Lowville closed its roads to snowmobiles until it could determine whether its insurance policy would cover the operation of snowmobiles on its roads.
The insurance company said the town would be covered until April 6, when its insurance policy expires. The town is waiting for a decision from insurers on the costs of covering snowmobilers in a new policy.
Based on the news about the insurance and protests from businesses, the Lowville Town Board decided on Feb. 18 to reopen the roads until April 6. Just three days later, a snowmobile and a car collided.
The towns of Leyden and Lyonsdale closed all their roads. The Lyonsdale clerk, James M. Szewczyk, said the board "does not plan on opening the roads in the near future."
"I could care less if every bar, motel and restaurant went broke," said Ed Campany, a Lowville resident. "My concern is taxes. If it is going to cost more to have snowmobilers then we don't need them."
But Mr. Beyer, the lodge owner, said the opponents of snowmobiling should have to prove that it is costing the county extra money.
"You can say it, but you haven't proven it," he said.
This February a committee of local businessmen, county and regional government officials and local law enforcement personnel began a study of the economic impact of the snowmobiling industry here.
Earlier this winter, Mr. Beyer did his own study. He asked a group of out-of-state snowmobilers to "keep a tab of every dime they spent in Lewis County over a three-day stay." Using those numbers, he said he calculated that snowmobilers from out of town spent $1,261,250 on any given week.
Lynn Truesdell, president of the New York State Snowmobiling Coordinating Group, representing about 120 snowmobile clubs in the state, is a believer in what snowmobilers do for the economy. And he is not sure that local governments will get what they want by restricting the sport.
"You can close the roads from here to heck-won't-have-it, but accidents are going to happen," he said.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Economic Plan Finding Respect From Corporate America

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
When he was running for President, Bill Clinton had relatively little support from business outside the Silicon Valley and a few traditionally Democratic corners of Wall Street. But as President Clinton, he is being surprisingly well received in corporate board rooms across the country.
Since Mr. Clinton presented his economic blueprint to Congress and the nation 12 days ago, he has crisscrossed the country to meet with business leaders and seek their support. And so far, he seems to be getting it -- even though the program will inflict pain on many rich business executives and on their corporations. 
 "It behooves everybody, businessmen and average individuals alike, to really make this work," said Roberto C. Goizueta, chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, echoing a theme voiced by many executives in interviews the last few days. "If he succeeds, we all succeed. If he fails, we all fail."
Attitudes may change as more details of the program come out, or as executives have a better chance to weigh its consequences. For now, though, many executives say that any dissatisfaction they have over parts of the program is outweighed by the leadership Mr. Clinton has shown in addressing problems like the Federal budget deficit and health care.
"There are some things in the program that bite our company hard, and this is going to hurt today," said Vernon R. Loucks Jr., chairman and chief executive of Baxter International Inc., a health-care company. "But there isn't going to be a future if we don't get these things solved.
"I didn't vote for Clinton. But there is real deficit reduction in this program, and if we are disciplined enough, we could be pleasantly surprised three or four years from now."
Business leaders said their respect for Mr. Clinton began to rise at the economic summit meeting he held in Little Rock, Ark., in December. At that two-day meeting, some executives said, Mr. Clinton, then the President-elect, exhibited a broad understanding of many of the nation's economic problems.
"I have been impressed by this man," said Harold R. (Red) Poling, chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, who has met with Mr. Clinton three times since the election, including at the Little Rock meeting. "In my meetings with him, he exhibited a broad knowledge of a wide range of issues. He listens very carefully and is very much a people-oriented person. He pays attention to what you are saying, and he takes the time to do it. That not only impresses me, it literally amazes me."
Mr. Clinton's theme of shared sacrifice, which he struck in his speech to a joint session of Congress on Feb. 17, has also altered many executives' attitudes.
"The talk about shared sacrifice and fairness had an awful lot of appeal to the population and to the business population," said Paul H. O'Neill, chairman and chief executive of Alcoa.
 
Impact of Perot
 Ian Arnof, president and chief executive of the First Commerce Corporation, Louisiana's largest bank holding company, struck a similar theme: "My sense is they are trying to put as much on the table as they can and to spread the cost as much as they can. His speech made a lot of sense."
Mr. Arnof said that business executives in his part of the country had paid more attention to Ross Perot's reaction to the Clinton proposals than they had to that of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
"It appears that Perot has not been unhappy with what Clinton has been doing," Mr. Arnof said. "That has given him some more credibility."
Because the White House and both houses of Congress are controlled by Democrats for the first time since Jimmy Carter was President, at this juncture business would seem to have little tactical choice but to try to work with Mr. Clinton rather than confront him.
 
Concern Over Health Costs
 A key test for many executives will be whether the President's health-care package alleviates what has become a millstone for many companies and to what extent it would be financed by a large tax increase.
"I know how much Intel pays per employee for our health plan every year," said Craig R. Barrett, chief operating officer of the Intel Corporation, the semiconductor giant. "And by simple math, it tells me it will cost $60 billion to $100 billion to provide universal health care. That is a big enough number to make me worry, and it smells like a big tax increase."
But for now, such concerns seem to be outweighed by the Clinton persona and the President's active approach to managing the economy, which is seen by some as providing aid long overdue to the private sector.
"There is a realization among business people that they want someone who is engaged in the activities of the economy," said Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board. "We reached the limits of laissez-faire economics after the first term of the Reagan Administration. The ideology of allowing business to compete totally without Government support is so in contrast with what businesses are encountering in the global marketplace that it creates a demand for a President who is engaged in making the U.S. economy the world's most competitive."
Mr. Barrett of Intel said "the true measure will come when we see how responsive Government is to being a fast-moving, just-in-time Government to the threats we in industry face. If Government can't move the regulatory environment and the bureaucracy with the speed the business world needs, the incentives this plan is offering us won't mean much."
 
Some Lingering Doubts
 Indeed, even as business, like much of the nation, seems ready to give Mr. Clinton the benefit of the doubt and its support, doubts about the man and his program linger. And skepticism about Congress remains deep-seated.
News accounts of the details of how the economic program took shape, for example, are a nagging source of worry for some executives. From those reports, some said, they saw a President who had too quickly allowed political arguments to dampen the degree of sacrifice that is necessary.
"I have one lingering uneasiness that the President's sense about what to do will be tempered by those who know too much about political suicide," said Mr. O'Neill of Alcoa. "I told him at the economic conference in Little Rock he ought to act like he was going to be a one-term President, and that by doing that, he would insure himself a second term."
Mr. O'Neill said he was bothered by Mr. Clinton's retreat from supporting a freeze on cost-of-living adjustment increases on Social Security checks.
Similarly, Mr. Barrett at Intel said he was annoyed that billions in financing for the supercollider and space station projects were left intact, apparently for political reasons.
 
Hope for Further Cutbacks
 Calls for more spending cuts were a frequent refrain.
"There would be more support for a more aggressive attack on spending," said William D. Ruckelshaus, chairman and chief executive of Browning-Ferris Industries and a former official in the Nixon and Ford Administrations.
Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, credits Mr. Clinton with courage in proposing "a real budget deficit effort" and in changing the terms of the debate on that issue. But he predicted that the relatively minor annoyances business executives are now finding in the President's program will be eclipsed by much more profound ones when companies finally look at the fine print of the Clinton program. Its provisions are particularly onerous for small businesses, he said.
"The business tax burden is a lot larger than either business or the White House appreciates," Mr. Jasinowski said. "Business taxes are three times greater than the incentives the program is offering. And the biggest tax increase of all is on subchapter S corporations, who file individual tax returns."
According to Mr. Jasinowski, a third of the nation's 300,000 manufacturing concerns fall into this category. Under the Clinton program, their Federal income taxes would rise to just under 40 percent, well above the 36 percent level the President is asking larger companies to pay.
"The program needs to be restructured," Mr. Jasinowski said, "and Congress may substantially improve it."
That thought also occurred to Mr. Ruckelshaus.
"We could be looking at the reverse of what happened in the early 1980's with Ronald Reagan," he said, recalling that Congress tacked on far more tax cuts than Mr. Reagan had originally asked for.
"Once it is O.K. politically to talk about cutting, and the President has led the way," Mr. Ruckelshaus said, "it may be that Congress may be receptive to it and go ahead and take on these programs."

HEADLINE: Bentsen Sits Tall at Group of 7 Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's trip to Britain for a meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers did not play out as Mr. Smith goes to London, but as Mr. Bentsen rides into town tall in the saddle.
What enabled him to come to the meeting of the leading industrial nations in a commanding position -- a far stronger one than his predecessor, Nicholas F. Brady, usually had -- was President Clinton's bold plan to cut the budget deficit. 
 In recent years, it was often awkward and occasionally embarrassing for Mr. Brady or his aides to press Germany, Japan or other members of the Group of Seven to alter their policies to straighten out their economies and fuel global growth. America's economic partners often scolded Washington for not putting its own economic house in order before telling others what to do.
 
A Fortified Position
 Judging from the give and take at the meeting today of the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers, Mr. Clinton's deficit-cutting plan has changed that. Officials at the meeting said the Clinton plan had enabled Mr. Bentsen, on his first foreign trip as Treasury Secretary, to urge Germany and Japan to move more boldly to stimulate their economies without having America's problems thrown back in his face.
"There's no question that it fortified our position and the credibility of what we want to do," Mr. Bentsen said after the meeting.
What Mr. Bentsen aims to do through the Group of Seven -- the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- is create a stronger foundation for economic growth, not just in the United States, but worldwide. After the meeting, a senior Treasury official said with uncharacteristic bluntness that he would like Germany's central bank to lower its interest rates, a suggestion that the prickly Bundesbank might view as improper outside pressure.
A German rate cut would help to push down interest rates and lift Europe out of recession, encouraging the importing of more American goods.
The senior official also said Japan should spend more on public works and take other measures to stimulate its economy. If it did this, it would probably suck in more imports from the United States and elsewhere, helping to reduce Japan's colossal trade surplus and stimulate the world economy.
 
Debut Favorably Reviewed
 For Mr. Bentsen, the weekend meeting was a test, with other ministers wanting to look him over and hear how committed he and the Clinton Administration are to free trade and deficit reduction. He came away with favorable reviews, although sometimes it was hard to tell when his colleagues were applauding the message and when they were cheering the messenger.
First, Group of Seven officials found Mr. Bentsen more dynamic, focused and on top of his subject than his predecessor, Mr. Brady. Helped by President Clinton's economic package and the President's speech on Friday promising not to be protectionist, Secretary Bentsen convinced the other finance ministers that Washington was dead serious about free trade and its budget deficit.
"There was a very strong welcome for President Clinton's package," said Norman Lamont, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, the host of the meeting.
Mr. Bentsen added, "They were quite enthusiastic about the actions we have taken."
 
Badgering Is Out
 Even before the meeting, Mr. Bentsen made it clear that he wanted to use a new tool to promote global growth: friendly nudging of his Group of Seven partners, rather than the sometimes strident badgering under President George Bush. He seems to be taking the same collegial quiet approach that he took with his colleagues when he was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
Several Group of Seven governments are suffering setbacks. Britain's has been embarrassed by its currency crisis, Italy's has been weakened by scandal and France's current leadership is expected to be trounced in elections in March.
In ways, Group of Seven meetings have come to resemble sensitivity sessions: ministers analyze their problems -- like recession, high unemployment, inflationary pressures and large trade deficits -- then brainstorm about how to resolve the problems alone and through cooperation.
"It's probably the best opportunity in a decade to coordinate these efforts," a senior Treasury official said after the meeting. American, British, French and Italian officials are urging Germany and Japan to do more to promote growth and are optimistic about seeing results soon.
 
High Hopes for Rate Cut
 With inflationary pressures in Germany starting to abate, there are high hopes that Germany's central bank will cut rates within a few weeks. And the Japanese Government is expected to adopt a stronger economic stimulus program in time for the Group of Seven economic summit meeting in Japan in July, a move that would no doubt defuse outside pressures on Tokyo.
Mr. Bentsen got off on the wrong foot in Japan when he suggested a week ago that the yen was undervalued. That remark sent the yen soaring against the dollar and angered some Japanese officials, who worry that a strong yen will worsen Japan's economic slowdown. Treasury officials say Mr. Bentsen's remark was inadvertent, but Japanese officials say they are not so sure.
In London, Mr. Bentsen's Treasury quickly showed that it had mastered some of the fine points of modern-day message-sending. During the closed session with other ministers, he gently suggested that Germany and Japan do more to promote growth. Then, at a briefing for American journalists, a senior Treasury official, insisting on anonymity, spoke in a muscular tone, pointedly urging Germany to cut its rates and Japan to stimulate its economy. Finally, at a full-blown news conference, Mr. Bentsen urged all of the nations to do more to promote growth, without pointing fingers.
 
Grueling Schedule
 Mr. Bentsen's schedule would have been grueling for someone half his age -- he is 72. He caught a 6:45 A.M. flight from Washington on Friday, changed planes at Kennedy Airport in New York and arrived in London at 9:30 P.M. Sitting in business class, he read his briefing book as intensely as a law student cramming for the bar exam. He also discussed the global economy at length with Lawrence H. Summers, the Treasury's Under Secretary-Designate for international affairs.
The Treasury Secretary slept for five hours Friday night and went to a 7:30 breakfast (2:30 Washington time) with Mr. Lamont. Next was an 8:30 meeting with Germany's Finance Minister, Theodor Waigel, and then the Group of Seven session, which lasted from 9:30 to 2:30. Then came news briefings, interviews and a rush to Heathrow airport for a 6 P.M. plane to New York. After switching at Kennedy, he arrived in Washington around 10:30 Saturday night.
"I forgot how much I enjoyed the pace of the Senate, which was three weeks on and one week off," he said somewhere over the Atlantic. "Now I work an eight-day week."
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, joined Mr. Bentsen on the flights. While taking a stroll in the aisle to stretch his legs, Mr. Greenspan joked to some reporters and Treasury officials: "I've had enough. I'm getting out of here."
Ted Truman, a Federal Reserve official accompanying the chairman, responded, "Is that an experiment to see whether the markets go up or down?"

HEADLINE: Orders for Machine Tools Off 15% in January

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools dropped in January, the Association for Manufacturing Technology said today. But economists said better days might be ahead if the economy continued to improve.
Orders slumped 15 percent in January, to $175.3 million, and were off 19.4 percent from January 1992, the trade group said. 
 Despite the current weakness in demand, economists said the increasing signs of economic vigor would eventually encourage industries to refurbish plants with new machine tools, which are metal-cutting and metal-forming tools used in the manufacturing of other machinery.
 
Wait-and-See Stance
Machine-tool orders provide a gauge of future industrial health because machine tools are needed to produce goods ranging from refrigerators to aircraft engines.
On Friday, the Commerce Department reported that in the final quarter of 1992 the economy had its best spurt of growth in five years. Some economists say the foundation has been laid for continued self-sustaining growth.
The trade group said the current flagging demand for machine tools stemmed from businesses taking a wait-and-see stance toward the investment tax credit proposals made by President Clinton on Feb. 17.
The President's plan for bolstering the economy calls for a temporary 7 percent incremental tax credit for big businesses and a permanent 5 percent rate for smaller firms, which could be applied toward machine tool purchases.
The president of the manufacturing technology group, Albert Moore, said he expected machine tool orders to increase as industry executives became more familiar with the advantages the Clinton plan offers them.
"Now that these points have been cleared up in the President's economic address, we hope to see a pickup in orders during the coming weeks," Mr. Moore said.
The trade group said January shipments of machine tools plunged 23 percent, to $247.7 million, but were up 55 percent from a year earlier. There is a 12- to 18-month gap between orders and actual shipments.
January orders from foreign customers slipped 1.3 percent, to $33.8 million, the group said. But compared with January 1992, they soared 157 percent.
 
Tool Imports Weaken
Sales in the United States of foreign-made machine tools have been slowing because of higher foreign currency values, quality improvements in American-made tools and voluntary restraints to curb imports from Japan and Taiwan.
At the same time, American exports have been steadily increasing, though slowed by the weak global economy.
About a third of American-made machine tools are sold abroad and the rest are sold domestically, the group said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Insiders Vie to Be Economist's Editor

BYLINE: By SUZANNE CASSIDY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
When, in a week or so, the name of the next editor of The Economist is announced, even the most faithful of its readers may not recognize it.
But then it may not ring many bells among London media types, either. 
 Simon Jenkins, former editor of The Times of London and a onetime Economist political editor, quotes the prevailing wisdom -- that the list of candidates for the top job at The Economist is probably "the most anonymous short list" there has ever been for so prominent a position. But that, he noted, is "the rule, the tradition" there.
Articles generally appear without bylines, allowing the news weekly to be iconoclastic and yet speak with the voice of an institution.
Rupert Pennant-Rea, its editor since 1986, is leaving to become deputy governor of the Bank of England. His successor will be chosen from among nine candidates, eight men and a woman, all of them Economist insiders who either work or have worked for the publication and understand what Mr. Pennant-Rea describes as its "distinctive culture."
 
Lively and Special Culture
 It is a culture in which a publication that looks very much like a magazine is called a "newspaper" by those who work for it. The way The Economist is produced, Mr. Pennant-Rea insists, is "very similar to the way a daily newspaper is produced." Philosophically, it is a culture in which free trade is championed -- indeed, that is why The Economist was founded in 1843 -- and where lively debate is encouraged, both in print and in the editor's office.
Mr. Pennant-Rea called The Economist "very consciously, a views paper," one that thrives on intellectual argument. "Editing this newspaper," he said, "is 95 percent democracy and 5 percent autocracy." Not many journalists from outside The Economist hothouse can deal with that, he said, which is why the publication has a strong tradition of hiring its top editors from within.
The short list of candidates to replace Mr. Pennant-Rea includes The Economist's foreign editor, its editor for Britain, its Asia correspondent and its environment editor. According to the British press and to Economist staff members, however, the most serious contenders are Nicholas Colchester, who is now Mr. Pennant-Rea's deputy editor; the business affairs editor, Bill Emmott; its Washington bureau chief, Mike Elliott; the economics editor, Clive Crook, and a former America editor, Matt Ridley.
All of these five except Mr. Elliott are alumni of Magdalen College at Oxford. Staff members say this is partly a result of the efforts of R. W. Johnson, a Magdalen don who, in the late 1970's, went out of his way to bring promising students to the attention of Andrew Knight, then The Economist's editor.
 
Very Much a Going Concern
 The person who gets the job will take over a publication that, unlike many of the national economies it covers, is in remarkably good health.
Despite the recession, which has had many other publications on the ropes, The Economist's profits have grown swiftly in the last few years. In the fiscal year that ended in March 1988, for instance, it had pretax profits of 5.6 million and revenue of 37.4 million. In the year that ended in March 1992, pretax profits stood at 10.4 million and revenue totaled 60.1 million.
Circulation has risen steeply, as well. In the five years before Mr. Pennant-Rea took over in 1986, it had grown 45 percent worldwide and had doubled in North America. Since then, global circulation has increased an additional 72 percent, from nearly 291,000 to 502,662 for the first half of 1992. Of that, nearly 221,000 was in North America.
The news weekly is published by The Economist Newspaper Ltd., a privately held concern that is half-owned by The Financial Times, a subsidiary of Pearson P.L.C.
However The Economist's top editor is chosen, that choice is likely to have business as well as editorial consequences. David Gordon, group chief executive of the parent company, said that The Economist's editor is usually on the board and is a member of the executive committee of the Economist Group.
As such, he or she is involved in decisions about the group's other interests, which include The Economist Intelligence Unit, an international business information company and some specialist magazines.
Although the magazine is significantly concerned with business news and hopes to "provide clear guidance for people who take decisions and make money," Mr. Gordon noted, there have been "pretty good editors whose forte was not business and economics."
 
English as a First Language
 The journal's global appeal, he continued, goes well beyond the loyalty of Anglophiles. "The numbers of people who get involved each year in world trade and overseas investment are growing very rapidly," he said. "And many of these people speak English."
They want an English-language publication that will offer that global perspective, he said. And The Economist, which unlike Time and Newsweek is editorially the same the world over, provides that.
Where the magazine has failed to shine, some feel, is on its home territory. Average circulation in Britain and Ireland for the period of January to June 1992 stood at less than 101,000, an increase of more than 15,000 from the same period in 1986. This was a gain, to be sure, but hardly one keeping pace with those abroad.
Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times of London and once The Economist's Britain editor, is among those who say that the magazine has lost its domestic impact. These critics point to its enthusiastic support for Britain's entry into the European Community's Exchange Rate Mechanism -- an experiment that ended ignominiously for Prime Minister John Major's Government in September -- as evidence that the magazine has lost touch with its home base.
"That is the price of being an international success story," Mr. Neil said. "Its coverage of domestic issues is very poor now." He thinks that The Economist risks compounding its mistakes in Britain by choosing "some unknown" as its next editor
"I would have gone for a big-name outsider," he added, "someone to give it a personality and a direction in Britain."
Richard Lambert, editor of The Financial Times, disagreed. "It has been so successful," he said, "that I would have been amazed if they had felt it necessary to go outside."

HEADLINE: New York Sets Rules to Curb Auditors' Zeal

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
New York has long had a reputation as one of the nation's most aggressive states in trying to get people to pay the taxes it thinks they owe.
Now, even James W. Wetzler, the state's tax commissioner, concedes things have gotten out of hand. Last week he issued guidelines aimed at reining in overly zealous state tax agents who try to prove that people who say they live elsewhere are actually state residents -- at least for tax purposes. 
 Mr. Wetzler is worried by a mountain of anecdotal evidence that the auditors are doing more to hurt than help the state's economy. He worries that they are alienating people whose main home might be in Connecticut or New Jersey but who maintain an apartment in New York City. Or they might be longtime New Yorkers who retired to Florida and did not even keep their New York homes.
Either out of anger or to make sure they are not considered residents, many people have closed bank and brokerage accounts; sold businesses in the state; stopped using New York professionals like accountants, doctors and dentists; stopped giving to New York charities and politicians; limited trips to New York, and even avoided taking vacations in the state.
 
Summers, and Taxes
 The new guidelines make it clear that people should not be penalized for taking a vacation in New York or returning to use an accountant.
"We should encourage former New York domiciliaries to return to New York for visits, shopping trips, etc.," the guidelines say. "We should let nonresident taxpayers know that if they happen to keep a bank account open in New York or seek some professional advice in New York they will not be hounded by an auditor or assumed to be a New York resident."
One person who believes he is being hounded is Paul A. Burke, a retired businessman who moved with his wife, Ellen, to Jupiter, Fla., from Lewiston, N.Y., in 1985. They have returned to New York only for summers. The Tax Division contends that he was a resident for tax purposes in the 1987, 1988 and 1989 tax years. "And there's no assurance they won't come after me for additional years," he said.
"Former residents," he said, "would certainly like to keep some of their New York ties and old comfortable banking relations, accounting relations, country clubs and summer homes because of the delightful summer temperatures and scenery. But New York is making it nearly impossible to do that."
If New York prevails in his case, he said, he will sever many of his New York ties -- and will even sell his burial plots in Kenmore near Niagara Falls -- "in an effort to avoid further pursuit."
Under New York laws, someone who is deemed a resident has to pay state income taxes not only on his salary but also on so-called passive income like interest, dividends and capital gains. This is no small matter because New York is a high-tax state. New York's top marginal income-tax rate of 7.875 percent is among the 15 highest in the country. Those deemed New York City residents for tax purposes face an additional 4.46 percent tax, which makes their combined state and local income-tax burden among the highest in the country.
 
Wealthiest Targeted
 By comparison, the New Jersey's top rate is 7 percent, Connecticut's is 4.5 percent and their municipalities do not levy income taxes.
Widespread tax dodging prompted the state to begin a crackdown five years ago on people who said they were not residents but still maintained ties to the state, targeting the returns of the wealthiest -- those with incomes in high six and seven figures.
Over the last two years the Department of Taxation and Finance was able to persuade the Legislature to double, to 80, the number of field auditors who have been conducting 3,500 to 4,000 field audits a year. The annual cost of their salaries and benefits totals about $3.2 million. A field auditor actually goes out and pays a call on a taxpayer.
Money collected from the program has been running more than $50 million a year. They have totaled $214.4 million since 1988. "It is our most productive personal-income-tax, field-audit program," Mr. Wetzler said.
There are several reasons that a person living out of state might be considered a state resident for tax purposes even if he or she no longer maintains a home in the state.
For example, people who lived and owned businesses in New York and then moved to, say, Florida but retained ownership of the business, often are still considered residents for tax purposes.
Mr. Burke's business interests in New York, apartment buildings and a mobile-home park, appear to be the main reasons the state considers him a resident for tax purposes. He insists that he is not actively involved in their management and that it is absurd to think he could do so from Florida.
"No peer group could believe that in one or two seven-minute phone conversations per week you could run a business," he said. "It would absolutely fail."
The Burkes sold their longtime residence in North Tonawanda, N.Y., in 1985 and bought the Lewiston home, which is on a golf course, to spend the summer, Mr. Burke said. While he maintained his New York driver's license, he said he has a Florida license, is registered to vote in Florida, has filed tax returns as a Floridian and even took a $25,000 homestead tax exemption available only to Florida residents.
"Voting in Florida and taking the exemption would make me a felon if New York prevails," he said.
To support its case, the Tax Division has cited the Lewiston home and the fact that its phone is on all year; Mr. Burke says the reason is because the fire-protection and security systems are tied to the phone. The tax division offers other evidence that in Mr. Burke's heart New York is his home, including the facts that he still has a bank account and country club membership and uses an auditor, doctor and dentist in New York.
 
Any Part of a Day Counts
 Some auditors have reportedly cited making donations to New York charities as evidence that a nonresident still sees New York as home. Accountants and lawyers say that some auditors have even contended that the fact a couple has adult children or grandchildren living in New York is proof they must still be New Yorkers.
Then there are statutory residents: those whose main homes are outside the state but who maintain dwellings in New York and spend more than 183 days of a tax year in the state. Any part of a day spent in New York, even if not for work, counts. The portion of aperson's earnings, including passive income, that is taxable is the percent of the total days worked that were worked in New York. That is the definition that complicated the lives of Milton and Sylvia Stevens.
According to legal documents in their case, after Mr. Stevens sold his company and retired, the couple, who had been longtime residents of Roslyn Heights, L.I., began living in Florida part of the year. In 1980, they bought a condominium in Key Biscayne as their primary home.
They registered to vote there, obtained Florida driver licenses, paid taxes as full-fledged Floridians, stated that they were permanent Floridians in their wills, became deeply involved in local charities and social organizations and, in 1986, sold the property in Hicksville where the business was located and which they had retained. Beginning in 1986, they stopped filing New York tax returns as residents.
But they kept the home in Roslyn Heights and returned there for much of the summer. They maintained two checking accounts in New York (besides one in Florida), used a New York dentist, kept safety deposit boxes in Florida and New York and maintained their membership in a tennis club. And at least in 1986, they could not provide proof that they had spent more than 183 days outside of New York.
As far as the New York State tax department was concerned, all this was enough to prove that the couple were still New York State residents. The department's Tax Division demanded $111,871.89 in taxes, interest and penalties for 1986 through 1988.
 
Tough on Documentation
 The Stevenses fought and won a partial victory. Last year, an administrative law judge ruled that they had proven that Florida was indeed their permanent residence. But for 1986, he said, they had to pay $37,325.97. Accountants say state auditors have become much tougher in their demands for proof of not being in New York. For example, many no longer accept work diaries alone and have demanded that every out-of-state entry be documented with things like restaurant, plane or hotel receipts; company expense reports, and phone bills.
The new guidelines suggest that auditors do a spot check of diary entries to see if there are receipts to support them and, if there are, to assume that the rest are true. They suggest taking a similar approach in deciding whether to accept oral statements.
The guidelines also advise auditors to be more trusting when someone maintains that he or she spent the weekend at their main home in say, New Jersey or Connecticut.
Alex K. Salomon, a Manhattan accountant, said a client produced a receipt showing he was at the Darien Country Club on a specific Saturday afternoon in the late 1980's. "The auditors said, 'Fine, but how do we know he did not have breakfast in the city?' "
That case, which ended two weeks ago, dragged on for more than two and a half years. The state had been demanding more than $150,000 in taxes, penalties and interest. His client ended up paying the state less than $5,000. "But the total audit probably cost my client $40,000 to $50,000 in accountant and lawyer fees," he said.

HEADLINE: Cracow Philharmonic As an Orchestra In Painful Transition

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CRACOW, Poland

 BODY:
Like so many other Eastern European cultural institutions, the Cracow Philharmonic, now making a North American tour that will end on March 3 at Avery Fisher Hall, finds itself in an awkward, sometimes painful transition.
The American journey, its first since the fall of Communism, has come at a crucial time for the orchestra, and its sponsors hope that box-office income as well as charitable contributions inspired by its presence will alleviate some of its more pressing problems. The musicians' wages, like those of all Polish orchestras and formerly state-supported educated professions, are well below the national average, which is itself grievously below Western standards in an economy crippled by a half-century of Communism and today's soaring inflation. In addition, the Cracow Philharmonic's concert hall was burned to its outer walls in December 1991, destroying its beloved pipe organ (a melted mass of metal, on display in the lobby, which makes a handsome if eerie sculptural statement) and its library of scores. 
 Although Cracow's orchestral tradition extends back to the early 19th century, the present orchestra was founded in 1945, when much of the rest of Poland was devastated by war. Cracow itself, the handsome seat of ancient Polish kings and of a still great university, had been spared as an architectural treasure.
Now the Cracow Philharmonic is among the country's best orchestras. It has also been particularly open to outsiders, with Gilbert Levine, a New Yorker, as the principal conductor and de facto music director from 1987 to 1991 (under the composer Krzysztof Penderecki, who led the orchestra's last American tour seven years ago), and Jean Paul Penin, a Frenchman, the latest principal guest conductor. Jerzy Maksymiuk, a Pole, will become principal conductor in the fall, but Mr. Levine is leading the orchestra on the American tour.
At a free open rehearsal of the tour program in the orchestra's 1,000-seat Philharmonic Hall, the orchestra made a typically warm, relaxed central European sound. This proved especially effective in Henryk Gorecki's "Three Pieces in Olden Style" for string orchestra; the suddenly popular composer, whose Nonesuch recording of his Third Symphony has proved such a hit in the United States and Britain, lives in neighboring Katowice.
 
A Time of Tensions
 The only sign of strain came as Mr. Levine pushed his strings for tonal brilliance and accurate, energetic ensemble in the final movement of the Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 3 ("Polish"). Mr. Levine attributes the problems primarily to the players' "cigar-box" instruments (he says the brass is somewhat better), rather than to any failings of technique. But he also says his tenure in Cracow was characterized by a sometimes abrasive, sometimes productive tension between the orchestra's relaxed tradition and his more aggressive, Juilliard-trained instincts.
By all accounts, Mr. Levine, who was more or less forced upon the orchestra by the then all-powerful Mr. Penderecki, had to work hard to win the musicians' trust. That was partly a matter of his being Jewish in what is now an almost entirely Catholic land. (The Nazis and to a lesser extent the Soviets reduced the once thriving Cracow Jewish community to around 200.)
Mr. Levine, whose family came to the United States from Poland a century ago and whose mother-in-law survived Auschwitz, hardly soft-pedaled his Jewishness. He even led concerts in the unused main Temple Synagogue. But he also built bridges to the Catholics, playing at the Vatican for Pope John Paul II, the former Archbishop of Cracow.
 
'Now They Love Him'
 Most of the players seem to have been won over. "He was the first foreigner here, and he was in some ways imposed by Penderecki," said Maria Osterwa-Czekaj of OTV Cracow, the television station. "But now they love him. The ceremony of his farewell in 1991 was so touching: almost everybody cried."
Perhaps not everybody. There are some musicians who reportedly still resist his hard-driving style and mutter that Mr. Levine left under duress in 1991, "kicked out" by the orchestra. Mr. Levine insists that he was the one to quit, and for strictly financial reasons: in an economy where the musicians are paid a base salary of less than $150 a month, 40 percent less than the overall national average, he says he simply could no longer afford to spend more than a third of the year in Cracow.
Formerly coddled by the culture-proud Communists, musicians must now teach or otherwise supplement their incomes to survive, and some have left for Germany or Switzerland for Western salaries. So far the orchestra's management, appointed by the provincial government, has had no luck attracting corporate sponsors.
Mr. Penin, too, says his salary is extremely low but adds that he can sustain himself with other engagements and that his Cracow fee is augmented by the French Government. In his new position as "conductor laureate-honored guest conductor," Mr. Levine will spend about six weeks a year with the orchestra.
 
Behind a Tour
 The American tour, organized by Mr. Levine, is being sponsored by the Polish National Alliance and the Polish American Congress, and hence is playing in cities with especially large Polish-American populations. That happens to entail most of the major cities of the American Midwest and East Coast, however, as well as Toronto. The orchestra is being accompanied by Tadeisz Piekarz, the Governor of Cracow Province, which has taken over support and control of the orchestra from the old Communist Ministry of Culture in Warsaw.
The fire that gutted Philharmonic Hall was said by some to have been electrical in origin but was thought by others to have been arson by disgruntled Communists. (Every event in Eastern Europe seems to inspire a conspiracy theory.) There is also some disagreement about whether a debt exists for the reconstruction of the hall. But all agree that the pipe organ (at a cost of $1 million) and music library must be replaced. The tour sponsors hope to earn a profit by keeping expenses low (a $35 per diem, giddily high by Polish standards, and intercity travel by bus).
 
'We've Opened Up'
 The Cracow Philharmonic was, like so many Eastern bloc artistic institutions, artificially preserved in its 19th-century bourgeois traditions by the political and economic isolation of Communism. The members of this youngish orchestra, in which half the string players are women, still derives almost entirely from Cracow. But the inexorable process of internationalization is well under way, and despite some nostalgic regrets by Westerners at that loss of innocence, the players welcome the chance to make fresh contact with the outside.
"We've opened up by working with foreigners and by constantly bringing young people into the orchestra," said Czeslaw Pilawski, a violinist and the personnel manager.
Wladislav Znijowski, a cellist who is among the orchestra's concertmasters, added: "And we want to remain open. We want to stay informed about the world, to see what is going on outside Cracow."

HEADLINE: CRISIS AT THE TWIN TOWERS: The Good News;
Office Suppliers See Silver Lining

BYLINE: By Saul Hansell

 BODY:
If there are any winners from the bombing in the World Trade Center, they may be office-supply vendors who provided the equipment for the temporary quarters being set up.
The First Boston Corporation bought $400,000 worth of computers over the weekend so that 200 of the 950 employees based in its 5 World Trade Center back office could move into its midtown office. 
 Comdisco Disaster Recovery Services bought 50 new fax machines at a discount store to accommodate the three foreign banks that have set up temporary offices in its North Bergen, N.J., office. The company, which provides computer backup and other support to businesses in disasters, expects to house 600 employees from these banks this morning.
Many banks and brokerage firms housed in the trade center had emergency backup plans to move essential functions either to other offices they own or to emergency sites provided by specialized vendors like Comdisco. But the scale of the disruptions at the World Trade Center is causing many of them to expand their plans.
 
Tight Squeeze at First Boston
 First Boston, for example, had one floor of its 49th Street office building as a backup site with desks and computers for 100 employees. Over the weekend, it told employees on a second floor to clear out to make space for another 100 back-office workers from the World Trade Center, said Robert M. Raziano, its chief financial and administrative officer.
The affected departments monitor trades for regulatory compliance and handle the details of exchanging money and securities. Until the trade center space is restored, First Boston will let certain functions, like mailing out customer statements, fall behind.
First Boston has been told by the Port Authority that it may move back in if it handles its own fire safety.
Overall, the company has spent at least $750,000 over the last two days, but the $400,000 for computers was on machines that it would have bought eventually. Much of the additional cost may be covered by insurance, Mr. Raziano said.
DKB Financial Products, a subsidiary of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo bank, Japan's largest bank, has established a skeleton office in Jersey City with two computers that can perform essential functions, because its offices are completely closed.
This office will not book any new business. Still, DKB's more complex transactions, like interest-rate and currency swaps and options, must be hedged constantly to adjust for the changing markets. And traders have been assigned to New Jersey to handle these transactions.
 
Contracting Backup Space
 Instead of maintaining their own backup spaces as DKB does, some businesses contract with vendors like Comdisco, which maintain offices and computer centers that can be used in the case of emergency.
Companies pay a monthly retainer of $1,000 to $50,000 to reserve this ability and then pay between $5,000 and $20,000 a day while the space is used, said John A. Jackson, Comdisco's executive vice president for operations, who is based in Chicago.

HEADLINE: Better Budget Priorities

 BODY:
President Clinton has asked Congress to vote on the broad outlines of unpopular spending cuts and tax increases before it gets to the more appetizing business of spending money and awarding tax breaks to boost the economy. It's an encouraging sign that Washington may be getting the voters' message to stop fooling around on the deficit.
Given Congress's past behavior, there has been justifiable suspicion that it might move quickly on easy parts of his plans -- the added spending and tax breaks in the stimulus package -- and then drag its feet on distasteful spending cuts and higher income and energy taxes. The new order of voting at least gives the appearance of tackling the tough measures first. The proof will be in the final legislation later this year. 
 Putting a positive spin on the revised schedule, the White House asserts that this puts the budget on a "fast track." It commits Congress to vote by April 2 on the annual budget resolution that sets broad guidelines for later legislation to support roughly $1.5 trillion of spending and some $1.2 trillion in taxes. While that's a useful speed-up of several weeks, the bills that eventually become law will still take months to write.
But perhaps more significant than speeding the budget vote, the new timetable postpones voting that had been planned for mid-March on the President's stimulus package. This vote will now come quickly after the budget resolution, but not before.
The delay means, of course, that whatever stimulus the package might deliver will come later than the Administration wanted. It also means that Republicans and others who claim the package is unnecessarily generous will have longer to make their case heard.
The budget debate may also become tangled in a partisan battle over raising the ceiling on the national debt -- an upcoming nuisance piece of legislation that's easily made into a political football.
The loudest criticism of the President's priorities comes, of course, from Congressional Republicans. But members of both parties in Congress's exceptionally large freshman class have pressed for more deficit discipline. Newly elected members are refreshingly more concerned than some of their veteran colleagues in seeing that deficit reduction is genuine and not just a charade.
There is reason to believe that those freshmen are in closer touch with public sentiment than people who have been around Washington a long time. Opinion polls continue to show substantial support for Mr. Clinton's proposals, even the taxes. With the new timetable for action, both Mr. Clinton and the leaders of Congress indicate that they hear.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
The Two Societies

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
"In light of the sorry history of discrimination and its devastating impact on the lives of Negroes, bringing the Negro into the mainstream of American life should be a state interest of the highest order. To fail to do so is to ensure that America will remain forever a divided society."
-- Justice Thurgood Marshall in Regents v. Bakke, 1978.
 Twenty-five years ago today the Kerner Commission, appointed by President Johnson after terrible riots in Detroit and Newark the year before, made its final report. Gov. Otto Kerner and his colleagues warned: "Our Nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white -- separate and unequal." 
 For the anniversary, the Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation has issued a massive report on what we must do about the miseries of our urban ghettoes -- the miseries that exploded again last year in the Los Angeles riots. It is a valuable report because it refuses to accept what so many Americans have come to believe: that there is nothing to be done about the poverty, decay and crime of our inner cities.
The report, written by the foundation's president, Lynn A. Curtis, concludes that the Kerner Commission's vision of two unequal Americas is "more relevant today than in 1968, and more complex, with the emergence of multiracial disparities and growing income segregation." But it does not see this reality as a reason to give up.
"The fact is," the report says, "that we already know quite a bit about which investments work in the American inner city."
The focus of the report is on helping children and youth avoid the dead ends of ignorance and crime. It argues that a number of community-based programs in different cities have proved successful, and that it is time to apply their methods on a larger scale.
The methods include "sanctuary, extended family, mentoring . . . discipline, educational innovation that motivates a youth to obtain a high school degree, job training linked to job placement . . ." To spread those ideas the report proposes a national nonprofit Corporation for Youth Investment, funded by both private sources and the Federal Government.
Among many other proposals, one is for a National Community Development Bank. It would encourage a network of development banks like the South Shore Bank in Chicago, which has had much success in stemming urban decay -- and has been profitable.
To finance its suggestions, the report calls for a gradual rise in Federal spending to a level of $15 billion a year in new money for investment in children and youth, and $15 billion for investment in inner cities themselves. Those levels, it says, should continue for 10 years.
I asked Roger Wilkins, a leading black analyst of urban problems who was sent by President Johnson to help deal with the Detroit riot in 1967, what he thought of the report. He welcomed its insistence that we must act and that we know a good deal about what to do.
"But I don't believe," Mr. Wilkins added, "that any social program in the world can do for a child what a healthy, economically steady family can do. So you have to strengthen families. That means focusing on job creation. You need income for families, earned income. Job training and placement should be centered on the aim of strengthening families."
If we recognize that necessity, we have to confront another contemporary reality: the decline of manufacturing industry in this country with the globalization of production. Strengthening the family in inner cities is dependent in that sense on President Clinton's aim of rebuilding American industry to create jobs.
There is one more aspect of the Eisenhower Foundation report that must be noted. After quoting the famous Kerner conclusion about two societies, the report has very little to say directly about race. That may reflect a political judgment.
Few white Americans want to think about remedial measures for the black heirs of centuries of discrimination. Reagan and Bush political strategy was to arouse racial fears, and then use them as a reason to do nothing. But a divided America, damaging to whites as to blacks, will continue until we face the issue of race.

HEADLINE: Europe's Medical Model

BYLINE: By Philip R. Lee and Richard D. Lamm; Philip R. Lee is director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. Richard D. Lamm, former Governor of Colorado, is director of the Center for Public Policy and Contemporary Issues at the University of Denver.

 BODY:
Other industrialized countries have succeeded far better than the United States in controlling rising health care costs. Between 1982 and 1989, six big European countries actually reduced the proportion of the gross domestic product spent on health care. In others, the proportion was either unchanged or the increase was small. Obviously someone is doing something right.
Prof. Brian Abel-Smith of the London School of Economics studied these countries' success. The key, he concluded, is a government effort, through regulation or strict budgets, aimed not at demand but at supply -- the supply of doctors, hospital beds and medical technology and procedures. Controlling the number of CAT scan machines in a particular region, for instance, eliminates overlap and promotes efficiency. 
 By contrast, the overcapacity of U.S. health care adds significantly to costs. We have too many doctors, particularly specialists, who perform too many procedures. Advanced medical technology is overused, and there has been little reduction in the oversupply of hospital beds.
We all must pay for this infrastructure -- in insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs and indirectly through taxes and inflated hospital costs. Because nine-tenths of hospital bills and three-quarters of doctors' fees are paid for by third parties (insurance or government), competition doesn't work. We seldom shop for what we don't pay for directly. As Rashi Fein, a Harvard economist, observed, "In health care, the invisible hand of Adam Smith is all thumbs."
Most European countries train 20 to 40 percent of their doctors as specialists; in the U.S., the number of doctors who specialize is approaching 80 percent of the total. Specialists charge more and order more tests and procedures. At least 40 percent of U.S. hospital beds are empty at any given time, despite well-publicized shortages in some cities.
The U.S. has half the world's CAT scan machines and two-thirds of the magnetic resonance imaging machines. California has at least 400 M.R.I. machines, while Canada, about the same size, has about 20.
Nationwide, 850 hospitals perform open-heart surgery. About half do fewer than the minimum number required by the Federal Health Care Financing Administration.
In California, 110 hospitals have units for open-heart surgery, but about two-thirds do not do enough operations to meet the Federal standards. Many of these hospitals perform heart operations less than once a week on average. Generally, this means that patients run an increased risk because proficiency comes with practice.
Some cities like St. Paul, Minn., and Rochester, N.Y., have tightly controlled medical facilities and enjoy considerable savings.
The Government can and must regulate the unrestricted growth of medical technology. Much of our complex technology -- coronary bypass surgery, for example, and organ transplants -- must be placed selectively.
New procedures and machines must be shown to be safe and cost effective before they are widely used. And the number of specialists can be controlled: The Europeans limit the number of doctors in one specialty by picking the most talented applicants and turning others away.
Nationwide, enough money is wasted to insure the 37 million Americans who lack coverage. Health care reform will occupy a big part of the Government's attention for years. But one achievable early success could be to follow Europe's example.

HEADLINE: Lillian Gish, 99, a Movie Star Since Movies Began, is Dead

BYLINE: By ALBIN KREBS

 BODY:
Lillian Gish, the last of the great silent film stars, who performed for more than 85 years in movies, theater and television, died in her sleep on Saturday evening at her home in Manhattan. She was 99 years old.
Her personal manager, James E. Frasher, said the cause was heart failure. 
 "She was the same age as film," Mr. Frasher said. "They both came into the world in 1893."
Miss Gish was still performing as recently as the late 1980's. In 1986, she appeared as Alan Alda's hilariously addled mother in "Sweet Liberty," and in 1987 she was widely praised for her sensitive portrayal of an indomitable old woman in "The Whales of August," which co-starred another movie legend, Bette Davis.
 
Advocate of an Early Start
 "To become an actress, one cannot begin too soon," said Miss Gish, and she meant it, for she had made her acting debut at the age of 5.
Under the guidance of the director D. W. Griffith, Miss Gish became the pre-eminent actress in silent films, appearing in classics like "The Birth of a Nation," "Intolerance," "Broken Blossoms" and "Way Down East."
After performing in dozens of one- and two-reel silent movies (with running times of 10 or 20 minutes) and then in the longer Griffith epics, Miss Gish made a successful transition to the "talkies," and later into television.
Between film and television roles, she also worked on the stage. In 1930 she starred as Helena in Jed Harris's Broadway production of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya," and in 1973 she appeared as the nurse in Mike Nichols's revival of the play. She made her last Broadway appearance in 1975, in "A Musical Jubilee."
Especially in her youth, Miss Gish evoked an aura of fragility, and hers was a vulnerable waiflike beauty. The renowned theatrical impresario David Belasco pronounced her "the most beautiful blonde I have ever seen." George Jean Nathan, the Broadway critic who courted Miss Gish without success for more than a decade, compared her to Eleonora Duse.
Miss Gish, though not always in excellent health, was accustomed to hard work and took a no-nonsense view of her physical attributes.
"I didn't care about being a beauty," she said in an interview in 1975. "I wanted to be an actress. When I was in the movies, I didn't care what I looked like, except for that image up there on the screen. I wanted to create beauty when it was necessary; that's an inner thing. But if all you have is a facade, it isn't interesting."
Throughout her life Miss Gish remained singularly devoted to her mother and to her sister, Dorothy, who was younger, but who became an actress at about the same time Lillian did. Mrs. Gish died in 1948 after a long invalidism, and Dorothy Gish died in 1968.
Miss Gish, who never married and who leaves no survivors, finally rejected Mr. Nathan's long series of marriage proposals, and said that a primary reason was his "seeming resentment" of her devotion to her family. She gave another reason for staying single: "Actresses have no business marrying. I always felt that being a successful wife was a 24-hour-a-day job. Besides, I knew such charming men: perhaps I didn't want to disillusion any of them."
Lillian Diana Gish, a daughter of the former Mary Robinson McConnell and James Gish, was born on Oct. 14, 1893, in Springfield, Ohio. The family moved to Baltimore, where Mr. Gish became a partner in a candy store. Before the turn of the century, he abandoned his wife and two daughters. He died in 1911.
Mrs. Gish took her daughters to New York City, rented an apartment on West 34th Street that was large enough to include two boarders, and began working in a department store. When Lillian was 5, a Gish boarder, an actress named Alice Niles, persuaded Mrs. Gish to let her take the child with her to act in a production of "In Convict's Stripes," which played one-night stands across the country. Lillian's salary was $10 a week.
At the age of 4, Dorothy joined another touring troupe; so did Mrs. Gish. The Gishes were separated at least half of each year, and life was lonely for Lillian as she traveled constantly and shared squalid hotel rooms with other company members to save money. More than once, she nearly fell into the hands of Elbridge Gerry's Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which was dedicated to protecting children who worked in sweatshop factories as well as on the stage.
When the Gishes were together in New York, they shared quarters with Charlotte Smith, whose daughter Gladys was a bit player on Broadway. Lillian won the role of a dancer, a part that Gladys had hoped for, in Sarah Bernhardt's 1905 engagement on Broadway.
 
She Knew Pickford As Gladys Smith
 In 1909, while visiting friends in Baltimore, Lillian and Dorothy dropped in to see a short film called "Lena and the Geese," and immediately recognized its star as Gladys Smith. The next year the sisters showed up at the Biograph film studios in Manhattan, at 11 East 14th Street, and asked to see Miss Smith.
That very day Gladys Smith, who had changed her name to Mary Pickford, introduced the Gishes to D. W. Griffith, who at that time was churning out at least three one-reelers a week for Biograph.
He took the sisters to a rehearsal hall, where he produced a revolver and began to shoot over their heads. He later explained that he wanted to see how they reacted. They evidently passed the fear test, for within hours they were playing small roles in "An Unseen Enemy." Each received $5.
That was the beginning of an artistic collaboration between Lillian Gish and Griffith that lasted more than a decade. During that time Miss Gish appeared in dozens of Griffith's short films and starred in most of his critically and economically successful longer ones.
In some films she played bit parts; in others, she played several roles. Sometimes she was the star. All of Griffith's Biograph actors were moved around in this way: it was not until after the success of "The Birth of a Nation" that any received on-screen credit.
 
One Source of Pride: Doing Own Stunts
 Miss Gish was proud of the fact that she became an accomplished horseback rider, and performed her own stunts in dangerous scenes. She also learned to edit film, set up lights and pick costumes, and she directed two films for Biograph, one of which starred her sister, Dorothy.
During most of her years with Griffith, Miss Gish and the rest of the Griffith company of actors and technicians divided their time between New York and Los Angeles. In 1913, when Griffith joined Mutual Productions, Miss Gish, her sister and many other artists at Biograph moved with him. Miss Gish starred in his first Mutual film, "The Battle of the Sexes," in 1914.
Securing financial backing for "The Birth of a Nation," a Civil War epic and a milestone in the history of the motion picture, was a major battle for Griffith, for the movie's costs constantly outstripped the budget estimates. It was said to have cost $300,000.
First released in February 1915, under the title "The Clansman," the film ran an unheard-of two hours and was shown at first in only a handful of road-show theaters, to the musical accompaniment of a 30-piece orchestra. Customers paid $2 to see what soon became known as "The Birth of a Nation." Despite the high admission price, the picture was a great hit.
"In it I played Elsie, the sweet and virginal daughter of the family around which the action was built," Miss Gish said in 1975. "I played so many frail, downtrodden little virgins in the films of my youth that I sometimes think I invented that stereotype of a role."
Miss Gish's role in Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916) was small. Griffith had envisioned the film as his ultimate contribution to the motion-picture art, but he was forced to trim it drastically on the insistence of his creditors. Many other stars of the day, including Constance Talmadge, Bessie Love and Erich von Stroheim, made brief appearances.
 
Propaganda Films For World War I
 During World War I, the Gish sisters went with Griffith to Europe to make propaganda films, among them the immensely successful "Hearts of the World" (1918). By that time, Griffith had joined Adolph Zukor's company, which later became Paramount Pictures.
Hendrick Sartov, the still photographer for "Hearts of the World," eventually became a cinematographer for Griffith and invented for Miss Gish the "Lillian Gish lens," now called a soft-focus lens, which gives its subject a warmly blurred appearance.
In the fall of 1919, Griffith moved his entire company to Mamaroneck, N.Y., where he built his own movie studio on a huge estate. It was there, and on locations in New England, that he filmed Miss Gish's popular melodrama "Way Down East," released in 1920.
Miss Gish wrote in her autobiography that she volunteered to perform the dangerous climactic scene in that film, in which the heroine, lying on the ice floe in a freezing river, is headed for almost certain doom over a waterfall.
The frail-looking Miss Gish lay on the floe, her hair and one of her hands trailing in the frigid water. "My face was caked with a crust of snow and ice, and little spikes formed on my eyelashes, making it difficult to keep my eyes open," she recalled. "It was a delicious scene, one of my really favorites, but I remember being cold for days afterward."
"Orphans of the Storm," a French-Revolution melodrama released in 1922, was Griffith's last financially successful picture and, perhaps not coincidentally, the last Miss Gish made for him. "With all the expenses I have, I can't afford to pay you what you're worth," he told her. "You should go out on your own."
With heavy investments of her own money, she then made two successful movies in Italy, "The White Sister" and "Romola."
In the mid-1920's Miss Gish became embroiled in a long legal battle with Charles Duell, a socialite who had been her financial adviser (and, as she said in 1975, "sort of my Svengali"), over sums he claimed she owed him. Miss Gish munched carrots during the trial, and newspaper photographs of her stirred a carrot-chomping fad across the country.
Americans had become enchanted with the new artistic aristocracy, made up of movie stars like Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Rudolph Valentino and Miss Gish. Earlier, in a movie, when Miss Gish had pushed up the sides of her mouth with her fingers to demonstrate feigned happiness, the gesture became a much-copied fad.
 
From the Silents To the Talkies
 Miss Gish made the transition from silents to talkies in 1930 in "One Romantic Night," with Rod LaRocque and Conrad Nagel. By that time, she had signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. "My contract called for six pictures in two years, for which I was paid, I believe, a million dollars," she wrote.
Miss Gish made a triumphant return to the stage in 1930 in "Uncle Vanya" on Broadway. In 1936 she played Ophelia to John Gielgud's Hamlet and Judith Anderson's Queen Gertrude, and in 1941 she began a record-breaking 66-week run in "Life With Father" in Chicago. In 1960, she starred in "All the Way Home" on Broadway.
As Miss Gish grew older, roles were more difficult to come by, but she played in summer stock and in an occasional movie, like "The Comedians," "The Night of the Hunter" and "The Undefeated." An early recruit to television, she appeared in "Arsenic and Old Lace" with Helen Hayes and in Horton Foote's "Trip to Bountiful."
Commenting on what was to be Miss Gish's last screen performance, in the 1987 "Whales of August," Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times: "There's not a gesture or a line-reading that doesn't reflect her nearly three-quarters of a century in front of a camera. Scenes are not purloined when she's on screen."

HEADLINE: CRISIS AT THE TWIN TOWERS;
Businesses Plan to Carry On After Explosion

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Officials announced yesterday that the twin towers of the World Trade Center would be closed for at least a week, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo asked the Federal Government to make low-interest loans available to small businesses affected by the bombing in a center garage on Friday.
In a race to prepare for the work week, executives and workers at the huge financial center in lower Manhattan yesterday turned their aplomb and ingenuity to finding ways to carry on business in temporary quarters. 
 Officials of the five commodities exchanges were granted permission to reopen this morning in one of the center's smaller buildings, dodging what would have been a major blow to the nation's businesses. The big brokerage houses in the trade center, which was damaged by a bomb on Friday, also said they had arranged alternative locations that will allow them to keep working. [Page D1.]
But many small firms, as well as restaurants and shops near the seven-building complex, faced grave uncertainty and the possibility of devastating financial losses. Some neighborhood fast-food stores were already cutting their staffs, expecting lower Manhattan to look like a ghost town today.
City and state officials said they expected larger firms to be more resilient. They said they did not anticipate lasting devastation to the city's economy or a flight of panicked tenants from the complex.
 
'Pretty Severe'
 "The impact on small businesses could be pretty severe, and we recognize that," said Richard C. Leone, the chairman of the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. But he added, "I think it's a mistake to say this is an economic disaster for New York, the region or the country."
Two days after thousands of people fled from the smoke-filled buildings, trade center tenants yesterday milled about in the marble lobby of a nearby building where Port Authority officials had opened a command center. Working on folding tables, officials tried to find alternative arrangements for affected businesses, while some workers were being escorted to their offices by police officers to retrieve vital documents and computer files.
While four buildings of the seven-building complex will be reopening today, the two 110-story towers will be closed, and there was still considerable confusion about where many of the 55,000 people who work in the center were to go this morning.
Anne Compoccio, the supervisor of the mailroom at the engineering company Ebasco Inc. said she had told the 18 employees who work for her to stand by for instructions. In the meantime, she planned to pick up the company mail, usually five or six bags, at the post office. "Either I'll take it to the Lindenhurst office, or I'll sort it out at my house," she said. "We have to go on. We can't let this stop us."
The Aetna Life and Casualty Company, which had 350 employees at 2 World Trade Center, found itself in the unusual position of handling its own crisis instead of everyone else's. "We have a lot of experience with natural catastrophes -- hurricanes, earthquakes," said Stephen M. Wasdick, a company spokesman. "It's so unusual for us to have a man-made disaster that affects our own employees."
He said customers would notice no difference, with calls rerouted to the company's Long Island offices in Garden City and Lake Success. But the executives had not yet decided where to send workers.
State and city officials declined to estimate the extent of losses from the devastation, beyond acknowledging that it would be in the millions of dollars. But after canvassing almost all of the 350 tenants of the complex, they said none had said they were so traumatized that they wanted to move. "We haven't heard that from one business," said Vincent Tese, the state Commissioner of Economic Development. "Their question is, 'When are we going to get back in.' "
The World Trade Center contains 10 percent of lower Manhattan's office space and some of its biggest corporate names. Each normal business day it is flooded by 55,000 workers and 80,000 visitors.
Governor Cuomo asked the Federal Small Business Administration to make available federally guaranteed loans of up to $500,000 for small businesses at the center.
"New York City's economy has been hit with a serious blow as a result of the explosion at the World Trade Center," he said in a statement. "The severity of this disaster warrants Federal assistance." The governor made the request for help in a letter to Michael B. Forbes, the regional administrator of the agency.
Besides the commodity exchanges, which set prices on everything from gold to cotton and heating oil, Mr. Tese said other key tenants would also be operating, including all of the businesses in 7 World Trade Center. He said the brokerage house Salomon Brothers would be open and Cantor Fitzgerald, the bond trader critical to the United States bond market, would be allowed to return to tower No. 1.
The Port Authority, with city and state officials, is searching for temporary space for the other tenants. Mr. Tese said the officials are relocating some firms at 7 World Trade Center and the Teleport on Staten Island. He also noted that there is more than one million square feet of vacant space, much of it usable, in Manhattan.
New York Telephone, anticipating an enormous demand for telephone service, began contacting trade center clients over the weekend. "This is going to be a wild scene tomorrow," said Doug Mello, New York Telephone's group vice president for Manhattan. "So we're getting ourselves organized to try to accommodate priority requests for these customers if they want to go to another location."
Mr. Mello said the company already had requests for 1,000 telephone lines and 100 data transmission lines. Telephone company officials said most phone lines were being re-routed through computers at New York Telephone's central office.
Many seemed determined to prove the observation of Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, that "New York above all is a town with tremendous resilience."
Thomas R. Smith Jr., a member of the executive committee of the law firm Brown, Wood, Ivey, Mitchell & Perry, spent Friday marching down more than 50 flights of stairs at 1 World Trade Center, with his mobile phone. When he and members of his law firm hit billows of smoke on the 18th floor, he telephoned police for further directions.
Yesterday he and other partners were making plans to move some of their 208 attorneys to a borrowed conference room in Fairlawn, N.J., and negotiating for more space with Olympia & York. But asked if the firm was considering relocating from the World Trade Center for good, he said, "We haven't gotten into that. We're very happy there."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about the effects of the World Trade Center explosion on businesses described an appeal for Federal assistance incorrectly in some copies, as did the headline. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo asked for low-interest Federal loans to be made available to small businesses; he did not ask the Clinton Administration to declare New York an economic disaster area.

HEADLINE: FOOD STAMP USERS UP SHARPLY IN SIGN OF WEAK RECOVERY

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
The number of food stamp recipients surged in 1992, with more than one person in 10 now receiving the assistance, meaning that a higher percentage of Americans now use the program than at any time since it began in 1964.
The percentage is higher even than at the end of the 1982 recession and analysts said the number reported today by the Agriculture Department underscored the weakness of the current economic recovery for those at the financial bottom. 
 Food stamps helped feed 26.6 million Americans in December, or 10.4 percent of the population. By contrast, 9.6 percent of the country was enrolled in the program at the end of the 1982 recession.
The discouraging numbers on food stamp recipients was the latest in a string of so-so economic reports. And the burst of post-election optimism about the economy, reflected in rising stock prices and consumer confidence, has given way to fresh anxiety about the staying power of the expansion. [Page D1.]
 
Sharp Increases
 After remaining stable for most of the 1980's, the number of Americans using food stamps has risen 36 percent in the last three years. The cost of the program has soared even more sharply, by 53 percent, to more than $23 billion.
Noting that food stamp figures typically run parallel to the number of unemployed people, analysts said the statistics support President Clinton's contention that the economic recovery, which began in April 1991, is a weak one.
"It further indicates that, at least as of December, the economic recovery had not reached very far into the low-income population," said Robert Greenstein, a director of the food stamp program in the Carter Administration. He now runs the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group.
 
Other Factors Involved
 Andy Hornsby, the acting administrator of the food stamp program, said he agreed that the rise was primarily driven by the weak economy.
But he also noted that the rolls always increase in the winter when seasonal workers are unemployed. And Mr. Hornbsy said that expanded eligibility rules in other programs, especially Medicaid, were attracting more people to social services offices. "As people come in for one program, they tend to apply for other benefits for which they're eligible," he said.
Eligibility rules for the food stamp program have not changed in recent years. To qualify, a recipient's income cannot exceed 130 percent of the Federal poverty line. That means a family of four could not earn more than $18,101 and a single person under 65 could not earn more than $9,211. In addition, a family cannot have savings of more than $2,000.
The previous peak, when 9.6 percent of Americans relied on the program, occurred in March 1983, four months after the official end of the 1982 recession. The number of people on food stamps then fell off sharply, as economic growth took hold. But it has been 21 months since the official end of the latest recession, and the food stamp rolls are still expanding.
In the first 21 months of the last economic recovery, the number of unemployed Americans fell by 3.4 million, Mr. Greenstein said. By contrast, in the past 21 months of recovery, the number of unemployed has actually risen, by 818,000.
 
A Note of Pessimism
 The discouraging gauge of economic health stands in contrast to some optimistic recent reports on economic growth. Last week the Commerce Department reported that the gross domestic product grew by 4.8 percent in the last quarter of 1992.
But while the overall economy is growing, unemployment rates have come down more slowly than they have during previous recessions. The unemployment rate was 7.3 percent in December 1992, higher than at any time during 1990 or 1991, and down only modestly from its 1992 high of 7.7 percent in June.
Mr. Greenstein said that the number of long-term unemployed had not declined at all, remaining at slightly more than two million in both June and December of 1992. He defined the long-term unemployed as those who been unemployed for 27 weeks or longer.
"This recovery differs significantly in the small number of jobs being created and the limited progress to date in reducing unemployment rates," said Mr. Greenstein.
The record number of food stamp recipients comes in part because many people have exhausted their savings and therefore qualify for Government help, he said.
Studies have found that only about 60 percent of those who qualify for food stamps sign up to get them. The remainder either do not know they qualify, or shun the program for fear of being stigmatized.
Program officials said that 20 percent of the heads of families on food stamps are employed and 7 percent work full time. Another 7 percent are elderly.
It is much easier to qualify for food stamps than for many other social programs, including Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main Federal cash assistance program.
There are about 13.5 million Americans receiving A.F.D.C., approximately half the number on food stamps. There are about 36 million Americans living below the poverty line.
The number of people receiving food stamps has risen in every region of the country, with the West showing the sharpest gain. In that region, the number of people on the food stamp rolls has jumped by nearly 10 percent in the last year. The Midwest had the slowest rise, of 3 percent.
In New York and Connecticut, food stamp rolls grew 8 percent over the past year, and in New Jersey the program grew 7 percent. The Federal Government pays for all food stamp benefits; in contrast, it shares the cost of the A.F.D.C. program with the states.
The cost of the program is rising even faster than its enrollment, partly because of inflation in the price of food. But it also reflects sagging incomes among some of those previously enrolled, because the less a family earns, the more food stamps it receives. The maximum benefit for a family of four is $370 a month; the average family benefit in 1992 was $173.
Mr. Greenstein predicted the food stamp rolls would remain at record levels through March, when they typically reach their yearly peak. The numbers usually declinein the summer, but Mr. Greenstein said he doubted they would reach their pre-recession levels anytime soon.

HEADLINE: MUCH BOSNIAN AID MISSED ITS TARGET

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 1

 BODY:
Two-thirds of the relief supplies dropped overnight Sunday into a besieged area of Bosnia and Herzegovina may have failed to reach hungry civilians, and some may have fallen into the hands of Serbian fighters, United States officials said today.
Using satellite photographs, the officials said they had determined that one-third of the bundles, parachuted from high altitudes, had reached their intended destination in a mountainous and partly wooded area within walking distance of Cerska, in eastern Bosnia. 
 But around Cerska, doubts were raised that even one-third of the supplies had reached the intended target. Surveys of radio operators in eastern Bosnia, for example, failed to turn up a single one who knew of a pallet's being recovered from the first United States airdrop.
[Three Air Force cargo planes dropped tons of food and medical supplies over eastern Bosnia again early Tuesday, The Associated Press quoted the military as saying. "The airdrop missions were completed without incident," said a statement from Rhein-Main Air Base, the American installation outside Frankfurt.
[The statement said the target of the second airdrop was the town of Zepa, which had been designated a high priority location by the United Nations. The planes dropped 18.6 tons of food, amounting to 21,312 meals, and a half ton of medical supplies, the Air Force said.]
 
Some Land Near Serbian Forces
 In Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, a Vice President, Zlatko Lagumdzija, said this evening that the supplies from the first airdrop were in the hands of Serbian units besieging Cerska. The Serbian commander in Bosnia, Gen. Ratko Mladic, confirmed that at least some supplies had landed in areas controlled by his troops.
Pentagon officials in Washington said it was not clear where the bundles that were not seen in satellite photographs had landed. They said it was possible some had landed in or near the drop area but had not been seen.
"The airdrop was successful," Defense Secretary Les Aspin and Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a joint statement. "We can confirm that many of the bundles landed in clear areas within the identified drop zone," they added, and "the other bundles landed in or near the drop zone, but we are unable to confirm exact landing points."
From the beginning, the Administration has acknowledged that the purpose of the airdrop was more political than humanitarian, and that the intention was to bring the warring factions to the negotiating table.
Pentagon officials also chose to drop supplies from 10,000 feet, knowing that much of the food and medicine might not reach its destination. Today, however, United States officials seemed troubled by reports that only a small portion of the aid might have been delivered to those in need.
The planes were buffeted by strong winds over the drop site, which one Pentagon official said was only about 1,000 feet by 2,000 feet.
 
No Ethnic Criteria
 The operation is intended mainly for the estimated 200,000 Muslims under siege by Serbian nationalist forces, but United States officials, anxious to avoid the appearance of partiality, say they want to supply civilians of all ethnic backgrounds.
The airdrops are expected to continue on an almost nightly basis, with three to five planes each.
A military spokesman, acknowledging the problems, said: "Some may have fallen on the Serb side, and some may have gone to previously Muslim areas that were just captured by the Serbs. Some may have gone into the mountains or places people can't get to.
"What would be ideal is if we could get a call from someone in Bosnia who would tell us, 'I'm eating one of your meals and it tastes good.' So far we haven't heard anything like that."
 
The Target, the Cargo
 Although United States and United Nations officials at first refused to say where the supplies for the first airdrop had been dropped, several said later that the three planes were aiming at Cerska.
Reports from Cerska said no aid was received there. A radio operator there speculated that flight crews might have been misled by fires in a Serbian-controlled zone.
"Houses were burning in some of the recently captured territory," said the operator, known as Edin. "Maybe they thought it was a signal to drop there."
Military spokesmen in Frankfurt said the planes dropped a total of three 760-pound crates of medicine, mostly first-aid items like gauze and bandages, and 27 crates of food.
Even before the mission, current and former Pentagon officials cautioned that the standard procedure for an airdrop is to do it at low altitude, in daylight, with spotters on the ground; the Bosnian airdrop failed on all three counts.
But General Powell insisted that the airdrops be carried out at high altitude to minimize the risk to the crews from antiaircraft weapons.
 
Praise From Europeans
 Despite the uncertainties, many European politicians and commentators praised the airdrop. But in some capitals, including London and Paris, praise was mixed with suggestions that the operation was aimed as much at publicity as at assistance to hard-pressed civilians.
"The British and other Europeans are wrong to be quite so sniffy about the exercise," said The Independent, a leading British daily, in an editorial. "The effort will have value if some people are fed who would otherwise have starved."
Several newspapers said Washington was taking the lead because Europe had failed to do so.
"Although one can argue about the long-term value of this relief operation, it is clear that the phase of helplessly lamenting the death and starvation of human beings is over," said one of Germany's largest newspapers, Die Welt, in a front-page commentary. "The American action came not a day too soon. It puts western Europe to shame."
Germany praised the operation, and according to senior German officials Bonn may decide as early as Wednesday to offer direct support.
The French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, defended European governments against charges of inaction.
"It's a good thing the Americans have joined the Europeans in an affair that interests the whole world," Mr. Dumas said in a radio interview. "Bravo! The Americans have come to lend a hand. But let's not forget what the Europeans are doing." Many of the United Nations peacekeeping troops, who face considerable personal risk, are from NATO countries.
Few analysts expect the airdrops to alter the balance of power in the Balkans, or even to feed large numbers of people. They say that even if the airdrops are successful, they will not help Bosnia's besieged Muslims.
"The delivery of large amounts of food does not change the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina," said the Prague newspaper Mlada Fronta. "Politicians are still not able to answer the most important question, which is whether the Muslims will be able to survive anywhere.
"It requires only a normal amount of cynicism to realize that within a certain time, we will see thousands more Bosnians forced from their homes as a result of ethnic cleansing. But now they will have full stomachs and American chewing gum in their pockets."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Serbian Leadership Silent
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, March 1 (Special to The New York Times) -- The United States airdrop of relief supplies in eastern Bosnia signaled a new phase of international involvement in the Balkan war. But the Serbian leadership, which has been blamed for the worst of the violence, let the step pass without comment.
The Government-controlled television reported on the mission and quoted European newspapers warning of the possible dangers, but there was no official comment from the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic.
"I think people generally understand the move as a sign of growing American military involvement," said Predrag Simic, director of the Institute of International Politics and Economics, which is close to the Yugoslav federal Government.
"I doubt whether the aid will have much practical effect," he said. "But it could have the effect of dragging the Americans into further fighting. All three sides have reason to try to shoot down a plane because whoever actually did it, the Serbs would be blamed."
Svetozar Stojanovic, a foreign policy adviser to Dobrica Cosic, the President of Yugoslavia, said Mr. Cosic had asked Army commanders not to fire at the C-130 cargo planes.

HEADLINE: Senior American at U.N. Leaves, Trading Accusations With Chief

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 1

 BODY:
The senior American on the staff of the United Nations stepped down from his post today, though not without a final barbed exchange with the man who dismissed him.
Dick Thornburgh, a former United States Attorney General whose post is to be filled by a Clinton Administration nominee, surrendered the position of Under Secretary General for Administration and Management, releasing a report listing what he sees as the United Nations' administrative weaknesses and blaming some on Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
 In his report, Mr. Thornburgh accused the Secretary General of weakening staff morale by downgrading officials in his department and undermining efforts to improve efficiency by not allowing him to dismiss unneeded employees.
"Managers simply must be allowed to terminate those not measuring up to 'the highest standards of competence and integrity' contemplated by the Charter," he wrote.
 
Consulting Contracts Faulted
 Mr. Thornburgh also criticized the Secretary General for awarding "costly consulting contracts to high-level officials following their retirement or termination of services."
And he attacked his decision to split up the organization's economic and social work among three new Under Secretaries General, telling Mr. Boutros-Ghali the decision "compromised your laudable goal of reducing the number of high-level appointments."
He also called for the appointment of an inspector general to investigate "fraud, waste and abuse" by United Nations staff, dismissing the Joint Inspection Unit, which is supposed to perform this function, as ineffectual.
But the Secretary General replied pointedly through his spokesman that while he appreciated the report, he also wished Mr. Thornburgh had done more to correct these deficiencies while he was in a position to do so instead of complaining about them now.
 
Criticism Is Returned
 "This is the first written report of this type he has received from Mr. Thornburgh during his tenure," the Secretary General's spokesman, Joe Sills, said today. "It is thus the first time the Secretary General has seen a number of these proposals or comments that Mr. Thornburgh has made. Of course he welcomes and appreciates them. But he does also feel that perhaps some of them could have been dealt with during the past year, during Mr. Thornburgh's tenure."
Shortly after taking office, Mr. Boutros-Ghali said he wanted the very top posts in the organization to be "political," meaning that those who filled them would be appointed by him and would serve at his pleasure.
But by failing to renew Mr. Thornburgh's one-year contract and agreeing to give his post to a Clinton Administration nominee, the Secretary General has now implicitly accepted that the incumbent Administration in Washington has the right to fill one of these top slots.
The Secretary General had wanted the incoming Administration to swap posts, suggesting that instead of the United Nations' chief administrator, it name the Under Secretary General in charge of information, who would be Mr. Boutros-Ghali's personal spokesman. But President Clinton felt it would be easier for him to keep his pledge to pay America's United Nations dues if he can tell Congressional skeptics that an American is overseeing administration and management.

HEADLINE: CRISIS AT THE TWIN TOWERS: The Overview;
INQUIRY IS PRESSED ON CAUSE OF BLAST AT TRADE CENTER

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
Federal and local authorities combed parking receipts, reviewed videotapes from an underground parking garage and examined intelligence files yesterday for clues to the explosion that killed at least five people at the World Trade Center on Friday.
Although investigators were still unable to answer the two central questions -- what kind of bomb caused the blast and who set it off -- Federal officials said they were beginning to focus more heavily on the possibility of the explosion being the work of foreign terrorists. 
 Law-enforcement and intelligence officials said they had information suggesting a possible Serbian connection to the bombing, although there was no indication that any Serbian suspects have emerged. "Someone with Yugoslavian connections has come up," said one law-enforcement official.
Investigators also were reviewing about 30 thefts of explosive material of at least 300 pounds each around the country in the last four years.
 
Many Workers Return
 The investigation continued as New York City worked to return to the normal routine shattered by the blast on Friday, and the Federal Government said it would help ease the economic pain with Small Business Administration loans. Although the twin towers at the Trade Center will probably remain closed for at least a week, about a third of the 50,000 workers at the entire complex were back on their jobs.
Transportation was nearly normal, with commuter traffic lighter than usual, and restaurant, theater and hotel business apparently unaffected. But a certain nervousness remained: 95 bomb threats around New York City were reported yesterday by 6 P.M., more than nine times the normal total.
In downtown Brooklyn, four bomb threats caused evacuation of thousands of workers, creating huge traffic tie-ups for most of the morning. Mayor David N. Dinkins and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly met with security personnel of major corporations, calling for calm but urging them to re-examine their security plans.
The Small Business Administration approved emergency help to hundreds of small businesses that have been affected by the blast, many of which may qualify for low-interest loans of up to $500,000 to cover expenses. Other interest-free loans were being made available through the state's Urban Development Corporation. Other agencies were directed to expedite claims of those victimized by the blast and others thrown out of work.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo vowed to be the first tenant to return to the complex and hailed the city's spirit as a triumph over adversity. President Clinton, in New Jersey, took the occasion to rally New Yorkers and "discourage the American people from overreacting to this." He said he was urging New Yorkers "to keep your courage up and go about your lives."
The authorities said a second World Trade Center employee has now not been accounted for. They identified him as King McGee Jr., 55, who works for California Bank. Mr. McGee's neighbors described him as a kindly, generous man and said his son had been to their building on West 145h Street yesterday, asking if anyone had seen him.
Despite the continuing reluctance of police and Federal officials to discuss the investigation, several new developments emerged yesterday.
 
An Unusual Twist
 In one unusual twist, after days of accounts that there was no security camera operating in the garage, James M. Fox, the assistant F.B.I. director in charge of the New York office, said there was a videotape camera mounted at one or more of the garage's three entrances.
He said it "just came into our possession" and appeared to offer tapes of cars entering and exiting the garage, which has public and commercial entrances on West and Liberty Streets. "It's being reviewed and copied," he said. "We'll know soon."
He did not explain why the existence of a tape that could prove vital only emerged yesterday. Given the selectivity with which details of the case have been parceled out or withheld, it was possible that the existence of a tape had been kept secret for some investigative purpose.
Among the things a videotape could show, he said, was a vehicle whose springs might be sagging under an immense weight that could have been the bomb. Both Mr. Fox and Mr. Kelly have said they do not know what kind of vehicle, if any, carried the bomb or what the bomb consisted of. An estimated 500 to 1,500 pounds of dynamite were used, investigators have said.
Investigators believe dynamite was the likely explosive because of the discovery of nitrates, but some close to the case have heard it described as a possible mixture of fuel oil and fertilizer. No evidence has been found to confirm use of a more compact and moldable plastic explosive called Composition 4 or Semtex, favored by international terrorists.
 
A Note of Caution
 But other investigators in the teams of F.B.I., police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms yesterday cautioned against ruling out any explosive until further tests of the site. "Finding nitrates at a place where an explosion took place is like finding soot at a fire scene," one said, adding that plastic explosives also produce nitrates.
Impeding the investigation, Commissioner Kelly said, was the "secondary collapse" of a garage wall, requiring a further delay of two to three days before the site could be shored up for entry by experts. Some evidence was collected by a robot yesterday, an investigator said.
But other tips have multiplied, Mr. Fox said. "We have some information from individuals outside reporting the activity of vehicles that we found quite interesting," he said. He declined to be more specific.
He said that of about 50 callers who gave tips, a dozen came from people present at or around the garage Friday. "I'd say three or four of those were very interesting and leads that we're pursuing right now," he said.
Other leads, Mr. Kelly said, came from the practice of taking license-plate numbers of drivers who parked their cars on the public level of the garage, known as B-2, where the blast likely originated.
While some law-enforcement officials have said that the use of dynamite in the bomb -- as opposed to harder-to-get plastic explosives -- was a sign of unsophistication, several current and former Government officials today took issue with that assessement.
 
'Does Not Excuse Terrorists'
 L. Paul Bremer, who headed the State Department's counterterrorism operations in the 1980's, noted instead that many terrorist groups have frequently used dynamite in car bombs. "The fact that it's dynamite does not excuse terrorists," Mr. Bremer said.
Mr. Bremer and other experts said the lack of a credible claim of responsibility before the blast remained the biggest mystery in the case. "For a terrorist, there's not much use in doing this unless you make it known that you did it," Mr. Bremer said.
But Mr. Fox added that it was possible that the bomb misfired, exploding before the group had a chance to make a phone call claiming responsibility. Asked if the bomb might have been planted overnight, he said: "We already have some pretty good raw information and intelligence that we're analyzing and working on right now that would lead us to the conclusion that you're suggesting." But he said: "At this time I have no idea whether it was brought in an hour before or a week before."
Others who spoke to investigators on the case said yesterday that they appeared to be on to something, although no one would say what it was. Mr. Fox acknowledged yesterday that his mood picked up markedly between Friday and Saturday night.
The focus on Serbians, who might be angry over United States policies in the former Yugoslavia, reflects the investigators' strong suspicion that the bomb may have been the work of political terrorists even if they have yet to find clear-cut evidence pointing to any particular group.
 
Organized Into Teams
 Investigators have ruled out few possibilities, though they seemed to be discarding the possibility that a disgruntled or deranged person detonated the bomb. One group of investigators has organized themselves into teams, each assigned to examine whether the bomb could have been set by a different terrorist organization, most likely Middle Eastern and European extremist groups.
Agents in several states have questioned registered owners of vehicles parked at the Trade Center lot. Those interviews, along with the questioning of building employees and telephone calls made to a tip line are helping to create a composite profile of activity in the parking area before the blast.
In Albany, Mr. Cuomo, who has an office on the 57th floor of 2 World Trade Center, said: "I think this has been good for New York. I think the demonstration of strength, the demonstration of cohesion, the demonstration of intelligence by New Yorkers and their public employees showed the way the city should work."
"I will lead my people back into that office" in the Trade Center, the Governor said, adding that he hoped it would not take more than a week.

HEADLINE: The Price of Worker Health Care

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Managed health-care programs, including some that use the ideas under study by Hillary Rodham Clinton's White House commission on health policy, helped to moderate medical inflation last year, according to a national survey of employers released yesterday. But health expenditures per employee still rose by 10.1 percent, or more than three times as fast as overall living costs.
Several employee-benefits executives said in interviews that national legislation was still needed to shield corporate profits from high health-care costs for employees. 
 The cost of health benefits, on average, is 50 percent of corporate net earnings, according to the survey by the Foster Higgins benefits consulting firm. The survey included responses from 2,448 large and medium-size employers. Questionnaires were sent to the 500 largest American companies and also distributed to members of employer health-care coalitions across the country.
Health-benefit costs in 1992 averaged $3,968 an employee, an increase of 10.1 percent from a year earlier, the Higgins survey said. Costs rose 14.2 percent for traditional fee-for-service health plans, 8.8 percent for health maintenance organizations and 10.5 percent for other "preferred provider" plans that offer incentives for patients to use designated doctors and hospitals.
Costs were highest in the Middle Atlantic States and New England and lowest in the Rocky Mountain States and the Southeast.
The New York metropolitan area had the highest costs, averaging $4,852 an employee for traditional coverage, followed by Philadelphia, $4,696; San Francisco, $4,531; Los Angeles, $4,350, and Chicago, $4,245.
About half of the employees surveyed were in some type of managed-care plan, including 26 percent in H.M.O.'s. Thirty percent of the companies no longer offer traditional fee-for-service coverage, compared with 24 percent in 1991.
Mrs. Clinton's commission is reportedly considering proposals for a version of managed competition in a national health-care plan. President Clinton has endorsed the concept in general terms.
Although the Administration has not yet defined it, advocates of managed competition say health-care users should be combined in large purchasing groups. The advocates say the groups could force H.M.O.'s and other hospital and doctor organizations to compete by cutting prices and improving services. Other proposals include reducing tax breaks for health coverage for employers and employees, and placing limits on health spending, nationally or by states.
"Managed care is part of the solution, but it is not the whole solution," said John Erb, a principal in New York with Foster Higgins. He noted that enrollment in health maintenance organizations was still relatively small, even though public policy makers have been promoting these prepaid health plans for 20 years.
 
'Still Too Much'
 Sharon Canner, a health-care policy specialist at the National Association of Manufacturers, said that "unless there is some force to make managed competition happen, the change for the better is just going to take much too long, while corporate profits erode."
"Three times inflation is still too much," she added.
Dr. Mary Jane England, president of the Washington Business Group on Health, an association of large employers, said, "It is clear from the survey that managed care makes a difference." But she added that costs were often shifted from one type of health plan to another, because people who have serious illnesses often insisted on keeping physicians outside a company's health maintenance organization or other managed-care plan.
She said that there should be "managed competition in the entire health-care system," but that it should include a provision that would let employees go outside the system if they were willing to pay more for the privilege.
About 5 percent of the employees in the survey were enrolled in such flexible programs, which are called "point of service" plans. They included 36,000 telephone workers at the Bell Atlantic Corporation, the regional telephone company.
Tenneco Inc., the Houston-based diversified energy and manufacturing company, recently started a similar program for 25,000 salaried employees, whose medical costs had been increasing by 16 percent annually, said Kim Bacon, Tenneco's benefits director.
At Bell Atlantic, Gary Simko, strategic planning manager for employee benefits, said medical costs rose about 10 percent in the point-of-service plan last year, by preliminary estimates. The increase was about half what the company had expected.
 
Questioning the Findings
 But Rhoda Karpatkin, president of Consumers Union, an advocacy group that favors a government-regulated health-care system like Canada's, said the managed-care record had still not justified a national move to managed competition.
A single year of slower growth in health costs "isn't a sufficient basis for policy making," she said.
"Nineteen ninety-two was a highly unusual year," Ms. Karpatkin continued. "There was a tremendous amount of self-consciousness about charges on the part of hospitals and doctors. It is possible they moderated their increases because of adverse publicity."

HEADLINE: Insurers Help Bear Blast Costs

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Insurance companies will pick up at least some of the costs to businesses in the World Trade Center affected by last week's blast, though many companies will find that it will take months before the damages are assessed and they can collect.
Although it is far too early to assess the total cost of the disaster to insurers, some insurance experts predicted that their losses could easily exceed the $300 million in business and property damage caused by a large flood last year in downtown Chicago. But losses are not expected to approach the $17 billion figure associated with Hurricane Hugo. 
 "Right now, people can only grasp at numbers," said Hugh Strawn, director of catastrophic services for the Property Loss Research Bureau, a trade association in Schaumburg, Ill.
 
 
Small Business Loans
 Small, uninsured businesses in the New York City area affected by the blast received good news yesterday when the Small Business Administration approved a request by Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York for economic injury disaster loans. Hundreds of businesses -- from small newsstands to elegant restaurants -- are expected to qualify. The agency will review claims based on a formula that will compare businesses' losses to their size.
For tenants at the World Trade Center, losses may involve damage to offices or computer equipment, which are typically covered by property coverage. But far greater losses will be caused by interruptions to a company's business and costs related to temporary relocations.
Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York City, said many companies were insured against losses caused by interruptions to their businesses. In some cases, they may also be covered for costs related to temporary relocations, like computer rentals.
Mr. Strawn said that business interruption insurance typically covered a percentage of lost profits -- which can vary depending on the insurance policy -- caused by dislocations. Companies with well-developed contingency plans usually receive discounts on the premiums.
 
Claims Will Take Time
 Insurance experts said most large commercial policies would cover losses caused by a bomb, even if it was planted by terrorists.
But it may take some time before claims are paid. Jack Daly, a spokesman for the ITT Hartford Insurance Group in Hartford, said adjusters could still not get into policyholders' offices to inspect for damage. Once that happens, it will probably take two to three weeks to pay off on smoke damage claims.
Payments on business interruption claims could take considerably longer, because it is up to the policyholder to support claims of lost revenues with documentation, Mr. Daly said.
"They have to produce their books and records," he said. "It is a lot of hard work for the policyholder."
Under the plan announced yesterday by the Small Business Adminstration, small businesses in the New York City area that have been economically damaged by the blast or its aftermath may qualify for low-interest loans of up to $500,000 to cover business expense, said Jill Finnie, an S.B.A. spokeswoman. Businesses need not be situated in the World Trade Center complex to qualify for the government loans. The loans are intended to cover operating expenses that are not currently being met because of losses stemming from the disaster, Ms. Finnie said.
The loans carry an interest rate of 4 percent, and can be paid under terms that can be extended up to 30 years. There is no cap on the number of loans available, but they are available only to the uninsured or those who cannot get conventional loans, Ms. Finnie said.
 
 
Port Authority's Position
 Businesses whose claims exceed their coverage levels, or who do not receive disaster assistance, may look to the Port Authority to help cover losses. Barry Weintraub, chief financial official for the authority, said it had not yet received claims from tenants, but did not rule them out.
"If companies move against the Port Authority, it will be adjudicated in some way," he said. "We will discuss it, and if we are deemed to be liable we will cover it."
Mr. Weintraub said that the Port Authority had about $600 million in coverage to pay for property damage and interruptions to its own business. He said the complex was insured by a consortium of domestic companies.
He said there was no estimate as yet of damage to the structure, but added that the Port Authority's business-interruption losses were likely to exceed $5 million for each week the complex is closed.
It is also possible that insurers may eventually turn to the Port Authority to reimburse them for claims they have paid to their policyholders. Such lawsuits typically require a showing of neglience to succeed, Mr. Strawn said.
The Port Authority has acknowledged that it did not take all of the security measures against terrorism recommended by consultants in 1985.

HEADLINE: Optimism Is Being Tempered a Bit

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
A burst of post-election optimism about the economy, reflected in rising stock prices and a sharp upward turn in consumer confidence, has lately given way to a string of so-so economic reports, a spurt of fresh anxiety and new questions about the staying power of the economic expansion.
Even the Commerce Department's announcement last week that the economy had grown a sensational 4.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1992 -- a full percentage point above its previous estimate -- did little to assuage doubts, since almost no one believes that that pace will hold.
 
No Forecasts of Recession
 Despite worrisome signs of weakness, few experts see recession on the horizon. In fact, most economists and business executives are counting on solid growth of about 3 percent or so this year, far slower than in the fall but a full percentage point higher than in 1992. 
 That viewpoint was supported by a fresh crop of economic reports yesterday -- on manufacturing, consumers and construction -- indicating that growth has fallen off the rapid pace of late last year. [Page D2.]
The latest figures follow another round of layoffs by large companies and visions of higher taxes, both of which have undercut consumer confidence. Bearish investors have been snapping up bonds instead of stocks, as market analysts lower their forecasts for corporate earnings. And President Clinton's critics on the left and right cite economic fragility in trying to alter his proposals.
There is no question that the outlook holds significant risks. Businesses' reluctance to hire is holding down incomes. Painful corporate overhauls will continue for years. Exports, which have been growing briskly, appear likely to weaken as recessions drag on in Japan and Europe. Construction is hobbled by empty office buildings and half-rented shopping malls. And the shrinking military budget is taking a toll from California to Connecticut.
But the $6 trillion American economy is a lot like a supertanker -- once it starts sailing, it takes more than a few misfires to shut the engines.
"Most of the indicators people look at suggest that the economy is showing signs of sustainable recovery," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
Much of the extreme queasiness in the financial markets is probably a simple case of nerves. Investors, after all, are known for alternating bouts of nail biting and euphoria.
This time fears of a slowdown could help avert a slump, by keeping a lid on inflation expectations, and, thus, on interest rates. "The bond market's reaction to the President's proposals has been much more supportive of the economy than we expected," said Roger Brinner, chief economist at DRI/McGraw Hill. "It's great news for housing, investment and international competitiveness because it has halted the appreciation of the dollar."
Long-term interest rates and inflation are now the lowest they have been in two decades. Productivity has spurted. Crucial sources of middle-class discomfort -- falling house prices, shrinking net worth and heavy debts -- have receded as problems. And the rebounds in consumer spending, housing and business investment appear to be continuing.
As for the concerns about the depressing effects of the higher taxes and spending cuts the President is calling for, the pain is not scheduled to start for more than a year. In fact, the program is intended to be slightly stimulative at first, swelling the deficit somewhat this year.
"We want insurance against the recovery's stalling out," Ms. Tyson said, referring to the plan to spend quickly an extra $31 billion.
Also, some economists point out, the mix of tax increases and new spending might not hurt overall consumer spending.
"People ignore the fact that higher taxes on the affluent are more likely to come out of saving than consumption," said Paul McCulley, chief economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland. "And more Government outlays tend to put money in the hands of people who spend all of their incomes and more."
The bigger worry, a number of executives say, is the Administration's evident enthusiasm for ambitious social legislation, from raising the minimum wage to mandating business training programs.
"There is a whole package of things lurking in the background that are making people -- especially medium-sized companies -- concerned about the cost of permanent employment," said Mitchell S. Fromstein, president of Manpower Inc.
What follows is a look, sector by sector, at the latest data on the economy's momentum:
HOUSING (STRONG): Mortgage rates are almost one percentage point lower than before the election, and buyer traffic suggests that home buying, which dipped during an unusually cold January, will resume with vigor. Housing was already reviving strongly last fall and so was single-family-home construction, which continued to grow in January. Existing-home sales, which slid during January's cold, were nonetheless 15 percent higher than a year earlier.
CONSUMERS (SLOWING DOWN): Consumers have been spending faster than pay has been rising, and their faith in the economic expansion remains wobbly. Sentiment surveys have shown a dip in confidence in recent days. So while consumers are expected to remain moderate in their buying -- as the January data suggested -- merchants and retail consultants say they see no real retreat.
In autos, the sales pace is significantly faster than last year's. Johnson Redbook's weekly surveys of store sales found February's figures to be higher than January's. Wage income is growing modestly and saving is up. "We'll settle into sustained but very moderate growth in consumer spending," said Randall Gebhardt, a consultant at Fitch Inc., a marketing company in Columbus, Ohio.
BUSINESS INVESTMENT (STRONG): Business's drive to improve efficiency -- as well as the availability of high-technology products at irresistibly low prices -- has produced an unparalleled surge in equipment spending. Spending has climbed nearly 17 percent in the last year after adjusting for inflation. Orders for capital equipment are near a record high and, thanks to resurgent profits, the pool of money to pay for all this has never been bigger.
INVENTORIES (RESTOCKING AGAIN): Inventories remain extremely lean, and executives say they need to restock a bit just to keep up with sales. Factories are busier, and industrial production has been rising briskly. According to a survey of executives by the Cahners Publishing Company in Newton, Mass., four out of five businesses foresee higher sales in the next three months and more than two-thirds plan to raise production.
EXPORTS AND IMPORTS (RISKY): Exports have been booming and were one factor in last fall's ebullient growth. American products are highly competitive and growing third world economies have been scooping them up. But the economic slowdowns in Germany and Japan, along with the stronger dollar, pose a big risk. Growth in Germany and Japan is not likely to resume until next year, and growth in the third world has turned less vigorous. At the same time, rising spending here will bring in more imports.
JOBS (GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT): The labor market is -- almost imperceptibly -- on the mend. Workers are working more hours. Payroll job growth has been running at 90,000 a month for the last three months. State data suggest that payrolls may be expanding a bit faster. Unemployment is down to 7.1 percent from 7.7 percent. More important, despite the layoff announcements by some well-known companies, jobless claims have declined steadily from the mid-400,000's to the low 300,000's.
"Nobody says things are just booming," Mr. Fromstein of Manpower said. "On the other hand, there's steady growth, and it will come through in terms of plans to hire for the second quarter."

In Destitute Land, Doctor Builds Dream Hospital

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, March 1

 BODY:
Dr. Beat Richner is a 45-year-old Swiss pediatrician. He is also a cellist, a writer and teller of tales and illustrator. Combining these talents with an enduring commitment to Cambodia's children, he has created something precious in this battered and deprived country -- a modern, well-equipped, spotlessly clean and fully staffed hospital.
In the consensus of Cambodian doctors and international aid workers, the Kantha Bopha Hospital is the best in Cambodia. Less than a year ago it was a derelict complex, not used since the Communist victory in 1975, mounds of rubble around a hollow shell. 
 Dr. Richner left the hospital when the Khmer Rouge took the city. But back in Zurich he could not rid himself of a sense of guilt for having deserted his patients, their families and his colleagues to the terror of the Pol Pot regime. "I had a bad conscience for having left here," he said.
Although he made a successful career as a pediatrician and concert artist, Dr. Richner said in his heart Cambodia remained a painful, open wound. "I had not finished this," he said.
 
Confronting a Catastrophe>
 He came back in December 1991, soon after the Paris agreement for a peaceful settlement of the conflict reopened this reclusive country to outsiders, and was asked by the Health Ministry to restore the hospital, which the United States had built.
"I had no idea of doing something here," he said. "I just wanted to see it."
But Dr. Richner was shocked by the hospitals. "No water, no electricity, no drugs -- a catastrophe," he said.
Compared with the hospitals elsewhere in this nation of perhaps eight million people, those of the capital are luxurious. Recalling a visit to the only hospital in Kompong Thom Province north of here, Dr. Pung Chhiv Kek Gallabru, a Cambodian physician who returned from France to organize a human rights group, said, "You could put all the equipment of the operating room into one small box."
Most Cambodian medical services, nonexistent in the years when the Khmer Rouge ruled the country, were provided by Vietnamese, Soviet and Eastern European doctors after the Vietnamese invasion that toppled the Khmer Rouge in 1979. The Vietnamese, impoverished themselves, withdrew first, and the collapse of the Western Communist governments left Cambodia largely to its own devices.
Physicians, all civil servants in a country that retains many aspects of Communism, receive monthly salaries of less than $20, despite high inflation. As a result, said Dr. Yit Sunnara, chief pediatrician at Kantha Bopha, doctors spend only a few hours at their jobs and earn their living in illicit private practices or in nonmedical trades.
Drugs are virtually nonexistent in purely Cambodian hospitals, where they are supposed to be free of charge. In the few hospitals supported by foreign medical teams, large quantities are stolen by the staff to supplement their salaries.
Dr. Richner decided that his duty was to restore Kantha Bopha. Without any assurance of financing, he signed a contract to do so. "It was a little bit naive," he said, but added that he had been encouraged by friends in the Swiss Government and large companies to believe they would finance the work. They declined.
Dr. Richner vented his disappointment to a mass-circulation magazine that had come to interview him on his 20th anniversary as a well-known performer under his stage name of Beatocello. While playing his cello, he tells or sings the tales that he writes, some funny, some sad, some both. Behind him as he performs are his own illustrations, flashed onto a screen.
 
An Outpouring of Help
 The interview brought an outpouring of contributions. Switzerland's largest circus staged a gala as a benefit, starring Dr. Richner. He played benefits throughout his country. An anonymous contribution of $333,000 arrived at the bank.
"Three days ago, an anonymous woman from Basel sent 400,000 francs," Dr Richner said -- about $265,000. "Now I can pay for this construction," he said, pointing to a surgery wing and a maternity building being restored.
About $4.6 million has been contributed so far, he said.
The hospital is equipped with modern medical technology not found elsewhere in Cambodia. There are 105 beds, and about 300 outpatients are treated daily. No patient has yet paid for any service, Dr. Richner said.
He has also used the contributions to pay his staff of 140 -- 23 doctors, 75 nurses, medical technicians and maintenance workers -- substantial supplements to their Government pay.
"The motivations for working here are electricity, water and medicines, and economic benefits." Dr. Yit said. "We need to live."
 
Specialists From Switzerland
 Five nurses, two technicians and an inventive Swiss who has installed water supply, drainage and electricity are on the staff. "The foreigners here must also educate the Cambodian staff, otherwise they would only be stealing jobs," Dr. Richner said.
Swiss specialists come on regular rotations to treat and to teach. Dr. Richner also teaches at the only medical school in the country. Physicians from throughout the country come to attend pediatrics workshops.
Relaxing on a porch overlooking the surgery and maternity buildings after his morning round of the wards and daily meeting with his doctors, the pediatrician laughed quietly.
"Everybody told me it was too difficult," he said. "So I stopped thinking and started to dream. And now it's reality."

With Dr. Yit Sunnar, chief pediatrician, he examined an infant brought to the crowded reception room. (David Portnoy for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Several Sets of Data Suggest Slower Growth

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
A fresh crop of economic reports yesterday -- on manufacturing, consumers and construction -- suggests that the economy's growth is slowing from the snappy 4.8 percent annual rate of last quarter.
Investors reacted by buying bonds and selling stocks, a typical reaction to signs of a slowing economy. 
 Economic weakness could make it easier for President Clinton to sell his program for additional deficit spending this year to insure against another downturn. As for forecasters, they had already been looking for economic growth to ease from the recent torrid pace as businesses finished replenishing inventories and consumers settled down after their holiday buying.
"Economic growth should stay healthy despite some moderation in consumer spending," said Mickey Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities Ltd.
David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, concurred. "There's nothing in today's data to contradict a 3 or 4 percent first-quarter" growth rate, he said.
The consensus among economists, based on the data available so far this quarter, is that growth is running at about a 3 percent annual rate.
Following are the economic reports released yesterday:
 
 
Purchasers' Report
 The nation's factories, after a fast-paced January, expanded activity at a slower rate in February as the rise in new orders slackened. That could be inferred from the index of purchasing managers, which is based on a monthly poll of corporate purchasing executives. The February index slipped to 55.8 from 58.0 in January.
"That's still strong," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the National Association of Purchasing Managers' business committee and an executive at Pitney Bowes in Stamford, Conn. The rise in the index in January "was to the highest level since 1988, probably not a level that could be sustained," he said.
Any index number over 50, he noted, is a sign that manufacturing is expanding; any number over 44.5 indicates that the economy as a whole is growing. Forecasters watch the poll because, while unofficial, it is the first measure of real economic activity in the previous month, preceding the Government's monthly employment data by at least several days.
The survey showed an increase in industries that were expanding -- 16 in January versus 13 in February.
 
Consumer Spending
 Consumers pulled back in January, the Commerce Department said. Their spending rose three-tenths of 1 percent that month, compared with eight-tenths in December. Adjusting for inflation, consumption actually dipped one-tenth of 1 percent, the first decline in several months.
"That's not a beginning of a trend," Mr. Levy said. He expects spending to ease in real terms from last quarter's fevered pace of 5 percent, but only to 3 percent or so.
Consumers have grown less confident in the economy. Since the President presented his economic plan in mid-February, the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment has dropped 6 points. But most economists are not alarmed.
"Confidence, while off its peak," Mr. Levy added, "is still solid; employment and incomes are rising, and mortgage refinancing is freeing up more disposable income."
The Commerce Department also said personal income grew five-tenths of 1 percent in January after jumping a full percentage point in December. Wages and salaries climbed six-tenths of 1 percent, twice the pace of inflation.
 
Construction
 Construction spending fell 1.3 percent in January, compared with December, falling to an annual rate of $430.8 billion. Spending on public construction fell 4.9 percent to $114 billion, the Commerce Department said. Private construction flattened out at $316.8 billion. With commercial vacancy rates still high, though improving, business building fell again. But single-family-home construction rose to $131.4 billion from $129.6 billion in December.
 
Home Sales
 Sales of existing homes fell a sharp 6.4 percent in January, the National Association of Realtors reported, but few economists took that to mean the housing recovery was in trouble. Sales are still 15 percent higher than a year earlier and unusually frigid weather may have kept prospective buyers at home.

U.S. Plans No Big Borrowing Shift

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said yesterday that he was not planning any drastic shift to short-term Government borrowing.
Although he did not provide any precise details of the Government's future borrowing plans, Mr. Bentsen's comments might prove disappointing to some traders and investors. Some of the recent surge in the price of the 30-year bond has been based, traders said, on expectations that the Treasury would further reduce the size of the regular quarterly 30-year auctions, shifting Government borrowing to shorter-term issues. 
 In last month's quarterly auction, the Treasury cut the 30-year bond sale by $1 billion, to $9.25 billion. A year earlier, the Treasury had lopped $2 billion off the size of the regular auction.
"I think we can do some shift," Mr. Bentsen told reporters in Washington. But he added, "I do not propose any dramatic, radical shift."
There has been some speculation in the Treasury market that the Treasury might not even sell any 30-year bonds in the next quarterly auction in May. This speculation is based in part on the fact that President Clinton's deficit-reduction proposal includes savings of $11.5 billion over three years from savings from debt management. When asked about achieving these savings, Mr. Bentsen said that if that amount was not achieved, the Administration would adjust the projections in the budget.
 
Trade Center Ripples
 Mr. Bentsen's comments came at end of a trading day that was still recovering from the effects of Friday's explosion at the World Trade Center. Although the explosion sent ripples through the bond market, it was not seriously disruptive.
The prices of Treasury bonds and notes rallied in what some traders estimated was a slightly more active Monday than usual. The rally brought the yield on the 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, down to 6.84 percent, from 6.90 percent on Friday, and just above the 16-year low of 6.82 percent reached a week ago Tuesday.
The absence of one of the market's major dealers -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- left some investors with less information to trade on. Cantor is a matchmaker for investors who want to buy and sell fixed income securities and is also a leading source of active bond price information for the market. But the explosion at the World Trade Center closed Cantor's offices.
Some portfolio managers said that the liquidity or ease of trading the market was reduced somewhat. A few portfolio managers were left a little in the dark because they did not have the price and interest-rate data from Cantor Fitzgerald. And some who trade through Cantor had to go to primary dealers to make trades.
"There is a little bit of caution on the part of some retail accounts because Cantor is their main source of information," said Matthew Alexy, a government-trading strategist at the First Boston Corporation.
But other managers said that unless there was a need to make a lot of trades during the day, there was no problem. "With our perspective of a longer term we do not have to know the price from second to second," said Curt Hollingsworth, a portfolio manager for Fidelity Investments in Boston. He also said that alternative sources, like Bloomberg and Govpx, gave him a satisfactory picture of market activity.
Officials at Cantor, which has moved its operations from One World Trade Center to several temporary locations, said yesterday that part of their fixed-income operations would be restored by today and the rest would be back on line tomorrow.
Joel Kazis, managing director at UBS Securities, said, "'most of us are used to looking at Cantor but the market doesn't stop when they are out of business." He is a primary dealer in the Treasury market and can get the prices from the other four major brokers in the business.
 
Data From Govpx
 The absence of Cantor gave Govpx, a rival that also distributes bond market prices to investors and traders, the chance to be seen by many potential clients who might not have been interested in the past. The firm, which was begun in June 1991 by the four rival brokers of Cantor Fitzgerald, authorized its distributors, which include Bloomberg, Knight-Ridder and Reuters, to send the Govpx data to 85,000 terminals in trading rooms around the country. Govpx has paying customers with 3,000 terminals now.
"It was an opportunity for people to try Govpx in the time of need," said Laurence Jones, the president of Govpx.
 
Port Authority
 In the wake of the World Trade Center explosion, the price of Port Authority bonds was off slightly in light trading. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey owns the World Trade Center.
But municipal bond traders said there was no rush to sell the bonds. In addition, Barry Weintrob, the chief financial officer, said the Port Authority intended to go ahead with its scheduled sale of $100 million in bonds tomorrow.
"No one is looking to dump their bonds," said Monica Wieboldt, a portfolio manager for municipal bonds at the Dreyfus Corporation. She said she saw an offer to sell about $2 million of the Port Authority 6 percent bonds due in 2028 in the morning. But she and other traders said that was not much activity given the circumstances. Late in the day, the bond was off about 1/2 a point.
 
Treasury Market
 While Treasury prices rose across the board, the yields were still a little above the low levels of last Tuesday. For example, the 10-year note rose 15/32 to yield 5.94 percent, down from 6.01 Friday but up from 5.89 percent last Tuesday.
In the weekly auction of Treasury bills, the average discount rate rose to 2.97 percent on three-month bills and fell to 3.05 percent on six month bills. Following are the results from the auction:

HEADLINE: Restoring an Ancient Landscape: An Innovative Plan for the Midwest

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
INTERIOR SECRETARY BRUCE BABBITT'S announcement two weeks ago that he would try to prevent endangered-species crises by promoting the long-term health care of whole ecosystems may signal a new era in Federal conservation policy. But the concept is already built into a number of ambitious ecosystem protection efforts that have lately been undertaken across the country.
Almost as Mr. Babbitt spoke, in fact, scientists, conservationists and government officials from throughout the Midwest gathered in Chicago for a long-planned three-day meeting to develop a recovery plan for one of the nation's largest and most threatened ecosystems: a vast expanse of oak-studded savanna that once intertwined with the open prairies in a diverse mosaic of biological wealth reaching from the Great Lakes to Texas. 
 Before Europeans arrived in America, the oak savannas carpeted some 30 million acres of the Midwest, including half the landscape in places like southern Wisconsin and northeastern Illinois. In many places, the savannas had the aspect of a tidy, open picnic grove; in others they were brushier, with hazel bushes much in evidence. Naturally occurring fires killed most trees, but enough tough young oaks survived over the years to provide the ecosystem with its keystone plant species.
An unusually rich array of wildflowers and grasses, suited to partial sunlight and able to pop back up quickly after a fire, formed a thick green carpet under oak canopies. Butterflies that are rare today flocked to the plants. Both bison and deer, depending on location, grazed and browsed in the savanna-prairie mosaic.
The fires ceased with farming and development, and invading trees and alien plant species like European buckthorn filled in and choked savannas not plowed or covered by subdivisions. Now less than 1 percent of high-quality oak savanna remains, in fragments that biologists say are too small and scattered for many of the species that live there to survive in the long run. But hundreds of thousands more acres exist in degraded and biologically impoverished form, their ecological character destroyed and most of the many species that once lived there long gone.
Scattered restoration experiments have shown that these choked and degraded tracts can be revived and that much of their biological diversity will then return, scientists say. The Chicago group worked out a preliminary plan for restoring sufficient acreage to assure the ecosystem's long-term health, and is now turning to the task of working with public and private landowners to put it into effect.
"We cannot preserve species unless we preserve the entire system which supports those species," Dr. Alan Haney, the dean of forestry at the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point, an organizer of the savanna conference, told the participants.
This is the heart of the approach being advocated by Mr. Babbitt and pursued on a number of fronts, and Dr. Haney said the approach marks "a radical change in the way we look at our natural resources."
The object of the approach is to practice preventive medicine on ecosystems and their entire array of species rather than wait until it is necessary to prescribe painful emergency treatment on a crash basis when a single species becomes endangered. By that time, according to the theory, an ecosystem has become so degraded that options for protecting species are narrow and there is little leeway for compromise between economic and conservation interests.
By intervening earlier on an ecosystem-wide basis, say proponents of the approach, it is easier to make acceptable tradeoffs between the ecology and the economy while avoiding confrontational politics and lawsuits.
In this way, Mr. Babbitt said, it might be possible to avert "national train wrecks" like the one that occurred when logging interests and conservationists collided in the spotted owl controversy in the Pacific Northwest. The ecosystem approach, said the Secretary, is "clearly an idea whose time has come."
But can the approach work in practice?
 
Program in California
 The results for both species preservation and economic health may not be seen for some time. Two initiatives similar in concept to the savanna plan, however, are encouraging conservationists to believe that diverse interests can at least band together in the cause of ecosystem preservation and recovery.
In California, state, local and Federal agencies are joining with landowners to preserve the coastal sage scrub ecosystem that stretches from Los Angeles to San Diego. This is a formerly extensive but now shrinking assembly of shrubby, chaparral-like flora and associated fauna. Many of its species, among them a bird called the California gnatcatcher, are approaching but have not yet reached federally endangered status.
Some 70 private landowners and many local governments have formally enrolled 200,000 acres of land in the project; the ecosystem consists of 250,000 to 350,000 acres. The state hopes to put the plan, which will be legally binding, into effect later this year.
The project is the first concrete step undertaken under a new statewide conservation policy that divides California into 10 contiguous bioregions. Each has its own ecological character and its own council of state, local and Federal representatives to coordinate long-term planning for both conservation and economic development. An explicit purpose of this arrangement is to promote preventive, ecosystem-wide conservation of multiple species.
 
Efforts in Texas
 A similar effort in Texas seeks to accommodate both the ecology and economy of the biologically rich hill-country region. In the Austin area, the Nature Conservancy has brokered a plan by various governmental and private interests to acquire and assemble ecologically rich tracts of the regional ecosystem into a 60,000-acre preserve around which development can proceed.
In some cases, developers are giving up land in exchange for the right to build elsewhere in the county. The arrangement is part of a larger hill-country strategy in which several large "core" preserves are being set aside and surrounded by buffer zones of ecologically friendly activity, including ecotourism ranches. The Nature Conservancy is also pursuing this general strategy in more than 40 other places in the United States.
Mr. Babbitt, who describes the group's conservationists as "surely the leaders" in trying to balance biodiversity concerns with economics through the ecosystem approach, has conferred on the matter with John C. Sawhill, the conservancy's president.
The Secretary said he did not yet have a "good fix" on the fledgling Midwestern savanna plan, which in any case is being co-sponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency. But he said he had been briefed in detail on the California project and considers it "an important, important demonstration of how these concepts might work."
Douglas P. Wheeler, California's Resources Secretary, suggested that while Interior officials were "taking a hard look" at his state's program, the Endangered Species Act needed to be modified to accommodate the ecosystem approach.
"The whole notion of ecosystem planning is far more advanced today than when the law was enacted in 1973," said Mr. Wheeler.
The Endangered Species Act requires that a conservation plan be put in place for a single species already listed as endangered. But it does not require preventive programs for entire ecosystems with all their species. The law is up for re-authorization this year, and Mr. Babbitt, whose department enforces the act, said he thought it should be re-examined, possibly by an independent private commission.
In the meantime, other public and private organizations are pressing their own ecosystem recovery plans. The Chicago savanna conference in late February is a major example. The conference was sponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency, the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point, the Nature Conservancy and Northeastern Illinois University and was attended by experts from many other agencies and groups.
Scientists argue about how the savanna should be defined. A broad rule of thumb is that the tree canopy covers 10 to 80 percent of the ground in a savanna, while the prairie is essentially treeless and the forest canopy is essentially closed. Some experts assign the term woodland to denser concentrations of savanna oaks short of closed forest.
But whatever classifications people impose, there is no sharp demarcation; plant and animal species find their favored habitats along a prairie-to-forest continuum, with many making their primary home in the savanna by any definition. As they actually arrange themselves on the land, savanna, prairie, wetlands and sometimes even forest are so intertwined that it is virtually impossible to separate them.
That complicates the conservation effort, as does the fact that changing climatic factors caused the savannas and prairies to shift their positions on the landscape. Both the mosaic aspect of the ecosystem and its dynamics, it was decided at the conference, require the conservation of large enough slices of the landscape to accommodate all the interrelated parts and the shifts they undergo; small, isolated remnants of savanna will not do the job.
The preliminary recovery plan, some features of which are still being refined as a result of the Chicago discussions, calls for identifying large acreages of overgrown savanna on public land that can be restored to something approaching their condition before European settlers arrived. These might serve as "core" reserves, said Steve Packard, the science director of the Illinois Nature Conservancy, another organizer of the conference.
In addition, he said, many private holdings like farms and timberlands contain degraded savanna that could be restored as buffer zones without interfering with economic uses of the land. All these tracts would be stitched into a network containing perhaps 5 to 10 percent of the original savanna. That is thought by some scientists to be sufficient for long-term maintenance of the ecosystem.
The organizers of the conference are just starting to develop a mechanism for putting the plan into effect. It might consist of a regional "recovery team" of scientists, agency representatives and conservationists negotiating land-use arrangements.
 
Strategy of Restoration
 Once the arrangements are in place, the basic restoration strategy is to start to reintroduce burning on a controlled basis. In some types of savanna, experiments have already shown, this is sufficient to allow the savanna to re-emerge.
In others, like the classic tall-grass, black-soil savanna of northeastern Illinois, it is necessary not only to burn out invaders but also to re-sow the savannas with seeds from the past. When this is done, as a Nature Conservancy restoration project directed by Mr. Packard in the Chicago area has shown, the savanna can rebound spectacularly.
But some savanna species have disappeared already. "We have no idea whether that number is a few dozen or a few hundred or even a few thousand," Dr. Haney said. As time passes, he said, continued development and invasion by exotic plants may cause more species to disappear, and it will become more difficult to restore the landscape.
"This is the last decade or two when you can do this," Mr. Packard said. "The communities are disintegrating."

The Impetus for Havoc in Apartheid's Demise

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
South Africa's President, F. W. de Klerk, is the target of "Apartheid's Last Stand," tonight's "Frontline" report on his country's tense present and dangerous future.
With the help of vivid news clips, the hourlong program recalls the hopes raised by what the narrator calls "a special relationship" between Mr. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela, the leader of the African National Congress. But critics make a case that for several years the white Government has been stalling negotiations and encouraging clashes between black groups to discredit Mr. Mandela and his movement. 
 Mr. de Klerk is portrayed as a realistic politician who has been compelled to negotiate by international sanctions that have severely hurt South Africa's economy. Whether he is an accomplice of white hard-liners, particularly in the powerful security establishment, or is just unable to control them, is left unsettled.
Mr. Mandela, who is treated with the reverence he has long enjoyed on American television, is pictured as being under pressure from more radical elements in his organization as well as from the Zulu Chief, Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, the leader of the conservative Inkatha Freedom Party.
The well-edited program, which includes interviews with Mr. de Klerk, Mr. Mandela and Mr. Buthelezi, begins and ends with affecting scenes of black South Africans learning to vote. Those are the only optimistic moments in this portrayal of a profoundly divided land.
 
Murder, Rape and DNA
PBS, tonight
(In the New York area, Channels 13 and 49 at 8)
Fans of "Nova" who get the feeling tonight that "Hard Copy" has invaded their public channel should not kick the television set. It's the producers of "Murder, Rape and DNA" who deserve the boot. Apparently trying to juice up their report on DNA typing, the latest thing in forensic medicine, they have resorted to the re-enactments common to true-crime shows.
If you can ignore those banal scenes, with their creepy lighting and dreadful music, you can learn how technicians go about comparing a gene found, say, in sperm at the scene of a rape with the genetic makeup of a suspect. The results cannot prove that you committed a crime, but they can prove you did not commit it.
One beneficiary, whose case leads off the hour, is a San Diego man who was suspected of raping his 8-year-old daughter. The girl said at first that a stranger had climbed through her window and carried her to his car. But social workers and sex-abuse therapists kept at her for months until she changed her story and said her father did it. Only analysis of a semen stain belatedly noticed on her nightshirt cleared him.
Other cases, too, are reviewed tonight, alas with other re-enactments. The narrator says DNA typing is being hailed as "the most important forensic breakthrough since fingerprinting," but the prospect of a national DNA data bank of the genetic makeups of people who have been convicted of sexual assaults and other violent crimes troubles civil libertarians. Unfortunately, that interesting issue is mentioned only in a postscript to a program devoted mainly to crime stories.
Whether the producers were driven to use re-enactments because the process of DNA typing, mostly a comparison of dots on a computer printout, does not make for visual excitement, or whether they were attracted to the subject in the first place by its appeal to audiences who go for tales of rape cannot be decided even by DNA testing. Either way, "Nova" stands indicted on suspicion of the worst.

Irresistible Events, Immovable Networks

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
When the International Olympic Committee holds negotiations in the third or fourth week of July to sell network TV rights to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, a timetable that was announced yesterday, Olympic cash requirements will clash with radically altered network fiscal realities.
And the outcome will probably be a bellwether for how tightwaddish the networks will be in their coming talks with major league baseball, the National Football League and National Basketball Association (unless one of the three beats the Olympics to the negotiating table). 
 The I.O.C., negotiating on behalf of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, wants more than the $401 million NBC paid for last year's Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, and the Atlanta committee has said it wants upward of $550 million. Inside the I.O.C., anything less than $500 million will be deemed a disaster.
The Atlanta committee needs cash, especially to build the recently approved Olympic stadium, and because its sponsorship money is not flooding in.
Sadly for Atlanta and the I.O.C., NBC and its partner, Cablevision, lost over $100 million on Barcelona and no network has ever paid above $401 million. Despite ABC's flirtation with Turner Broadcasting to make a joint bid for Atlanta, ABC is best known for its refusal to bid on certain money-losers.
CBS, known for breaking the network bank in 1988 with its inflated $1.06 billion bid for major league baseball, has been chastened and is unlikely to bid ravenously for Atlanta as if its prime-time schedule depended on it.
Billy Payne, president of the Atlanta committee, who makes a smiley-face figure seem dour, insists that the lure of the centennial Summer Olympics, shown live from the East Coast of the United States, provides all the added value any network could possibly desire to bid more than $500 million.
"We're having no trouble convincing people they're worth more than Barcelona," he said. "We have an idea of the value; they have an idea. We will get what we need and they will pay no more than they need to."
That may be a contradiction in terms, because if a network pays no more than it needs to, Payne will not get what he wants. Not in this market, where baseball TV rights are expected to be cut in half, and pro football's hierarchy struggles internally over whether to grant networks financial relief or gamble on an improving economy.
Yes, perhaps, a live East Coast Olympics is alluring. But it is not worth $100 million to $150 million. Maybe half of that.
The I.O.C. hinted yesterday that it would do what is necessary to enhance the value of Atlanta TV rights. Richard W. Pound, chairman of the I.O.C.'s TV committee, told The Associated Press that the organization is "certainly ready to consider new approaches which could lead to more television coverage of more Olympic events for wider American audiences."
 
N.H.L. Goes Network
 Two of the first hires by Gary Bettman, the National Hockey League's new commissioner, are from TV: Steve Solomon of ABC Sports, as senior vice president, and Glenn Adamo, a former NBC producer, as vice president of broadcasting.
What a brainstorm! TV pros for the once TV-deprived league!
Solomon and Adamo started yesterday, with the decided advantage of having the ESPN cable deal in place since October, rather than the previous cablecaster, SportsChannel America, which reached a third of ESPN's 60 million subscribers and whose quality was about half of ESPN's.
"We want to take a look from top to bottom at how the game of hockey is telecast," said Solomon. "We're analyzing the game on television to improve the sport at home and bring the excitement that is clearly in the arenas."
Solomon is the sedate executive, a 21-year ABC veteran. Adamo is a hyperkinetic former producer, who played hockey at the University of Connecticut.
"It's time to be innovative and showcase the sport better," he said. "The game has to be more user-friendly on TV, where the casual fan can be entertained and find out things he didn't know before."
Adamo will examine ESPN and local telecasts as a prelude to creating league-wide uniformity in the televised look of the games, from camera angles and lighting to graphics and player features.
The overriding goal: get as close to the action as possible to turn those helmeted players into heroes. (He's read the N.B.A. TV manual.) ESPN is doing much of what he wants to see done, as does the MSG Network, Adamo said.
But no cablecaster yet does it all. "Years ago, it used to be one-camera coverage," he said, "but now with remote-controlled cameras and gadgets, we want to make games sound and look better."
Both Adamo and Solomon say that a future goal is to increase network exposure, which now consists entirely of the All-Star Game, on NBC, and five Stanley Cup games that will appear for the first time this season, on ABC.
"The good news is this isn't a new business where we have to learn what to do," he said. "I'm a broadcaster by trade and a hockey fanatic by love."
Adamo added, tongue in cheek, that one of his first tasks is to aid in the discovery of new broadcast phraseology to replace the hackneyed "Score!" or "He shoots! He scores!" or "Shot! Score!" when a player, uh, scores.
"There must be another way to say it," he said.

Fork In the Logic

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
"White man speak with forked tongue," observed several generations of Hollywood Indians, all of whom seemed to know what they were talking about even though present-day moralizers would probably convict them of political incorrectness in the first degree.
To this day the words come back to me whenever I contemplate the history of American racial relationships. All unwhite Americans would surely be better equipped for survival if they had grown up in homes with that antique Hollywood-Indian wisdom framed in needlepoint over the velveteen settee. 
 It is my belief that nothing is so politically incorrect that childhood's uncorrupted mind cannot extract a nugget of enduring wisdom from it. For years, among the bits of wisdom tacked up on the inside of my skull has been a warning from that hopelessly politically incorrect Chinese detective, Charlie Chan.
Chan was afflicted with an impetuous son who habitually jumped to the wrong conclusion about whatever his father happened to be investigating. Reprimanding this silly young man one Saturday afternoon at the Capitol Theater in Belleville, N.J., Chan said:
"He who speaks before thinking is like man who fires gun in dark room."
"Words to live by!" I must have instantly said to myself, mounting them in the back of my skull, for they still come back to haunt me whenever I feel the urge to tell the world why some wretched President simply won't do or, as in today's case, why the present President's wife may think with forked brain.
Heeding the wisdom of Charlie Chan, I have thought about this matter in minute detail, including the difficult question whether to refer to the President's wife as the First Lady. My decision: absolutely not. The word "lady" is odious to language watchers of the feminist movement, which feels protective of the President's wife.
Feminist lingo usually resolves these difficulties with the word "person," but it would be silly to call the President's wife "the First Person." As every survivor of sixth-grade grammar knows, the first person is "I" -- "we" in the plural -- and the instant you, dear reader, suspect another sixth-grade grammar lesson is afoot, you will turn this page into a paper airplane and sail it out the window, right?
In short, this subject has been thought out according to the precept of Chan. This emboldens me to suggest that the President's wife needs to get the fork out of her thinking about health matters.
She is, of course, in charge of creating a sensible health-care program. It is a costly proposition, and speculation encouraged by the Clinton people is that new taxes on tobacco and alcohol will be required to finance the program.
Why, then, has the President's wife banned smoking in the White House? The inevitable publicity flowing from her example is bound to be yet another blow to cigarette sales.
She obviously hopes to reduce cigarette consumption while counting on increased tax revenue from smokers to pay for health-care reform. Raising the tax while simultaneously trying to cut the number of people who will pay it suggests that the health- care financing problem has not been thought out with the thoroughness Charlie Chan would have insisted on.
In Hollywood-Indianspeak, it is forked logic.
Its political wisdom is also questionable. If the health-care program is to be financed by cigarette smokers and cigarette smoking is forbidden in the White House, what are we to think except that the White House is unwilling to pay its fair share of the bill?
Fairness, Stephanopoulos! What about fairness? Fairness demands that the White House smoke its fair share.
Charlie Chan might suspect there is more afoot here than meets the eye. It is comforting to think that clean-living, non-smoking, non-boozing folks can get a nice new health-care program free by riding on the backs of smoky and vinous sinners.
It's doubtful that the Clinton people really believe this. Surely they are toying with us on the matter of health-care costs, hoping to hold down the bad tax news until their economic program can be enacted.
Meantime, consistency might impel the President's wife not only to drop the cigarette ban in the White House but to urge all Americans to lighten their tax burden by lighting up.

HEADLINE: Social Investment Programs: Comparing the Past With the Promised Payoff

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
Were Bill Clinton to place a personal ad to support his vision of government, it might read something like this:
"Dynamic young President seeks contributions for social investments. Pay now, prosper later. Data to prove it on file." 
 Indeed, Mr. Clinton has called his emphasis on investment "the most fundamental change" he seeks in government. And he comes armed with studies that he says show that a dollar spent today on things like preschool programs and vaccines can save $3 or even $10 down the road.
"That's a good investment no matter how you measure it," he said in his recent address to Congress.
 
Some Notable Successes
 Few analysts doubt that some government programs have proved to be productive, even if measured narrowly, in economic rather than humanitarian terms. Two centuries of a public education system that has consistently produced taxpayers may offer one example; many scholars believe that the G.I. Bill of Rights, which filled universities with veterans after World War II, offers another.
But recent decades have also shown spottier records for dozens, if not hundreds, of social programs similarly justified as investments. And behind most of the figures that Mr. Clinton cites are mounds of social science research that leave even the best-informed scholars squabbling about whether the anticipated savings are real or imaginary.
"In the abstract, the talk about investment makes a lot of sense," said Douglas Besharov, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, who is skeptical of the President's arithmetic. "But give me a break: Nobody really believes these numbers."
Some of the "investments" Mr. Clinton advocates involve new programs. He wants apprenticeship plans that would give high school students technical skills. He also wants national service programs that would allow college graduates to work off their student loans.
Since these programs do not yet exist, evaluating their potential as investments is a theoretical pursuit, not an empirical one. The Job Training Partnership Act, a Federal training program, was justified on similar grounds, but one recent study found that it actually lowered the earnings of young men.
In other cases, the President is seeking to expand some of the nation's most scrutinized programs, like those that train mothers on welfare or tutor preschoolers. Many of these programs were created under earlier Administrations, which hoped to help people with them but not necessarily to save money.
While there are mounds of data about how some of these programs have performed, there is also much disagreement about what the data mean.
Perhaps no program is praised more lavishly by those who believe in the idea of investment than Head Start.
"We all know it saves money," says Mr. Clinton, who has proposed an increase in spending to about $7 billion a year in 1998 from current levels of $2.8 billion. "For every dollar we invest today, we'll save three tomorrow."
But his projected cost savings do not come from a Head Start program. Instead, they derive from a study of just 58 students in another early childhood education program, called the Perry Preschool, in Ypsilanti, Mich.
 
30-Year Track Record
 Researchers have continued to track the students, who enrolled in the program in 1962. Comparing them to a group of similar students who did not attend the school, they found that a significantly higher number of the Perry graduates finished high school and attended college. The students were also less likely to receive welfare or get arrested.
The researchers, Lawrence J. Schweinhart and David P. Weikart, arrived at the three-dollar figure by calculating what taxpayers would have spent on things like criminal justice, welfare and special education if the students had not gone to the preschool. Extrapolating in a recent article, they said the nation could achieve a "net annual profit" of $31 billion a year by enrolling all poor children in similar programs.
There is one catch: The Perry Preschool results have not been replicated in Head Start, which includes 1,300 programs of widely varying quality.
Consultants for the Department of Health and Human Services reviewed 210 Head Start studies in 1985. They found that the program does improve the cognitive performance of preschoolers, but that most of the effects wear off after two years.
The consultants did find that Head Start graduates remained less likely to fail a grade or to be placed in special education classes, but noted that "this finding is based on very few studies."
Citing this research, Mr. Clinton's critics say his promise of cost-savings is a hoax. "Three years later, you can't tell a Head Start child from a non-Head-Start child," said Mr. Besharov, who supports additional financing for the program but warns against grand expectations. "Few of us would make investments with our personal money with the kind of evidence that underlies these assertions."
Mr. Schweinhart contends that the Perry students have fared better because they received more intensive services. He said the program spent about twice as much per student than the average Head Start program does today, and provided them with more teachers, a better curriculum and more intensive home visits.
Although he says that "there's no reason on earth" the results could not be reproduced if Head Start received the same support, other scholars contend that large programs rarely replicate the results of the models they are based on.
The President's claims are open to similar questioning when he says that "we will save $10 later for every $1 we spend" on immunizations. Virtually every scholar who has studied immunization has concluded that it saves money. In 1988, the Office of Technology Assessment reviewed 15 such studies, and found cost savings that ranged from $3 to $25 for every dollar spent.
But Dr. Walter Orenstein, director of the immunization division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said most of those studies assumed that the clinics and personnel to deliver the services were already in place. By contrast, he said, the nation now needs to expand its clinics, which will drive up the costs of immunization.
He also said that some of the $300 million that Mr. Clinton is proposing to spend could go to vans and other outreach services. This is much more expensive than simply giving a waiting patient a shot.
"It's hard to say that if we add another dollar we'd save $10; clearly, it takes more to get the last kids vaccinated," he said. "But my guess is that it's still likely to remain cost-effective."
Mr. Clinton has also been enthusiastic about the investment potential of training programs for women on welfare, pledging to quadruple their financing to about $4 billion a year. Some of these programs have proved cost effective, more than paying for themselves by generating lower welfare costs and higher tax receipts.
But the successes have been modest. Three years after signing up for Project Success, a program Mr. Clinton ran as Governor of Arkansas, participants were still earning an average of only $1,422 a year, in addition to whatever welfare payments they collected. That was an average of $337 a year more than women who had not joined the program, but hardly the makings of a social revolution.
 
A Matter of Evaluation
 The President's challenge will be not only to finance the programs that work, but also to terminate those that do not. His record on this score is too new to judge.
But skeptics contend that hundreds of government programs continue to thrive despite poor results because they develop followings among the bureaucrats who run them and the contractors who profit.
"Look at the spending on public schools," said Irving Kristol, co-editor of The Public Interest, a journal of public policy. "It goes up and up and up, and the results go down and down and down. Unless we can see some results, how can you call it an investment?"
Mr. Kristol substitutes a different word for Mr. Clinton's investments: "spending."
As a real investor, the President might also insist on more rigorous evaluation of government programs, to discern which ones work and which do not. Mr. Schweinhart, the preschool evaluator, said most government bureaucracies resist such evaluations "because it runs considerable risk of making your program look bad."
Mr. Clinton's enthusiasts argue the significance of his oratory cannot be found in quibbles about his numbers. They believe that a nation in need of skilled workers can no longer afford to let a substantial number of its citizens fail, and that there is enough research to support the view that government programs can make a difference.
Though scholars debate the numbers, said Lisbeth Schorr, a lecturer at Harvard University, "as long as we know we're going in the right direction, we have to make the investment because the alternatives are so expensive -- to both government and society."

HEADLINE: Clinton Offers Tuition Aid Linked to National Service

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., March 1

 BODY:
President Clinton today outlined a plan for a national service program for college students that combined broad ambitions, high ideals and a modest beginning.
The program, which would begin with a 1,000-student pilot project this summer and expand to 100,000 by 1997, would allow students to help pay off their tuition debts by working as teachers or police officers, or with the homeless. 
 Speaking to a wildly enthusiastic Rutgers University audience on the 32d anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's founding of the Peace Corps, Mr. Clinton called on young Americans to "answer the call to service" at home with the same spirit that an earlier generation answered Kennedy's call for service abroad.
But reflecting some of the economic constraints that Kennedy did not have to worry about, Mr. Clinton insisted that he was not proposing the creation of another "entitlement" program. He vowed that his initiative could be built around state and local institutions and would not require establishment of a costly Federal bureaucracy.
 
A Role for Congress
 But he did not explain how, as the details are being worked out by his advisers. Congressional approval would be required, at least for financing.
The President declared that in return for tuition loans "we'll ask you to help our police forces across the nation, training members for a new police corps, that will walk beats, and work with neighborhoods and build the kind of community ties that will prevent crime from happening in the first place; we'll ask young people to work to help control pollution and recycle waste, to paint darkened buildings and clean up neighborhoods, to work with senior citizens and combat homelessness and help children in trouble."
Mr. Clinton said national service "is nothing less than the American way to change America."
To buttress his call to service, Mr. Clinton marshaled some very new and some very old political messengers. After his speech, he ducked into the men's locker room and taped an interview with Tabitha Soren of MTV for broadcast tonight. In the interview, Mr. Clinton repeated that he favored higher taxes for cigarettes: "Smoking ought to bear more of the cost of the health-care problems that it causes."
 
Shriver Approves
 While Mr. Clinton was performing for MTV behind the scenes, a voice from the past, R. Sargent Shriver, Kennedy's brother-in-law and the first director of the Peace Corps, was brought to the press room by White House aides to put the stamp of approval on Mr. Clinton's initiative.
Mr. Shriver provided not only the expected endorsement but some sobering contrasts between the Kennedy era, when the problem of getting people to serve seemed to be just a shortage of will, to the Clinton era, when the problem is also a shortage of money.
"This program is appropriate for today, as opposed to when we started the Peace Corps," Mr. Shriver said. "The reality today is that most people getting out of college have incurred large, large debts. The climate is different, but I think this is true: Young people are still idealistic. They have not been given a chance. With the budgetary restrictions that now exist, it means it is going to be very difficult to get it to a huge size. That doesn't mean it shouldn't be started, but with the shortage of money now one has to be satisfied with achieving modest goals."
Mr. Clinton emphasized that because of budget and bureaucratic constraints his program would begin with a $15 million, eight-week "Summer of Service" program for roughly 1,000 teen-agers from poor neighborhoods or broken homes in up to 10 communities.
 
What They Might Do
 Participants would help health-care providers administer immunization programs for young children, tutor illiterates, teach recreational programs to children at risk of dropping out of school and test neighborhoods for risk of lead paint.
Summer of Service participants would receive a minimum-wage stipend and a post-service benefit of $1,000 to be applied to education or training. Mr. Clinton has asked Congress to finance the program as part of the $31 billion in spending on roads, bridges and communication links he is proposing to spur the economy.
The tuition-for-service program would also begin small, with $389 million in scholarships for about 25,000 students in the first year, growing to $3.4 billion by 1997, when the program is expected to include more than 100,000 students, according to the White House. Mr. Clinton has already asked for the financing as part of the economic recovery package he presented to Congress.
As outlined by Mr. Clinton, the program would work like this: students would fill community service jobs for a set number of years for part or all of their tuition, for either college or certified technical training. They could perform the community service before college, and earn part or all of their tuition in advance, or borrow directly from the Federal Government and pay it back slowly as a percentage of their income, through payroll deductions or as part of their income tax filings.
In his campaign manifesto, "Putting People First," Mr. Clinton proposed to "scrap the existing student loan program and establish a National Service Trust Fund to guarantee every American who wants a college education the means to obtain one."
In his speech in Madison Square Garden accepting the Democratic nomination, Mr. Clinton declared: "We'll say: everybody can borrow the money to go to college. But you must do your part. You must pay it back -- from your paychecks, or better yet, by going back home and serving your communities."
To prevent the establishment of a huge bureaucracy, Clinton Administration officials want it based around existing community-service projects, which would be certified as authentic by the Government, and then be allowed to enroll a set number of graduates for jobs and be partly reimbursed for their salaries by the Government.
Many listeners echoed the idea of service -- and saving money. "I thought his speech really energized everybody," said Jackie Frank, a 20-year-old junior. "We were just saying a lot of people are going to become a lot more involved, and with being able to earn tuition for it is a great way to do it."

When President Clinton returns to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, this time as the invited luncheon guest of Congressional Republicans, he may feel as though he is eating in the Tower of Babel, with everyone speaking a different economic language.
Traditional Republican conservatives argue for reducing the Federal deficit by making specific cuts in programs they consider wasteful, like rural electrification. Reaganite supply-siders steam about proposed tax increases, arguing for growth over austerity. And still other lawmakers say they are content to criticize the broad outlines of the Clinton economic policy and hope that the fractious Congressional Democrats will themselves pick apart the details of the package. 
 The Republicans' first formal meeting with Mr. Clinton, along with their first challenge to a piece of the Administration's economic program on the Senate floor, will give them their best opportunity so far to slow down the Administration's public relations steamroller.
But some Republicans express concern that their many voices at Tuesday's lunch may only help promote the impression that the President has offered the only coherent program for growth and deficit reduction. "We won't be in perfect harmony," Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, a ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, predicted in careful understatement.
 
Uniting Against Stimulus
 To counter that danger, Republicans say they will try to concentrate on one thing they all oppose: the President's $16.3 billion plan for a short-term economic stimulus, which they contend would unnecessarily increase the deficit. They will also criticize Mr. Clinton for relying on tax increases while making no significant reduction in net spending.
The most optimistic Republicans hope to enlist enough conservative Democrats on Tuesday to pass an amendment offered by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, to force Federal spending cuts as a means of paying for a $5.7 billion extension of emergency unemployment benefits that Mr. Clinton has urged. Without the cuts, the added benefits will increase the deficit.
"It would show we are here as players," said Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Republican whip.
Republican lawmakers have been grappling for a consistent legislative approach. While they strongly oppose what they view as Mr. Clinton's traditional Democratic approach of taxing and spending, they do not want to be seen as agents of gridlock.
 
Hopes on Senate Panel
 The Republicans need to regain unity if they are to have any chance of challenging Mr. Clinton's economic program. Unless the President stumbles in making his sales pitch, their best hope appears to be in the Senate Finance Committee, where they hold 9 of 20 seats. If they can unite there and win over a few Democrats on some important tax votes, they might still have an impact on the final legislation.
Mr. Dole and Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House minority leader, met this afternoon to come up with a united Republican strategy, or at least to present a united face to the public. The two leaders agreed to assemble House and Senate Republicans from the Budget, Appropriations, Ways and Means and Finance committees this week to formulate common economic positions.
"I don't know whether you bridge the gaps entirely," Mr. Dole conceded in an interview after the meeting. "But if you don't stick together you are not much of a player around here. We have some who want an alternative package, some who don't. Some want no taxes. So we're not there yet."
The party's cacophony reached a particularly discordant pitch last week when two leading Senate Republicans offered differing visions of how the party should oppose the Clinton economic policy. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a 1996 Presidential hopeful, announced he would propose an amendment to the Clinton budget capping domestic spending and eliminating the need to raise any Social Security, income or energy taxes.
 
Dole's Differing Strategy
 Mr. Gramm told reporters he opposed efforts by some Republicans to develop an alternative budget, with specified cuts, because "if we put a full-blown substitute out there, we're going to allow the President to do what he wants to do -- to change the subject."
Mr. Gramm added that he was confident the Republican Senate leadership would back his amendment, suggesting he had come up with the party alternative. But almost as he spoke, Mr. Dole rose on the floor to outline a far different program.
Mr. Dole said he wanted to cut about $100 billion from Mr. Clinton's proposed $178 billion in new domestic spending, while Mr. Gramm's amendment would cut all of it. Then, over the weekend, Mr. Dole said he wished Mr. Gramm had waited before proposing the amendment, and pointedly said he planned to talk to Mr. Gramm.
To complicate matters, Jack F. Kemp, the former Housing Secretary and another potential Presidential candidate, offered a third economic alternative. Dusting off some Reagan-era proposals, Mr. Kemp proposed to spur economic growth by reducing payroll tax rates, increasing the personal tax exemptions for families with children and indexing capital gains taxes, depreciation allowances and corporate tax rates.
 
Then There's the House
 "I have not heard any unanimity at all," said Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont. "There is no coalescing between either the supply-siders or the cutters."
Meanwhile, Senate and House Republicans have been slow to coordinate strategies. Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, has been busy compiling a list of budget cuts, an effort some Senate Republicans fear could draw the ire of special interest groups away from the President onto their party.
"It may well be that Kasich and the House Republicans will introduce their own plan," Mr. Chafee noted. "We have enough trouble getting a solidified position out of 43 Republican Senators without getting into complete lockstep with the House."

HEADLINE: States Have Problem With 'Sin' Revenue: There's Less Sinning

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 1

 BODY:
To the dismay of lawmakers who have religiously depended on revenue from "sin taxes" on tobacco and alcoholic beverages to help balance state budgets, people are sinning less.
Across the Northeast and much of the nation, revenue from taxes on tobacco and alcohol has fallen by millions of dollars in recent years, driven down by health concerns, changing social mores and the opportunity to make cheaper purchases elsewhere -- legally or illegally. 
 New Jersey has the happy or unhappy distinction of being a leader in this trend. In the proposed 1994 budget that he presented last month, Gov. Jim Florio adjusted the estimated income from 1993 taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages from $357 million to $333 million. And the administration now projects that revenue from sin taxes will drop $17 million more in the 1994 fiscal year, which begins on July 1.
In New York, officials are expecting revenue from alcohol taxes to fall by $6.6 million in the new fiscal year, to $229 million, and cigarette and other tobacco tax receipts to tumble by $32 million, to $525 million.
In Connecticut, revenue from cigarette taxes for 1992-93 is expected to approach but not exceed the nearly $63.8 million the state made in 1991-92. Income from alcohol taxes is expected to fall at least $2.5 million from the $23 million of a year ago.
If the decline continues as expected, tax officials say cash-poor state and local governments will be forced to raise other taxes, impose new ones or cut services.
Even as states are beginning to realize the limitations of sin taxes, Federal officials are growing more interested in them. On Thursday President Clinton strongly suggested for the first time that he would propose higher taxes on tobacco to pay for his health-care program, saying that "bad health habits" had cost the country a lot of money.
"The golden goose of sin taxes is just about cooked," said Ronald Alt, a senior research associate with the Federation of Tax Administrators, based in Washington. The federation is a nonprofit group representing tax agencies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and New York City.
 
Smaller Part of State Revenue
 "Excise taxes generate much smaller percentages of state revenue then they did 10 to 20 years ago," said Mr. Alt, citing statistics from the United States Census. "Excise taxes fell from providing 26 percent of budget revenue for the states in 1972 to 16 percent in 1991."
Besides alcohol and tobacco, excise taxes are imposed by various states on gasoline, telephone calls, heating and electricity, car registrations and, in New Jersey, Atlantic City casino profits. But alcohol and tobacco taxes have historically been the easiest to raise, in part because religious teachings have long singled out drinking and smoking as sins.
Many people trace the beginning of the drain on sin taxes back to 1964, when the Surgeon General's report cited health problems caused by cigarette smoking. More recent reports have addressed the dangers of alcohol, especially to pregnant women.
Other factors have resulted in a precipitous drop in the number of drinkers and heavy smokers over the past five years: restrictions on smoking in restaurants and workplaces, an increase in anti-smoking education programs, and a trend among younger adults for less expensive drinks with lower alcoholic contents, like wine and beer over bourbon or vodka.
 
Taxation as a Curb
 Anti-smoking groups, like the American Lung Association, and some insurers argue that sin taxes should be raised even higher, not to raise money but to force people to stop or at least sharply curtail smoking and drinking. In the case of young people, they say, an added economic burden may be enough to keep them from starting the habit. If their theory is true, the next generation of politicians would not be able to depend on sin taxes.
Tax officials in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut say that higher sin taxes do force some people to give up cigarettes or alcohol. But in many cases, especially with smokers, a person might simply cross the border to a state with lower taxes to stock up on tobacco products.
Residents of southern New Jersey routinely drive across the border into Delaware to buy cigarettes, which are taxed at 24 cents a pack with no sales tax. In New Jersey, the state tax on a pack of cigarettes is 40 cents, plus a 6 percent sales tax. Still, some New York City smokers cross the Hudson River to stock up on cigarettes in New Jersey to avoid their local 47-cent tax on cigarettes (39 cents state, and 8 cents city) and 8.25 percent sales tax.
Mr. Janschewitz, the Connecticut tax official, describes the practice as "border hopping" and complains that it costs the state millions in revenue.
 
Big Bootlegging Trade
 "We only have 15 police officers to patrol the borders, and until we erect a wall around the state there is not going to be any effective means to keeping someone from hopping across the border to Massachusetts or New York State to take advantage of lower rates," he said.
In New York, bootlegging, hijackings, warehouse thefts and the counterfeiting of cigarette tax stamps are big business, said Karl E. Felson, a spokesman for the New York Department of Taxation and Finance. He said there is also an increasing problem with untaxed cigarettes being smuggled from Indian reservations.
The erosion of sin taxes as a reliable and easy source of income could not come at a worse time for budgetmakers and politicians who have traditionally used them to avoid imposing or increasing more politically unpopular taxes on incomes and sales.
In a report due for release this month, the Council of State Governments, based in Lexington, Ky., calls sin taxes "a worn-out tax source" and warns states to begin immediately to look for new sources of revenue to pay for health care, schools, prisons and other costs.
 
'May Be Fooling Themselves'
 "States looking for cash may be fooling themselves by turning to tried and true taxes," Doug Olberding, a research associate with the council, wrote in February in the group's magazine, "State Government News." "Old standbys like the cigarette, motor fuels and traditional sales tax are likely to leave states spinning their wheels when it comes to generating future revenue growth."
The council's report has already generated controversy, because it was fully financed by Philip Morris, the tobacco company. But even greater anger was provoked by the report's conclusion that state and local governments should begin to impose taxes on service industries.
"When you get your hair cut, the barber may be paying sales taxes on the supplies he is using, but there is no tax on the haircut itself," Mr. Olberding said in an interview. He said the same rationale should apply for the services of an automobile mechanic, a person who writes a computer program or the one who designs an advertising campaign.
"I kind of got it from all sides," said Mr. Olberding, "advertising organizations, labor groups, the American Lung Association. There are a lot of political and practical problems to taxing services, but it is something states are going to have to look at."
 
Taxation's 'Cash Cows'
 Until recently, Connecticut depended on its sales taxes and taxes on cigarettes and alcohol to provide most of the income to run the state.
"Up until 1991, the sales tax was the workhorse, but the sin taxes were looked at as the cash cows," said A. J. Janschewitz, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services. "They could be racheted up fairly politically painlessly. The idea was we are going to impose more taxes on things that are bad for you."
But even after its tax on a package of cigarettes reached 45 cents, the highest of any state, Connecticut went on to impose its first state income tax two years ago.
Revenue continues to drop from sin taxes, which together with gift taxes, a tax on oyster beds and several other minor taxes account for 15 percent of Connecticut's revenue.
"It is hard to say which well we are going to turn to when the sin taxes well starts to go dry on us," Mr. Janschewitz said.

HEADLINE: CRISIS AT THE TWIN TOWERS: Vignettes;
Going Back to Work, or Then Again, Maybe Not

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
The chic wore "I Survived Terror at the Towers" T-shirts. The disgruntled waited on hourlong lines to retrieve winter coats, wallets and keys under escort from offices in the twin towers. The cognoscenti at the commodity exchanges trafficked in rumor. "Saddam Hussein is behind this," a man called to a friend in an elevator. "That's what's circulating on the oil floor."
And then there were people like Cynthia Ortiz. 
 She conquered her fear of another bomb. She rode the PATH train from Jersey City, falling into a hush as everyone else did when the train entered the World Trade Center station. But when she reached her unheated office at Dean Witter, Discover & Company, she hadn't even had time to change out of her sneakers before finding that other, more essential employees from one of the closed twin towers had taken over her desk.
"When we came in to work today the supervisor said we shouldn't have come in," said the 22-year-old clerk, roaming the chaotic trade center concourse hand-in-hand with her co-worker Lisa Vazquez from the Bronx. Both were giddy and bewildered by their unexpected day off. "We don't know what to do," she wailed. "We're used to coming to work."
Three days after a bombing trapped thousands of workers in the chaos of collapsing floors, stuck elevators and smoke-filled, dark stairwells, a third of the 12-million-square-foot World Trade Center complex was open and thousands back at work. Many more employees milled about, almost as a statement of pride and grit even if there was nothing for them to do.
"It's New York. It's just a typical day in New York," said Daniel Fanelli, a clerk in the Sugar, Coffee and Cocoa Exchange, who was smoking in the impromptu smoking corner that had sprung up in the lobby of 4 World Trade Center since fire marshals had banned smoking in the building.
People were even, well, nice. "The people are very kind. I think more kind," said Elena Kachkina, selling coffee and pastry at the fast-food shop Sbarro, and surprised that customers wanted to linger and chat.
 
Time for Coffee Now
 Business was off through much of lower Manhattan yesterday. But not for everybody. At the Essex World coffee shop at Liberty and Church Streets near the trade center, it was like the golden days of the 1980's.
"Business dropped 50 percent since the crash of '89," said Tasso Mouhteros, 38, an employee. But yesterday, counters and tables were packed for breakfast and lunch as the disaster left people with time to kill.
"If we have to wait for a bomb to go off, that's pretty sad. It's horrible," Mr. Mouhteros said. But he added, "Everybody was joking today, 'Let's have another bomb.' "
Friday was the unexpectedly busy day for J.R. Tobacco, a cigar store at Broadway and Vesey Street. "It was like Christmas in here," said the manager. "One guy came in, he walked down 70 flights of stairs. He had smoke on his face, and he bought a box of cigars."
 
Tables of Experts
 The Big Kitchen, a sprawling room on the concourse level of the World Trade Center, was a cafeteria. But now it's a one-stop-shopping, 24-hour command center for the hard-hatted forces marshaled from Government agencies and private firms to repair the damage to the bombed complex.
Bleary-eyed and sustained by countless cups of coffee, they plot strategy over blueprints and shout commands into walkie-talkies in a room that looks like a crowded convention hall -- complete with dozens of tables adorned with signs like "Plants and Structures," "Asbestos" and "Otis Elevator."
"We're trying to compress decisions and implementation into a very difficult time frame," said Frank Lombardi, an assistant chief engineer at the Port Authority who is overseeing more than 10 engineering firms and contractors.
Officials said they initially faced difficulties organizing their efforts because they lacked computers and files that were in Port Authority offices in the towers.
Paul S. Marchese, chief of planning and design at the World Trade Center, said that over the weekend, he had to send police officers to offices around New York City to retrieve blueprints of the center. The plans have proved so vital to the repair operation that clerks have been making copies of them around the clock. A basic set is about 100 pages long and 2 inches thick.
"Within minutes of the explosion, we lost every system we had," said Mr. Marchese, who by yesterday morning had slept only six hours since the explosion. "We were just crippled. Everything was on computers upstairs in the towers. We were pulling drawings out of the archives."
 
Not Perfect Timing
 Just three days after the bombing downtown, there in Times Square yesterday was a five-story hot-air balloon of Arnold Schwartzenegger brandishing three sticks of dynamite in his left hand and a gun in his right.
For pedestrians who usually seem unfazed by the preachers, the peddlers and the beggers, it was too much. "I think it's pretty sick, absolutely crazy," said Tim Camroy. "I think it's terrible with what happened at the World Trade Center."
"Oh my God," said one woman as she stopped in front of the puffed-up Schwarzenegger, which was dressed in Ostrich boots, blue jeans, red T-shirt and brown leather jacket. "That's awful."
The balloon is a prop for "Last Action Hero," a movie in production by Columbia Pictures. Chance Helburn, a production assistant, called the timing a coincidence. "It's too bad," he said, "but this has been planned to be here for months."
 
Opportunity Knocks
 The World Trade Center explosion may be a disaster for many. But not all. Faster than an express subway, entrepreneurs have descended.
"I see a building blow up in the heart of the world, but I also see opportunity," said Ronald Bowman, who leases office space at the Newport Financial Center in Jersey City and who began working to steal companies from the complex within 45 minutes of the blast. "Where there's adversity, there's also opportunity."
Lumbermen, cleaners, electricians, promoters, salvage experts, office-supply salesmen -- all had the same dream of a fast dollar. There were several T-shirt makers. Their words were slightly different, but the idea was the same: "I Survived Terror at the Towers," or "I Survived the Twin Towers Disaster."
Most scoffed at any suggestion they were benefiting from others' misfortune and described themselves as commercial Darwinists, businessmen fighting to survive. "As much as I feel the pain of the loss of life, I'm in the business of leasing space," Mr. Bowman said. "I don't pretend to be benevolent."
Several real-estate salespeople and owners of commercial buildings bought ads in yesterday's newspapers touting their properties. Sylvan Lawrence Company advertized space in the nine downtown properties it manages and prepared a mailing to all of the World Trade Center's tenants.
Many leasors said they would accept short-term deals in the hope that a brief stay would lead to a long-term relationship. "A doctor who does a job with minor surgery is the one you'll go to if you need a major operation," said John Brod, managing director of Koeppel Tener Riguardi, which ran several ads for space.
And The New York Post, which is in the process of being acquired by Steven Hoffenberg, ran a four-inch-by-two-inch ad offering World Trade Center companies "computer-ready space, with phone and fax equipment, and support staff" at the paper's plant in lower Manhattan. Needy readers were instructed to call Hirschfeld Realty, whose primary owner is Abraham Hirschfeld, at a number accompanying the ad. Mr. Hirschfeld has announced he will be an investor in The Post. But the number was wrong. Post operators referred inquiries to the classified advertising department, which also gave a caller the wrong number.
Karla Kaudatzky, an agent with Galbraith Riverbank, which manages 90 West Street, said walk-in trade has been so heavy that she expects to sign several tenants by the end of the week. And in the best news for commercial property owners, she said she thought she could avoid the up-front concessions that became de rigueur during the recession.
"What happened in the World Trade Center puts us in a better position to negotiate harder," she said.
William Goldstein, the World Trade Center's deputy director for capital programs, said that while the explosion is a blow to the region's economy, which is just emerging from the recession, reconstruction and repair of the complex will pump millions of dollars into the depressed construction trades. "It's not exactly the way we wanted to prime the pump, but there's a lot of work to do," he noted.
 
Big Business Headaches
 And then there were the big businesses. The ones with workers suddenly scattered at temporary quarters all over the metropolitan region.
At Eurobrokers, a money broker at 1 World Trade Center that gives major banks and securities dealers a market for borrowing and lending dollars, the lack of direct phone lines in temporary office space was costing business, said Keith Riehl, chief financial officer, who was answering the phone yesterday at one temporary office in the New York Telephone building at 100 Church Street.
Eurobrokers uses its office-to-office lines to call customers instantly, avoiding the regular telephone system, Mr. Reihl said. "We normally have anywhere from 400 to 500 direct lines," he said. "It's possible we'll get some on Wednesday or Thursday. But our customer will be talking to someone else that got hold of him sooner, and he'll trade with him."

HEADLINE: Cyclicals Fall, as Dow Slips 15.40, to 3,355.41

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Transportation stocks and other cyclical issues fell sharply yesterday as investors struggled to spot the implications of the latest economic statistics against the backdrop of President Clinton's budget proposal.
After an initial rally, apparently animated by gains in the bond market, the Dow Jones industrial average retreated, ending the day with a decline of 15.40 points, to 3,355.41. The Dow transportation average, meanwhile, plummeted 33.44 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,484.66. 
 Trading was a relatively light 237 million shares, as some traders and money managers moved from the World Trade Center and others were distracted by the commotion.
More than five Big Board issues advanced for every four that declined, as the pullbacks in cyclical issues accounted for the drops in most market averages.
The truckers, airlines, metals, papers, computers and chemicals that fell tended to be among the stocks most sensitive to the economy. Yesterday's batch of economic figures suggested slower growth than at the end of last year, but strategists were cautious about blaming these numbers or President Clinton's plans for the market's performance.
 
'Revelations' Come Slowly
 "We're in a period of confusion," said Byron R. Wien, United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. "Unfortunately, the stock market is open every day, but revelations about what the new plan means to the economy come only slowly."
Among transporation issues, the Xtra Corporation, a trucking company, fell 2 points to 83 7/8; Federal Express 1 7/8, to 54 1/2; Delta Air Lines 1 5/8, to 47 5/8, and Ryder System 1 1/2, to 27 3/4. Proposals for higher energy taxes deepened the declines, analysts said.
The damage was widespread among heavy industries, as the USX steel group fell 2 3/8, to 34 7/8; Inland Steel 1 3/4, to 20 3/8; International Paper 1 1/8, to 63 1/8, and B. F. Goodrich 1, to 41 3/4.
Some analysts pointed out that the economically sensitive stocks until recently have run ahead of the rest of the market, and were now pulling back.
"You have increased the gap between the cyclicals and noncyclicals to an unsustainable level," said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at Kemper Securities. "We are probably in the process of filling the gap."
 
Tobacco Stocks Off
 The threat of a higher Federal tobacco tax to pay for changes in the nation's health-care system continued to afflict tobacco stocks, with Philip Morris off 1 7/8, to 65 1/4, and RJR Nabisco off 1/8, to 8 3/8, both on heavy volume. Medical stocks, however, staged a comeback.
Some negative reviews from analysts pounded stocks including Compaq Computer, off 3 3/8, to 41 7/8, and H & R Block, off 3, to 38 3/8 -- in the middle of tax season, yet. Microtest Inc., which supplies computer networking equipment, fell 7 points, to 7 1/2, after reporting slower sales and increased competition.
 
Nasdaq Composite Down
 A broad retreat in the major computer issues pulled the Nasdaq Composite index down 1.26 points, to 669.51. Dell Computer fell 1 5/8, to 30 1/2; Adobe Systems 1 5/8, to 43; Oracle Systems 1 1/4, to 31 1/2; Microsoft 1 7/8, to 81 1/2, and Intel 1 1/4, to 115 1/4.
The smaller Nasdaq stocks finished virtually even, however, as the Russell 2000 gained 0.02 point, to 222.43.
Friday's explosion at the World Trade Center slowed activity even among many brokerage firms that were not forced to find new quarters themselves. Thomas Gallagher, the head of trading at Oppenheimer & Company, spent much of the day figuring out how to accommodate the visiting staff of the mutual fund group that his firm used to own. That group is now normally based in the World Trade Center, which is just across the street from Oppenheimer's offices.
Mr. Gallagher spent much of the day away from the trading desks, but had few regrets. "This was just to be neighborly," Mr. Gallagher said. "Next time, it could just as well be our building."

Digital to Show New PC's, Expanding a Product Line

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

 BODY:
The Digital Equipment Corporation, continuing its effort to become a major competitor in personal computers, will display a new family of machines today.
The new DECpc MT line extends the family of computers the company introduced last summer -- machines that Digital is designing and building itself. In some of its previous efforts to sell personal computers, Digital bought and resold machines from other companies like Tandy and Olivetti. 
 The new systems, all based on the Intel 486 microprocessor, are more powerful and expandable versions of the LP line of personal computers that Digital introduced last summer. They are also designed to be quiet and compact for machines of their power class.
 
On, Not Under, the Desk
 Enrico Pesatori, vice president and general manager of Digital's personal computer business unit, said the new machines included increased storage capacity, expansion slots and a larger power supply, all built into a 17-inch-high box that fits on a desktop. A system this powerful generally must be built as a much larger box or "tower" that sits under or next to a desk. The machines also have a two-speed fan, for quieter operation when the computer is not running at full capacity.
The MT machines will sell for between $2,350 and $2,800, $250 more a system than DEC LP machines.
Mr. Pesatori, who arrived at Digital from Zenith Data Systems four weeks ago, acknowledged that Digital was still a relatively minor force in the personal computer wars.
"We're a slice of the pie," he said, "but a slice for someone on a diet."
 
No. 7 in PC's
 Daniel Ness, a researcher with Computer Intelligence, a La Jolla, Calif., market research firm, said Digital had made significant inroads in the personal computing market in just a year, leaping from 22d in market share to 7th. He added, though, that Digital held only 2 percent of the market.
Mr. Pesatori predicted that the company would probably rank as high as fifth in the personal computer industry in two years.
Neal Hill, a consultant with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., said, "Digital is starting to really leverage its strength." He said Digital engineers had always built machines with an emphasis on superior design and engineering.
Mr. Hill added that Digital was able to offer prices competitive with those of low-priced direct-mail distributors like Gateway 2000, a feat he described as "quite stunning for a large company like Digital." He predicted that Digital would generate $1 billion in personal computer revenues this year, "which makes them a serious player."
"This," Mr. Hill said, "is probably the first of many aggressive strokes we will see from Pesatori."

HEADLINE: Neediest Cases Drive Ends With Surge

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Despite a grinding recession that has provoked fears of growing hardship, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund ended its 81st annual campaign on Sunday with its second-highest total ever. Nearly 14,000 donors from around the world helped the appeal raise $4,469,034.47.
The fund initially fell sharply behind the last campaign's pace, but it gained ground over the last month. The surge is a testimony to the compassion of readers who responded to predictions that thousands of people might go without food, clothing, shelter and health care if the campaign did not reach its goal. 
 In the end, the fund fell short of last year's appeal, a record $5,083,550.81, but it passed the 1990-91 effort, which took in $4,439,093.47.
"Thanks to a vigorous spurt in donations during the last few weeks, the drive ended with the second-best year in our history," said Arthur Gelb, president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the Neediest Cases. "On behalf of all the benefiting charities, we are grateful to our contributors who made this possible."
 
Reflected in Lives
 But the numbers do not tell the whole story. The success of the Neediest Cases campaign is reflected in the lives of people across New York City -- from Rene P. Velez of Brooklyn, who has taken enormous strides in conquering mental illness, to Alice Jones of Harlem, who has drawn strength from the Children's Aid Society as she rears her two grandsons.
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund was founded in the early years of this century by Adolph S. Ochs, then the publisher of The Times. He reasoned that if the newspaper's readers knew about the suffering around them, they would be eager to give.
He was right. The fund has raised tens of millions of dollars since then from hundreds of thousands of donors who felt that they could not turn their backs on New York City residents facing daunting challenges.
This year's total included dozens of checks from people who were honoring the memory of Patrick Daly, the principal in Red Hook, Brooklyn, who the police said was slain in the crossfire of a drug dispute. Others paid tribute to Arthur Ashe, Thurgood Marshall and Audrey Hepburn, all of whom died recently.
 
Praising Donors
 The 1992-93 appeal ended on Sunday, but additional donations will be accepted throughout the year and recorded in the next campaign, which will begin in late November. The Times pays the fund's expenses, so all contributions go directly to seven charities in New York City.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Serves Clinton Familiar Doubts

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
He ate birthday cake with the House Republicans. The Senate Republicans fed him a Big Mac and fries.
It was all smiles on both sides of the aisle today as President Clinton made his first trip to Capitol Hill to confer with Republican lawmakers, and they expressed their gratitude with his beloved junk food. 
 But beyond the conviviality and the french fries, the meetings ended with the Republicans' repeating their familiar misgiving about the President's economic plan, which, they say, is too laden with tax increases and too light on spending cuts.
 
Clinton Seeks Consultation
 Conferring first with House Republican leaders, and then over lunch with Republican Senators, Mr. Clinton said his aim was "to consult," not negotiate, over his economic program. At both sessions, participants said, the President delivered brief get-acquainted messages and then opened himself to questions on everything from the economy to health care to welfare reform.
It is virtually unheard of for a President to go to Capitol Hill expressly to call on lawmakers from the rival party. Congressional veterans said they could not recall a similar session in recent years.
And many Republicans seemed pleased, even grateful, for the attention. "The President of the United States is a charming fellow," said Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee.
 
Warning Amid Friendly Talk
 The participants said the talks were cordial, with Mr. Clinton often calling members by their first names. But the Republicans did not hold back in questioning elements of his economic program, particularly the proposed energy tax. And they warned him not to combine it with his health-care package, a move that many Republicans complain would create enormous tax increases. White House officials had said they were considering that combination idea to help ease the programs' passage through Congress.
After the session, some House members said Mr. Clinton suggested that he had not proposed more budget cuts because they would not have been acceptable to Congressional Democrats.
"The message was, and the real point of the story is," Mr. Kasich said, "is that he indicated frustration with being able to get any spending cuts through this Congress."
But White House officials denied that Mr. Clinton had put out that message. "We haven't had a vote yet on it," said Howard Paster, the chief Congressional liaison. "There's no way he would have expressed that. What the Congressmen are expressing was that they made it clear to him that his interest in cutting the deficit was real, and he wants Congress to join him in doing that."
Despite such different interpretations, White House officials and Republican lawmakers alike pronounced the meetings a success. But no one was willing to say that Mr. Clinton had won converts to his economic plan.
 
Toward Understanding
 "He made a lot of friends he already had," said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader. "But converts? I think that wasn't the purpose of the session."
Mr. Paster said: "I'm not sure we came away with any votes. But I'm sure we came away with people understanding Bill Clinton better. And we hope some votes as well."
Administration officials said the goal of the meeting was more than winning support for the economic program. They said that they were confident they had a majority of House Democrats supporting the plan and that what they were now seeking was the support of a handful of Senate Republicans who might be needed for a majority in that chamber.
One Republican whose vote Mr. Clinton may be able to win, Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, said he was impressed with Mr. Clinton's presentation. "He was in great form," said Mr. Hatfield, the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee. "He handled it in a Q-and-A format, and he spoke in a straightforward way with great knowledge of the issues."
Leon E. Panetta, the White House budget director who was a veteran House Democrat, said he did not expect support for the economic program among House Republicans. But he said that their backing did not really matter.
"In the Senate," Mr. Panetta said in an interview, "the question becomes: How many Democrats will you lose? If you can't hold the Democrats together, there may be a point where you have to begin to negotiate with Republicans."
 
Other Goals Suggested
 But Senator Daniel R. Coats, Republican of Indiana, suggested that the President had more ambitious goals in mind in his visit to Capitol Hill. "He doesn't necessarily need one Republican vote in order to pass this program," Mr. Coats said. "But he needs to determine whether he needs to work with Republicans on longer-range issues like health care, like welfare reform, like a second-year budget. He obviously runs the risk of reaching out to Republicans with additional spending cuts only to lose people on his side."
The spectacle of Mr. Clinton clowning around with Republicans may be short-lived. Those he met with included some of his harshest critics, like Mr. Dole and Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and they will no doubt return to that role soon enough.
For the cameras, it was all fun and games. First, Mr. Clinton presented a vanilla-frosted cake with a Capitol dome and blue sparklers to Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, on his 70th birthday. Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore joined about 50 Republicans in singing "Happy Birthday" and then the President said, "I realize this is against my best interests, but I'm going to invite you to make a wish."
Mr. Michel responded, "I don't know if your economic plan is going to be like cutting a piece of cake or not."
The President then gave Mr. Michel a copy of a black baseball cap worn by the Chicago Cubs in 1914, and said, "We're both long-suffering Cubs fans."
He then strolled to the Senate side of the Capitol, where the Senate Republicans presented him with a $250 check for the jogging track he is building at the White House. They also gave him a huge veto pen to signify their support for a line-item veto.
In addition, Mr. Dole gave Mr. Clinton a book, "Murder in the Senate," by Senator William Cohen, Republican of Maine.
Noting that he had already read the book, Mr. Clinton said, "The guy who got killed is a Democrat, though."
To which Mr. Dole responded, "So, it had a happy ending."
Beneath the gags, the Republicans raised several serious topics. "Concerns were raised about some of the defense cuts, afraid of what it might mean to our ability to be able to defend our country and protect our freedom," said Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma. "There were concerns raised about the energy tax and how expensive it would be, and how many jobs it would cost. And on the overall economic package, as far as it being weighed too heavily on taxes."
Careful not to be too critical or too complimentary, the Republicans were perhaps waiting to see just how committed Mr. Clinton is to listening to lawmakers on hostile turf.

HEADLINE: Albany at Odds Over Revenue Figures

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 2

 BODY:
Only 29 days before the start of the new fiscal year, the Governor, the Assembly Speaker and the State Senate majority leader have yet to agree on how much money the state has to spend, much less how to spend it.
All three now believe that the state's economic prospects are improving somewhat and that revenues for the 1993-94 fiscal year will exceed the original projection made in January by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. 
 But the three estimates are separated by hundreds of millions of dollars, and the first political skirmish of this year's budget battle is expected to be defined by how the competing projections are reconciled.
Whatever revenue estimate is accepted, the state still will face a significant budget gap for the fiscal year that begins on April 1, leaving state leaders to negotiate heavy cuts in spending and increases in taxes and fees.
 
Proposal From Weprin
 Legislative and gubernatorial aides predicted today that they would agree on a revenue number relatively quickly. But even if they put that dispute to rest, their broader talks on the budget could be muddied if Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin proposes raising personal income tax rates for top wage earners.
Assembly officials said today that Mr. Weprin, a Queens Democrat, is considering such a proposal, which would mirror the tax increase envisioned by President Clinton. Mr. Cuomo and the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Long Island Republican, have vowed to oppose increases in the state's broad-based taxes.
The Governor's Budget Director, Patrick J. Bulgaro, announced today that he believes the state will collect $501 more in revenues for its general fund than the $31.5 billion in spending outlined by Mr. Cuomo in his Jan. 19 budget proposal. Most of the change in the estimate was generated by slightly more optimistic projections of personal income tax and sales tax collections, he said.
The Democratic Governor also announced today that the Federal Government had agreed to give the state an additional $200 million in Medicaid reimbursement for services provided by state psychiatric hospitals.
If all of that money is applied to the state's budget gap for the next fiscal year, the shortfall would shrink to $3 billion from $3.7 billion.
 
Disparity in Estimates
 The Democrats who control the Assembly said last week that they believe the state will collect $550 million in extra revenue. The Republicans, who hold a majority in the Senate, released a study on Monday putting the number at $749 million.
On paper, at least, the varying numbers can be attributed to the dismal science of econometrics, in which fractional differences in forecasts of gross domestic product and personal income growth can skew revenue estimates by hundreds of millions of dollars. But they also reflect the fiscal politics being played out in the Capitol among Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Weprin and Mr. Marino.
Mr. Cuomo, who is anticipating a tough re-election campaign in 1994, hopes to persuade voters that he used fiscal prudence to guide the state through a brutal recession. After having to borrow to avoid deficits at the end of four consecutive years, the state finally is running a surplus this year. Mr. Cuomo would like to showcase another surplus next year if he runs for re-election.
But legislators, almost by political definition, typically are more interested in providing services to constituents than in fiscal restraint.
The Assembly Democrats want more spending to soften some of the cuts Mr. Cuomo has proposed in social services and education programs. The Senate Republicans badly want to protect suburban schools from the $52 million reduction that Mr. Cuomo has proposed in education aid, to eliminate new taxes and fees, and to safeguard a dedicated transportation fund that Mr. Cuomo wants to raid.
 
Clear Political Opening
 But by embracing a revenue estimate that is higher than that projected by the Democrats, the Senate Republicans gave Mr. Cuomo a clear political opening that he is exploiting with relish.
"They might just as well have taken a wooden plaque with bronze letters on it that spell out 'I am a spender' and nail it to their foreheads," Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference on Monday.
Mr. Cuomo has cautioned against spending the new revenue recklessly. He maintains that only $202 million of the $501 million in new money can be considered recurring revenue, generated by a growing economy that the state can count on year after year.
 
Increase in Surplus
 The rest, he says, actually reflects an increase in the surplus for the 1992-93 fiscal year. Most of that tax revenue was generated by New Yorkers who received bonuses or took capital gains in late 1992 in anticipation of higher Federal tax rates in 1993.
Mr. Cuomo said today that the state should consider using some of the nonrecurring revenue as a reserve to cover losses incurred from the bombing of the World Trade Center and to pay anticipated judgments in a number of pending lawsuits.
He said his priorities for the recurring revenue would be to raise aid to education, minimize proposed cuts in Medicaid reimbursements for personal-care attendants, soften increases in a variety of fees and eliminate a tax on high-priced hotel rooms that may be driving tourism away from New York City.

HEADLINE: Defining the Suburban Borders of the Global Village;
A Fight for the Soul of Fairfield County Turns on What's on the Cable Television Dial

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
Are they Connecticut Yankees or displaced New Yorkers?
Consider Peter Justinius of Wilton, a 46-year-old antiques dealer and actor waiting here for his 8:06 A.M. train to Grand Central. "Without New York, Fairfield County is nothing," he said. "This is strictly a bedroom community." 
 Then ask Scott Cronin of Stamford, a 34-year-old restaurant manager who was taking the 8:51 north to New Haven. "I haven't been to New York City in six months," he said. "I could care less."
So goes the battle for the soul of lower Fairfield County, a long-running fight that erupted anew last month in a dispute over what television stations the county's residents will be able to watch on their cable system -- those from New York City or Connecticut.
 
Wealth and Prestige
 For decades, towns like Greenwich, Darien and Westport have been seen as paradigms of suburban wealth and prestige, all tied to the high-paying jobs of New York City. But many here say they are tired of being considered no more than a satellite of the nation's largest city. They also complain of being dismissed by legislators in Hartford, and residents elsewhere in Connecticut, as an island of wealth and big-city attitudes.
What Fairfield County wants, apparently, is an identity of its own. By many measures -- where they live, work, pay their taxes, shop and socialize -- people here are becoming less reliant on New York City.
"This is not an extension of New Yorks," said William Raveis, the owner of a large Fairfield County real-estate agency. "It's Connecticut. What was a quaint bedroom community 20 years ago has evolved into its own entity."
Those sentiments are not unique to Fairfield County. From Huntington, L.I., to Red Bank, N.J., the region's suburbs are growing less dependent on New York City for jobs, shopping and entertainment.
"There is a broad national pattern around every big city in which the urban cores have become much less important than they were 25 years ago, because jobs and people have moved out," said Kenneth Jackson, a professor of history at Columbia University and author of the 1985 book, "Crab Grass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States."
Nonetheless, he added, the links between New York City, Fairfield and the region's other suburbs are stronger than most.
"Manhattan is, as always, the country's most important downtown, and the suburbs will always be tied to it," he said. In the case of Fairfield County, he added, "an interdependent regional economy may be coming into conflict with Yankee independence."
What has sparked the current round of introspection in Fairfield County may come as a surprise -- cable television. In mid-February, the cable company serving the county, Cablevision Systems, said it planned to eliminate stations emanating from Hartford, Waterbury and New Haven, because much of their programming duplicated shows available on stations in New York.
Years ago, the announcement might not have caused a stir, because the airwaves of Fairfield County have always been bombarded by New York broadcasters. The county has no television station of its own, and long before the advent of cable and satellite dishes, Fairfield viewers simply turned their antennae south.
 
'Area of Dominant Influence'
 New York's dominance in Fairfield is demonstrated by market research. Since the inception of television, Fairfield and suburban counties stretching from eastern Long Island to south-central New Jersey, and the Pennsylvania border have been included by the broadcast industry in New York City's "Area of Dominant Influence."
The marketing concept is employed by advertisers and broadcasters to target their audiences and budgets. It is based on research by the Arbitron Company of Manhattan, which tracks how much time people across the nation spend watching television, and which stations they watch.
In its most recent report, for the year ending February 1992, Arbitron said it found that Fairfield County residents devoted 57 percent of their viewing hours to New York City stations, 22 percent to Connecticut stations and 19 percent to cable networks.
The New York City broadcasters' market share here, although dominant, was smaller than in most of the New York region. The same Arbitron report found that viewers in Westchester County, where there are few other options, spent 85 percent of their viewing time watching New York City Stations. The reaction to Cablevision Systems has been a firestorm of protest. Elected officials in Hartford said they would be cut off from their Fairfield constituents and many viewers said they already had too little access to Connecticut television news and were not about to see what remains of it disappear.
"More and more, Fairfield County has been identified with what is happening in the rest of Connecticut, and the news, sports and programming from our state is critical," said Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Attorney General, who lives in Stamford.
 
Petitioning State Regulators
 He has petitioned the State Department of Public Utilities Control to revoke Cablevision's franchise.
Last week the company offered a compromise: it would retain four of the five Connecticut stations it had planned to eliminate, but those stations must forgo payments they are entitled to under a new Federal law.
Analysts of Connecticut government say one reason for the intensity of the dispute is changes in state policy that have made the news from Hartford more important.
Chief among them is the imposition of a personal income tax in 1991. The tax was opposed most bitterly in Fairfield County, where many high-income New York City commuters had elected to live to avoid the income taxes of New York and New Jersey.
"Twenty years ago, you would have been right to say people in Fairfield focused on New York City and their own towns," said Harry Harris, vice president of the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association, a business group in lower Fairfield County. "Now, they are looking for more information about their state. The income tax has only increased their interest."
Fairfield County's new interest in the affairs of its own state is also being fueled by the recession, and a widespread conviction here that officials in Hartford have shortchanged the county in spending for roads, bridges and other public projects.
"There has always been plenty of money for highway construction around Hartford, but very little at this end of the state," said Jacquelyn Durrell, the First Selectman of Fairfield.
 
A Split Personality
 By some measures, Fairfield County's split personality shows no signs of changing. State studies of commutation patterns show that the economic lifeline to New York City is as strong as ever.
In its most recent study, the Connecticut Department of Transportation looked at changes in commutation between 1985, when the region was in an economic boom, and 1990, when it had sunk into recession. It found that the number of people commuting into New York City from most parts of Fairfield County had increased 11 percent, to 33,975.
The only declines were in the county's most affluent towns, and the state attributed the downturn to deep cuts in executive employment on Wall Street and among companies in Manhattan. New York-bound commuting was down 30 percent from Darien, 22 percent from Westport and 13 percent from New Canaan.
But workers living elsewhere in the county streamed into New York City in far higher numbers, the report said. Manhattan-bound commuting rose 245 percent from Bridgeport, 68 percent from Danbury and 43 percent from Stamford.
The study also found large increases in the number of people living in Fairfield County who commuted to jobs elsewhere in the county. Experts said those increases continued a trend of more than 20 years, since dozens of corporations moved their headquarters, research and development operations or marketing operations into the county, mainly from New York City.
 
Divided Allegiances
 As the commuting data suggest, the county's residents remain divided on their allegiances. Mr. Justinian, the Wilton actor and antiques dealer, said he moved with his wife from Boston to Wilton in 1985, and has since become so captivated by New York City that he visits Manhattan at every opportunity.
"I want everything I can get from the city -- the news included," he said. "Cut me off from New York and I don't know what I would do."
But to many others, such big city ties are loose, frayed or completely undone.
"This is much less of a bedroom suburb than it used to be," said Joe Andrews, owner of Peter's Old Mill Deli, across from Westport's expansive beach on Long Island Sound.
Mr. Andrews, whose customers often include writers, advertising executives, actors and others with a distinctly New York City orientation, says he has nonetheless avoided entering Manhattan for 30 years.
"I'm happy to be surrounded by a mix of people, including folks from New York," he said. "But this is Connecticut, and this is where I want my news."

HEADLINE: For Schwarzenegger, a Defusing

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Sensitive to the fact that New Yorkers are just a bit skittish about dynamite blockbusters these days, the producers of a new Arnold Schwarzenegger action film have defused a 75-foot-high balloon of their star that straddles the Armed Forces Recruiting Center in Times Square, replacing two sticks of dynamite in its left hand with a lawman's badge.
"There's not going to be explosives, there's going to be a badge," the chairman of Columbia Pictures, Mark Canton, said yesterday. "We want to make a strong statement about supporting the right people at this time. After all, Arnold's character is a hero." 
 The balloon, which serves as a promotional device for the movie but is also integral to the script, was erected on Monday afternoon but was deflated within hours amid concerns about the symbolism of the dynamite. With the dynamite replaced with a badge overnight, the balloon was reinflated yesterday, with a gun still in the right hand.
 
Small Consolation
 The defusing of the balloon may be small consolation to the estimated 12,000 drivers who have enough difficulty negotiating the crossroads of the world in a normal evening rush. But city officials believe that the filming of the movie "Last Action Hero" in Times Square over the next seven days is worth the inconvenience.
As Mayor David N. Dinkins said in a statement, "I believe this film project, which represents a return of the big-budget, major studio production to New York, is a turning point for the future of movie-making in our city." The Mayor conceded that there would be disruptions.
With production under way yesterday afternoon, Edwin Campos -- known as "Papa Smurf" to other bicycle messengers -- had to weave his way through backed-up, detoured cars. "Yeah, it's a bit uncomfortable," he said during an unscheduled stop, "but there is no traffic jam a good biker can't get through."
A spokesman for the city's Transportation Department, Joseph DePlasco, said all the Times Square street closings over the next seven days will be between 3 P.M. and 4 A.M. Today, 43d Street will be closed between Avenue of the Americas and Eighth Avenue, 44th Street will be closed between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, and Broadway will be closed between 45th and 43d Streets.
Tomorrow, Friday and Sunday, 42d Street will be closed between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. And on Monday and Tuesday, Seventh Avenue will be closed from 45th to 42d Streets, and 43d Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenues.
The official pleasure over production of a major movie in the city signals an end to a movie-making dry spell induced by an eight-month labor dispute in 1991 between the studios and film unions.
 
'New Economic Landscape'
 Pointing out that the unions eventually "gave back over 30 percent of their compensation package," the city's Commissioner of Film, Theaters and Broadcasting, Richard Brick, said yesterday that there was a "new economic landscape" for film makers in New York.
Mr. Brick pointed out that Columbia would spend in "excess of $3 million" during the film shooting. And Mr. Canton predicted that "if it goes well, which it will, it will be revitalizing to the film industry's potential for working in New York."
All well and good for the movie industry. But until they met with city officials last week, executives in the theater business were nonplussed at the prospect of streets blocked to ticketholders driving into the area.
"Specifically, we objected to the closure of 44th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue," said Gerald Schoenfeld, chariman of the Shubert Organization. In what Mr. Schoenfeld called "an amicable resolution," the city and Columbia agreed to keep that street open.
Not so fortunate yesterday was Ricardo Brooks, who sells used paperbacks on Seventh Avenue. To accommodate the movie crews, a police officer had ordered Mr. Brooks to pack his books, fold his table and move on. Wondering if a business opportunity wasn't presenting itself, Mr. Brooks said, "I wouldn't mind somebody paying me to leave."

HEADLINE: THE TWIN TOWERS: Disaster Relief;
Recovery Aid Is Offered, But Not All May Qualify

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
With 350 businesses displaced by the World Trade Center explosion, local government agencies are preparing to distribute disaster relief in the form of small business loans, but major questions remain over who will qualify for another, Federal program.
New York City and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said yesterday they had dedicated a total of $5 million to help businesses cover the costs of finding temporary quarters through loans of up to $50,000. Officials said that they intended to approve the applications within 24 hours and that those who applied yesterday would begin receiving checks today.
 
Program Restrictions
 But a larger, Federal program, administered by the Small Business Administration, appeared to exclude financing for many companies operating in relocated offices after the explosion. The program is intended to provide low-interest financing of up to $500,000 to help small companies pay their employees and cover their expenses during disasters when they cannot operate. 
 Officials said that interest among the World Trade Center tenants in both of the government loan programs was likely to grow, because of the new assessment that the center's twin towers will be closed for up to a month. Many tenants had expected to return to the towers next week.
A spokeswoman for the Small Business Administration, Denise Scarpinsky, said the Federal agency would hold an informational meeting about its program tonight, from 7 to 9, in the World Trade Center concourse.
 
Service Center Open
 The agency said its representatives would also operate a service center in the concourse to accept loan applications from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. on Thursday, Friday and Saturday this week, and from Monday through Saturday next week.
Ms. Scarpinsky said it was not known how many businesses would qualify because the Small Business Administration, while familiar with the demands of natural disasters, had little experience aiding victims of a disaster like Friday's bombing.
Retailers and others who have been forced to shut down in the World Trade Center complex and elsewhere in Manhattan because of the explosion are expected to qualify, she said, because they will experience shortfalls in meeting payroll and other expenses.
 
Some Disqualified
 But for companies that continued operating, Federal assistance appeared unlikely yesterday. Ms. Scarpinsky said guidelines for her agency's program of "economic injury disaster loans" would disqualify those who are seeking to offset the cost of renting alternative office, transferring employees to other cities or leasing equipment temporarily.
The Federal loan program is being offered because New York City and its suburbs were declared an economic injury disaster area by President Clinton, at the request of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, on Monday. Assistance programs from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which are routinely available to victims of floods, hurricanes and other natural disasters, have not been offered.
Information and loan applications for all of the government programs are being dispensed at the former Alexander's Department Store in the World Trade Center concourse. For the New York City and Port Authority program, a processing center was set up yesterday to receive applications in the World Trade Center concourse.
 
Secured by Deposits
 New York State and Port Authority officials said yesterday that 270 of the 350 displaced companies would qualify for their loan program as small or medium-size businesses. The loans carry 4 percent interest and must be repaid within a year.
Although money for the program has been provided by the city and the Port Authority, it is being administered by New York State. Vincent Tese, Governor Cuomo's chief economic adviser, said the displaced companies would qualify with almost no questions asked because their loans will be secured by security deposits the companies have already paid as World Trade Center tenants.
He said 12 companies applied for the loans yesterday, seeking a total of $220,000. The amount companies receive will depend on how much space they lease; large tenants can get up to $50,000, but smaller tenants will see less, based on their square footage.
One of the 12 companies that applied yesterday was World Trade Jeweler, a jewelry store that has operated for five years on the concourse level under Tower 2. Alan Shabot, the store's owner, said he applied for the maximum that he was allowed, but it amounted to only $20,000 because he leases only 1,000 square feet of retail space.
"I think they are doing a heck of a job," Mr. Shabot said, adding that he expects to pick up his $20,000 check today and use part of it to cover the salaries of employees who have been idle since the explosion.

For a Black Woman, Space Isn't the Final Frontier

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HANOVER, N.H.

 BODY:
As the first black woman to venture into outer space, Dr. Mae C. Jemison knows how it feels to boldly go where no one like herself has gone before.
The astronaut, who is also a medical doctor and a chemical engineer, has spent most of her 36 years entering arenas traditionally dominated by white men. 
 When people discouraged her, as they did from the time she was a kindergartner on Chicago's South Side to her collegiate days as a chemical engineering major at Stanford University, she ignored them.
"I never did believe there were these differences," Dr. Jemison said of racial and sexual stereotypes. "I always assumed I would go into space ever since I was a little girl. I would have applied to be an astronaut if there had never been a single person going into space."
That attitude is precisely what led Dartmouth College to invite Dr. Jemison to its Hanover campus, where she has been teaching a course on space-age technology and developing countries this term. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration granted her a leave of absence to accept a fellowship offer from Dartmouth and to live here and give lectures; it was her idea to teach the course.
"She has provided exactly what I was looking for," said Carol Muller, associate dean of the Thayer School of Engineering, who nominated Dr. Jemison for the fellowship. "I wanted someone who would be upbeat and inspirational who could acknowledge that there are barriers for women in science, but be a living example of not letting those stand in her way."
Whenever Dr. Jemison speaks to the college's 4,272 undergraduates about her experiences aboard the space shuttle Endeavour in September 1992 or about the need for all nations to participate in space exploration, her credo is clear: "Don't be limited by others' limited imaginations."
Although Dr. Jemison's main message to students is to believe in themselves, her presence on campus and in the classroom has served to underscore the importance of role models in undergraduate education, particularly for women and minorities interested in science and engineering.
Her class focuses on the potential use of satellite and telecommunications technology to improve health care in West Africa. As a medical officer for the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone and Liberia, Dr. Jemison was responsible for the corps's health-care delivery system in those countries.
Ms. Muller said Dr. Jemison's course had attracted more women and minorities than any other undergraduate course in engineering.
"Women usually make up about 25 percent of students in that building as opposed to half, and minorities are usually underrepresented in engineering," Ms. Muller said. Of the 29 students enrolled in the class, 13 are women and 12 are black. They include students majoring in fields as diverse as English, government and religion, as well as engineering.
Mark Harrison, a junior government major, said that he took the class primarily because he was interested in solving "real world" problems but that, as a black man, he was also intrigued by Dr. Jemison's accomplishments.
"There are few black doctors that you actually meet, and here's this black woman who is a doctor, an engineer and an astronaut," Mr. Harrison said. "It's inspiring to see that there aren't any fields where we are limited."
Despite many barriers having fallen, Dr. Jemison said people's image of scientists had failed to change. She recalled her kindergarten teacher's dismissive attitude when she told her she wanted to be a scientist. "You mean a nurse," Dr. Jemison recalled the teacher as saying.
Dr. Jemison said such responses would have to change if Americans wanted to be among the world's leaders in the next century. By the year 2000, less than 25 percent of the nation's high school seniors will be white males, she said, citing a 1987 report, "Workforce 2000," by the Hudson Institute, a research organization based in Indianapolis.
"If you don't want to be fair or ethical about it, there is a very crucial economic reason to encourage more women and minorities to pursue careers in the sciences," Dr. Jemison said. "I want to make sure we use all our talent, not just 25 percent."

HEADLINE: In Barrage of Ads, Stein Strives for Surge in Polls

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Stuck so far behind in early polls that he is fending off speculation that he may abandon the race, City Council President Andrew J. Stein is planning to open his bid for mayor with an extravagantly expensive media campaign that will bring the era of talk show politics to New York City.
The barrage of campaign commercials, Perot-style "infomercials" and audience participation specials -- which a Stein strategist said was likely to cost as much as $2.5 million over the next three to four months -- will coincide with the City Council President's formal announcement of his candidacy later this month. It promises to be one of the most expensive early openings to the New York mayoral race ever. 
 The city's political experts, who have been surprised by Mr. Stein's poor showing in public opinion polls, call the early media campaign a make-or-break move. Such tactics, they note, are usually employed by political unknowns striving to build a public image.
 
Confidence of a Year Ago
 Mr. Stein shrugs off his early problems, pointing to President Clinton as a model of how a candidate can come from behind. "In a way it's good it's sort of my turn for taking a lot of stuff in February," he said the other day, "because I'd rather have that in February than April or May or June."
Just a year ago, Mr. Stein, ever ambitious, but no longer the brash upstart of Manhattan politics, seemed near the pinnacle of his career, poised to challenge a struggling Mayor. He was so confident he talked of running on both the Democratic and Republican lines.
But after months as the presumptive challenger to Mayor David N. Dinkins, Mr. Stein has failed to pick up momentum. A number of early samplings of the public mood show Mr. Stein consistently running about 30 percentage points behind the Mayor among Democrats, hovering at about 20 percentage points to 50 percentage points for the Mayor.
Some potential supporters, including several who backed Mr. Dinkins in 1989, say cautiously that they are waiting to see if Mr. Stein can mount a credible candidacy. And while Mr. Stein has raised $4.7 million -- the most of any of the mayoral contenders -- his fund raising relies on a relatively narrow circle of rich business executives and longtime friends of his family. His parents gave him one-sixth of all the money he raised over the six months through January.
 
Vying for Liberal Nod
 Having made peace with Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former Federal prosecutor, has no challenger for the Republican nomination, although he and Mr. Stein are contenders for the Liberal endorsement.
In another blow to Mr. Stein, Herman Badillo, a former Bronx Borough President, has decided to enter the Democratic race. "Any anti-Dinkins vote that doesn't go to Andy, hurts Andy," said Norman Adler, a political consultant.
For months, politicians and consultants have speculated that Mr. Stein would drop out of the race. Now they say he might still withdraw if his media campaign does not produce results. But he insists that he is in the race to stay.
"I feel honestly that nobody is better prepared to be mayor than me," he said, so eager to show confidence that he hectors doubters. "You will see that we will be within six or seven or eight points by the middle of April. You can count on that."
The Stein campaign will borrow the talk-show tactics of the Presidential race, reaching out for viewers who warmed to Bill Clinton on the Arsenio Hall show, or called Ross Perot when he appeared with Larry King. Philip Friedman, Mr. Stein's campaign consultant, said 15-minute to 30-minute Perot-style "infomercials" were being planned, as well as audience participation specials and call-ins.
The television campaign will be supplemented by a book of prescriptions for the city's ills. The commercials are meant to reintroduce Mr. Stein and frame what he describes as crucial issues -- from crime to the economy to the need to reorganize city government -- in a way that will appeal to a target constituency.
Mr. Dinkins is expected to hold onto most of the black voters who make up about 30 percent of the Democratic primary electorate, and Mr. Stein is expected to do well among whites outside Manhattan. The swing groups are Hispanic voters and liberal whites, among them homosexuals, feminists and professionals.
 
'Needs a Second Chance'
 Mr. Stein, who is 48 years old, has been in the public eye for 25 years ever since he won an expensive East Side Assembly race, with financial help from his father, Jerry Finkelstein. He went on to become Manhattan Borough President and then City Council President, a job that is being renamed and diminished.
In the crucial last year, he has not worn well. A poll of 844 city voters conducted by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in February found that 48 percent of those polled had an unfavorable impression of Mr. Stein, up from 28 percent in September. "It shows that Stein needs a second chance to make a first impression," said Lee M. Miringoff, who directs the Marist poll.
Mr. Stein has ordered extensive polling and anaylsis in recent months. In the focus groups, some participants called him a rich kid manipulated by his father, or criticized his intelligence or toupees. "People have a slightly negative perspective and we find it in focus groups and polls," said one campaign aide, who spoke on condition that he not be identified.
But the findings have made the campaign take heart because the negative impressions are vague and personal and not tied to a stand on issues or performance in office. "You just see the whole shift in the dynamics when people hear me, they see me, they hear my views and they feel my personality," Mr. Stein said. "Basically, people just don't know."
He plans to speak about education, crime and the city's economy, issues that appeal to an array of interest groups. He will try to present himself as a Clinton-style untraditional Democrat with issues like privatization of city services, government reorganization and Civil Service reform.
Still, Mr. Stein will have the advantage of being the first well-financed contender to enter the mayoral race. In the six-month period that ended in January, Mr. Dinkins had raised about $3 million and Mr. Giuliani $2.25 million. Mr. Stein, alone among the three, has refused to abide by voluntary limits on contributions and spending and thus will not be eligible for matching public funds.
Although Roy Innis, president of the Congress of Racial Equality, announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination on Sunday, neither Mr. Dinkins nor Mr. Badillo have said when they would formally declare their candidacies.
For now, many of the people Mr. Stein cites as potential supporters are waiting to see whether he can get his campaign moving. "There's no question about the fact that he has nowhere to go except up," said City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, who said he expected to stay neutral in the Democratic primary.

HEADLINE: Layoffs and Factory Closings Shaking the Japanese Psyche

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 2

 BODY:
For years the popular mythology in Japan has been that plant closings and corporate layoffs were quintessentially American. Humane Japanese companies would rather accept losses than cast an employee into the street.
But throughout the country the dreaded phrase these days is "kata tataki," or "tap on the shoulder." Not only are industrial workers getting the tap, but even employees of the richest and seemingly most secure companies. 
 The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which during Japan's boom was by some measures the world's largest corporation, said it was eliminating 30,000 jobs over the next several years, and many other companies are hinting they are next. With the dam now broken, no one doubts that more cutbacks are on the way.
The problem has been coming to the surface for months, dribbling out in late-afternoon corporate announcements and in tales seeping from the vast, cluttered rooms where Japanese managers and engineers and secretaries wend their way among battleship-gray desks.
 
Turning Off the Lights
 A group of lawyers who set up a telephone hot line in Tokyo last month to field complaints from aggrieved workers discovered the lengths to which some companies were going to force out employees protected by Japan's much-admired "lifetime employment" system. Among the hundreds of callers was a 51-year-old manager of an audio equipment maker who said he had been relocated to a basement office and then given no work. When he did not get the hint, the company dimmed the lighting week by week. He finally quit.
 
From Software to Saws
 Then there was the 44-year-old computer software manager in Tokyo who told the lawyers that he was redeployed to a distant subsidiary in Ishikawa Prefecture and given a new title, "education director." His job, it turned out, was to supervise his fellow workers, who had been handed saws and told to begin cutting down trees. He is still at it.
If there was a single moment that seemed to shake the national psyche and mark the end of a chapter in the postwar era, it came at the end of the daytime shift a few days ago at the Nissan Motor Company's Zama plant, a symbol for 30 years of the Japanese economic miracle. That was when the plant manager made a surprise announcement over the loudspeakers that the huge assembly line would shut down over the next two years. The 2,500 assembly workers would have a clear choice -- move to other plants, some of them far away, or quit.
"For Japanese workers the closing of a plant is something completely alien," a senior auto executive said, asking not to be identified because the subject is something no one in his company will discuss, except behind closed doors. "It is something that happens in the U.S., or on the other side of the earth. And now they are finding themselves stunned. They are saying, 'My God, it is at my doorstep.' "
 
Bad for America?
 The result could be as bad for America as it is for Japan. The Clinton Administration, Japanese officials say, will face a far chillier reception than ever before if it assembles a list of trade demands. With things this bad, Japan's industrial planners contend, they have little chance of twisting concessions out of Japanese companies.
Even the programs to close the trade gap with the United States seem imperiled. In Osaka, the industrial heart of the country, a $1.1 billion trading center is rising from an artificial island in Osaka Bay. But it has become a symbol of the turn of fortunes because with retail sales down sharply almost no one is interested in stocking the products from the United States and other nations that will be displayed in nearly four million square feet of floor space.
"These are the first signs of more to come," said Sozaburo Okamatsu, the director general of the international trade bureau at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. "The bubble hid a lot of restructuring that was overdue."
 
Business Blames Government
 Business executives, in contrast, blame the Government, saying it ignored the signs for far too long, and then stepped in with an economic stimulus plan that was too late and paltry.
Government officials say that the announcements sound far worse than they really are, and point to unemployment numbers, around 2.3 percent of the work force, that have barely budged. But workers and unions say the numbers are an elaborate fiction: The first layoffs hit part-time workers, mostly women, who are not counted in the figures; the second wave is a forced-retirement program aimed at workers 45 to 55 years old. Most of them have held only one job their entire lives, and are not likely to start looking for new work now.
"We have had recessions before, and sometimes blue-collar workers have been forced out," said Yosuke Minaguchi, the leader of the lawyers' group. "But this time is different. These are the white-collar graduates of the best universities who have had unquestioned loyalty to their companies over the last two decades or so."
In a few cases, the outcry surrounding the ouster of longtime employees has forced companies to back off. The management of TDK, a maker of magnetic tapes and electronic parts, had to withdraw a plan to force out older employees. The same happened at Pioneer, which was taken aback by the publicity surrounding its decision to dismiss more than 30 managers.
Employees at the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the maker of Panasonic electronics, say the pressure to retire early or move to an affiliate company is on. At Matsushita, according to one employee, people are left with little more to do in a new job after getting the tap on the shoulder than stare out the window.
The latest kata tataki victim is Matsushita's president for the last seven years, Akio Tanii. What first appeared to be a voluntary resignation was later seen as a palace coup, engineered by the founding Matsushita family.
 
Bush Trip Recalled
 Such events have led some Japanese to say what some foreigners have argued for several years: In the "bubble" of the 1980's the Japanese got arrogant and lost their usually unerring sense for the fundamentals.
Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's largest newspapers, reminded readers that only 13 months ago the same auto makers that are twisting in the wind today had faced off against their American counterparts during President George Bush's trip to Japan. At the time, it noted, the companies "were not completely free from a sense of satisfaction for having climbed to the top of the world's automotive industry."
Similar humblings have come to normally conservative companies and banks that took wild risks in the stock and currency markets. The leadership of Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K., the Japanese subsidiary of Shell Oil, just resigned after revelations that management had lost $1 billion in bad currency trades. Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest daily, said in an editorial that companies had deluded themselves and "consequently lost sight of their main purpose."
The experience is shaking Japan in many ways, said Robert Orr, a professor at Temple University's campus here and a longtime student of Japanese politics. "The salary scales are heavily weighted toward people over 50. So when you force them out early, you give them far smaller retirement packages."
 
The Export Solution
 Japan has had downturns before, of course. But in the past, there was always a clear solution: export more. Politically, that is the one thing Japan cannot do now, not with a trade surplus that has soared to record levels with the world, and near-record levels with the United States.
The situation is only worsened by the recent strength of the yen, which makes exports all the more expensive. Theoretically, imports should be getting cheaper, but Japanese consumers have made it clear they are in no mood to buy.
The Government has been debating several strategies, including a tax cut. But the Ministry of Finance has opposed it, arguing that in their cautious mood, Japanese consumers would simply put the proceeds into a savings account. That would leave Japan with a significant budget deficit, and nothing to show for it.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Radio-Frequencies Bill Advances

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
The House of Representatives today approved a bill that would require the Federal Government to free a big block of radio frequencies for commercial technologies like wireless pocket telephones and palm-sized computers.
The measure sailed through by a vote of 410 to 5. A similar measure has been introduced in the Senate, but Congressional Democrats may still find themselves on a collision course with President Clinton over how the new frequencies are handed out. 
 In his package of economic proposals, the President called for auctions that would sell rights to the airwaves to the highest bidder. The Administration says that these auctions could produce $4 billion in revenues over the next five years and that market-like bidding would lead to more rational use of the radio spectrum.
But the bill's sponsor, Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, remains worried that auctions would cede control of a valuable and scarce public resource to big corporations with deep pockets.
The Government now awards licenses at no charge, either through luck-of-the-draw lotteries for services like cellular telephones and paging, or through long and complex comparative hearings for television and radio stations.
Both processes have been criticized by Democrats and Republicans as inefficient and as bonanzas for speculators who obtain licenses at no cost and resell them. Still, many lawmakers are hesitant to embrace auctions as the only alternative.
Debate over the idea of auctioning the airwaves has stalled the bill to free new areas of the spectrum, which is otherwise a popular piece of legislation.
 
Previous Stances
 The Bush Administration argued that no bill to reallocate frequencies should pass unless it authorized auctions. House Democrats sidestepped the issue, approving bills in 1990 and 1992 that were silent on the question. The Senate last year became bogged down over the question, with senators trying to craft a compromise that would authorize an experimental auction on a small block of frequencies.
The Administration entered the fray last week with a letter to Mr. Dingell that criticized the House bill for its silence on the auction question.
"This bill raises a number of substantial concerns," wrote Carol C. Darr, the Commerce Department's acting general counsel, who argued that auctions would bring a much-needed change to the current system.
The letter stated that auctions would encourage efficient use of the radio spectrum, because "assignments would be based on economic value to the user, as expressed by a willingness to pay." It also stated that auction revenues would help reduce the Federal budget deficit and that the auctions could be designed to give special consideration to entrepreneurs and nonprofit groups.
 
Some Shift Detected
 Mr. Dingell and his colleagues may be softening. In a letter last week, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, a co-sponsor of the bill with Mr. Dingell, said he was "committed to considering an auction proposal" that would protect the public interest.
But he also demanded that the Administration put forward a detailed proposal that would leave room for cash-short small businesses and prevent companies from abusing the process.

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW YORK;
Sociological Musings on Some Women's Search for Fellowship

BYLINE: By Michael T. Kaufman

 BODY:
IN this age of collapsing sexual stereotypes we are about to tread on dangerous ground, examining the rise and glory of Wowee, which stands for Women of the World Eating Everything. It was almost three years ago that Eve Bigelow and her old Harvard roommate, Lucy Dineen, decided that what they needed was a forum where women could meet regularly and talk about the world.
"Ever since college it seemed that our men friends had club lives, with eating clubs and sports teams," said Ms. Bigelow, a fund-raiser for the American Civil Liberties Union. She got the idea soon after she came to New York from Egypt, where she had tried to teach poor farmers to raise rabbits. "We felt we needed something of our own." 
 At the first meeting, in August 1990, the six women who showed up decided to recruit women to attend monthly gatherings to be organized around some country or geographical area. A book might be assigned as a focal point for discussions and members would prepare and share foods associated with whatever region was chosen. They decided to call themselves "Cold Soup, Hot Ideas," but that very quickly gave way to Wowee.
The idea blossomed. By now there have been close to 30 meetings and more than 35 women, mostly in their late 20's and early 30's, have become involved. Last year when Ms. Dineen moved to Boston, she opened a chapter there and it is also thriving.
Just how comfortable the Wowee women have grown with the format and with each other was made clear at a regular monthly meeting last week.
This time the subject was Cuba. The assigned reading was "The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love." The 15 women who showed up brought many variations on rice and beans. There were also Cuban cigars for after dinner. Afro-Cuban jazz came from the CD player.
After chatting on matters personal and professional, the women gathered in a circle and began talking about the book, about Cuba. Were the macho qualities of the musicians in the book culturally accurate? What would happen when Castro eventually left the scene? Would Cubans stream here in greater numbers than the Haitians? Should they be welcomed even when they were no longer fleeing Communism? How did Cuba intend to encourage tourism while trying to keep its citizens away from the visitors?
It was good conversation but for this interloper the most striking thing was not the talk so much as the women themselves and the quality of their relationship. No one was scoring points, no one was embarrassed about not knowing something or about saying something that proved wrong or mistaken. The women, who included a graphic designer, several business executives, an economist who finds investment capital for third world women, two television producers and one assistant district attorney, were the kind of caring achievers featured in ads for The Gap.
Not to mince words, they were world-class humans. Yet their gathering was not so much sophisticated as homey, more like a quilting bee than a cocktail party, an assembly of friends, rather than of networkers or competitors.
And now -- and here is the pardoxical part -- this quality has gained Wowee the respect and even envy of the very clubby men whose own socializing had first inspired Ms. Bigelow. In a tongue-in-cheek but nonetheless admiring gesture, the men, among them husbands, boyfriends, former boyfriends and just friends of the Wowee women, have organized MEAT, which stands for Men Eating American Things. What they do is to try to get together to eat steak, drink beer and talk sports.
One of the main MEAT organizers, John Solomon, said that he had become fascinated with Wowee. "They were ready to read books just to talk with each other, they cared enough to cook for each other," said Mr. Solomon, who works as a program planner for Lifetime, a cable network that specializes in women's programming. "They really worked at their social life, really took pains for it. Would men do that? I don't think so. In fact the only time I see my men friends on any regular basis is at a weekly basketball game."
MEAT's first meeting was held at a steakhouse. There was also a summer cookout that was not badly attended. No books were discussed. Since then other meetings were considered but never materialized because nobody got around to calling anybody.
In January, a breakthrough was attempted, as MEAT and Wowee tried to hold a joint meeting on Vietnam at Ms. Bigelow's apartment. It turned out that the men were outnumbered 18 to 5 because the MEAT man in charge of invitations stumbled. The few who came brought no food, just beer, and had not done the reading. Ms. Bigelow's husband, John Baxley, said he thought it was a great idea but he had to leave to play a gig with his band, Foggy Notion.
What's this prove? Maybe just that women don't need to keep score as much as men do.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off as Outlook Dims For Lower German Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled lower on world currency markets yesterday as prospects dimmed for lower interest rates in Germany.
Gold prices rose worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $329.80 a troy ounce, up $1.20 from Monday. The Republic National Bank said gold added $1.05 an ounce, to a late bid price of $329.40. 
 Dealers said the currency market had been full of anticipation that the Bundesbank would lower interest rates at a meeting scheduled for tomorrow. But the latest indications from the central bank are that rates will remain unchanged, at least in the near term.
Demand for the dollar was "muted largely after the speculators gave up on the Bundesbank easing rates," said Raja Ramachandran, an analyst with Technical Data in Boston.
James Maccario, chief dealer at the Bank of Boston, said there was virtually no reaction to a Commerce Department report showing the Government's chief economic forecasting gauge inched up a tenth of a percent in January. A separate report showed new-home sales plunged 13.8 percent in the same month, the biggest drop in 11 years.
"People aren't worried," Mr. Maccario said of the home sales figures. "It was an aberration" that may have resulted from bad weather, he said. Mortgage rates, which are at the lowest level in decades, are expected to spur buying in coming months.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 118.50 yen, up 0.07 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 117.73 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 117.73 yen, from 118.70 yen on Monday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.4480, up from $1.4389 late Monday. In New York it cost $1.4485 to buy one pound, more expensive than Monday's $1.4385.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.6400 German marks, down from 1.6545; 1.5225 Swiss francs, down from 1.5375; 5.5640 French francs, down from 5.6116; 1,562.00 Italian lire, down from 1,571.00, and 1.2468 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2491.

No Letup in New Municipal Issues

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The tax-exempt municipal market withstood another rush of new issues yesterday, with prices showing little change.
About $2 billion of new bonds were sold yesterday as the pace of sales seemed to show little slack after new issues set a record of $16.37 billion in February. That record total, however, barely surpassed the $16.04 billion set in February of last year, according to the Securities Data Company. 
 Donald Carey, director of municipal financial products at the First Boston Corporation, said the aggressive pricing of a $131.2 million issue by the Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York set the tone for a good day in the market. The issue, whose lead underwriter was Goldman, Sachs & Company, was oversubscribed, which allowed the price to be raised and the yield cut by 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
Tax-exempt bonds issued by New York State, New York City and other issuers in the state have been in demand recently because of their triple-tax-exempt status and the threat of higher Federal income tax rates.
Mr. Carey said the demand for municipal bonds was still being driven by the threat of higher tax rates. At the 36 percent top rate that President Clinton has proposed, a tax-exempt yield of 5 percent is equivalent to a taxable yield of 7.81 percent. And the yield would be 8.28 percent if a 10 percent surtax was added for taxable incomes exceeding $250,000 a year, bringing the effective top rate to 39.6 percent.
At the current top tax rate of 31 percent, the taxable equivalent yield of a 5 percent bond is 7.25 percent.
Mr. Carey also said that the higher-interest-rate bonds issued in the early 1980's were being paid off and that cash coming into the market would continue to give municipal bond prices support for some months to come.
Today, the market will be faced with an unusual new issue -- a $1.1 billion sale of bonds to pay for the design and building of a toll road in Orange County, Calif., by the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency, underwritten by First Boston. The principal and interest on the bonds will be paid off by the tolls from the road. The $2 initial toll will be one of the highest in the nation.
In the Municipal Assistance Corporation issue, the tax-exempt yields range from 2.50 percent for a bond due in 1994 to 4.10 percent in 1998, 4.80 percent in 2003 and 5.30 percent in 2008. For investors in the 31 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent yield would be about 3.62 percent for a bond due in 1994, 5.94 percent in 1998, 5.94 percent in 1998, 6.96 percent in 2003 and 7.68 percent in 2008. In the 36 percent tax bracket, the yields would be 3.91 percent, 6.41 percent, 7.50 percent and 8.28 percent, respectively.
 
Treasury Market
 Treasury prices were little changed yesterday. Traders said that after the rally on Monday brought the yield on bonds and notes back near their recent lows, investors and traders might settle into trading within a range until the February employment data are released Friday.
In the secondary market, the price of the 7.125 percent 30-year bond was up 2/32 , to 10322/32 , to yield 6.83 percent, down from 6.84 percent Monday. The 16-year low, reached a week ago Tuesday, was 6.82 percent.
The Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Corporation, a leading brokerage firm in the bond market, was still out of service yesterday because of the explosion at the World Trade Center on Friday. The firm matches buy and sell orders and is an important source of bond price data.
Since the explosion, the firm has been scrambling to find alternative office space. Dow Jones & Company, which distributes Cantor's price information to the market through its Tele-rate service, provided some space. And Salomon Brothers gave Cantor the space to build a temporary trading floor that is expected to be finished today.
Robert M. Mercorella, a managing director of Cantor, said yesterday, "We are hopeful that by tomorrow we are back in operation in government securities."

HEADLINE: C.D.'s and Money Market Accounts Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The average yields offered by banks on money market accounts and certificates of deposit for the week beginning today are down modestly compared with those offered the previous week, particularly among accounts with the shortest maturities and those at commercial banks.
According to The Bank Rate Monitor, the average yield on a six-month C.D. in the New York area has fallen a little less than the average decline for the same maturity at 20 big banks nationwide. The average decline for a New York money market account is also less than the decline at the 20 banks nationwide. 
 Average discount rates were mixed at the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills this week, with the three-month bill up and the six-month bill down. The auction is widely regarded as a harbinger of rate changes at banks.
The average rate at auction on Monday for a three-month Treasury bill was 2.97 percent, up a basis point, and the six-month bill was 3.05 percent, down a basis point. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
According to The Bank Rate Monitor's latest survey, the average New York-area money market account is down about 2 basis points, to 2.60 percent. Certificates of deposit are also down an average of 2 basis points, with a three-month C.D. yielding 2.71 percent and a six-month C.D. at 2.91 percent.
For the second consecutive week, the Chase Manhattan Bank is among the New York banks posting the sharpest change. Its money market account yield is 16 basis points lower at 2.17 percent.
Midlantic Banks, based in Newark, has lowered the yield on its three-month certificate of deposit 15 basis points, to 2.60 percent, while Carteret Federal Savings, based in Morristown, N.J., cut 10 basis points from the yield on its six-month certificate, to 3.15 percent.
Outside the New York market, yields at 20 large banks are down, with the average yield on a money market account falling 4 basis points, to 2.58 percent, and a six-month C.D. declining 2 basis points, to 2.94 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, March 3, 1993. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimum vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

Philadelphia's new convention center draws hotel chains' interest.

BYLINE: By David J. Wallace

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
HOTEL operators have been maneuvering for position in downtown Philadelphia in recent months in anticipation of the opening of a new convention center this summer.
Several hotel companies new to the city are examining opportunities in a market generally considered underserved, and renovation programs are in progress at two big downtown properties. 
 On Feb. 23, Holiday Inn Worldwide announced a $9.5 million rehabilitation of the city's third-largest downtown hotel, the Holiday Inn-Center City, at 18th and Market Streets, which it bought from VMS Realty. The company also brought in a new general manager to run the 445-room operation, which is the company's third hotel in downtown Philadelphia.
Only three blocks away, a $10 million renovation is under way at a property owned by Bell Atlantic Properties Inc. The former 288-room Radisson Hotel at 18th Street and the Ben Franklin Parkway will reopen in mid-April under the Embassy Suites flag.
"We just feel Philadelphia is a strategic market for our company," said John Tarantini, Northeast regional vice president for Holiday Inn Worldwide. "It's in a strategic corporate market that's undergoing tremendous growth."
Both properties are situated amid the city's busiest downtown business district and only a 15-minute walk from the new Pennsylvania Convention Center. The new center, with 432,000 square feet of exhibition space, will open in phases beginning in July and will be followed in early 1995 by the city's largest hotel, a new 1,200-room Marriott hotel.
The convention center stretches from 10th to 12th Street, between Arch and Race Streets near the Reading Terminal Market. Its opening will cause the city's hotel tax to rise from 5 percent to 6 percent in July, as the city repays its portion of the $500 million price. The Marriott is under construction on Market Street between 12th and 13th Streets.
Nevertheless, 3,000 additional hotel rooms are needed downtown in the next 10 years for Philadelphia to reach its potential as a convention destination, according to a report last month by the Philadelphia City Planning Commission. With only 7,000 rooms, the central business district has among the lowest number of hotel rooms of any big city in the nation.
Many of the city's newest hotels are also the most expensive. Luxury hotels like the Ritz-Carlton, the Rittenhouse and the Hotel Atop the Bellevue, which were opened in the last few years, charge as much as $200 a night.
Peter Tyson of Peter R. Tyson & Associates, a hospitality consultant in Kennett Square, Pa., said the timing of new construction depended on the convention center. More than two million hotel-room nights have been booked for the center's commitments through 2002. The largest customer is a 1997 national meeting of the Lions Club International, estimated to use 9,000 rooms.
Mr. Tyson emphasized the crucial role played by the center. "Even the finest companies -- the Hyatts, Westins, Marriotts -- are finding it impossible to get traditional financing for acquisitions, let alone new construction, in a city that does not have a proven track record as a convention center," he said. "Many of these companies find it more palatable to gain entry by coming into a market by taking over franchisers and without diluting the market by adding more rooms."
Speculation has been widespread over whether the Hyatt Corporation, Westin Inc. or other companies that have no hotels here will enter Philadelphia. Many have been here before, when the city was a big convention destination even without a designated convention center, Mr. Tyson said. Several large hotels were torn down or converted to other uses, removing thousands of rooms from the city's inventory.
One of the city's most popular hotels has been a Comfort Inn about two miles from downtown near the rapidly developing waterfront. So new hotel construction need not be in the central business core, Mr. Tyson said.
In 1991, Philadelphia had 24 million visitors, divided evenly between business and leisure travelers, the planning commission report said. But hotel occupancy rates have been below the 65 to 75 percent break-even point of most properties. The city's rate was 60 percent in 1991 and 63 percent last year. And average room prices have declined. A study by PKF Consulting Inc., which specializes in the hotel industry, found that the average daily room rate peaked in 1990 at $91.75 a day but dropped to $88.50 last year.
Occupancy is expected to reach almost 90 percent for the short term until the Marriott opens, a change that could make up for three lean years, said John Indrieri, general manager of the Four Seasons Hotel-Philadelphia and president of the Greater Philadelphia Hotel Association.
"You can't just bank on conventions," Mr. Indrieri said. "We've got small companies that generate 3,000 or 4,000 room nights each year. The question is whether there's a long-term need. I expect to see another 800 or 1,000 rooms, but when it comes is critical."

HEADLINE: Good Choice for Hemisphere Job

 BODY:
After a false start, the Clinton Administration has come up with a sound nominee to be Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs. Alexander Watson is a seasoned career diplomat who served as U.S. Ambassador to Peru and most recently as Deputy Chief of Mission at the United Nations. As important, putting him forward means the Senate confirmation hearings will not be dominated by snarling exchanges about Fidel Castro and the future of post-Castro Cuba.
To avoid that prospect, the Clinton team backed away from a Cuban-American it had initially considered for the same vital post. Mario Baeza, a Wall Street lawyer who specializes in privatizing state-owned enterprises, was denounced as soft on Mr. Castro by Cuban-American hard-liners in Miami. Mr. Baeza's critics never gave him the courtesy of a hearing, pointing up the deep emotions stirred among Cuban-Americans in Miami and elsewhere. 
 Cuba is but one of a dozen countries that contend for Washington's attention. Huge Brazil is beset by a collapsing economy and corruption scandals that brought down its President. Democratic Venezuela has been rattled by attempted coups. A peace accord in El Salvador might come unstuck if its Government fails to purge the armed forces. Nicaragua's freely elected President, Violeta Chamorro, is challenged on every side, including former contras. Peru under an erratic President is still besieged by Shining Path guerrillas, Colombia by drug lords, and so forth.
In Havana, a failing tyranny stumbles toward history's dustbin. Fidel Castro could hardly have sounded wearier in his remarks to the foreign press last week: "This has been a very long race -- too long. . . . I feel I am a slave to the revolution." Since seizing power in 1959, he has tormented eight U.S. Presidents. Now with the collapse of Communism, Cuba has lost its arms suppliers, its trading partners and its ideological bearings.
The safest, wisest course for Washington is to let Cuba fester, and shun actions that could be construed as treating the island as booty to be devoured by emigres hungry for old privileges. The cool, professional eye of an Alexander Watson offers the promise of keeping Cuba, and the rest of the hemisphere, in maturer perspective.

HEADLINE: Twilight in Italy

 BODY:
Almost every day, new disclosures link Italy's political and business leaders to a vast web of organized corruption. Inflated public contracts awarded in exchange for kickbacks have cost Italy's taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. The scale of wrongdoing has outraged even the famously cynical Italian public, feeding demands for fundamental changes in the cozy arrangements by which Italy has been run for more than four decades.
Those changes could begin as soon as next month, when a referendum will be held on changing the proportional representation system for parliamentary elections. The idea is to encourage something like alternating two-party government in place of the permanent coalition rule that has virtually invited financial backscratching. 
 In the past, drastic change might have alarmed Washington. The coalition formula was devised, with American encouragement, largely to exclude Italy's Communist Party, the largest in the West, from a governmental role. But the days of American meddling in another democracy's politics are, mercifully, over. With the Communists, now renamed, in confused retreat, non-Communist Italians no longer have any reason to feel inhibited about cleansing and democratizing an inbred and dysfunctional political system. Paradoxically, Communism's collapse may have opened the door to genuine political revolution.
The upheaval began a year ago when investigators uncovered a kickback scandal in Socialist-run Milan. Revelations of political corruption quickly multiplied, embracing Socialist leaders in other cities of the industrial north. The scandal then swept up leading Christian Democrats, many rooted in the rural south and some reputedly tied to the Sicilian Mafia.
These two parties make up the core of the coalition that has long dominated the Government. Smaller coalition parties have also been trapped by the scandal, along with business leaders for whom kickbacks became the key to winning government business in an economy half-owned by the state.
The political beneficiaries of the scandal so far are regional parties, like the northern Lombard League, and the southern anti-Mafia Network Party. Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, a Socialist, is trying to hold the line with electoral reforms and accelerated privatization. But increasingly, Italy's postwar system seems headed into the political twilight. Americans can hope that a more democratic dawn is near.

HEADLINE: Economy Grows, Food Stamps Rise

 BODY:
What's with the United States economy?
It grew at a 5 percent clip at the end of last year. But an unusually large number of the unemployed have been permanently laid off and have no job to reclaim as the economy recovers. Consumer confidence is high. But the number of people collecting food stamps -- 26.6 million, more than 10 percent of the population -- has reached record numbers. 
 A safe conclusion is that the economy continues to recover, but too slowly to bring down unemployment much. That's why President Clinton's call for a short-term stimulus package still makes sense.
Growth during the last three months of 1992 was fast-paced. But judging from data released during the last week, the economy slacked off after December. Adjusted for inflation, consumer spending -- the usual engine of recovery -- fell in January; so did construction and home sales. And the Government's chief forecasting index rose just one-tenth of 1 percent in January.
Persistent unemployment explains why food stamp use has risen to an all-time high. The two million workers who have been unemployed for more than half a year are exhausting their life savings, thereby becoming eligible for food stamps.
Critics of the President's plan, not all of them Republicans, say Mr. Clinton should junk his stimulus program because it's unnecessary and delays cutting the deficit. Their case is unpersuasive. The President's $30 billion package is too small to harm the economy even if it picks up steam on its own.
Indeed, Mr. Clinton could easily justify a package at least twice as large as the one he actually proposed. But at least he's heading in the right direction. The stimulus will offset some of the recessionary impact of the tax hikes and spending cuts he proposes to cut the long-term deficit.
There's another reason to support Mr. Clinton's stimulus package. For the most part, the components are designed to spur long-term growth. The money would be spent on mass transit, education of poor children, childhood immunizations, youth training, environmental research and other worthy projects. Mr. Clinton decided to accelerate spending on the projects just in case the economy needed an extra nudge this year and next. Based on confusing data, that's a wise insurance policy.

HEADLINE: Perot Continues His Campaign, On Capitol Hill

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
Mr. Perot came to Washington today, trailed by a throng of cheering, laughing, applauding acolytes, to give Congress the road-tested message that when you get right down to it, the Government's problems are all very simple. It bore all the earmarks of a Frank Capra movie until one lawmaker began suggesting that he was long on pomp and arrogance, and short on solutions.
At that point, the set piece about the common man who takes the political kingpins down a notch got twisted inside out, and Ross Perot's true role as the potent vote-getter who commanded a fifth of the support in the Presidential election became apparent. 
 The Texas billionaire alternately bristled with indignation when his wisdom was challenged and apologized meekly when confronted with misstatements or stretches in the truth.
 
Addressing Congressional Panel
 Mr. Perot came to Capitol Hill largely at his own instigation, to advise a joint House and Senate panel drafting a plan to streamline Congress. The appearance was the latest event in a recent string of pep rallies, speeches, talk-show appearances, interviews with reporters, mass mailings and, soon, television specials intended largely to promote his citizen organization, United We Stand, America.
Mr. Perot repeated that ritual today, pounding away at the evil of the trillions in Government debt, warning that citizens "feel that our Government and some of our Government officials are for sale," and demanding that Congress shrink itself and the rest of the bureaucracy substantially, in the style of General Motors and Sears.
If it demurs, he hinted, his new citizen's group will hold it to account. "I urge you, on behalf of millions of ordinary people who are out there earning a living: stand on principle," he said. "Don't compromise. You will have their support. I can guarantee you. I can deliver if I have to."
Noting that Americans "want details, not sound bites," Mr. Perot spoke for close to an hour. But little of his lecture dealt in any detail with the problems of Congress. To the contrary, he repeated his diagnosis of the nation's ills, starting with deficit-cutting and moving to condemnations of lobbyists, bloated campaign budgets, rapacious foreign competitors and their lobbyists and, not the least, President Clinton's first month in office.
 
Criticism of White House
 His off-the-cuff testimony was peppered with barbs aimed at Mr. Clinton, softened every so often, and ever so slightly, by observations that the new President must be getting bad advice or has been too busy to learn the truth about Government.
Mr. Perot scoffed at the assertion that the Clinton White House had been cut by 25 percent, saying someone gave the President "phony numbers" that did not note that the personnel budget had shrunk by only 5 percent. He attacked Mr. Clinton's plan for a $30 billion economic stimulus, saying that "the average citizen has figured out that if $4 trillion" in deficit spending "didn't jump-start our economy, additional Federal expenditures of some magnitude being considered now are not the answer."
He criticized Mr. Clinton's depiction of increased taxes on Social Security benefits as a budgetary expense, blasting "the strange language of Washington" and concluding: "Let's call a dog a dog and an elephant an elephant." And he poked light fun at the President's advisers, saying he had "begged" Mr. Clinton to put businessmen in control without success. At one point, he described the Government's energy-policy strategists as "poets, philosophers and beekeepers."
"Not one of them has ever run a business or created a job, far as I know," Mr. Perot said of Mr. Clinton's top staff.
For one listener, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, that apparently did it.
"Ross, I like you a lot," Mr. Reid said, peering down at the witness. But he added, "you gave us 45 minutes of sound bites and 5 minutes of details.
"These statements, they're just not factual. 'The President doesn't have anybody to create jobs.' I don't know who works for him, but I know I've met his chief of staff, who's from corporate America just like you are. I bet he's created a lot of jobs."
Mr. Reid was referring to Thomas F. McLarty 3d, Mr. Clinton's oldest friend and a former chief executive of Arkla, a vast utility holding company.
The Senator then sharply dressed down Mr. Perot for what he said were other misstatements, about the nature of the 1990 agreement that capped Federal spending levels and the reasons for an increased deficit since then.
 
Bolstered by Applause
 "You've been giving a lot of advice here today to us," he said. "And again, I tell you I listen to a lot of advice you give. But let me give you a little advice: I think you should start checking your facts a little more, and stop listening to the applause so much."
Flustered and angry-looking, Mr. Perot challenged Mr. Reid to pin down his misstatements, asserting at one point that Mr. McLarty's business tenure at Arkla was marked by "problems," and telling Mr. Reid bluntly at one point: "You're ducking my question."
Bolstered by applause from the crowd, he eventually forced the Senator to concede that one basic argument about the fuzziness of Federal budget figures was correct.
But other Senators chimed in, more gently, in Mr. McLarty's defense. Senator David Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat, said Mr. McLarty had created thousands of jobs, and Senator David L. Boren, the Oklahoma Democrat who heads the streamlining panel, echoed that view. So Mr. Perot backed down.
"He is a fine man," Mr. Perot said. "I regret that anything came up where people felt they had to fall on their swords to defend him."
Representative Lee Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who is co-chairman of the panel with Mr. Boren, said later that Mr. Perot's testimony, however barbed and unspecific, was helpful.
"If you look at most of the testimony we've had so far in this committee, it's mostly technical," he said. "So it's good to get the perspective of a non-expert."
Later, appearing on CNN's "Larry King Live," Mr. Perot was more direct about how he expected Congress to reform itself. He called for lawmakers to surrender use of private gymnasiums in House and Senate office complexes, to give up cut-rate haircuts and lunches, to abolish preferred parking spaces in Washington garages and at Washington National Airport, and to forswear all junkets and other trips by lawmakers and their staffs.
"Once they think it through, they will realize it's not right," he said. "People patching holes in the street provide tax money for that -- and that's not right."
Mr. Perot also said he had talked to President Clinton about other reforms, but declined to discuss the conversations, saying that was the President's prerogative. Asked whether he would answer a call by Mr. Clinton to aid the Administration's own version of Federal reform, Mr. Perot first wavered, then seemed to rule it out.
"On too many occasions, our Government has just wanted to use me as, I call it, a poster boy, for show; I don't want that," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 4, 1993, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Ross Perot's appearance before a Congressional committee misstated a measure of Government deficit spending in some editions. What totals $4 trillion is the accumulated Federal debt; the Federal budget deficit is the difference between receipts and outlays in one year.

HEADLINE: THE TWIN TOWERS;
OPENING OF TOWERS UNLIKELY TO OCCUR UNTIL NEXT MONTH

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS

 BODY:
Port Authority officials yesterday all but abandoned their hopes of a quick reopening of the twin towers of the World Trade Center, saying the buildings, damaged in a powerful explosion on Friday, may now have to remain closed for a month.
The revised estimate comes as officials have gained a greater understanding in recent days of the length of time it will take to complete the painstaking task, step by step, of shoring up foundations, repairing other structural damage and restoring emergency power and fire control systems. 
 The presence at the site of investigators, who must compete with repair crews for access to the most severely damaged areas of the bombed-out underground parking garage, is also slowing the repair work, officials said.
 
Length of Exile
 An extended shutdown would intensify the housing and financial problems for the 350 banks, brokerage houses, law firms and other tenants of the World Trade Center that have been displaced by the bombing, and it could aggravate the impact on the Port Authority itself.
Representatives of government agencies and companies with offices in the World Trade Center said the problems for their businesses would escalate as the length of the exile grew.
As other companies began to make plans for a prolonged exile from the buildings, Federal agents continued to sift through the rubble for clues and stepped up surveillance of suspected terrorists. But they gave no indication that they were close to solving the case. [Page B7.]
 
Overly Optimistic
 At a news conference in Manhattan, Stanley Brezenoff, the executive director of the agency, acknowledged that the Port Authority's initial estimate that the reopening of the buildings could happen "in excess of" a week had been overly optimistic.
"It does appear that 'excess' was a bit of an understatement," he said. "I'd like to believe we can do it in less than a month."
City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, in a report released yesterday, said that companies and government agencies stood to lose an estimated $692 million if the World Trade Center were to be closed for just a week, and that the figure could increase to $1.07 billion if the buildings were to remain shut for a month.
Most of the losses, the report said, would be in the costs of lost business, repairs and relocation. The report said the daily costs would begin to decline as companies adjusted to their new situations, and that some of the losses would be made up by insurance claims. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has about $1 billion in property and liability insurance on the World Trade Center, the Comptroller said, which would more than cover the $20 million it would lose in monthly rental charges.
But the economic impact on the city as a whole may be less severe. Bruce Steinberg, a New York City economist, said that there was currently a surplus of office space in New York, and that most displaced tenants would be able to find alternative quarters quickly. The most significant impact may come, he said, from tenants who decide to relocate outside the city. Other city industries, such as tourism, appear not to have been seriously affected by the bombing.
Asked if tenants might decide to move out permanently when faced with a month's dislocation, Peter Yerkes, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said, "In terms of looking ahead to what might happen in a month, it's hypothetical." He stressed that the Port Authority was trying to help tenants find alternate space, offering them interest-free loans for expenses like security deposits, and helping them get access to computers and vital records.
Some executives were clearly worried. Alfred A. DelliBovi, president and chief economic officer of the of New York, said that the bank's paper records were still in the building, and were vital to its daily business.
"If the delay is more than two weeks it will be a severe disruption and very expensive," Mr. DelliBovi said. He added that about 50 of the bank's 100 employees had been moved to an office building in Piscataway, N.J., and some were commuting from as far away as Long Island.
 
$100,000 Reward
 At City Hall, Mayor David N. Dinkins announced a $100,000 reward -- the largest municipally financed reward in the city's history -- for information leading to the capture and conviction of those responsible for the bombing. Later in the day, Port Authority officials said they would match the city's offer.
"Those responsible will be caught, and, we promise, punished severely," the Mayor said. "That is a priority of this Mayor, this City Council and this City government."
One of the two trade center workers who had been reported missing turned up safe yesterday. King McGee, 55 years old, of Manhattan appeared at his company's temporary offices, the police said. Mr. McGee had been reported missing on Monday by his son, said Officer Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman.
But tensions remained high inside areas of the World Trade Center that have been reopened, and the police reported hundreds of bomb threats.
In an apparently unrelated case, the Nassau County, L.I., police arrested a 28-year-old man whom they said had called the New York City police earlier in the day, claiming a bomb would go off in the World Trade Center. Officer Peter Lambert, a spokesman for the Nassau police, said that the man, Kerry O'Brien of Franklin Square, claimed that he had phoned the threat to call attention to the world AIDS crisis.
 
Acess to Bomb Crater
 Port Authority officials explained yesterday that the reopening of the towers would take much longer than anticipated because the repair work must be done in a process that requires one task to be all but finished before the next can begin. For instance, investigators must gain access to the bomb crater before smashed conduits and pipes can be fixed, officials said. And the repair of those structures must be under way before repair crews can get to work on fixing the smoke detection systems and backup power supplies.
Law-enforcement officials say it will be the weekend, at the earliest, before the damaged structure of the parking garage has been sufficiently strengthened to permit crews to reach the center of the bomb crater, considered an essential element of the investigation.
Because many of the safety and support systems are common to the two towers, officials said that it is likely the reopenings of the buildings would come in quick succession. However, the reopening of Tower 2, where the smoke damage was less severe, would probably precede the opening of Tower 1 by some short period of time, they said.
Some with offices in the World Trade Center, who have by necessity been forced to innovate again and again in the aftermath of the bombing, said they would try to cope with the latest setback to their attempts to restore business as usual.
"I'm not surprised by the longer delay, because I didn't see how it was possible to install all of the safety features in one week," said Don C. Becker, the publisher and president of the Journal of Commerce, a financial newspaper that moved its editorial employees to the offices of its parent company. "We are not badly off because our printing plant and composing room are in New Jersey. If the delay is more than a month, we'll be like the relatives who came for a week and stayed for a year."
Over all, the insurers with potentially the largest liabilty for claims arising from the disaster are syndicates associated with Lloyd's of London and London-based insurance companies, said Barry Weintraub, the chief financial officer for the World Trade Center. All together they could be responsible for $300 million in liability, property and business interruption claims, he said.
Lloyd's syndicates and London-based companies are responsible for the first $100 million in liability claims, said Mr. Weintraub. After that insurance shifts to a consortium of domestic insurers and two Bermuda-based companies, the X. L. Insurance Company and the Ace Insurance Company.
"We have begun receiving liability claims," said Mr. Weintraub.
As for coverage for property damage and lost business revenue, the first $10 million in coverage is held American Home Assurance Company and the Home Indemnity Company, said Mr. Weintraub. Additional layers up to $600 million are held by 11 different domestic insurers, Lloyd's of London syndicates or London based insurers, he said.

HEADLINE: Turning the Desktop PC Into a Talk Radio Medium

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 3

 BODY:
Talk radio is coming to desktop computers.
Within a few weeks, a Virginia-based entrepreneur plans to begin broadcasting a weekly 30-minute radio talk show on Internet, the global computer network that links together more than 10 million scientists, academics, engineers and high-tech industry executives. 
 Listening to such a program via computer instead of a radio might seem merely a digital curiosity. But many computer scientists and telecommunications experts believe it signals the first step in a transformation in which national and even global computer networks will fiercely compete with -- or even replace -- traditional television and radio networks that broadcast over the air or transmit by cable.
 
Listen Now, Listen Later
 Many desktop computers, including some of the less expensive models found in the home, now have speakers and software that permit sound effects. When the new program, to be called "Internet Talk Radio," makes its debut, Internet users will be able to obtain it as a file of computer data, just as they might "download" from the network a research report, data about a scientific experiment or any of thousands of other data files.
Listeners with sufficiently sophisticated gear can listen to the program as it is transmitted or choose to store the data in their computers and play it later. Listeners with less sophisticated equipment can hear it only after the data have been received and stored. Either way, the program will be divided into segments, so those Internet users who wish can select only parts of the program listed in a menu -- taking the book reviews, for instance, while passing up the week's news.
"We're not all going to start listening to radio on our computers yet," said Paul Saffo, a computer industry analyst at the Institute for the Future, Menlo Park, Calif. "But this is pregnant with possibilities. It's proof that the era of mass media is past."
 
For the 'Real Time' Crowd
 Initially, the new digital radio program will be targeted at the programmers and technically minded researchers who spend their days sitting in front of advanced computers writing or manipulating software and who have the high-speed connections to Internet that permit listening to the program in "real time" as it is received, while continuing to do other tasks on the machine.
But the new multimedia technology is viewed as gradually having a much broader audience as computer networks evolve from primarily a means of carrying business or scientific data into a new digital medium that will increasingly compete with conventional media like television, radio and newspapers.
There are no technical reasons why a video version of a program could not be carried on Internet, except that some portions of the network do not currently have sufficient carrying capacity. Those limitations are likely to disappear, however, as more of the network links are upgraded to fiber- optic circuits under efforts like Vice President Al Gore's "data superhighway."
"It's a brilliant idea," said Nicholas Negroponte, director of the Media Laboratory, a computer research center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "All of these guys -- newspapers, radio or television -- are really in the same business. We've always thought video or audio or data are different businesses. But today, when you radiate bits, those bits don't have to have a specific medium attached to them."
Blending the power of the computer with conventional radio or television could create an intriguing new media that will give viewers or listeners more control over what they receive while allowing them to interact with the media in a manner not now possible. Conceiveably, any Internet user could create his own audio or video program and and make it available on the network, just as the creator of Internet Talk Radio plans.
 
'Random Access Radio'
 The program is the brainchild of Carl Malamud, a 33-year-old economist and writer in Alexandria, Va., who helped pioneer a computer network for the board of governors of the Federal Reserve Board. Mr. Malamud is the author of a number of technical books on computer networks.
Attempting to capture the "feel" of popular radio programs such as National Public Radio's "All Things Considered," Mr. Malamud said he believed that he could successfully aim a commercially financed show at engineers and technically minded computer-network users by filling a gap left by the trade newspapers.
"I call this random access radio," he said. "Our listeners can start, stop, rewind, or otherwise control the operation of the radio station."
Mr. Malamud said the program already had three commercial sponsors: Sun Microsystems Inc., the computer work station manufacturer; O'Reilly & Associates, a technical book publisher, and Computer Literacy, a Silicon Valley bookstore chain.
The program will be aviable to network users in the United States, Europe and Japan.
Each weekly half-hour program, which will be taped and transmitted later, will be built around an interview with a person widely known in the computer network field -- or, as Mr. Malamud said he was dubbing the section, the "Geek of the Week." He said the main feature would be accompanied by a number of smaller segments that would include computer network news, gossip, book reviews and even restaurant reviews sent in by users of the computer network.
"My view is that desktop broadcasting is an easy thing to do," he said.
 
A Presidential Feed
 "Internet Talk Radio" is based on a series of emerging technologies being used experimentally by many Internet users. They have been recently experimenting with digital video conferencing, telephone calls and even music broadcasting over the computer network.
For example, during President Clinton's visit last week to the Silicon Valley computer maker Silicon Graphics Inc., a digitized version of the video feed of the event to the news media was simultaneously transmitted to employees so they could watch from their computer work stations. The same digital data stream was also accessible to Internet users with hardware sufficient to receive it.
The data file comprising the entire half-hour program will require 15 million bytes of computer storage space, the equivalent of about 15 good-sized novels. Such a file, while a mere morsel for a powerful work station, would occupy a significant portion of most home computers' storage capacity.
 
Getting Started
 Listening to the program as it is being transmitted requires a computer network capable of supporting a stream of data of 64,000 bits a second -- a rate that is higher than conventional personal-computer modems but well within the reach of standard office computer networks, which can send data at speeds of up to 10 million bits a second. A less sophisticated computer with a modem that receives data at 2,400 bits a second would require almost 14 hours to receive the entire program. But more sophisticated and lower-cost technology expected to be on the market soon would make such broadcasts available on home computers.
"Internet Talk Radio" will be transmitted in an audio format that has become a standard in the world of high-powered work stations. For personal computers, assuming they are equipped to handle sound, various adapter products on the market would allow the program to be heard.
Mr. Malamud said that his files would initially contain only audio, but there is no limitation against adding additional computer instructions to expand the power of the digital audio.
"I'm looking at equipment that lets me put signals that would do things like allow you to move to the beginning of the next question or the next time the speaker changes," he said. "Another possibility is to run multiple sound tracks for translations or annotations of an interview."
Mr. Negroponte said the rapid growth of the Internet was largely being ignored by the big players in publishing and broadcasting. Internet has expanded so quickly that even network officials cannot say with precision how many users there are. The best estimates indicate a global audience of more than 10 million computer users routinely exchange information and read electronic mail using the network.
"The big players are asleep at the wheel," Mr. Negroponte said. "This network is growing 15 percent each month. It's not just hackers anymore."

HEADLINE: A.M.A IS SOFTENING STAND ON CHANGES IN HEALTH SYSTEM

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
Fearful of being left out of the debate on reshaping the nation's health-care system, the American Medical Association has told the White House that it will drop its long-held and formidable opposition to some proposals favored by President Clinton.
In return, A.M.A. officials said, they are asking for a seat at the table as the policy group led by Hillary Rodham Clinton works out what promise to be sweeping changes in medicine. 
 In a letter sent today to Ira Magaziner, Mrs. Clinton's righthand man on health care, the group signaled its willingness to support the idea of "spending limits" on health care, to accept a National Health Board to review prices and practices in medicine and to accept that large "managed care" organizations like preferred-provider groups or health-maintenance organizations may be a large part of the health-care system in the future.
 
Some Caveats Expressed
 The A.M.A. put caveats on some of these items and repeated its opposition to other items under discussion by the White House, like the proposal for a "global budget" that would set a strict limit on the amount the nation spends on health care.
But the A.M.A. did offer to support a cap plan, probably less restrictive than the global-budget approach, under which doctors would accept national or regional health-care spending limits if they can help set them.
Robert Boorstin, a White House spokesman on health care, said today that the White House "welcomes the participation of the A.M.A., as we always have." He said the A.M.A.'s shift showed that a "consensus is being formed that there has to be immediate change, and that it is coalescing around the principles that the President's plan is being built on."
An A.M.A. spokesman today said that it is a "reasonable reading of the proposal" to say that the overall spending limits would be at the level of inflation in the rest of the economy. Last year, that was 2.9 percent, while inflation for doctors' fees and other medical costs was 6.6 percent.
 
Requested in Return
 In return for its concessions, the A.M.A. is asking that practicing doctors be represented on the White House health-care group and that a number of proposals be considered, including curbs on malpractice suits, assurance that some patients will still be able to choose doctors and the freedom of doctors to negotiate fees with any government board setting budgets.
The letter to Mr. Magaziner marks a "major change, a quite different approach for the A.M.A.," said one association spokesman.
It was an especially significant shift for an organization that has been viewed as responsible for killing a number of health-care proposals in the past. The medical association, with its more than 290,000 members and its lobbying budget of tens of millions of dollars, could have posed a substantial obstacle to a Clinton package, and its support could add momentum to attempts to press the package both before the public and in Congress.
In the past, the association and allied doctors have been credited with killing health-insurance proposals in the Administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, defeating President Harry S. Truman's national health program and halting President Jimmy Carter's hospital cost-containment measures.
 
New Climate in Capital
 But in the new climate in Washington, according to various A.M.A. officials, the group worried that it was being left behind as Democrats on Capitol Hill, other medical organizations and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association have embraced "managed competition" and some limits on price increases.
The A.M.A. proposal was delivered to the White House today, after last-minute changes were made Tuesday night to back away from some more specific proposals, like expressing a willingness to freeze fees for a short time if asked by the Administration.
The letter offered to join in the "shared sacrifice" by others in health care when the final proposals for change are made in May. It said that the A.M.A. proposes a "new partnership" with the Government.
"We know that status quo must go," wrote the A.M.A. executive vice president, Dr. James S. Todd, but he also warned the White House that doctors have so far been excluded from shaping the new package, and that "any reform system will fail without the support of the profession."
 
What Clinton Wants
 The main elements of the Administration package include keeping costs down, reforming insurance rules, letting people choose their doctors and keeping the quality of health care high, Mr. Boorstin said.
The A.M.A.'s offer is widely seen as an attempt to regain leadership. Others, most notably the American College of Physicians last fall, have been quicker to support some of the Clinton proposals.
In addition, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Nurses Association have led the way with offers to support a ceiling on medical spending imposed by the Government or a national health board.
Many doctors have been the beneficiaries of huge pay increases and realize that they are likely to be targets for anger and budget-cutting if they do not offer to make sacrifices now. Between 1983 and 1991, the mean income of doctors has gone from $88,000 to $170,000 per year, according to the A.M.A.'s own figures. The lowest-paid doctors are family physicians, making $111,000 per year; the highest are surgeons, at $234,000 per year.
 
'Share Our Knowledge'
 Dr. Todd said the doctors' group "wants to be part of the center of the picture, a significant player. We want to share our knowledge."
The offer to the White House goes beyond the positions the group has been willing to take in the past on several counts. The group has come around to the view that managed care -- in the form of preferred-provider organizations or health-maintenance organizations, in which doctors are on staff, rather than acting as self-employed free agents paid on a fee-for-service basis -- is an acceptable model for health care as long as it is possible for some doctors to continue to operate on a fee-for-service basis.
There was some suspicion expressed about the proposal by others in Washington. Ronald Pollack, director of Families USA, a not-for-profit health-care advocacy group in Washington, and a health-care expert who advised the Clinton campaign, said that his guess was that the A.M.A. proposal was something of a Trojan Horse. "They are trying to say as many pleasant things as they can say," he said.

Money Fund Yields Mixed As Assets Shrink for Week

BYLINE: By SUSAN ANTILLA

 BODY:
Yields offered by money market funds were mixed in the latest week, and assets fell as investors chose to make larger commitments to the stock and bond markets.
The average yield on tax-exempt funds fell. Taxable funds were up very slightly. 
 According to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report, assets of tax-exempt money funds fell by $925 million for the week, to a total of $101.6 billion. The average number of days left to maturity of securities held in fund portfolios was 55 days, up from 51 days last week. "They're extending out on the yield curve as well they should be," Walter S. Frank, chief economist at IBC/Donoghue, said.
The seven-day simple yield was 1.82 percent, down 6 basis points from last week, while the seven-day average compounded yield was 1.84, also down 6 basis points. The 30-day simple yield was at 1.92 percent, down 5 basis points. The 30-day compounded yield was at 1.94 percent, also down 5 basis points from last week.
 
 
Top Local Funds
 The top funds among tax-exempts in metropolitan New York were AIM Tax-Exempt Cash Fund of Connecticut, with a seven-day compounded yield of 2.13 percent; Vanguard New Jersey Tax Free/Money Market Portfolio, with a seven-day compounded yield of of 2.22 percent, and Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compounded yield of 2.14 percent. In general, all the tax-free fund yields were down from last week, Mr. Frank said.
Among tax-free funds with assets of more than $100 million, Dreyfus Basic Municipal Money Market fund led the nation with a seven-day compounded yield of 2.54 percent.
Assets in taxable money market funds were down by $17.3 billion, to $476.8 billion. Of the $17.3 billion reduction, $15.5 billion came from money market funds owned exclusively by institutional investors, Mr. Frank said. "There could be a billion dollars' worth of the public doing the same thing, but that's not important" compared with the size of the institutional outflow, he said.
 
 
Stocks and Bonds Favored
 "This week, money was going back into the stock and bond markets" and out of money funds, he noted. Apart from the outflow activity, little was happening in the money fund segment because the Federal Reserve "is holding tight," Mr. Frank said.
The seven-day simple yield on taxable funds was up 2 basis points, to 2.71 percent, while the seven-day average compounded yield was up 1 basis point, to 2.74 percent. The 30-day simple yield was unchanged at 2.72 percent, while the 30-day compounded yield fell by 1 basis point, to 2.75 percent, essentially the effect of rounding numbers.
The number of days to maturity of securities held in taxable money market funds was unchanged over last week, at 61 days.
The top general purpose money fund with assets of more than $100 million was Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series, with a seven-day compounded yield of 3.53 percent.
The top government-only money fund was United Services Government Securities Savings, with a seven-day compounded yield of 3.55 percent. "That's unusual," Mr. Frank said, explaining that general purpose funds typically outperform government funds.

HEADLINE: Northeast Leads Other Regions of U.S. in Home Foreclosures

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
The Northeast states continue to lead the nation in the number of people losing their homes for failing to meet mortgage payments, a trade group said today.
California and other Sun Belt states are catching up, said the group, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, registering some of the sharpest increases in what economists call perhaps the most telling indicator of individual households in economic crisis. 
 "This is the highest we've ever seen," Thomas E. Hylinski, a first vice president in charge of residential lending at People's Bank, one of Connecticut's largest mortgage lenders, said of the number of Connecticut residents who were losing their homes.
 
Foreclosures in New Jersey
 In its quarterly report, made public here today, the association said that lower interest rates had buoyed many family budgets as homeowners refinanced mortgages and reduced their monthly payments and that throughout much of the country the numbers of late mortgage payments had fallen to an 18-year-low.
But the group said that in the Northeast and in Southern California, where hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost in the aerospace industry and across a wide swath of white-collar jobs, lower monthly payments had not been enough. Those areas, perhaps by coincidence, also have some of the highest housing prices in the nation, meaning that laid-off homeowners, carrying bigger mortgages than they might elsewhere in the country, have a shorter time to sink or swim.
In New Jersey, for example, 2.44 percent, or nearly one in 40 residential mortgages, was in some stage of foreclosure in the last quarter of 1992, by far the highest rate in the nation, according to the Mortgage Bankers' survey. Massachusetts was second, with 1.8 percent, followed by Connecticut at 1.73 percent. New York and New Hampshire were tied for the fifth highest rate at 1.52 percent.
Foreclosure, when a lender actually begins taking back a property, is always the last resort, economists say, after monthly payments have been missed for at least three months and far longer than that in many cases. With prices of houses falling in many parts of the country, banks have been reluctant to take back properties that they will then have to try to resell. They say the high foreclosure rate also indicates the persistence and depth of the economic downturn, since people who lose their homes have generally exhausted their savings.
"It's really a sure sign of distress," said Emanuel Tobier, a professor of economics at New York University. Professor Tobier said that the rate of late mortgage payments, or delinquencies, are the "first bell," in gauging the degree of economic turmoil in any one region, or in individual household. "Foreclosure is where the curtain comes down," he said. "It's a very drastic step."
And while mortgage lenders said they expect the Northeast to continue to lead the nation in repossessions through this year, other regions that fell later into the recession are catching up fast.
 
Setbacks in West
 Among new foreclosures begun in the last three months of 1992, Arizona led the nation with 52 hundredths of a percent of all the surveyed residential mortgages entering foreclosure in just one three-month period, the mortgage lenders group said. California showed one of the sharpest increases in the number of mortgages in foreclosure, nearly doubling in 1992, to 98 hundredths of a percent, the report said. The Mortgage Bank numbers are based on a survey of 16.1 million mortgages, representing about one-third of the total residential mortgages in the country.
There were some indications that what had been an improving trend through part of 1992, even in the Northeast, has perhaps stalled. The group's report said that in many Northeastern states, the percentage of delinquent mortgages, defined as late by 30 days or more, had fallen through the first three quarters of 1992, raising hope that economic recovery and lower interest rates would carry the region out of its housing slump.
But then, in the fourth quarter, the numbers began to climb again.

HEADLINE: U.S. Upset With Japan On Chip Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
Clinton Administration officials say they are dissatisfied with Japanese compliance with a 1991 trade agreement on computer chips, but the Administration -- and the domestic semiconductor industry -- is leaning against imposing any immediate sanctions.
Because of their importance to the automobile, consumer electronics and computer industries, computer chips have long ranked among the most contentious trans-Pacific trade issues. 
 Washington trade experts are awaiting the Administration's reaction to statistics on Japanese compliance as a signpost of the Clinton Administration's trade policies toward Japan. It is widely expected that when the figures are released on March 19, Japan will fall short of the import target in the agreement.
 
Trade Official Comments
 Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, took a tough stand tonight when asked a question at a dinner for semiconductor industry executives. "We're going to enforce these agreements," he said. "We have to or we shouldn't have entered into them in the first place."
Afterward, Mr. Kantor emphasized that no decisions on sanctions had been made. "There are just a number of options available to us -- I have not ruled out anything nor have I ruled anything in," he said.
But other Administration officials said that nobody in the Cabinet or the industry was pushing for trade sanctions to match the punitive import tariffs once imposed by President Ronald Reagan. Although attitudes could easily change, the Administration's inclination seems to be to take a cautious approach when the figures are released and gauge the reactions of the American public and the American and Japanese industries.
President Clinton owes a debt to Silicon Valley because of its early support for his candidacy last year. The President is also trying to give his Administration a high-technology image.
The importance the Administration places on the industry is evident at this week's lobbying meeting here of the Semiconductor Industry Association. The annual meeting, which never attracted a Cabinet official during the Bush Administration, has been addressed by two Cabinet officials. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown preceded Mr. Kantor, telling the group on Tuesday night about the technology aspects of the Clinton budget.
President Reagan imposed steep import tariffs in 1987 on some Japanese power tools and color television sets in retaliation for what were seen as Japanese restrictions on computer chip imports.
 
The Pact's Impetus
 The 1991 pact canceled the Reagan-imposed tariffs and set an informal target for the Japanese to purchase 20 percent of their computer chips from abroad by the end of 1992. Imported chips accounted for 15.9 percent of the Japanese market in the third quarter, and appear to have gained some market share during the fourth quarter, according to preliminary figures compiled by the semiconductor industry.
James A. Norling, the president of Motorola's semiconductor products division and the chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said that a call for sanctions remained possible. "There would be a handful of options, and that would be one of them," he said.
The industry might not press for sanctions, he said, if Japan pledges that its foreign chip purchases will average 20 percent of the market this year. To meet that goal, Japan would have to increase its foreign chip purchases through the year, ending above 20 percent.
The Administration of George Bush kept the 1991 semiconductor agreement deliberately murky to avoid the look of managed trade. The agreement states that the targets are "neither a guarantee, a ceiling nor a floor on the foreign market share."
Partly departing from his speech, Mr. Kantor also delivered tonight an impassioned description of the suffering of American men and women who lose their jobs because of import competition. "The result has been a rising tide of resentment, a feeling among many Americans that they were getting the short end of the stick," he said.

HEADLINE: Passage of Health-Care Bill Seen as Unlikely This Year

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said today that Congress was unlikely to pass a comprehensive health-care bill this year, despite strong urging by President Clinton and the Senate majority leader.
Mr. Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat whose panel has written a large portion of the nation's tax and health laws, said Mr. Clinton's health legislation would probably be too big and too complex to combine with the President's economic package. But he and other lawmakers expressed confidence that Congress would pass a health-care bill to the President's liking next year. 
 Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, proposed Sunday that the health-care measure be attached to a giant bill raising taxes and cutting Federal spending. Such a combination would have procedural advantages for the Administration. The Ways and Means Committee will handle the tax changes and some of the spending cuts proposed by Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Rostenkowski said he had told Hillary Rodham Clinton that he would bend in the wind "like a palm tree" in his efforts to accommodate the Clinton Administration's wishes. But in view of the complexity of health-care legislation, he said, "it would be extremely difficult to get it done this year."
 
White House Reaction
 Informed of Mr. Rostenkowski's views, George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said tonight: "We know that passing a comprehensive health-care plan is difficult, but it's also necessary. We look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Rostenkowski and the rest of the Congress to pass real health-care reform as soon as possible."
Asked if all the legislative work could be completed this year, Mr. Stephanopoulos said, "We certainly hope so, and that's our goal."
The information about Mr. Rostenkowski's views came from James M. Jaffe, a spokesman for the Congressman, who said: "Rosty thinks that health-care reform is basically a two-year job. He feels it would be legislatively and logistically a real long shot to do it all this year."
In an impassioned address to Congress last month, Mr. Clinton said efforts to strengthen the economy would fail unless Congress took bold steps to revamp the health-care system "this year -- not next year, not five years from now, but this year."
In the Senate, Mr. Mitchell and the President would gain significant procedural advantages if lawmakers combined a health-care bill with a deficit-reduction measure. Senators generally cannot wage a filibuster against a deficit-reduction bill, known as a reconciliation bill, because there is a 20-hour limit to debate on the bill, including amendments to it.
A group of more than 50 liberal Democrats from the House and the Senate today introduced a bill that would establish a system of national health insurance financed mainly by the Federal Government. The bill would provide care for all Americans in two years by raising taxes, scrapping most private insurance and authorizing the Government to pay most medical bills.
The main sponsors of the legislation, Representatives Jim McDermott of Washington and John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, and Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, said they would cooperate with the White House. While acknowledging that Congress would probably not pass a measure exactly like their bill, they said they hoped it would influence the debate.
"Managed competition is the creation of the Jackson Hole Group," said Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio, a co-sponsor of the bill. "And what is the Jackson Hole Group? It consists of the people who are profiting most from the system as it is: insurance companies, hospital associations, drug companies."
Under the bill, states would have authority to design and run their own health-care programs. But the Federal Government would prescribe a minimum package of benefits and would set a budget to limit health spending in each state. One entity in each state would collect all insurance premiums and pay all medical bills, using Federal money for the most part.
Where Mr. Clinton would require all employers to provide or obtain health insurance for their employees, the Wellstone bill would break the link between insurance and employment.
 
Cigarette Tax Rise Urged
 In a separate action, Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Representative Michael A. Andrews of Texas, both Democrats, proposed increasing the Federal excise tax to $1 for a pack of cigarettes. The tax is now 24 cents.
They would use 80 percent of the new revenue to help finance health care for people who are now uninsured. The Administration is considering similar proposals, including one that would raise the cigarette tax to $2 a pack.
The Federal Government collected $5 billion in tobacco taxes last year. Senator Bradley estimated that the proposed tax would generate an additional sum of $8 billion to $10 billion a year for the Government. There is bipartisan support in Congress for increasing the tobacco tax to pay for health care, but the amount of the tax is uncertain.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was noncommittal when asked today if the Clinton health-care proposal should be attached to the economic program. "I'm not about to tell the leadership of the Senate or the House how to package this thing," he said. "We're going to keep our options open."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Mazda Ends Idea of a Ford Pact for Europe

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 3

 BODY:
The Mazda Motor Corporation said today that it had given up the idea of establishing joint European automobile production with the Ford Motor Company because the two companies could not agree on a plan.
The decision, the latest setback among hard-pressed Japanese automobile makers, could make Mazda the only major Japanese manufacturer without a plant in Europe and could lead to restrictions on its sale of cars there, in light of increasingly stringent quotas on imported Japanese vehicles. 
 "It definitely puts a tarnish on the company for the long term," said Peter Boardman, automobile analyst for UBS Phillips & Drew International in Tokyo.
 
Needs a Partner
 Because of its weak financial condition, brought about in part by the steep slump in Japan's automobile market in the last two years, Mazda cannot afford to build a European factory on its own. Mazda has already had to scale back other plans, including a luxury line and a dealer network in the United States.
Sumitomo Bank, which has supported Mazda in the past and even saved it from near-collapse, cannot help much now because it is weighed down by bad loans as a result of the collapse of Japan's speculative economy of the late 1980's.
Since October 1989, Mazda had been negotiating with Ford, which owns nearly 25 percent of the company. While specifics were never announced, there has been speculation that Mazda wanted to produce small cars at a Ford factory in Germany.
 
Ford Has Its Own Problems
 But analysts say it has become evident in recent months that Ford was reluctant to agree to joint production because the European automobile market is in the midst of a downturn. Ford itself suffered heavy losses in Europe last year and does not want to see a competitor strengthened.
Toyota and Honda opened European factories last year, joining Nissan, which has been producing in Britain for six years. One goal is to get around "voluntary" quotas on Japanese car exports to the European Community that were agreed to in 1991. Just this week, community negotiators were in Tokyo pressing the Japanese Government to agree to a reduction in exports for 1993 because the overall market in Europe is expected to shrink further. No agreement on the quota was reached.
Mazda, which sent 283,000 cars to Europe in 1992 out of its total exports of 801,000, said it was exploring other options for production in Europe. While there have been reports of Mazda's talking with French auto makers, analysts say it might not be easy for Mazda to find a partner, because many European auto companies already have links with other Japanese companies or have taken strong anti-Japanese stances.

HEADLINE: U.N. Boycott Has Belgrade Angry at U.S.

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, March 3

 BODY:
With consumer prices tripling each month because of economic sanctions against Serbia, Panaskeva Babic's pension of 155,000 dinars a month is not enough to live on.
On Tuesday she stood in front of a bank offering to spare someone the misery of standing in line all night to pick up a monthly interest payment, a service for which she was asking 10 German marks, or about $6.50, the value of her monthly pension. 
 The few private banks pay 200 percent a year for deposits in dinars, and about 50 percent for deposits in marks, rates that attract so many customers that all-night lines are unavoidable.
"If I'm lucky enough to find someone, I'll be here for the next 24 hours," Mrs. Babic said, as she wrapped her scarf tight against the snow beginning to fall from a leaden sky. Her son was in his last year at the university, she said, and unless she did this they could not survive.
 
Who, Exactly, Is the Bad Guy?
 The sanctions that cause many of the miseries suffered by Mrs. Babic are intended to pressure the government of Serbia and its president, Slobodan Milosevic, to stop encouraging militant Serbian nationalists in war-ravaged Bosnia and Herzegovina.
But in conversations on the streets, people are more likely to vent their frustration on the United States and the European countries for supporting the United Nations sanctions than on Mr. Milosevic and his government.
"Why are Serbs called pigs in your newspapers?" one woman with a baby demanded after accosting an American the other day on a six-hour bus journey from Budapest. She insisted that The Chicago Tribune had used the word, though the source of her protest apparently was an editorial cartoon depicting Serbs as pigs.
"All we hear is 'Serbia, Serbia, Serbia,' " said Alexandar Mitrovic, a Yugoslav Airlines steward thrown out of work by the effects of the embargo. "Serbs have suffered, too."
Belgrade does not look like a capital at war, and officially neither Serbia nor the Yugoslav federation is waging one. (Of its original six republics, only Serbia and Montenegro remain.)
But armed militiamen in battle fatigues occasionally walk the streets, which are nearly empty of traffic. Hardly anyone can find gasoline, or afford the little that is available at $4 a gallon.
Grocery stores have few imported goods, but local supplies seem more than ample, though the stores raise their prices daily. This week, a quarter-pound of coffee cost 31,000 dinars, one-tenth of an average monthly salary.
The sanctions have clearly made Serbs aware that they are in a grave crisis.
"Very soon the people will have to rise up, because they cannot live," said Radoslav Stojanovic, a leader of the opposition Serbian Democratic Party. Two years ago, on March 9, 1991, thousands of people did demonstrate against the Serbian government, which has since been returned to office with a comfortable election majority.
But Mr. Stojanovic acknowledged that the sanctions had made many ordinary Serbs more willing to support Mr. Milosevic and his defiant nationalism, rather than try to overthrow him.
 
'Gringos Go Home'
 "Western sanctions include culture and sports events," he said. "The people wanted to have basketball and soccer world championships here, and Milosevic can say the West and the United States prevented that -- and the people will believe him."
Hostility toward the United States does seem to be on the rise in a country that long looked to America as a protector. The United States Cultural Center in the center of Belgrade was stoned last month, and "Gringos Go Home" is spray-painted on the walls.
Yet the sanctions have clearly sobered those in ruling circles here.
"The sanctions have begun ruining us economically," said Svetozar Stojanovic, an adviser to President Dobrica Cosic of Yugoslavia. "If the purpose is to ruin us and also the regime here, the sanctions are working very well."
According to the adviser, sanctions are also inflicting pain on the country's neighbors, as Mr. Cosic found during a recent trip to Romania.
"The Romanians tell us they count their losses in the billions," he said. All traffic on the Danube has been held up for a week because Serbian barges have been barricading the river to protest the embargo, and Mr. Cosic promised during a visit last week to try to get them moved. They were still there this week.
 
Who, Exactly, Is in Charge?
 President Cosic has little real power. Mr. Milosevic controls the national television and it is he, not Mr. Cosic, that the Serbian militants in Bosnia and Croatia seem ready to follow.
But the President's adviser asserted that "Milosevic has not much more leverage on them than we do." But he said pressure on the Serbs had made them more willing to accept a compromise to end the fighting in Bosnia.
Milovan Djilas, the 81-year-old former Communist leader who spent nearly 10 years in Tito's jails, said he also found grounds for some optimism in the way Serbia had acquiesced in President Clinton's decision to airdrop relief supplies to the mostly Muslim villages in eastern Bosnia that are under siege by Serbian forces.
"Nobody can come out against aid to civilians, even if they oppose it in secret for the Muslims," Mr. Djilas said.

HEADLINE: San Salvador Journal;
As Workplace Buddies, Wartime Foes Forge Peace

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, Feb. 26

 BODY:
When Hector Antonio Barrientos Lopez bums a cigarette from one of his fellow apprentices, the two often marvel that the simple, amicable exchange can occur between two men who fought on opposite sides in the civil war that ended a year ago.
"One of us will always say, 'Who's going to believe this?' " Mr. Barrientos, a former guerrilla, said as he paused in his task of hand-painting letters and designs on wall plaques in a workshop in the heart of San Salvador. 
 Sometimes, said Martin Edgar Realagano, a former Government soldier, the brief conversations during breaks will turn up the information that two men had taken part in the same battle -- on opposite sides.
The shared work and collegiality at the Cooperative Association of Artisan Production are among the many signs in El Salvador that peace is succeeding after 12 years of war between left and right.
The workshop, which combines training with a production and sales operation for the plaques, is the creation of David J. Wiesenfeld, a California idealist who set up the project, which he characterizes as his own foreign aid program, with little money and big hopes.
 
Hand-to-Mouth Existence
 The workshop lives hand to mouth. Occasionally, Mr. Wiesenfeld has obtained money from the Agency for International Development and its Canadian equivalent; the rest of the income comes from an informal network of Americans who have come through El Salvador or worked here in recent years and send back orders from their companies or organizations after they return home.
"I've found out that our Government is not set up to deal with one person with a dream who wants to make a positive contribution," said Mr. Wiesenfeld, who is deeply frustrated at not being able to obtain sustained financing through the big United States foreign aid program in El Salvador.
The workshop currently has 12 apprentices -- all disabled war veterans from the army or the guerrillas' Farabundo Marti Front -- receiving a small allowance and five salaried teachers. Many more apprentices would like to join, some recommended by their former guerrilla or military organizations.
"I haven't promised permanent employment to the apprentices after they finish their 1,000 hours of training," Mr. Wiesenfeld said. "But I have said I will try to absorb them the best that we can. Much depends on whether we can get better distribution of our plaques in the United States."
Until he came to Central America soon after finishing an engineering degree, the 38-year-old Mr. Wiesenfeld's main work experience had been as a volunteer fireman in his hometown, Carmel-by-the-Sea. After some years in Guatemala, he found his way to El Salvador in 1987 and was impressed by the handicrafts, which he thought displayed a Salvadoran aptitude for detailed lacquer painting on wood.
 
Matching Skills and Market
 Remembering how his fellow firefighters used to order plaques for their offices and trucks and to give as awards, he thought he could organize something that would match the skill with a market.
All the design work on the plaques is painted by hand by the apprentices from patterns created by the teachers. They use automotive body paint, which Mr. Wiesenfeld says gives the highest gloss.
For the apprentices, the workshop is both a place to unwind from the experience of a war that left all of them with some kind of disability and a place to begin to think about what the future may hold for them.
"This helps create emotional stability," said Luis Alonso Recinos, another former guerrilla at the workshop.
Mr. Barrientos, who is 28 and carries a fragment of an army grenade in his head, said, "In the process of transition we need a lot of support from friendly countries."
Eventually, he hopes to get a scholarship through one of the reconstruction programs that would allow him to study business administration, a field that has become all the rage among former guerrillas since their leaders embraced free-market economics.
"It's not easy to insert yourself into civilian life after spending years in clandestine existence," he said, adding that he was pleased at how much had been accomplished in just a year of peace.
"Before, the Farabundo Marti Front had no possibility of peaceful political activity," he said. "Now it does. Our people are not being persecuted."
 
Their Common Bond
 Mr. Realagano, a 30-year-old former army corporal who lost his right leg in combat in the Usulutan area in 1986, said the fact that everybody in the workshop was disabled created a common bond transcending the politics of the past.
He said the association of disabled army veterans, of which he is a leader, was beginning to deal with the grouping of disabled former guerrillas to advance their common need for pensions and job training.
He said one high-ranking army officer had called the disabled soldiers Communists for dealing with the former enemy.
"But if we are in a process of reconciliation," he said, "we have to learn to relate to all Salvadorans."
"I haven't found it difficult to work alongside people from the Marti Front," he added. "The ideology of the armed forces made us hate them, especially when a comrade fell, but now there is no reason to continue to hate them. We are brothers of the same blood."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Rates Fall Again To Lows

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates dropped once more to record lows yesterday, leading some analysts to say that the credit market is not being driven by daily developments but by a shift to a long-term view that sees only modest economic growth and low inflation.
The 30-year Treasury bond continued its two-week rally, which has seen long-term yields fall a third of a percentage point and crash through the 7 percent barrier. Yesterday, the yield dropped to 6.78 percent, from 6.83 percent on Tuesday, as prices surged. Yields on other Treasury issues also declined again. 
 "When you see markets do this sort of thing, you have to step away from the daily events," said Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers, referring to the sharp rallies in Treasury prices.
 
A 'Fundamental Adjustment'
 "This is a market that is making a fundamental adjustment in its long-range view of inflation and growth," he said. "It all has the look of close your eyes and go."
One of the changes that could come with this new view is the shrinking of the so-called inflation premium or hedge that is incorporated into long-term interest rates. Since the high inflation rates of the late 1970's, this premium has been about four percentage points. But with more confidence in stable low inflation, the premium could fall to it historical levels of 3 percent or a little less, pulling long-term rates down with it.
This change in view has been coming for some time, as the falling long-term rates over the last year indicate. But President's Clinton's economic proposals to reduce the deficit has given it an added vibrance.
Economists and analysts think that his proposals, with spending cuts and tax increases, will prevent any sharp surge in economic growth during the recovery and keep the economy moving at only a moderate pace in the next several years. All of this would mean low inflation.
 
Yields of 10-Year Notes Fall
 The price of the 30-year bond jumped 24/32 , to 10414/32 , as the yield dropped to its lowest point since 30-year bonds were regularly issued 16 years ago.
The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note dropped to 5.87 percent, the lowest since early 1972. The yield was down from 5.92 percent the day before. The yield on the five-year Treasury note dropped to 5.04 percent, a level not seen since March 1971.
There was no big economic news yesterday to start the rally, although weaker-than-expected 10-day auto sales did help, traders who looked for daily causes said. Other analysts said that there still seemed to be a lot of cash in mutual funds as new money was coming in from the public. And this money is being pushed into the bond market
Robert D. Sbarra, a managing director at Carroll McEntee & McGinely, said that the rally also got impetus from the tax-exempt municipal market, where refinancings of old, higher-interest bonds picked up steam as interest rates declined. As part of this refinancing, state and local governments buy Treasury securities with the new low-interest-rate loans to pay off the old ones.
But Mr. Sbarra also agreed that bigger forces were at work. "The market," he said, "is clearly in a mode where nobody wants to fight it."
 
Port Authority
 Traders said that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey did not pay any premium or penalty because of the World Trade Center explosion when it sold $100 million of new tax-exempt bonds yesterday.
The competitively bid issue was won by a syndicate lead by Merrill Lynch & Company. The total interest cost for the Port Authority was 5.44 percent. The aggressiveness of the bidding -- which shows that the competing syndicates are not worried by the financial consequences of the damage to the trade center -- was reflected in the tightness of the bids. The second-lowest total interest cost bid was 5.446 percent, according to Barry Weintrob, the chief financial officer of the Port Authority.
"It has been important that the Port Authority has been so forthcoming about what is going on," Paul Kuhns, a director of the national municipal syndicate at Merrill Lynch, said. The issue, which was also attractive because it is noncallable, has yields ranging from 5.15 percent in 2008 to 5.30 percent in 2012 to 5.439 percent in 2038.
 
Toll Road Bonds
 Investors willing to take the risk of betting on the successful completion and use of a 15-mile toll road in Orange County, Calif., were well rewarded yesterday. The yield on the 30-year tax-exempt bonds sold by the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency was 6.881 percent, higher than the yield on taxable Treasury bonds. This yield is equal to 9.97 percent at the current top Federal tax rate of 31 percent.
But the investors may be taking a risk. There have been problems in road projects whose bonds are paid off with toll revenues, including the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel, the Calumet Skyway in Chicago and the West Virginia Turnpike. Others, like the New Jersey Turnpike, have worked, however.
The $1.1 billion issue, which was underwritten by the First Boston Corporation and included several kinds of bonds, was rated BBB by Fitch.
According to a Fitch analyst, Andrea R. Bozzo, Fitch believes the project will be able to pay off the bonds because of "the need for the facility to alleviate the congestion in the county and to accommodate future development." The toll road is scheduled to be finished by March 1997.

HEADLINE: Airbus's Latest Flies Into the Storm

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAMBURG, Germany, March 3

 BODY:
With President Clinton's attack on Europe for subsidizing its aircraft builders still echoing here, the European Airbus consortium today introduced the A321, which it touted as a new airplane made without government support.
But much turned on definitions, as has always been the case in the long-simmering dispute between the United States and Europe about whether unfair European government subsidies are costing jobs and profits in American aerospace. The 186-seat A321 is not, by most measures, a new aircraft at all. It can also be argued that the plane is subsidized nearly as much as Airbus's five other models. 
 The A321 introduction hereis just the latest skirmish in more than two decades of battles between the United States and Europe over the manufacture of commercial jetliners, one of the world's largest industries.
 
 
Assertions by Clinton
 Statements by President Clinton last month at the Boeing Company reignited a debate over whether government aid to Airbus Industrie amounts to unfair subsidies that are working to eliminate American jobs, as the President said, or is Europe's only way of competing with an American aerospace industry that has benefited from decades of Government spending on military and space programs.
 New or not, subsidized or not, the A321, which will be delivered to airlines starting next year, will compete with Boeing's planes.
It will make it more difficult for the McDonnell Douglas Corporation of St. Louis, the world's third-largest builder of jetliners, after Boeing and Airbus, to stay in the business. And it will further cement Airbus's remarkable success in bringing together the industries of four nations to make Europe a powerhouse in aircraft manufacturing, with all of the jobs, technological prowess and export strength that entails.
"This is an outstanding example of what the Europeans are capable of achieving when they work together," Jurgen E. Schrempp, the chief executive of Deutsche Aerospace A.G., the German partner in Airbus, told an audience of goverment officials, aerospace and airline executives and journalists here.
"On such a beautiful and important day," Mr. Schrempp continued, to considerable applause, "I will refrain from commenting at all on the totally unjustified, and, I might add, uncalled-for noises from America on the Airbus issue."
 For the A321, Airbus raised on its own, from nongovernment sources, the $480 million needed to develop the plane. But it is nothing more than a slightly larger version of the five-year-old A320, and shares the older plane's basic designs and all of its important technology. In developing the A320, the consortium received low-interest loans of $1.7 billion from the governments of France, Germany, Britain and Spain.
Since it was founded in 1970 by partners from those four countries, Airbus has grown to capture 30 percent of the aircraft market outside the former Soviet Union. It now competes in every part of the market except for 747-sized jumbo jets.
Its primary victim in America has not been Boeing, as the President suggested, but rather McDonnell Douglas, which in the last several years has won less than 10 percent of new aircraft orders and is dogged by speculation -- denied by the company -- that it will quit the jetliner business. Boeing has so far maintained its market share of roughly 50 percent, but increasingly finds itself going head to head with Airbus in selling its planes to airlines. In many of those cases, Boeing is losing.
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have also been battered by declining Pentagon spending. President Clinton's remarks came after Boeing said it would eliminate more than 25,000 jobs because of a lack of new orders and the cancellation of existing ones.
 
 
Different Type of Aid
 It is debatable whether, as President Clinton suggested, the job losses at Boeing are largely a result of unfair competition from Airbus. But Airbus has clearly benefited from government aid of a type that is not available to Boeing or McDonnell Douglas in the United States.
"It's not a simplistic situation of Airbus's accounting for all the losses," said a Congressional staff member who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But Airbus has played a significant role in the decline of the U.S. aerospace industry. If you look at who is best able to weather the storm, it's probably the consortium that gets a signficant amount of government aid."
Mr. Clinton's statements have done nothing to dull Airbus's competitive zeal. "In October of '85, there was a President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, who began to speak out about Airbus, and at that time we had 15 percent" of the market, said Jean Pierson, Airbus's chief executive. "Now we have 30 percent, and maybe someday we'll have 45 percent."
Airbus officials said that the consortium had received roughly $1 billion in loans to develop its first plane, the 250-seat A300, which entered service in 1974. The consortium got another $1 billion for its next plane, the A310. In the case of the first two planes, the government loans accounted for all of the development costs. Airbus received $1.7 billion in government development loans for the A320, or 75 percent of the development cost. For its most recent designs, the long-range A330 and A340, it received a total of $3.5 billion in loans, accounting for 60 percent of the development costs, the executives said.
The total of $7.3 billion in loans rises to roughly $13 billion when interest is included, they said. Without such support, they said, it would have been impossible for Europe to become a competitor in commercial aerospace. Banks and other financing sources would never have made loans of that size.
Airbus executives said that all of the loans were being repaid and that in some cases the governments that lent money to the consortium would also receive royalty payments based on the number of airplanes sold. Last year, the executives said, Airbus repaid $700 million in loans, and plans to repay between $900 million and $1 billion for the next several years, with the loans scheduled to be paid off completely around 2006.
 
 
Lucrative Research Contracts
 The European Community says that Government support for aerospace in the United States amounts to considerably more money, just in a different form. A study commissioned by the community said government payments to American aerospace companies amounted to more than $33 billion in the last two decades, in the form of research contracts -- from the Pentagon and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration -- that yield commercially valuable technical advances.
"I'd prefer to have a European NASA and its research contracts than loans that I have to repay," Mr. Pierson said.
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have long contended that Airbus has an unfair advantage because of its direct government support. Boeing executives attributed their loss last year of a $3 billion, 50-plane order from United Airlines to Airbus's ability to offer financing terms that Boeing, without government aid, could not afford to match.
But both companies gave grudging support to an agreement to limit subsidies that was negotiated last summer between the European Community and the United States. The agreement did nothing to address the issue of loans or subsidies already granted. It did, however, limit direct government financial aid to 33 percent of development costs on future programs, and capped indirect aid in the form of government contracts to 3 percent of industrywide sales, or 4 percent of a company's sales.
 The agreement was also praised by Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a top economic adviser to Mr. Clinton, in her book "Who's Bashing Whom? Trade Conflict in High-Technology Industries," published last fall. In the book, Ms. Tyson noted that the agreement had several loopholes, including one allowing either side to ignore the aid limits if the survival of an aircraft manufacturer was at stake. But, she wrote, "the 1992 agreement is a noteworthy accomplishment for both sides and a major improvement" over a previous and largely ineffectual accord signed in 1979.
Neither Mr. Clinton nor Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, has given any indication of wanting to renegotiate the deal. But with technological leadership and high-paying jobs on the line, some members of Congress are pressing the Administration to be more aggressive. Senator John C. Danforth, a Republican from Missouri, the home state of McDonnell Douglas, introduced legislation last month calling for the Commerce Department to study whether it should impose countervailing duties on Airbus planes sold in the United States.
There are also pressures within the United States to avoid a trade war over aircraft. American companies are big suppliers to Airbus, including the two leading jet-engine manufacturers, the General Electric Company and the Pratt & Whitney division of the United Technologies Corporation, and industry executives said they would oppose any trade barriers. Airlines in the United States are among Airbus's biggest customers, and they have benefited from the competition Airbus has brought to the business, in terms of improvements in reliability, operating costs and technology, as well as price.
There are also signs that Boeing and McDonnell Douglas themselves do not want to push the subsidy argument too far. McDonnell Douglas has been seeking a foreign partner, and Boeing is heavily involved with aerospace companies in Japan.

HEADLINE: Pemex: Mexico's Hesitant Oil Giant

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
After decades of isolation from foreign influence, Petroleos Mexicanos is reaching out for all sorts of help from foreigners as it tries to make itself into a modern oil giant in the image of an Exxon or a Shell. But the transformation has run into an unusual self-imposed barrier that is sidelining the company as a major source of new export revenue for a nation that badly needs to earn more dollars.
Pemex, as the state-owned company is known, is offering petrochemical plants for sale to foreigners, hiring American companies to drill wells, shedding tens of thousands of workers and selling off many secondary operations like those making valves, pumps and ships. And it has even come close to doing the unthinkable under Mexican law: pledging oil as collateral for foreign loans -- a practice outlawed after Mexico nationalized the industry in 1938.
 
No Export Expansion
 In Mexico's grand vision, the most important goal is to increase exports of manufactured goods greatly to pay for a huge influx of American products. Until that happens, Pemex remains the nation's biggest export earner, bringing in 30 percent of all the dollars that Mexico received in 1992 from its sales abroad. 
 But ask Pemex officials what they are doing to increase production and sell more oil to foreigners -- thus helping to keep the nation's finances afloat -- and the answer comes back that Pemex has no intention of raising exports.
"We do not want a policy of greatly expanding production, or anything like that," Francisco Rojas, general director of Pemex, said in an interview, setting forth a policy not so bluntly stated before by a high Government official. "For the moment," Mr. Rojas added, "the official policy that has been defined for Petroleos Mexicanos is to produce enough oil to supply the internal market while maintaining exports at their present level."
Pemex has been an instrument of Mexican policy from its birth in the late 1930's, after the Government threw out foreign oil companies as exploiters and made Mexican oil -- finding it, pumping it, refining it and distributing it -- a state enterprise. Currently, Mr. Rojas said, the Government does not want to make Mexico overly dependent on oil revenue, as it was in the early 1980's, when oil prices collapsed and foreign debts went unpaid.
But others argue that Mr. Rojas's statements are disingenuous, masking the real problem: Pemex lacks the skill and technology to expand oil production and exports, even if it wants to do so. "Maybe he is making a virtue out of a necessity," said George Baker, an oil consultant in Los Angeles and an expert on Mexico.
What's more, for all of Pemex's reaching out to foreigners for help, the Constitution and Mexican law prevent it from offering the one reward that would draw heavy investment and technology from American oil companies. The companies would come, they have made clear, if the payoff for their risk is a share of the oil they find and produce.
"Over the short term, if Mexico wants to maintain strong economic growth, it must have more oil exports to pay for the imports that are needed to industrialize the country," said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an economic consultant and one of the growing number of Mexicans who argue that the oil rules born in the 1930's have outlived their original justification.
The rules are in fact beginning to erode, even without a public break with the past. Foreign lenders, for example, will hold title to a refinery soon to be built in Salina Cruz that will be operated by Pemex, as Mexican law specifies, but not owned by it until the $1.4 billion construction loan is repaid. And by early March, foreigners will lend $300 million to Pemex under a new procedure, supervised by Citibank, that comes closer than in the past to pledging Mexican oil as collateral, Pemex officials acknowledge. Mexican law prohibits such pledges.
"This will be the first refinery within Mexico not owned by Pemex," said Ernesto Marcos, the company's chief financial officer, referring to the proposed refinery in Salina Cruz. "But there are 40 or 50 offshore oil platforms that we rent, just as we will rent the refinery until we own it. We have always done this, but we are doing it much more now."
Reaching out for help seems inevitable for a company that is trying to modernize. That takes investment capital, and Pemex has been left with very little after annually paying over half of its revenue to the Government to finance the federal budget. Last year, for example, Pemex took in nearly $25 billion from sales, but the Government drew from the state oil company more than $15 billion, or 20 percent of all federal revenues.
 
U.S. Oil's Approach
 Very little remains after such taxes for modernization, exploration and new refineries. One way to raise more revenue would be to drop the remaining restrictions on foreigners, the approach advocated by American oil industry officials. Having sold off many state companies and having endlessly promoted private enterprise as the engine of Mexico's economic growth, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari should now extend his philosophy to the oil industry -- offering oil as payment to foreign companies for risky investments, American oil officials say.
The American industry has often raised the hope of greatly increased Mexican exports -- they now account for 7 percent of total American oil purchases -- to make the United States less dependent on Middle East oil. Pemex production is 2.67 million barrels a day, of which 1.4 million barrels is exported, half of it to the United States. Maintaining this level and keeping pace with domestic consumption requires a production increase in 1993 of only 40,000 to 50,000 barrels a day, Mr. Rojas said.
Without more oil export revenue, Pemex is finding other ways to raise money abroad, taking on more than $800 million in net new debt last year, and bringing the total foreign indebtedness to $7.2 billion by December, Mr. Marcos said. Inevitably, some of the deals skirt the constitution.
A trust being set up by Citibank, for example, has sold $300 million in bonds, the money to be lent to Pemex. The collateral will be the payments that creditworthy companies like Exxon, Shell and Amoco will make, starting in March, for 21,000 barrels in daily oil shipments. Normally, these payments would go directly to Pemex, rather than to a trust that will then turn them over to Pemex.
"Pemex is not the debtor, the trust is," Mr. Marcos said, explaining that a bondholder cannot seize oil if his bonds are not repaid.
 
Consequences for Economy
 The Pemex policy of not increasing exports has major consequences for the Mexican economy. American goods and money are flooding into this country and Mexico's trade deficit is rising.
One way to shrink this deficit is to sharply increase oil exports, which now account for 30 percent of Mexico's total annual sales abroad.
But Mr. Rojas argues that the oil solution would make Mexico too dependent on oil revenue from abroad. That was the case in the early 1980's, when a steep drop in oil prices devastated the Mexican economy. Now, the Salinas Government is taking a different gamble -- that exports of manufactured goods, particularly from the many American companies setting up shop here, will rise soon enough and in large enough quantities to shrink the trade and current account deficit.
"I believe that everyone in Mexico would be very content if oil's relation to the total economy declined," Mr. Rojas said.
Meantime, Pemex has freed up revenue by cutting costs, the most important cut being a reduction in workers in recent years to 124,000 from 210,000.
And faced with too little refinery capacity, Pemex is completing an agreement with the Shell Oil Company to refine some Mexican crude in the United States. Still, Mr. Rojas is uneasy. The company has earmarked $3 billion this year to increase oil production, he said, but "if I could dispose of resources as I saw fit, perhaps we would decide to spend $1 billion more."
And what would he do with the extra $1 billion? "We could for example build the new refinery" in Salina Cruz, he said, without borrowing so much for it. And some of the money might be used "to increase our oil reserves."

HEADLINE: In a Victory for Clinton, the Senate Votes to Extend Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
Democrats defeated the first Republican challenge to President Clinton's economic program in the Senate today. They held ranks against a proposal that would have offset the cost of extending unemployment benefits with spending cuts.
The 57-to-43 vote along party lines came after the Senate Democratic leadership held its conservative members in line by presenting the issue as a test of their loyalty to the new President and his economic policies. 
 Senior Democrats said the results were a sign that they will be able to deliver the votes necessary to pass the rest of Mr. Clinton's program. The defeat left Republicans openly frustrated at not being able to slow the Administration's momentum, which they contend is based on a popular misconception that the Democrats are as interested in cutting spending as they are in raising taxes.
Still, there will be several more major votes on spending cuts as well as on taxes on energy and Social Security in the next few months, and those votes may prove more difficult for the Democratic leaders to hold onto the conservative Democrats.
 
Benefits Through Oct. 2
 The Senate passed the benefits extension 66 to 33, with 10 Republicans joining 56 Democrats in support. But the crucial vote was not on that issue but on the Republican proposal to require the Government to cut jobs and other administrative costs to offset the cost of the extension.
The unemployment compensation bill extends benefits through Oct. 2 for 1.8 million Americans who have lost their jobs involuntarily. Under the bill, such workers receive either 20 or 26 weeks of Federal benefits once they exhaust state benefits. The average benefit is valued at $173 a week. The House already passed the measure, and Mr. Clinton has promised to sign it.
The previous three extensions over the past year and a half were paid for by tax increases and accounting gimmicks to avoid increasing the budget deficit. The current extension will increase the deficit by $5.8 billion over two years.
"I find it discouraging," said Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, "that in their first vote out of the box the Democrats, who have talked this strong line about the deficit, say, 'Let our children pay for this $5 billion program.' The bad old ways have not disappeared."
 
Democrats Unite
 No conservative Democrat spoke against the Republican amendment, which called for an acceleration of many of Mr. Clinton's own proposals to streamline the Federal government to pay for the extension.
Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, said after the vote that he and two or three other conservative Democrats discussed the possibility of voting for the Republican amendment. But when Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, rose to the floor and said, "Those who vote for this amendment are voting to torpedo the president's economic program," the conservatives held the line, Senator DeConcini said, because they concluded that the Republicans were merely trying to embarrass Mr. Clinton.
"I spoke to my Democratic conservative colleagues, and said I'm not going to get sucked into this one this early on," Mr. DeConcini recalled. "We want to be with Clinton and we want him to do well, even though some of us still have problems with the taxes and how we insure that the deficit really comes down."
The vote offered Republicans a prime opportunity to drive their argument that Mr. Clinton offers little more than lip service to the cause of cutting the budget deficit. Opinion polls and tallies of constituent phone calls indicate that voter concern over the debt and deficit spending has increased since the extension votes last year.
"Never have I served in a year when cutting spending before we increase taxes has been more in vogue," noted Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas. "We ought to bring some of the President's savings that he wants to implement on Oct. 1 forward to the present to pay for this extension of unemployment benefits."

HEADLINE: THE TWIN TOWERS;
Port Authority Is Unaffected In Bond Sale

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Reflecting continued investor confidence in the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey despite Friday's bombing at the World Trade Center, the authority yesterday sold $100 million in new bonds without having to pay higher interest than other large tax-exempt issuers.
The sale, which had been scheduled weeks ago, had been eagerly anticipated this week to gauge Wall Street's feelings about the financial outlook for the Port Authority, which relies heavily on its ability to sell bonds to finance its operations. 
 If major investors had feared serious long-term financial problems, the Port Authority would have been forced to pay a premium in the form of higher interest rates.
But demand for the bonds was more robust than expected, and analysts said the interest costs paid by the Port Authority was no higher than it would have been before last Friday's bombing.
"In the aftermath of the World Trade Center disaster, I think the yield was less than the Port Authority expected to pay," said Paul Kuhns, a director in the municipal markets division of Merrill Lynch and Company, which submitted the winning bid for all of the $100 million in bonds, paying 5.440 percent interest. He described bidding for the bonds as "very aggressive."
 
No Change in Ratings
 The auction came a day after the nation's two largest credit-rating concerns, Standard & Poor's and Moody's, issued reports saying that they had not changed the authority's rating because of the bombing.
Both agencies said the Port Authority was certain to sustain losses running far into the millions of dollars.
But because of its vast financial resources, both said they expected the agency to cover its losses without having to raise tolls, cut services or sharply increase its debts.
"It appears unlikely that total losses associated with the tragedy would seriously jeopardize the authority's ability to pay debt service," said Standard & Poor's.
Port Authority officials said this week that it has insurance covering $600 million in losses. Even if it takes as long as a month to reopen the two towers of the World Trade Center, that amount of insurance should be enough, according to Moody's.

Suburbs' Hidden Homeless

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMITYVILLE, L.I.

 BODY:
The owner of AP Auto Sales has reduced the number of Long Island's unsheltered homeless by one. Tony Puglisi gives Eugene Nagy a place to sleep on an old sofa in a blue van parked in the used-car lot and the chance to wash up and cook in an office there. In return, Mr. Nagy volunteers to do the occasional chore around the lot, washing cars or cleaning the yard.
But Mr. Puglisi says Mr. Nagy's presence on his property has cost him his village business license and put him at odds with town officials. "I'm here 25 years and now the town officials came and said we couldn't get a license because I've got him in a little van," he said. "I have to hide him."
 
The Official Position
 Amityville officials say the issue is building codes and zoning, not social policy. "We've got to have some control," said the Village Administrator, Bruce MacGill. "If somebody brought a homeless person into their home that would be O.K., but this is a main thoroughfare in a business district." 
 If there is indifference to the homeless in big cities because of their number, there is ambivalence in the suburbs, where people are torn between the desire to help the down and out and the impulse to hide them from view.
J. Jeff McConnell, a sociologist at the Institute for Social Analysis at State University of New York at Stony Brook who has studied Long Island's hidden homeless population, said there is an unspoken contract between communities and their homeless residents: Shopkeepers, town officials and the police will usually tolerate and even help homeless people as long as they stay away from the central business districts and sleep in areas where they are invisible to the casual observer, allowing affluent or heavily traveled areas to maintain their image.
"It's understood that you get by a lot better if you don't panhandle" or otherwise challenge suburbia's self-image, said Mr. McConnell, who said there were shopkeepers in several Long Island towns who allow one or two homeless people to sleep in their basements or in cars parked in their lots.
 
Compassion and Denial
 On Long Island, the suburban landscape obscures the problem in areas where homeless people who do not enter the shelter system live just out of view in cars, abandoned houses, or when weather permits, camped in wooded or beachfront areas. But in areas where affordable rentals are scarce, both compassion and denial seem to be on the upswing.
"The calls we get from the community are mixed," said Jill Winter, executive director of the Huntington Coalition for the Homeless. "We get true concern, and we get 'Get them off the street.' They can handle seeing it at Penn Station, but they don't want to see it on Main Street, U.S.A. We sometimes live with illusions, and on Long Island and in Westchester it's easier to hide behind the trees, so people can walk away a little more comfortably in suburbia."
 
Observing the Boundaries
 In Port Jefferson two men living in an abandoned house with no heat and a collapsed porch said they were well aware of the boundaries that must be observed.
"The police come by here two or three times a week to see if anything's going on and as long as nobody complains, they don't bother us," said John Macleod, 32, an unemployed drywall contractor who said his business failed two years ago.
Conditions in the house are wretched. The people who stay there usually sleep with pipes in hand to bat the rats away, and a trail of dried blood in one room marks the spot where one man tried to commit suicide last week. But Mr. Macleod said he would rather live there than in the "crack house welfare places" offered him by the county.
 
Bowling Alley Is a Refuge
 He said he was able to get by because of the individual kindnesses shown by the owners of a bowling alley, where homeless people congregate as unobtrusively as possible to keep warm on winter days. On unbearably cold nights, he and others sit up in the emergency room at John T. Mather Memorial Hospital. When spring comes, he said, he will move to a nearby beach.
In April, Mr. Nagy, 52, said, he will leave the van parked behind the Amityville car lot and hit the road again with his pushcart, collecting cans by day and staying in wooded areas on his portable folding cot at night.
He said he is hospitalized periodically for mental illness, "but I'm just not sick enough for them to keep me, and I make money canning, but I just can't seem to get enough saved to do anything with."
So for the two years since Mr. Nagy first wandered by with his pushcart and stopped to look at a car, the lot has been his home base.
"He doesn't steal and he's not afraid to work," said Mr. Puglisi. "Who's Eugene bothering?"
Then he tried to answer his own question.
"The town's got a point, too," not wanting people living in vans, he said. "But what am I supposed to do?"

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 3.51 Points, To 3,404.04

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices moved higher yesterday as interest rates continued their declines, making stocks a more attractive investment than bonds.
The Dow Jones industrial average of blue-chip stocks gained 3.51 points to close at 3,404.04. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 277.4 million shares, slightly higher than Tuesday's volume of 275.9 million. Advances led decliners by a ratio of 2 to 1.
 
S.& P. Up 1.36 Points
 The broader market also rose, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index up 1.36 points, to 449.26, just shy of the record close of 449.56 set on Feb. 4.
"The market actually did better than the Dow depicted," said Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment strategist for the First Albany Corporation. "There was meaningful strength in the over-the-counter issues as the Nasdaq composite index rose 6.20 points, to 683.92."
Mr. Johnson also said he had been impressed by the strong trade volume. "It has a tendency to dry up before the release of the monthly employment data, which will be released on Friday," he said. "It appears as though investors are becoming somewhat less cautious."
Helping to underpin some of the strength yesterday were gains in bond prices, which helped the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fall to 6.78 percent. Aside from making bond yields less competitive compared with those of stocks, Mr. Johnson said, lower long-term interest rates "implies that corporations can continue to refinance existing debt, which over time will help earnings."
 
Selloff in Timber Partnerships
 The biggest net loser on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday was Rayonier Timberlands L.P., which lost more than 14 percent of its value, dropping $5.625, to $34.125. The fall followed an article in The New York Times yesterday saying investors buying units of the logging company for their yield would likely lose money in the long term because of the terms of the partnership agreement governing the securities. The selloff spread to IP Timberlands Ltd., another limited partnership in the timber industry, which lost $2.375 to close at $22.625.
Genetic Therapy rose $2.125, to $12.625, after the company said that the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee of the National Institutes of Health had approved two of its human gene trials to treat cystic fibrosis. The Genzyme Corporation rose $1.625, to $35.125. The biotech company reported fourth-quarter earnings of 33 cents a share against 30 cents a year earlier. Chemtrak Inc. rose $2.75, to $15, after the Food and Drug Administration gave the medical supplies company clearance to sell its single-use cholesterol test products in the United States.

Vehicle Sales Rise 9% But Annual Rate Dips

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 3

 BODY:
Sales of North American-built vehicles rose 9 percent in late February from the levels of a year earlier, auto makers reported today. Still, accounting for seasonal adjustments, the annual rate of car sales slipped to 5.5 million in the period, from 6.5 million in mid-February and 5.9 million a year ago.
Analysts were divided as to whether lagging car sales reflected consumer worries about President Clinton's economic proposals, especially those for higher taxes, which the President disclosed in a speech to the nation on Feb. 17. 
 "The rate shows some initial shock over President Clinton's proposals," said John Casesa, automotive analyst for Wertheim, Schroder & Company in New York. David Healy, of S. G. Warburg & Company, agreed. "He may have scared them out of showrooms for a while," he said.
But Wendy Needham of Smith Barney, Harris Upham said, "If consumers were scared by the proposals, it will take longer than a week or two for the market to show it."
 
 
Car Sales Up 3%
 Car sales in the Feb. 21-28 period rose 3 percent, to 138,278; sales of light trucks, which include mini-vans, pickups and sport-utility vehicles, rose 19.2 percent, to 97,840. Over all, light-vehicle sales were 236,118; there were six selling days in the period, compared with eight last year.
For reporting purposes, all vehicles built in Canada, Mexico and the United States are considered domestically made. For all of February, light-vehicle sales, including imports and domestics, rose 1.5 percent, to 959,343. Car sales fell 6.2 percent, to 597,825, while light-truck sales rose 17.3 percent, to 361,518. There were 24 selling days in February, compared with 25 a year earlier.
"The pace of sales for all of February was lower than December and January," said Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association. "This, plus other less-than-robust economic reports released this week, suggests the recovery, which was only jogging slowly ahead, is already taking a breather."
Nevertheless, the month's results included positive news for the Big Three, which raised their share of the market to 73 percent, from 69.7 percent a year earlier. Roger Wagner, general sales manager of Bell Dodge in Tucson, Ariz., said demand had been strong for the new Dodge Intrepid. The Dodge Dynasty, a model that will soon be discontinued, had also sold well, he said, "because there are such good incentives on them."
 
 
G.M. Loses Market Share
 But the biggest American auto maker, the General Motors Corporation, lost part of its share of the market in February. G.M.'s total car sales for the month were 197,297, down 14 percent. G.M.'s light-truck sales rose 16.5 percent, to 117,397.
The Ford Motor Company posted a 6.6 percent increase in car sales, to 143,999. Ford's light-truck sales rose 19.7 percent, to 112,505.
The Chrysler Corporation sold 60,425 cars, an increase of 22.2 percent from February 1992. Last year, the Honda Motor Company and the Toyota Motor Corporation each sold more cars than Chrysler in February; this year, Chrysler regained the lead. Chrysler's light-truck sales were up 19.8 percent, to 82,946.
Honda's car sales fell 18 percent, to 45,319. Toyota's car sales fell 11.1 percent, to 54,329; Toyota had a threefold increase in light-truck sales, to 7,161. The Nissan Motor Company's car sales for the month rose 6.3 percent, to 28,804; Nissan's light-truck sales fell 1.5 percent, to 9,831.
Mr. Casesa, noting the weaker monthly sales for most Japanese auto makers, said: "The Japanese companies have raised prices more aggressively than the domestics, and the gap is having an effect. Detroit's vehicles look like a fantastic value next to those from Japan."

Dollar Is Mixed as Traders Await Bonn's Rate Decision

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mixed in uneventful dealings yesterday as activity wound down ahead of a key meeting of German monetary officials.
Gold prices also ended mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $329.80 a troy ounce, unchanged from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped 60 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $328.80. 
 The dollar gained against the German mark amid renewed speculation that the Bundesbank would lower interest rates. The central bank's policy-setting council is scheduled to meet today.
Much of the day's activity involved trading between currencies other than the dollar, said Michael Malpede, an analyst with Refco Group Ltd. in Chicago. For example, the pound also benefited from anticipation of lower German rates and rose against the dollar.
 
Yen Strengthens
 The Japanese yen continued to strengthen in technical trading. Mr. Malpede noted that the first half of the Japanese fiscal year draws to a close at the end of the month, and some companies may be starting to convert profits earned abroad into yen to square up their books.
Analysts also said trading was light ahead of tomorrow's Labor Department report on unemployment during February.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 116.75 yen, down 1.75 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 117.08 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 116.65 yen, down from 117.73 yen on Tuesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.4505, from $1.4480 late Tuesday. In New York, it cost $1.4510 to buy one pound, more expensive than Tuesday's $1.4485.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.6460 German marks, up from 1.6400; 1.5235 Swiss francs, up from 1.5225; 5.5860 French francs, up from 5.5640; 1,565.00 Italian lire, up from 1,562.00, and 1.2423 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2468.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $329.45 a troy ounce, compared with $330.10 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $329.30 from $328.70. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 87 cents to close at $330.67.

TIFFANY & CO. (N)

 BODY:
A plunge in revenues from Japan and rising expansion costs caused a 38 percent drop in net income at Tiffany & Company in the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31, the company said yesterday.
The disappointing results at the jewelry and specialty retailer came amid a slight decline in net sales, to $486.4 million, from $491.9 million theprevious year. 
 William R. Chaney, chairman, said, "Our 1992 results benefited from healthy retail sales increases to local U.S. consumers, but we felt the impact of cautious consumer spending tied to worldwide economic conditions and the large decline in our sales to Japan." International sales fell 15 percent in the latest year, while sales in the United States rose 7 percent, the company said.
In the fourth quarter, Tiffany's net income fell to $8.7 million from $12.1 million in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Retail sales in the United States rose 13 percent in the quarter, and domestic direct marketing sales, through catalogues and corporate programs, climbed 12 percent. International retail sales, however, dropped 21 percent in the quarter.

A B.T.U. tax would do the job, but there are still some problems.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IT is no secret why President Clinton opted for a B.T.U. tax over alternative energy levies: The idea is to raise maximum revenue gain with minimum political pain.
But his proposal to tax the heat content of fuels is generating a lot of grousing among environmentalists and economists. While none of their complaints sound like deal-breakers, they will certainly figure in the push and shove of the Congressional lawmaking. 
 Ask any environmentalist for his favorite energy tax and you will hear an earful about carbon. "It is better to tax 'bads' than 'goods,' " argues Robert Repetto of the World Resources Institute -- and in this case, the "bad" is carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels that are warming the atmosphere.
But a tax on carbon is anathema to the coal industry because coal releases about twice as much carbon per unit of energy generated as oil or natural gas. And President Clinton plainly does not want to go to war with the coal lobby's friend in high places, Robert Byrd, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Economists are not as easy to pin down, but a goodly number are drawn to an oil or a gasoline tax. Oil, after all, is the primary source of urban air pollution -- a less overarching "bad," perhaps, than global warming, but a more tangible one.
Add to that the fact that roughly half of America's oil is imported. So any tax that reduces consumption would come in part from the pockets of the sheiks and the ayatollahs: "Even a modest reduction in imports," suggests Morris Adelman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "could disrupt the oil cartel."
The catch, from the White House's perspective, is that oil, too, has an effective domestic lobby. Probably as important, an oil or gasoline tax would have a disproportionately large impact on a handful of states, and would thus be politically divisive at a time when the President can ill-afford defections from the Democratic ranks.
This explains why an "ad valorum" sales tax -- a simple percentage levy on the market prices of all fuels -- was the smart-money choice in the weeks before the Clinton plan was announced. Like a B.T.U. tax, this tax would spread the pain. But Philip Verleger, a fellow at the Institute for International Economics, points to some subtle drawbacks.
The tax would vary in proportion to market prices, adding to the volatility of costs to consumers. This does not bother Mr. Adelman, who has long been partial to a tax that would effectively beat OPEC to the punch in crises, skimming a portion of the inevitable windfall for the Treasury. But it upsets politicians, who are loath to pile misery upon misery when energy prices go up.
Then, too, an ad valorum tax would cost families more than corporations because businesses generally buy their fuel at wholesale rates. This may not be a bad thing: In competitive markets, lower business costs are generally passed through to consumers. But try selling that idea to middle-class Americans, who spent the 1980's waiting in vain for the trickle down.
That leaves the B.T.U. tax -- or rather the Clinton version, which has been modified to tax oil and hydropower more heavily than natural gas or coal in order to level the regional impact. It would do the job, raising $22 billion in 1996. And a classic study by Bruce Hannon and colleagues at the University of Illinois suggests that once the indirect effects on product prices are taken into account, it would hit all income groups equally.
But Mr. Verleger still sees problems. In some cases, he notes, it takes a lot of energy to make energy. Western coal, for example, which must be transported thousands of miles to market on diesel-powered trains, would face a major competitive disadvantage with respect to Appalachian coal. Heavy California oil, which must be forced out of wells with very hot steam, would be at a disadvantage compared with lighter domestic grades and all foreign oil.
Then there is enforcement. Mr. Clinton proposes to soften the blow on residential consumers by excluding heating oil from the tax in the first year. But heating oil is nearly identical to diesel and jet fuels, and monitoring compliance would not be easy.
Mr. Verleger's tax of choice is a hybrid, a combination of a very modest sales tax on all fuels plus a 15-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline. This tax would come even closer than the Administration's tax to the ideal of regional neutrality. It would be relatively easy to enforce. And it would eliminate the competitive disadvantages to digging coal in the West and lifting heavy grades of oil.
But Mr. Verleger is quick to concede that his best could become the enemy of the good. "If it becomes a choice of a flawed B.T.U. tax or no energy tax," he said, "I'll take the B.T.U. tax."

HEADLINE: ON THE SET WITH -- Arnold Schwarzenegger;
Big Guy. Big Star. Big Deal, Baby.

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD

 BODY:
It was just a few days before Arnold Schwarzenegger flew to New York to start filming in the real Times Square. On a chilly morning here, he flung open a door overlooking a glittering replica of the New York scene. Mock rain tumbled out of cylinders overhead. The actor stood, cool, facing a Bad Guy gripping a scythe.
John McTiernan, the director of the movie being filmed, "Last Action Hero," yelled, "Cut!" The rain stopped. Mr. Schwarzenegger, arguably the town's biggest star in more ways than one, shruged and walked from the cameras. 
 A young boy, the son of a crew member, stared at him, speechless. Mr. Schwarzenegger -- everyone in Hollywood calls him Arnold -- opened his hand, palm upward, to the boy.
"Let's have five," he said. "Five high. Five low. Too slow."
The boy laughed. Mr. Schwarzenegger posed for a photo with some young women, his bulging forearms on their shoulders. An assistant director walked over and apologized for the delay.
Mr. Schwarzenegger shouted in mock anger: "I'm sick and tired of the way things are under your leadership!" Everyone laughed, including Mr. Schwarzenegger, who walked to his trailer and lighted a big cigar.
In contrast to other movie stars, Mr. Schwarzenegger, at 45, seems a little less obsessed with his age, his career and his future. Not that he doesn't take them very seriously. But somehow his stardom seems a fluke. And at a minimum of $15 million a picture, he can only shake his head in bewilderment.
"Well, look, most actors take themselves too seriously," he said, blowing smoke rings in his trailer at the Sony Studios in Culver City. "The trick is to take seriously your work, but to be able to laugh at what you do. I don't take any of this so seriously.
"It's no different than me taking bodybuilding seriously," he added. "If somebody talks to me about bodybuilding in a very serious way, I say, 'Hey, wait a minute, what are you talking about?' Let's be honest. It's nonsense. Fifty guys standing around in their little posing trunks with oil slapped on their body. Showing off and posing in front of 5,000 people. It's a joke."
His new film, which has largely been shot in Los Angeles but is shooting in New York until March 16, is something of a fantasy joke. The film is about a movie hero named Jack Slater (played by Mr. Schwarzenegger) and his adventures with a boy who is blasted out of his theater seat into a movie-within-a-movie. To blur the line between reality and fantasy, Mr. Schwarzenegger actually appears briefly as himself, along with his wife, Maria Shriver, at a premiere for the film-within-a-film. The movie also features Art Carney, Charles Dance, F. Murray Abraham, Anthony Quinn and Mercedes Ruehl.
While in New York, Mr. Schwarzenegger follows a typically rigorous regimen. He spends most mornings at World Gym near Lincoln Center. Later, he drops in (accompanied by plenty of photographers) to his favorite restaurant in town, Planet Hollywood on West 57th Street. He happens to own it, along with his pals Bruce Willis, John Hughes and Sylvester Stallone. And in the evening, he goes to Times Square to make his movie.
Mr. Schwarzenegger is not quite in the De Niro or Pacino mode of total absorption into his character.
With a degree in business and economics from the University of Wisconsin, and with an unerring sense of knowing how to sell himself, Mr. Schwarzenegger is on the phone about his production company, Oak Productions (as a bodybuilder he was known as the Austrian oak), his real-estate holdings and his restaurants -- Planet Hollywood (in New York; Newport Beach, Calif., and Cancun, Mexico) and Schatzi in Santa Monica, Calif. He was chairman of President George Bush's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.
In Hollywood, while Mr. Schwarzenegger was making phone calls, Mr. McTiernan, who directed him in the highly successful 1987 film "Predator," sat slumped in his chair, exhausted. Mr. McTiernan had been working 14-hour days, almost seven days a week, for five months, to complete the Columbia Pictures film in time to open in June.
"Kidding himself has always been part of the essence of Arnold's appeal," Mr. McTiernan said. "There's always a wink in what he does. Arnold has a huge ego, but not in the sense that that word is normally used. He's not insecure. He's not threatened. He can let people laugh at him. He's very unusual in that way. He's probably the most rational star I've ever met. He's not really an actor. He has a whole other life. His ego isn't at stake in this."
In the movie-within-a-movie, Mr. Schwarzenegger kids himself remorselessly. "It was Arnold's idea to keep making fun of himself," Mr. McTiernan said. "In one scene, he goes to a premiere with Maria, and she whispers in his ear, while smiling at the cameras, 'Please don't plug the restaurants this time.' It's what she often tells him. And of course, he does it and she yanks him away."
Ms. Shriver, who is pregnant, has visited the set several times with the couple's two daughters, Katherine Eunice, 3, and Christina Aurelia, who is nearly 2.
In his trailer between scenes, Mr. Schwarzenegger sipped a glass of water. He joked with an interviewer whose tape recorder had faltered.
"What is this?" he asked. "You really work for a crummy physical education monthly, don't you?"
Asked about his success, Mr. Schwarzenegger shrugged. "I do movies people like to see," he said. "It's that simple. You try to make sure the movies are memorable. Not just another movie. You've got to have a feeling for hipness. You milk certain lines. 'Hasta la vista, baby,' or, 'I lied.' You go a little over the top. People love it. Kids love it. And you do some athletic stuff, some fitness, and people think you're cool."
He sat a bit like a rajah, making phone calls and chatting with his assistant. There was a knock on the door. It was his nephew, Patrick Knapp, a law student.
The actor fingered the young man's trendy leather jacket. "Red leather," he said. "Very nice feminine touch."
"Thank you," the nephew said, grinning.
Mr. Schwarzenegger straightened his jeans (size 36-34). At 6 feet 1 and 200 pounds, he is, of course, in terrific physical shape.
Told that he not only looks remarkably fit but also seems quite assured at 45, an age when most stars are worried about their age and physique, he laughed. "Why worry?" he said. "I feel better than ever. I look better than ever. It has nothing to do with actors but with people in general.
"I go to the gym every day for probably the last 27 years. I know the characters that come through there. Some of them are worried about every little thing. And some don't give a damn about anything. Some people are continually running around with bottles of water, making sure they continually have a flow of water, so they can clear their bodies and don't get kidney stones. Give me a break.
"People come to me in the gym and say, 'Arnold, I'm so depressed. I was in front of the mirror and saw a wrinkle around my eyes. What should I do?' And I think to myself: 'Why worry? Big deal.'
"Bob Rafelson, the director, said to me years ago: 'Don't do any war movies or Westerns till you're 40, 45, because that's when you start looking interesting. You have good bone structure; it'll get better.'
"I was insulted. I thought, wait a minute, I look great. What's he knocking my face for? But he was so right. Now I understand it. You get to be a certain age -- it's a plus."
Maybe for Mr. Schwarzenegger. Largely because the characters he plays are not especially young, he views his future in movies as following the path of stars who aged elegantly, like Cary Grant.
No star in the last decade has equalled his success. His most recent film, "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," grossed $490 million worldwide. His 1990 movie, "Total Recall," grossed $262 million worldwide. His comedies, including "Twins" and "Kingergarten Cop," were big hits.
Mr. Schwarzenegger made his directorial debut in 1990 with an episode of Home Box Office's "Tales From the Crypt." Recently, he directed a two-hour film, "Christmas in Connecticut," for the Turner Network. It starred Dyan Cannon, Tony Curtis and Kris Kristofferson.
"I love directing," he said. "I like it more than acting. The responsibility you have for everything -- I love it."
An aide knocked on the door and said filming was about to start. Mr. Schwarzenegger was asked about the possibility of a political career. Despite his marriage to a member of the Kennedy family, he is a Republican. He has been mentioned as a potential gubernatorial candidate.
"Why should I run for Governor?" he asked. "Look at the life I have now. I can sit here casually, smoking a cigar. I couldn't do that in the Governor's office. They'd attack me immediately and say I look like a gangster."
Is it complicated for him to be a Republican in the Kennedy family? "No," Mr. Schwarzenegger said as he left his trailer in the midday sun and walked to the same sound stage where "The Wizard of Oz" and "Singing in the Rain" were filmed.
"The trick is to have a sense of humor -- not to take it too seriously," he said. "That's what it's all about. A sense of humor."

Jobless Dick Williams Talks to Steinbrenner

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHOENIX, March 3

 BODY:
Is Dick Williams, a name from George Steinbrenner's past, in the Yankees' future?
Williams, who managed six major league teams but not the Yankees in a 21-year career, was waiting in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel when Steinbrenner arrived for the owners' meeting today. As soon as Williams spotted Steinbrenner, he went outside to greet him, then walked with him to the registration desk in the lobby, waited while Steinbrenner registered, then went up to his room with him. 
 Williams departed about 20 minutes later but didn't say what he and Steinbrenner had talked about. The 64-year-old Williams, who is unemployed after having scouted the Pacific Coast League for the San Diego Padres last season, evidently was seeking a job with the Yankees.
But when Steinbrenner was asked about the visit, he said: "We're old friends. He lives around here. We were talking baseball." Williams, however, lives in Las Vegas, Nev.
Of the multitude of managerial changes Steinbrenner has made, Williams was going to be the first manager he hired after heading a group that bought the Yankees in January 1973. After Ralph Houk resigned as manager at the end of that season, Steinbrenner hired Williams, who had resigned from the two-time World Series champion Oakland Athletics in the middle of a multiyear contract.
But Charles O. Finley, the Athletics' owner, blocked Williams by asking the Yankees for two of their top minor league prospects, Scott McGregor and Otto Velez, as payment for Williams, who was technically still under contract to Finley. Steinbrenner refused and wound up hiring Bill Virdon instead.
Williams last managed the Seattle Mariners, who fired him during the 1988 season.
Only about a dozen reporters were on hand today when Steinbrenner, whose two-and-one-half-year banishment ended on Monday, arrived for his first American League meeting since 1990.
Asked what the American League owners would do at their meeting, Steinbrenner said: "I don't know. I don't know what they're doing."
Steinbrenner apparently didn't know what he was doing either. He was headed into the room where the National League owners were meeting until someone pointed him in the right direction.
"It's been so long," he said.
 
 
'A Good Listener'
 After the two-hour meeting, Steinbrenner, when asked, said, "I was glad to be back. I thought it was a good meeting. I was a good listener today."
Bobby Brown, the American League president, said he did not make a point of recognizing Steinbrenner's return at the start of the meeting.
"I think everybody individually made the appropriate greetings," Brown said. "He was welcomed with a great deal of cordiality. He participated in the meeting in an intelligent and forthright manner."

HEADLINE: The Mohair Toilet Seat

 BODY:
Washington's subsidy for ranchers who produce wool and mohair exceeds $100 million a year. In a budget of $1.5 trillion, that's peanuts. But like the Pentagon's overpriced toilet seats, it is inexcusable.
President Clinton wants to cap subsidy payments at $50,000 per person per year. That's not good enough. Having dared to take on the ranchers' friends in Congress, he might as well go all the way. It's time to kill this program. 
 Mohair is the silky, soft wool of Angora goats. In recent years its market price has been barely one-third of the subsidy support price. In 1991 the market price was roughly $1.30 per pound, the support price was $4.45, and Washington paid growers the $3-plus difference.
Mr. Clinton says his ceiling would save $212 million in four years. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the five-year saving from outright cancellation would be $760 million.
The subsidy dates from the 1950's, when ranchers sought higher tariff protection from President Eisenhower. He turned them down, but cut them in for a share of the tariff that already applied to wool imports. The gesture was justified as protecting a "strategic" industry -- wool for military uniforms -- but that lame excuse has long since collapsed with the introduction of synthetic materials.
Most American mohair is exported now, but important overseas markets have also shut down -- notably the Soviet Union, China and Iraq -- and the recession has hurt business generally.
The harsh truth, now and 40 years ago, is that this industry cannot survive without government aid. No aid means no livelihood for 15,000 American workers, industry spokesmen say. Disingenuously, they call their Federal crutch an "incentive to produce a quality product."
They also assert that it costs taxpayers nothing because it is paid out of the tariff on wool imports -- 7 cents a pound. That's deceptive, too; the tariff taxes everyone by raising the price of everything made of wool. Its repeal is overdue.
The subsidy survives because of friends like Representatives Kika de la Garza and Charles Stenholm, both Democrats from Texas, where 90 percent of the nation's mohair and 20 percent of its wool are produced. Mr. de la Garza is chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, which writes farm subsidy law, and Mr. Stenholm heads its livestock subcommittee.
The defenders of this subsidy are formidable. But so is the folly they defend. It's time for one last shearing.

HEADLINE: 7 Percent Pentagon Solution

BYLINE: By Jerome Wiesner and Kosta Tsipis; Jerome Wiesner, president emeritus of M.I.T., was science adviser to Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Kosta Tsipis directs M.I.T.'s program in science and technology for international security.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
A new Massachusetts Institute of Technology study shows that President Clinton can save hundreds of billions of dollars by reducing the Pentagon budget -- without sacrificing the strength of our military forces.
Helped by a colleague, Philip Morrison, we have found how to save $681 billion (in current dollars) through the year 2000 -- $32 billion in 1993 alone. That is $21 billion more than the cuts suggested by Defense Secretary Les Aspin. The $21 billion is the equivalent of 40 million families each paying $525 less in taxes next year. 
 Since money spent on the defense industry can employ twice as many people in civilian jobs, the cuts we propose would not create net unemployment so long as half the amount saved was spent on civilian projects.
Sixty percent of our military expenses during the cold war went to defend the U.S. and its allies against the Soviet threat. This threat evaporated by 1992, yet the Pentagon plans to spend only 17 percent less in 1997 than it spent in 1992.
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell, invoking the need for "strategic depth," insists America can cut only 2 to 4 percent of military costs a year through 1998 in order to "retain certain capabilities to protect our interests around the world." This vague pronouncement does not justify the size of the military the Pentagon wants.
We recommend cutting the budget about 7 percent a year -- the same rate it was reduced for a few years after the Korean and Vietnam Wars.
During the Cuban missile crisis, America had five aircraft carrier task forces. Now we have 14, each costing $3 billion a year to operate. We need no more than five; two can be decommissioned this year, at a $6 billion net savings at once.
The Army maintains 12 active divisions, the Marines two. In Operation Desert Storm, not quite eight were used. Now that Europe is not threatened, in this fiscal year we can retire one division in Europe and one in America, saving $6 billion.
The Air Force has 95 strategic B-1 bombers and 175 B-52's and is procuring 20 additional B-2's at more than $1 billion each. None of these planes is needed for nuclear deterrence. We should mothball the 81 older B-52's and half the B-1's this year, saving $5 billion. We should stop procuring the not-so stealthy B-2 bomber and the C-17, the flawed new transport plane. We don't need these aircraft because others can perform their functions. Total net savings: $7.3 billion.
Stop procuring the one new Sea Wolf submarine and the four new DDG-51 destroyers, saving $4 billion.
This year, buy half the planned 20 F-18 fighters and 30 Trident-2 missiles for the Navy, saving $1.5 billion.
Cancel the contract for 60 redundant Army Blackhawk helicopters, and reduce by 10 percent the Army's purchase of ammunition and electronics, saving $1 billion.
Curtail the unworkable Strategic Defense Initiative and save $2 billion.
Overall savings from these cutbacks would come to nearly $40 billion, but $8 billion would have to be spent for terminating contracts and mothballing planes and ships. The net savings would be $32 billion in 1993. By the year 2000, the budget can be reduced to $164 billion a year, for a total savings of $681 billion between now and then.
Last month, the Congressional Budget Office, in its publication "Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue Options," identified 61 cuts in the defense budget totaling $308 billion for 1994 through 1998. We suggest $346 billion for that period.
President Clinton can safely order cuts in defense spending, based not on nebulous strategic pronouncements but on a reasonable assessment, to use defense community jargon, of "how much is enough."

HEADLINE: Quit Sniping at Clinton's Fresh, Honest Plan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Jack Kemp is not wrong to point out in "Taxes vs. Growth" (Op-Ed, Feb. 19) that government absorbs too large a percentage of gross national product. But he was a full and willing participant in the Republican-led tax cuts and military buildup that led to our mind-numbing deficit figures, and his protests -- people aren't taxed too little, government spends too much -- sound hypocritical. 
 The Republicans have led this country for 12 years, and their legacy is not lower deficits, smaller government and increased economic power. The blame for our stagnation cannot be pinned on them alone, and Bill Clinton was careful not to do so; but neither can Republicans now moan about cutting programs they wouldn't cut during their tenure in the White House. For all of George Bush's ballyhoo, he never had the courage to submit a belt-tightening budget to Congress. The Democrats like to tax this generation, the Republicans like to borrow from future generations. But no one until now submitted a realistic plan for reducing the deficit.
The most refreshing thing about President Clinton's Feb. 17 State of the Union Message was not his programs but his tone. Fresh, earnest, realistic, honest. By comparison, the tone of Representative Bob Michel, House minority leader, was underhanded and sniping. We have suffered much too long under dysfunctional government, and Congress is at the center of it.
The more I hear people of both parties nibbling at the most realistic reform package of our time, the angrier I get.

The Tax-And-Cut Movement

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"The supply-siders said you could reduce the deficit by cutting taxes," says a veteran Republican observer, "and they were wrong. The Clinton people say you can reduce the deficit without cutting spending, and they are wrong."
Implicit in this both-house-plaguing is a blinding insight that would surely win the Nobel Prize in economics for any iconoclastic genius who dares to put it forward: The crowd-pleasing way to reduce the deficit is to cut spending and raise taxes at the same time. 
 Too complex a thought, you say? You will be joined in your derision of this stunning concept by hordes of liberal economists who say that actually reducing spending now would drag down the economy, aborting the Clinton Recovery and throwing more people out of work.
You will also find conservative allies in hooting down the heresy of tax-and-cut: supply-side economists are still certain that any tax increase would stifle the growth begun last year, which in turn would reduce tax revenues and make the deficit worse.
Under this barrage from both sides, the nascent tax-and-cut movement has agreed to submit its plan for computerized review to produce the prestigious Rightwing Pundits' Politico-Economic Confidence Index (RPPECI).
Let's input the data:
1. Deficit reduction is a political virtue, the motherhood and apple pie of the 90's, replacing the old determination to hold the line on taxes.
2. Taxation is no longer a political sin. President Clinton has transmogrified his promised middle-class tax cut into a $400-a-year-per-family energy tax increase, and sold it by hitting the upper brackets deliciously harder and acting as if he aches to cut the deficit.
3. The economy is clipping along at a 5 percent growth rate, but this is widely seen to be too good to be true, and Democrats want stimulus by spending now and taxing a little later -- while Republicans want to do neither and let the good times pick up steam.
Press [enter]. The lightning conclusion from the prestigious RPECCI: Everybody is finding a good excuse not to reduce the deficit at all yet, and never to reduce it substantially. A secondary, schadenfreudian conclusion: In the politics of contributory sacrifice, there is no greater pleasure than the illusion of shared pain.
O.K.; now the Tax-and-Cut Movement has something solid to work with.
We (and that's an editorial "we"; the Movement has yet to get moving) say that nobody can tell when the perfect moment will come to get serious about reducing the deficit. The activist libs will always say "later, after we fix everything"; Citizen Perot says "someday, I'll run on a plan"; the supply-siders will say "never -- let growth do it."
Our Movement's position: Do it now. This steals the best reduction ideas from both sides and offers Perotism without Perot. What you lose in fiscal stimulus you gain in fiscal predictability. (Many in our Movement come to rallies in fiscal drag.)
We grumble about how Clinton double-crossed us with that "New Democrat" stuff, and is governing far more leftily than he campaigned, but such is politics. Now that he is using deficit reduction as his rallying cry, we should insist he deliver the goods on real deficit reduction.
We say that we want Clinton to succeed, but what we mean is that we want him to succeed using our tax-a-little, cut-a-lot way -- or at least by making his sales pitch his real policy.
Clintonomics as it has been revealed -- "tax and spend and keep on thinking about cutting tomorrow" -- is not our policy. Like the Fed's Alan Greenspan, we prefer that Clinton cut more and tax less, because his high tax rates will bring back all the loopholes and armies of accountants that bend business decisions out of shape.
If the goal is balancing the budget, the Tax-and-Cut Movement thinks the New Direction is off in the wrong direction. We like free markets, not "strategic trade" managed by bureaucrats managed by lobbyists for MITI-style monopolies, or "industrial policy" turning over subsidies to electronic highwaymen.
But the liberals are in, and we cannot expect them to act like conservatives. All the reasonable Right can do is try to cool the new President's hot ideological excesses and remind the singer of the meaning of the words in his song. In time, there will be a demand for change.

Assad's Surprise

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Israeli diplomats told the new and untested U.S. Secretary of State to expect some kind of pleasant surprise in Damascus two weeks ago. President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, ever the seducer and strategist, did not disappoint. He gave Warren Christopher a secret diplomatic gift that could lead to a redrawing of Middle Eastern battle lines and has already caused the U.S., Syria and Israel to revamp negotiating priorities.
The Syrian strongman told the chief U.S. diplomat that he was ready for a major deal with Israel. He repeated public statements about trading "total peace" with Israel for "total withdrawal" by Israel from Syria's Golan Heights. 
 Then he unwrapped his dramatic present. He would no longer insist on instant or even early Israeli withdrawal. He would agree to both sides carrying out their obligations "gradually."
This was precisely the magic word Prime Minister Rabin of Israel had been looking for. He had already signaled his desire to exchange land for peace. But the security risk had to be manageable. Israel could not and would not take the chance of withdrawing from the Golan until Syria actually demonstrated peaceful intentions. And that would have to take time. Israel would feel safe only if it could bring its forces down from the heights gradually.
That word was a major breakthrough but obviously did not resolve all the knotty bargaining problems. The sides still have to define "gradually." More important, they have to agree on the meanings of "total withdrawal" and "total peace." Israel is prepared for a near-total pullout, not a total one. Syria wants everything out, including Israel's civilian settlements.
Mr. Assad's diplo-blitz surprised the Christopher party. They had expected him to wait longer before making any big moves, in order to assess President Clinton's mettle. But the Syrian's agreeableness on the Golan and willingness to abandon unreasonable Palestinian demands convinced the Americans that he had even larger purposes in mind.
The subtext in the Assad-Christopher dialogue was that Damascus wants to establish a new relationship with Washington and felt this was the right time to move. Mr. Assad knows that the only way to the American heart is through peace with Israel.
Mr. Rabin was, of course, delighted with Mr. Christopher's report of Syrian gradualism. Given the Prime Minister's intense personal commitment to a treaty with Syria, the Americans feared he might be too delighted -- and try to sidetrack the autonomy talks with the Palestinians.
If anything, however, Mr. Christopher ended up more frustrated with the Palestinians than Mr. Rabin was. In his meeting with Palestinian leaders he showed great impatience with their inability to make any decisions.
They only wanted to talk about the return of their brethren deported by Israel and stranded in a Lebanese no man's land. Israel had already gone far to meet those concerns. But they kept demanding concessions they knew Israel could not and would not give. Finally, Mr. Christopher offered a generous solution -- including U.S. pledges to speed up the deportees' return, oppose future deportations and support various U.N. resolutions prized by the Palestinians -- and told them to take it or leave it.
The immediate upshot of the Christopher Mideast tour was that the key parties agreed to switch negotiating priorities. They are now readying the fast track for a Syrian-Israeli deal and have relegated the tedious but still critical talks on Palestinian autonomy to a slower lane.
Arabs and Israelis alike praised Mr. Christopher's first outing on terrain that has proved either a graveyard or a springboard for his recent predecessors. He gave away nothing to the Syrians, was tough with the Palestinians and prodded the Israelis. His only tactical mistake was a failure to pay enough attention to Shimon Peres, the Israeli Foreign Minister, whose power now rivals or exceeds Mr. Rabin's in the ruling Labor Party and whose ideas on regional issues like economic development and arms control deserve a better hearing.
Mr. Christopher has begun to reveal a wily negotiating and public relations style. Taking a page from Henry Kissinger's script on how to lower expectations, he started his Mideast trip saying that he was going out there only to listen. He brought home the possibility of much more.

HEADLINE: THE TWIN TOWERS;
3 Potential Tenants Reconsidering Move To the Trade Center

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Three companies that had planned to move into large offices in the World Trade Center before the explosion last Friday are now reconsidering the move. The three companies had been negotiating for a total of 690,000 square feet, equivalent to 10 to 15 floors of office space.
The companies -- Rollins Hudig Hall, Bank of America and Fiduciary Trust -- have now postponed those deals, while a construction consultant that was separately hired by all three, Bennis & Reissman, double-checks the Port Authority's own assessment of how long it will take to make the twin towers safe and functional. 
 Robert Bennis, a principal of Bennis & Reissman, said he found nothing "detrimental to eventual occupancy," but he was far less upbeat about timing. "I think a month is optimistic for opening these buildings," he said.
 
Customizing and Other Worries
 Rollins Hudig Hall was preparing to sublease floors 102 to 105 from Shearson Lehman Brothers, and Bank of America and Fiduciary Trust were negotiating directly with the Center.
Officials from the companies would not comment on their plans, but brokers involved with the deals say that they are questioning whether they will have enough time to customize the space by the time they need it and whether their employees will feel comfortable moving to the towers.
Port Authority officials say it may be a month or more before the buildings are reopened. In addition, there are indications that some present tenants -- including the Federal Home Loan Bank -- are considering not renewing their leases.
A lengthy closing would worsen the problems of the 350 banks, brokerage firms and other tenants of the Center that were shut out by the bombing.
Yesterday, as the Port Authority tried to reassure tenants that the buildings would reopen soon and that they would be safe, landlords and real-estate brokers were rushing to fill some of the acres of vacant office space in lower Manhattan with World Trade Center tenants.
They couched their efforts in terms of offering help, some even making space available rent-free for displaced tenants. But they readily concede that they expect to turn a fair part of their temporary guests into permanent residents. And they are already having a measure of success persuading companies not to move into the center, or to move out after their leases expire.
Numerous brokers are trying to pull off 11th-hour deals with tenants that had almost decided to move into the center.
The brokers' efforts are a major concern to the Port Authority, which gets 15 percent of its annual revenues from the World Trade Center. It is also a concern to city officials who fear some tenants, or prospective tenants, will be wooed away from New York. The city has estimated that companies and government agencies could lose $692 million if the Center were closed for just a week, and $1.07 billion if the buildings were closed for a month.
 
Fourth of District Vacant
 At the same time, the commercial real-estate industry has been among the hardest-hit victims of the stubborn recession, and the temptation to exploit the center's troubles is intense. According to the Real Estate Board of New York, there are 22 million square feet of vacant office space in lower Manhattan, more than a quarter of the total office space. Asking rents have not risen much above $28 per square foot annually, down from the high $30's less than four years ago. World Trade Center rents range about $25 to $45.
At a briefing yesterday morning, Anthony E. Shorris, the first deputy executive director of the Port Authority, played down the chances of tenant flight. "I have yet to find a tenant who wants to move out," he said.
Discussing the renovation and repair plans, Mr. Shorris said: "I don't think anyone will believe the building is not a safe one. The building that people left on Friday is not the one that people will come back to in a month."
As word of the three interrupted deals hit the street, city officials met with representatives of the companies to forestall any chance that they would leave the city. And agents of other Manhattan buildings began calling those and other companies that were negotiating with the center, trying to get them to reconsider.
 
Calls From Rival Buildings
 "Everyone is getting calls from people in also-ran buildings, trying to reopen negotiations," said Mary Ann Tighe, executive managing director of Edward S. Gordon Company, a major commercial brokerage firm.
Some already claim success. Karla Kudatzky, an agent with Galbreath Riverbank who manages 90 West Street, says she is "99 percent certain" that a center tenant she has been chasing for a year is going to take the 14th floor of her building, even though it has a year to go on its Trade Center lease.
One broker close to the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York said the institution was undecided between renewing its lease at the top of One World Trade Center, or moving to 7 World Trade Center, a non-Port Authority building nearby. Then Friday's explosion happened; the bank signed with Building 7. "That explosion tipped the balance," the broker said. Officials of the bank could not be reached for comment last night.
Similarly, Michael Myers, president of Newmark Equity Advisory Group, had been trying to relocate a foreign embassy from the center to midtown for months. After the explosion, the country's ambassador called and approved the deal. "He said the embassy employees just no longer felt comfortable in the center," Mr. Myers said.
 
Rents Not Seen Rising
 The uncertainty about the towers has not yet pushed rents up yet in other buildings. In fact, yesterday the Real Estate Board announced that many of its members, including such large property owners as Olympia & York, the Rudin Management Company, the Mendik Company, and Jack Resnick & Sons, had offered to make a total of 3 million square feet of space available to displaced tenants, for the cost of electricity, taxes and cleaning, for about a month. Several brokerages have also offered to match needy tenants with vacant office space, without charging commissions.
Still, amid the benevolence is a good deal of opportunism, but it might not be fatal to the Port Authority. No landlords expect that the World Trade Center is permanently out of the running for tenants. And they are being careful not to burn bridges, either with such powerful neighbors or with the city, which has asked the industry to help out.
Moreover, some buildings may find that the ripple effect from the explosion is not all to their benefit. Tenants are now more likely to look closely at other buildings' security systems and fire safety systems, which may not appear any better than the center's.
Most experts say that the ultimate number of permanent defectors from the trade center can be controlled by the Port Authority. "If they assess the damage and fix it properly, people will want to stay," said Raymond T. O'Keefe, an executive director of Edward S. Gordon.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 5, 1993, Friday / March 27, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about the effect of the explosion at the World Trade Center on prospective tenants described negotiations between the Fiduciary Trust Company and the Port Authority incorrectly. Fiduciary Trust, which occupies four floors at the Center, has been negotiating a renewal of that space and expansion to a fifth floor. Its chairman, Lawrence Huntington, said yesterday that although Fiduciary has retained an engineering firm to assess damage to the premises, he still expected to sign a long-term lease and stay at the Center.
An article on March 4 about the World Trade Center explosion referred incorrectly to relocation discussions by one tenant, the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. The bank is considering a move from the center, but has made no decision.

BYLINE: By Robert Stone; Robert Stone is author, most recently, of "Outerbridge Reach."

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
Put yourself in the mind's eye of the bomber. Whoever he is, it's likely he first viewed the city from the air, looked out and saw the twin towers mirroring each other's dizzying rise. Or maybe he stood at the window of a safe house in Queens or New Jersey and looked at them thrusting so immodestly over a thousand feet in the air; no doubt he thought they mocked his passionate intensity.
The World Trade Center towers don't have much poetry in them. It might be harder, psychologically, to bomb one of the old cathedrals of commerce like the Empire State or the Chrysler Building. These seem to to aspire beyond mammon. Belonging to a bygone era, they no longer challenge the world. The Michelin Guide to New York describes them in virtually archeological terms. 
 The twin towers were built for an age that will probably never come to pass. They represent an ultimate reduction of the American Dream: America as home of the unadorned Economic Man -- practical, rational, powerful, even brutal. They are the expression of an aspect of America our true-believing enemies have learned to hate and fear.
Now, as America's influence contracts, the world returns to old romances. In Europe, blood and soil are back. In what is sometimes still called the third world, religion flourishes. In our radical interpretation of democracy, our rejection of elites, our well-nigh demagogic respect for the opinions of the unlearned, we are alone.
Our country has been so long identified with its wealth and power that a sense seems to be growing abroad that it will eventually somehow disappear, as though we were no more than our own compulsive communicating, a media phenomenon, a pop artifact going out of style.
Although every President since Franklin D. Roosevelt has denied it, we did set out, years ago, to be the world's policeman. The image was of Uncle Sam rolling up his sleeves and wading in to do the right thing. The unheralded corollary was that we might do well by doing it. After all, the original Uncle Sam was a rather shady defense contractor.
On the international scene these days, our trumpets have sounded slightly sour and uncertain. Our pro bono military operations have been conducted with noticeable diffidence. And this has been noticed, in friendly and unfriendly quarters. Cops make enemies. The best cops are good diplomats, which we have not always been. The impression of weakness, even relative weakness, invites predation.
Malcolm X, exercising his customary cruel wit, called the assassination of President John F. Kennedy a case of the "chickens coming home to roost." His allusion was to the murder of President Ngo Dinh Diem of Vietnam in which some felt the U.S. had colluded. The world is much smaller now than even during Malcolm's lifetime. The poor are poorer and more restless. Entire populations are on the move. The migration of the world's poor has been compared to the barbarian migrations of the fifth century A.D. Borders are porous; in jet planes and on rafts, desperate people cross oceans.
Literally and figuratively, our cities have no walls. We have lived for a long time like ancient Rome, relying on far-flung power for defense. To a degree we have claimed exemption from the forces of history. Now, late in "our" century, history is presenting old, half-forgotten bills.
In striking at symbols, terrorists destroy the real lives of American working people, traumatize actual American children. We will learn to cope as other nations have; we are good at coping. Eventually few Americans will remember the country as it was before X-ray machines appeared at airports and in the vestibules of public buildings, before security guards were deployed at every other corporate door.
During the cold war, we lived in fear of nuclear holocaust. Now we know that if a nuclear device ever goes off in an American city it will not likely come launched from some Siberian silo. More probably, it will have been assembled by a few people, perhaps in the guise of immigrants, in that safe house with a view of lower Manhattan. These days, people are dying again for their national or religious identity. The new breed of terrorist may be those whose cause we have offended perhaps by simply being what we are.

HEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE SHUNS BIGGER A.M.A. VOICE IN HEALTH CHANGES

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
The White House rejected a request from the American Medical Association today for a bigger voice in remodeling the nation's health-care system.
Besides the doctors, some consumer groups are complaining that they have been excluded from the formulation of President Clinton's health policy. 
 Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, and other Administration officials said the health-care industry and consumer groups would be able to express their views but would not be allowed to participate directly in the process of sifting proposals to overhaul the nation's vast health-care system.
While welcoming the A.M.A.'s offer on Wednesday to support some of the President's proposals, the officials said they were determined to limit interest groups to a peripheral role. That approach means that these groups will not know enough about the program being assembled to offer specific practical suggestions.
 
No Formal Meetings
 As a result spokesmen and lobbyists for many health-care professionals worry that their concerns will be ignored. Those worries are heightened by the unusual and highly secretive decision-making process devised by the White House for what is likely to be the costliest, most ambitious initiative in domestic policy since the New Deal.
The President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform, led by Hillary Rodham Clinton, includes seven Cabinet officers but has never had a formal meeting.
Instead, 300 to 400 health experts have been brought to the White House by President Clinton to help him devise a plan to submit to Congress by May 1. Many of the experts come from universities; few have close links to professional groups or trade associations.
 
Told Not to Discuss Work
 The experts meet in groups that have been asked to make proposals in specific areas like cost controls, long-term care and mental health. Their identities are treated as a White House secret, and they have been told not to discuss their work.
President Clinton defended the secrecy surrounding the work of his experts today and rejected proposals to open the deliberations to the public.
"That would be like opening the White House at every staff meeting we have," Mr. Clinton said at a photo session with reporters. "We can't do that. I mean, they've got 400 people over there working continuously on thousands of different issues. Nobody ever does that. I mean, we would never -- we can't get anything done."
The secrecy, being challenged in a lawsuit filed here in Federal District Court by two health groups, is remarkable because the work is of intense interest to consumers and Wall Street alike. The health-care industry accounts for a seventh of the nation's economy, employing 8.5 million people.
Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the A.M.A., warned that "any reform of the health-care system will fail without the support of the medical profession."
 
"Don't Know Who's Doing What
 Jonathan Lawniczak, senior health policy analyst at the National Council of Senior Citizens, said, "We don't know who's doing what with whom in the task force."
And Gail E. Shearer, manager of policy analysis at Consumers Union, said the Administration would have difficulty selling its plan unless it listened carefully to ordinary consumers.
The request by the A.M.A. for a bigger voice has focused attention on the unusual process devised by the White House. George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said today that he did not know how many people working on the President's plan were full-time Government employees, special Government employees, paid consultants, volunteers or advisers of some other type.
Mr. Stephanopoulos cited privacy considerations as a reason for not disclosing their names. But interviews with the group's staff members suggest that many are unsure of their precise legal status.
In response to a barrage of questions, Ms. Myers said today, "I don't know what the specifics are and who's paid and who's not paid." Likewise, Mr. Stephanopoulos said, "I don't know that there is any specific budget for the task force per se."
Outside groups like the A.M.A. have been invited to offer their views, and Mrs. Clinton announced today that she would hold four public forums on health care this month, here and in Florida, Iowa and Michigan.
But critics say the Clinton policy may be out of touch with political reality because it is being devised by people with little experience managing health programs or caring for patients.
"The task force staff of 300 to 400 includes many good technicians, academics and economists," said Michael D. Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems, which includes 1,400 hospitals. "But I would have liked to see more people with practical real-world experience involved."
Ira C. Magaziner, manager of day-to-operations, is considered a analyst, but even his friends note that he has never worked for the Government or supervised the drafting of legislation, now his main task.
The task force's organization leaves President and Mrs. Clinton free to denounce doctors, hospital lobbyists and anyone else who criticizes their plan, just as they condemned drug companies for increasing the price of childhood vaccines.
Some liberal groups that criticized Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush for secrecy are holding their fire now, in part because they believe they will like the proposals that emerge from the Clinton White House.
The basic idea of President Clinton's proposal was taken from a blueprint developed over the last few years by a loose-knit group of experts who meet periodically in Jackson Hole, Wyo. This group includes doctors, insurance and drug company executives and hospital officials, many of whom now feel excluded from the all-important decisions about details of the program.
Confidential work papers from Mrs. Clinton's group show that some of the proposals are politically explosive.
The Government will, for example, prescribe a standard package of health benefits that must be offered by all employers to their employees. If the package of benefits for people under 65 years old is less generous than Medicare benefits, then the Government might, as one option, "eliminate current Medicare benefits in excess of the standard package."
"This would reduce Medicare program costs, since fewer services would be covered," said a document prepared by one of the working groups.
The Clinton Administration is also drafting proposals for interim cost controls on all segments of the health-care industry, including doctors, hospitals, dentists, laboratories, optometrists, visiting nurses and prescription drugs. Options include an absolute freeze on price changes and a rollback of prices, with little or no allowance for inflation.
 
'Pseudo Openness'
 In the absence of information about who is designing cost controls for the President Clinton's health-care plan, newsletters have popped up with titles like Health Care Reform Week.
One member of the White House staff, Michael Lux, is in charge of public liaison with outside groups. But people who have met with him said they found the experience frustrating.
After a White House meeting today, Dr. Quentin D. Young, chairman of Physicians for a National Health Program, said, "It was a magnificent exercise in pseudo openness."
Representative William F. Clinger Jr. of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the Government Operations Committee, said the secrecy appeared to violate a 1972 law that says meetings of advisory committees must be open to the public.
The two health groups that filed the suit against Mrs. Clinton last month to try to pry open the work of her panel are the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons and the American Council for Health Care Reform. They contend that the panel is covered by the 1972 law because it includes people who are not full-time officers or employees of the Federal Government. Mrs. Clinton, they note, is not a Federal employee.
The Justice Department maintains that Mrs. Clinton's group is not covered by the 1972 law because the First Lady "is hardly a private citizen or a regular member of the public."
Moreover, the Justice Department says that the business is conducted in more than two dozen working groups, and it says these groups are not covered by the 1972 law because they will never provide recommendations directly to the President. Rather, they will supply advice to Mrs. Clinton.
Finally, the Justice Department argues that if the 1972 law applied, it would interfere with the President's ability to solicit the advice he needs to recommend legislation to Congress.
Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, is also involved in preparing the health plan. But Mr. Stephanopoulos said Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Gore "are clearly not outside advisers in any reasonable interpretation of the law."

HEADLINE: THE TWIN TOWERS: The Investigation;
Insistence on Refund for a Truck Results in an Arrest in Explosion

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
He wanted his money back.
Since last Friday's bombing at the World Trade Center, officials said yesterday, Mohammed A. Salameh returned three times to a Ryder truck-rental dealer in Jersey City for a refund of the $400 cash deposit he had put down on the yellow Ford Econoline van that he said had been stolen the night before the explosion. 
 The last time he came back -- yesterday morning about 10 -- the refund was waiting. But so were Federal agents masquerading as employees, who deducted $200 for the cost of the three-day rental, gave him $200 as a refund and soon arrested Mr. Salameh on charges relating to the massive explosion that killed 5 people and injured more than 1,000 at the twin towers.
Mr. Salameh was in custody last night in Manhattan, and, aside from his contention that the van had been stolen, it was impossible to learn his version of events. At the same time, investigators did not say precisely what role they believe he played in the trade center explosion. But the Federal Bureau of Investigation said bomb-making materials were found at an address listed by Mr. Salameh.
The arrest of Mr. Salameh, who law-enforcement authorities say is a Muslim fundamentalist, provided the most dramatic moment so far in the six-day investigation. And it shifted the focus from a wide array of possible suspects and motives, ranging from combatants in the Bosnian conflict to disgruntled employees, and onto a radical Islamic group that advocates violent revolution against the Egyptian Government.
 
Searching in a Crater
 According to Federal agents, the sequence of events that set off the arrest began late Sunday afternoon, two days after the explosion.
With lower Manhattan barricaded, hospitals overflowing with wounded and jittery officials trying to calm a fearful public, experts from the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the F.B.I. and the police bomb squad dug through mounds of incinerated cars and other debris in the parking garage under the New York Vista Hotel, where the noon-hour blast originated.
Because the huge bomb had cored the garage with a crater spanning seven parking levels, much of the vital evidence, including what remained of the vehicle suspected of delivering the bomb, was believed to be buried under tons of rubble at the bottom.
And top officials, including James M. Fox, an assistant director in charge of the F.B.I.'s New York office, and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, despaired of being quickly able to reach the evidence because of the unstable and unsafe conditions underground.
But on that Sunday, 10 A.T.F. and police experts in zippered blue jackets and carrying flashlights picked their way down the littered ramp from the West Street entrance to the B-2 parking level, looking for mangled fragments that might have come from the blast's center.
They found it quickly -- a long and thin piece of tortured metal that appeared to have been blown apart with particular ferocity. "Hey, look at this," one A.T.F. agent said. Joe Hanlin, another A.T.F. agent, knelt down and picked it up. "This is something we need to take," he said. They turned it over and discovered part of a vehicle identification number, stamped on it at the factory to help find vehicles that are destroyed in accidents, stolen or cannibalized by chop shops.
By that afternoon, the partial number -- enhanced by the F.B.I., according to an agent's sworn complaint to the court -- was put through F.B.I. computers for a "V.I.N. history check," which revealed it as an E-350 Ford Econoline van, yellow, with an Alabama license plate.
By midweek, investigators said, the van had been traced to the Ryder Truck Rental Company, one of the nation's largest leasing chains, and then in turn to a Ryder dealership on the property of Rockview Auto Sales, a used-car lot behind a chain-link fence at 1558 John F. Kennedy Boulevard, in an industrial section of Jersey City, about a mile from the Bayonne city line. The vehicles are owned by Ryder and rented by agents who receive a commission.
F.B.I. agents visited the business Wednesday, said Paul Mascitelli, the owner of Rockview. Mr. Mascitelli and others involved in the business said the agents were given the following account:
On Tuesday, Feb. 23, a slightly built man with dark hair and a neatly trimmed dark beard who was later identified as Mr. Salameh visited the office and rented a yellow Ford Econoline van for a week at the rate of $225 for the week plus 25 cents a mile. In the absence of a credit card, he put down a $400 cash deposit, showed a New York driver's license and drove off.
On Friday afternoon, Feb. 26, about two or three hours after the bombing, Mr. Salameh showed up at the dealership and said the van had been stolen the night before from the parking lot of a Shop Rite supermarket on Route 440, sometimes called "the back highway' in Jersey City, Mr. Mascitelli recounted.
He wanted his $400 back, Mr. Mascitelli remembered. Mr. Mascitelli said he asked Mr. Salameh whether he had reported the theft to the police and was told he had not. Mr. Mascitelli said Mr. Salameh needed to do that before the agency would accept his account of the loss.
"I asked him why he took so long to report it, and he said he didn't know what to do," Mr. Mascitelli said.
Later that evening, according to the F.B.I., Mr. Salameh visited a Jersey City police station and told a desk officer that his rental van had been stolen the night before but he had not reported it because he did not have the license plate or vehicle number.
He returned again on Monday to the rental office and again asked for a refund, Mr. Mascitelli said.
Investigators said that Mr. Salameh also presented a copy of his van-rental agreement, which analysis later showed had traces of nitrates, a chemical associated with explosives.
Mr. Mascitelli said he repeated his need to have a police report, and Mr. Salameh left.
A law-enforcement official said yesterday that Mr. Salameh did file a theft report with the Jersey City police the following day, Tuesday.
 
Visit From F.B.I. Agents
 When the F.B.I. agents visited the dealership on Wednesday around 5 P.M., they heard the story and said they were interested in talking to Mr. Salameh, Mr. Mascitelli recalled.
At the same time, Mr. Fox, the F.B.I. official, sat in his office at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, impatiently nibbling from bags of Granny Smith apples and Thompson seedless grapes. The regular afternoon news briefing by top law enforcement officials at New York City's Police Headquarters had as usual produced many questions from reporters that he and the other offices could not -- or would not -- answer.
"We need a break," Mr. Fox said at one point.
By 8 P.M., Mr. Fox was about to start for home when he was urgently summoned back.
It was then, officials said later, that Mr. Fox and other top investigators learned of the information on Mr. Salameh and grew fearful that the news could leak out, imperiling a plan to tail Mr. Salameh, perhaps to associates.
In fact, officials said, an article in New York Newsday yesterday morning reporting that a van that had been stolen from a Jersey City rental company was involved in the case forced them to change plans. Don Forst, New York editor of Newsday, said that the F.B.I. and the city police knew of the newspaper's plans to publish the article and offered no objections.
 
A Return Visit
 It was not clear under what circumstances Mr. Salameh was asked to return to the leasing office to file the police report, but some investigators and others familiar with the events said the suspect was lured back with a call from the office.
The agents returned yesterday morning about 8 when Mr. Mascitelli opened the office. "We had set it up the night before," he said.
When Mr. Salameh showed up at about 9:45 A.M. one of the agents, posing as a Ryder agent, handled his request. Mr. Salameh was given the $200; the rest was deducted for the rental. The transaction took about 45 minutes, Mr. Mascitelli said.
When he left at about 10:30 A.M. he walked through the lot to Kennedy Boulevard and turned north, walking to a bus stop.
"When it appeared he would board a bus," Mr. Fox said, "he was arrested."
But there was more, the F.B.I. said. Taking note of a New Jersey telephone number that Mr. Salameh had provided on the rental agreement, agents traced the number to a Jersey City apartment registered to a Josie Hadas, at 34 Kensington Avenue.

HEADLINE: THE TWIN TOWERS: The Scene;
Surprises in a Crowded Courtroom

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
At 7:45 P.M. yesterday, Mohammed A. Salameh, gaunt in a light grey sweat suit and white running shoes, entered a courtroom at the United States Court House in Manhattan to stand accused of participating in what the Federal prosecutor, Gilmore Childers, called, "the single most destructive act of terror ever committed on American soil."
The din of 200 reporters, lawyers and clerks quieted to an instant hush as Mr. Salameh rubbed his wrists when his handcuffs were removed. He glanced quickly behind him, searching the packed courtroom, then shrugged. 
 A half-hour into his arraignment, Mr. Salameh, who is 26, stunned the courtroom by instructing his defender, Robert E. Precht, to ask that he be freed on $5 million bail. Mr. Precht also seemed surprised by his client's request.
Minutes before, Judge Richard Owen concluded his reading of the complaint against Mr. Salameh by saying that the defendant should be held without bail "on the ground that he blew up the World Trade Center and killed five people."
Hearing that, as well as that he faced a possible death penalty, Mr. Salameh placed his fingers on his temples, then gesticulated emotionally during a whispered conference with his lawyer.
 
Bail Is Denied
 Mr. Precht, who met Mr. Salameh just before the arraignment, said that his client professed innocence and said that he would be able to put up $50,000 in cash and arrange for 10 financially responsible people to co-sign a personal recognizance bond.
Mr. Precht said that Mr. Salameh was a "devout Muslim" who had lived in this country five years and was faint with hunger from fasting during Ramadan.
Judge Owen denied bail and ordered that the defendant be fed on arrival at the Metropolitan Correctional Center behind the Federal courthouse.
 
Translated Into Arabic
 During the court proceedings, Latif Onsi, an Arabic interpreter who works for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, translated into Mr. Salameh's ear as the judge advised him of his rights and read the charges against him. Ten courtroom artists furiously sketched the defendant's beakish nose, hollow cheeks, cropped beard and the sideways tilt of his head.
The complaint against Mr. Salameh said that on Feb. 23, he rented the Ford Econoline E-50 van with Alabama plates that investigators believe was used in the bombing of the World Trade Center a week ago. It said that Mr. Salameh was caught after he tried to reclaim his rental deposit -- $400 -- saying the van had been stolen. The complaint said that he had even visited a Jersey City police station to report the theft of the van.
The complaint added that dogs trained in detecting explosives "responded positively to a closet space" at the Jersey City apartment listed as Mr. Salameh's home address on the van rental form.
"Whatever that means," Judge Owen said.
 
Crush of Observers
 Mr. Salameh was arrested yesterday morning at the Ryder rental agency in Jersey City and transported to the F.B.I. offices at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan. He requested a lawyer, but spent the afternoon without seeing one, said Mr. Childers, the deputy chief of the criminal division in the Southern District.
Mr. Salameh was not questioned but was "involved in evidentiary testing," Mr. Childers said. He did not elaborate.
About 3 P.M., while Mr. Salameh was with the F.B.I., paralegals, law clerks and reporters began gathering outside Courthouse Room 506. Stephen Hoffman, 25, a paralegal with the Transit Authority had dropped by after delivering papers to the Courthouse.
"I said, 'Why not? I'm here,' " he said. "It's the first big thing that really happened around me since I moved into the city from Long Island."
 
A Wait for Answers
 Allan Pearlman, a motions law clerk for the United States Court of Appeals, said he was willing to wait several hours to get first-hand information about the highest profile case in town.
"We might get more answers here than what William Sessions gave at the press conference," he said.
The wait was particularly long because Mr. Precht, the defender, did not learn until early evening that Mr. Salameh was his client. He reserved time to meet with him and explain the complaint against him.
The courtroom was impatient but not tense. Rebekah Boyer, a courtroom artist, said it had peripherally occurred to her that the hearing itself could be the target of terrorists.
"But basically I don't feel nervous that I'm going to be bombed," she said, "because I tend to show a real lack of imagination."

HEADLINE: Factories See Decline in Orders

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
New orders for manufactured goods dropped sharply in January, the Government said today, while the number of people applying for unemployment benefits jumped late in February.
Economists said that the two measures of economic activity, although not cause for alarm, suggested a slowdown in the recovery's pace. 
 A big drop in demand for new aircraft helped pull factory orders down 1.3 percent in January, to a seasonally adjusted $254.9 billion. It was the sharpest fall in monthly business since a 2.2 percent drop last August, the Commerce Department said. But it did not erase completely December's 6.1 percent rise in orders.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said the number of applicants for state unemployment benefits climbed by 26,000 in the third week of February from the previous week, to 351,000. That was still 100,000 lower than the average rate of applications a year earlier.
A further indication of employment trends will come Friday, with the release of jobless data for February.
 
A 'Moderating Economy'
 "The overall picture is one of a moderating economy," said Lynn Reaser, an economist with the First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles.
The economy, still recovering from the 1990-91 recession, expanded by a strong 4.8 percent annual rate in the final three months of 1992, its most vigorous performance in five years.
Ms. Reaser, however, estimated that the nation's gross domestic product, which measures all goods and services produced, was growing at only a 2.9 percent rate in the first quarter.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York, said the weakening in the economy grew more pronounced last month. "In addition to the recent increase in initial unemployment claims, car sales plunged and consumer confidence fell," Ms. Schaja noted.
Weak job growth is a major concern cited by the Clinton Administration in its proposals to stimulate the economy in the short run and cut the deficit over the longer term.
By one measure in the Labor Department's weekly report -- the four-week moving average for initial claims that irons out seasonal fluctuations and holidays -- the job situation was about flat or slightly better in February.
It showed jobless claims on average inched down to 334,250 in the week that ended Feb. 20 from 334,500 the previous week.
But Ms. Reaser noted that job creation was a more significant gauge of economic health and that it continued to be sluggish. The number of jobs created monthly in 1993 will likely average 130,000, an improvement from 50,000 a year ago but far below the 300,000 a month in most post-World War II recoveries, she said.
There were some positive signs in the factory orders report.
Manufacturing inventories fell for a fifth straight month in January to $378.03 billion and were at the lowest level since March 1989, when they were worth $375.45 billion. The low level of stocks of unsold goods suggests companies may soon need to increase production to meet demand.
The factory orders report also showed orders for transportation equipment dropped by 8.5 percent in January, after a 24.6 percent surge in December. Within that category, aircraft, missiles and parts orders plunged by 32.3 percent, after a 62.9 percent December jump.
Excluding transportation, factory orders fell only one-tenth of 1 percent in January, after increasing in December by 3.6 percent.

HEADLINE: THE TWIN TOWERS: The Clues;
Vital Evidence in Towers Bombing Found Early in the Investigation

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
It was late Sunday afternoon, Feb. 28, when the team of 10 investigators first moved cautiously into the blast area beneath the World Trade Center, looking for clues to what might have caused the deadly explosion two days earlier. What they found there that day, only minutes after they entered, has proved to be crucial to the case.
The search team, one of two groups that went down that afternoon, was made up of the most senior investigators from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the New York City Police Department's bomb squad. Two were bomb squad detectives; the eight others were from the bureau, including two explosives technicians, each with a military explosives background, two forensic chemists and four crime scene investigators. 
 Their mission: to do swabbings and to find areas that would be good for locating evidence.
Armed with flashlights, a camera and evidence collecting kits, the group headed directly for level B-2, near the ramp to B-1 -- the area directly beneath the ballroom of the New York Vista Hotel, where the blast had left a huge hole. This, according to investigators who were at the site that day, was the most likely site to have been the bomb's origin.
 
Heaps of Debris
 Moving through piles of mangled vehicles, ducking pipes and beams that had fallen in the blast, they scanned the heaps of debris, looking for heavily damaged and blasted car parts -- the most obvious evidence of a vehicle that might have held a detonated explosive.
The investigators, who spoke only on condition that they not be identified, said that as the group of 10 broke apart to explore, four investigators, including the two bomb experts from the Federal bureau, Joseph Hanlin and Terry Byer; an A.T.F. agent, Kevin Washington, and a police bomb squad detective, Donald J. Sadowi, moved across the B-2 floor near the crater.
A large, grossly mangled piece of metal lying in pile of debris on the ramp caught the beam of one of their flashlights. Mr. Hanlin, the bomb expert, kneeled down, picked it up and turned it over. It was a piece of a heavy frame -- clearly, the investigators agreed, part of a truck or van. Inspection of the piece revealed a series of numbers stamped into the metal -- numbers that could be used to trace vehicle.
"This is something we need to take," Mr. Hanlin told the others, who quickly agreed.
 
Pieces of a Van
 The piece of frame, or chassis, was carted out on a gurney. It was one of less than a dozen pieces that came out that afternoon -- all of bits of what investigators later determined was a Ford Econoline van that had been rented from a Ryder rental company in Jersey City and later reported stolen.
During the two hours, other investigators, including John Goetz and David Sherman, found other pieces of shattered metal, each with partial identification numbers that were later traced back to the van. At about 5:30 P.M., the group emerged from the garage, having been warned that the chunks of concrete had not yet been stabilized, and they turned their evidence over to laboratory technicians.
The next day, almost certain that the mangled piece of frame would prove invaluable, one of the investigators went to the laboratory and extracted the number himself. He then turned it over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which tracked the part to a rental van, and finally to New Jersey and Mohammed A. Salameh , who was arrested last night and charged with participating in the bombing that left five dead and more than a thousand injured.
In the four days between that initial discovery, the 10 investigators were reassigned to other, smaller teams to continue examining the site. The principal evidence, however, had been found.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall on Signs of Weaker Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices retreated a bit yesterday despite another surge in bond prices as new reports of economic weakness put pressure on the market.
Health-care and technology issues were among the notable losers. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.13 points, to 3,398.91.
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.92 points, to 447.34, while the Nasdaq composite index lost 3.19 points, to 680.73.
 
Trading Volume Eases
 Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 234.2 million shares, down from 277.4 million on Wednesday. Advancing issues led decliners by 967 to 931 on the Big Board.
The stock and bond markets reacted differently yesterday to Government reports that factory orders were weaker than expected in January and that jobless claims increased in the latest period. Traders in both markets are also awaiting today's report on the nation's employment in February.
"The Dow and the Nasdaq were basically impacted by the weak economic data, which prompted the rally in the bond market, since those same numbers had just the opposite effect on stocks," said Robert C. Walberg, and equity analyst at MMS International, a Wall Street economic analysis and research firm.
Still, some traders said, further declines in stocks may be limited by falling interest rates. Yesterday, the rally in bond prices pushed the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds as low as 6.68 percent, before it edged back up to 6.73 percent. As yields in the bond market have been falling, some investors have turned to stocks in hopes of higher returns.
Mr. Walberg of MMS showed no concern about yesterday's market pullback. "We believe that low interest rates, low inflation and market sentiment are all still decidedly bullish," he said. "And we continue to expect new all time highs on the major market indexes by early spring."
 
Health-Care Weakness
 A factor weighing on the Nasdaq composite index yesterday was the downgrading of a couple of health- care stocks. U.S. Healthcare down 3 1/2, to 43, and Utah Medical down 2 1/4, to 16 1/2, suffered at the hands of analysts who revised their recommendations. U.S. Surgical, which was not downgraded, fell in sympathy as the stock dipped 2 1/2, to 58 1/2, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Other stocks weighing on the market included Intel, which fell 1 1/4, to 118 5/8, and Salomon Inc., which dropped 2, to 39 1/2. Salomon yesterday disclosed a pretax operating loss of $250 million in January and February that some analysts said might have been linked to bond trades that bet against a decline in interest rates.
Philip Morris fell 1 1/4, to 65 3/8, as Prudential Securities cut the rating on its stock amid talk of possible tax increases on cigarettes.
Nike, which began falling out of favor with investors about two weeks ago when it announced that earnings would be hurt by a slowdown in the European economy, dropped 3 1/4, to 71 5/8, yesterday.
Most retail stocks bounced back, posting only minimal declines. Wal-Mart and the Gap both fell 7/8, to 32 7/8 and 32 3/8, respectively.

HEADLINE: THE TWIN TOWERS: The Complaint;
Starting With Debris

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the complaint against Mohammed A. Salameh filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan.

 	 	 		. . .	 	On Feb. 26, 1993, an explosion occurred in the garage area beneath the Vista Hotel, located at the World Trade Center complex in New York, N.Y. (hereinafter "explosion site"), causing massive destruction and the death of at least five individuals.

 	 	 		. . .	 	 
 While collecting debris from the explosion site, the explosives expert has identified components of a vehicle which contained the explosive device. Among the components that the explosives expert has identified is a part of the vehicle displaying stamped numerical and alphabetical impressions from the manufacturer of the vehicle which he recognized as a portion of the manufacturer's vehicle identification number ("VIN").
Using the partial VIN as well as other information gathered during the crime scene investigation concerning characteristics of the vehicle which contained the explosive device, a fellow Special Agent of the FBI reconstructed the complete VIN of the vehicle which contained the explosive device.
A VIN history check revealed that the vehicle identified by that particular VIN was a Ford Econoline E-350 Van bearing Alabama license plate number XA 70668 (the "van"). A check with the Alabama authorities revealed that the van is registered to the Ryder Truck Rental Co. ("Ryder") in Alabama. Further investigation revealed that on or about Feb. 23, 1993, the van was rented for a one-week period from an office located in Jersey City, N.J., by an individual who identified himself as Mohammed Salameh.
On or about Feb. 26, 1993, approximately two to three hours after the bombing, Salameh returned to the Jersey City Ryder office. At the time, Salameh stated that the van had been stolen from a grocery store parking lot the night before (Feb. 25, 1993). Salameh requested a refund of a cash deposit he had left for the van but was told by a Ryder employee that he had to report the theft to the police and produce a copy of the police report in order to obtain a refund.
Later that evening, an individual identifying himself as Salameh entered a Jersey City police station and spoke with the desk officer. The individual told the desk officer, in substance, that the rental van he had been using had been stolen the previous evening. The individual further stated that he had attempted to report the theft the previous evening, but had been unable to because he did not have the license plate number of the van.
On March 4, 1993, Salameh returned to the Jersey City Ryder office. At the time, a Ryder employee identified Mohammed A. Salameh as the individual who had rented the van which was used in the World Trade Center bombing. Shortly thereafter, the defendant was arrested.
In connection with the rental agreement for the van, Salameh provided the telephone number (201) 435-7501 as a contact number, which further investigation revealed is subscribed to by Josie Hadas, 34 Kensington Ave., Apartment 4, Jersey City, N.J. A search warrant was executed this afternoon at this location, and special agents of the FBI recovered, among other things, a letter addressed to the defendant, tools and wiring, and manuals concerning antennae, circuitry and electromagnetic devices. A law enforcement officer trained as a bomb technician has examined these materials and has concluded that they constitute evidence of a "bomb maker" at the location. Lastly, a dog trained in the detection of explosives responded positively to a closet space within the apartment.

Mr. Lizzard, Following His Dream

BYLINE: By Charles Strum

DATELINE: ALPINE, N.J.

 BODY:
WHAT man has not wanted to live the imagined life? To fly like Chuck Yeager or Michael Jordan. To dance like Fred Astaire in a ballroom clinch with the girl of his dreams. To own a saloon and buy drinks for all his friends. To step off the treadmill, slip the bonds of 9-to-5 capitalism and give the soul some breathing room.
A show of hands, please? 
 Very good. Now, how many have actually dared to put the rose in their teeth and leap up on the table?
Only one? Way in the back? That clean-cut, slightly pear-shaped young man with the California king snake around his neck.
Naturally. It is Mr. Lizzard.
Once, Mr. Lizzard was merely Mark E. Wellington, a pleasant enough fellow with a contracting business and an acknowledged inability to spell simple words like lizard (one Z, according to the dictionary; two Z's, if you are Mr. Lizzard). Today he is a man living his compulsion: to share the joy of reptiles, which helps him get across the more urgent message that mankind is imperiling the environment.
This self-taught naturalist with the controlled but infectious enthusiasm of Indiana Jones has turned a lifelong hobby into a livelihood, which is not quite the same thing as a job.
"My main goal is to be independently wealthy and come and go as I please," Mr. Wellington said the other day, standing in the kitchen of his cozy Victorian cottage in this almost-rural reservation of large estates. "But if you have to work, this is a hell of a good choice."
It was not that Mr. Wellington disliked the contracting business all that much, although that was only the most recent of his mainstream vocations. Contracting required meeting someone else's expectations. Being Mr. Lizzard -- this is, admittedly, a fine point -- really requires meeting only one's own expectations. After all, people call on Mr. Lizzard because he is Mr. Lizzard, not because he is Mr. Mammal or Mr. Conifer, although he knows something about them, too.
His is the heart of the collector, the boy who raised mice, who built customized bookcases for his room with a glassed-in tarantula cage in the center. The teen-ager whose high school had to hire him part time to take care of the science lab he had stocked himself.
Skipping college, except for a brief stretch studying environmental science in Maine, Mr. Wellington went to work for his father, a millionaire industrialist. Later, he sold real estate. Finally, he joined his father and a brother restoring historic brownstones in Jersey City. Then the recession arrived, creating enforced leisure.
"That's when my daughter asked me to bring Petey the rat to school," he said.
Mr. Wellington did 10 minutes with Petey, a household pet. The rest is history. A day at school for Mr. Lizzard runs almost $500, plus expenses; a small birthday party goes for $145.
While his two daughters, ages 10 and 6, have accepted his menagerie, his marriage foundered on the rocks of the work ethic.
"My wife couldn't tolerate anything unsteady," he said, bringing out a favorite T-shirt. It depicts a snake coiled around a snake fancier, and it reads: "My wife says that if I buy one more snake she's going to leave me. Boy, am I going to miss her."
Don't be misled by Mr. Lizzard's disdain for the time clock or elbow grease. He has constructed a nifty climate-controlled herpetology den just off what was once the living room. He spends at least $100 a week for heat, light, frozen mice and rats (snake nourishment) and sundries for 30 reptiles, some tarantulas and a skunk. And schlepping reptiles all over New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania is no picnic.
"I'm searching for mellow, legal, nonpoisonous, well-traveling animals," he said. "That's why snakes are good." They are easily transported in a retrofitted beer chest with a hot water bottle in it.
His appearances are entry-level natural science workshops.
"It's hardly anything other than, 'We're having fun, and look at this, and we're part of the food chain.' Everybody pets and touches. No scientific names." He talks about the interrelatedness of air, water, food, animals. And he paints a grim picture.
"My basic thing to the kids is: 'If we continue what we do to the environment, we're all all going to be dead.' O.K., I'm not too harsh. We're not going to be dead next week or next year. But how would you like it if your grandchildren had to go out with a gas mask on?"
His dream is to have a big green Winnebago, with someone to drive him and someone to set up his shows.
"Then I would go out and talk to the kids," he said. "I would be dead if I had to get a desk job."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long Bond's Yield Down to 6.73%

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market rally that doesn't want to stop kept moving ahead yesterday, as the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 6.73 percent, from 6.78 percent on Wednesday.
And for a time yesterday, shorter-term interest rates also declined sharply, giving an indication that some investors and traders expect the economy to slow enough to force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again. 
 Early in the day, the price of the 30-year bond was up about 1 1/4 points, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 6.68 percent. This is the lowest interest rate since 30-year bonds began to be issued regularly 16 years ago and the lowest interest rate on any long-term bond since the Treasury issued a 20-year bond with a 6.75 percent coupon in January 1973.
 
 
Some Steam Is Lost
 But in the afternoon, the run-up lost a little steam, analysts said, because the rally had come so fast and because the February employment numbers, which will be released this morning, always give traders and investors a pause. In late trading, the price of the bond was up 22/32 , to 1052/32 .
There were also questions about how long the rally could continue. Peter Woll, an analyst at Municipal Market Data in Boston, expressed caution even as he acknowledged that the rally had already trampled those who were cautious.
"There is some concern this market is getting itself overblown," he said. "But we have been in and out of that camp for the last 100 basis points" of the decline in long-term yields.
 
 
Counting on Fed Easing
 In the morning rally, shorter-term yields on everything from three-month Treasury bills to two- , three- and five-year notes were swept lower. The discount rate on three-month bills fell to 2.88 percent (it ended the day at 2.91 percent) and the yields on two-year notes fell to 3.67 percent. Three-year notes fell to 4.07 percent, and five-year notes to 4.90 percent. (They ended the day at 3.72 percent, 4.16 percent and 5 percent, respectively.)
"At one point, it was beginning to price in a Fed ease," said Charles Lieberman, the director of financial market research at Chemical Securities, referring to how the market would respond to the expectation of a cut in interest rates by the Fed.
If today's employment report is weak, short rates could fall again. Mr. Lieberman is expecting a weak report, with an increase of only 50,000 in nonfarm payroll jobs. The consensus forecast is 126,000, according to Bloomberg Business News.
Two factors are accounting for the somewhat surprising drop in short-term yields. One is that economists and analysts do believe that President Clinton's deficit reduction will slow the growth of the economy, becuase he will be raising taxes and cutting government spending.
In addition, there has been a string of recent economic reports -- including a jump in initial jobless claims in late February, a January decline in factory orders and weak February retail sales -- that were weaker than expected.
"When I put that all together, I think that things might be slowing more than people think," said Stephen Slifer, the financial market economist at Lehman Brothers. And if you see a weak employment number tomorrow, the market will begin to expect it."
Mr. Slifer says he thinks the Federal Reserve will have to ease in the future as the economy continues to grow at a sluggish annual pace of around 2.5 percent. But Mr. Lieberman does not expect the Fed to ease, saying the economy is not heading back toward a recession.
 
 
Other Bonds
 The rush to refinance corporate and municipal debt at these unexpectedly low interest rates kept sales of new issues moving yesterday. There was about $2 billion of new corporate issues, including $200 million of 50-year bonds sold by Texaco Inc. This was the first 50-year bond ever sold by an industrial company, according to John Hewitt, the company's senior assistant treasurer.
The bonds, which are not callable for 20 years, were priced to yield 7.59 percent, which was 89 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the 6.70 percent yield on the 30-year Treasury bond at the time of the sale.
Mr. Hewitt said that the company got interested in the idea at the urging of Salomon Brothers, the lead underwriter, as the yield on the 30-year bond moved toward 6.80 percent. "We felt there was value in the bond for Texaco," he said, noting that the company could call the bonds in 20 years.
For investors who have been losing higher-interest-rate bonds as they have been called and refinanced, the 20-year protection against such a call was an attractive incentive. Robert Kleinert, the head of the fixed-income syndicate at Salomon, said the bonds were in such demand that the issue was increased to $200 million, from $150 million.
In the municipal market, prices were up about 3/8 point, according to Mr. Woll, after being up as much as 3/4 point. He said demand was strong enough for new issues that most were repriced yesterday to lower the yields. A sale of $579 million of revenue bonds for the New York Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority were repriced to yield from 2 percent in 1994 to 5.4 percent in 2015.

HEADLINE: Stocks Gain Allure as Bonds Lose Their Luster

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
A continued plunge in interest rates to the lowest level in decades is causing many money managers to make fundamental shifts in their investment strategies, flocking to stocks in search of the high returns that bonds had previously provided. Their enthusiasm has propelled some market averages to within inches of new highs this week, with stocks regaining all the ground they lost two weeks ago as President Clinton presented his proposed budget.
The consequences go far beyond the investment community. The stock market's vigor, if sustained, can help companies sell stock to pay down debt, expand and, often, add employees. 
 "All the things happening in the financial markets are extraordinarily constructive for corporate America," said Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch, referring both to lower interest rates and increased stock issuance. "The cost of capital has really come down dramatically in the last year. By many measures, it's lower for American companies than Japanese companies."
Although some money managers say stocks are already expensive, many consider the alternatives so unrewarding that they are willing to take some chances. Yesterday, the yield on the 30-year bond dropped to 6.73 percent, down from 6.78 percent the day before. [Page D13.]
"When bond yields are down in the 6 or 7 percent range," said Andrew R. Harmstone, who manages more than $2 billion for J. P. Morgan, "you get paid more to take on extra risk with stocks."
Although short-term thinking often rules the markets, the managers of pension funds and some other large investment pools move cautiously in changing their mix of stocks, bonds and cash -- the general term for risk-free but low-yielding investments.
The nation's 1,000 largest pension funds intend to put 55 percent of their assets into stocks, up from a goal of 52 percent a year ago, according to a survey conducted in January by Callan Associates, a financial consulting firm, as the plunge in bond yields was still gathering momentum.
With pension funds controlling more than $2.7 trillion in assets -- an amount nearly twice the national budget -- even a slight shift can make the markets jump.
For these money managers, the migration to stocks parallels the course already taken by individual investors. Individuals fled their low-yielding money market accounts and certificates of deposits to become net buyers of stocks in 1992 for the first time in 30 years.
 
An Uncertain Trend
 It remains uncertain how long the shift into stocks will continue. Some investors consider stock prices much higher than corporate earnings can support. Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.13 points, to 3,398.91, though bond prices rose.
President Clinton and his aides have claimed credit for the fall in interest rates, saying that investors are confident that their plans to cut the Government deficit will succeed. A lower deficit, with less Government borrowing, readily translates into lower interest rates.
The 6.7 percent interest now available on the Treasury's highest-yielding, 30-year bond falls far short of the returns many money managers have promised to deliver.
To meet a target of 8 3/4 percent, the $72 billion California Public Employees Retirement System appears likely to be among those switching money from bonds to stocks. "With yields well below 7 percent, it makes you look at other alternatives," said DeWitt Bowman, the fund's chief investment officer. The prospect for enhancing these yields with further gains in bond prices is limited, he added, explaining, "The bond market can't go to zero."
California's fund assesses its basic stance only once a year.
Stocks are more risky than bonds, with their returns varying more widely from year to year. But over the long term, stocks return about 10 percent annually, several percentage points more than bonds and much more than cash.
Changes by a few large money managers, sometimes taking place step-by-step over days or weeks, can sometimes result in jagged market reactions that have little apparent relation to the day's news.
Analysts saw major institutions shifting from bonds to stocks on Tuesday afternoon, when the Dow Jones industrial average jumped about 30 points, or almost 1 percent, to pass the 3,400 mark in the last hour.
The Dow now stands about 1 percent below the record of 3,442 set on Feb. 5, with such broader market indexes as the Standard & Poor's 500 even closer to their highs. Stocks have recovered since their mid-month fall despite a round of weak economic reports and Mr. Clinton's calls for larger tax increases on corporations and individuals than he had previously specified.
While such events might normally depress stock prices, the bond market shot high enough to more than compensate, analysts said. Besides believing that the deficit might shrink, many investors say that slower growth, with low inflation, will also keep bond prices high.
 
'A Pretty Narrow Tightrope'
 Some strategists, however, see rising risks in both stock and bond markets. A sharp reversal in bond prices, raising the available yields, would probably drag the stock market down, they say. Although low inflation and slow growth have given many bond investors confidence, a change in these conditions could cause interest rates to rise.
"All that's holding the market right now is interest rates," said David Borger, the research director at Wilshire Asset Management, which invests for many pension funds. "You're walking a pretty narrow tightrope if you're trying to make money in stocks and you're not a believer in bonds also."
Investors have recently bought record volumes of new shares, though the market's volatility has blocked a few issues. Companies that raise money by selling stock, instead of selling bonds or borrowing from banks, have greater flexibility.
For a company struck by recession or increased competition, cutting dividends conserves cash, even at the cost of angering shareholders. Missing a bank payment or defaulting on bonds can throw a company into bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Two European Giants Fail to Stop Their Slides

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, March 4

 BODY:
Two huge European companies Philips N.V. and Groupe Bull S.A. -- today announced substantial losses for 1992 as well as plans for new layoffs, underscoring the difficulties Europe has had pulling itself out of recession.
Philips, Europe's largest consumer electronics company, posted a $489 million loss. The company, based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, said it would lay off as many as 15,000 workers this year from a work force of 250,000. 
 Groupe Bull, a French computer maker, reported a $892 million loss and said it would lay off 3,000 people this year.
Together, the two dismal performances illustrate the deepening recession in Europe, where unemployment is rising and business confidence is slumping as industries including steel and autos grapple with a deepening economic crisis.
 
No Recovery in Sight
 Philips, which had reported a profit of $608.6 million in 1991, said its slump was chiefly the result of sharp price declines on products like color televisions, a stagnating market, excess capacity and currency instability in Europe. The company said also that it could not provide earnings predictions for 1993 because of the current uncertainties.
"The group management committee does not expect a recovery of the world economy during 1993," Philips said. "Prospects are relatively better in the United States, but Philips's main markets in Europe show no signs of improvement."
The company's 1992 loss came on sales of $31.8 billion, which were up 3 percent, compared with $30.9 billion for 1991. Europe accounted for 60 percent of Philips's sales last year, and the United States and Canada accounted for 21 percent.
 
Prices to Keep Falling
 "Philips is in trouble, and the outlook for their businesses, particularly in Europe, is poor," said Andrew Haskins, an electronics analyst at James Capel in London. "Falling volume and falling prices will continue to be the trend in consumer electronics in Europe in 1993."
Consumer electronics accounts for about 37 percent of Philips's total sales.
The company said it took a $652.2 million restructuring charge for 1992 mainly to cover the cost of planned layoffs in its consumer electronics and components sectors. It declined to say when the layoffs would be completed.
 
A Disappointment for Bull
 Bull's earnings report showed a decline from 1991, when the company posted a $585 million loss. While Bull's chief executive, Bernard Pache, and other top officials emphasized that the company had narrowed its operating loss in 1992 to $121 million, from $205 million for the previous year, the results were clearly a disappointment. Bull, which owns Zenith Data Systems in the United States, had planned to break even on its operations for 1992.
The $892 million loss for 1992 included a special provision of $462 million. More than half this sum will be spent to cover restructuring costs, including the probable layoffs this year of about 3,000 of the company's 35,000 employees. Bull has already cut 3,500 jobs in the last three years.
Sales fell 9.8 percent last year, to $5.7 billion. The company, which provided its own dollar conversions for its results at an average 1992 rate of 5.294 francs to the dollar, said one- third of the decline in sales was a result of currency fluctuations.
"Revenues were also affected by recessionary economic conditions worldwide, continued industry turmoil brought on by structural changes and pressures caused by aggressive price wars in personal computers," Bull said in a statement.
In a telephone interview, the company's chief financial officer, Jacques Lebhar, said prices for microcomputers had fallen by 50 percent last year in Europe.
 Bull's results were in line with the general slump in the European computer business. Manufacturers including Olivetti of Italy and Siemens Nixdorf of Germany have recently reported substantial losses in the face of stiff competition, plunging prices for personal computers and a European recession.
"Business is bad almost everywhere in the computer industry, and the Bull results are hardly surprising," Mary Tonnaire, an analyst at Dataquest in Paris, said. "The price war will continue into 1993 and the winners will be those, like Compaq, who can adjust most quickly."
Philips, under its president, Jan Timmer, who took over in mid-1990, has concentrated on its core consumer electronics business, divesting itself of its information systems division and some other interests. A question mark still hangs over this strategy.
New products such as the Compact Disk Interactive (CD-1) -- a compact disk player that combines sound, images and graphics -- and the digital compact cassette have yet to make an impact, and analysts predict that they will not contribute to profits before 1994 at the earliest.

HEADLINE: As Expected, Retailers Post Slow February Sales

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
The nation's retail chains reported yesterday that sales sagged in February compared with the same month last year. Analysts attributed the dip mostly to bad weather, which kept shoppers home, and to consumers' concerns over the economy.
Sales had been expected to drop after a very good Christmas season and a surprisingly strong January. Retailers usually spend February stocking spring merchandise and eliminating winter goods, so the month is often a lackluster one.
 
Suggests a Slowing Recovery
 Still, the latest figures disappointed some analysts and offered further evidence that the recovery has slowed since the start of the year. 
 The Salomon Brothers retail index, which follows monthly sales of 22 big retailers, showed that sales in stores open at least one year fell 1 percent in February. That compared with a 5.4 percent increase in January over January 1992. In December, retailers reported the strongest increase for a holiday season since 1988.
Other recent surveys have shown a drop in consumer confidence in the economy. Economists have noted that shoppers' pay increases have lagged behind their increased spending.
Jeffrey M. Feiner, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, attributed February's sales showing to bad weather as well as heavy promotions a year earlier that improved those sales figures. He also cited President Clinton's announcement last month of his economic plan, which includes tax increases to help cut the deficit.
 
Clinton's Effect Debated
 The plan "caused some uncertainty among consumers wondering whether it would have a really negative impact on the economy, on their own pocketbook, and so on," Mr. Feiner said.
But he sounded a note of optimism. "While this month was disappointing, that is due to what we believe to be nonrecurring or abnormal factors," Mr. Feiner said. "With more normal weather in March, we expect to see a pickup in sales. It is our opinion that underlying consumer demand still remains relatively favorable."
Edward Johnson, director of Johnson Redbook Service, a publication of the brokerage firm Lynch, Jones & Ryan that monitors retail performance, was less certain about the effects of the Clinton plan.
"The stores are saying that they think that the Clinton tax measures have hurt the consumer, but they can't be sure because of the weather," he said. "They don't know how much was the weather and how much was Clinton."
 
Leap Day's Impact
 Another factor in the disappointing numbers was the fact that the month this year lacked the extra selling day enjoyed last February in a leap year. The effect can be significant: for example, if results for Feb. 29, 1992, were excluded from last year's figure, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. would have shown a 6 percent increase in same-store sales for February this year instead of the flat sales it reported.
Mr. Barnard said the strongest sectors were furniture, home furnishings, appliances and electronics. He said chains with strong sales included Bed, Bath and Beyond, which was up 6 percent, and Heilig-Meyers, a Southern furnishings chain, which was up 8 percent.
Among the weakest sectors was apparel. Filene's Basement reported a 10 percent decline, and the Limited Inc. sales fell by 6 percent. Sears, Roebuck & Company, on the other hand, posted same-store sales gains of 2.2 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Mark Trading But Is Stronger Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against European currencies yesterday after Germany's central bank failed to make an expected cut in interest rates. But the dollar gained on the yen on hints of Japanese intervention to prop it up.
Gold prices were mostly lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $329.00, unchanged from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped 5 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $328.75 an ounce. 
 After advancing against the mark in European trading on expectations of a German rate cut, the dollar fell sharply when the Bundesbank left key rates unchanged.
Analysts said markets had been fairly active, with speculative dollar buying in anticipation of Bundesbank action that would have narrowed the gap between German and United States interest rates.
But "when it didn't happen, we saw the dollar trade down against the mark," said Kevin Lawrie, foreign exchange manager for the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
 
Japan Seen Intervening
 Overnight in Tokyo, traders said, the Bank of Japan called dealers to check currency rates. This was seen as a precursor to intervention to prevent a further slide of the dollar against the yen, which Japanese officials feel could wreak further havoc on the country's stagnating economy.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 116.98 yen, up 0.23 yen from Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 116.75 yen. In New York, the dollar ended at 116.75, up from 116.65 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.4540, from $1.4505 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.4560 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's $1.4510.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6380 German marks, down from 1.6460; 1.5195 Swiss francs, down from 1.5235; 5.5590 French francs, down from 5.5860; 1,563 Italian lire, down from 1,565, and 1.24365 Canadian dollars, up from 1.24225.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6340 German marks, down from 1.6459; 1.5165 Swiss francs, down from 1.5262; 5.5555 French francs, down from 5.5865; 1.8380 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8508; 1,563.00 Italian lire, down from 1,568.00, and 1.2424 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2472.

Boeing Sees Plane Orders Increasing

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
The Boeing Company said yesterday that it expected world air travel and demand for new airplanes to recover from the current slump, resulting in substantial growth by the end of the decade.
The Boeing 1993 Current Market Outlook, released yesterday, predicted that worldwide passenger travel would grow at an average annual rate of 5.4 percent from now through 2010. As a result, at least 12,000 commercial airliners, from all manufacturers, will be needed during those 18 years to accommodate growth and to replace older airplanes, according to the report.
 
$45 Billion in Annual Sales Seen
 Boeing estimated the value of the 12,000 aircraft at about $815 billion in 1993 dollars, averaging $45 billion a year in industrywide sales until 2010, compared with $21 billion annually for the last 20 years. The estimate did not represent a significant change from Boeing's projections of a year ago, and Boeing shares closed yesterday unchanged at $34.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Boeing's optimistic outlook comes after two months in which the Seattle company announced plans to scale back production of all of its commercial aircraft, and to eliminate 28,000 jobs within the next 18 months. Boeing had said the cuts were necessary because of canceled and delayed orders from carriers suffering from the global economic slump.
Speaking at a news conference in Washington yesterday, Richard R. Albrecht, executive vice president of the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, said that from an overall traffic decline in 1991, air travel improved during 1992.
"However, especially in the case of the domestic carriers," he said, "some of this growth came at the expense of yield," which is revenue per passenger-mile, because of the recession and the airlines' ruinous fare wars.
Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst with UBS Securities, said Boeing's "macro-forecast remains plausible." But he added that uncertainty remained as to whether "the global trade and investment framework remain as dependent on global transportation in the next 20 years as in the last 20 years."
Boeing said the Asia/Pacific region, especially China, would enjoy the highest future growth rates. Japan and China are the second- and third-largest aircraft markets, respectively, after the United States.

Antitrust Exemption Is Targeted In Senate

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
In a long anticipated move, Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum today introduced legislation that would eliminate major league baseball's 71-year-old exemption from Federal antitrust laws.
The Democrat from Ohio said the 1922 Supreme Court ruling, which exempted the major leagues from antitrust laws on the ground that the game could not be considered interstate commerce, no longer applies. 
 Repeal of the exemption would allow major league teams to move between cities without the permission of other major league clubs.
"Baseball is big business," said Metzenbaum, chairman of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Monopolies and Business Rights of the Senate Judiciary Committee. "It's a billion-and-a-half-dollar business, and it doesn't need nor does it deserve any special treatment under our antitrust laws."
Metzenbaum said that because baseball affects the public's taxes, the economies of local communities and the cost of cable television service, it should abide by the same rules that govern other industries. He said the 28 owners conduct themselves "like selfish barons lording over their personal billion-dollar domains," and should comply with federal monopoly laws as must professional basketball, football and hockey teams.
 
Tampa Bay 'Jilted'
 He and Senators Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, and Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, who co-sponsored the bill, pointed to the recent situation in which owners blocked Tampa Bay's $115 million offer to buy and move the San Francisco Giants. A San Francisco group allowed to bid on the team by the National League offered $100 million to Bob Lurie, and the league decreed that Lurie sell the Giants to the San Francisco group.
The Tampa Bay area, which also failed in its a bid for an expansion franchise when Miami and Denver were added to the National League, was "jilted" by the owners, Mack said.
Bud Selig of the Milwaukee Brewers, who leads the executive committee and in effect runs the major leagues, said the move was not unexpected. He defended baseball's use of the exemption.
"If you look at history," he said at a news conference after an owners' meeting today in Phoenix, "the antitrust exemption protects the public. If you asked Baltimore or Oakland football fans about having an exemption, that would give you the answer. What does it do for you if you take away the exemption. The fact of the matter is when all is said and done, the antitrust exemption has been a protection for the fans and baseball hasn't abused it."
Since Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the 1922 opinion granting the exemption, the high court has refused to overturn the decision. In 1971, however, the Court stated that Congress should reconsider it if there is "any inconsistency or illogic" to the exemption.

HEADLINE: The Art Market

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:

Who Sold What?
It looks as though it will take a trial to determine the power of a handshake between an artist and a gallery. 
 For those who are just tuning in, there's a new chapter in the continuing lawsuit against the artist Peter Halley, the dealer Larry Gagosian and the Gagosian Gallery, which has branches on Madison Avenue and in SoHo. The suit was filed eight months ago in State Supreme Court in Manhattan by the Sonnabend Gallery, which is in SoHo. Last week, the court released Justice Carol H. Arber's decision to deny a motion, filed by Mr. Gagosian and his gallery, to have the suit dismissed.
In February 1992, Mr. Halley left Sonnabend, where he had been represented for six years, and moved to Gagosian. He took with him 11 works, which Sonnabend says the artist made for a show scheduled to open last May. The exhibition at Sonnabend never took place; instead Mr. Halley's show opened at Gagosian's Wooster Street gallery in June. When the show was announced, Sonnabend filed the lawsuit, charging breach of contract and seeking damages. Sonnabend also sought, unsuccessfully, a temporary restraining order against Mr. Halley's show at Gagosian.
 
Buyers, but No Works
 According to court documents, Sonnabend is contending that although it had no written agreement with the artist, it had presold 11 of the works in the show. Sonnabend said that as of Feb. 27, 1992, the day Mr. Halley sent the gallery a letter to announce his departure, its director, Antonio Homem, had buyers for the 11 works and had paid Mr. Halley advances against the sales.
In June, Justice Arber ruled that Sonnabend had insufficient evidence that the 11 works had already been bought. Ten of the paintings were then sold by Gagosian for $75,000 each. According to court documents, a diptych priced at $150,000 was bought by the Whitney Museum of American Art. The Sonnabend Gallery contends that they had first showed the work to the Whitney; however, Mr. Gagosian got the commission. Sonnabend claims that the commissions belong to them. In her decision, Justice Arber said, "If plaintiff demonstrates at trial that the sale occurred prior to Halley's departure from Sonnabend, then plaintiff may be entitled to commissions resulting from these sales."
But in denying the motion to dismiss the suit, Justice Arber has decided that Sonnabend's complaint, despite the absence of a written contract, must go to trial. If Sonnabend can prove that Mr. Halley's oral agreement was as binding as a written contract, it could receive substantial punitive damages.
 
Incentive Is Denied
 If, as Sonnabend charges in court documents, the Gagosian Gallery gave Mr. Halley $2 million as an incentive to join it, the court could interpret that as economic duress. Both Mr. Halley and Mr. Gagosian deny it. "It's total fabrication," said Martin Wasser, Mr. Gagosian's lawyer and a partner at Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim & Ballon. "It will be impossible for them to prove."
Mr. Wasser added that he was pleased that the court had thrown out one of Sonnabend's claims, in which Ileanna Sonnabend, the gallery's owner, said she was promised a diptych for her own personal art collection for half the $150,000 retail price. As for the rest of the decision, Mr. Wasser said he doesn't think "Sonnabend will be able to substantiate its claims or that they will be successful in proving any of the allegations."
In a broader context, the case is yet another illustration of the big money that's now involved in handling a successful artist. Sonnabend Gallery charges that Mr. Halley left Sonnabend because he was able to get a written contract from Gagosian that promised him a stipend larger than the $40,000 he had received from Sonnabend.
"The judge is letting the court decide the practices of the art market," said Daniel Shapiro, Sonnabend's lawyer.
Whether the case goes as far as a trial remains to be seen. Stay tuned.
 
A Successful Art Show
 Everyone was surprised by the brisk business at the fifth annual Art Show, which ended Monday after a five-day run at the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue. The press office for the show, which is organized by the Art Dealers Association of America, reported 13,500 visitors, the largest crowd in three years. "Not only was attendance up, but about 80 percent of the exhibitors made sales," said O. Kelly Anderson, director of the Art Dealers Association.
Art experts suggested that the dealers this year had been careful to price works conservatively. And that being realistic had paid off.
Noting that he had come to the show "prepared for a disappointment," Richard Gray, a Chicago dealer, said, "Although business in the gallery has been better recently, I thought the news from Washington about Clinton's proposed economic plan would have taken the wind out of our sails, since the rise in taxes will affect my customers." But much to Mr. Gray's surprise, he sold more than $5 million worth of art, including works by Picasso, Paul Klee, Alberto Giacometti, Henry Moore and Anselm Kiefer.
William Beadleston, a New York dealer, also reported some important sales, including a painting by Jean Dubuffet. "People seemed more optimistic," he said. "There were lots of new buyers. It seemed the art world had gone back to the way it was years ago, when collectors buy for their pleasure, not for their purses."
 
Non-Traveling Shoes
 Since 1958, van Gogh's "Shoes" has been on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art from an unidentified private collector. Happily for the Metropolitan, "Shoes" isn't going anywhere. Walter H. Annenberg, the publisher, philanthropist and former United States Ambassador to Britain, who two years ago promised to bequeath roughly $1 billion worth of paintings to the Metropolitan, bought the painting from the collector and has added the 1888 van Gogh to his list of gifts.
Philippe de Montebello, the museum's director, confirmed Mr. Annenberg's most recent donation but declined to disclose what Mr. Annenberg had paid for the painting.
" 'Shoes' will be one more van Gogh in the Annenberg collection," Mr. de Montebello said. It brings the total to six. At the moment, "Shoes" is on view in the temporary exhibition space in the European Paintings Galleries, which are under renovation. It will eventually join the other 53 paintings from the Annenberg collection that are scheduled to go on view beginning Sept. 21 when the 19th-century European Painting and Sculpture galleries reopen.
 
Higher Commissions
 Phillips, the world's third largest auction house, based in London, has caved in, too. Last week it announced that it would follow Sotheby's and Christie's and increase its buyer's premium to 15 percent on lots sold for 30,000 (about $42,000) or less. The buyer's premium, a fee the purchaser pays to the auction house in addition to the final bid, will remain at 10 percent on any portion of the price above 30,000.
Phillips will also keep the old premium of 10 percent for specialized sales of stamps, coins, metals and wine in London.
In addition to the buyer's commission, auction houses also charge a seller's commission, a negotiable fee paid by the seller that can range from nothing to 15 percent of the final price. A higher buyer's premium means that an auction house can shave more off the seller's premium, and thereby attract more consignments.
"We were strongly opposed to raising the premium," said Christopher Weston, the chairman of Phillips. "In 1975, when our competitors first introduced the buyer's premium, we held out for three years and eight months. It ended up helping everyone except Phillips." Now, Mr. Weston said, he feels that Phillips has been "backed into a corner."
The last straw he said, was an attempt last year by Sotheby's to snatch away a Phillips client by offering to sell a painting without charging her a seller's commission. At stake was "The Promised Land" by the English painter Charles Spencelaugh; it eventually sold at Phillips for 91,000 (or about $127,400).
Diana Phillips, who heads Sotheby's press offices in New York and London, conceded that Sotheby's had made such an offer. "While the auction business is a competitive business, we do respect the consignments from other firms," she said. "This is not our normal practice."
Mr. Weston, who said Phillips's market share in London was in excess of 10 percent, added: "Sotheby's has really given us no choice. We have to maintain a competitive stance or we'll lose the opportunity to sell top-flight items, as well as market share."

HEADLINE: Where Stardust Dreams Are, Always

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
THE image of a Manhattan nightclub for many people will always be synonymous with the impossibly glamorous fantasies of New York nightlife imagined by Hollywood movies of the 1930's and 40's. And when Mary Cleere Haran, a singer who cultivates a sophisticated but wholesome 1940's look, performed for the first time at Rainbow and Stars recently, she evoked that mythical ambiance with a wistful good humor.
"It's not exactly what I had envisioned it would be like when I saw those movies with nightclubs," she observed of Rainbow and Stars, which represents the top of the line in New York City cabarets. 
 "As beautiful and romantic as this room is, it's so small compared to those vast Hollywood soundstages where they used to build those gorgeous white Art Deco nightclub sets. And for another thing, I have to sing more than one song per show.
"If you've seen any of those movies, the lights would dim, there would be a drum roll or a fanfare, a spotlight would hit the bandstand, and out would come Rita Hayworth or Veronica Lake or Lizbeth Scott, who would proceed to sing one song. Then she'd get to sit down at a ringside table with the likes of Alan Ladd or Glenn Ford, engage in some light flirtatious banter laced with double-entendres. And then our male protagonist would say something that hit a little too close to home, she'd get insulted, bolt up, and run out of the room in tears."
If the nightclub dream world that Ms. Haran conjures so wittily never existed in real life, what is surprising is how many New York clubs offer small but delicious pieces of that world, each one with its own special flavor.
New York, moreover, is the only city left in the country that offers anything resembling the old-time nightclub entertainment where the songs of Cole Porter or Richard Rodgers or George Gershwin live on. Cabaret's continued existence, despite perilous economics, owes much to the proximity of Broadway, which, while having its own problems, still draws a pool of performers to New York. Failing a show, these singers and musicians have to find some place to develop their skills and be seen by one another. What better forum than a cabaret, a crowded field in which all but a dozen performers do it more for love than money.
This March has been designated Cabaret Month by the Manhattan Association of Cabarets, an organization of performers, club owners, bookers, managers and press agents founded 10 years ago to stir up business. On March 22 at Symphony Space on Broadway, the group will distribute awards for excellence in the field. The continuance of the MAC Awards, as they are known, testifies to the spiritual hardiness of an entertainment genre that despite economic hardship and devastation from AIDS is holding its own.
During Cabaret Month, two Manhattan cabarets that had been dark have ambitious plans to reopen. The 80-seat Blue Room at the Supper Club, at 240 West 47th Street, will begin its cabaret season on March 18. Its roster of forthcoming talent includes Morgana King, Little Jimmy Scott, Rosalind Kind and Chip Zien. Club 53 at the New York Hilton Hotel in midtown will also reopen, on Thursday, with previews of "Back to Bachrach and David," a revue of songs by the famous 60's songwriting team that had a brief but successful run last year at Steve McGraw's in Manhattan.
And this October, the fourth Cabaret Convention, sponsored by the Mabel Mercer Foundation, will increase its number of gala concerts in the Town Hall series in Manhattan to a full week of events.
Here is a selective guide to Manhattan cabarets. The list omits comedy clubs and piano bars. And clubs like the Blue Note, Fat Tuesday's, J's and the newly opened Five Spot that cultivate a jazz audience but sometimes feature pop talent are also not included. A significant difference between Manhattan's jazz clubs and its cabarets is the quality of the sound. The jazz clubs, most notably the Blue Note, have much more sophisticated sound systems. While none of the city's cabarets has inadequate sound, the audio systems tend to be designed to suit a more modest, non-rock technology.
 
Rainbow and Stars
 With its spectacular view looking north over Central Park, its superb food and its comfortably lush accommodations, Rainbow and Stars, on the 65th floor of the G.E. Building, probably comes the closest of any New York club to resembling the old-time Hollywood ideal of Manhattan nightclub glamour. The club, which opened in January 1989, is one of the jewels of Rockefeller Center's handsomely refurbished Rainbow complex, which is a major New York tourist attraction.
Seating is spacious with most of the tables situated on either side of a small platform stage that silhouettes the performers in front of windows overlooking Central Park. The most dramatic views are to be had from a row of tables nestled along the curved walls directly facing the stage. A flashing fiber-optic rainbow designed by Milton Glaser blinks its reflections on the windows behind the performer. Sight lines are good, and the sound is clear and well directed. But it is a little spread out: in this case closer to the stage is better.
In its programming, the club has tried quite successfully to appeal both to tourists and to the discriminating cabaret audience. Rosemary Clooney, who appeals to both, recently sold out the club for a month. A series of revues celebrating great American songwriters has had its artistic ups and downs. But the latest edition, a salute to Rodgers and Hammerstein, featuring talented younger theater singers, is one of the ups.
Rainbow and Stars is expensive; dinner for two will cost over $100. And for its most popular attractions, dinner is often required for the early show.
 
Cafe Carlyle
 The Cafe Carlyle, in the Hotel Carlyle on East 76th Street, is the only New York cabaret to exude a distinct aura of East Side chic, and performances can have the hushed, formal atmosphere of a drawing-room concert. The recently expanded menu features pricey elegant cuisine; entrees run in the $20 to $30 range. The club's ambiance is enhanced by the sumptuous Vertes wall murals and upholstered love seats interspersed among the tables.
For more than two decades, the Cafe Carlyle has been almost synonymous with Bobby Short, who now performs there four months of the year and whose attitude of high-toned playfulness perfectly matches the decor. Mr. Short is not the cafe's only regular inhabitant. Eartha Kitt, who is playing there now, has become a regular, as has Barbara Cook. The magnificently raucous Dixie Carter, another regular, opens there later this month.
 
Bemelmans Bar
 Also in the Hotel Carlyle is Bemelmans Bar, a piano bar. Across the hall from the Cafe Carlyle, Bemelmans has a more informal, post-collegiate atmosphere. Its most frequent denizens are Barbara Carroll and Ronny Whyte (its current occupant), both staid pop-jazz singers and pianists whose performances frequently have to compete with conversation.
 
The Ballroom
 If the Ballroom weren't in one of the seedier areas of Chelsea, it would probably be a roaring success, for it is one of the best-run cabarets in New York. As it is, the club has had to struggle to survive. The Ballroom, which was in SoHo in 1973 and moved uptown in 1981, is a small theater with table seating. It charges extra for ringside seating, which is usually well worth the money. Its front room is one of New York's more acclaimed Spanish restaurants, renowned for its tapas.
Three years ago, with the introduction of a winter series of Brazilian concerts, the club underwent a dramatic change in programming philosophy. The series, now in its third year, has been quite successful and has prompted a more international approach to booking talent. A high point last year was the appearance of the Fassbinder film star and chanteuse Ingrid Caven, who is scheduled to return later this year. The club has the best sound and lighting system and engineer (Steve Visscher) of any New York cabaret.
 
The Oak Room
 The Oak Room in the Algonquin Hotel in midtown, which was recently refurbished so as not to tarnish its traditional image, is a comfortably moody landmark of an earlier era. With its orange lanterns on wood-paneled walls, the club has a quietly romantic ambiance that is perfectly suited to Andrea Marcovicci, who has become to the Oak Room what Bobby Short is to the Cafe Carlyle. Last fall, she sold out her entire four-month engagement there.
A popular nightclub before World War II, the Oak Room was used only for dining in more recent times. Then in 1981, the singer and pianist Steve Ross reintroduced live entertainment, and it has since become a full-time cabaret. Its sight lines are good, but the food is quite expensive and stodgy. Daugherty and Field, the room's current inhabitants, bring a vaudevillian sense of fun to a program of songs by Harold Arlen.
 
Russian Tea Room
 One of New York's successful recent nightclub ventures has been the transformation of an upstairs back room of the Russian Tea Room into an elegant part-time cabaret that has attracted a loyal and growing audience to its weekend and Monday evening performances. It has a smaller, separate menu from the main restaurant; the well-prepared, Russian-accented entrees run in the $22 to $34 range. And the intimate 80-to-100 seat room, which suggests a warmer version of the Cafe Carlyle, inspires an atmosphere of camaraderie. The club has slowly been expanding its schedule. Last year, Julie Wilson became the first performer to be booked for an extended run, and did well. And Amanda McBroom, the composer of "The Rose," has been booked into the club in May for a three-week engagement.
Winter events include a Sunday night series that features two shows this weekend by Ann Hampton Callaway. On Monday evenings, Ascap, the song-licensing agency, is presenting a showcase for singers and songwriters.
 
Michael's Pub
 One of the city's longest-running clubs, Michael's Pub has been in existence since 1954 and moved to its present home in midtown in 1971. For the last two decades, it has been the site of Woody Allen's Monday evening performances with the New Orleans Funeral and Ragtime Orchestra. Mel Torme is an annual fall attraction. One of its most successful shows ever, Vernel Bagneris's tribute to Jelly Roll Morton, is about to end a run that has lasted 22 weeks. On March 16, Mickey Rooney will make his cabaret debut there in a show of songs and stories.
The club has very good sight lines, but the food is basic pub fare. And when the most popular acts appear, it can be too tightly packed.
 
The Chestnut Room
 The Chestnut Room, one of the New York's newest clubs, is still getting its footing, but its future looks promising. Situated in the heart of the Tavern on the Green complex in Central Park, it has the feel of being in a spacious, elegantly appointed greenhouse. With seating for 160, it has the same expensive dinner menu as the main restaurant: entrees range from $11 to $32. Its programming mixes traditional jazz groups with pop-jazz singers. On Tuesday, Chris Connor begins a two-week engagement.
One of the club's musical features is its $80,000 Hamburg Steinway Model D concert grand piano. The atmosphere is comfortable and friendly, and although the food is expensive, the entertainment fees are very reasonable: cover charges are $10 to $15 a person.
 
Eighty Eight's
 Eighty Eight's, a two-tiered Greenwich Village club operated by Erv Raible (the president of the Manhattan Association of Cabarets), has been an important launching pad for talent that has included Jeff Harnar, the Wise Guys and Daugherty and Field. The Richard Maltby-David Shire revue "Closer Than Ever" also originated here. And a show of songs by Mary Rodgers, conceived by Mr. Maltby, will have its first performance there on March 17.
The showcase club, which seats 65, is upstairs. The downstairs room is a clubby piano bar frequented by Broadway choristers and musical comedy aficionados.
Acts are booked (two a night, except for four on Sunday beginning with a 3 P.M. brunch show), for one night on consecutive weeks, down the calendar. Two of the more popular singers to appear there this weekend are Sara Zahn and Baby Jane Dexter. The only food served is brunch on Sunday. Cover charges are very reasonable: $10 to $12 a person.
 
Steve McGraw's
 This 135-seat, second-floor cabaret theater on the Upper West Side was opened four years ago on the site of what used to be Palsson's Supper Club. It is the present home of the long-running revue "Forever Plaid." Late last year, the same stage saw a limited run of an early version of a revue of the songs of Burt Bacharach that is soon to have another life at Club 53.
In and around the schedule of "Forever Plaid" this month will be woven a number of benefit concerts featuring Broadway names. The room has the atmosphere of a post-college hangout for Broadway babies. The club has just inaugurated a downstairs piano room that is open seven nights a week.
 
Danny's Skylight Room
 The cabaret in this very small, intimate, reasonably priced club in the back room of Danny's Grand Sea Palace Restaurant in the theater district was inaugurated in 1987, and is singer-oriented. Jill O'Hara, Jill Corey and Monica Lewis made their returns to nightclub performance at the club, which is known for its discriminating taste in talent that is little known but worthy. The room, with its distinguishing skylight, is comfortable but spare.
 
Judys'
 This cozy little club with mirrored walls and a tiny stage almost has the feel of a boutique. Established by the semi-legendary cabaret proprietor Jan Wallman in the mid-1980's, it was taken over two years ago by Richard Hendrickson and re-named Judys' -- after famous Judys, from Garland to Holliday. Under its new owner, it introduced a piano bar in the front room. There is entertainment sevennights a week. The place remains a hub for a circle of veteran performers, including Arthur Siegel and the team of Judy Kreston and David Lahm, who are appearing on Saturdays through March. The menu is Italian and reasonably priced, with entrees in the $8.95 to $15.95 range.
 
Don't Tell Mama
 This midtown cousin of Eighty Eights, with a clientele that is heavily show-business oriented, recently subdivided into two small functional showcases with little elbow room. The quality of talent is generally a notch below that of Eighty Eight's. Two of the more popular long-running shows are a revue about voyeurism, "Beyond the Window," which plays Thursday evenings, and "The Heat Is On," a salute to Rita Hayworth featuring Quinn Lemley, which plays on Saturdays.
 
Tatou
 Tatou, a glitzy restaurant, dance club and cabaret, has had several notable earlier incarnations. At one time the midtown spot was the Versailles, a ballroom and supper club where Desi Arnaz led an orchestra and Edith Piaf would appear. More recently, it was the Club Ibis, which featured bellydancing. After several years of inactivity, it reopened in 1990 as Tatou. Its main event these days is the "The Tatou Follies," a Tuesday evening revue presented by R. Couri Hay and Robert Frye that features guest celebrity impersonators. With a noise level comparable to a disco, it is anything but intimate.
 
The Duplex
 A small, often crowded upstairs club, the Duplex, on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village, has a high turnover of acts of varying quality. The entertainment runs from comedy to drag acts to a continuing talent show, "Stars of Tomorrow," which has its final round on March 26. The Gotham City Improv performsits show "Politically Erect" on Saturday nights at 8.
The club, which used to be on Grove Street, is a strictly functional showcase that offers minimal comfort. During crowded performances, it can feel like a school cafeteria.

A Series That Just Might Be for Real

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
Tonight at 9:30, network television comes up with still another comedy series featuring still another group of very talented black American performers. Apparently, the black experience in America is fine for prime time if it can be milked for a few laughs. Occasionally, though, there is substance lurking in the comedy. That was true of NBC's "Cosby Show." And it just might turn out to be true of ABC's new "Where I Live."
A couple of years ago, the producer Michael Jacobs ("Dinosaurs") was devising a version of Thornton Wilder's "Our Town" that would be set in a black community. Meanwhile, Ehrich Van Lowe (a producer of "The Cosby Show") was developing a series based on his experiences growing up in the Bronx. The two eventually got together with Disney's Touchstone Television to develop "Where I Live." It is set in Harlem, though it is filmed on an elaborate street set in Burbank, Calif. 
 At first glance, the show looks unpromisingly like too many current sitcoms about blacks, with monotonously suggestive humor laid on with the broadest of brush strokes. Doug E. Doug ("Hangin' With the Homeboys"), the star, plays Doug St. Martin, a dreadlocks-topped 17-year-old with a platinum attitude and a habit of talking directly to the camera. His two best friends are Reggie (Flex) and Malcolm (Shaun Baker). This trio is sometimes joined by 10-year-old Kwanzie (Jason Bose Smith), who, as the standard cute sitcom kid, is ardently wooing Doug's 14-year-old sister (Yunoka Doyle). "I loves you," he shouts up to her window, "and I will have you, baby".
But the street goofing does give way to real issues, usually set off by Doug's Caribbean-born parents, James, a cab driver (Sullivan Walker), and Marie (Lorraine Toussaint). In tonight's premiere, Doug learns from his father that Reggie has won a basketball scholarship to St. John's University. But Reggie himself hasn't even told Doug. Worse, Doug is now hassled by his father for spending too much time on the street at the "University of the Stoop." Doug's proposed solution: drop out of school altogether and, getting a jump on Reggie, find a job. No way: not with these parents.
The producers say they want to "take a look at the people, community and culture of Harlem." These are working people, economically several rungs below the upper-middle-class "Cosby Show" denizens, but safely above those whom sociologists call the despairing underclass. And obviously, these are people with compelling stories to be told. A comedy series, especially one as carefully thought out and appealingly acted as "Where I Live," is one quite promising way of doing it. Next week, the St. Martin family tackles the thorny issue of incendiary rap lyrics.
 
'The Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Celebration' 'Part 1'
PBS
 (In New York, Channel 13, tomorrow at 8 P.M.)
This concert was recorded at Madison Square Garden in October, and was offered live at the time on pay-per-view television. Now it kicks off "In the Spotlight," a new series aimed at baby boomers (read: aging baby boomers). The premiere is crammed with stars paying homage to Mr. Dylan and his music. Among the numerous highlights: John Mellencamp's version of "Like a Rolling Stone," Tracy Chapman's "Times They Are a-Changin'," Eric Clapton's "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right," Willie Nelson's "What Was It You Wanted" and Sophie B. Hawkins's "I Want You."
On the down side, there's the audience, lustily cheering the songs and their own early years of anti-establishment protest, and then briefly turning into a mob to boo Sinead O'Connor off the stage; apparently, her anti-Pope rebelliousness on "Saturday Night Live" went too far for many at this middle-age hootenanny. A festive and even historic occasion ends up with an unsightly smudge. Part 2 of the celebration will be broadcast on Channel 13 next Saturday.

HEADLINE: Overhaul Set for Domestic-Help Rules

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
Shaken by the trouble over Zoe Baird, Congress began steps today to make it easier for well-off people to pay Social Security and unemployment insurance taxes for their domestic help.
Two subcommittees of the House Ways and Means Committee held a joint hearing on legislation that would raise the amount of wages that must be paid before taxes are due and permit employers of household help to file the required forms just once a year. 
 The current law, unchanged since 1950, has been mostly honored in the breach and disregarded by lawmakers. But it came into public attention this year when Ms. Baird, President Clinton's first nominee to be Attorney General, was forced to withdraw, in part because she had not paid the required taxes for her nanny and chauffeur, who were illegal immigrants.
"Single-handedly, Ms. Baird has done more to publicize the law which provides Social Security coverage for domestic employees than the I.R.S. or the Social Security Administration has ever managed to do," said Representative Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky.
 
Easing Burden on Employers
 Most of the testimony today dealt with the need to lessen the burden employers face to comply with the law, but a first-term lawmaker from Florida offered a different perspective.
"I was once a domestic worker," said Representative Carrie Meek, a Democrat from Miami. "My mother was a domestic worker. All my sisters were domestic workers."
Household workers, she said, should not be denied the retirement benefits and protection against disability and unemployment that all other employees have. She said it was important to keep the wage threshold low enough so maids who work one day a week for several different families would be covered.
Under the 1950 law, employers must pay Social Security and Medicare taxes for every household worker who is paid more than $50 in a calendar quarter, even the teen-ager who occasionally baby-sits or mows the lawn. If the worker is paid more than $1,000 in a quarter, the unemployment insurance tax is due.
The Social Security and Medicare tax is 15.3 percent of wages, of which half is supposed to be paid by the employer and half withheld from the employees' pay, but many employers of household help pay both halves themselves. The unemployment tax varies but is generally about 2 percent of the first $7,000 of wages in a year, all paid by the employer.
Marshall V. Washburn, an official at the Internal Revenue Service, told the lawmakers that only about 500,000 taxpayers paid taxes for their household help, while "more than several million households should be reporting."
When the Social Security law was expanded in 1950 to include domestic workers, he said, the $50 threshold was set to exempt "casual labor," but inflation has made that meaningless.
Employers must file five to eight separate Federal forms each year to comply with the law, and often state forms must also be filed. One reason so few taxpayers comply, Mr. Washburn said, is the amount of record-keeping and paperwork.
Lawmakers who want to change the law believe that if the wage threshold is raised to a more realistic level that exempts the casual baby sitter and if the paperwork is made minimal, more employers will comply with the law and more household workers will eventually become eligible for Social Security benefits.
The proposed legislation was introduced this year by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Committee, and it is almost certain to become law in one form or another.

HEADLINE: Clinton Signs Measure Extending Jobless Pay

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
The House gave final Congressional approval today to emergency unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless, and this evening President Clinton signed the bill, the first piece of his economic revival program to become law.
The measure, which will cost $5.7 billion, extends through Oct. 2 a Federal program that gives unemployed Americans who have already exhausted the standard 26 weeks of benefits as much as six months in additional aid. Without the extension, the program would have expired at midnight Saturday. 
 In a signing ceremony at the White House, Mr. Clinton said, "With this bill becoming law, 1.5 million unemployed Americans who need help making the rent and buying groceries and paying for school clothes will receive it."
Under the new law, unemployed workers who have exhausted their standard benefits will receive additional benefits for either 20 or 26 weeks, depending on the unemployment level in their state. At present, only Alaska, California, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington State, West Virginia and Puerto Rico have unemployment rates high enough for their residents to qualify for the 26 weeks. Unemployed workers elsewhere qualify for only 20 weeks.
 
Freezing Congressional Pay
 The law also imposes a pay freeze on members of Congress, a provision stemming from Mr. Clinton's call for a freeze on the salaries of all Federal workers as a gesture of sacrifice.
As a result, the lawmakers' annual salaries will remain at $133,600 next year instead of rising to the $136,405 that would have taken effect through an automatic 2.1 percent cost-of-living increase.
The House had earlier passed the unemployment benefits bill without the salary-freeze provision. The freeze was adopted by the Senate when it passed the bill on Wednesday, and the House quickly added the Senate language today.
The House vote to extend the unemployment benefits was 247 to 156. A separate vote of 403 to 0 added the pay freeze.
In both chambers, Republicans complained that the unemployment bill would mean a $5.7 billion addition to the Federal budget deficit. They said that the bill was an omen of things to come and that Mr. Clinton and his Democratic allies in Congress were not really serious about reining in the deficit.
"Where's the beef?" said Representative Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania. "Where's the funding so we don't continue to put burdens on our children?"
But Democrats argued that the extended benefits would be paid for by the economic revival promised by Mr. Clinton's larger economic plan. They held ranks and defeated Republican efforts to start enacting Mr. Clinton's plan piecemeal and to finance the $5.7 billion now with spending cuts.

HEADLINE: Trade's New Sheriff

 BODY:
Both Clintons were on view last week. In full campaign mode, he bustled out to a Boeing plant to berate European governments for unfairly subsidizing Airbus, Boeing's main rival. On Friday he sounded more conciliatory. "We must compete, not retreat," he told a university audience. "The truth of our age is this: Open and competitive commerce will enrich us as a nation."
Mr. Clinton is hardly the first President to sing the good-cop, bad-cop tune: Free trade is fine as long as it's fair. What's interesting about his rendition is its timing. Only six weeks on the job and he's already announced that there's a new sheriff in town, one who's not afraid to swagger a bit on the international stage. 
 That's probably not a bad strategy for a man who, for all his domestic expertise, is probably viewed as a novice by the trade mandarins in foreign capitals. And some threats against unfair practices could well be useful should Mr. Clinton seek further concessions in the forthcoming resumption of the Uruguay Round trade negotiations.
Fearful of losing access to the rich U.S. market, trading partners might agree to knock down more barriers to American exports like food, movies and services. The Bush Administration played that card well, mixing retaliation and negotiation to begin prying open the Japanese market to American semiconductors and the European market to soybeans.
But history also suggests that retaliation misapplied can start a commercial war. If Mr. Clinton backs up his threatening rhetoric at the Boeing plant by imposing tariffs or quotas, Europe is quite likely to respond in kind. And the United States could come out on the short end. Boeing has sold more aircraft to Europe than Airbus has sold to America.
Mr. Clinton breaks no new ground when he threatens reprisals against countries that trade unfairly. That's existing U.S. policy, condoned by international rules. Under normal procedures, trade violations are submitted to international panels as a prelude to retaliation. But when those mechanisms fall short, or don't apply, some in Congress urge unilateral retaliation: The U.S. decides on its own what foreign practices are unfair and what sanctions are in order -- even if the sanctions violate U.S. trade commitments.
Because the U.S. is the 800-pound gorilla of international trade, it can get away with a lot of bullying. But if the process gets out of hand, reciprocal warfare can result. Furthermore, the U.S. does not come to the debate with entirely clean hands. It imposes tariffs or quotas on dairy products, textiles, apparel, sugar, peanuts and scores of other products.
Nevertheless, many Americans feel that their country has been a trade wimp. Mr. Clinton's tough talk can help ventilate voters' demands for protectionist measures and also help educate trade partners about the political necessities faced by an American President.
The key question involves Mr. Clinton's larger objective. Is it to expand trade by opening markets abroad? Or is it to protect American industry by closing markets at home? The President knows that open markets have enriched America in the past. He also knows that his plans for economic growth depend heavily on widening those markets while restoring American competitiveness.
He is within his rights, and on solid philosophical ground, to challenge discrimination wherever he finds it -- to make the playing field as level as he can. The trick is to do so by bargaining patiently, even relentlessly, and by staying within the rules unless other nations make it impossible. There's a big difference between a tough sheriff and a rogue cop.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Greatest Challenge

BYLINE: By Richard Nixon; Richard Nixon, the former President, recently returned from his third trip to Russia in three years.

 BODY:
Those who would disagree, as I do, with some of the specific proposals in President Clinton's economic program must give him credit for his boldness and political courage in advocating them and for his indefatigable efforts to sell them to the American people.
If he demonstrates the same leadership qualities in addressing the major foreign policy issue of our time, he can secure his place in history as a great President. That issue is the survival and success of political and economic freedom in Russia. 
 That is not to say that the Mideast, Iraq and Bosnia are not also important, or that the nations of Eastern Europe and the other former Soviet states do not also deserve priority attention where they have democratically elected governments and have initiated serious free-market economic reform. But what happens in Russia will have an enormous effect on those nations, on our allies and on the United States.
Without a substantial increase in aid from the West, the Yeltsin Government will not survive. The U.S. must lead in providing it. It is a very tough sell for the President. The last Gallup poll showed that only 4 percent of voters considered foreign policy to be an important issue. In Mr. Clinton's nationally televised town meeting, there was only one question concerning foreign policy. It was about Bosnia. His political advisers understandably will tell him, as they did in the campaign, "It's the economy, stupid!"
But foreign and domestic policy are like Siamese twins -- one cannot survive without the other. If Boris Yeltsin's democratic Government collapses and is replaced by an aggressive, hard-line nationalist government, this will have a far greater impact on the American economy than all the Clinton domestic programs combined. The peace dividend will be down the tubes. The defense budget will have to be increased by billions of dollars rather than cut. This would mean that the President's plan to cut the deficit would have to be taken off the table.
The Russian democracy is going through a deadly crisis. The negative factors are frightening. Russia has 31 republics and provinces that have declared their sovereignty and 132 nationalities. Before the peaceful revolution of December 1991, the Russian people had never known either political or economic freedom. What works in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary will not work in Russia.
Russia is going through an economic downturn worse than the Great Depression of the 1930's in the United States. In 1992 inflation was 25 percent a month, the gross national product was down 20 percent, and living standards were down 50 percent. There has been an alarming increase in crime and corruption. Separatist tendencies and nationalistic conflicts which had been cooled by the cold war are getting hot again, ranging from bloody war in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia to confrontation over minority rights in the Baltic states.
But despite these overwhelming odds, the conventional wisdom of most of the American media that the Russian democracy is doomed is off the mark. There is still strong support for reform among political leaders and the Russian people. The real political battle today is not between reformers and reactionaries, but between different kinds of reforms.
There are those like Mr. Yeltsin who prefer to act swiftly and decisively, and those like the Civic Union which would rather move more gradually. The fact that all political leaders except for the extreme reactionaries pay at least lip service to a free market economy means there will be no turning back to Communism.
The negative news from Russia has completely obscured the positive news. Just as Washington is not America, Moscow is not Russia. While political infighting is big news in Moscow, privatization and growth are proceeding irreversibly in other parts of Russia. Twenty percent of the G.N.P. is now produced by private enterprise. More than 30 percent of Russian workers are in private enterprise. The press is free. Privatizing the economy has helped to eliminate shortages. No one talks about the possibility of starvation, as was the case when I was in Moscow just nine months ago.
Most important, as experts like James Billington and Gerald Corrigan have pointed out, the caricature that Russian workers are not responding to economic incentives is false. In a meeting in St. Petersburg two weeks ago, private entrepreneurs unanimously agreed that, when given the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of a free society, Russian workers are among the best in the world. They are also among the best educated: Ninety percent have graduated from high school -- a higher percentage than in the United States.
Can Boris Yeltsin survive? Some Western leaders I talked to question it. Some of his opponents in Russia doubt it. Most shocking, the State Department officer who was in charge of aid to Russia publicly predicted last month that he would not last. With friends like that, Mr. Yeltsin needs no enemies.
His approval rating is down sharply because of the economic downturn. But he is still the most popular politician in Russia. He has made serious mistakes in dealing with the Parliament he inherited from Mikhail Gorbachev. But while revolutionary leaders are generally good at destroying old orders but not good at governing new ones, Mr. Yeltsin has surprised even his critics by his political skill in handling what must be the most difficult political position in the world.
To his credit, he is attempting to find a compromise with the Parliament rather than becoming authoritarian, as many predicted. Those who would count him out should bear in mind that he has remarkable recuperative powers. He is a fighter. When he seems to be down and out, he gets up and continues the battle.
Most important, President Yeltsin shares our values. Unlike Mr. Gorbachev, he has repudiated both socialism and Communism, believes in a free market and supports the private ownership of property. Mr. Yeltsin unequivocally supports a non-aggressive foreign policy. After meeting all the major leaders in Russia, I am convinced that our choice is not between him and somebody better, but between him and someone worse. He deserves our help, both to further our interests as well as his.
In addition to increasing aid, President Clinton should consider calling for an emergency meeting of the Group of Seven major nations. The crisis in Russia should be at the top of the agenda. He should take the lead in persuading our allies, particularly the Germans and Japanese, to join us in rescheduling for 15 years the $84 billion debt Mr. Yeltsin inherited from Mr. Gorbachev.
Shortsighted Western governments and bankers have to face up to the fact that if the debt is not rescheduled, they are likely to get nothing from any government which replaces Mr. Yeltsin's. We should demand that the bureaucrats running the International Monetary Fund not treat Russia like a third world country.
We should insist that the allies we helped recover from World War II now help Russia and the other independent nations in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union recover from the cold war. The Germans have their plate full with eastern Germany. But the Japanese participation in the multilateral aid program is shockingly inadequate. The Japanese should quit conditioning aid on Russia's return of four tiny northern islands. If Mr. Yeltsin fails, they will never get the islands back.
Why should we even consider aid to Russia in view of our problems at home? Because aid to a non-aggressive democratic Government in Russia is an investment in peace. Russia is the only nation which has the power to destroy the United States. Russian diplomatic support in hot spots like Iraq, the Mideast and Bosnia is indispensable.
During the cold war, many thought the Soviets were evil. None thought they were crazy. That can't be said for some of the smaller nations trying to acquire nuclear weapons. Russia and America, as the only two nuclear superpowers, must play the crucial role in preventing proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Aid to a free-market economy in Russia is an investment in prosperity for the United States. Consider these facts. Russian G.N.P. last year was seven times as great as China's. China's trade with the U.S. was eight times as great as Russia's. Why? Because China's private enterprise produces over one-half of its G.N.P. Russia's private enterprise produces only one-fifth of its G.N.P. As Russia's private sector grows, this will mean thousands of jobs and billions in trade for the U.S.
Even greater stakes are involved. For 75 years, Communist Russia, as a major Soviet state, tried to export Communism to the rest of the world. Today, democratic Russia can serve as a powerful example of how political and economic freedom is the best choice for nations who want to progress. If political and economic freedom fails in Russia, this will encourage the reactionary leaders of other nations to resist reform. If it succeeds, this could have a major impact on a nation like China, which has significant economic reform but no political reform.
Above all, it is time to quit treating Russia like a defeated enemy. Russia did not lose the cold war. The Communists did. The U.S. and our allies deserve great credit for maintaining the military and economic power to resist and turn back the Soviet aggression. A democratic Russia deserves credit for delivering the knockout blow to Communism in its motherland. Russia should be treated as a proud struggling friend, not as a weak former enemy looking for a handout.
The demise of Soviet Communism was one of mankind's greatest victories. But the victory will not be complete until Russia and its neighbors can enjoy the benefits of political and economic freedom. It would be tragic if, at this critical point, the United States fails to provide the leadership only it can provide. By leading abroad as he has so effectively at home, President Clinton will establish himself as the world's pre-eminent statesman.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
Low Interest on Margin Loans Makes Them Attractive

BYLINE: By Andree Brooks

 BODY:
Many new investors in stocks, bonds and mutual funds do not know that there may be untapped borrowing power in their assets.
So-called margin loans against the value of a portfolio may be made for any purpose. Once established, such a loan operates like a line of credit. "It's an excellent way to borrow money," said Lewis J. Altfest, president of L. J. Altfest & Company, financial planners in New York City. 
 The interest rate, which varies according to the size of the loan, is lower than the rates on almost any other kind of borrowing. Currently, margin loans are being offered at around 6.75 percent for sums under $25,000 and 5.75 percent for over $50,000.
This compares with unsecured personal loans averaging 15.77 percent, credit card balances at 18.24 percent and auto loans at 8.72 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor of North Palm Beach, Fla. And monthly interest can be added to the balance or paid from the portfolio's dividends and interest.
It's also easy to qualify because the broker retains the right to liquidate the pledged portion of the portfolio any time the maximum allowable debt-to-assets ratio is exceeded.
In addition, the interest charges may be tax deductible, but this advantage is linked to a complex set of Internal Revenue Service regulations that tie deductibility to the use of the funds. Thus deductibility should never be the prime reason for choosing a margin loan, Mr. Altfest said.
If you intend to use the money to finance other investments, the interest charges should be tax deductible, said James Sharp, a tax partner with Arthur Andersen & Co. But if the loan is financing a car, the interest is not likely to qualify. Since other restrictions also apply, a tax adviser should be consulted before making any assumptions. "So much will depend on your personal financial circumstances," Mr. Sharp said.
Margin borrowing is also limited by Federal Reserve Board regulations to around 50 percent of the value of a portfolio. A portfolio of $100,000 would generate around $50,000 worth of borrowing power. The $50,000 limit however, could rise or fall with market fluctuations and additional limits set by the brokerage.
If the value fell below acceptable levels, the broker could insist that the borrower add to the portfolio or reduce the size of the loan, said Donna Morris, a senior vice president at Fidelity Investments.
Financial advisers advocate conservative use. "I don't recommend going above 25 percent of whatever's available," Mr. Altfest said.
Margin borrowing is not usually permitted against retirement accounts like I.R.A.'s and Keoghs.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
The Clinton Stake in Rostenkowski's Fate

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
In public they talk about economic stimulus, energy taxes, Medicare cuts and the proper ratio of tax increases to spending reductions.
But in the privacy of White House offices and Capitol cloakrooms, President Clinton's top economic advisers and the senators and representatives responsible for pushing the Clinton economic plan through Congress express a bigger worry: Will Dan Rostenkowski be indicted? 
 "The fate of the plan could lie in the balance," said a top Administration official.
 
Out of Their Control
 A Congressman called it "the Damocles' sword that hangs over everything ahead."
What they find most frustrating is that they have no facts about the situation and no control over it.
Mr. Rostenkowski, a Democrat from Chicago and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is probably the single most important lawmaker on economic and social policy issues. All legislation on taxes, Social Security, health care, welfare, unemployment compensation and most other items high on Mr. Clinton's agenda must originate in Mr. Rostenkowski's committee. A masterly legislator and unwavering supporter of Mr. Clinton, he is also perhaps the President's strongest hand in Congress.
But for a year Mr. Rostenkowski has been under investigation by a grand jury led by Jay B. Stephens, the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, a Republican who once worked in the Reagan White House.
If Mr. Rostenkowski is indicted, he must step aside as committee chairman, and the consensus in the Administration and in Congress is that no one else is remotely his equal when it comes to managing a fractious committee and handling controversial legislation.
Representative Sam M. Gibbons would become acting chairman in Mr. Rostenkowski's absence. He is a Democrat from Florida in his 16th term who has specialized in trade issues and has never become heavily involved in matters like taxes and health policy.
The Rostenkowski case initially involved his office's purchase of an unusually large number of stamps from the House post office and the apparent suspicion by the authorities that this was part of a money-laundering scheme to convert campaign donations and office expenses into personal funds. Recently, the investigation seems to have been expanded into other financial areas. Subpoenas have been issued for virtually all of Mr. Rostenkowski's financial records, personal and political.
Mr. Rostenkowski, who is 65, says he has done nothing wrong, has no idea what the prosecutors are looking for and is the victim of a political witch hunt. He says his lawyers have been told that he is not a target of the investigation. Indeed, no solid evidence of illegal activity by Mr. Rostenkowski has become public.
His friends say they cannot imagine that he had his hand in the petty-cash drawer. He could have retired and not run for re-election last year and kept more than $1 million in leftover campaign funds, the last year it was legally possible to do so. If he were crooked, supporters said, he could have found lobbyists in town who would have backed up a Brinks truck to his office and dropped off whatever loot he wanted.
 
An Aggressive Prosecutor
 But Mr. Stephens, who has said little about the case publicly, appears to have something, and he is pursuing it with an aggressiveness that seems to indicate that he thinks he can win an indictment. Time magazine reported last week, without saying where the information came from, that an indictment was expected this spring or summer.
If it happens, Mr. Clinton will lose the strong arm of perhaps Congress's most skillful manipulator of the legislative process. "Rostenkowski has an enormous talent for moving Congress in the direction he wants to take it," said a Senator who has dealt with him for years in House-Senate conferences to work out the differences in important legislation.
The situation is so ticklish that this Senator and the other officials and lawmakers interviewed would discuss it only on the condition that their names not appear in the article.
The main source of Mr. Rostenkowski's strength is the loyalty his fellow Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee feel toward him. Years of mastering the substance and politics of the tax code, of passing out political rewards and punishment, of carefully testing the waters so he knows where each member stands on every issue have left him in a position in which he almost never loses a vote in his committee.
With Mr. Rostenkowski as chairman, it is a safe bet that the House will approve Mr. Clinton's economic plan mostly the way the President proposed it. But if Mr. Rostenkowski is indicted, all bets are off.
Under the rules of House Democrats, committee chairmen who are indicted on felony charges must give up the chairmanship until the matter is settled, and the Democratic committee member with the most seniority automatically becomes acting chairman. That is Mr. Gibbons.
The current thinking is that if Mr. Rostenkowski is forced to step aside, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, a member of the Ways and Means Committee until he was elected majority leader in 1989, would move in and become the chairman in fact, though not in name.
But even Mr. Gephardt does not have Mr. Rostenkowski's ability to force his will on the committee. And no one knows whether Mr. Gibbons would willingly turn over authority to the Democratic leader or how the Rostenkowski loyalists on the committee staff would respond.
What frustrates Administration officials most is that they do not have any feel for the prospects of an indictment. With no Attorney General, no one can go to the prosecutor and get a rundown. Officials said that it would be improper for Mr. Clinton or others in his Administration to put pressure on Mr. Stephens or even to learn the facts of the case and that no one in the Administration would do so. But they said that as a practical matter an Attorney General might be able to get a general idea of the likelihood of an indictment.
"We need to know whether we have to have a Plan B," an official said.

HEADLINE: Some Senate Democrats Push More Spending Cuts

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
Moderate and conservative Senate Democrats, who hold the swing votes to pass or modify President Clinton's economic package, are pressing the Administration for more budget cuts.
Specifically, they want Mr. Clinton to slash his proposed $31 billion package of new spending and tax cuts intended to stimulate the economy, and they want him to tie any new spending to further budget cuts. 
 The Democrats in question, who number about a dozen, still publicly support the Administration plan, and even the most critical have so far shunned alliances with Republicans. But behind the scenes they are organizing a quiet effort to change the plan, leveraged by the unspoken threat of a defection if they do not win concessions.
The group is important because Democrats hold a 57-to-43 majority in the Senate, and Democratic leaders do not expect any Republican support for Mr. Clinton's plan. So far, public opinion polls have shown widespread approval of the package, and Democratic Senators have gone out of their way to express firm support for it.
But the group of conservative-leaning Senators, led by David L. Boren of Oklahoma, is now warning the Administration that its economic plan will not cut the deficit enough to convince voters two or four years from now that tax increases were worth the pain.
"The bloom will wear off by the time the votes come," said Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona. "If it's a party vote, the President can't afford to lose eight votes. I think there are four votes already in question."
The Senators insist that they want to help Mr. Clinton, but they say they also need compromises.
"My vote is secure, but I have not made a blood oath to anybody," said Senator Charles S. Robb of Virginia.
Some in the group, facing tough re-election fights in 1994 and fearing that the public will turn on Democrats after taxes go up, want to be seen as fiscal hawks. Others oppose particular projects like the space station and the superconducting supercollider. Still others oppose a proposed energy tax, or would like to reduce new Social Security taxes along with new spending. The most conservative of the group would eliminate the spending package entirely, while others would attach it to spending cuts.
On Tuesday, eight of the Democratic Senators sent a letter to President Clinton, urging him to retreat from his strategy of passing tax cuts and spending programs before taking up legislation known as the reconciliation bill, which includes the budget cuts and tax increases.
 
Timing Is Questioned
 "The trust and support of the American people is fragile," the letter warned. "The timing and sequence of a series of actions can be critical to the success or failure of the effort."
The White House signaled today it had no intention of bowing to these Senators. "I don't think it is a big deal," a senior Administration official said of the letter. "It's an honest difference on tactics."
But it was clear that the initiative by these Senators is only the first warning shot in what are certain to be concerted efforts to satisfy constituents and regional concerns. Five western Democratic Senators are organizing to alter the proposed energy tax and cuts in agricultural subsidies, and the westerners are discussing the option of joining forces with the conservatives to increase their bargaining power.
 
Support From Liberals
 Despite the Democratic rumblings and the drop in the unemployment rate in February, President Clinton, meeting with mayors today, reaffirmed his commitment to the full stimulus package. His position has been bolstered by Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the powerful chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and by liberals who favor creating jobs with programs like Head Start.
The group of Senators who are pushing for changes are framing their efforts as an attempt to protect the President from the left wing of the party.
"We want to let Clinton be Clinton," said Mr. Boren, who convened a meeting of eight conservative Democrats on Feb. 25 to establish a united front for negotiations with the Administration. "We don't want to let the traditionally entrenched, big-spending liberals steal the momentum away from the President's commitment to deficit reduction."
Mr. Boren was careful to compliment Mr. Clinton for preparing what he called the most honest budget created by any President in years, adding that he is convinced that Mr. Clinton is serious about reducing the deficit.
So far, Democratic leaders have managed to hold onto the votes of moderate and conservative Senators. Some of them considered voting for a Republican amendment this week that would have tied budget cuts to the extension of unemployment compensation, but they demurred after Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said the vote was vital to the President.
After the party-line vote, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, said he thought several Democrats would eventually cooperate with his party's push for more budget cuts and fewer taxes.
The core of the group of Democratic Senators includes Mr. Boren, Mr. DeConcini, Mr. Robb, Jim Exon of Nebraska, Herb Kohl of Wisconsin and Richard C. Shelby of Alabama. They are being supported, to varying degrees, by Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Howell Heflin of Alabama, Kent Conrad of North Dakota, John B. Breaux of Louisiana, J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina and Sam Nunn of Georgia.
Mr. Boren said in an interview on Thursday that he believed the Administration was listening and that the White House would make changes in an energy tax. He said in its current form, the tax would burden independent oil and gas operators and would be "devastating" to his state. "I'm the swing vote on the Finance Committee," he said, smiling but not joking.
Mr. Boren said he was confident the President's economic program would eventually pass, but he added, "What could stop it from flying is if the public perceives that we're slipping back in our old ways of spend now and cut the deficit later, if ever."

HEADLINE: U.S. PLANNING AID TO HELP SHORE UP YELTSIN'S POSITION

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
In an effort to bolster President Boris N. Yeltsin's political position, the White House is considering offering him loan guarantees to house demobilized Russian troops and an enterprise fund to support emerging Russian capitalists, senior Administration officials said today.
These ideas are being considered as part of what President Clinton said would be "some innovative solutions" for aiding Russia that he will propose to President Yeltsin when the two meet next month, officials said. Mr. Clinton announced today that the meeting would be held in Vancouver, British Columbia, on April 3 and 4. 
 "I will try to be rather specific at that time in terms of what the United States will be prepared to do," Mr. Clinton said in announcing the location.
 
Concern About Yeltsin
 Administration officials said Mr. Clinton's early thinking on Russian policy is being guided in part by an assessment that President Yeltsin is in an increasingly perilous political state, and that both he and the Russian reformers allied to him need a commitment of assistance that will be visible and whose impact will be felt reasonably quickly.
The President said he shares the views being expressed by former President Richard Nixon about the need for a much more forceful American response to help Mr. Yeltsin. Mr. Clinton telephoned Mr. Nixon two days ago, and the two spoke for 30 minutes about the fate of Russia. Mr. Clinton invited Mr. Nixon, who recently visited Russia, to meet him in the White House on Monday to present some concrete proposals, aides said.
Administration policy makers say that the Clinton approach to Russian-American relations will place a strong emphasis on sending Americans to Russia to help develop private businesses and democratic institutions rather than on waiting for the huge, multinational assistance packages. Mr. Clinton's approach reflects an assessment that the only way change is going to come to Russia is from the ground up -- "by changing the way that people there do business," as one official put it.
"The idea," the official added, "is to promote real markets, real capitalism and private businesses on the ground. While the Russian Government has been having its problems, the fact is it has also allowed an enormous amount of privatization to take place and we have to nurture that."
 
Loans for Housing
 Among the ideas being considered by the Administration to offer Mr. Yeltsin at the summit, the most ambitious would be to establish an enterprise fund for Russia. The Bush Administration set up similar funds for Eastern European countries.
Another option under consideration would be housing loan guarantees -- similar to those granted to Israel last year -- to allow Russia to obtain low-interest loans from private banks to alleviate the critical shortage of housing for the hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers demobilized from Eastern Europe, officials said.
Both of these options could be paid for out of the $300 million in additional assistance for Russia that Mr. Clinton is seeking in his new budget.
In addition, say aides, the President is likely to offer Mr. Yeltsin an increase from the 200 Peace Corps volunteers who have been sent to Russia and a large expansion of the farmer-to-farmer program, which sends American farmers to Russia to work directly with their Russian counterparts.
Also likely to be expanded will be the number of American advisers being sent over to teach Russians how to privatize a business and how to set up democratic institutions.
In part, this approach is making a virtue of necessity. While Mr. Clinton has called for increased world financial support for Russia, his aides have already discovered how complicated that is, given the number of donor nations involved, Russia's default on its debts and the limited resources available.
"These guys came in with the greatest will in the world," a holdover from the Bush Administration said of Mr. Clinton's advisers on Russia. "But they have learned very quickly that it is all much harder than it sounds."
For instance, due to infighting in Russia and disputes over who is responsible for the Soviet Union's debts, a key element of the $24 billion assistance package promised last year by the United States and the other Group of Seven industrial democracies has never been delivered: the $6 billion fund to stabilize the ruble.
 
Conditions for Commitment
 Clinton aides insist that the President is committed to taking the lead in widening the Group of Seven aid package and in working more aggressively to reschedule the $80 billion Russian foreign debt.
But Mr. Clinton has told aides he is not going even to consider funding any huge financial schemes unless the allies support them and unless Russia sets up a viable monetary structure to insure that American taxpayer dollars will not be siphoned off by mismanagement, inflation or corruption.
All this leaves a classic chicken-and-egg situation, aides say: Mr. Yeltsin is unwilling to close down bankrupt state enterprises and to stop printing money unless he is certain that he has the Western safety net. The United States and its allies have been insisting that on reform first.
In discussions with American officials involved in Russia policy, though, it is possible to hear the faint beginnings of a debate on the question of how many conditions should be attached to large-scale financial aid to Russia. Mr. Nixon and some policy makers are beginning to muse aloud that Mr. Yeltsin's situation is becoming so desperate that the United States and its allies should consider "lowering the goal posts a bit," as one official put it.
"It may mean we have to take some more risks than we did before, because the situation is so dangerous, and so close to the brink," said an American diplomat.
Some diplomats say the real policy issue Mr. Clinton is going to have to face is whether to risk losing a portion of American aid in an effort to rescue Mr. Yeltsin before he is washed away on a tide of debased Russian currency. No one disputes that nurturing capitalism and democracy through grass-roots projects will have a major impact in the long run, these analysts add, but the whole process could be undercut if Mr. Yeltsin were to be toppled by nationalists or old-line Communists.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Declines to 7% In Payroll Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
Surpassing all expectations, employers added 365,000 workers to their payrolls in February, the biggest jump in four years, as the unemployment rate edged down a tenth of a point to 7 percent, the Labor Department said today.
The report, the first broad gauge of the economy's performance last month, ran counter to recent doubts about the vigor of the economic expansion, in which job growth has lagged behind improvement in other areas. 
 Bond prices fell, raising interest rates, and stocks rose after the report came out, but both markets closed little changed. [Pages 35 and 36.]
 
Unemployment Drops in City
 The New York City job picture also brightened in February. In January, the city jobless rate had hit the highest level in 25 years. [Page 47.]
Today's figures brought fresh optimism about an economy that had appeared of late to be losing much of its momentum. Consumer confidence, which soared after Election Day, has ebbed, and growth of incomes and personal spending slowed in January while home sales slumped. And an Agriculture Department survey published early this week found that 10.4 percent of the American population was relying on food stamps in December, the highest percentage since the program began in 1964.
But today's report particularly impressed private analysts because of the breadth of the labor-market improvement last month and the fact that the increase in jobs was reflected in the two separate Labor Department surveys. Job gains shown in the results of surveys taken of individual households matched those found in surveys of employers.
The strong numbers also sharpened the debate over President Clinton's proposed $31 billion package of tax cuts and spending to stimulate the economy. Various economists and Republican legislators seized on the figures to underscore their contention that the stimulus is no longer needed.
 But the President and Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, disputed this view and insisted that they would press ahead.
"That is good news," Mr. Clinton said at a meeting with the nation's mayors, referring to the job growth and the decline in the unemployment rate. "But if you look behind the numbers," he continued, "it also reveals the stark challenges before us, for most of those jobs were part-time jobs and we are still about three million jobs behind where we would ordinarily be in a recovery."
Indeed, the number of part-time workers who said they would have preferred full-time jobs climbed by 348,000 in the month, more than 90 percent of the gain of 380,000 jobs shown in the survey of households.
But most analysts considered this a small caveat in a very strong report, since part-time workers, according to Thomas J. Plewes, a Labor Department official, averaged 27 hours of work a week, close to the department's definition of a full-time workweek: 35 hours or more.
Mr. Reich said at a briefing that there was "absolutely" no intention of retreating from the fiscal-stimulus plan, which, among other things, is to create 700,000 summer jobs for young people.
But Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, called the report "just another reason why we shouldn't threaten the ongoing Bush recovery by adding $16 billion in so-called stimulus spending to the deficit."
 
Peaked at 7.7%
 The jobless rate has now fallen seven-tenths of a point since it peaked at 7.7 percent in June, the last month in which it rose. February's rate was the lowest since November 1991.
The report showed that the number of people out of work six months or more fell only slightly, after dropping 155,000 in January. But those without jobs for 15 to 26 weeks fell by 171,000, and the newly unemployed -- those who were jobless for less than 5 weeks -- fell by 40,000.
Another sign of improvement was a hefty rise in the number of people who quit jobs, rather than losing them through layoffs or discharges. Voluntary resignations are thought to reflect confidence about finding a new job. The number of people who left their jobs totaled 1,046,000 in February, 225,000 more than in January.
While manufacturing jobs rose by a modest 10,000, less than in January, the length of the factory workweek inched up another six minutes, to the highest level since 1966. And factory overtime, up 12 minutes last month, was the most since overtime records began being kept in the mid-1950's.
 When business is picking up, employers tend to add overtime for current workers before hiring new ones. Thus, the report released today was doubly encouraging, analysts said.
"This is the first time when we saw a blockbuster report in which hours worked and employment both rose," said Paul W. Boltz, economist at T. Rowe Price Associates, the Baltimore mutual fund group.
Regionally, the unemployment rate fell three-tenths of a point in the Northeast, to 7.6 percent, and four-tenths of a point in the South, to 6.4 percent. But it was unchanged in the West, at 8.3 percent, and the rate rose two-tenths of a point in the Midwest, to match the South at 6.4 percent.
 
Jersey Rate Is Higher
 Among the 11 populous states for which figures were published today, the jobless rate eased five-tenths of a point in New York, to 8 percent, and five-tenths in Pennsylvania, to 7 percent. The rate moved up four-tenths of a point, to 7.8 percent, in New Jersey. Because of relatively small state samples, however, the changes were not statistically significant.
The jump in national payrolls was concentrated in the retail trade and in services, each of which added 131,000 jobs, and in construction, where a 96,000 rise more than offset small declines related to unusually harsh weather that dampened building from November through January.
Temporary help accounted for much of the growth in business services. Like overtime, expansion of temporary help is often a precursor of new hiring.
"It is clear that the job market strengthened considerably in February," William G. Barron Jr., the Acting Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said in his monthly appearance to interpret the jobs data to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
January payrolls were revised downward by 46,000 jobs, roughly halving the 106,000 increase that was initially reported.
 
60% Add Workers
 Other figures from the employer survey showed that 60.1 percent of industries added workers in February, up from 55.1 percent in January.
The index of aggregate weekly production hours climbed to 122.5, from 121.9, indicating that industrial output will be up smartly for February when reported in midmonth.
Among the few noteworthy changes among demographic groups, according to the survey of households, was a four-tenths of a point decline, to 6 percent, in the jobless rate for adult women. The rate for blacks fell 1.1 points, to 13.1 percent.
The total jobless ranks thinned by 136,000 in the month, less than the amount of the job gains because the work force expanded by 244,000.

HEADLINE: Poles Get Lessons With Their Loans

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

 BODY:
When Robert G. Faris first went to Poland two years ago with $240 million from Congress to make loans to entrepreneurs, he had to develop a brochure for borrowers that explained what a loan was and the responsibility of paying it back.
He found that Polish builders possessed fantasies about capitalism so grandiose that they designed inappropriately luxurious houses. And when he decided to open a mortgage bank to stimulate badly needed home construction, the Polish Parliament had to be lobbied for a law that allowed the eviction of defaulters. 
 Despite these challenges, his operation, the Polish-American Enterprise Fund, has disbursed $102 million and made commitments on another $78 million. It has been so successful that new investors have been attracted to help it make further investments.
 
More Money Coming
 In December, the pension funds of the General Electric Company and some other American corporations joined with Creditanstalt Bankverein of Austria and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to create a $150 million private equity fund for investment in Poland, called the Polish Private Equity Fund.
"I was very impressed with Poland and its private sector, which is thriving," Rosemary Sagar, a vice president of General Electric Investments, said about her recent visit there. "The Poles are very entrepreneurial. The private sector is larger than in Hungary and Czechoslovakia and is offsetting the shrinking state sector."
She said that even though G.E.'s investment was tiny -- it has put only $5 million in the new fund -- it offered an opportunity to assess business developments in Poland.
With a population of 40 million and a strategic position between the former Soviet Union and Germany, Poland also has an effective Polish-American lobby in Washington. When Congress allocated investment money for Eastern Europe three years ago, it appropriated $240 million for Poland, and only $60 million each for Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
 
Filling the Top Posts

 
 The Bush Administration appointed John P. Birkelund, chairman of the Dillon, Read securities firm, to head the Polish-American fund. Mr. Faris, president of Alan Patricof Associates, a venture capital firm in New York, was made the fund's president.
When Mr. Faris and his colleagues arrived in Warsaw, they were besieged by loan applicants. With Polish banks lending to entrepreneurs at an interest rate of 70 percent, it was hardly surprising that energetic Poles with business ideas lined up for blocks outside those banks that were offering loans from the American fund at 12 percent. Initially, so many credit-starved Poles lined up for loans that overwhelmed bank managers insisted the program be closed.
Both Mr. Birkelund and Mr. Faris said their main criterion in choosing investments was a reasonable likelihood that the business would succeed. It was imperative, they said, that the Poles see examples of capitalism that worked and that the Poles understand that the money from Washington was not a free handout along the lines of a traditional aid program.
"You've got a situation where there was no commercial code, no accounting system, no banking system and no understanding of marketing or financial management," Mr. Faris said.
In two years, the fund has approved loans to more than 1,700 small businesses and made equity investments in more than 30 larger established Polish enterprises. The financings include $15 million for a former state-owned printing plant that was about to be liquidated and $10 million for a furniture maker who managed to survive during the Communist era and needed money to expand.
 
Using Chicago Experience
 To establish the creditworthiness of potential borrowers in a country where creditworthiness was a new idea, the fund brought two officers of the South Shore Bank of Chicago to Poland. The bank has 18 years' experience with lending in inner-city Chicago amid risky financial conditions.
Besides writing the brochure on the A B C's of borrowing, the officers from South Shore helped give lessons in basic customer service to 75 Polish employees at nine regional banks.
The fund's small loans are at a 12 percent interest rate for a maximum of three years.
The fund closed its small-loan program for two months at the end of 1990 because of the large number of poorly qualified applicants, but then reopened it with stricter criteria.
"To qualify for the small loans you have to show capability as a manager, outline a reasonable business plan and demonstrate growth potential and cash flows sufficient to cover the loan and other obligations," Mr. Faris said. "Generally, you have to be more than a beginner."
He was particularly taken by the application of a woman who ran a state-owned laundry that was about to be closed. "She wanted backing for a laundry of her own and demonstrated the demand," he said.
 
A Furniture Entrepreneur
 One of Mr. Faris's favorite investments is the $6 million of equity and $4 million loan provided to Haste International, a furniture manufacturer founded 12 years ago by a tenacious entrepreneur, Stefan Lewandowski. Haste ships products to Germany and Scandinavia and to Ikea, the international household retailer. Ikea's sparkling new outlet in downtown Warsaw is a popular shopping stops for those Poles who have money.
"Stefan Lewandowski is animated and dynamic, a take-charge person," Mr. Faris said. "He has the potential for becoming the biggest furniture maker in Poland; there are state-owned furniture companies up for sale that he can buy. He was short of capital, and this money is for expansion."
Mr. Faris is also optimistic about the fund's equity investment of $350,000 and a loan of $644,000 provided to Qumak International in Cracow in southern Poland. Three young entrepreneurs learned the computer business from Western magazines and started Qumak, a computer distribution business. "I sensed they have management smarts," he said, "and though the computer business is a tough one, I think they are tackling it pretty well."
The fund's equity investments are for long-term capital growth, "typically five to seven years," Mr. Faris said.
As for the small loans, the delinquency rate so far has been low -- just 2 percent. This is a better record than that of most commercial banks in the United States, Mr. Faris said.
Despite the upbeat aspects of frontier entrepreneurship in Poland, there are still many frustrations for Mr. Faris and his associates. Instead of the 60 days it might take to complete a typical deal in the United States, the figure for Poland is more like six months, he said.

HEADLINE: THE TWIN TOWERS: The Suspect;
More Light Is Shed On a Shadowy Life

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, March 5

 BODY:
He apparently lived in this country illegally, squeezed into a small disordered apartment here with three others. Neighbors say he kept to a shadowy life penetrated by few people outside of a tight network of Muslims who shared housing and fraternized with him. Some of these friends seem to have vanished in the last few days.
Mohammed A. Salameh, the 25-year-old man described by the police as an Islamic fundamentalist who was arrested on Thursday morning as the first suspect in the World Trade Center bombing, has lived for about two years in a one-bedroom apartment on an unobtrusive residential street here that he shared with two women and another man, neighbors said. At some point, he may have driven a cab or worked in construction. 
 Neighbors, however, did not know the names of his roommates or what became of them after Mr. Salameh's arrest. The telephone at the apartment, on the ground floor of 34 Kensington Avenue, is listed in the name of Josie Hadas.
Five other Arab men roomed together on the floor above Mr. Salameh's, neighbors said, and were friends of his. The neighbors said those men were evicted from the apartment three or four months ago for not paying their rent. Their whereabouts were also unknown.
 
Many Visitors Recently
 Residents of Kensington Avenue in this working-class neighborhood knew virtually nothing of the lean, bearded Mr. Salameh, other than that he seemed devoutly religious and remote. What English he knew he delivered in a thick accent. He received an intensifying flurry of visitors shortly before the explosion.
Earl Jones, a supervisor for a cleaning company who lives in a house next door to Mr. Salameh's apartment building, said that in the last couple of weeks a number of Arab men frequently visited Mr. Salameh, sometimes in the middle of the night. "There was a lot of night activity," Mr. Jones said. "After one in the morning I would hear the door slam and there would be talking in Arabic that I couldn't understand. This was in the week before the explosion."
Several neighbors in Mr. Salameh's building said they noticed boxes being lugged in and out of his apartment. They assumed it was dishes or papers.
When the Federal authorities searched Mr. Salameh's apartment, they said, they discovered tools, wiring and manuals, implying the presence of a bomb maker. They said that they believe the bomb was planned at the apartment but built elsewhere, and that others were involved.
Last night, investigators found hundreds of pounds of bomb-making chemicals in a locker at a drive-in self-storage warehouse in Jersey City, and Federal officials said that the van rented to Mr. Salameh had been seen by witnesses at the warehouse.
 
Tripped Up by Persistence
 Mr. Salameh was undone by his persistence in trying to retrieve a $400 deposit on a yellow Ryder van that the authorities believe contained the bomb that rocked the World Trade Center. He was arrested Thursday morning after making his third trip to the Jersey City van rental agency.
While some neighbors found Mr. Salameh cordial -- one woman said he would assist her with her groceries -- others said the Arab tenants were frowned on in the building because of unpleasant food odors wafting from their apartments and because of untidy habits.
The extent of Mr. Salameh's connections remain murky, though evidence mounted that he has ties to El Sayyid A. Nosair, an Egyptian in prison for crimes related to the slaying of Rabbi Meir Kahane. One of Mr. Nosair's lawyers said a man named Salameh, who fit the suspect's description, faithfully attended Mr. Nosair's trial in late 1991 in New York.
"When I was in New York for the trial," said the lawyer, Montasser al-Zayat. "I met a young man in his early 20's named Salameh who attended each session with several other young Arab men. I do not know if this Salameh was the man suspected of carrying out the bombing in New York, but the age and the name seem to be the same. The description I have been given of the suspect fits exactly."
When he acquired a New York driver's license last year, Mr. Salameh gave as his address the Brooklyn apartment formerly inhabited by Mr. Nosair. Its current occupant, Ibrahim A. Elgabrowny, a carpenter who is Mr. Nosair's cousin, was arrested Thursday on charges of obstruction of justice. The authorities said he tried to prevent them from searching the apartment.
 
'Liked to Do Favors'
 Lisa Elgabrowny, his wife, said that they had lived in the apartment for nine years and that Mr. Salameh had never visited them. She said she did not know why he gave that address in pursuing a driver's license. "Maybe he was acquainted," she said. She added that her husband liked to do favors for others.
Mr. Salameh worshiped at the Al Salam mosque in Jersey City, and law-enforcement officials believe he is a follower of the blind Muslim cleric who preaches there, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman. The Egyptian Government maintains that he is the spiritual leader of a movement responsible for dozens of violent attacks in Egypt. The sheik was acquitted in Egypt a decade ago in the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat.
According to a Federal official, Mr. Salameh, who carried a Jordanian passport but whose nationality could not be determined, has presumably lived illegally in the United States for more than four-and-a-half years. He entered the country legally on Feb. 17, 1988, with a six-month visitor's visa that had been issued him in Amman, Jordan, in December 1987. That visa expired on Aug. 16, 1988, but the official said there was no evidence that Mr. Salameh had left the United States.
Before he moved to his latest apartment on Kensington Avenue, Mr. Salameh lived nearby on the second floor of an apartment at 26 Weldon Street, sharing that as well with several others, neighbors said. "There would sometimes be like 10 of them living there at the same time," said Lou Lutrario, a 23-year-old unemployed neighbor. "A lot of them were cabdrivers. The cabs would sometimes park out there at 1 A.M. and the drivers would whistle up."
 
Back to Egypt
 Five Egyptians appear to live there now, and neighbors said the place continued to be a haunt of Arab cabdrivers. The Weldon Street apartment was raided by the Federal authorities on Thursday afternoon and neighbors said that two of its occupants -- a man and a woman named Gladys Noore who said she was visiting her boyfriend -- were brought out and questioned by the authorities before being released. Neighbors said that the authorities removed items from the apartment.
Several Egyptians also occupied an adjacent apartment. Neighbors said they had departed for Egypt last week.
Two of the men who now live in Mr. Salameh's former one-bedroom apartment denied knowing the suspect. Two neighbors, however, said he had been spotted in the building recently.
The apartment was sorely in need of housekeeping. The living room contains a cot and a couch arranged for sleeping. The bedroom has two cots and a mattress plopped on the floor. Packed luggage was strewn around the living room.
Hassan Elkhayat, an Egyptian, was asleep on the couch early this afternoon. He spoke hardly any English, but insisted he knew nothing of Mr. Salameh, other than that he previously lived there. He said four other men lived in the apartment with him.
Another man returning to the apartment with a woman said he had been questioned by the Federal authorities but did not know Mr. Salameh.
Aeisha Harreld, a young woman who lives with her children next door, said that she believed Mr. Salameh had been staying at the apartment as recently as a month or two ago. She said she saw him on and off in the laundry room. "He would put money in other people's dryers if they weren't there and the clothes were still wet," she said. "Otherwise, he didn't mess with anybody."
It was unclear how Mr. Salameh supported himself. He said he was a cabdriver on the rental application for his present apartment. The major cab companies in Jersey City, however, said they had never heard of him.
Frank Ferrari, a general partner in Ferarri Investments in Verona, N.J., who is the landlord of Mr. Salameh's Kensington Avenue apartment, said Mr. Salameh rented the apartment about two years ago and had paid the $560 a month rent on time until last month. That payment is still in arrears.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
Clinton Defends Bosnia Airdrops and Vows Tighter Sanctions

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
President Clinton today defended American efforts to provide relief aid to eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina and promised to further tighten sanctions against the delivery of oil and other supplies to Yugoslavia.
"We are exploring and, indeed, are in the process of implementing ways to tighten the embargo, which we will announce very shortly," Mr. Clinton said at the White House. "And I think there are other things we can do." 
 As negotiators at the United Nations continued to work toward reaching a compromise in the peace talks, Mr. Clinton took pains to blame Serbian leaders for any potential derailment.
"I think it will be very interesting for the world to look and see if the Serbians are willing to negotiate in good faith in a process that they have embraced when it suited their short-term strategic interests," Mr. Clinton said. "I hope that they will support it over a longer term. We'll see."
 
Offensive Raises Questions
 The Serbian assault on Muslim towns in eastern Bosnia since the airdrops began has led to questions about their effectiveness.
But White House officials insisted that the existing sanctions and the policy of dropping relief supplies from the air to persuade the Serbs to stop blocking ground convoys have worked.
White House officials announced that the Maria, a vessel carrying Serbian arms that was on its way to deliver them to Somalia, had been detained this morning in the Indian Ocean off the Seychelles. They cited that action as an example of how the embargo was working.
George Stephanopoulos, the White House spokesman, said that four other vessels had been stopped in the last month and that shipments along the Danube had also been slowed.
 
Serbs Seek to Raise Cash
 The American authorities believe that such shipments are used to raise cash and purchase goods in violation of the United Nations embargo.
"The entire effort is designed to crack down on the Serbians, to inflict real pain and real price for the actions they're taking," Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
Mr. Clinton and other officials would not discuss how the existing sanctions might be tightened.
Mr. Clinton said further action in the area depends on the cooperation from European allies and from Russia.
"The United States cannot proceed here unilaterally," he said. "We need the support of the Europeans, who are much closer to the situation and who will be much more immediately impacted by any further adverse instability in the Balkans than we would."
Two teams, from the State and Treasury Departments, have been sent to Europe to devise a plan to intercept both the shipment of goods over land and monetary transfers, Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
"We are producing results when we do anything to limit Serbia's ability to create goods in the long run, when we limit their ability to get finance, financing," he said. "We, over time, will be inhibiting their effort to carry on the aggression."
Mr. Clinton conceded today that the Serbs were making inroads in spite of United Nations embargo and relief efforts. "I don't think there's any question that when the Serbs take an area and then run all the Bosnian Muslims out, then that means that they are succeeding," the President said. "They have succeeded in running some people out of communities."
Mr. Stephanopoulos said: "The aggression is continuing. And it's clearly a matter of concern to the President. There's no question the situation in eastern Bosnia is very serious, and we have to take whatever steps we can to try and pressure Serbia to be good actors at the negotiating table."
 
Airdrop Accuracy Defended
 The White House emphasized today that President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia had expressed support for the airdrops. But Mr. Stephanopoulos said the Administration would continue to review its policies on the aid.
"We will continually reassess our policy," he said. "We talk with our allies. We use our intelligence assessments of what's happening on the ground."
Mr. Clinton stressed, however, that intelligence reports do not support the idea that the airdrops have created more danger than they have relieved.
"The surveillance we've done indicates that there have been actually slightly more accuracy in the drops from the altitude we chose for safety for our pilots than we thought there would be," he said.
"So would I re-examine it if I thought they were doing more harm than good?" the President added. "Of course I would. But I can tell you that I have pressed that point very hard in our meetings, and our people simply dispute the proposition."

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
The Siege, Waco Points Out, Isn't Exactly in Waco

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WACO, Tex., March 5

 BODY:
Waco did not plan on this.
But as a doomsday religious cult and its self-proclaimed Messiah kept hundreds of Federal agents at bay for a sixth day today, this central Texas city of 100,000 people was gamely trying to cope with its worldwide fame as the place where the drama was unfolding. 
 Actually, as city leaders here do not tire of pointing out, their hometown is really not the place. The cult's compound is a few miles east of the city limits, in an unincorporated part of McLennan County.
"Because the incident itself is not happening in Waco, we hope that people will not believe there is a siege in Waco," said Elizabeth A. Taylor, director of the Waco Convention and Visitors Bureau. "Waco is not under siege."
That may be true, but it does seem besieged -- by Federal agents walking around hotels and city streets with semiautomatic guns over their shoulders, by Texas Rangers, reporters and camera crews. And because all briefings for reporters, who are not allowed to go anywhere near the actual siege, are downtown, the name Waco is now firmly linked to the standoff and the gun battle that began it. Four Federal agents and an undetermined number of cult members were killed in the shooting when the authorities raided the compound on Sunday morning.
Many people here concede that the notoriety is inevitable, but they are still unhappy about it. "We're sitting here being the victims, very much like Dallas was with J.F.K.," said John Fletcher, a board member of the Waco Chamber of Commerce. "The people of Waco didn't do anything."
To help counteract bad impressions, city officials posted a notice at the F.B.I. briefing today that provided the local tourist information number. Employees of the visitor's bureau circulated in the crowd to describe the city's 14 museums, a new zoo and other attractions.
And with workers from news organizations being ejected from their hotel rooms by Federal agents or by guests arriving for long-planned conventions here this weekend, the notice offered some Texas-sized hospitality. "Wacoans are opening up their homes to put people up!" it said.
 
Good for Business
 The standoff may be bad for Waco's image, but it has been undeniably good for business.
Every hotel room for miles around is booked, and even with the tension,people have to eat. Local restaurants are often filled. Nobody has an exact count of the law officers, news workers and worried relatives who have thronged the town, but it may be 2,000 and perhaps many more.
"Any time this many people are in town, it has a dramatic impact on the economy," one city official said. "You all are here and you all are spending money."
If anything, there is too much business. Hotel operators have been told to let Federal agents remain in their rooms even if that means bumping people with reservations.
This weekend alone, the Texas Association of Baptist Schools is holding a conference here; the Texas-New Mexico Junior College Basketball Tournament, which drawn 16 teams along with their fans, is being fought in town and an Arabian Horse Show is on at the Texas State Fairgrounds.
 
Mystery Truck
 Out along a rural highway, at the edge of a pasture that is the closest to the compound that reporters are allowed to go, there are long stretches of quiet punctuated by an occasional burst of frenzy when a vehicle zooms away from the compound, about two miles away, and heads toward the crowd of waiting reporters.
The other night, a large white-paneled truck could be seen in the distance, making its way from the compound area in a chilly drizzle. Camera crews took to the ready, and rumors started whirling. It was children being released; it was adult cult members who had surrendered; it was a makeshift hearse carrying bodies of Branch Davidians killed in the shootout.
As it turned out, the truck belonged to Michna's Barbecue (Catering and Custom Cooking), which had made a delivery to a shift of hungry Federal agents watching the compound.
 
Metaphorical Messiah
 His business card says, "Messiah." He told his followers on audio tape: "If the Bible is true, then I'm Christ." But in recent days, negotiators who have spoken by telephone with David Koresh, the cult's leader, say he has taken considerable offense at the portrayal of him as man who believes he is Jesus.
"He describes himself as a prophet," Bob Ricks, an F.B.I. agent, said at a news briefing today. Although Mr. Ricks did not elaborate, other officials trying to work out an end to the crisis said Mr. Koresh had suggested that in comparing himself to Jesus, he was speaking metaphorically, not literally.
Negotiators confirmed that they had brought in biblical scholars to help in talks with Mr. Koresh. "There are long discussions regarding religion, long readings of the Scriptures," said Jeffrey Jamar, the F.B.I. agent in charge of the entire field operation.
Mr. Koresh seems most interested in discussing the Bible, officials say, and frequently becomes angry or even hangs up when the negotiators try to steer the conversation back toward releasing people inside or ending the entire affair. The cult leader, who reneged on a promise to surrender after his 58-minute monologue was broadcast on Tuesday, insists that he will go only when he hears God tell him to.
 
Uncertain Body Count
 How many dead are inside the compound? Some newspapers, quoting people familiar with accounts from children who were inside, are saying the number could be as high as 20.
Officials of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have confirmed only two deaths inside, in addition to the four agents outside. On Thursday, the authorities used armored vehicles for cover when they went to recover the second body, that of a man near the compound who was found still clutching a gun.
On Friday morning, an arrangement was worked out for Federal agents to remove the bodies of two dead dogs killed in the gunfire, after Mr. Koresh reportedly said some of his followers were complaining about the smell and unsanitary conditions.The agents also took away a live goose that escaped at the time.
But aside from Mr. Koresh's early unconfirmed report that a 2-year-old child had died in the shootout, Federal officials have offered no formal count, first- or second-hand, of how many people may be dead inside, and the truth seems to be that the people in charge simply do not know.

HEADLINE: Unemployment at 11.3% As New York City Gains

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate fell sharply in February, to 11.3 percent, Labor Department figures showed yesterday. That was a significant improvement from the January rate of 13.4 percent, which was the highest figure in 25 years.
While February's rate was still in line with the recessionary levels that have persisted since summer, it was a strong indication that January's rate was a seasonal spike caused by layoffs after the Christmas season in the retail and construction fields and the continued shrinkage of the financial and service industries, Federal labor officials said. 
 "We're still bumping along the bottom that was reached last summer, and our fears that January was a new bottom were happily not realized," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "But we do find that February's figures are more encouraging and show a slight improvement in the economy, even though they are half again higher than the national average."
 
 
Not Seasonally Adjusted
 The city's unemployment figure, unlike those for states, is not seasonally adjusted and thus does not include the statistical smoothing that compensates for seasonal jumps or monthly variations in the labor force or the economy.
But the Office of the New York City Comptroller calculates an adjusted unemployment figure for the city, which it said was 11.2 percent in February, down sharply from the 12.8 percent it reported for January.
"Just as we predicted, the January rate was a fluke," said David Neustadt, a spokesman for the comptroller's office.
All told, there were 379,000 New Yorkers out of work in February, down from 447,000 in January but nearly the same as the unemployment levels that have prevailed for the previous five months. The figures exclude those who have dropped out of the city labor market and are not actively seeking work.
The number of employed increased by 82,000, to 2,982,000, after a decrease of similar magnitude in January. The total labor force, including both the employed and unemployed, and those actively seeking jobs, totaled 3,361,000, little changed from January.
 
 
A Tie for Highest Rate
 Compared with other metropolitan areas, Mr. Ehrenhalt said the eight counties in lower New York that make up the Labor Department's New York metropolitan regional grouping ranked with the Riverside-San Bernardino region of Southern California as having the highest unemployment levels in the country.
"The New York metropolitan region is at, or close, to the top," Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
The national unemployment rate in February was 7 percent, down slightly from 7.1 percent in January. The rate in New Jersey was 7.8 percent, compared with 7.4 percent in January, and 8 percent in New York State, compared with 8.5 percent in the two previous months.
The February unemployment rate in Connecticut was unavailable. But the January figure, released yesterday, was 7.5 percent, and did not reflect the thousands of imminent layoffs announced by some of the big military contractors in the state.

British Sell Computer To U.S. Lab

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 5

 BODY:
In a controversial decision that raises national security and economic competitiveness issues, one of the nation's leading weapons laboratories is buying an unproven supercomputer from the American branch of a British company rather than from one of several American companies.
The decision by the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, an Energy Department scientific research and weapons-design center east of here, to buy the $15 million computer from the British company, Meiko World Inc., sent shock waves through the highly competitive supercomputer industry. 
 The super-fast computers are capable of the billions of calculations a second required by weapons designers, scientists and commercial engineers. It had been widely believed that only American and Japanese manufacturers were in the race to build such machines.
 
Deal With Israel
 Livermore's decision, which was disclosed by several computer industry officials today, raised particular questions about national security. In 1991, Meiko sold supercomputers to an Israeli educational institution that was reportedly involved with the design of nuclear weapons. The United States has been unsuccessful in trying to persuade European governments to sign a treaty between the United States and Japan that controls the export of supercomputers to foreign governments.
The Livermore contract is seen as contributing to Meiko's ability to develop machines that foreign countries can use to develop nuclear weapons.
"These are American tax dollars that shouldn't be spent in lowering our national security by pumping up a company that has a bad export record," said Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control in Washington. "The result of the sale is going to make this dangerous exporter more of a danger."
In late January, Livermore notified several American supercomputer makers that it had selected a massively parallel supercomputer designed by the Meiko Scientific Corporation, based in Waltham, Mass., for a classified weapons-related application.
Livermore refused to identify the other bidders for the contract or discuss its details, but industry executives familiar with the program said that in addition to Meiko, a number of United States companies -- including the Thinking Machines Corporation, the Intel Scientific Corporation, the Ncube Corporation and several other computer makers -- had made bids.
Meiko Scientific is a wholly owned subsidiary of Meiko World, which also owns Meiko Scientific Ltd., a supercomputer maker in Bristol, England. Meiko World is owned by six British citizens and has some 140 employees.
"I'm stunned that they would make this choice," said Jack Dongarra, a computer scientist at the University of Tennessee who is an expert in measuring computer performance. "Meiko doesn't have an established track record compared to others in the field."
 
Meets Components Test
 The decision to select Meiko satisfies the Federal law requiring that the component content of such a machine be more than 50 percent American made. But the move has led several competitors to charge that the deal is an economic threat to the United States supercomputer industry, already facing heavy competition from Japan.
"We're blown away that Meiko won," said one United States supercomputer executive, who insisted that he not be identified. "It's one thing to lose a sale in Europe, it's another thing to lose at a national laboratory right after Vice President Gore has made a speech saying that we're going to use the power of the Government to make United States industry more competitive."
The award also raises concerns about the control of advanced computer technologies that could potentially be used by foreign countries to design nuclear weapons or other advanced weapons.
Mr. Milhollin of the Wisconsin Project said that the sale of two moderately powered supercomputers by Meiko to the Technion, an Israeli University, in 1991 had permitted the Israelis to obtain machines that could be used for weapons design. The sale came after Washington had denied Cray Research and Intel Scientific licenses to export supercomputers to Israel because of fears their machines would be used to design nuclear weapons.
Government officials said that companies like Meiko fall in a gray area.
"We have struggled in the Government over the issue of what makes an American company," said Jonathan Streeter, a Commerce Department official who is an expert on supercomputers. "It does open up a real can of worms; this is something we will be hearing about from the Japanese."
Livermore officials said that they were still negotiating the terms of the contract and would review a variety of issues before the contract was formally awarded.
David Schwoegler, a spokesman for the laboratory, said that one of the issues the Energy Department is reviewing is whether Meiko Scientific should be considered American or British. He indicated today, however, that Livermore was confident that the company would meet the domestic-content test.
"Meiko Scientific is a U.S. company," Mr. Schwoegler said. "The Meiko system under consideration is U.S. designed and 85 percent of the hardware is manufactured in the United States."
The president of Meiko Scientific, David Alden, said that the CS-2 supercomputer had been designed in both the United States and Europe.

HEADLINE: O'Rourke Rejects Offer of Judicial Bid

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, March 5

 BODY:
Andrew P. O'Rourke, Westchester's County Executive, today wistfully turned down the offer of a nomination for a Federal judgeship. He will seek re-election to the job he has held for 10 years.
The decision came as something of a surprise since Mr. O'Rourke, a Republican, had been longingly waiting for a seat on the bench ever since President Bush nominated him in November 1991. 
 That nomination was allowed, with maddening suspense, to expire when Democrats in the Senate sensed an impending victory by Bill Clinton. But it was revived this week when Senators Alfonse M. D'Amato and Daniel Patrick Moynihan put Mr. O'Rourke's name forward once more for a vacancy in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
 
Senators Divide Nominations
 Under a system set up in the 1970's, New York's senators have agreed to divide judgeship nominations, with three going to the senator whose party is in power and one going to the member of the other party. So, although the Democrats are now in power, Mr. D'Amato was able to submit Mr. O'Rourke's name again.
Mr. O'Rourke said today that despite Mr. Moynihan's assurances, he was not prepared to see his nomination languish once more in a capital dominated by Democrats.
"There are only 900 Federal judgeships and it's a very elite club," he said at a news conference here. "I could see myself there, but in all honesty I see myself more clearly as a county executive serving the people of the county."
Despite his decision today, his flirtation with the judgeship is already a campaign issue as he battles one of two Democratic contenders -- Andrew J. Spano, the County Clerk who announced his candidacy in January, and Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky of Greenburgh, who has yet to make an official announcement. Some Democratic officials had predicted that Mr. O'Rourke would reveal the new judgeship offer, then turn it down as a ploy to show the people of Westchester that he remains eager to manage their affairs.
"I think Andy's tired of the job," Mr. Spano said earlier this week. "I think he wants out and there has been a natural malaise that has enshrouded government."
 
Tough Battle in November
 Mr. O'Rourke will have a tough battle in November in a county once dominated by Republicans where Democrats have achieved an edge in voter registration of 181,360 to 157,774. There are also 10,515 Conservatives and 119,126 independents.
The 59-year-old Mr. O'Rourke, a centrist Republican, beat Mr. Brodsky four years ago with 52 percent of the vote, drawing support from moderate Democrats as well as Republicans in his onetime political home of Yonkers and in most of the county's towns and villages. His strongest base is among Italian and Irish Catholic voters, but he has drawn Jewish support as well.
Mr. O'Rourke is an avuncular man with elegant silvery hair and considerable charm and wit. He can tell salty tales of a welfare childhood in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen or chuckle over his appearances on the television show "Quiz Kids." His hard-to-ruffle manner has made the running of a county for 875,000 citizens seem easy. He is probably the nation's only county executive to have published two adventure novels while in office.
Mr. O'Rourke maintains that he has been a good fiscal steward. He has not raised taxes since a one-cent increase in the sales tax two years ago. And he claims to have saved taxpayers money by demanding tougher investigations of welfare eligibility and work programs for 600 of the 1,500 people on home relief. He has, he says, cut the number of homeless cases from 4,553 in January 1991 to 3,542 in December 1992, though advocates for the homeless counter that the homeless have been forced to improvise in often-bruising ways.
Mr. Spano, a genial Democrat of 56, has long pined for Mr. O'Rourke's job. He is given high marks for computerizing the clerk's office so that residents seeking mortgage documents will no longer have to leaf through dusty ledgers. He needs to convince voters that he can tackle tougher policy issues, such as housing. To counter any impressions of provincialism, Mr. Spano has exhorted the county to awaken to a global economy and the age of information.
 
Nimble Intellect
 Mr. Brodsky, a blunt, hard-charging, 46-year-old Harvard Law School graduate, is regarded as the most nimble intellect. But his almost exclusive experience as a legislator has raised questions about whether he can manage an intricate administration and whether he has, as Mr. Spano diplomatically puts it, the personal "skills in bringing people together."
"The county government has been corruptly and unintelligently managed," Mr. Brodsky said at his 300-year-old house in Greenburgh. "The net result is skyrocketing taxes, a breakdown of service delivery."
Mr. O'Rourke swats at such mosquitoes. "Brodsky is like a guy sitting on the shore hoping this great ship will go on the rocks so he can claim salvage rights," he said.
Westchester is one of the nation's most affluent counties, with a median household income of $50,872. Despite its reputation as an emblematic suburb, 40 percent of its residents live in four cities -- Yonkers, New Rochelle, Mount Vernon and White Plains. Ethnically, its people just about mirror the nation: 79.4 percent are white, 13.7 percent are black, 9.8 percent are Hispanic and 3.7 percent are Asian.
The county's political arrangement has sometimes left county authorities gasping for identity. Most people think of themselves as living in the county's 19 towns, 23 villages or its small cities, places that collect their garbage, teach their children and protect them against crime. For many people that is about all the government they want or need.
"The county government tends to be remote from people and provides services that people don't understand are provided by the county," said S. J. Schulman, former president of the Westchester County Association, a business group.
Yet the county government spends $1.2 billion of their money and employs 10,000 people. It runs a large network of parks, treats the towns' sewage, operates a world-class medical center and, as an agent of the state, provides welfare and Medicaid payments to its poorest citizens.
Indifference to the county's problems may have permitted Westchester to develop a reputation for patronage, making its politics sometimes seem as feudal as Huey Long's Louisiana.
Leonard N. Spano, the Republican leader of Yonkers and no relation to Andrew Spano, has 18 relatives on the county payroll. Three years ago, the innocence of Playland Amusement Park, a county-run park in Rye, was shattered by a state report that found that Playland's director was a Republican operative who tacitly squeezed $80,000 for the party's coffers from 21 amusement vendors.
Mr. O'Rourke rejects any responsibility for these indiscretions, noting, for example, that many of Mr. Spano's relatives were hired before he became executive in 1983.
 
Problems of Affordability
 Westchester's Aaa bond rating is better than that of Nassau or Suffolk. Still, the county faces serious problems. Its population is aging, and senior citizens, who may own large homes but have reduced incomes, cannot afford the property taxes needed to sustain the county's well-regarded schools and other services.
Young men and women who grew up in Westchester cannot buy or rent homes here. Many towns find that their volunteer firefighters cannot afford to live within their boundaries.
One criticism leveled at Mr. O'Rourke is that he was slow in recognizing his powers to intervene in the housing crisis until a year ago when he proposed a plan to have the county assist villages in building homes for families earning up to $64,000.

HEADLINE: Haitian Refugees Find Welcome Wears Thin

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

 BODY:
When Jean Silien Talabert came to New York last year, his brother eagerly gave him a place to live.
But now his brother says he cannot support him any longer, and the 26-year-old Haitian refugee is staying with a woman he barely knows. He must leave the house daily at 8 A.M and return at 6 P.M. when she does. She does not allow him to bathe at her place, although he does at night when she is asleep. 
 "I don't blame her," Mr. Talabert said matter-of-factly. "If my brother can't help me, she has done enough for me -- and at least I have a place to sleep."
Mr. Talabert, like many of the 1,000 Haitian refugees who ended up in New York after fleeing their violence-torn homeland in 1991, is finding the welcome wearing thin.
 
Late-Night Calls
 Some refugees who were taken in by relatives or other immigrants are being turned out, their hosts unwilling or unable to keep supporting them. Caseworkers at social service agencies that assist refugees say it is not unusual to receive telephone calls in the middle of the night from clients who have been kicked out.
"Now we're dealing with something harder: sponsorship breakdown," said Harold Pirem, a caseworker at Church World Services, an agency in Brooklyn. "My job is to make sure that they have a place to sleep. It's a giant job."
After the ouster of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991, more than 40,000 Haitians risked their lives aboard rickety boats on the high seas fleeing the country. They were picked up by Coast Guard cutters and taken to the Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba. More than 10,000 were found to have some basis for seeking political asylum and were allowed into the United States, where most of their asylum applications are still pending.
 
Asylum Argument
 While Mr. Talabert tries to survive in this country, the Supreme Court is considering whether political asylum seekers like him should be allowed into the country at all. The Government argued this week that it should have the right to pick up Haitians at sea and return them to their country without asylum hearings. An appeals court has upheld the refugees' right to seek haven.
Most Haitian refugees who came to the United States after the coup settled in South Florida, where many are having the same problems as the Haitians in New York.
Reynold Delatour, a supervisor at Catholic Community Services in Miami, said that when the refugees were taken to South Florida from Guantanamo, many declared casual acquaintances as sponsors, people they had known in Haiti, because they feared deportation if no one sponsored them. But many of those relationships have broken down.
"They are bouncing around," Mr. Delatour said. "They eat here and eat there."
About 1,000 Haitians came to New York, in many cases relying on relatives and friends who had been in the United States only a short time themselves and were barely making a living.
For newcomers who had no relatives to help them, private agencies such as Church World Services and Catholic Charities, which receive money from the Federal Government, provide services to the refugees. The agencies try to find sponsors who will provide room and board until the refugees can fend for themselves. The agencies also help refugees find jobs and apply for Medicaid and other benefits.
 
Grants Are at Risk
 But social-service agencies helping the newcomers fear that their Federal grants may be reduced, even as the refugees' needs keep growing. The agencies are currently renegotiating their contracts with the Government.
Last year, the Community Relations Service of the Justice Department, the Federal agency in charge of resettling refugees, had threatened to cut more than 80 percent of the refugee resettlement financing, but that proposal was rescinded after pressure from refugee advocates.
If financing is reduced this year, the advocates say, many refugees will be left on their own and some may end up homeless.
"It's a very stressful situation," said David Ferdinand, a caseworker at Catholic Charities. "You don't know if you're going to have a job from one day to the next, and above all, who will take care of the refugees."
Ron Tomalis, a spokesman for the Community Relations Service, would not comment on the budget while contract negotiations were under way.
Social workers at Catholic Charities in Brooklyn said the agency's budget for resettling 365 Haitian refugees is $238,000 this year, including staff salaries and supplies.
The agencies help the refugees in various ways, including employment, housing and legal counsel. Because many of the refugees speak only Creole and have no relatives in the United States, they often rely on staff members at the center to translate and explain documents.
"We don't know what we'll do, because without this center there will be no hope and we will have to sleep in the subways," said Paulanne Paul, who at 20 is the matriarch in charge of three teen-age cousins and a younger brother.
Some refugees have been more fortunate. Evina Jean Louis, 42, said she had been able to depend on relatives.
On the day she went to apply for Medicaid, her cousin drove from New Jersey and took her to the Church World Services office to make sure she was safe. "I have been treated nicely by my family," she said. "They trust me inside their home."
Unemployed, she said that her relatives often collect donations for her, which she sends to her husband and three children, who are still in Haiti.
But others have not been so lucky. Mr. Pirem's small office at Church World Services in Flatbush, Brooklyn, is crowded with stacks of folders, and the phone rings incessantly. On one recent day, Mr. Pirem was so busy that he picked up the phone from the fax machine and talked with two clients simultaneously.
As soon as he hung up, he had five refugees and three other visitors to accommodate. In all, he is responsible for 250 refugees in Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island. Another Church World Services office in Manhattan deals with refugees living there and in the Bronx and Westchester.
One refugee, Herold Abraham, 26, who was wearing a light jacket on a frigid day, asked Mr. Pirem for a coat.
Since arriving eight months ago, he has quickly learned many American ways. His hair is cut in a fade, a hairstyle rare in his native Cap-Haitien. He has a "J" carved into his hair, and when asked why, he answers: "It means I have no problems."
But he does. He called a reporter aside and peppered him with questions.
"When do you think Aristide will return?"
"Do you think they will force us back to Haiti?" He paused.
"You know, I want to stay here," he said.
Mr. Abraham said he would like to go to school, make a decent living and support his family.
"I don't want to sell drugs or something like that," he said. "I have two children in Haiti and I want to take care of them."
Mr. Abraham and many other refugees, dreading the possibility that they might be returned to Haiti, are especially concerned about their legal status. Fewer than 1 percent of the 10,000 refugees admitted after the 1991 coup have been granted asylum.
Many of the refugees tell chilling tales of escape from soldiers who came looking for them. Mr. Talabert said that his sister Marie Nicole and brother Jean Destin were killed when armed soldiers came to his home. He said he never returned home and went into hiding until he found a boat leaving for the United States.
"The only reason that I am alive is because I was not home," Mr. Talabert said. "I would have been dead like the others."

She fears that Catholic Charities in Brooklyn may not receive enough money to continue to help the refugees. She stood outside the center with other Haitians. (Edward Keating/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: More Borrowing in January

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
After spending heavily at Christmas, Americans took out their credit cards again in January, increasing their borrowing for the fifth straight month, the Government reported yesterday.
Consumer installment credit outstanding rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.5 percent, to $727.6 billion, the Federal Reserve said. That followed a 5.3 percent increase in December, the largest jump in two years. The December increase had previously been estimated at 4.1 percent. 
 The last decline in consumer borrowing came in August, which marked the seventh consecutive drop. The new level of credit outstanding is the largest since February 1992.
Economists expect consumers to continue to increase their spending this year, although perhaps at a somewhat slower pace than at the end of 1992.
Preliminary indications are that consumer spending faded a bit in February. Big retail chains said this week that bad weather in some parts of the country had depressed sales somewhat.
In January, revolving credit -- which includes credit cards -- soared at an annual rate of 9.4 percent, to $253.2 billion. That offset declines in auto loans and other kinds of consumer borrowing.
Auto loans fell at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, to $259.6 billion. But that followed an 11 percent increase in December. Other kinds of consumer loans fell at a 2.9 percent rate, to $214.8 billion.
The Fed's consumer credit report includes all household debt not secured by real estate. It does not include home-equity loans or mortgages.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges on Reduction By Germany of Interest Rate

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar surged in heavy trading yesterday, bolstered by a cut in a German interest rate and a large increase in American jobs last month.
Gold prices also advanced worldwide. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $329.80 a troy ounce, up 80 cents from Thursday. The Republic National Bank said gold added 85 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $329.60. 
 The dollar began climbing in European trading after the Bundesbank of Germany cut the money market rate. The move, which took the market by surprise because it came a day after the central bank's policy-making committee met and took no action, could pave the way for further easings.
Lower rates abroad make yields on American securities more attractive, thereby increasing investors' need for dollars.
The dollar was firm when trading shifted to domestic markets. But it began to soar after the Labor Department reported nonfarm payrolls swelled by 365,000 in February, about three times greater than the increase analysts had been expecting and an indication of American economic strength.
 
High for Year Against Mark
 The dollar surged about 3 pfennigs against the German mark to a high for the year and also rose sharply against the Swiss franc.
Its "overall strength spilled over and even allowed it to strengthen against the Japanese yen," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the investment advisory firm IDEA. The dollar has been losing ground steadily against the yen in recent weeks.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 116.47 yen, down 0.51 yen from Thursday's close. Later in London, it rose to 117.75 yen. In New York it settled at 117.60 yen by 4 P.M., up from 116.75 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.4458, from $1.4540 late Thursday. In New York at 4 P.M. it cost $1.4470 to buy one pound, less expensive than Thursday's $1.4560.
Other dollar rates in New York at 4 P.M., compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.6685 German marks, up from 1.6380; 1.5445 Swiss francs, up from 1.5195; 5.6580 French francs, up from 5.5590; 1,578.00 Italian lire, up from 1,563.00, and 1.2466 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2437.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.6685 marks, up from 1.6340; 1.5465 Swiss francs, up from 1.5165.

The surprise drop this week in the minimum rate on United States Savings Bonds to 4 percent from 6 percent caused immediate concern among many Americans who invest in these Federal securities through payroll deduction or direct purchase. Yet even with the lower rate, when the bonds are compared with other guaranteed investments, they remain an attractive option for investors.
The Treasury Department lowered the rate for both Series EE and Series HH bonds, effective last Monday. It said that this action was taken in response to the substantial decline in market rates over the last year or so. 
 "Buying savings bonds used to be a no-brainer as an alternative to cash," said Joel S. Isaacson, a partner in Clarfeld & Company, a New York accounting firm. "And even now, for a conservative investor, they are still not a bad investment."
Mr. Isaacson ticked off some of the advantages of savings bonds: the Government guarantee that principal will be repaid; the deferral of Federal income tax on the interest until a bond is redeemed; the ease of purchase at no cost, and the exemption from state and local income taxes.
The 4 percent minimum means bondholders will get no less, but they could very well get more. Every six months, the Government sets a market-based rate for the bonds equivalent to 85 percent of the average return on marketable five-year Treasuries. If that market-based rate is higher than the minimum, it will be paid to holders of savings bonds, as long as they have owned their bonds for at least five years. This market-based rate is now 5.04 percent.
The average yield for bank money-market accounts is 2.66 percent, while average C.D. yields range from 2.76 percent for three months to 5.25 percent for five years. The rate for a three-month Treasury bill is about 2.9 percent and for a five-year Treasury note around 5 percent.
Investors willing to assume more risk, however, can probably achieve higher returns by putting their money into securities that are not federally guaranteed. "Most people can do better than savings bonds," said Lewis J. Walker, an Atlanta financial planner. "A 4 percent return adjusted for taxes and inflation puts you in a negative position."

HEADLINE: Dispute Over Insurance Imperils a Barnes Show

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
The opening of long-awaited exhibition of French paintings from the Barnes Collection in Merion, Pa., scheduled for early May at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, has been thrown into doubt after a Government lawyer said a Federal agency had acted unlawfully in approving Government insurance for the show.
David Fisher, a lawyer for the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities, notified the 14 council members last week that their approval in private of an application by the National Gallery for $300 million of insurance for the show had violated the Sunshine Act, which requires Federal agencies to conduct their business in public. 
 >The exhibition, called "Great French Paintings From the Barnes Foundation: Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and Early Modern," is scheduled to open May 2.
The council's action has also been criticized because it would offer Government insurance to a mainly domestic exhibition, and the Federal program for insuring art was intended to cover works of art coming from abroad.
 
Challenged in Congress
 The propriety of the council' action was questioned at a Congressional hearing Thursday on the budget for the National Gallery. Representative Sidney Yates, Democrat of Illinois, who conducted the hearing, said the action constituted "a major policy shift" and required further study.
The National Gallery had asked the council to approve Government insurance of the 81 works in the show in transit to Washington and while on view there. Eighty of them would come from the Barnes Collection; one painting would come from Paris.
This would be the first time the Arts and Indemnity Act of 1975, which was intended to facilitate international loans of artworks, would be used to insure a domestic one.
Jerry Martin, the acting chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, who is also a member of the Federal council, said on Wednesday that he had voted with the minority against extending coverage because "it is bad policy to make an exception for the National Gallery which is not available to others."
Another member of the council is J. Carter Brown, the former director of the National Gallery, who applied for coverage of the Barnes show before leaving office in September. Mr. Brown said he had been seeking "to correct an anomaly in the original legislation" in order to "expand one of the most broadly beneficial programs Congress has ever created." He added that the cost of the program to the Government was "virtually nil."
The Government's insurance of the Barnes show would save the National Gallery about $600,000 in insurance costs, Mr. Brown said.
 
A Product of Inflation
 The Indemnity Act was passed by Congress at time when art prices were soaring. As a consequence, insurance became so costly that international loan shows seemed no longer feasible for many institutions. There is no specific language in the act that excludes domestic shows from coverage.
Under the act, the Government buys no insurance, but covers art shows for a maximum of $300 million. Museums must still buy insurance to cover the value in excess of $300 million. The Barnes show is valued at more than $1 billion. Nevertheless, the Indemnity Act has been a boon to American museums in arranging loans from overseas.
Since 1975, about 175 shows have been insured by the Indemnity Act.

Escape From New York?

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
It started when Gov. Mario Cuomo irresponsibly gave Staten Island the go-ahead to pursue secession. Then came similar rumblings from Queens, followed by a borough-based rebellion that toppled the Schools Chancellor. And now the Brooklyn Borough President is campaigning for more local control of government in what is either a power grab or a misguided attempt at reform.
There's a temptation to dismiss this latest wave of New York-bashing as a silly nuisance. In all likelihood, after all, the union will stand. But in what condition? Elected officials are making malicious mischief by encouraging the balkanization of a city that, for all its faults, works. Their threat to sound government distorts reality, ignores history and could do plenty of damage. 
 The Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, hints darkly that without a shift of power to the boroughs the city will secede from itself, and asks for a government commission. Stop secession, he says, by giving boroughs more control over services, development and spending.
Sounds reasonable. But wait. Borough presidents used to control local services more than 30 years ago. They lost that power when evidence of waste, inefficiency and corruption persuaded New Yorkers to strengthen the central government and weaken borough leaders.
Now champions of the boroughs want to return to the old days, arguing that the city government is out of touch, bloated and inefficient. The city bureaucracy clearly does need streamlining and could be more responsive to the public. But history suggests borough control would make matters worse, not better.
And why borough control anyway? It's a fallacy that Brooklyn defines Brooklynites. That romantic notion seems more appropriate to the days of Ebbets Field, and probably wasn't true then either. In today's increasingly diverse city, certainly, people identify themselves more by economic class, race and ethnicity than by geography. The Orthodox Jewish population of Borough Park (Brooklyn) has more in common with the Orthodox Jewish community of Riverdale (the Bronx) than with largely Italian Carroll Gardens (Brooklyn).
Moreover, how would the city ever build essential facilities if, as Mr. Golden suggests, borough halls wielded more control over capital projects? Any city needs jails, homeless shelters, incinerators, sewage plants. The City Council now has final say over siting such facilities. With 51 members from the five boroughs, it manages, however imperfectly, to balance need and fairness. What borough would unilaterally impose a sewage plant on itself?
The perception of lost power underlies the unhappiness of Mr. Golden and some of his colleagues. They pine for the days when they used their one vote on the now-defunct Board of Estimate as leverage. After the Supreme Court found the board's voting system unconstitutional because each borough had only one vote regardless of its population, a City Charter change eliminated the board. Its key powers went to the City Council, where each borough has representation based on population.
Brooklyn actually has more voting power today. Even Staten Island, which complains about having only three Council members, cannot deny a recent state report showing that the borough actually gets more back in city services than it provides in taxes. In fact, all the boroughs retain plenty of power. The Speaker of the Council is Peter Vallone, a Queens homeowner, not a Manhattan elitist; the revised Charter gave each borough president an appointment to the City Planning Commission; each still names a Board of Education member and appoints all community board members; each has a piece of the capital and expense budgets and significantly expanded planning departments.
To go further and create borough-wide fiefs makes no sense, especially since the city is still experimenting with its new form of government. It's been only two years since the Council expanded from 35 to 51 members and took full advantage of its new powers. Clearly that's too soon to judge how it's working, or to reconfigure government yet again.
The idea of secession is even more troubling. It risks a race and class war of dreadful dimensions. First overwhelmingly white Staten Island threatens to leave. Then what -- Howard Beach? Douglaston? Bay Ridge?
Maybe today nobody would invent a city of over seven million people, living in five boroughs that cover 320 square miles. But it has existed since 1898, and a centralized, representative government can take most of the credit. The flawed but awesome experiment that is New York City will always need reinventing. It does not need obliteration.

HEADLINE: Drug Companies Finance Much of Medical Research in the U.S.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Drug Companies' Profits Finance More Promotion Than Research" (front page, Feb. 21): As a clinician and scientist who worked with some dozen and a half pharmaceutical companies as board member, consultant, information source, clinical and basic researcher, I think readers are entitled to an alternate opinion from that presented by a professor of pharmacy administration, professors of pharmaceutical economics and the Food and Drug Administration commissioner. 
 Drug development goes through a series of steps; from phase I, when a product undergoes basic investigation, to phase IIIA, when it is applied to large clinical trials. Once a product enters the phase IIIA, IIIB region, a union between research and development and marketing occurs. In the final stage of drug development, the research and development and marketing departments may contribute funds from both their budgets to carry out clinical studies for approval.
The pharmaceutical industry is criticized for spending on "promotion." What is promotion? It involves sending young scientists and clinicians to national meetings to present research; giving textbooks to residents and medical students; subsidizing publication of national symposiums; funds for resident educational activities for medical schools; scholarship endowment for clinical investigators; subsidy of clinical journal publication, and distribution of drug samples to patients.
Most important, it involves paying for the vast majority of basic and clinical research in United States medical centers. This results in the training of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, clinicians and clinical subspecialists, and the creation of a forum for the pharmaceutical industry to carry out its clinical studies.
This union between industry and the university has resulted in the development of one of the most competitive industries in the world, one that should be nurtured by the public and the Government, rather than restricted.
The pharmaceutical industry and physicians have not created this country's health care problems. Increased drug costs are the result of inflation, product liability litigation and an obstructive Food and Drug Administration. Increasing drug use can be traced to an aging population trying to maintain its health.
We would be well advised to deal with the difficult issues of finding funds for immunization, adequate prenatal care and wellness programs, rather than deluding ourselves that the pharmaceutical industry and medical profession are to blame for our health care problems.

 BODY:
THE OVERWORKED AMERICAN: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure, by Juliet B. Schor. (Basic Books, $12.) If your job seems to take up too much time, it's probably not your imagination. The author, an economist, asserts that declines in both living standards and the power of unions have led to increased work hours, as has capitalism itself. "Her book is systematic enough to satisfy the scholar, yet it is witty and engaging for the lay reader," Robert Kuttner said in The Book Review last year.
AT WEDDINGS AND WAKES, by Alice McDermott. (Dell, $5.99.) Three children observe the mysteries and rituals of the adult world while their mother, in the company of her three sisters and her stepmother, learns to cope with marital disappointment and middle age. Last year our reviewer, Verlyn Klinkenborg, praised Alice McDermott as a writer who "has taught us to expect something extraordinary." In this, her third novel, "her sentences have been lengthened and elaborated, without becoming unduly sinuous, without losing their immediacy," he said. "They have a harmony all their own -- grave, decorous, moving." 
 A FULL SERVICE BANK: How BCCI Stole Billions Around the World, by James Ring Adams and Douglas Frantz. (Pocket Books, $10.) What can you say about a bank that had both Manuel Antonio Noriega and the terrorist Abu Nidal as its clients? Basically, that the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, in matters criminal, was as global as its name implied. "What distinguishes 'A Full Service Bank' from so many other books about outrageous scandals is its penetrating treatment of the underlying forces at play," Jeffrey E. Garten said here last year.
WILDERNESS TIPS, by Margaret Atwood. (Bantam, $6.99.) In her latest collection of short stories, Margaret Atwood shows how men and women often make fictions of their pasts in order to live more comfortably in the present. In 1991 our reviewer, James Wilcox, found the best of these 10 pieces "complex, beguiling stories," fiction that "conjures up a sense of the mysterious in even the most banal relationships."
WHITEOUT: Lost in Aspen, by Ted Conover. (Vintage, $11.) The author had a certain Faustian experience in Aspen, Colo., but still escaped with his soul. Living there first as a cabdriver, then as a reporter and finally as a sybarite, he was able to analyze how the resort town has become the capital of shallow chic. "Mr. Conover has done the near-impossible," Tim Sandlin said here in 1991. "He has created a book about Aspen that is fair and interesting at the same time."
A CASE OF CURIOSITIES, by Allen Kurzweil. (Ballantine, $10.) This novel invites the reader to experience the Enlightenment through one of its more humble geniuses, a watchmaker whose obsession with invention parallels the writer's own. Last year our reviewer, Malcolm Bradbury, found this a "brilliantly bookish book" that is also filled with "considerable wit."
THE EDWARDIAN TURN OF MIND, by Samuel Hynes. (Pimlico/Trafalgar Square, $22.95.) Britain's twilight of empire was a time of great social change, when the country was caught between the rigidity of the Victorian period and the progressiveness of emerging modernism. "There will be many more studies of the age," Michael Holroyd said in The Book Review in 1969. "But few of them are likely to be so well constructed and compulsively readable." Also out in paperback is Mr. Hynes's examination of the Edwardian period's aftermath, A WAR IMAGINED: The First World War and English Culture (Collier/Macmillan, $15), where he analyzes the war's effects on authors and artists. "He himself unravels the postwar dilemmas: how to interpret the war, whom to blame, where next to go," said our reviewer, Peter Vansittart, in 1991.
SARAH CANARY, by Karen Joy Fowler. (Zebra, $5.99.) The Pacific Northwest in the 1870's is the setting for a strange visitation by an apparent madwoman who irrevocably alters the fortunes of a Chinese immigrant and several other characters. "This is an extraordinarily strong first novel, the product of an unusually fertile imagination," Barbara Quick said here in 1991.
THE TRIUMPH OF PIERROT: The Commedia del l'Arte and the Modern Imagination, by Martin Green and John Swan. (Pennsylvania State University, $16.95.) The authors show that the informal, unscripted "low comedy" of the commedia dell'arte had wide-ranging influences on modern creative minds, from Charlie Chaplin to Samuel Beckett. While our reviewer, Walter Kendrick, found some of the book's conclusions too broad, it "may point the way toward rewriting the history of 20th-century art," he said in 1986.
SUGAR CAGE, by Connie May Fowler. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $10.) Mysticism and romance entwine the lives of several Florida families, white and black, from 1945 to the 1960's. Different characters take turns narrating this first novel, into which "Ms. Fowler has inventively worked the notion of 'sweet poison,' " Roy Hoffman said here last year.
HE, SHE AND IT, by Marge Piercy. (Fawcett Crest, $5.99.) Isaac Bashevis Singer meets "Terminator 2." In this novel, Marge Piercy draws parallels between the creation of a guardian golem for a Jewish ghetto in the 16th century and the invention of a powerful, protective cyborg in 2059. Although our reviewer, Malcolm Bosse, found the book flawed, it is "ambitious" and "confronts large issues," he said in 1991.

Dog's Breakfast

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
Grown dogs don't eat breakfast. Oh, I give my Bernese Mountain dogs, James and Heidi, a hard cookie apiece to shut up their racket in the morning, but they know that one session a day wolfing down their kibble is their lot, which is called their "meal."
That is why I wondered at this figure of speech in a report by Michael Wines in The New York Times during last fall's campaign: "Aides repackaged a dog's breakfast of White House trade and fiscal policies into an 'agenda for American renewal.' " 
 "How did a repast not usually associated with our canine companions," asked Thomas Zekov of New York, "come to represent a repackaging of old ideas into a new program?" Added Mary Lou O'Brien of Brooklyn: "A dog's breakfast? I love it. Where does it come from?"
Since it came from Mike Wines down the hall, I asked him for an explanatory memo. He wrote: "A dog's breakfast is any kind of smorgasbord prepared, in haste or at random, from life's castoffs. In this case, it was the chicken bones and half-eaten pizzas of policies that the Administration had proposed earlier and Congress had rejected. . . . Cat people wouldn't understand, but anyone who has ever walked a dog down an alley would."
A Scottish terrier would say the phrase has a long pedigree. The slang lexicographer Eric Partridge cited Glasgow circa 1934 as its place and time of origin, though he noted that Australians also used the phrase with the same meaning as "confusion, mess, turmoil." (After a three-dog night, one so cold it required three dogs to keep you warm, a dog's breakfast could be quite a mess.)
About the same time, a dog's dinner appeared with a quite different sense. "Why have you got those roses in your hair?" asked a character in "Touch Wood," a 1934 novel by C. L. Anthony. "You look like the dog's dinner." This expression was defined by the Oxford English Dictionary Supplement as "dressed or arranged in an ostentatiously smart or flashy manner," probably derived from the 1871 usage "to put on the dog."
The early 30's, a time for many canine coinages, also saw the expression dog's bait appear in the Ozarks, with a meaning of "too much to eat," as in "Enough's enough, but too much is a dawg's bait."
While we're going to the dogs, here's a query from Alan Geller of Elmwood Park, N.J., who attached an article in The New York Times by John Darnton, writing from Sinj, Croatia: "Another town official . . . brought out a dog-eared diary."
Many a dog's ears do not stand up straight, but lap over. (Heidi, when especially alert to the prospect of leftovers from what she must call a master's breakfast, seems to perk up her ears, but they still lap over; German shepherds' ears are different.) The two words were first used together as a verb in the mid-17th century in a book of essays by Francis Osborne: "To ruffle, dogs-ear, and contaminate by base Language and spurious censures the choicest leaves."
When you turn down the corner of a page in a book, you dog's-ear it. "Lady Slattern Lounger," wrote Richard Brinsley Sheridan in his play "The Rivals" in 1775, ". . . had so soiled and dogs'-eared it, it wa'n't fit for a Christian to read." Thus, a book that has had many pages turned down is dog's-eared, or as it is more frequently written, dog-eared.
We have strayed. What alternatives are there to a dog's breakfast for the writer who wants to describe a mixed bag?
Farrago is a favorite of mine, a 1632 noun rooted in the Latin for "mixed fodder." Mishmash also does the hodgepodgian trick: it's a reduplication of the German mischen, "to mix," which some say was introduced into English via Yiddish (while others hold it was a reduplication of the English mash, but if that's true, how come it's pronounced mish-mosh?). The aforementioned hodge podge, also known as hotchpotch, comes from the French hocher, "to shake," and pot (similar to olio, from the Spanish olla podrida, "rotten pot"). Another term formed of rhyming syllables is ragbag, while another French-based word for "jumble, tangle, muddle" is gallimaufry, "hash."
Taken together, this synonymy amounts to a dog's breakfast.
 
FAT CHAUNCE
 TO GO DOGGIN', according to "Trash Cash, Fizzbos and Flatliners" by Sid Lerner and Gary S. Belkin, is teen-age slang for "to cheat on a partner." Thus the term derogates the fidelity of dogs, who can be more faithul than teen-age hookups.
A hookup, according to Washingtonian magazine, is no longer a radio network; now it means "a person with whom one is romantically involved." In its quick look at college slang, the magazine defines alter nateen as "teen-ager deeply into the counterculture," the verb chaunce as "to leave someone hanging," sick as "cool," nectar as "very cool" and wizard as "exceptionally sick."
Time for the Lexicographic Irregulars, Campus Division, to weigh in with reports on campus slang, the fastest-changing language in Babel's tower. If your prof is crunchy, don't feel schwag: send your local lexicon to Safire's Buzz-kill, The New York Times, 1627 Eye Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006.
 
N.M.I.
 THE CLASSIC CASE OF the Law of Unintended Consequences was the decision by the War Department in the early 1940's to require all personnel without middle names or initials to declare that inadequacy on documents. A corporal named Joe Sadsack would become Cpl. Joe N.M.I. Sadsack, the initials standing for "No Middle Initial" -- thereby defeating the intent of Joe's parents to avoid the letters between given name and surname.
We have come full circle: middle initials are regaining popularity, and whole middle names are in fashion, especially among women. A generation ago, some militant feminists refused to adopt the surname of their husbands; in time, a compromise was found in the use of both names, like Josephine Jones Sadsack, sometimes hyphenated in the British style, Josephine Jones-Sadsack.
Recently, the preference expressed by the First Lady to include her maiden name in her identification pushed this usage to the fore. Hillary Rodham Clinton is the name accepted by most publications on first reference, with "Mrs. Clinton" (rather than "Ms. Rodham Clinton") on subsequent references.
This is a good idea. A name is intended to supply information about a person, and the more background a name offers, the better. Names of males used to add "son" or, in Hebrew and Arabic, be preceded by "ben"; it helped put a person in the context of a family.
For example, as Louis Jay Herman of New York notes, the current fashion, if applied a few generations ago, would have asserted the relationships of a Presidential family: "If Eleanor Roosevelt were alive today, she would be known as Eleanor Roosevelt Roosevelt." (To be painstakingly accurate, her maiden name was Anna Eleanor Roosevelt; her married name was Anna Eleanor Roosevelt Roosevelt.)

HEADLINE: FILM VIEW;
Some Holes Don't Come From Bullets

BYLINE: By Caryn James

 BODY:
Michael Douglas's life in "Falling Down" is a critical mass of all-American problems. Divorced, unemployed, caught in traffic on a sweltering morning, he walks away from his car to face gang violence, vagrants begging for money, bad service at a fast-food joint.
These things could happen to any of us. But would any of us respond by: beating a Korean grocer, shooting a Latino street gang, stabbing a neo-Nazi, terrorizing a Whammyburger restaurant and using a rocket launcher to blow up a construction site? Even if we were having a really, really bad day? 
 There are movies that honestly hit a raw nerve and others that cynically push your buttons, and "Falling Down" is a push-your-buttons film. It may also be the last big Bush-era movie, custom-made for the rabidly conservative Rush Limbaugh crowd that sees social blight as proof that America is lost in a liberal wilderness.
The film catalogues urban disasters and goes out of its way to manufacture "controversy," yet it falls apart on the basic level of common sense. The Douglas character is depicted as both an ordinary Joe and Travis Bickle from "Taxi Driver." That idea is illogical -- you either have it in you to be Travis Bickle or you don't -- but it sells. Hollywood may have voted for Bill Clinton, but "Falling Down" masterfully exploits conservative sentiments.
With his ragged crew cut, short-sleeved white shirt plus pocket protector, and a license plate that reads "D-FENS," Mr. Douglas's character is not part of any cultural elite. The tough-minded performance encourages sympathy yet never asks viewers to like him. Joel Schumacher's vivid direction depicts the harsh reality of urban Los Angeles while letting the film slip into black humor with ease. It's too bad this savvy direction and acting bolster Ebbe Roe Smith's disingenuous script, which evades the fundamental question: Was the main character always crazy, or did society make him snap?
The anonymous D-FENS character starts out as a surrogate for the frustrated working and middle classes. When the Korean grocer mispronounces "five" as "figh," D-FENS shouts, "They don't have v's in China?" He expresses what a segment of the audience might guiltily think but wouldn't dare say. Soon he is threatening the shopkeeper with a baseball bat. The film doesn't ask viewers to condone his behavior, but it assumes they will sympathize with its source.
The character's response to crime and unemployment implies: "Don't blame me. I'm the victim." There is an audience for this opinion, which is the attitude Rush Limbaugh promotes on his radio show and in his best seller, "The Way Things Ought to Be." Just as Mr. Limbaugh's book suggests that the homeless bear some blame for their condition ("I hadn't done anything to cause his homelessness," he complains of a man living in a shelter), so D-FENS rails against a vagrant and snarls at him to get a job.
Like Mr. Limbaugh, the film is smart enough to use satire instead of logic to make political points. A man who asks D-FENS for money says, "I haven't eaten for days," though he happens to be holding a sandwich. When D-FENS shoots up the Whammyburger, he has reason to be annoyed; he wants breakfast and is three minutes too late.
If "Falling Down" were content to be an absurdist black comedy, this sleight-of-mind would make sense. But the film also pretends to be seriously provocative. When a neo-Nazi (played by Frederic Forrest) appears, the story takes a turn that leads to utter nonsense.
The deranged neo-Nazi has an arsenal behind his military-surplus store and sees D-FENS as a kindred spirit. "We are not the same," D-FENS says. "I'm an American. You're a sick . . . " Then he puts on a brown shirt and comes a step closer to becoming the neo-Nazi.
It turns out that D-FENS was probably one sick puppy long before any Whammyburger workers got on his nerves. His ex-wife has been so worried about his violent temper that she has gotten a restraining order against him. Home videos show him bullying his wife and daughter years before the pressures of urban life supposedly made him crack.
Yet the film depicts him as if he were some socially relevant missing link between the audience and the neo-Nazi. This is a master stroke of movie manipulation. Conservative viewers can identify with D-FENS as long as it is cathartic to do so; liberals can debate whether he is the cause or the symptom of social problems; and when he turns into a madman, the entire audience can distance itself. To wonder whether we are like D-Fens is simply to fall for a question as contrived as a high-school debate issue.
The film's duplicity is evident in smaller touches as well. The Douglas character is listed in the credits as "D-FENS." But the police learn his name, Bill Foster, and use it when questioning his mother. She is called Mrs. Foster; the credits coyly list her as "D-FENS's mother."
Even Charles Bronson's exploitative "Death Wish" movies are more honest. That series may be vile in its admiration for the vigilante Mr. Bronson plays, but at least it has the courage of its vileness. "Falling Down" wants its madman to be Everymadman, too. "I'm the bad guy?" he asks at the end, sincerely baffled (though no more than the audience). By then viewers might feel as jerked around by the movie as poor Bill Foster is by urban America.

Thank God that "elephants are sexy" (as indicated in Ray Bonner's article "Crying Wolf Over Elephants," Feb. 7). 
 If elephants didn't have popular appeal, they would have to fall in line with the current political and economic principle of "sustainable utilization." Forgive us mere animal-loving types if we are not adept at sympathizing with sophisticated concepts like that.

HEADLINE: Going to School in Harlem -- To Live

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THE gem of housing redevelopment in Central Harlem has gone on the market on St. Nicholas Avenue, bringing adults back to an elementary school transformed.
The school is the former P.S. 157, between 126th and 127th Streets. It served for more than 70 years and closed in 1975, gradually deteriorating thereafter amid failed attempts at redevelopment. But Elzee Construction of Flatbush took it in hand four years ago and has rebuilt it as rental apartments to standards befitting its status on the National Register of Historic Places. 
 Now its 73 units, with soaring arched windows and ceiling heights of 15 feet, are renting for $550 to $950 a month, or less for the handful of units reserved for low-income tenants. "The building is like an oasis, taking up the whole block," said Robert Molock, a salesman at Bloomingdale's who rented a one-bedroom on the fourth floor for $675 a month.
If P.S. 157 is an oasis, it is also one more example of housing production in Harlem, where rehabilitations of formerly vacant city-owned buildings into housing have been strong since the middle 80's. The money has come primarily from New York City itself.
The city has poured $600 million into gut rehabilitations and some new construction in East, West and Central Harlem over the last six years, according to Department of Housing Preservation and Development figures. Supplemented by about $200 million from private investment and state and Federal governments, the money has produced 10,200 units of new housing.
Harlem and the South Bronx have been the principal recipients of funds for housing under the 10-year, $5 billion housing program set in motion by former Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1986 and continued by Mayor David N. Dinkins. So far, $3 billion has been spent citywide. Although new buildings are involved, especially in the small-homes phase of the program, most of the new units are in gut rehabilitations of vacant buildings that were once in city ownership through tax foreclosure. Other rehabilitations are in former public buildings.
Central Harlem is the broad area north of Central Park to 155th Street, stretching from Fifth Avenue to Morningside Avenue. It had a generous share of tax-foreclosed properties, so a heavy investment in getting buildings back to productive use is hardly surprising.
In the Central Harlem area roughly $486 million has been spent for housing development or renewal. This has produced 6,660 units in the rental or homeownership form, for a spectrum of income levels. Part of the production has been new market-rate condominiums. Some are still on the market at prices between $85,000 and $235,000. There are also low-income rentals, low- to moderate-income rentals, moderate- to middle-income rentals, and mixed-income condominiums.
In all, a complex and diverse housing production program, carried on in the face of a drastic decline in the 80's in Federal housing programs that directly subsidize -- at a cost in New York City of about $8,000 a family per year in a long-term mortgage -- new housing construction for low-income people.
THE P.S. 157 reconstruction, the fulfilment of 12 years of development effort, is individually noteworthy among the about 600 properties touched by the renewal program in Harlem, and not for its architectural and historic characteristics alone. It is the first school in New York City to be converted to residential use with help from both the Federal tax credits for low-income housing and the tax credit for restoration of a historic property. Together they made it possible to raise $1.3 million in private equity for the development.
Its cornucopia of public and private financings also shows the scope of financing tools that must be used to get new housing priced in New York City at a level affordable to the market in which it is rented or sold.
The P.S. 157 project uses a $2.2 million housing development action grant from the Federal Government; a $2.8 million loan at 1 percent interest from New York City; an additional 1 percent loan of $896,000 from the city for asbestos removal alone and a $964,000 construction loan from the Community Preservation Corporation, the bank consortium that lends citywide for multifamily housing reconstruction in moderate-income neighborhoods.
It all adds up to $8.1 million for 73 apartments, or $111,000 an apartment.
That is about $50,000 an apartment more than the typical gut renovation, and the product is not coincidentally something special. Yet it might never have come about if Phillip Morrow didn't live in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn.
Mr. Morrow is the director of development of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation, the state-financed subsidiary of the Urban Development Corporation that is closely involved in planning and development activity in Harlem. In some instances H.U.D.C. has itself been the developer of new housing.
In the middle 80's Mr. Morrow watched as two private developers tried and failed to raise the private financing needed to get the P.S. 157 project started. Even with the action grant and city-financed asbestos removal there was construction risk that lenders were not ready to bear.
In the late 80's, from his home on Cambridge Place, Mr. Morrow also watched admiringly as the city-financed gut rehabilitation of the old Mohawk Hotel into 84 apartments proceeded on Washington Avenue. Who was doing that excellent historic restoration, he wondered.
It turned out to be Leo Zisman,a contractor who runs Elzee Construction Inc., on Coney Island Avenue. Mr. Zisman came into the picture at P.S. 157 in 1988 when the project was about to lose its action grant for want of a developer capable of bringing in the private financing required.
Mr. Zisman had that capability, and also the capacity to execute the preservation-oriented architectural design from the firms of John Ellis & Associates and Hirsch/Danois Architects, both of Manhattan.
BOTH inside and out the reconstruction has respected features of the old school, which was built in the final years of the 19th century to a design by Charles B.J. Snyder, the city's school superintendent at the time. He designed more than 100 elementary and high schools, including Erasmus Hall High in Brooklyn, Morris High in the Bronx and Flushing High in Queens.
The New York Landmarks Conservancy, the private nonprofit organization that works to preserve distinguished properties in the city, described P.S. 157 in its submission to the Secretary of the Interior supporting its inclusion on the National Register as "a transitional and vernacular reworking of Chateauesque motifs with those of the slightly later Classical Revival."
Respectful to all things Chateauesque the building remains. Most of the 385 windows, 10 feet tall and weighing 80 pounds each, were removed window by window and taken to Norbert Morris, who runs the Morris Window Company in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. At $1,000 a window he restored the frames with a hand tool and replaced the old glass with thermally insulated glass. Special weights were installed so that residents would be able to lift the windows from the bottom.
Some windows had to be built new because they were excessively deteriorated or missing entirely. Jay Winston at Englander Millwork in the Belmont section of the Bronx did the construction, replicating the old windows -- and the old entrance and vestibule doors as well.
Then there was the copper cornice. S.&J. Tinsmith in the Bronx knew exactly how to replicate a missing 10-foot section. And Eddie Rubenchik, a Russian-born carpenter in Brooklyn, restored the large decoraive panels that adorn the walls near the elevators on the upper floors.
"He has hands of gold but I couldn't afford him so I used him only for the historic things," said Mr. Zisman.
From the roof and the edge of the roof 200-pound stones were delivered to Sal and Phil Stagliano at Utica Cast Stone Company in East Flatbush. They made casts for 65 new stones to replace others that were missing or damaged. The replacements are indistinguishable from the originals, says Mr. Ellis, the architect. At one point after the new stones were in place he trained his binoculars on a row of stones on the arches above the cornice and proclaimed the color of one stone unacceptable.
The contractor was sufficiently amused to recount the tale last week. The offending stone was an original.
Some of the most interesting aspects of the restoration are inside the building, where only the tenants will be able to appreciate them. The halls resemble classroom halls, though they are more warmly lit. Doors have been built at regular intervals even when there are no apartments behind them, the better to retain the look of a schoolhouse. Ornamental wrought-iron safety screens run along the fire stairs, and wood wainscotting lines the public halls.
"The double arched windows in the central part of the living room were the selling point for me," said one new tenant, Nancy Haseley, a 34-year-old landscape architect who moved out of a studio apartment in the Chelsea section of Manhattan into a $675-a-month one-bedroom a week ago. She was also struck by the speed of her commute to a job at 40th Street and the Avenue of the Americas. The D and A trains stop outside the door of P.S. 157. The D gets her to work in 14 minutes.
The development is about half rented. The income mix is 20 percent low income and 80 percent market rate, usually people in the $25,000-to-$35,000 income bracket.
DATA prepared by the Harlem Urban Development Corporation indicate that the average income of the general population in Central Harlem is rising. The 1980 census showed there were only 2,000 households in Central Harlem with incomes over $40,000 a year. The 1990 figures (unadjusted for inflation) show there were 16,900 households with incomes over that figure.
New arrivals to the condominium and higher-price rental housing are a key reason for this. The Harlem corporation alone developed 140 condominiums on three major sites and various scatttered brownstones in the 80's. There were also 2,000 new apartments under the Vacant Building Program, financed by the city and Community Preservation Corporation, for middle-income renters, with 1,500 more in construction.
The Harlem Development Corporation is now trying to market 21 condominiums, some of them with 1,600 square feet and the finishes associated with luxury housing, at prices of $110 to $150 a square foot.
"We are not sure they will all be sold," said Mr. Morrow, "but the true test is in front of us. The market seems to be pretty strong for large units."
As a middle-income rental, the P.S. 157 project is itself something of a test. It passed that test for Dr. Olivia Stokes, a consultant in education and family relations who is retired from the faculty of Lehman College of the City University of New York.
Dr. Stokes attended P.S. 89 in Harlem, as well as Junior High 119 and P.S. 136, before going on to Hunter College, City College and N.Y.U. Now she is back in P.S. 157, in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, in a move from a Mitchell-Lama co-op in the Bronx.
"The beauty of the building brought me here," she said.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Marketing Americas Tower;
A Silver Lining Behind the Cloud of Legal Troubles

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
NO one could conceivably call Americas Tower's ordeal a blessing.
The 50-story building, originally scheduled to open in late 1989, instead spent all of 1990 perched forlornly on 44th Street and Avenue of the Americas, half-built and naked to the elements, bankrupt. Its Japanese and American owners, embroiled in legal battles, halted construction indefinitely. 
 By the time construction resumed in February 1991, the real estate market had crashed. Conceived during a space scarcity, Americas Tower went on the market just in time for a glut.
But amidst all that bane was a glimmer of boon. The construction hiatus gave Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese company that assumed full ownership of the building, a chance to do something few developers ever get to do: Make midstream corrections in a building's plans to meet a market's needs.
"We started building in a boom market, and we finished building in a market where we had to offer a lot more," said Nancy C. Nemiroff, director of leasing and marketing for KG A & A Corporation, the Kumagai Gumi subsidiary that owns the building. "We had the chance to build in those extras."
So what started as a stately, institutional building that expected to draw tenants just by its presence has evolved into a high-tech structure, part state-of-the-art, part customized for individual tenants.
There's a standby power system, ready to go onstream in July, that no one ever thought of the first time around. There's a four-stage filter system cleansing the air. There are telecommunications wiring and hook-ups for cable television. The escalators are emptying out in a different place in the first concourse level, to accommodate the cafeteria that Price Waterhouse, the building's anchor tenant, wants to have there. And there will be a revolving video camera on the building's spire, to be used by NHK Japan Broadcasting Company, which will soon move in.
The building, which held its formal opening reception on April 30, is already 65 percent rented.
KG A & A is open for business on its 15th floor. Peterson Consulting moved into 14,000 square feet on the 36th floor last month. The National Sculpture Society occupied 4,000 feet next to KG A & A last week, and American International Group is moving into more than 40,000 feet tomorrow. Workmen are buzzing all over the building preparing for such tenants as Bank Hapoalim and NHK/-MICO to move in within the next few months, and for Price Waterhouse to come in July.
Chances are excellent that many of the tower's most enthusiastic new tenants would have been far less interested in the building as originally conceived.
"You look around town, there aren't that many tower floors in buildings with good ventilation and these kinds of power systems," said David E. Yurkerwich, Peterson's executive vice president.
James J. Schiro, Price Waterhouse's vice chairman for the metropolitan region, echoes a similar theme. "This was one of the few buildings with the kind of space we need that could also accommodate state-of-the-art technology," he said.
Clearly, Americas Tower once thought mortally wounded, has come roaring back from the dead. But the kudos and barrage of renters have cost it dearly. Although no one will talk numbers, tenants allude to very generous workletter allowances, liberal lease terms and rock-bottom rents. And as difficult as getting the building modernized and completed on time may have been, repairing its tarnished reputation was even harder.
There was little question in anyone's mind that, before tenants would even consider the building, questions about its financial stability had to be resolved. In December 1990, right after settling with its original partners, Kumagai Gumi formed KG A&A, whose only raison d'etre was to own and manage Americas Tower with a clean slate.
KG A & A immediately took three steps: It took Americas Tower out of bankruptcy, it hired Cushman & Wakefield to help lease it and it built itself plush offices in the building to use as a showcase for brokers and prospective tenants.
AS the building was being overhauled, so were the marketing tools. KG A & A hired a public relations firm to promote the building. It asked a graphics concern to replace the original promotional material -- big, glossy, and "more than a touch arrogant," Ms. Nemiroff concedes -- with brochures and posters that stress high technology and economy. Separate brochures were printed in Japanese.
KG A & A commissioned a full-scale engineering review of the building, to prove that it was structurally sound despite its bout of abandonment. And it made a video about the building and its high-tech features, which it shows prospective brokers and tenants in its conference room.
"The important thing was, once people were ready to ask questions, we were prepared to show them the answers," Ms. Nemiroff said.
But how to get people interested enough to ask those questions?
Ms. Nemiroff and a five-person team of Cushman & Wakefield agents cold-called brokers across the city, inviting them to take building tours, touting their "flexible commission structure," as Ms. Nemiroff diplomatically phrases it, as well as their willingness to strike good deals.
KG A&A wasn't above staging media events, either. It commissioned Simon Verity, master sculptor at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, to build a one-ton sculpture called the "Gorgeous Mosaic," and publicized it to the fullest. When the sculpture was officially unveiled in April, more than 500 brokers and prospective tenants showed up to see it -- and, not at all coincidentally, were treated to a tour of the building as well. Its purpose served, the sculpture has since been donated to Bellevue Hospital.
"The sculpture attracted great attention to the building, and donating it repositioned the owners as affluent and generous and elegant," Ms. Nemiroff said.
Americas Tower continues to use art as a selling tool. It offered the Sculpture Society a rent below even today's depressed market prices and is building a sculpture gallery as part of the society's offices. The quid pro quo: The society will use the building's 40-foot-high lobby to exhibit sculpture and will lend sculptures to other tenants for display. The first exhibition will be in September.
"OUR dream was always to combine a headquarters and gallery," said Gwen Pier, the Sculpture Society's executive director. "But we could never have afforded the rents in a building like this."
As delighted as KG A&A may be to have the Sculpture Society in house, there is no question which tenant has represented the building's biggest coup: Price Waterhouse, which signed on for 350,000 feet, spread over 15 floors and two concourse levels. The deal, which took only 45 days to negotiate and is rumored to be for about $42 a foot (neither party will talk dollars), gave Americas Tower the air of legitimacy and financial solidity that had stubbornly eluded it till then.
"Any doubts about the building or about the ownership's ability to conclude transactions quickly and smoothly were totally dispelled when we wrapped up a 350,000-square-foot deal in six weeks," said Peter D. Nelson, a Cushman & Wakefield executive director who is helping lease the building.
Apparently, he is right.
Bank Hapoalim, for example, says it was planning to lease 70,000 feet only under one condition: That KG A & A arrange for funds to be available to maintain the building if it again ended up in bankruptcy. Bank Hapoalim was going to insist that these funds remain available until the building was half-leased.
When Price Waterhouse signed on, Bank Hapoalim dropped the requirement, even though the big accounting firm was taking only a third of the building's one million available feet.
"We were no longer worried that the building would wind up empty and we'd get stuck with operating expenses or taxes," said Lawrence Lefkowitz, the Israeli bank's American counsel. "A tenant of that magnitude and stature isn't going to come in without checking everything out first."

Bears Still Circle Edper Bronfman

BYLINE: By Clyde H. Farnsworth

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH the Canadian economy is starting to show the kind of robust activity that in the United States has sent bulls rampaging through Wall Street, bears still inhabit Bay Street's canyons, feeding on the troubles of Canada's biggest conglomerate, the Edper Bronfman empire.
Financial reverses of Edper-controlled companies like Royal Trustco Ltd., a financial services concern, and Bramalea, a big real estate developer, create another multibillion-dollar headache for Canadian banks after writedowns of nearly $2 billion (all figures are in Canadian dollars) from the meltdown last year of the Reichmann family's Olympia & York. 
 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index is some 15 percent below its high of 4,118.94 set on Aug. 13, 1987, with some of that weakness reflecting a 60 percent plunge in the value of the Edper companies over the last three years.
In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average in recent weeks has made repeated new highs and remains within striking range of the latest record -- 3,442.14 -- set Feb. 5. Toronto stocks closed this week at 3,524.49 and the Dow at 3,404.58.
Further downgrading of a wide range of Edper securities by a Canadian bond rating service countered some of the positive impact of tumbling interest rates and a Government report Tuesday that the economy grew by 3.5 percent in last year's fourth quarter.
Also considered a bullish factor was Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Feb. 24 announcement that he would step down next June, opening the way for generational change in the Progressive Conservative Party. Opinion polls found Mr. Mulroney the least popular Canadian leader this century.
"The market felt that had he gone into the next elections, it would have been a drag in terms of Tories getting elected," said Andrew Pyle, senior economist for MMS International, a financial information services firm. But if Mr. Mulroney's departure placates the bulls, the Bronfmans' financial woes are keeping the bears uneasy.
"I think Edper will continue to be a major issue for the banks over the next couple of years," said Alain Tuchmaier, financial services analyst for McLean McCarthy Inc., a Toronto firm owned by Deutsche Bank.
"The value of the investment portfolio that supports debt of the holding companies has fallen precipitously," Mr. Tuchmaier added, noting that one of the reasons that the group of interlocking companies has been unable to get much Bay Street support is its penchant for secrecy, a trait shared with the Reichmann brothers, Paul, Albert and Ralph.
Canada's banks have an estimated $10 billion investment in the Bronfman group in common and preferred shares, bonds, commercial paper, subordinated debt issues and mortgages. The Toronto Dominion Bank, the only institution to make any figures public, placed its Edper preferred share holdings at $509 million. The Bronfmans have raised an additional $5 billion in private placements in the United States. The group has $30 billion in total equity outstanding.
The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which had the most at stake in O & Y, is also believed to be the biggest Edper lender. Its loans to the group were put at $2.35 billion in a recent study by Hugh Brown and Dale Harrison, analysts at Burns Fry Ltd.
Out of an inheritance from the Seagram liquor fortune, the brothers Edward and Peter Bronfman built a complex of 32 public companies and hundreds of private ones, which once accounted for 10 percent of the valuations on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Now the figure is probably closer to 4 percent. They named the complex after a contraction of their first names. Although they are first cousins of Edgar and Charles Bronfman who run Seagram in Montreal, they have no business relations with the diversified liquor giant.
Two of the jewels in the Edper crown -- controlling stakes in John Labatt Ltd., Canada's second largest brewery after Molson Breweries, and MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., the leading forest products company -- were sold last month to raise nearly $2 billion. In a smaller, less publicized deal announced last Monday, the Edper group unloaded a 20 percent block in Astral Communications Inc., a Montreal-based entertainment company.
There are other jewels -- the London Life Insurance Company and the Noranda mining giant, both of which have strapping balance sheets -- and no one expects an O.& Y.-style implosion. One of the key differences is that all of O.& Y.'s assets were pledged, while Edper can still monetize investments to satisfy creditors. Another is that the Reichmanns relied exclusively on borrowed capital, as opposed to equity.
Still, the authorities have expressed concern. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, a federal agency comparable to the Securities and Exchange Commission, has asked all Canadian companies to provide detailed information about their financial relations with the group.
"I have to know what the hell is going on," Superintendent Michael Mackenzie told The Toronto Star. Finance Minister Don Mazankowski and Bank of Canada Governor John Crow are also monitoring the situation.
Analysts say that Edper needs both to simplify its structure and shed parts of troubled units such as Royal Trustco. Within the group, executives voice optimism. Trevor Eyton, chairman of Brascan, one of the main Edper holding companies, told reporters this week that as the economy improves so will Edper's fortunes.

Becoming Washington's Policy Wonk on Technology

BYLINE: By John Markoff

 BODY:
John Sculley's personal odyssey is continuing. The former president of Pepsico was once sarcastically asked by Steven P. Jobs whether he wanted to spend his life as a sugar water salesman. Since then he has made the transition to Apple Computer's chief technology officer and now is on the brink of becoming what President Clinton affectionately referred to as a Washington technology policy wonk.
Mr. Sculley was prominently seated next to Hillary Rodham Clinton when the President presented his economic package before Congress last month. A week later, when President Clinton and Vice President Gore visited Silicon Valley to introduce the President's high technology program, they dined as Mr. Sculley's guests in Los Gatos, Calif. 
 Mr. Sculley had even been prominently mentioned as a candidate for a high-ranking position in the Clinton Administration. Then there is the possibility of the presidency at I.B.M. Mr. Sculley is reported to be one of a small group of executives the world's largest computer maker is considering.
Mr. Sculley asserts that none of these options holds any interest for him. Instead, his passion remains what he describes as the convergence of four industries -- computing, publishing, telecommunications and entertainment -- into a single trillion dollar information business by the turn of the century.
Question: What has meant the most to you at Apple?
Answer: The Powerbook gave us a chance to rethink the entire company. The things that made us successful in the 1980's will not make us successful in the 1990's. I realized that the 90's were going to be designed around communications more than computing. The success of the Powerbook speaks more about what Apple will be like in the future. The Apple of the 1990's is going to be about mobility and communications.
Q: What do you want to accomplish next?
A: I've been at Apple 10 years. The thing that I'm most proud of and most interested in is our technology. That's what I want to focus my time on. If you look at the most successful high technology companies, the best strategies are based on business decisions which are technology centered. My sense is that is the place where I can have the most leverage.
Q: Apple is about to enter the computer systems business. How can you succeed?
A: We don't start with anything near the credibility that other companies have. Instead we'll start with Apple's loyal base in education and other places where we have strength, such as the publishing industry. We're going to focus on what's happening with media being distributed over networks and what's happening with imaging being distributed over networks.
Q: But you're known as an ease-of-use company. Why should Apple succeed in corporate computing?
A: We think one of Apple's strengths is not just its user interface, but its integration of the pieces. Those are things we'll focus on in the server market. But to say we're going to be a heavy-duty server company like H-P or DEC or I.B.M. would go beyond the point of credibility at this point.
Q: How did you begin working with the Clinton Administration?
A: I met Hillary Clinton five years ago when we began working together to create the National Center for Education and the Economy which I now chair and she is a board member of. I met Bill Clinton two years ago when I approached the National Governors' Association on technology and education issues. We couldn't get the Bush Administration to pay any attention to what we were trying to do.

Where Low Is High: the Long Bond

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Interest rates on 30-year Treasury bonds are very low. Or they are high. It all depends on whether you look at absolute levels or at relative rates.
Last week the yield on 30-year bonds fell to 6.68 percent, before surprisingly strong employment figures pushed it back to 6.75 percent. A year ago, the figure was 8 percent. 
 Nonetheless, "the 30-year bond has actually underperformed the bond market rally," noted Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at C. J. Lawrence. Over the same stretch the 10-year Treasury bond yield has fallen from about 7.7 percent to 5.87 percent.
That outperformance may result from a surge of investors away from mortgage-backed securities -- many of which are being repaid as homeowners refinance -- and into 10-year Treasuries, Mr. Yardeni said.
The yield spread between the two bonds rose to levels on Thursday that had not been seen since last fall. That peak came just before a brief plunge in bond prices, in which the rate on 30-year bonds rose from 7.31 percent to 7.76 percent.

The New Allure of the Long Term

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
INVESTORS finally have more money in bond and income funds than in money market funds as falling interest rates pushed yield-seekers into longer-term instruments. The switch has big implications.
First, it brings more stability to the financial structure of corporations and governments by increasing the pool of long-term capital available to them, said Jeffrey M. Schaefer, research director for the Securities Industry Association, in New York. 
 But individual investors are much more vulnerable to changes in interest rates: The longer the term of the issue, the more violent the swing in prices when rates shift.
Investors may need to learn to live with the extra risk, at least if Mr. Schaefer is right in believing that the move into longer-term bonds is a fundamental change in the market.

THE ECONOMY
 
Here's a Statistic That Matters: People Are Going Back to Work 

"Terrific news," one economist said. "It's beginning to look like a more or less normal recovery." The abnormality has been that for all the solid statistics, too many people had no jobs. And last week's "terrific news": 365,000 people started getting paychecks in February, the biggest rise in four years, as the unemployment rate kept inching down, to 7 percent. But did the politicians pause and enjoy these tidings, lean back just for a moment and smile at the thought of families with money in the bank again? Of course not. They're politicians. Debate quickly flared over President Clinton's proposed economic stimulus. Choosing his Presidential adjectives with care, Bob Dole called the report "just another reason why we shouldn't threaten the ongoing Bush recovery by adding $16 billion in so-called stimulus spending to the deficit." But Mr. Clinton said, "We are still about three million jobs behind where we would ordinarily be in a recovery" and vowed to press ahead. Those still out of work also got some relief when the Senate voted to extend jobless benefits.
 
Hunger Amid the Plenty
 
So this is what passes for recovery in this absurdly rich country: More than 10 percent of all Americans -- that's 26.6 million men, women and children -- now turn to food stamps to help get enough to eat. That is a higher percentage than at any time since the program began in 1964. Just one more bit of evidence that as the economic numbers fill up, many a child's dinner plate does not.
 
Forecast: Slow Growth
 
The economy seems to be on a tightrope, inching firmly ahead. Economists see little chance of either fast expansion or recession, instead expecting modest, steady growth. And as if on cue, last week's numbers reinforced this outlook: manufacturing expanded a bit more slowly, construction spending slipped a bit, the leading indicators barely moved ahead and home sales fell.
 
'No, Thanks' to the A.M.A.
 
If you can't fight 'em, join 'em -- if they let you. Sensing that the momentum for health care reform is so strong that it had better climb aboard, the American Medical Association told the White House it would stop opposing parts of the Clinton plan. And the A.M.A. also wanted to join the team. With nearly 300,000 members and a formidable lobbying budget, the A.M.A. must be reckoned with. But the White House wants to do things its way, and quickly told the A.M.A. it could express its views, but not participate directly.
 
Twin Ghost Towns
 
Some things are so imposing that you just know nothing could rattle them. The Rock of Gibraltar. The Titanic. Arnold Schwarzenegger. The World Trade Center. So if the unthinkable happens, the ripples are huge. When the trade center shut down, some 55,000 people had to scramble for those vital organs of modern business -- a phone, a fax, a ticker, a modem, a mailroom -- not to mention a place to sit. Most businesses coped in temporary quarters, but a week's closing quickly changed to a month, so the costs of all that jury-rigged commerce will surely skyrocket. More ripples: insurers started guessing at loss numbers; some prospective tenants decided to think it over; and the talk began of changing building codes, garage locations -- anything to avert similar disasters.
 
Learn Now, Serve Later
 
"Young people are still idealistic. They have not been given a chance." That was R. Sargent Shriver, the first Peace Corps director, speaking of President Clinton's national service proposal to help students pay tuition debts. Mr. Shriver was a fitting cheerleader, for in outlining the plan Mr. Clinton evoked the Peace Corps, calling on students to "answer the call to service" at home.

The Cartoon's New Clothes
 
There's no dispute: All of life is an education. But when lawmakers enacted the Children's Television Act in 1990, they had something a bit more rigorous in mind -- and it did not include "The Flintstones." Broadcasters had to show a commitment to educational needs, but the Bush-era F.C.C. let stations classify many cartoons as educational. Well, no longer, the F.C.C. said last week. In fact, the agency has recently delayed relicensing seven stations. (This Diary entry has been brought to you by the letter "B" and the number "2.")
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Fresh Start at NBC News
 
NBC News may have hit bottom last month when it made an on-air apology to General Motors for faking a truck crash. Now, it certainly hopes, things have to get better. And in what may be a sign of that new era, the division's president, Michael G. Gartner, resigned last week. It had been Mr. Gartner's grim task to cut jobs and costs -- and to scramble for profits. And some staff members said that scramble set the tone for an erosion of journalistic values that culminated in the faked crash. Now the lesson is learned, the costs have been cut, so NBC News may be able to wake from its nightmare.

A G.M. Offer They Didn't Refuse
 
Shrinkage at big companies involves numerous painful job losses. But many workers, it seems, are all too happy to go -- if the price is right. When General Motors offered older workers early retirement, it expected about 9,000 takers, but by last week's deadline nearly twice that many had accepted. The 16,500 workers will get full pensions, health care and life insurance, and those over 62 will get $13,000 toward a new car (not, of course, a Dodge or a Toyota). The younger retirees may accept other jobs without penalty, so the number of takers could be seen as more hopeful news on the job front -- they must sense good opportunities out there.
 
Salomon Bets Big, and Loses Big
 
Salomon Inc. is an aggressive gambler in the bond market. And when it's good, it's very, very good: in 1992 it earned $550 million, a welcome rebound after the 1991 Treasury auction scandal. But this year has been horrid: Salomon said last week that it had lost $250 million so far -- probably because it failed to bet that interest rates would drop as far as they have. Treasury bond yields have fallen from 7.5 percent in January to well below 7 percent.
 
RJR Shares, Hold the Tobacco
 
As more people kick the tobacco habit, they tend to kick the tobacco companies, too. Some may simply recoil from investing in the destruction of millions of lungs, while others want protection from liability lawsuits or new "sin taxes." So RJR Nabisco's latest message to those investors is this: Buy Oreos, not Winstons. The company will issue new stock tied to the performance of its food business, hoping to raise at least $1.5 billion by selling 93 million shares of what will be called RN-Nabisco Group. The proceeds will enable the company to start paying dividends. But some of tobacco's risks will remain, for though the dividends will be tied to food, the shares will still represent ownership of the entire company.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Business, Italian-Style
 
In Italy, business as usual has proved to be mighty strange. Major political parties, with ties to municipalities and state companies, awarded contracts in return for contributions. Companies banded together to decide who got which contract. Greasing all these wheels was a steady stream of bribes, which sucked billions of dollars out of the economy. But the whole thing has come unglued lately. Two party leaders and three Cabinet ministers have resigned, seven people facing questioning have committed suicide and 50 members of Parliament are under investigation.
 
Look, Mr. Clinton, No Subsidies!
 
After President Clinton railed at Airbus for gorging on subsidies while Boeing scraped its plate, the Europeans did not exactly slink into a corner. Far from it. Last week the consortium brought forth its latest weapon in the sky wars -- its new A321. And look, it said, no subsidies! This one was built without government support. Well, sort of: The A321 is basically a larger A320, which got substantial support. But subsidies or not, Airbus was proud. "This is an outstanding example," an executive said, of what Europeans can do "when they work together." Then, with a trans-Atlantic nod, he said he would not comment on the "uncalled-for noises from America." After all the noise, though, what's left is that the A321 -- whoever paid for it -- will be a potent rival to Boeing's planes, and could pose a real threat to McDonnell Douglas.
 
Bleak Tidings From Europe
 
Lest anyone forget that America's economy has not been alone in its hard times, two giants of European business had some bleak news last week. Philips, the Dutch consumer electronics company, and Groupe Bull, the French computer maker, posted substantial 1992 losses and announced plans for new layoffs. Groupe Bull cited plunging European prices for supercomputers, while Philips put part of the blame on sharp price declines on products like televisions. And Philips "does not expect a recovery of the world economy" in 1993, though it said "prospects are relatively better in the United States."
 
Germany Cuts Rates After All
 
Many people have said Germany has the power to promote stronger growth in Europe by relaxing its tight monetary policy, and pressure has mounted on the Bundesbank to cut interest rates. Last week, in a surprise move, the central bank complied, lowering one short-term rate and signaling its intention to continue cautiously guiding rates downward. Apart from outside pressure, the Bundesbank had a compelling internal reason to act: the recession gripping Germany. As added evidence of economic weakness, the unemployment rate in the West rose to 7.5 percent.

His dreadlocks balled into a cap, Ben Roth dipped into a canvas sack and pulled out a T-shirt with a familiar, if antiquated, symbol of seven green blades. He barked a sales pitch that rose above the French Quarter and a crowd staggeringly heavy with beer and beads.
"Happy Mardi Grass!" he yelled, making sure no one missed the hiss of the extra S. "Roll a fat one for Tuesday!" 
 The joke worked. Within an hour, Mr. Roth, 18, and his friend R. J. Cote, who are members of a new group called the Cannabis Action Network, sold some 40 T-shirts and dozens of cloth pot-leaf leis so realistic that a garage worker asked Mr. Roth to roll him a joint.
But the two were more serious than they seemed: during Mardi Gras last month, a dozen scraggly young members of CAN passed out 10,000 pamphlets about the supposed virtues -- environmental, political, social and recreational -- of Cannabis sativa, the plant that mellowed a generation and is now in the midst of a surge of publicity, even though marijuana is still considered by many to be a dangerous drug.
Studies indicate that pot use is down from five years ago, but something serious is happening with the stuff that no one calls marijuana anymore. These days, it's hemp, cannabis or just plain pot, and from music to fashion to social consciousness, its culture is reconfiguring itself with a strong environmental twist, one that seems to fit the ethos of this new greener decade.
Pot's image in the 80's shared the fate of the hippie: it seemed low-rent, even quaint, as cocaine and cash rose as more potent symbols. Look around now: President Clinton is a self-described puffer, and Vice President Al Gore is an admitted inhaler. The long-discredited pot leaf, once a symbol of watery eyes and no ambition, appears increasingly on baseball caps, T-shirts and jewelry. The crinkled joint has been replaced by the "blunt," a hollowed-out cigar filled with pot that has made the Phillies Blunt an underground hip-hop icon, to the annoyance of the cigar makers.
In music, groups from Cypress Hill to the neo-hippie Black Crowes, are celebrating pot, urging its legalization in concerts and interviews. Last month, Sacred Reich, a band on a Disney label, sent out promotional bongs. A 15-song compact disk, "Marijuana's Greatest Hits Revisited," was recently released by Re-Hash Records in Nashville.
And in "Doonesbury" Zonker was recently raided as he prepared pot brownies for chemotherapy patients.
This hyped-up revival of marijuana imagery in pop culture has its underpinnings in a resurgence in outspoken advocacy for the drug. No one believes that legalization is anywhere near, but after a 12-year war on drugs, pot's proponents are trying again, this time with a glimmer of hope that they can make a change. At the forefront of the new groups is the Cannabis Action Network, a small band of young true believers who crisscross the country preaching a revisionist argument for legalization. In what many call a linguistic sleight of hand, their message is heavy on hemp, the old name for the once-legal and widely cultivated marijuana plant used for canvas, paper and paint.
The tactic, shared by many "hempheads," has an oddly historical and environmental appeal; in addition, it allows advocates to talk about pot without mentioning that it gets you high. But the sell has its dangers.
"On the one hand, it certainly worked to spark activity," said David Fratello of the Drug Policy Institute, a Washington research group whose reports favor legalization. "But to some degree it's dishonest. Because so many of the hemp activists are also marijuana-use activists. People should be allowed to be marijuana-use activists, but it's interesting that this is how they found their voice."
And what of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or Norml, the oldest pro-pot group, whose primary goal is legalization of the drug for medical uses? After a decade-long cultural coma, the 23-year-old organization is showing signs of renewal, one that's been generated in part by the activities of groups like CAN.
"There is an organized movement on the part of Norml and others to sort of bring this up again," said William Ruzzamenti, the chief of public affairs at the Drug Enforcement Administration. "They are trying to sell people a bill of goods, frankly."
The Drug Enforcement Administration believes that the current interest in pot is nothing more than a cultural blip, one that's fading fast despite all the hype. Although 11 states, including New York and California, have decriminalized pot use to some extent by making the possession of small amounts a misdemeanor, the agency notes that in 1990 Alaska voted to reinstate criminal penalties for possession. Currently, there are no credible efforts for legalization in any state.
And, of course, marijuana is a drug.
"Although the evidence is not as good as we would like it, it appears that long-term marijuana use in general -- and not that it happens to everyone -- impairs memory, energy and motivational levels," said Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, a former deputy director of the National Drug Policy Office who now oversees substance-abuse programs at Columbia University. "There also appear to be long-term effects on the lungs and the immune system."
In Washington, Richard Cowan, 52, sat in a bare office, one of many signs that he has not quite settled into his new job as the head of Norml. He could not be less like the retro-hippies of CAN: he is a kind of retro-white guy, with fatherly diction, a graying mustache and a gleaming gold ring, Yale College, class of 1962. The balding former Texas oil millionaire describes himself as "rabidly anti-Communist and politically incorrect." He is also a daily pot smoker.
"I like the fact that he is bald," said Rob Kampia, the student body president at Pennsylvania State University and a former local Norml leader. "We already have the far left, so we don't need a hippie leading Norml. We need someone who is going to be more accessible to the middle."
Mr. Cowan said, "It's all part of the costume." But it is the costume he has worn all his life, even when he ran his father's oil business and simultaneously wrote articles for years in favor of drug legalization, from a right-wing, libertarian point of view.
"On one level I can understand why people don't take it seriously," he said of the pot movement, which he joined after his father died and his business collapsed in 1990. "On the other hand, what is more serious than the right to control one's consciousness?"
Throughout the 80's, Norml seemed to lose control of the agenda it had set in its first decade, after its founding in 1970. It popularized the medical-use question and was a major force in lobbying for decriminalization. Though it continued its work for legalization, especially for medical uses, its profile slackened. The organization was racked by debt, and it lost touch with many of its 74 local chapters. Most important, it also lost touch with many young pot smokers, the people CAN is attracting.
"What their success demonstrates is that there is a market for ideas out there that we have not been exploiting for some time, and in that regard it's extremely useful to us," Mr. Cowan said.
To succeed, Mr. Cowan must work several angles: first, he must get Norml's house in order with regular mailings and fund-raisers, an effort showing some progress. But as important, he must re-establish the organization's credibility, not only in circles of power but with what might be called the grass-roots pot smoker. For that, he is trying to hire Monica Pratt, 21, a founder of CAN whom he sees as a model spokeswoman for the Young Turks of the movement.
"If Norml continues to have financial problems and credibility problems, it won't continue to be a viable organization," said Kevin B. Zeese, the counsel to the Drug Policy Foundation and a former national director of Norml. "Dick Cowan is their last and best hope."
Norml also hopes to gain from the expected appointment of Joycelyn Elders as Surgeon General. She has publicly supported legalized medical use of pot.
The exact year is hazy -- maybe 1973, maybe 1974 -- when Jack Herer sat on his porch in the San Fernando Valley talking with his friend Edwin M. Adair 3d, who was also his business partner.
"One night we were, I guess we were stoned, and we began to realize that marijuana, really known as hemp, could save the world," said Mr. Herer, 53. "And we thought we were just stoned."
From that moment on, Mr. Herer, a bearded, burly man, devoted himself to uncovering what he likes to call the hemp conspiracy: the marijuana plant, Cannabis sativa, was grown legally for centuries in the United States and elsewhere. Until its cultivation was outlawed in 1937, the plant was widely used to make paper and a durable linenlike cloth. The word canvas, for instance, has the word cannabis as its root.
Mr. Herer, a former sign painter and salesman of the first order, saw greater possibilities: the plant, which grows from the tropics to Alaska, could be used as food, cooking oil, particle board, lip balm, even as a renewable resource for fuel. Hemp, he believed, could be good for the environment.
The cause caught on slowly but picked up steam after 1985, when Mr. Herer published his book on hemp, "The Emperor Has No Clothes," half text, half meticulously researched documents: transcripts of Senate hearings from the 1930's and the like. It was an underground sensation, and Mr. Herer said he has printed 192,000 copies of his newsprint book that sells for $14.95.
Although many of his claims are documented, even his allies dismiss some of his more grandiose ideas. Hemp is just one of many alternative fibers that have interested paper manufacturers, and the plant can be expensive to process for clothes. Beyond that, many who support legalization worry that the hemp movement may ultimately distract a larger public from the more serious issue of legal medical use.
"It gets to the point where it's good for MS patients, it's good for cancer patients, and it's good for clothes, and it's good for paper, and it gets you high," said Mr. Zeese of the Drug Policy Foundation. "It kind of gets to the point to me that it's like a snake-oil salesman. It's going to save the world? Come on."
Mr. Herer was the prime inspiration for the founders of the CAN and other hemp groups. It was he who was preaching about hemp in the parking lot of a Grateful Dead show three years ago when Monica Pratt, 18, a wanderer from Atlanta, happened by.
"The first thing he said was he was going to tell you something that would change your life," said Ms. Pratt, who became one of CAN's founders in 1990 and who is now being courted by Norml to work on local organizing and lobbying. "I said, 'Yeah, right.' "
"I was really amazed there was a movement out there that was trying to legalize cannabis and that there was a lot more to it than just smoking marijuana," said Ms. Pratt, who quit her job at a photo store (the chemicals hurt the environment, she said) to roam with the Grateful Dead.
She and CAN strive to create an epiphany for the public about pot's many uses. On CAN's annual "hemp tours," they travel with samples of the cloth, hemp stalks, even a 90-year-old book printed on still-white hemp paper. This year's tour begins Monday, when three members from the New Orleans office leave for the first of 250 cities that will be visited by volunteers from the group's three national offices.
Throughout the week before Fat Tuesday, when New Orleans hits a collective roar, the members of CAN fanned out through the city selling shirts, setting up information tables and collecting signatures and donations. Sometimes they looked a bit dated: at a punk rock show at the R. C. Bridge Lounge, Kevin Aplin, 29, the head of the New Orleans office, and his shaggy blond hair struck a note of cultural dissonance in the crowd of mohawks, nose rings and tatooed scalps.
Like many members of CAN, Mr. Aplin is surreally earnest as he preaches for pot. One night he managed only a small smile after a party at CAN's office, a creaky wooden house in the Mid-City section of New Orleans. The bash had attracted a diverse crowd: a 58-year-old herb farmer, a locally famous harmonica player and a fraternity brother drawling instructions on how to eat crawfish. A vice-squad car passed by several times but never stopped.
"We've had a successful free-speech statement today," Mr. Aplin said.
The people at the Havatampa cigar company want it known that they do not endorse smoking pot. For 90 years, they have made cigars, including the Phillies Blunt, that sell for about a nickel each. They did not intend to be at the forefront of revived marijuana fashion, which has blossomed into a mini-industry, with a distinctive fabric and pot symbols old and new.
"They wish the whole trend would go away," said Harry Costello, a spokesman for the Tampa, Fla., company.
But it is not going away: in fact, Not From Concentrate, the New York clothing company that is paying Havatampa to use its Phillies logo, estimates that pirates have earned 30 times more than it has.
"It's been a much bigger cultural success than an economic success," said Jeremy Hurley, one of three partners in Not From Concentrate, which made its first Phillies shirts a year ago to advertise pot use without being obvious about it.
Mr. Hurley would not disclose exact sales figures. But others in the growing industry would, and their numbers show that fashions made from hemp or those that display the once-shunned marijuana leaf are doing well.
Last year, Christopher Boucher, the president of the Hempstead Company of Costa Mesa, Calif., began selling clothing made from hemp imported from China, where it is legal to grow it. In 1992, he made about $150,000, he said. His company, which sells its goods in 400 stores nationwide, has already made that much in the first quarter of this year, selling items like pants for $90, a pancho for $100 and a hat for $30.
Unlike many in the industry, Mr. Boucher does not condone legalized recreational pot, but he acknowledges that demand for hemp products has soared because of the interest of pot smokers. "I appreciate what they have done, but that's not where it's at," he said. "The pot leaf is a pharmaceutical symbol that has nothing to do with textiles."
But Gavin Koppell, 20, the owner of a small company in Los Angeles, Hemp Gear, said his customers actually welcome the pot-leaf symbol. "I think in the 90's it's become more socially acceptable," said Mr. Koppell, who last year made $700 a month and has already taken in $17,000 in orders this year. "It's becoming quite trendy, to tell you the truth."
For every trend there is a countertrend, and the people from Not From Concentrate have lost their enthusiasm about the fashion they helped inspire.
"It was something that in the beginning it was really cool," said Lenny McGurr, another partner. "But now that everyone knows about it, it's more of a money thing."

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Volvo Aims (Gasp!) at Sports Fans

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
IT is always nice when your garage attendant knows you. It means that you occasionally get decent service, even in New York. Even when you show up with a different car.
Mine calls me "Mr. Marshall" because he can't pronounce my last name, but we always converse. As on the day when I pulled up in the boxy aqua Volvo. 
 "This new?" he said, waiting with my ticket while I got myself assembled.
"Yep," I said. "New."
"Doesn't look new," he said.
I smiled, nodded, hefted my shoulder bag and left. We don't have long conversations.
But the garage guy had certainly put his finger on what is wrong with Volvo's all-new 850 GLT. Or, perhaps, on what is exactly right for that growing cult of safety buyers -- and particularly for those who want a bit of sizzle with their security. Safe sex, automotive style.
For '93, Volvo has wrapped its big news in the same square lines that have typified the Swedish maker's body-armor for the past quarter-century, although the suit and its underpinnings represent a billion-dollar development program aimed at creating a sedan with a difference.
For one thing, the 850 is the first front-wheel-drive Volvo to be marketed in this country. For another, it has a transversely mounted five-cylinder engine, and that is no small trick, given the finite amount of space between the front wheels.
Optimum use of space is, in fact, a hallmark of the new four-door that was designed to compete in the near-luxury niche occupied by the likes of Acura, Audi and Saab. As a mid-size vehicle, the 850 is 8 inches shorter than Volvo's 960 flagship, but it actually has more legroom, front and rear, and can carry more cargo.
According to company research, it also is likely to attract buyers who are both younger and older than the current crop, which averages 41.Its sporty nature will appeal both to those who don't yet have families and to the "empty nesters" who no longer need Volvo's popular station wagon.
All the same, the 850 is a very practical car, and it builds on the safety image that has stood the company in good stead for much of its 67-year history. Volvo's current and seemingly omnipresent TV commercial opens with a man and woman perched atop an olive-drab army tank, and the 850 is, indeed, something of a vault on wheels.
In addition to energy-absorbing structures in front and back, the steel unit-body already meets the side-impact protection standard that will be required of all cars in 1997. Antilock brakes are standard, as are dual air bags and automatic seatbelt tensioners for the front buckets. In the rear, all three seat positions are equipped with three-point belts and headrests.
The back seat also features a center armrest that doubles as a booster seat (with safety belt) for children of 50 to 80 pounds. Get rid of the kid and the armrest opens to serve as a pass-through from the trunk, and both rear seatbacks unlock and fold down to provide 33.2 cubic feet of carrying capacity.
Other storage is ample as well, and the car has a large glovebox under the air bag on the passenger's side, a bin between the seats, and map pockets that actually can be used.
The aqua tester, with a base "touring-package" sticker of $27,600, carried a tan leather interior, set off neatly by the black dash with its white-on-black analog instruments.
The driver's seat, power-adjustable and with a three-position memory setting, combined with a tilt-and-telescope wheel to tailor position just the way one likes. Worth mentioning, too, is a turn signal whose clicks can actually be heard, a feature as welcome and rare today as the telescoping wheel.
In fact, ergonomics are generally excellent, and the only nits worth picking have to do with the buttons for the power windows, located inconveniently in the center console rather than on the driver's door, and the fact that the rear windows go only halfway down.
Also in the console is a toll change holder, and the 850 is replete with a one-touch button for the driver's window among other niceties. The touring option added a remote-control keychain to work the power locks, a sunroof, heated seats, and dual temperature controls to keep both front occupants happy. This year, incidentally, all Volvos have air-conditioning systems that do away with ozone-depleting freon.
Under the hood, the five-cylinder engine uses 20 valves to help pull 168 horsepower out of its 2.4 liters, sending the power to the road through the standard five-speed stick or through an electronically controlled four-speed automatic. The automatic, a $900 option, offers three buttons so the car can be driven in sport, economy or "W" mode, which stands for winter (or maybe wet), and there is traction-control for further elimination of spinning wheels.
Driven aggressively, the car will go from zero to 60 in about eight seconds, and the top end is said to be 132, although I can't vouch for it.
Driven carefully and in the economy position, the 850 will manage as much as 28 miles on a gallon of gas and, with a huge 19.3-gallon tank, it will eat up 540 miles of highway between credit cards.
I can vouch for that, as well as noting that the 850 travels in rock-solid fashion, keeping its feet firmly but comfortably on the road, no matter how bad that road might be.
Which should come as no surprise. After all, the thing looks just like a Volvo.

HEADLINE: How Much Health-Care Reform Will the Patient Go Along With?

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
EVERY politician learned the lesson in 1991 and 1992: health care has become a source of great anxiety for the middle class. Every politician learned to use the issue -- as Democratic poll takers and strategists constantly urged -- to show their empathy for the middle class.
But on health care, more than on any other issue, election-year politics is easy, policy is hard and the details can be downright killing. The Clinton Administration's official working groups on health care are confronting the biggest challenge in domestic policy since the Great Society, and arguably since the New Deal. The difficulties begin with the very basics: What does the public really want? 
 "Health care reform" is the easy answer on the campaign trail. But as many experts note, what that means to policy-makers and what it means to average taxpayers can be quite different. Policy-makers worry about covering the more than 35 million uninsured Americans, about establishing some kind of national limit on health care spending, about getting health costs under control in the Federal budget. They talk about building a system that encourages competition among health care providers and informed decision-making among purchasers.
But Celinda Lake, a Democrat who has polled extensively on the issue, says that middle-class voters want three simple things: controls on the costs they pay for health care, some guarantee that their health insurance will remain secure (if, for example, they change jobs) and assurances that the quality of their health care will remain high. They worry about rationing, waits, less innovation and less freedom of choice as potential by-products of many "reforms," Ms. Lake said. According to a recent Harris Poll, Americans are more likely to support Government cost controls than a system of managed competition, in which employers and individuals band together in large cooperatives to shop around for the best health care plan.
 
What Will It Do for Me?
 Robert Blendon, an expert at Harvard on public opinion about health care, noted the obvious but easily overlooked truth in a recent essay he co-authored: "Because health care is seen as a family, not a national problem, people will judge the proposed reform plan on the basis of what it will do for them." In an interview, he added: "If what you do looks like it's going to make costs higher and disrupt their care, they're going to get scared very quickly."
What this means in policy terms, analysts say, is that the benefits of a health care reform program must be readily apparent before the tab for it is presented. It means that price controls, which are anathema to many economists, have an appealing political rationale, at least in the short term. And it also means that all the talk about managed competition and cost-conscious choices by consumers needs to recognize the special relationship many Americans have with their doctors and local hospitals.
Mr. Blendon, who has briefed the Clintons and members of the health care task force, argues that government stepping in and "deliberately disrupting the pattern of care that families have" could strike the same angry chords that court-ordered busing did.
The Clintons have studied a recent example of an utterly failed health care program begun with the best of intentions: legislation signed by President Reagan in 1988 to protect the elderly from the cost of catastrophic illness. Interest groups mounted a ruthless campaign against the "seniors only" surtax that was levied on the most affluent 40 percent of the beneficiaries to pay for it. The program's benefits were overwhelmed by the perceived costs, and legions of angry -- and frightened -- retirees demanded that it be repealed. It died an ignoble death.
 
May Deadline
 Advisers in the White House say they are well aware of these dangers as they move toward their self-imposed May deadline for a massive new health care plan. At the Democratic National Committee, strategists are already preparing a campaign to sell whatever is produced by the Clinton task force, which is headed by Hillary Rodham Clinton. A political aide to the President said, "One of the things we're counting on is that the bad guys will over-play their argument and overstate their case." Recalling the backfiring attacks on Mrs. Clinton at the Republican convention in Houston, the aide added: "If they say, 'Look at lefty Hillary trying to bring socialized medicine to the country,' that's great."
The greatest danger, the White House is convinced, is in doing nothing. The pressure on the nation's economy and the Federal budget is unrelenting. And the expectations from the public are extraordinary. While many Americans have been unusually understanding of Mr. Clinton's broken promises, 88 percent in a recent Harris survey said it would be a "serious failure" for the Clinton Presidency if he fails to control health costs.
So the working groups lurch toward May 1; many call it exceedingly optimistic, although White House aides insist the deadline will be met. The broad outline of what Mr. Clinton wants to produce is already apparent, if vague: some form of managed competition, along with some kind of national limit on health care spending.
The meetings, held in the Old Executive Office Building, are becoming the stuff of policy wonk legend, all the more mysterious because the White House refuses to release a full list of the outside experts and consultants giving advice. One participant said the meetings have the air of a graduate seminar, which is only heightened by the shabbiness of the rooms and the heavy presence of academics. One recent meeting stretched from 7 A.M. to midnight, broke and resumed for six hours the following day.
"There's this sense of exhaustion and the real work hasn't begun yet," said the participant, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. "And I don't think they have any idea of the kind of decision-making that will be necessary to come up with a bill, not just a plan."
Some interest groups are frustrated at the secrecy of the process; a suit is already pending that seeks to open up the task force's meetings. In a sign that the lobbyists are quietly massing on the border, the American Medical Association unsuccessfully sought a seat at the table last week.
The A.M.A. is not the only party disturbed about the process: Dr. Sidney Wolfe, who heads the consumer advocacy group known as Public Citizen Health Research Group, said: "His task force seems to be closeted behind closed doors with people with unknown names handing in documents whose contents are unknown." It is not unlike the way the health care system itself is run, Dr. Wolfe says.
Others worry about the brisk pace of the work, the possibility of intellectual hubris run amok.
On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders have generally cheered Mrs. Clinton on, although Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, expressed doubts last week that a bill could make its way through Congress this year. "I just think there's a lot of skepticism about how fast this thing can move," said an aide to the Democratic leadership.
In a hard-wired radio-call-in democracy, a bill as complicated as comprehensive health care reform stirs many fears. Representative Jim McDermott, the Washington Democrat who is sponsoring a bill backing a single-payer system, appeared on a C-Span call-in show and found himself answering questions about rationing. "All the mythology is really scaring people," said Mr. McDermott, a psychiatrist in his former life.
Mr. Blendon agrees: "The President and Mrs. Clinton are going to have to be teachers over the next year. They're going to have to bring the country along with them."
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, House Majority Leader, said of the process: "It is fast, but we are in a crisis. It's just unsatisfactory for someone to be saying, 'It's too complicated, we need more time.' Time's up."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Africa, From The Cold War To Cold Shoulders

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
HAVING been carved up and colonized by European powers and turned into pawns, knights and rooks on a cold war chessboard by the superpowers, Africa now faces a devastating new problem: indifference.
Writing in the current issue of Foreign Affairs Quarterly, Marguerite Michaels, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted that the disintegration of the Soviet Union "set America free to pursue its own interests in Africa -- and it found that it did not have any." 
 It is a harsh assessment. But with the end of the cold war, Africa's strategic importance to the West has declined. With shrinking per capita income hampering the development of markets for Western goods, political instability and a poorly educated work force making investment unattractive, and declining demand in the West for many of the continent's raw materials like copper and cobalt, Africa's economic significance has been reduced. Humanitarian impulses may keep the West engaged but, as has been shown by Ethiopia and Somalia, those impulses seem to be triggered only when countries have slid into chaos and famine.
Evidence of the world's fatigue with the unremitting problems of Africa or its fumbling when it has become engaged are both real and symbolic. The United Nations failed to disarm both sides in the Angolan conflict before holding elections there in September and then watched helplessly as the apparent loser, Jonas Savimbi, took up arms after the results were in. In Mozambique, both sides in a long civil war seem committed to a peace settlement, but the United Nations has yet to deploy a peacekeeping force to insure that the agreement sticks. Zaire's autocratic President, Mobutu Sese Seko, rewarded handsomely by the United States during the cold war for his staunch anti-communism, so far has easily resisted pressure to democratize from the Americans as well as from Belgium, the former colonial power, and France. His country, facing secessionist pressures and growing lawlessness by unpaid soldiers, is slouching toward anarchy.
Meanwhile, the State Department, focusing on Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, has cut 70 positions from its Bureau of African Affairs and closed down consulates or embassies in Kenya, Cameroon, Nigeria and the Comoro Islands. The Agency for International Development has slashed staff and programs serving Africa, and only the 11th-hour intervention of the Congressional Black Caucus kept the House Foreign Affairs Committee from merging its Africa subcommittee with the panel handling Latin America. Though recent Administrations have spoken of the continent's importance, no President has set foot in sub-Saharan Africa since Jimmy Carter in 1978.
 
'Diminishing Interest'
 "I'm not nostalgic about the cold war," Salim A. Salim, Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity, said during a speech last week in Washington. "I am very happy the cold war is over. What I am saying is that there is diminishing interest in the issues of real human concern."
The issues are manifold. Though aid has increased dramatically since the mid-1980's, African countries remain saddled with debt and there is virtually no new commercial lending. While direct private investment has tripled in Latin America and increased fivefold in East Asia since 1985, it has declined in Africa. AIDS continues to ravage Africa; the World Health Organization reports that 7.5 million of the 12 million adults worldwide infected with the H.I.V. virus are African. And from the Horn of Africa to the bulge to central and southern Africa, wars, chaos and ethnic conflict seem all too much the order of the day.
But to view Africa as nothing but a bleak landscape is to miss the blossoms among the weeds. "If you look from one week to the next, the cup is more empty than full," said a State Department official. "But if you look over the last few years, the overall trend is in the right direction. The number of democratic elections is going up. The number of economic liberalization programs is going up."
Peace is holding in Mozambique and in Namibia, which won independence in 1990 after decades of rule by South Africa in defiance of the United Nations. Kenya, Zambia, Ethiopia, Mali and Benin are inching, or in some places running, toward multiparty democracy after decades of one-party rule or military dictatorship. (The democratically elected Zambian Government's roundup of opponents last week under a state of emergency illustrated the fragility of the trend in some places.) Under prodding by the World Bank, 26 countries have restructured their economies and are expanding their trade. South Africa is moving toward multiracial democracy. If successful, it could turn from a pariah into a democratic example for the multi-ethnic nations of black Africa, and become a trading partner and source of capital for the rest of southern Africa.
Perhaps the most significant development is the willingness of Africans to admit their own past mistakes -- to stop placing the blame for the continent's underdevelopment entirely on the West and the legacy of colonialism, and instead condemn gross abuses by incompetent or venal leaders.
In addition, African leaders are now willing to contribute troops to help bring about peace, as demonstrated most recently in Somalia. The shift in African attitudes first became evident in 1990, when West African states concluded that if they didn't do something about the strife in Liberia to insure the stability of their region, no one else would; a Nigerian-led peace force intervened.
In the past, the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other African countries, enshrined in the charter of the Organization of African Unity, gave leaders cover for inaction even in the face of blatant abuses by rulers like Idi Amin of Uganda.
"We allowed the violations of human rights," Mr. Salim said. "We allowed the dehumanization of our people and used the charter as a scapegoat."
 
Big Brushfires, Dire Landscape
Angola
Peace talks between the Government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita, the rebel group led by Jonas Savimbi, broke down last week, the latest failed effort to end the 17-year civil war. Elections were held last September under 1991 peace accords brokered by the superpowers. But Mr. Savimbi, once backed by the United States, balked at results giving victory to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Health conditions in the country are said to have deteriorated sharply as a result of the war.
 
Liberia
A three-sided conflict continues. The participants: the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, a rebel group that helped overthrow the dictator Samuel K. Doe in 1990; a rival guerrilla group made up of former soldiers in Mr. Doe's army and members of his tribe, the Krahn; and a peacekeeping force sent by West African countries. It is estimated that 25,000 Liberians -- about 1 percent of the population -- have been killed.
 
Mozambique
The country is on the mend from a 16-year civil war and famine. A peace agreement between the Government and the guerrilla group Renamo has held since its signing in October. But diplomats fear that unless the United Nations overcomes delays in deploying a 7,500-member peace force, the peace could fall apart.
 
Rwanda
Civil war rages between the Tutsi, the former ruling class, and the Hutus, who overthrew them in 1973. The Tutsi, largely driven into exile, now seek to return. The conflict is made worse by demographic factors; Rwanda is Africa's most densely populated country and has its highest birth rate.
 
Somalia
The United States, which in December mounted an international military effort to insure relief deliveries, has been gradually withdrawing most of its forces as the United Nations prepares to assume control of the operation this spring. Starvation has eased, but disarmament efforts have met with mixed success and little has been done to rebuild centralized authority.
 
Sudan
Relief agencies warn of a disaster on a scale of that seen in Somalia before the American-led intervention. As in Somalia, the main culprit is not drought but armed conflict. Rebels in the mostly Christian and animist south have been fighting the Muslim-dominated Government in Khartoum since 1983. Both sides have routinely hampered relief efforts, and the Government has indiscriminately bombed southern villages. Since 1991, the guerrillas' ranks have splintered, and recent fighting among them has added to the bloodshed.
 
Togo
More than 230,000 refugees have fled to Benin and Ghana since fighting erupted in Lome, the Togolese capital, in January. Togo has had a supposedly transitional Government intended to pave the way for democracy after 23 years of dictatorial rule by President Gnassingbe Eyadema. But Mr. Eyadema has resisted calls to give up power.
 
Uganda
Peaceful after years of violence under the Governments of Idi Amin and Milton Obote, Uganda is being ravaged by AIDS. It is estimated that 9 percent of Uganda's 16.7 million people are infected.
 
Zaire
Diplomats warn of economic and political collapse as President Mobutu Sese Seko resists Western demands that he share power with his Prime Minister, Etienne Tshisekedi, who is supposed to be steering the country to democracy. Soldiers loyal to Mr. Mobutu who have gone unpaid appear increasingly bent on lawlessness.

Cuban Exiles Flex and Falter

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
Miami's most powerful Cuban exile group demonstrated its considerable clout at the national level last week, but stumbled on the home front. The Cuban American National Foundation blocked the appointment of Mario Baeza, a Wall Street lawyer, as the State Department's chief of Latin American affairs, but foundation directors were unable to seize control of a radio station that often criticizes their policies.
By nominating Alexander F. Watson as his Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, President Clinton acknowledged that his original choice for the job, Mr. Baeza, was unacceptable to the Cuban-American establishment. Mr. Baeza, a Cuban who was raised in New Jersey, enraged the Miami-based foundation by attending a trade conference in Cuba. Foundation leaders want to tighten the economic noose around Cuba and feared Mr. Baeza might nudge Mr. Clinton in the opposite direction. 
 The exile group's views are parroted by most of Miami's Spanish-language media, but not Radio Fe, which is owned by Emilio Milian, whose legs were blown off by a car bomb in 1976 because of his moderate views. Mr. Milian has accused the foundation of trying to bankrupt him so that its directors could buy Radio Fe. But last week, a group that includes his son won an auction of the station in bankruptcy court. The "new" owners said Mr. Milian was welcome to manage Radio Fe and play his gadfly's role.

Not Everyone in the Valley Loves Silicon-Friendly Government

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif.

 BODY:
ON the surface, at least, it appears that things aren't going well for T.J. Rodgers, Silicon Valley's most flamboyant cowboy capitalist.
His Presidential candidate was drubbed in the election. Sematech, the government-industry chip consortium he loves to hate, is being given all the credit for the resurgence of the United States semiconductor industry. And his name wasn't on the list of invitees to the high-tech tete-a-tete that Bill Clinton and Al Gore Jr. had with Silicon Valley leaders last month at the California Cafe. 
 Even worse, his company, Cypress Semiconductor, is in the dumps. Losing market share to American and Japanese competitors, it has shrunk to a little more than half its size in less than a year and a glossy electronics business magazine recently put his picture on the cover, hands clasped together and eyes looking skyward as if asking for divine intervention.
But is T.J. Rodgers humbled? No way.
"I'm finally angry enough that I'm going to call people back there and get on an airplane," he says -- meaning one to Washington to testify before Congress against the new President's policies. The Government, he says, has no business singling out some high-tech industries for special attention. "I'm adamantly opposed to picking winners and losers," he said. In his view, Government should offer hefty tax cuts for spending on research and development and make lots of small grants, mostly to universities. And the tax cuts, he argues, should go to middle-sized companies like his, not just to little ones, since small companies with great ideas, he says, will be showered with private money.
He says he is offended at being labeled unpatriotic for not wanting to pay more taxes so the Government can invest them. "If the corporate tax rate goes up, I have a lose-lose proposition," he said. "I can either put a million dollars less on the bottom line and take the heat from Wall Street, or take a million dollars out of R & D and leave the bottom line alone."
Mr. Rodgers, who is known in blue-jeaned Silicon Valley for clothes that speak as loudly as he does -- he posed for Business Week in a yellow tie, green-striped shirt and a blazer with red and yellow pinstripes -- earned his reputation as a maverick in the mid-1980's by refusing to join other chip-makers seeking Government assistance against Japanese competition. He called his competitors a pack of cry-babies gone soft after years of success. He also attacked the industry for rushing many of its assembly operations overseas in search of cheap labor.
 
Swallowing His Pride
 But this year, he has had to swallow his pride just as the American chip-makers he once dismissed as "dinosaurs" have come roaring back. Cypress's business making specialized memory chips for supercomputers and work stations is under assault from several dozen competitors. Moreover, the price war has forced him to stop his "made-in-America" chest-pounding and move his assembly and test operations to Thailand, where wages are 90 cents an hour rather than $12.50.
On a recent afternoon, from his second floor office with a view of the barren foothills to the east, he held forth on what he thinks is wrong with President Clinton's high-technology plan and boasted that his own "no excuses" style of management will put Cypress back in the race within the year.
He grudgingly acknowledges that he is impressed with the computer savvy Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore display. "After all," he laughs, "my candidate was blown away by a supermarket scanner."
But otherwise, he was never interested.
When a Cypress Semiconductor investor tried to convince him to attend a "meet Bill Clinton" cocktail party this summer, he first ducked the invitation and then dug in his heels and sent it back with a a brusque rejection scrawled across it.
"They wanted me to give $1,000 to be able to give my 'input' to Bill Clinton," he recalls. "I have this middle-class mentality that asks, "When the money flows, what does it mean?' Clearly it meant I would have been contributing to the campaign."
A self-described libertarian, he still prominently displays his poster of Ronald Reagan dressed as a cowboy with a six-shooter, and has no patience with the spending increases in Mr. Clinton's economic package. He is even quick to attack the Administration's $17-billion four-year plan to incubate advanced technologies through grants, tax credits for research, technology demonstration projects and Government-industry partnerships. Elsewhere in Silicon Valley, the idea has met high praise.
Increasing corporate taxes will only slow economic growth, he says, and targeting industries for special support to protect jobs is likely to kill innovation.
As an example, he said, what if the Federal Government had decided to protect core-memory technology in the 1960's? A start-up company like Intel, which had invented a new kind of solid state memory called dynamic random access memory -- now the standard -- might never have gotten off the ground.
 
Riding the Trough
 There's some irony in his disdain for Government help. After all, his company is now finishing the design of a promising high speed computer clock chip that will be a key component of the gigabit networks that Vice President Gore has been pushing as part of his national data highway plan.
"There will be a lot of free pork in the national data highway for us," he acknowledges. "But pork can clog your arteries and you die.
"One of my great fears in life," he added, "is that a big bulk of money comes out, so all of sudden there I am trying to muscle the other hogs away from the trough."
Not that he's against all Government spending. It would be easy to point out that private investment virtually always yields greater returns. But then one has to explain the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, called Darpa, and the Office of Naval Research.
Even he acknowledges that they are classic examples of what big Government spending can do right. Since the mid-1960's, these agencies have made risky investments where even venture capitalists have feared to tread.
They underwrote Douglas Englebart, a Silicon Valley legend who invented the computer mouse, windows and other innovations.
They underwrote William Joy, author of a version of Unix that was crucial to the creation of Sun Microsystems, the leading scientific work-station manufacturer.
They underwrote the work of Jim Clark at Stanford University. He went on to found Silicon Graphics, the company Mr. Clinton visited last month and praised as an example of entrepreneurial spirit.
And they underwrote three of T. J. Rodgers's four years as a graduate student in electrical engineering.
"Darpa put T. J. Rodgers through graduate school, therefore I declare that some Government money was well spent," he laughs. "I'm not going to be a hypocrite and sit here and complain about it. But it was small bucks."

HEADLINE: The Twin Towers: The Cost -- Inching Back to Life, Trade Center Tallies the Cost;
Businesses Concerned How Far Insurance Will Cover Them

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH with BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
After a week of frantic efforts, hundreds of companies exiled from the crippled World Trade Center have come back to life in temporary quarters, but the bombing itself is nevertheless shaping up as one of New York City's most costly financial disruptions.
Crude estimates place the cost of the economic havoc as high as $1.1 billion. While it will be some time before the real figure is known, it is already clear that the disaster has produced many thousands of hours of lost work, tens of millions of dollars of lost business and huge relocation expenses. 
 Many of the more than 350 businesses, government agencies and other organizations housed in the complex are hoping that insurers will cover most of their losses. But some are concerned that insurers might not pay all their expenses. And the catastrophe's cost could well end up in higher insurance rates for New York businesses inside and outside the complex, an insurance spokesman, Steven Goldstein of the Insurance Information Institute, said.
 
Disaster's Aftermath
 In the disaster's aftermath, most large companies showed remarkable pluck and ingenuity in operating at close to normal levels though at considerable psychological and financial costs. But some small businesses -- especially retailers in the trade center's concourse, which is now open but resembling a ghost town -- fear for their existence and look to emergency government loans.
"Our business is off 92 percent," said John Torres, the manager of Lynn's Hallmark card shop in the concourse. "We opened right away, Monday at seven, but there's no traffic -- a few curious people, but that's about it. I laid off about 16, 20 people. I had 28 employees, and I'm working with about seven. They keep calling to see if they should come in, but I've got nothing for them to do."
Faced with an exile of at least a month, businesses of all sizes are growing anxious about when they will return to normal. And while many companies are desperate to get back to their trade center offices, some are threatening never to return or to depart as soon as their leases expire.
"By and large, I think they are going to have to upgrade the quality of that building if they are going to expect anyone to renew their leases," said Charles H. Lott, chairman and chief executive of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., an investment bank specializing in bank securities and corporate finance.
Already there are cries among the center's tenants that its owner, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, should pay their bills. "This is going to be very expensive when we tote up the bill," said Alfred A. DelliBovi, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, a center tenant. "Certainly we will use every avenue we can to be compensated."
The Port Authority has stopped charging tenants rents until they reoccupy their premises. In addition, Charles J. Maikish, the trade center's director, said the authority was considering providing relief for the higher costs or business losses suffered by tenants. He insisted that the authority still planned to reopen the center by early April.
 
Working Conditions Are at Times Bizarre
 For most of the 55,000 people who work in the complex -- one of the nation's premier centers for industries like banking, securities, shipping and accounting -- it has been a period of hardship and working conditions approaching the bizarre.
Some 800 securities traders, data processors and other employees of Dean Witter, Discover and Company now work out of what had been an empty 100,000-square-foot warehouse on Varick Street in lower Mahattan. Forty-seven executives and other employees of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York must now commute up to two and a half hours to reach their temporary headquarters in Piscataway, N.J. These and scores of others -- from law firms to newspapers to shipping companies to government agencies -- have doubled up employees in rented spaces or branch locations, accepted the charity of customers and suppliers who offered space, or simply sent people home.
Traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange and the New York Commodity Exchange, among the only large businesses able to remain in the complex, had to resort to packing dry ice around computers to prevent them from overheating because the equipment that runs the air-conditioning is buried under tons of rubble.
What has happened this last week has been nothing less than a diaspora of a skyscraper city. Perhaps most amazing, the Herculean task of resettling has occurred so smoothly, especially given that many of these businesses rely on the instantaneous transfer of information and money for their livelihoods.
New York Telephone has installed or rerouted 11,000 telephone lines and installed wiring for thousands of computers for trade center tenants at new locations. Tens of thousands of pieces of office equipment -- computers, photocopiers, desks and even garbage cans -- were rented, begged or borrowed. The International Business Machines Corporation alone provided some 30 customers with more than 500 personal computers.
 
Economic Toll Continues to Rise
 But the price continues to grow. Workers and companies not only left behind offices and records but cars, feared destroyed by the bomb, as well.
"We've lost some vehicles I think," said Don C. Becker, president of The Journal of Commerce Inc. "My car is down there. I don't know what happened to it." He estimates the disaster has so far cost his company $100,000, assuming its cars are intact.
Government officials last week groped to estimate the economic costs. It is unlikely that the cost of bombing will reach the record $15 billion in losses from Hurricane Andrew. Still, the destruction will easily exceed the $330 million in losses caused last year by a flood in downtown Chicago.
The preliminary guess from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's office was $700 million, excluding structural damage to the center. Including the repair, New York City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman put the price at $1.1 billion, assuming the complex remains closed a month. That figure included $317 million in relocation expenses, $318 million in lost business and lost labor, and $79 million in lost retail sales.
Deputy Mayor Barry F. Sullivan said that at this point, nobody really knew what the ultimate cost would be. He suspected that others' estimates were much too high. But they could end up being too conservative. The now-vacant New York Vista Hotel, which sits above the site of the explosion, is losing $100,000 to $250,000 a day, and it may cost hundreds of millions to repair the hotel if structural damage proves severe.
 
Finding Ways To Manage Chaos
 Hours after the disaster struck, companies began carrying out disaster plans. By last Sunday night, employees were reporting to mothballed warehouses, branch offices or sister companies. Others went to special high-tech support centers created for just such disasters. As last week progressed, they began the arduous tasks of trying to recover records and documents from the towers.
"I was there Sunday for 14 hours and everything was chaos, we could not get into the office for three days," said Ward Lape, senior vice president of Candia Shipping (USA) Inc. By Friday, he was still sharing a friend's office in Long Island City, Queens, at a desk with three co-workers and a jumble of phone lines.
The Port Authority hopes to begin restoring the complex's support systems this week and allow more tenants to be in the building at the same time. As of the weekend, access was severely limited. People still waited hours for one of 35 authority staffers to escort them to their offices.
Echoing scores of others, Masahiro Nagayasu, manager of the Americas division of Fuji Bank Ltd., said his employees waited up to three hours to get to its offices on floors 79 to 82 in Tower 2. Then they had 20 to 30 minutes to race around, grabbing computer disks and files.
Others are learning how to direct employees scattered all over the place. Dean Witter has set up a six-person center to track employees' changing telephone numbers in new locations. That firm, like dozens of others, gave employees time off while it searched for office space, computers and phone lines. About 1,500 of Dean Witter's 4,500-plus employees at the trade center were still not working by the weekend.
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, the investment bank, had its headquarters and more 70 employees in Tower 2. Now, traders and sales representatives are working in the Jersey City office of Pershing & Company, its clearinghouse. Its corporate finance staff is in the midtown Manhattan law offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. The fixed-income division is in the bank's Hartford offices. And its security analysts are working at home.
The voice of Mr. Lott, Keefe's chairman, was thick with emotion as he related the generous offers of space he had received from other companies. But even so, his week was filled with frustrations. Traders initially had to guess where they stood in what they had bought and sold, and management still is not getting daily detailed briefings on whether the company is making or losing money. Even so, Mr. Lott was amazed that company was operating as smoothly as it was.
"What is missing is communication between people," he said. "We will certainly lose something because our customers are having a hard time getting through." By the weekend, he estimated that the company was still losing 20 to 30 percent of its usual business.
 
The Role Of Computers
 Many companies hope to regroup all their employees in temporary offices in the week ahead. And some were astounded that contingency plans had actually worked. Many said the hurried relocation would have been impossible even five years ago, when technology and backup systems were more primitive. For example, New York Telephone lacked the digital technology five years ago to reroute phone calls almost instantly.
Thanks to its plan, The Journal of Commerce was able to send its editing staff to its composing operation in Phillipsburg, N.J. The issue printed on Friday was two pages shorter than planned and three hours late going to press. But by Tuesday, the paper was on schedule.
Computers and telecommunications, rather than being a fragile link, made it far easier to restore operations from remote sites. The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York's wire room, through which it electronically transfers, or "wires," billions of dollars, was in the World Trade Center. But it got a backup wire room operating in its Piscataway offices within a few hours of the blast.
"More than a dozen of our people came down the chimney, emerged onto West Street, took a couple deep breaths and came over here, which is why we were up and running at 3:30 P.M. on that Friday," Mr. DelliBovi said. "We did $1.3 billion worth of business on Friday over here. That's a pretty regular amount."
For many businesses, operations are improving. The New York Shipping Association had relied on a mainframe in Tower 2 to dispatch 3,500 longshoremen who load and unload ships in New York harbor. Last week, member companies had to handle 75 percent of the workload. The association handled the remainder by "creatively rigging" a system of personal computers in its Port Elizabeth training center. Now, the group has retrieved its critical database and will soon rent another mainframe.
Smaller companies like Employees Manpower, an employment agency, are still looking for new homes. Others are improvising. Dale-Coane Inc., a messenger service, has had to rent cars because its own vehicles are inside the garage where the bomb went off and which is still sealed while the investigation continues.
Bi-Lingual USA, a language school on the 81st floor of Tower 1, is arranging for its students to come to its other location at Grand Central Terminal or sending teachers to pupils' homes. "The thing that hurts us is that we are a service company," said Koji Matsuo, one of the school's managers.
 
Some Winners, But Mostly Losers
 Some suppliers, like those selling rental equipment or emergency consulting services, have prospered from the episode. But some businesses who normally supply the center's tenants are reeling.
Mark Perry, owner of Stellar Concepts Inc., a vendor of glare-resistant screens and ergonomic computer equipment, said some 15 percent of his company's clients were located in the trade center. While he expects business to rebound eventually, he fears a cash crunch in coming months because trade center tenants may not be able to pay bills.
But it is retailers, inside and around the complex, that face the hardest times. Puddles of ice cream are melted inside a closed Ben & Jerry's franchise. Open shops have seen business drop by 50 to 90 percent, forcing some layoffs.
Small companies and retailers have lined up for aid from various government agencies like the Federal Small Business Administration, which has handed out some 95 applications. Through Friday, New York City and New York State agencies had approved $1.1 million worth of low-interest loans to 46 small companies.
Still, dozens more are searching for money. Harris Goldberg, manager of Papillon, said his clothing store in the center did not qualify for New York money because it was not displaced. He is plowing through the documentation for a Federal loan. "They don't make it easy for the little guy," he said.
The majority of tenants interviewed last week said that they believed Port Authority officials were doing their best under extremely difficult circumstances and would not hesitate to return. But as companies tallied their losses, at least a handful began to question whether they would return to the center or under what conditions. A great many people said they were livid that the complex's emergency backup and safety systems proved so inadequate. Many also complained that the Port Authority had not kept them informed of developments so they could plan.
Mr. Matsuo, the manager at Bi-Lingual USA, said he was concerned about the business's future if it went back to the complex. "Most employees are afraid to go back," he said. "More importantly, how do we ask our students to come back to school there?"
Mr. Maikish of the trade center summed up the situation this way. "The short-term reaction is going to be one of whether people want to renew," he said. "But I think they'll choose to renew their leases. I think the quality of space will improve as a result of the reconstruction."

HEADLINE: ASPIN IS PREPARING A BROAD NEW PLAN FOR BASE CLOSINGS

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is about to propose a sweeping new round of military base closings that seeks to reflect declining troop levels and changing military missions, senior Pentagon officials say.
Under orders from Defense Secretary Les Aspin, the armed services recommended in the last 10 days that at least 30 major installations be closed and as many as 150 other depots and smaller sites nationwide be consolidated or reduced, military officials said. 
 In the New York metropolitan area, the Staten Island Navy Home Port, the New London submarine base in Connecticut and McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey are also expected to be shut or reduced in size. But local officials are lobbying hard to get Mr. Aspin to reverse the recommendations.
 
California May Be Hit
 California, where 17 installations are already being closed, will be hit particularly hard in this round, Pentagon officials said. Among the bases there proposed for closing are the Alameda Naval Air Station and several other Navy installations in the San Francisco Bay area. While the closings would cost the state many jobs at a time of substantial unemployment, it would still leave it with many active bases.
Mr. Aspin and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as other senior Pentagon officials, are reviewing the recommendations and may make changes before the Defense Secretary makes his final list public in an announcement expected to take place on Friday. The proposals will then be given to a Presidential commission that was set up to review such closing plans, giving Congress political cover for the decisions.
The closings will eliminate thousands of military and civilian jobs and are virtually certain to stir intense opposition among lawmakers whose districts or states are affected.
 
Sign of the Times
 Among the other major installations the military seeks to close or scale back are Homestead Air Force Base in Florida, Charleston Navy Shipyard in South Carolina, K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base in Michigan, March Air Force Base in California, Orlando Naval Training Center in Florida and Fort McClellan in Alabama.
The military's proposals are a sign of the times. With fewer airplanes, the Air Force is cutting bomber and fighter bases, saying they can no longer justify the cost to run them. The Army lost several large bases in two earlier rounds of cuts and will probably be spared major reductions this time.
The Navy is recommending that one-third of its installations, or about 130 of them, be closed largely because many bases the Navy offered to close last time were rejected by the commission for faulty justification. With its existing installations built to accommodate a 600-ship cold war fleet, the Navy is now heading toward a total of 320 ships and submarines and must slash its overhead.
The Navy's strategy is to create "megaports" in Norfolk, Va., and San Diego, at the expense of closing clusters of installations in Orlando, Charleston and the San Francisco Bay area.
 
Many Review Steps
 "The driving force for the Navy is the $26 billion annual operating costs for maintaining the infrastructure," said a former senior Navy official who is familiar with the base-closing process.
Under the law governing the procedure for closing or reducing bases, Mr. Aspin will submit his list by March 15 to an eight-member Presidential commission headed by former Representative James A. Courter, Republican of New Jersey. The commission will have until July 1 to accept or alter the Administration's recommendations. Its decisions will then go to President Clinton, who will have until Sept. 1 to accept or reject them. If he approves them, the recommendations go to Congress, where only a negative vote by both houses can stop the process.
In its last round in 1991, the commission closed 34 bases and reduced or consolidated 48 other sites, decisions that were expected to save $1.5 billion a year after 1997. The Pentagon operates 481 installations around the country. The military has closed scores of bases overseas in the last five years, but those do not need commission approval.
Two years ago, the Defense Secretary at the time, Dick Cheney, accepted the recommendations from the Air Force, Navy and Army secretaries with no alterations except to separate projects of the Army Corps of Engineers for independent consideration.
Mr. Cheney's strategy was intended to force lawmakers to share the pain of making military reductions and avoid deeper cuts in troops and new weapons. But with the end of the cold war and plummeting Pentagon budgets, Mr. Aspin and his aides are looking at closing or reducing more bases or even increasing some to deal with necessary services.
Unlike Mr. Cheney, though, Mr. Aspin is tinkering with the military's proposals. "There's a lot more fluidity this time," said one senior Defense Department official involved in the review. "There's more flux in the process this time. Bases could be swapped back and forth from the 'closed' category and the 'realigned' category."
Opposition from lawmakers and local communities is predictably fierce, particularly in potentially hard-hit areas like Charleston, Orlando and the San Francisco Bay area.
Dan Leonard, the chief of staff for Representative Susan Molinari, Republican of Staten Island, said she was not aware that closing the home port was being considered. Emphasizing that any such list was very preliminary, he said, "the home port is very important for Staten Island and for New York."
Frank Coleman, a spokesman for Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, said that in the last round the home port was on the list to be closed and that supporters succeeded in having it taken off. He said Mr. D'Amato would not shrink from another fight and added, "As he has in the past, he will fight tooth and nail to retain the base."
In Charleston, the proposed closing or consolidation of the shipyard, naval station, supply center, depot, hospital and submarine and mine warfare training locations could mean a loss of more than 41,000 jobs with an annual payroll of $1.1 billion, said Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina.
 
Stressing Economic Concerns
 Mr. Hollings and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, plan to offer a Senate resolution in the next few days to place greater emphasis on the economic impact to communities when determining which bases to close.
"You don't want to gut the economy of states doing this," Senator Feinstein said in a telephone interview. "Making additional base closings without any meaningful economic conversion program in place is foolish."
All five military installations in the Oakland district of Representative Ronald Dellums, the California Democrat who succeeded Mr. Aspin as head of the House Armed Services Committee, are proposed for reduction or closing, military planners said. Mr. Dellums has been a leading supporter in Congress for deep military budget cuts, but the lawmaker now says he fears the Navy may spend more money at other bases to accommodate the displaced Bay area service members.
While closing bases promises long-term savings, it actually costs the Pentagon hundreds of millions of dollars for short-term environmental cleanup and other termination costs.
The Army, for example, estimates that bases identified for closing this year will result in a total savings of about $270 million a year, beginning in 2000. A senior Army official said the total projected cost of closing the bases is $650 million from 1994 to 1999.
The Air Force is winnowing its cold war bomber and fighter bases, partly through acts of nature. The Air Force decided that rebuilding Homestead Air Force Base, an installation for F-16's that was destroyed in last year's hurricane, for $500 million to $1 billion was too costly.
In the Presidential campaign, President Clinton strongly suggested that he would rebuild and reopen Homestead. But in a nationally televised town meeting last month, President Clinton made no promise about its fate, saying he would go along with the commission's decision. Mr. Clinton called the base an "invaluable asset" and promised to find a nonmilitary use for the installation.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
Goodman Obeys Adage to Vote Early and Often

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING

 BODY:
State Senator Roy M. Goodman took no chances when his legislative counsel and fellow Republican, Andrew S. Eristoff, faced a stiff race for election to the New York City Council two weeks ago. He voted early and he voted twice.
According to unofficial returns, Mr. Eristoff trailed Jane R. Crotty, a Democrat, by a mere 67 votes after the polls on the East Side of Manhattan closed on Feb. 23, which meant that the hundreds of absentee ballots would probably decide the race. 
 When officials from the Board of Elections examined the ballots, they came across one from Mr. Goodman. But the records showed that Mr. Goodman had also voted at a polling place on the Upper East Side on Election Day.
Mr. Goodman said that he mailed the absentee ballot at least a week before the election because he feared business in Albany would prevent him from voting. When he was able to reach Manhattan before the polls closed, Mr. Goodman said he decided to vote anyway, since he knew that absentee ballots could be easily thrown out for technical violations of New York's arcane election laws.
Mr. Goodman said that because he knew the Board of Elections would discover he had voted twice, he did not bother to try to cancel his absentee ballot.
"There is nothing in the slightest bit improper, illegal or unethical about this," said the Senator, who professed "some annoyance" that the news of his two ballots had reached reporters.
The Board of Elections is still counting the ballots and has not yet certified a winner in the race.
 
Paging Governor Kevorkian
 Political metaphor in New Jersey has never been particularly uplifting, but it took on a particularly dark tone last week with a statement by the new Republican chairwoman, Virginia Littell, who called Gov. Jim Florio "the Jack Kevorkian of economic development."
The occasion was a report by the Mortgage Bankers Association that showed New Jersey leading the nation in home mortgage foreclosures during the last three months of 1992.
"When Jim Florio raised state taxes by a record $2.8 billion, he caused New Jersey's economy to commit suicide," Mrs. Littell said. "Have a booming economy that you want to kill off? Call Governor Kevorkian."
The Governor's communications director, Jon Shure, responded more or less in kind. "Yes, Virginia," he said, "there is a national recession as suicidal as the Reagan-Bush policies of the 1980's." But in New Jersey, he said, "the patient is being nursed back to health."
 
Crime and Punishment
 Jim Wallwork, a 16-year member of the New Jersey Legislature who is offering himself as a conservative alternative to two moderate Republican candidates for the Republican nomination for Governor, is advocating that suspects in the World Trade Center bombing be tried in New Jersey, the better to execute them.
"I regret that Mario Cuomo and New York State do not have the death penalty, and I call for the suspects to be prosecuted in this state so they will get the punishment they deserve," Mr. Wallwork said.
Five people died in the bombing, but so far no state charges have been brought. Chuck Davis, a spokesman for the New Jersey Attorney General, noted that the crime occurred in New York and said he saw no reason for New Jersey jurisdiction.
 
Fernandez Comes Home
 Several hundred of New York City's corporate and educational top brass gathered one morning last week at Borough of Manhattan Community College to kick off an experimental program in which small groups from three high schools will take college courses via a two-way cable television hookup.
Mayor David N. Dinkins was there, as were leaders from the City University and from several corporations taking part in the experiment. So was the lame duck Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez. The Board of Education has voted not to renew Mr. Fernandez's contract after outcries from parents in non-Manhattan boroughs over his efforts to distribute condoms in the schools and to teach tolerance of homosexuals.
After a warm introduction from the Mayor, a staunch supporter, Mr. Fernandez stepped to the lectern. "It's good to be here with the Manhattan elite," he said with a broad smile. The audience roared and Mr. Fernandez added, "Just kidding."

HEADLINE: The Bill Comes Due: Canada's Health Care Costs -- A special report.;
Now Patients Are Paying Amid Canadian Cutbacks

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, March 6

 BODY:
This winter Fred Holmes took his two children, Monica, 15, and David, 13, both of whom had colds, to a medical laboratory to have their throats swabbed. A few weeks later he received two bills, each for $19.80.
Never before under Canada's 27-year-old universal health insurance system did Mr. Holmes have to reach into his own pockets to pay for such a common medical service. But bills like that are the wave of the future. 
 Like the United States, Canada, with a radically different system in which the Government uses tax money to pay most medical bills and regulates hospital budgets and doctors' fees, faces exploding medical costs. One response has been to get individuals and employers to pick up more of the tab -- like laboratory fees for some common procedures.
 
Spending Growing Fast
 Canadians are proud of a system that generally provides good medical care to all its citizens at a lower cost than in the United States -- averaging 1,915 American dollars per person in 1991, the latest year for which figures are available, compared with $2,868 in the United States. But spending in recent years has grown nearly as fast as in the United States, and is outstripping the ability of the public sector to pay.
Despite new efforts to control costs, from cutbacks in covered services to caps on doctors' fees and hospital budgets, "revenues in the public sector are not increasing fast enough," said Bill Tholl, director of health policy at the Canadian Medical Association.
Aggravating the financial distress has been Canada's most painful recession since the Great Depression, which has compressed tax receipts and cut federal transfer payments to the 10 provinces and 2 territories, which actually run the health system for 27 million Canadians.
 
A Major Reassessment
 The Federal Government used to pay half of the health system costs. Now it is down to 30 percent. As a result, the provinces have been forced into ever larger deficits to finance health care, which consumes about a third of their total spending. These deficits mean more money owed to domestic and foreign lenders, who buy provincial bonds.
As the Clinton Administration prepares to overhaul the American health care system to include 37 million Americans now uninsured and to stem rising costs, the Canadian system -- which gives everyone, rich or poor, equal access to doctors and hospitals -- is going through a major reassessment of its own.
No one wants to dismantle the most popular Canadian social program. But there is talk of changing some of the ground rules.
 
Fees Are Debated
 For example, fees have been widely discussed, even though they would contravene the Canada Health Act of 1984, which reaffirmed the fundamental principles of universal access to comprehensive care, unimpeded by financial barriers. One of the provincial Premiers, Frank McKenna, a Liberal Party member from New Brunswick, has suggested that wealthier Canadians would be willing to pay fees to insure that the poorest Canadians continue to get free health care.
"I don't believe there's another nation in the world that has such an open-ended system of health care where they simply give the dollars out, no matter what the amount, to health-care providers and recipients, without asking for some modest deductible in return for those who can afford to pay it," he said last year.
Quebec's Ministry of Health has already proposed a user fee of $5 each time a patient uses an emergency room, but has not yet adopted it. Still, it does require a $2 service charge per prescription for those over 65 who normally get prescriptions free. A ceiling limits the fees to $100 a year.
While opinion surveys show that more than half of Canadians would support patient fees as the best way to control health costs, opponents have successfully resisted, arguing that the practice would polarize rich and poor and require cumbersome administrative machinery.
Reducing covered services, another approach to shifting the burden to users, has made greater headway. The Ontario Health Insurance Plan, as Mr. Holmes found, has reduced fees to commercial laboratories and allows them to bill patients directly.
 
How Costs Are Cut
 Ontario, which insures 10 million people or nearly 40 percent of Canada's population, has cut costs in these other ways:
*Stopping payment for certain services in connection with employment, insurance, pensions, legal proceedings, recreation and education. For example, if a doctor writes a letter in support of a disability claim, the claimant pays for that service. Or if a worker needs a physical to get a job, he must pay for the examination.
*Ending coverage of electrolysis, used for the removal of unwanted hair, sometimes the result of a hormonal disorder, and reviewing coverage of 40 other items including psychoanalysis, vasectomies, newborn circumcision, in vitro fertilization and chiropractic, podiatric and osteopathic services.
*Increasing patient payments for drug prescriptions covered by the Ontario Drug Benefit Plan, which chiefly serves people over 65.
"At one time Government could afford to be comprehensive, covering all medical services," said Dr. David Peachey, director of professional affairs for the Ontario Medical Association. "Now we need to re-examine what the Government will pay for."
 
A Cap on Spending
 Pat Rich, managing editor of The Medical Post, which follows health politics for the country's 40,000 doctors, said the provinces were determined to keep health spending from rising above the current one-third of their total expenditures.
Mainly by curbing hospital budgets and doctors' fees, Ontario has capped spending on health care at $16.9 billion this fiscal year, ending March 31, up only 2 percent over last year, against average increases of 11.2 percent in the 1980's. Hospitals are held to an overall 1 percent increase.
Colin Goodfellow, vice president of the Hospital Council of Metropolitan Toronto, said hospitals had been "surprised" by the required austerity, but added, "Nobody jumped up and down and screamed." He said there was a recognition that "we can sustain quality service with this level of funding."
Still, the hiving off of benefits signals a narrower scope for the basic medical care promised under Canada's insurance system. Analysts see growing use of private insurance to cover what is being taken off the provincial plans. Blue Cross organizations in each of the provinces, for example, are now offering plans for individuals that incorporate the delisted services, according to Mr. Holmes, a health benefits analyst at the Toronto consulting concern of William M. Mercer Ltd. .
 
The Priorities
New Procedures Reduce the Delays
 For years, Government limits on medical spending have led to waiting lists for certain costly nonemergency procedures. In some provinces patients have had to wait as long as 18 months for hip replacement surgery, 12 months for cataract surgery, 3 to 6 months for elective coronary bypass surgery. In British Columbia the situation became so acute a few years back that the Government arranged to send 200 patients to Seattle to reduce the backlog.
Yet many doctors and health economists here insist the waiting has not been as serious as critics say. In the United States, they note, rationing also exists, but it is rationing by price, keeping many from getting basic health care.
Canadian analysts say that despite the financial constraints, practitioners have worked out new standards for assessing patient priority that have eased the problems. For example, cardiovascular surgeons in Ontario now have a registry for all potential heart patients. A result has been a reallocation of caseloads based on need and surgeon availability.
The registry, combined with a recent 10 percent expansion in open-heart surgery capacity, has largely eliminated delays in the province, practitioners reported. New heart surgery capacity has also come on stream in British Columbia.
 
The Problem Zone
 "The first thing to keep in mind," said C. David Naylor, chief of the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, "is that anyone needing urgent service gets it. The problem arises in the zone between where it is an urgent need and where it is safe and convenient to wait."
According to a 1991 survey by Statistics Canada, 95 percent of all Canadians reported receiving the care they needed within 24 hours.
Dr. Naylor, whose institute is an academic research center that studies the Ontario health system, insisted that "some kind of queuing system is necessary if you want to run a service efficiently."
"The alternative," he said, "is excess capacity, which is not a very efficient way to run a service."
World-class research is conducted in Canada, but Canadian hospitals and institutes cannot always afford the high technology products developed in the United States. For example, not many Canadian hospitals have $1 million to buy a nuclear magnetic resonance imaging machine, and there are long waits for the available machines. But generally, once a procedure proves worthwhile, it is adopted in Canada.
Hospitals in Canada are private, voluntary, nonprofit corporations run by professional administrators and reporting to community trustees. Yet they are also state-dependent contractors that must answer in part to the provincial health ministry.
 
Hospitals as Entrepreneurs
 Peter Ellis, chief executive officer of the Sunnybrook Health Science Center, one of the biggest hospitals in Toronto, said: "In the last three years we have received funding way below our actual increase in costs. So we've had to become increasingly aggressive."
He was referring in part to energetic entrepreneurship, the bolstering of revenues by pushing ancillary businesses, from car parking, the cafeteria and the variety store to an on-site conference center. But hospitals are also being pushed into greater efficiency and less wasteful care.
Sunnybrook gets 70 percent of its funds from the Government, against 77 percent five years ago, but thanks to its entrepreneurship, combined with contributions of private foundations and new management techniques it has shown surpluses the last two years.
 
The Physicians
With More Doctors, More Services
 Beyond the unavoidable price of new medical technology, the explosion in Canadian health costs has been encouraged, many analysts say, by an oversupply of doctors and the fee-for-service system that rewards them for seeing more patients and doing more procedures.
In 1964 there was one doctor for every 800 people in Canada; today there is one for every 450. Growth has been almost comparable in the United States, where in 1965 the ratio was one for every 720 persons compared with one for 411 now. The World Health Organization recommends one for every 600.
In Canada there is evidence that the doctors create their own demand, without necessarily improving the quality of care the population receives. At the encouragement of the Ontario Ministry of Health, the University of Toronto has just announced a 30 percent reduction in enrollment at its medical school, the country's largest. Medical schools in other provinces have also announced cutbacks.
Ontario's Deputy Health Minister, Michael Decter, says that each new doctor who goes into practice costs the province $500,000 a year. "If you continue to have too many physicians, it limits the resources you have for other areas of health care," he added.
Doctors are paid according to a fee schedule negotiated like a labor agreement between each provincial government and the provincial medical association. The latest increase is 1.75 percent, which is less than the rate of inflation.
 
Incomes at U.S. Levels
 Ontario doctors went on strike for 25 days in 1986 over a demand to be allowed to make supplementary charges. They lost the strike and had to back down. Now the doctors sit with the Government on a Joint Management Committee that tries to reach consensus. If the two sides cannot agree on fees, the doctors have now agreed to a process of mediation and independent binding arbitration.
After weighing the higher costs in the United States, including malpractice insurance premiums, which are 10 times stiffer, incomes of Canadian doctors are close to American levels. The specialists generally do better in the United States than Canada.
After treating a patient, the doctor bills the provincial health authority according to the fee schedule. For example, if a doctor in this province makes a house call from 5 P.M. to midnight and on weekends he may bill for $71. In Quebec, a simple consultation by a general practitioner costs the Quebec insurance plan $13.80; $50.80 for a complete examination.
The vast majority of doctors -- an estimated 80 percent -- work under the fee-for-service system, as opposed to salaries. But critics say this system creates incentives for doctors to provide more services than may be needed.
Some fee schedules implicitly recognize this by building in their own disincentives. For instance, the Ontario doctor whose house calls constitute more than 20 percent of his billings will collect only $41.50 for that weekend call, instead of $71. Fees drop for doctors earning more than $400,000, a situation affecting 870, or 5 percent, of the province's physicians.
 
A Shift to Clinics
 Also keeping costs up is the tendency for hospital stays to be long, at least longer than in the United States. For example, maternity cases average three and a half to four days, compared with two days in many hospitals in the United States. But Canadian hospital managers say they face the same pressures as American counterparts to reduce lengths of stays.
In its own efforts to cut costs, British Columbia is moving dramatically to shift services away from hospitals to outpatient clinics, public-health programs and home care. But the program means closing hospitals, which is not popular either with doctors or the general public.
Despite its current convulsions, Canada's health system remains very popular. Polls regularly show it is supported by 85 to 90 percent of the population. But with rising expectations on the part of the patient, ever more costly technologies and an aging population, more strains and more change are unavoidable.
Echoing a general sentiment, Robert Evans, a health economist at the University of British Columbia, said, "The message must be that business as usual is not sustainable in the new economic environment."

HEADLINE: Health Plan Blamed in Vermont Mayor's Loss

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Vt., March 6

 BODY:
For 12 years Vermont's largest city has been governed by mayors from the left side of the political spectrum: Bernard Sanders, who was one of the nation's few socialist mayors, and then his protege, Peter Clavelle. But this week all that changed unexpectedly.
Mr. Clavelle lost his job in an election on Tuesday to Peter Brownell, who will be Burlington's first Republican Mayor in three decades. Although Mr. Clavelle's call for increased property taxes clearly figured in the outcome, the issue at the forefront of the campaign was his advocacy of a plan to extend health-care coverage to the unmarried partners of city employees. 
 "It became the defining issue of the campaign," Mr. Clavelle said Wednesday. "It served to galvanize my opponents. Our door-knocking and polls showed that dominated all the other issues -- waterfront development, economic development. It clearly touched off a human-values debate."
 
Going With a Fiscal Analyst
 Mr. Brownell, a 44-year-old fiscal analyst at General Electric, defeated the two-term Mayor by a vote of 5,410 to 4,686.
Mr. Clavelle, 43, was the standard- bearer of Burlington's Progressive Coalition, which had governed since Mr. Sanders's narrow upset victory in 1981. He was the city's director of community development, then succeeded to the mayoralty four years ago when Mr. Sanders was elected to Vermont's only seat in the House of Representatives.
Mr. Clavelle first raised the issue of extending employee health coverage to domestic partners last fall, arguing that it is "a basic question of fairness and equity." He cited similar policies in Seattle and at Stanford University.
In New York City, Mayor David N. Dinkins signed an executive order in January enabling unmarried couples to register as domestic partners, but it did not deal with health coverage.
The Burlington policy was drafted by the City Council's Personnel Committee, which held several public hearings. On Jan. 11 the City Council approved the policy by a vote of 9 to 4; it took effect March 1. By the deadline for enrollment, only four city employees had signed up.
 
Cry of Trickery
 Still, the issue galvanized voters on both sides.
"This really fired people up," said Michael O'Neil, president of the local firefighters' union, who recently resigned from the Citywide Labor Management Steering Committee to protest the Mayor's handling of the matter. "I objected to the way the policy was sprung on us and not negotiated with the unions. It was a trick play."
In his campaign, Mr. Brownell said the fracas simply demonstrated that his opponent was not listening to the voters of Burlington, which has a population of 40,000. But Mr. Clavelle said he was putting principle before politics.
"Politicians can choose between pandering and exerting political leadership to create a more inclusive community," he said after his defeat. "I could have wished for better timing.
"And obviously I'm disappointed that folks were so consumed with this issue that the record of my accomplishments got lost. But I feel it was an issue of principle for me. I couldn't have done anything else."

HEADLINE: Castro May Weigh Ceding Power to End Embargo

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: HAVANA, March 6

 BODY:
President Fidel Castro said in an interview broadcast here on Friday that if the price for the United States to lift its economic embargo against Cuba is his departure from power, he would be ready to negotiate this with Washington.
"Fidel Castro would negotiate his life but he would never negotiate the revolution, socialism or the sovereignty of the nation," Mr. Castro told Diane Sawyer of ABC News in an interview shown by Cuban television. 
 "If the price of the blockade was me, it would be very easy," he said. He was replying to public comments by United States officials that an improvement of Washington-Havana relations would be difficult while he remained in power.
"Castro does not matter; he is ready to give his life for the revolution," said the 66-year-old leader, who has ruled Cuba since the 1959 revolution.
The interview, lasting more than two hours, was the full version of a conversation on Feb. 25 with Ms. Sawyer, a brief part of which was broadcast by ABC in the United States on Thursday night.
While Mr. Castro made clear he could not see a swift improvement of relations with the United States, he displayed a friendly and open attitude toward President Clinton.
"I have no kind of personal conflict with Clinton," he said. "It's a new administration." Mr. Castro added that President Clinton appeared to be intelligent and a man of peace and ethics and that he reminded Mr. Castro of John F. Kennedy.
Mr. Castro said that while the ideological divide between Cuba and the United States was unlikely to be bridged, he believed other kinds of cooperation could exist, like economic relations, financial investment and joint efforts to fight international crime and drug trafficking.
"The problems of the third world cannot be solved by cannon fire," he said.
Mr. Castro predicted President Clinton would face pressure from conservatives withiin his Administration to maintain a hostile policy toward Cuba, including the economic embargo.
"The embargo is a kind of Gordian knot, as complex as it is cruel," the Cuban leader said, referring to the Greek legend. "I'm not sure Clinton has Alexander the Great's sword to be able to cut it."

HEADLINE: With U.N. Role, New Faces for Remote Cambodia

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STUNG TRENG, Cambodia, March 5

 BODY:
For more than two decades, this northeastern province of broad rivers, deep forests and scarce population was inaccessible to virtually all foreigners except the Vietnamese invaders. Even in peacetime, few foreigners penetrated its nearly roadless wilderness.
But today, the extensive United Nations presence in this once reclusive country is startlingly evident here. Foreigners are everywhere. 
 The top province representative of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, which is overseeing the peace accord that ended the civil war, is Belgian. His deputy is Somali and his secretary Kenyan.
 
From Many Lands
 The military commander is Uruguayan. The military observer team is commanded by a Chinese and includes officers from the United States, Cameroon, Malaysia, France and Indonesia, among other countries.
The United Nations police force is run by a Jordanian, who has a Filipino deputy and a mixed force from many other countries.
Preparations for national elections in May are being made by a team headed by a Dutchman, and an Ivory Coast official is charged with promoting human rights.
"Hola, amigo!" is the way children in town greet foreigners, assuming all to be members of the Uruguayan battalion. While most people here are bilingual, Spanish is not one of their languages. Much of the population -- 63,000 in Stung Treng Province and 11,000 in the capital, also called Stung Treng -- is of Laotian origin.
The province's Deputy Governor, Koy Sarim, said he did not think a single foreigner other than Vietnamese and Laotians had been in Stung Treng from the time the North Vietnamese Army captured it in May 1970, until the arrival last year of the United Nations teams.
Hardly any were here even before the end of the French colonial presence in 1953. Stung Treng had little to attract foreigners, and malaria to discourage visits. Tigers and elephants, which used to draw big-game hunters, were virtually wiped out by American B-52 bombers "interdicting" the western fringe of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
It is a mark of Stung Treng's isolation, the Deputy Governor said, that even from 1979 to 1989, when Cambodia, conquered by Vietnam, was a ward of the Soviet Union and its allies, no Soviet or Eastern European advisers came to the province.
The town, on the imposing confluence of the Mekong and Se Kong Rivers, has nevertheless adjusted rapidly to the influx of foreigners, many of whom enjoy the spending power of a daily allowance of $130 paid by the United Nations.
Many residents have moved in with relatives and are renting their traditional wooden houses on stilts to foreigners for prices ranging upward from $400 a month. The average yearly earnings of a Cambodian, most of whom are hardly on a cash economy, are estimated at around $150.
The Blue Hotel, the best in town, earns $14,000 a month from United Nations guests, said Mohamed Warsame, a former Somali representative to the United States, who is the second-in-command of the United Nations civil administration.
Canned beers of all nations are on sale at about 35 bars, a high-flown name for the places with thatch roofs over dirt floors that have sprung up.
But there has been no widespread reconstruction of the country, and life for most Cambodians remains unchanged.
The United Nations presence "has made life a little easier for a few traders," said Johann B. Sunder, head of the election supervisors. But he added, "The man in the street suffers."
The Deputy Governor said the price of rice had risen from from 200 to 430 riels for 2.2 pounds and meat from 1,200 to 4,000. On the open market, $1 is worth 250 riels.
Teachers, whose salary is $15.20 a month are often paid two to three months late.
The provincial hospital is a filthy compound of crumbling buildings. The medical chief, Dr. Tann Theng Hor, who earns $26.40 a month, said that the Health Ministry sent medicine only twice a year and that shortages were acute. The hospital has no running water and only occasional electricity.
 
Historical Enmity
 Another problem here is the tension arising from the historical enmity between Cambodians and Vietnamese. Prostitutes, most of them Vietnamese migrants, do business in the bars and in houses adapted as hotels by the hour.
Three Vietnamese were stabbed to death in December across the river in Thalabarivat. Some attributed the slayings to the Khmer Rouge, although Khmer Rouge activity has been reported only in the westernmost region of the province. Other Cambodians say matter-of-factly that anybody might have murdered the fishermen.
Away from this town, in regions reachable largely by boat, Stung Treng's greatest natural resource -- its woods -- is being consumed. Uncontrolled cutting of the forest is being carried out by the Government army as well as the Khmer Rouge.
An internal United Nations report accuses both armies of deep involvement in "plunder." Mr. Koy Sarim, the Deputy Governor, said "legal and illegal, official and unofficial" timber trading was going on.
He said a new Government with new laws would put a stop to that. Mr. Koy Sarim, a former teacher, smiled gently when reminded that the army of the Government whose election he supports is the principal trafficker.

HEADLINE: THE TWIN TOWERS: Terrorism;
Blast Shatters the Illusion That U.S. Soil Is Immune From Assault

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
For many years, particularly as terrorist bombs exploded in Europe and the Middle East, one question that experts constantly asked themselves was why Middle Eastern terrorists so seldom struck on American soil.
It seemed, as one expert put it, that the United States enjoyed a kind of "immunity" from the terrorism that afflicted France, Germany and Lebanon. Maybe it was because there were plenty of American targets abroad for terrorists to attack. Maybe it was because, whether deserved or not, the United States had a reputation for good law enforcement and for a willingness to retaliate for terrorist attacks, as it did with a bombing raid against Libya in 1987. 
 Now, however, the assault on the World Trade Center appears to have changed that. With the arrest last Thursday of a man with ties to a Muslim fundamentalist group, experts say, the bombing of the trade center appears to be the first episode of Middle East terrorism on such a scale to take place on American soil, and the first time the entire terrorist panoply of events -- the scenes of horror, the disruption of life, the huge economic costs -- had taken place here.
 
Several Interpretations
 And yet, while agreeing that a terrorism threshold had likely been crossed, specialists are unsure how to interpret this event.
Specifically, the question is this: Was the bombing in New York a genuine expression of Middle Eastern terrorism reaching for the first time across the Atlantic, possibly masterminded by one of the terrorist networks long established abroad?
Or is a less portentous interpretation correct: that the episode was an ad hoc operation carried out by a group of fanatical amateurs in this country unrelated to any larger international terrorist strategy?
"On American soil, this is the first incident of its kind," said Sa'ad AbuKhalil, a scholar in residence at the Middle East Institute in Washington.
Mr. AbuKhalil and other experts say that, of course, American targets have been singled out by terrorists before. Diplomats, for example, have been killed in Europe and the Middle East, and bombs have been smuggled onto airplanes, such as the one that destroyed the Pan Am jet that exploded over Scotland in 1988. There have also been internal settlings of scores within terrorist groups carried out inside the United States.
And on Thursday, an official of the Palestine Liberation Organization went on trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on charges that he planted bombs that failed to detonate in New York City in 1973.
 
Familiar Technique
 Several specialists pointed out that the trade center bombing was reminiscent of a terror technique all too familiar to Lebanon: a vehicle packed with explosives and planted next to or underneath a building. That was the method used by a suicide bomber who drove a car bomb underneath the American Marine barracks in the suburbs of Beirut in 1983.
"I think a threshold has been crossed, because even if the guys who do these things are madmen, they don't distill their madness from thin air," said Edward Luttwak, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. They get their specific inspiration, Mr. Luttwak said, "from a kind of terrorism political science," which tells them when and where to mount operations.
 
Network of Sympathizers
 The trade center blast also shares characteristics with terror episodes in other Western countries, especially the series of attacks that shook Paris in 1986. Those bombings, which claimed 10 lives and 162 wounded, were believed, after a long police investigation, to have been masterminded by pro-Iranian groups retaliating against France for its support of Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war. The terrorists came from abroad, but they used a large network of sympathizers living in Paris whom they "activated" at the appropriate time.
At the time of the Paris bombings, many asked why similar attacks did not take place in the United States. After all, as Israel's biggest ally and as the Great Satan in Iranian eyes, there was always a motive for attacking this country. But unlike France, the United States had a clearer and more consistent policy of not meeting terrorists' demands.
In addition to the perception that American law enforcement was more vigilant toward terrorists than that of France, there had been less Muslim immigration to this country and thus less of a network of sympathizers who could be activated to support the actual terrorist groups.
Some of this, specialists say, may have changed. There has in the last few years been a substantial immigration of Muslims to the United States, some of whom are fundamentalists who could potentially be used to form terror networks here. In recent weeks, Israel has warned the United States that Hamas, the fundamentalist group on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, is actually controlled by groups in this country.
 
Violence Encouraged
 The man arrested in the twin towers bombing, Mohammed A. Salameh, is said to have been a follower of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, an exiled Egyptian whose presence in this country, and his open encouragement of political violence against his enemies, represents a clear example of the spread of Islamic fundamentalism across the Atlantic. Law-enforcement agents, though, have offered no evidence linking the sheik to the World Trade Center bombing.
Mr. AbuKhalil, noting that the twin towers bombing came on the second anniversary of the liberation of Kuwait, said there has been a series of incidents that could have spurred Muslims to act against the United States now.
 
'Perceived Indifference'
 "You can't belittle the extent to which Muslims were furious about the gulf war," Mr. AbuKhalil said. "And then you have other things, like the cancellation of the elections last year in Algeria to the indifference, if not outright acquiescence, of the West." The reference was to the abrogation of election results in Algeria following a victory by the Islamic fundamentalist party.
"There is the perceived indifference of the West to the plight of Muslims in Bosnia," Mr. AbuKhalil said, "and the continuing plight of the Palestinians. You have all the conditions for major terrorist problems in the United States.
"In a way the gulf war is not over," Mr. AbuKhalil said. "The United States fought the gulf war on its own terms, on its own scale and in ways it knows. Now you will have the expression of the anger of Muslims on their terms, on their scale and in ways that they know."
However, other experts perceive enough differences with the more standard operations of professional terrorists to make them doubt that the twin towers bombing marks the extension of genuine Middle East terrorism to the United States. They think, as Robert Hunter of the Georgetown University Center for Strategic and International Affairs, put it, that "it could have been a one-time thing with a few people acting for themselves."
 
Important Differences
 There are, in this sense, important differences with European terrorist actions. In France, for example, the campaign involved five bombings during September 1986, none of them followed by immediate arrests of suspects. It was months after the campaign ended before the French were able to make any arrests in the case.
By contrast, the apparent amateurishness of the tower bombing had none of the earmarks of the highly sophisticated European operations.
 
A New Threshold
 Another hypothesis is that the bombing in New York may have been a local operation, unconnected with foreign groups or governments, but it might nonetheless represent the crossing of a new threshold.
"I think it's very much of a watershed," said Bruce Hoffman of the Rand Corporation.
"From what we now know," he said, "it appears to have been an amateurish operation. But in another respect, despite ineptitude, the terrorists were able to assemble a large bomb, to kill people, and to disrupt the city. They were also able to generate a large amount of publicity. What worries me is that there's a message in that that will not be lost on terrorists abroad.
"We have the illusion that we are immune to terrorism and terrorists abroad see us that way," Mr. Hoffman said. "Now terrorists abroad may say, 'If this is what the second string was able to accomplish, imagine what a first-string terrorist group could do.' This incident may ironically make the United States a more attractive target for terrorism than in the past."

HEADLINE: RUSSIAN GIVES U.S. CHALLENGE ON AID

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 6

 BODY:
Russia's Foreign Minister said today that he was looking to the United States to put some substance into its protestations of support for Moscow at President Clinton's meeting next month with President Boris N. Yeltsin, not only through material aid but by making room for Russia in the international market for high technology and arms.
Interviewed in the Stalinesque ministry building where he seemed to be working almost alone on a holiday weekend, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev said the United States could not sit back waiting for Russia to sort out its domestic problems but must rather "actively support the reformers" -- above all Mr. Yeltsin. 
 Mr. Kozyrev spoke a day after it was announced that Mr. Yeltsin and President Clinton would meet on April 3 and 4 in Vancouver. It was also a day after the Russian Parliament called for an emergency session of the full Congress of People's Deputies, setting another showdown between President Yeltsin and the conservative legislature.
Neither the White House nor the Kremlin have concealed that the summit is intended to bolster Mr. Yeltsin in his struggles at home.
 
'Mature' Strategy Sought
 Relations between Washington and Moscow, Mr. Kozyrev said, "must enter a much more mature level than random credit lines, or humanitarian assistance, or some other measures of this nature."
Such help is welcome, he hastened to add, "but the time is ripe for a much more developed and far-reaching strategy of cooperation, including the rescheduling of debt for the long term, a place at the markets -- and as a minimum, equal terms for competition by economic sectors of our industries, including such sensitive areas as conventional weapons."
Mr. Kozyrev has contended that Russia must be allowed to export weapons if it is to generate serious income and that if it is excluded from Western markets, basic need would drive it back to "the wrong people," who were its clients in the past.
In recent months Russia has come under American criticism for supplying cryogenic rocket engines to India, a modern submarine to Iran and other high-tech weaponry to China.
 
Eliminating 'Suspicion'
 "There is a vestigial political attitude of dealing with Russia as a former enemy, a state under suspicion," Mr. Kozyrev said, adding that this view was not necessarily shared at the upper levels of the American administration.
"After all, there is nothing wrong for Russians to compete in the right markets of conventional weapons," he said. But resistance to such sales in the United States prompted old-guard bureaucrats in Russia to press for renewed sales to former clients, he said, -- "not so much for ideological but for purely commercial reasons."
Mr. Kozyrev said a "new agenda" in relations should also include "close cooperation in solving international problems like Yugoslavia and other hot spots."
Here, too, he said, the partnership must be on "mature terms," recognizing that differing interests and points of view between Moscow and Washington need not prevent political cooperation any more than they do in America's relations with Britain or France, "where there is a fundamental mutual trust and understanding." Russia has been the only major power to show some sympathy for the Serbs in their military drive in the former Yugoslav republics of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.
 
Optimistic on Summit
 Mr. Kozyrev said he was "rather optimistic" about the summit meeting, both because of his preliminary discussions with Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Geneva, and "what I hope is a shift of public debate in the United States." He cited appeals by former President Richard M. Nixon for strong American support for Mr. Yeltsin.
President Clinton has said he is seeking "innovative solutions" for aiding Russia. Those mooted so far have included loan guarantees to build housing for former soldiers and an enterprise fund for fledgling capitalists.
But Mr. Clinton and his aides have also learned, as President Bush did, that large-scale and long-term help for Russia is hampered by the abundance of Western countries holding Russian debt and by monetary instability within Russia.
On the foreign issues that seem likely to come up at the summit, most notably Yugoslavia and arms controls, Mr. Kozyrev made clear he remains committed to the policy of cooperation that has often made him the target of fierce denunciation by hard-liners in the Russian Parliament.
He said he fully supported the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that he remained optimistic that the Russian Parliament would in the end ratify Start II, despite the vocal resistance of hard-liners who are challenging Mr. Yeltsin at every turn.
The coming session of the Congress of People's Deputies, he said, was certain to bring another clash between the legislators and Mr. Yeltsin. But it would not be the first, or the last, and this is a point he said it was critical for the West to understand.
Yes, he said, a serious battle is raging in Russia over the pace of economic reform, and even a slowdown would mark a setback because of the nation's vast size, its inertia and its lack of experience in the market and in democracy. "You need really radical reform to get at least some reform," he said.

HEADLINE: Tranquil Forest Hills Is Pained by a Nude Cabaret

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
For years, people in Forest Hills have thought of their neighborhood as one of the finest, most proper places in all of New York City. For as long as anyone can remember, the premier shopping district in this premier neighborhood has been Austin Street, a tony, tranquil strip of boutiques and bistros.
But now, discord has come to Austin Street. 
 "Does your wife know where you are, sleazeball?" a woman in a crowd gathered on the sidewalk screamed the other night as a young man walked into the street's newest establishment: a club, called Runway 69, that features nude female dancers.
 
Torrent of Indignation
 The club, which opened two weeks ago only steps from the hallowed West Side Tennis Club and the cloistered elegance of Forest Hills Gardens, has provoked a torrent of indignation not heard in this part of Queens since the Federal Government built low-income housing in the neighborhood in the 1970's.
While a few have defended the club, a majority of residents, merchants and elected officials have attacked it as a threat to the neighborhood's upscale aura, though that aura has already eroded with the recession and the arrival of chain stores and discounters. The club's opponents have barraged the landlord with phone calls and staged nightly protests.
"Forest Hills has a certain image," said George Scott, the owner of Sgt. Garcia's, a Mexican restaurant on Austin Street. "It has a certain, I don't know, panache. When people think of Forest Hills, they don't think of this."
 
X-Rated Trend
 The club's opening and the raucous protests have come as adult video stores, topless bars and nude cabarets are proliferating across the city, a trend attributed to everything from the pressure the recession has put on bar owners to compete to the shift toward safe sex brought about by the fear of contracting the AIDS virus.
As these establishments have spread from Times Square and Canal Street to neighborhoods like Chelsea and the Upper East Side, however, residents have become more aggressive in protesting them, leading to efforts to restrict them despite court rulings that hold that nude dancing is a form of free speech, protected under the First Amendment.
On Wednesday, a group of City Council members is expected to introduce legislation, similar to laws upheld in other cities, that would forbid adult establishments to open within 500 feet of a residential neighborhood, a school, a house of worship or another adult establishment.
"I'm not a moral policeman," said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, the Democrat from western Queens who drafted the law with Councilman Charles Millard Jr., the Republican from the Upper East Side. "If someone wants to go into these places, that's their right. At the same time, we can say they shouldn't be in certain areas."
 
Opened With Little Fanfare
 The club in Forest Hills opened with little fanfare on Feb. 18 after the owners of the discotheque that was there hired Goldfingers International Inc. to turn it into a nude cabaret.
While the State Liquor Authority forbids nudity in an establishment that serves alcohol, the new club serves only sodas, juices and nonalcoholic drinks. Topless bars that serve alcohol do not violate that legal restriction if the dancers wear pasties.
Steven Paled, the president of Goldfingers, has defended it as upscale and "101 percent legal," saying that the club will draw new business to the street no other business could.
"The customers are all very well dressed," said Mr. Paled, whose company operates eight topless bars or nude clubs in the city, including Goldfingers on Queens Boulevard in Rego Park. "I ask them where they work and they tell me Wall Street, Madison Avenue. They're lawyers, politicians, rabbis. I don't bring anything bad to the neighborhood."
 
Unsavory Outsiders
 But merchants and residents say they fear that the club, a subterranean space entered through a shiny metal door covered by a small awning, will increase congestion in an already congested strip, attract unsavory outsiders and draw crime.
Some see in its arrival the culmination of a steady decline in the street's currency. Since the 1980's, when the real-estate boom drove up prices, the street has lost several higher-quality merchants, including Beau Brummel, a haberdasher on Austin Street for 35 years.
"What we're getting are the discount stores, the 99-cent stores," said Marianne Gotsoulia, who works as a flight attendant and who has lived in Forest Hills since 1983. "We're getting traffic we never had before."
 
The Mommies Are Opposed
 As she pushed her son, Brian, in a stroller along Austin Street, Ms. Gotsoulia said that if the neighborhood opposed a nude club -- "We have a mommies' group and all of us oppose it" -- there should be a way to ban it. "If they have designated areas for smoking," she said, "why can't they designate areas for nude dancing?"
Not everyone opposes the club. Mario Mitarotonda, the owner of Vincci, a men's clothier, said that many opponents have already forgot what the club has replaced: a discotheque that drew a young, rowdy audience. Two years ago, a shootout on Austin Street killed two young people.
"I don't want to sound like I'm all for it," he said, "but Forest Hills is changing."
 
Protests to Continue
 The fear of just that, however, has prompted City Councilwoman Karen Koslowitz of Forest Hills to sign on as a co-sponsor of the legislation to be introduced to the City Council this week. Meantime, she and Representative Charles E. Schumer have vowed to continue the protests, including another last night.
Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said there has been a chilling increase in intolerance toward businesses like these that operate legally that parallels legislative attempts to restrict them.
"What it's really about is suppression of speech," he said. "I know the people in these communities -- Chelsea, Forest Hills, the Upper East Side -- are generally liberals who say they would never, never censor, but that's exactly what they're doing."
The other night, the protesters gathered in front of the club at about 6 and soon began chanting, "Close it now! Close it now!" They jeered and heckled the patrons and workers as they entered or left the club, on occasion prompting shouting matches.
Inside, a small audience of men watched as young women danced on a T-shaped runway, slowly peeling off what little they already wore to booming pop songs. The patrons paid $25 admission -- not to mention what they paid for two drinks and whatever tips they wished to slip under the dancers' garter belts.
"It's the whole fantasy thing," said one customer, who gave only his first name, Lou, and said he was a postal worker from Forest Hills. "It's one of the great freedoms of America."

HEADLINE: THE TWIN TOWERS: The Restaurant;
Windows on the World: Where Hundreds Would Dine, Silence

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER

 BODY:
On an average Saturday, Windows on the World feeds more than 1,500 customers, including a dozen parties in private rooms on the 106th and 107th floors. But yesterday was not an average Saturday.
This entertainment machine, one of the five largest-grossing restaurants in the country, sits eerily idle. According to some who have been there since the World Trade Center bombing Feb. 26, the dining room tables remained set with silver and linen through much of last week, wine glasses were full, chairs were pushed in neatly -- as if every diner had decided to visit the restroom at the same time. 
 The explosion not only crippled one of the nation's most prominent dining establishments, but it also threw 360 employees out of work for perhaps as long as six weeks, caused nearly $500,000 in lost revenue to sundry food and beverage suppliers, and forced postponement or relocation of dozens of weddings, corporate parties, wine classes and other events that had been booked for months.
"We are trying to contact every one of the people affected," said Phil Romeo, public relations director for Windows on the World. (Customers who have booked parties are advised to call (212) 938-1100.)
 
Wine Cellar Is Intact
 The restaurant's projected losses are difficult to ascertain, Mr. Romeo said, because the staff has not been able to retrieve all its records. In 1992 Windows on the World grossed $24 million and spent $5 million on food and beverages, he said. "Everyone, from suppliers to customers, has been extremely understanding about this," Mr. Romeo said.
The restaurant's renowned wine cellar -- more than 40,000 bottles -- is sooty but otherwise intact. "The coolers went off in the cellar, but electricity was back within 24 hours, so there was no problem," said Kevin Zraly, director of its wine department and its wine school. Mr. Zraly, who was not at work when the bomb detonated, is no stranger to catastrophes at cloud level, having been at the restaurant during the 1977 blackout.
"If I were here for the bombing I would have gone straight to the wine cellar, not the stairs," Mr. Zraly said. "In fact, after the blackout I put some special wines aside for occasions like that. Why not?"
Restaurant employees are being paid through yesterday, said Tony Rutligiano, a spokesman for Hilton International, which owns the restaurant through its subsidiary, Inhilco. "They will all be rehired," he said.
 
360 Advised on Unemployment
 The 360 employees, from cooks and waiters to reservation takers and loading dock workers, have been advised to apply for unemployment benefits, he said.
Within hours of the explosion the restaurant was offered temporary office space by the nearby Hudson River Club restaurant, the Hotel Millenium, the Marriott Financial Center Hotel and American Express.
Golie Sina and her fiancee, Sohrab Shafian, both of Great Neck, L.I., had begun last December to plan their marriage at Windows on the World, scheduled for March 14. With 380 guests, a Persian band coming from California, a special glatt kosher caterer and dozens of other details, it required many visits to the tower. "You can't imagine the work involved," Miss Sina said.
With the help of one of the emergency offices set up by Windows on the World, the couple moved their wedding to April 14 at the New York Hilton uptown.
"You know, I was really afraid that our plane would be hijacked or we'd have a big snowstorm," she said. "But a bomb?"
 
Tons of Food Donated
 On the Saturday after the blast, a group of employees from Windows on the World surveyed damage in the restaurant, which was mostly limited to soot and stains from the smoke. They removed 10,000 pounds of salvageable fruit, other produce and dairy products and donated them to City Harvest, an organization that feeds the needy.
Near one of the bars Mr. Romeo discovered dozens of open beer bottles and assorted open Cognacs, brandies and other liqueurs. "The best of the best," he said.
On a nearby table, he found a note scrawled on a piece of cardboard: "Thanks for the hospitality. NYFD."

HEADLINE: The Economic Czar Behind the Economic Czars

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
Roaming the narrow halls of the White House in perpetually loosened ties and gray suits, Robert E. Rubin looks more like a graying college professor than the titan of Wall Street he once was or the power behind the throne that he is now.
As one of a handful of advisers who meet with the President every day, Mr. Rubin, the head of the National Economic Council, holds the keys to the issue Bill Clinton cares most about: fixing the economy. 
 And as the main conduit between the President and the expanded -- and potentially unwieldy -- economics team he has created, Mr. Rubin has become a sort of West Wing funnel to the President's ear on everything from trade to taxation to one of his own pet interests, urban policy.
His potentially tricky job puts him in charge of a new power center in the Executive Branch that was previously scattered among various Government agencies and within the office of the White House chief of staff. A primary challenge for the organism he created for the new President is to sidestep the temptation to trample over exclusive territory that normally belongs to Cabinet members and department heads.
 
Office Near Mrs. Clinton
 Balancing his slight weight on the rear legs of a straight-backed chair in his cluttered office on the second floor of the West Wing that shares a reception area with Hillary Rodham Clinton's office, Mr. Rubin, 54 years old, described the start-up period for the National Economic Council as a political and logistical challenge.
"We had to define it," he said in an interview. "We had to create its acceptance within the government process, and then we had to staff it, all at the same time that we were working on the economic plan.
"It has not been a relaxing period," he said in the understated manner that belies the reputation he built as the aggressive co-chairman of the Goldman, Sachs investment firm.
A multimillionaire with degrees from Harvard College and Yale Law School, Mr. Rubin supervises a staff of 28 economists, policy experts and support people. White House officials describe him as a broker among competing interests who brings private-sector instincts to Government work. Mr. Rubin said his main task was to distill the wide-ranging demands of the Administration's economic program into workable form.
 
Broker Among the Powers
 "Almost all issues have cross-agency ramifications," Mr. Rubin said. "So you have to have some mechanism for getting the views of the different agencies, or you wind up with the President making a decision based on the perspective of one agency and not knowing what six other agencies might think about it."
On paper, the new council is made up of the secretaries of the Treasury, Commerce and Labor Departments; Vice President Al Gore; Leon E. Panetta, the budget director; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, and a handful of deputies.
But Mr. Rubin is the first among equals -- the facilitator, in the words of Mr. Panetta.
"He doesn't have his ego injected into this thing," Mr. Panetta said. "He presents options to the players and gives the President the broadest scope of comment on issues so the President can ultimately make up his mind on what needs to be done."
 
Being 'Totally Neutral'
 For meetings with Mr. Clinton on issues from foreign trade to new taxes, Mr. Rubin prepares exhaustive memos outlining differing points of view. Recently, the council has been searching for deeper spending cuts to offset the new money the Administration wants to spend.
"You have to make sure that you are dealing with the President -- and with everybody else in the economic team and in the Administration -- in a totally neutral way," Mr. Rubin said. "That you express the pluses and the minuses, and then totally separate that from the expression of your opinion."
This approach carries its own weight. "The fact that he didn't weigh in made it more important when he did," one White House official said of Mr. Rubin's role in creating the economic plan.
In part because of his assumption of the broker's role, Mr. Rubin's own opinions remain something of a mystery. But as a fierce New York City booster who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Clinton campaign and was instrumental in bringing the Democratic National Convention to Madison Square Garden last summer, he has not hesitated to put his stamp on Clinton policy by agitating on behalf of urban policy -- or community development, as the Clintonites call it -- within the White House.
 
Trade Policy and the Pentagon
 His handling of that subject, which in past Administrations remained strictly within the province of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is an example of the council's interdisciplinary emphasis. Mr. Rubin has created a task force that is being run by Gene B. Sperling, a Clinton campaign adviser who is now Mr. Rubin's liaison to the White House political team, and Bruce Reed, a deputy to Carol H. Rasco, a domestic policy adviser.
Among the council's main tasks now is to coordinate trade policy with interagency groups that include representatives from several departments, including Commerce, State and the office of the trade representative.
Similarly, the council has brought economic and military officials into a task force overseeing efforts to find a peacetime role for unneeded parts of the military machine.
In these tasks, aides said, Mr. Rubin is the council's intellectual disciplinarian. Before the economic team's first meeting in Little Rock, Ark., he insisted on a rehearsal in which he threatened to cut off anyone who talked too long.
 
Seat on Security Council
 Aides said Mr. Clinton admired President George Bush's foreign policy team and hoped to focus on economic issues in much the way that Mr. Bush turned his sights abroad. Toward that end, Mr. Rubin has a place on the National Security Council, and Samuel R. Berger, the deputy national security adviser, sits on the economic council.
As the economic council takes shape, much of its actions are determined by the forces of the day. On the day stocks tumbled after word of Mr. Clinton's plan to propose new taxes got out, aides said Mr. Rubin threw up his hands when he was pressed to explain why it was happening.
Instead, he pointed nervous aides to the performance of the long-term bond market, which had remained stable. Later, Mr. Clinton and his advisers dutifully recited those indicators when asked about the stock market dip.
One adviser remembers a disagreement with Mr. Rubin about an element of the economic plan that he felt would be bad politics. After consulting with Roger Altman, a friend and the Deputy Treasury Secretary, Mr. Rubin confessed error.
"The so-called players in Washington would never have done that," the adviser said later.
 
A Softer, Subtler Darman
 Mr. Rubin is often compared -- favorably by Democrats -- to Richard G. Darman, the combative director of President Bush's budget office whose personality and intellect drove much of the Administration's economic policy and politics.
"The problem with the Darman model, the danger of it, was it was not an open process in representing views," said Mr. Darman's successor, Mr. Panetta. "It was basically an ego game between Darman and Treasury about who could replace who in fashioning policy."
Unlike Mr. Darman, Mr. Rubin leaves most of the public exposure on talk shows and in interviews to Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Ms. Tyson and Mr. Panetta.
The new economic model, the officials said, has worked because of the personalities of its leaders. Mr. Rubin once served as Mr. Bentsen's personal financial adviser and is also close to his deputy, Mr. Altman, another former Wall Street consultant. He also consults regularly with Mr. Panetta and his deputy, Alice M. Rivlin.
When it works well, several of the President's economic advisers said, the new council will slice through the interagency rivalries that slow governing, insuring that Mr. Clinton's policies are carried out with clear orders from the top.
"The tugs, the natural forces will tend to cut the other way," said Mr. Rubin. "Each agency has its own perspectives. And the history of Washington is for things not to work together as well as they might."

HEADLINE: As New Taxes Hover, the Rich Shrug

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
Jim Clayton, the owner of a Knoxville, Tenn., company that builds mobile homes, is one of the millionaires whose taxes would soar under President Clinton's economic recovery plan. His personal tax bill would probably increase to $3.5 million, from the $2.8 million he paid last year.
But he's not complaining. "The proposed tax increase is clearly livable," said Mr. Clayton, whose net worth was estimated by Forbes magazine at $370 million. 
 What does bother Mr. Clayton, and many other wealthy taxpayers, is the nagging worry that Congress will not be able to reduce spending, that the deficit will continue to grow and the economy worsen.
Polls show that a majority of Americans support the President's plan, but that 4 of every 10 people are concerned that it may turn out to be just another way to raise taxes.
 
Gloomy Expectations
 And a dozen affluent taxpayers who were interviewed last week said much the same thing. None objected to paying higher taxes as long as the Government used the money to reduce the Federal deficit or to stimulate the economy. But almost all of those interviewed said the plan did not go far enough in reducing Government spending -- and most predicted that the plan would fail because Congress would be incapable of cutting back on lawmakers' favorite programs and projects.
Accountants say that if the Clinton plan is enacted, and the top income-tax rates are raised to 36 percent and 40 percent, wealthy taxpayers would most likely respond by shifting investments from companies that pay high dividends to companies with more potential for long-term growth. They would do that to take advantage of the suddenly more attractive 28 percent tax rate on long-term capital gains, said Sol Upbin, a New York partner with Arthur Andersen & Company.
"There is nothing in Clinton's proposal that opens the door for people to chase the kind of nonproductive investments that were around before the 1986 tax act," Mr. Upbin said. But that could change, he added, if Congress is unable to resist the impulse to add tax shelters and loopholes for pet projects.
Most of the affluent taxpayers interviewed said they believe the Clinton plan is fair.
"I basically feel the President's plan is necessary," said Noel D. Ginsburg, 33, who owns a plastics factory in Denver and expects to pay $50,000 to $100,000 more in taxes if the tax plan is approved. "People in lower income-tax brackets will be willing to pay more taxes only if they realize that the people in the higher brackets are paying their share and don't have a lot of loopholes."
 
Forgoing a New Mercedes
 As a practical matter, the tax increases would have little effect on the lives of the richest taxpayers, whose numbers continued to swell in recent years despite the recession, said John J. DeMarco, senior vice president of PSI, a Tampa, Fla., marketing-research concern that monitors the behavior of wealthy consumers for financial institutions. "The new taxes would have virtually no impact on their life style," he said. "They'll keep the Mercedes an extra year, or something."
But some of the millionaires who may adopt more frugal habits because of higher taxes say it is the people they stop buying from who will really feel the pinch.
"I probably won't spend many thousands of dollars on designer dresses, and that is not good for designers," said Celia Lipton Farras, a Palm Beach, Fla., resident whose late husband, Victor W. Farras, made a fortune by inventing things like the paper milk carton.
Under Mr. Clinton's plan to increase personal income taxes by $126.3 billion over the next six years, the highest tax rate would increase to 36 percent, from 31 percent. This increase would affect 11 million of the nation's 111 million taxpayers, according to the Treasury Department.
 
Six-Figure Incomes
 Single people with more than $115,000 in taxable income and married people who file joint returns with more than $140,000 in income (or separate returns of more than $70,000 in income each) would pay an average of $60 more a month in income taxes.
A 10 percent surtax, which raises the top rate to nearly 40 percent, would also be levied on individuals with more than $250,000 in income or on married taxpayers filing separate returns with more than $125,000 in income. Those in the highest tax bracket would pay an average of $1,172 more a month, the Treasury Department says.
Some millionaires were cryptic about the tax increase. The comedian Bill Cosby, whose net worth exceeds $300 million, said only, "I am, therefore I pay."
Douglas A. Campbell, an investment banker in Santa Monica, Calif., said, "The bottom line is that the tax package is O.K., but there ought to have been a lot more cuts." Mr. Campbell also said that his earnings fluctuated wildly, from $60,000 to $1 million a year, and that he would probably respond to higher tax rates by working less. "I might go to law school in Mexico City," he added.

HEADLINE: For Gay People, a Time of Triumph and Fear

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ

 BODY:
After enduring weeks of vitriol in battles over homosexuals in the military, the St. Patrick's Day parade and school curriculums, gay and lesbian New Yorkers are taking stock -- many hurt and angry, others scared but defiant.
"It's terrifying that outright bigotry against us is acceptable public discourse," said Howard Cruise, 48, a cartoonist who lives in Jackson Heights, Queens. "People wouldn't dare talk about any other group, blacks or whatever, the way they talk about us." 
 For some homosexuals, the response is a boiling take-to-the-streets anger. For others, it is a visceral despair poured out to analysts and friends. Some are scared, others proud. A few are exhausted, burned out by a lifetime of fighting that began in adolescence with their own families.
Still, though the attacks are scathing -- homosexuals as predators lurking in showers, homosexuals as child molesters -- this is a triumphant time for many gay and lesbian New Yorkers. After years of being relegated to whispers, their issues are being aired. In conversations with some four dozen gay and lesbian New Yorkers, most believe that in the long run, the debate will work to their benefit. Few want to let up.
"There is no going back," said Carmen Altizar, 52, a lesbian and grandmother who lives in Corona, Queens. "This has to be resolved sooner or later. We might as well do it now. If we turn back, we're dead."
For decades, to be gay in New York City has been to be both blessed and troubled. Thousands of gay people, seeking their fortune and fleeing oppression elsewhere, pour each year into New York -- "the Emerald City," as one gay cable show used to call it. Thousands find the freedom to be open about who they are. Yet that freedom varies from job to job.
To be gay in New York means having the city's stamp of approval, in the form of anti-discrimination measures and now a law extending certain benefits to unmarried couples. Yet it also means the occasional slur shouted from a passing car, or worse. It means being a political and economic force. It also means overhearing a colleague's anti-gay joke.
"We think we're O.K. in New York, and I guess we are," said Scott Ballard, 33, a teacher who lives in Brooklyn Heights. "But I can't help feeling it's very fragile."
Indeed, over the past few weeks, every step forward for homosexuals -- support from a President, a Mayor and a Schools Chancellor who champion their cause -- has met with a step backward in the face of vehement opposition.
President Clinton postponed an Executive Order to lift a ban on homosexuals in the military. A Federal judge ruled that New York City's St. Patrick's Day parade organizers had a right to exclude a gay group that wants to march in the parade. The Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, softened his proposal for a curriculum that was to include lessons on tolerance toward homosexuals, a proposal that eventually helped cost him his job.
There has been some good news for New York's gay men and lesbians. Much to their surprise, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a conservative Republican, announced his support for allowing homosexuals in the military. The State Assembly, by an unexpectedly large margin of 90 to 50, passed a gay-rights bill Feb. 1. But its prospects in the State Senate are unclear.
 
Upset at Clinton, Fernandez
 Some homosexuals are upset at the strategies employed, especially by Mr. Clinton, who they believe caused antagonism by putting the issues of homosexuals in the military ahead of the economy, and Mr. Fernandez, who they believe should not have proposed beginning the new curriculum in the first grade. But the objections are only minor grumblings, lost amid the electric feeling that the battle has been joined.
"We're at a crossroads right now," said Jonathan Haymes, 43, a freelance editor. "It's either going to get a lot better, or it's going to get a lot worse."
Several psychiatrists say many of their gay patients, who are often anxious and depressed in the best of times, are coming to them with a focused anger that the psychiatrists fear will lead them to turn against themselves and the gay movement.
 
Taking to the Streets
 "I'm hearing it all the time, people coming in talking about it," said Richard Isay, whose Manhattan psychiatric practice is made up almost exclusively of gay New Yorkers. "We can't overestimate how the hatred and prejudice in society affects gay people generally."
On 35th Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens, the anger is taking a different form. The monthly meetings of Queens Gays and Lesbians United, which used to draw only a handful of people, now attracts between 50 and 100 gay men and lesbians. They are planning a march in Glendale on Saturday to protest what they say are distortions being made about gay people and their objectives. On Staten Island, a protest is planned against the borough's St. Patrick's Day parade today.
"What we're seeing is a stand-up-and-be-proud-of-myself response," said Ed Sederbaum, 47, co-chairman of the Queens group. "I grew up believing I was deficient, unworthy. I don't believe that anymore. Most gay people don't believe that anymore."
 
Collective Anxiety
 Once again, homosexuals are confronted with a familiar choice: Do they press to assert their rights, thereby risking backlash? Or do they quiet down, pulling back from confrontation? For many older New Yorkers, the choice for decades was to recede into the shadows. But in the age of AIDS, that has become intolerable for new generations of homosexuals.
"I think we've been well-served by an examination of our issues," said Gerard Ilaria, 31, who counsels AIDS patients. "The reason we've been oppressed is that people have been able to nail us in the closet. Now people are talking about us. It's out in the open. It only becomes more apparent what needs to be corrected."
Yet underlying that assertiveness is a collective anxiety.
"We really don't know where the country stands on us," said David Steward, 35, general manager of the magazine "Martha Stewart Living." "The vast number of people haven't voted yea or nay on us. I wonder if this is going to haunt us down the road, especially those of us who are out. I fear some sort of McCarthyish period where you go from being considered normal to being purged."
It is hard for gay men and lesbians to calculate how much fears like that are genuine and how much paranoid. In some sections of New York, men can walk arm in arm, women hand in hand, even kiss on a street corner. But in some of those same places -- near dance clubs in Manhattan, near restaurants in Park Slope, off Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights -- teen-agers prowl, looking to attack the nearest homosexual.
Yet it is not the fear of violence that has gay and lesbian New Yorkers troubled right now. Many say they are frustrated that their positions are being distorted, that their issues are not getting a fair hearing.
"I'm tired of people portraying us as wanting to steal their children, as being obsessed with sex, sex, sex," Mr. Sederbaum said. "The more light we throw on our issues, the less it's about the issues."

HEADLINE: How to Beat the Flood: Take the 7:42 Shuttle

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TACNA, Ariz., March 6

 BODY:
It's a strange sight here in the desert of southwestern Arizona: more than 70 bleary-eyed commuters waiting near cattle pens for the 7:42 across the Gila River. Unlike other commuter train stops all over the nation, this one offers not a single glimpse of briefcases, pinstriped suits or Wall Street Journals. And the ride is free.
The Southern Pacific Transportation Company is running Arizona's only rail commuter service: a six-mile, 18-minute emergency shuttle across the Gila, which began overflowing last month, a result of a spillover by a huge storm-swollen reservoir upstream. 
 In addition to inundating thousands of acres of farmland and scores of homes, the flood has wiped out 80 dirt-causeway crossings over the river and closed all nine roadway bridges that span it. But the railway bridge near this town has proved capable of withstanding the rising water.
So unless people here want to take a 120-mile detour or can hitch a helicopter ride, the train is the only way to get from Interstate 8, south of the river, to the north side and the flood-isolated town of Roll, in the Mohawk Valley.
If it were not for the commuter service, "I'd have to draw unemployment," said Stanley Clayton, a tractor driver who lives south of the river but works north of it. "I've been here 22 years. I've seen some wet river. But I've never seen anything like this."
The train provided by the Southern Pacific, normally a freight line, will not be mistaken for the Twentieth Century Limited. It has only four cars: two for passengers, two for supplies.
And the places where the passengers board and disembark are not exactly stations. The train runs from a feedlot near Tacna to a siding near Roll.
But the passengers seem to enjoy the ride, as well as the free coffee and fruit that the railroad provides.
Most of the passengers are dike-building crews for the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District, along 50 miles of the river. But the ride is also open to National Guard troops, other emergency workers and people who have been driven from their homes.
"It wasn't really our intent to make a daily service for farmers," said David Wickersham, a district engineer for the railroad. "But they show up, and you can't say no."
Mr. Wickersham said the railroad was now trying to arrange to transport students from Roll to Antelope Union High School in the town of Wellton, south of the river.
The train costs about $2,500 a day to run. Mr. Wickersham said the railroad had not determined how it would recover that cost, which is certain to mount: the flooding is expected to last for another month or more.

HEADLINE: Israel Set to Use U.S. Loan Guarantees

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 6

 BODY:
For many months they held center stage in United States-Israeli relations, becoming a barometer of how the countries were getting along.
President George Bush withheld them from Israel to punish one Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, then handed them as a reward to a triumphant new leader, Yitzhak Rabin. 
 Now, with political squabbles set aside, Israel is about to go to market using the much-disputed American loan guarantees, which will make it easier for this country to borrow up to $10 billion over the next five years to help generate jobs for a large influx of new immigrants.
The first $1 billion in these American-backed loans are expected within a month, and Finance Minister Avraham Shohat says they will be used for telecommunications, power generation, roads and other infrastructure improvements.
While the United States is not putting up its own money -- only its assurance that it will cover bad debts should the Israelis default -- it will closely monitor how the borrowed cash is spent. Most of all, American officials say, they want to be sure that none of it winds up in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, as Washington believes was the case under Mr. Shamir two years ago with a smaller batch of American-guaranteed loans.
 
'Under a Microscope'
 Mr. Shohat has reportedly acknowledged to American Jewish leaders that Israel's spending habits "will be under a microscope" for quite a while.
Loan guarantees aside, questions have arisen about how much longer Israelis can count on the substantial amount of regular American aid -- $3 billion a year -- that their leaders have come to expect as their due. In recent weeks, they have heard fresh American warnings that while the aid looks safe for 1994, they had better not take it for granted in following years.
"The commitment of the American Government and people to Israel is not in question, now or in the future," William C. Harrop, the United States Ambassador to Israel, said on Thursday. "But it may prove difficult to maintain our economic aid at its current high level."
On Friday, the State Department distanced itself from Mr. Harrop's remarks, saying that "he was not speaking on instructions" from Washington. Nonetheless, the Ambassador merely echoed what the Israelis had already heard from others, including members of Congress.
The $3 billion a year amounts to 8 percent of Israel's Government budget and 5 percent of its gross national product, but Israelis disagree among themselves about how indispensable that total is.
 
Rabin to Meet Clinton
 Not vital at all, say some, conspicuously rightists who argue that the less that Israel depends on Washington's largesse, the less vulnerable it will be to American pressure to give up settlement activity and land in the territories. But that is not the view of the present Government, and when Mr. Rabin leaves next week for the United States and a first meeting with President Clinton, one of his priorities will be to nail down existing aid levels.
A few weeks ago, staging the equivalent of a pre-emptive strike to protect the assistance, the Prime Minister said Israel "is entitled, more than entitled" to the $3 billion it has been getting since the mid-1980's. Joining the refrain, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said inflation had cut the value of the aid package by about one-third over the years.
Moreover, Israeli officials note that relatively little of this money ends up in Government coffers.
Of the total, $1.2 billion is considered economic aid, but it goes right back to Washington to repay old Israeli debts for military purchases. Of the $1.8 billion in military aid, more than 70 percent must be spent on United States-made equipment and weapons, and thus, the Israelis argue, it helps create American jobs.
Even so, some Israelis and their American Jewish supporters acknowledge that talk about Israel's entitlement may not sit well in Washington at a time when foreign aid is unpopular and other countries also demand American attention. Israel, the largest single recipient, accounts for 20 percent of the total foreign-aid budget, and even a supporter like Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, has warned against thinking "it will go on forever."
On a recent visit, Mr. Inouye proposed new forms of assistance, like an American-Israeli project to expand the port of Haifa so United States warships in the Mediterranean could berth there for maintenance and repairs.
 
Favorable Terms Given
 Questions about Israeli dependence on Washington also extend to the loan guarantees, which provide Israel favorable bank terms that it probably would not receive on its own: 30-year borrowing, low interest rates and no repayment of the principal for the first 10 years.
The terms are so good that Mr. Shohat recently asked the Israel Bonds organization, which had raised a record $1.2 billion worldwide last year, to scale back its own more costly borrowing by about 20 percent.
But the Israel Bonds president, Meir Rosenne, argues that unlike the case with the money he raises, "there are strings attached" to the American loan guarantees: In future installments, the United States could deduct spending in the territories that it considers unacceptable, and theoretically Mr. Clinton can scrap the guarantees entirely at any point, even out of dissatisfaction with Israel's economic performance.
While the new Administration is considered a friend here, somber possibilities were brought home when Ambassador Harrop observed that the pace of economic change "has been slow, in fact rather disappointing."

HEADLINE: Cuts Threaten Investigations Of Campaigns

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The watchdog commission that investigates political spending chicanery in New Jersey, often held up as a national model of campaign reform, says budget cuts and hiring freezes are making it an ineffective public guardian.
Last year, for example, its only state car was cut from the budget and its lone field auditor, Shreve Marshall, became office-bound, no longer able to crisscross the state conducting random audits on local campaign spending reports. 
 Even as the race for governor cranks up, the two floors occupied by the agency, the Election Law Enforcement Commission, at the top of a downtown bank building here are eerily still. Desks once occupied by auditors are empty and some offices have been converted to storage spaces where boxes stuffed with old campaign reports are stacked against bare walls, their contents largely unexamined.
"We're a thin man going into a famine," said Frederick M. Herrmann, executive director of the agency, which has the job of reviewing more than 20,000 campaign reports in this election year.
 
States and Public Both Give Less
 His complaint echoes across the nation as officials in many states like New Jersey that placed strict limits on campaign spending after the Watergate scandal two decades ago say recession-related cuts have damaged their ability to enforce the law.
"States are experiencing budget problems at the same time the public is cutting back on voluntary contributions to fund campaigns," said Ron Michaelson, executive director of the Illinois State Board of Elections. He said tax-return checkoffs in states that provide matching campaign funds for candidates were steadily declining, as was the similar checkoff on Federal income-tax returns for Presidential campaign spending.
In New Jersey, the Election Law Enforcement Commission has lost a third of its staff and 42 percent of its budget since the last gubernatorial race in 1989, Dr. Herrmann said. In the same period, he said, the commission's workload has shot up because of greater spending by candidates and special-interest groups.
The commission receives additional financing to oversee gubernatorial races, but it gets no such help for the other campaigns it regulates, from municipal, school and county elections to legislative races.
Mr. Marshall is now the agency's only auditor. The four others left and could not be replaced because of a state government hiring freeze.
 
Rise in Campaign Spending
 In the headquarters offices, a lone clerk tries to keep supplies moving. Two minimum-wage keypunch operators enter names from documents into an eight-year-old computer. Dr. Herrmann says it lacks the speed and functions needed to cross-index campaign reports and sort out the clouded layers of political contributions from individuals, corporations, lobbyists and political action committees.
The commission had a budget of $1.255 million and a staff of 34 in the last gubernatorial election year, Dr. Herrmann noted. Today the budget is $895,000 and the staff is down to 21.
Meanwhile, campaign spending has exploded, driven by inflation and the rising costs of advertising. In the 1989 gubernatorial election, the commission paid a total of $15.3 million in matching funds in the primary and general election races, nearly equal to the $17 million given to all candidates in the three previous gubernatorial years, Dr. Herrmann said.
Some 25 states have some form of public campaign financing provisions, said Mr. Michaelson, who collects national information for the Council on Governmental Ethics Laws, a professional group of those involved in campaign finance and lobby-law regulation. Illinois has campaign disclosure laws, but unlike New Jersey and Connecticut, it has no provisions for limiting campaign spending or contributions.
 
Training Cut in Connecticut
 In Connecticut, where the state Elections Enforcement Commission has experienced a 35 percent reduction in nonsalaried items since 1990 and a 10 percent staff cut this year, spending on training, education and publication has been virtually eliminated, said Jeffrey B. Garfield, the executive director and general counsel. These programs are necessary, he said, to inform thousands of campaign treasurers on compliance and reporting procedures.
"The cuts threaten to paralyze us," Mr. Garfield said. "If these campaign spending laws are to be of any meaning they have to be exempted from budget cuts inflicted on other agencies."
New York State has relatively lax controls on campaign spending. "The state is stuck in the mud back where the U.S. Government was before the Watergate scandals, an embarrassment and a disgrace," said John D. Feerick, dean of Fordham University School of Law, who was co-chairman of a commission on government ethics several years ago. The panel's recommendations on public campaign financing and spending limits went largely ignored, he said.
 
No Money With New Bill
 New York City, by comparison, introduced public financing of campaigns in the 1989 elections, and received high marks for a system that imposed a spending limit of $3.6 million for mayoral candidates in party primary races and another $3.6 million in the general election. That cap has been raised to $4 million in each election for candidates who accept public financing, said Nicole A. Gordon, executive director of the New York City Campaign Finance Board.
In New Jersey, Dr. Herrmann said the Legislature's recent passage of a new campaign-finance revision bill, which Gov. Jim Florio said he would sign on Monday, was in a practical sense meaningless because there was no accompanying appropriation for enforcement.
"We already are swamped by an increased workload and a reduction in staff," he said, explaining that since the 1974 law created the commission and the nation's first public financing of campaigns new legislation expanded its duties without additional financing. There was the Lobbying Act of 1981, the Personal Financial Disclosures Law of 1981, the P.A.C. Reporting Amendments of 1984 and a measure passed late last month that controls spending in legislative elections.
Under the guise of change, he added, the latest bill, which would apply to the November election, makes it harder to impose penalities for civil violations of campaign regulations. It states that an individual or organization had to "knowingly" violate the law, a criminal standard not previously applied to punish sloppy record-keeping or other civil transgressions.
The commission's chairman, Owen V. McNany 3d, took the unusual step of asking Mr. Florio to veto the bill.
The commission "cannot possibly administer or enforce" the measure, Mr. McNany told the Governor. "It would be a fraud on the public."

When Men Hit the Women They Love

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
"I WAS a real basehead," said Juan Rios, 27. "Then I got off drugs, I started doing good. I got myself a nice girl." That was Eve. They'd grown up friends in the Chelsea part of Manhattan. Their mothers played dominos together. For some reason, three years ago, Eve decided to call Juan's beeper. They started hanging out, then dating.
"I'm like wow -- do you see what I see happening to us?" said Eve. "He said, 'It's definitely not like before.' " 
 They liked the same music -- rap, reggae, house. "Out of all the clubs in Manhattan," said Juan, "We went to all of them. You know what it is? Eve can dance."
"People would see us laugh," says Eve, 31. "They'd say, 'Are you guys friends or are you together?' "
If Juan felt tempted by drugs, he'd call Eve. "I'd be cooking, doing seven things, I'd say, 'Juan stay on the line.' We'd talk for three hours. He'd say, 'I'll come over, we'll go dancing.' "
Two years ago they moved into a nice apartment on Staten Island. He's an art director on film projects. She's a credit manager. Then she lost her job because of the economy. He was getting less work. He'd grown up in a traditional Puerto Rican home. "I thought I was supposed to take care of everything," he says. "Her unemployment ran out, we had a baby on the way, I was frustrated. Christmas was coming, I didn't have money."
They argued constantly. They can't even remember about what. "I woke up," says Juan, "I had an attitude and then she had an attitude."
"He'd swing at me and I'd be so scared," she says. "He'd smack me with an open hand in the face, a full swing. I never been hit by a man. This went on one month, two months, three." A December day was worst. "It went on 15 minutes, and he hit me, and he hit me, and he hit me. And he had our son in his arms when he was hitting." She phoned her sister, who called the police.
The police walked in and Juan was sitting at the kitchen table with baby Jason in his lap. "They seen me, they saw her black eye, they said they had to arrest me," says Juan. "My son was screaming. He was only a month but he knew something was wrong. I was having a flashback to my father beating my mother. He's changed, but he used to come home and she'd have dinner and he'd smash it on the floor and she'd have to make it again to keep peace. Once my father hit my mother and I ran across the room to stop it. He picked me up and threw me against the refrigerator and I passed out. I thought if I don't stop, the same will happen to Jason. He'll beat girls, too."
Eve put on sunglasses and went to talk to a social worker with Victim Services about therapy for battered women. Eve told the woman, "Out of all this, I do still love him. I am still madly in love with him. I don't know." She did not press charges, but moved in with her family.
Juan hated the empty apartment. "He tells me, 'It's torture being here without you and the baby,' " says Eve. "He says, 'What do you think, I don't love you? I love you. I have a problem.' He was crying. I was crying. When you read between the lines he wanted a second chance."
Juan joined a program for abusive men. They watched movies. He listened to the group leader talk about exiting the highway of domestic violence before you murder your spouse.
On Feb. 23 they had a big one. "I don't even know what it was about," says Eve. "I was having my menstrual." She thought: "This is the test, he's going to hit me, but God, I'm going to say what I feel. Usually he'd shout, 'Shut the hell up.' I'm female, but I have to say my part, too. I said it and walked away. Instead of hitting, he just left. He was gone for three hours."
"I knew if I stayed I'd do something," Juan said. "I was just driving around thinking. I had that feeling in my chest to get high."
"He came home and didn't speak," says Eve. "He went to bed. I said, 'Wow, he's trying.' I went in the room. I said, 'My God, how could a person who sleeps so sweetly have such a bad temper?' I kissed him. He woke up. I said, 'Thank you so much for what you did.' He's changing and I seen it."
For a decade, John Aponte, a former police psychologist, has run a program for abusive men for Victim Services, the nation's largest domestic violence agency. Most of the men are required to take it by the courts in exchange for having charges dropped. Mr. Aponte makes no grandiose claims. Once he tried a follow-up study of 100 batterers. Half had disappeared. Of the 50 he found, 23 had the same partner. Only 15 would be interviewed. Two said the violence was the same; one said worse; 12 said the 16-week course had helped. Last week he talked about not overloading your spouse's anger bank. Juan's homework for Tuesday is to define the difference between an emotion and a thought.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Battered City Gets Visitor: Baseball

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOMESTEAD, Fla., March 6

 BODY:
The bruising gales of Hurricane Andrew stopped battering south Florida last Aug. 24. But the tremendous chunks the storm ripped out of properties and lives are still apparent in the Dade County communities south of Miami.
Evidence of the severe damage still lingers in cities like Homestead, where there are huge piles of debris and pitted buildings. Farms that produce winter crops for the entire nation will not be able to grow limes, avocados and mangoes for at least three more years, as farmers replant the thousands of trees that blew away. 
 Many of the 65,000 employees temporarily thrown out of work in Dade County are still at loose ends, as are the 5,000 to 6,000 people who were uprooted like so many acacia trees. And the impact of the loss of $2.9 billion in goods and services over the next year is now being felt by a local economy already ravaged by the bankruptcies of the Eastern and Pan American airlines.
So how is it that a game can capture this area's rapt attention and provide a wisp of good fortune for a city of 26,000 used to nothing but ill winds since Andrew?
The game is baseball. And it is bound to leave a signature mark on Homestead this weekend, showing how a sport can rival government in intertwining with a community for better or worse.
The Cleveland Indians came to Homestead to play two games against the Florida Marlins -- today and Sunday -- with the proceeds to go to hurricane-relief efforts. Sponsorships, ticket sales and program sales are expected to raise $250,000. The major leaguers are playing at the 6,000-seat Homestead Sports Complex, their very presence a vivid reminder of how fate keeps intervening in Homestead's fortunes.
The Indians -- who lost, 9-3, to the Marlins today while making six errors -- were scheduled to move their spring-training headquarters to the new $22 million sports complex this spring. But Andrew blew through, taking the stadium's roof and much of its upper deck with it. The complex has since been repaired, at the cost of $7.5 million. But the Indians have moved to Winter Haven for the time being, and the restoration in Homestead has not guaranteed that the Cleveland club will move here next spring.
Homestead originally built the complex in the hope that a major league team would move its spring-training operations here, and that tourists would follow. Cleveland bit. After more than four decades in Arizona, the Indians were looking to move to Florida and they signed a deal with Homestead.
But the contract was not an ironclad one; at this point, Cleveland's commitment to Homestead consists of nothing more than single option years for 1994 and 1995, followed by two 10-year options.
 
Park Not the Only Issue
 "We're clearly sensitive to the situation here," said Dennis Lehman, an Indians vice president, who said the team might still end up in Homestead. "The city has made tremendous progress, but I don't think it's our right to press them any more than we have."
For the Indians, the issue is not just the state of the ball park, but the overall condition of the community, and whether it could support a spring-training team at this point.
What would it take to bring the Indians here? "If we're satisfied with what happens, if the baseball people are satisfied, then we'll be back," Lehman said. "We just don't want to make any judgments right now."
 
A Jewel Amid the Destruction
 The ball park, reflecting the colors of Florida, with its coral walls and teal seats, was festive and full today. But as the fans -- most of them wearing Marlins colors -- looked out over the grass field, they could not help seeing beyond the complex to wooded areas torn up by the storm.
Though the Indians have not yet said they won't return, J. W. DeMilly 3d, the mayor of Homestead, fears the worst. He knows that Winter Haven, located in central Florida and formerly the springtime home of the Boston Red Sox, is now trying to convince the Indians to remain there.
"I'm angry with Winter Haven," DeMilly said. "The whole country came to our aid, but because of our misfortune, Winter Haven is making an effort to capitalize. That disappoints me. This could be an incredible blow. And we don't see that there is any reason why this community should be subjected to any more kicks in the shin."
A decision by Cleveland to stay in Winter Haven would indeed be a rejection of immense proportions here. Yet it is hard for all the residents of Homestead, or Florida, to look at baseball as a totally fickle friend. After all, an expansion franchise -- the Marlins -- was awarded to Miami. And within days of the hurricane, major league baseball owners voted to donate $1 million to the area's hurricane-relief efforts.
In addition, youngsters in Homestead will play their varsity, intramural and summer-league games on fields and sandlots reconstructed with $100,000 in grants given to the city by Coca-Cola, major league baseball and the Marlins.
"They answered our calls immediately," said Bob Richardson, a teacher at Centennial Middle School in Homestead, who personally contacted Leonard S. Coleman, executive director of market development for major league baseball, to request help for the area's playing fields.
"I cannot say enough about Len and major league baseball," Richardson said. "When phone lines were mangled, when there was hardly any way to keep the communications going, they persevered. Now, where there were no fields, four are back and functioning."
By Richardson's estimates, the restored fields have already been used by 250-300 varsity players for about three weeks. Countless other children, whether in physical-education classes or summer leagues, will also benefit.
"These are the things that help restore a sense of order in lives that have all but lost that sense," Richardson said. "For our kids, baseball was the first thing they could go back to, the first thing they could touch with their hands that was normal."
 
A Warning by Cisneros
 Normality to most Homestead residents is still a strange, far-off concept.
Two weeks ago, Henry Cisneros, the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, warned that the area, with its large immigrant populations from Haiti, Mexico and Central America as well as white and black Americans dependent on blue-collar and agricultural industries, could degenerate into "a vast tangle of poor communities, uncoordinated and haphazardly constructed."
On Friday, Cisneros again declared the south Florida region to be greatly troubled and informed reporters in a telephone interview that he had made a series of recommendations to President Clinton to help solve those problems. Cisneros said his report conveyed "a picture of the job ahead and its massiveness, in fairly graphic language so that he could understand the immensity of the problem."
 
Evidence on the Roadsides
 Like any visitor to the region, Cisneros could not have helped but notice the still-exisiting crisis. Many parts of Homestead's residential areas resemble small independent dump sites, as the valuable accumulations of people's lifes -- washers and dryers, refrigerators, pickup trucks -- collect dust at the sides of the roads.
Graffiti spray-painted on houses as well as boarded-up businesses telegraph the stress that remains. One building's ominous message says, "OCCUPIED & ARMED -- PLEASE." But signs of hope are also appearing, signs that say, "Food -- Open In Rear," "Hang In" and "God Bless."
That an indomitable spirit is loose here is also evidenced in the small army of trucks and vans loaded with construction equipment that invade the area each day. And by the nails that litter almost every parking lot and street, the roofs stockpiled with tile and the sounds of heavy machinery either demolishing the old or building the new.
But for all the activity, there still are major and obvious struggles that have yet to be addressed completely. According to DeMilly, 15-20 percent of Homestead's families have relocated, temporarily or permanently.
In addition, 80-90 percent of this town's businesses were adversely affected by the storm, with 30 percent totally destroyed. For too many, trying to do business while ensconced in tents or trailers in the shadows of gutted or caved-in strip malls is a definition of stress itself.
"There are a lot of places going down, a lot of places being rebuilt," said Rebecca See, who cuts hair at the new locale for Woody's Barber Shop -- a trailer in the parking lot of a deserted outdoor mall on U.S. 1. "We don't know when things are going to reopen," she said.
 
The Base Outside Baseball
 Obviously, that is still too common a complaint, one that could apply not only to landlords, but to baseball, businesses and governments as well.
To this day, no one knows what will be the fate of Homestead Air Force base. The base was the area's largest single employer, pumping $450 million a year into the local economy. The 3,300-acre facility, where 8,400 civilian and military personnel worked, was effectively destroyed when Andrew chewed up more than 1,000 buildings on sight or linked to its operation.
The Federal Government estimated it would cost $480 million to reopen it as an Air Force facilty, and last year the Senate rejected President Bush's request to do so. Only on Friday did the Pentagon agree to release $76 million for partial reconstruction in order to allow the U.S. Customs Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration and Air Force reserve units to use the facility.
But today it was learned that the Clinton Administration has put Homestead on a list of 30 major military installations that are to be either closed or scaled back.
Meanwhile, Homestead is clawing away at the Florida Legislature for an estimated $600 million in state sales tax excesses generated by the sales of desks, cars, clothing and everything else needed by people to restock and rebuild this area. This is the sort of fight De Milly admits rips at his soul.
"I'm angry that what we are being asked to do is go back and renegotiate so many things that we thought were secure," DeMilly said. "And I'm not limiting that to the Cleveland Indians. We have to spend so much time revisiting these subjects, so much energy watching our backs."
It's an anger that two baseball games will do little to permanently diminish. But even the little respites are welcome in a town where Andrew left a large gash in a region's psyche.
"If I could ask one thing of people out there, I guess it would be to be patient," DeMilly said. "We don't want handouts, just the kind of love that was displayed right after Andrew. The needs here still exist and they will for some time to come."

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
Looking for a Good Player? The Padres Will Give Him to You Wholesale

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YUMA, Ariz., March 6

 BODY:
Most general managers spend the spring scouring rosters for players who could add to the talent on their teams. San Diego's Joe McIlvaine has spent his spring seeking ways of subtracting money from the payroll of his team. Yet McIlvaine remains determined to overcome the built-in economic problems buffeting the Padres.
"There are a lot of things here I can't control," McIlvaine said, "but come hell or high water, we're going to put a good team out there." 
 High water has come to the Padres; the flooding Gila River has rampaged through Yuma County in Arizona for the last week. Hell could be next the way the Padres are operating.
By order of the ownership, McIlvaine traded Craig Lefferts last season and Tony Fernandez and Mike Maddux in the off season and let Randy Myers and Benito Santiago go as free agents. Now he is faced with trading Bruce Hurst and Darrin Jackson to reduce the payroll to the ownership-stipulated level.
"You don't trade a player July 31 when you're in a pennant race, but we had to do that with Lefferts," McIlvaine said. "We're just on the cutting edge of what's happening in baseball. By next year, there will be others doing the same thing. There are now; they're just hiding it better."
 
The Mariners, Too
 The Seattle Mariners are not hiding it. Woody Woodward, their general manager, is playing McIlvaine's game, looking for ways to reduce his payroll. Their circumstances are not comparable, though.
The Mariners had a 1992 payroll of $25 million and currently stand at slightly more than $34 million. The owners want to reduce that to $32 million. The Padres had a $28 million payroll at the end of last season, total about $25.5 million now and look to drop to $21 million. To put the Padres' plight in perspective, if they had retained all of their players, they would have had a payroll totaling around $36 million, meaning their reduction is $15 million, not $7 million.
McIlvaine became the Padres' general manager in October 1990 after 10 years with the Mets.
"Before I took the job, I asked two questions," McIlvaine said, sitting in the bright sun and watching his players take batting practice. "Are you interested in winning here and are you willing to provide the funds necessary to produce a winner? Of course, the answers were affirmative. The first year that was the case. Since then, we've had to change and now we have to adjust to it."
McIlvaine tried to trade Jackson, his $2.1 million center fielder, to Boston, but the Red Sox wanted to sign the player to a multiyear contract before completing the trade and were unable to do that. The general manager has also talked with Detroit.
 
Feel Better? Good, You're Gone
 Hurst, a $3 million pitcher, would be the Padres' No. 1 starter if he were completely recovered from shoulder surgery. But as soon as he shows he is recovered -- he probably won't be able to work in a game for another week or so -- Hurst will very likely be on his way elsewhere.
Dick Freeman, the Padres' president, who was speaking for Tom Werner, the team's managing partner, said that $21 million isn't necessarily a magic number.
"We've said low 20's," Freeman said. "But we won't get down to it if it means not getting fair value for a player. We wouldn't trade him in that case. If it means we're $1 million over, it's O.K."
Ownership didn't seem to be even that flexible last October when McIlvaine was directed to trade Fernandez because the Padres didn't plan to exercise the $2.3 million option in his contract. The club had to act on the option within 48 hours after the World Series and wanted the star shortstop gone by then.
"That's been my biggest bone of contention with ownership, that I had to make that deal then," McIlvaine said. "I begged them to let me take him to the winter meetings, but they wouldn't take the risk. They were afraid because last year they wanted me to trade Santiago and I couldn't. No one wanted him. You see Florida signed him. None of the established teams wanted him."
McIlvaine traded Fernandez to the Mets, getting Wally Whitehurt, D.J. Dozier and Raul Casanova for him.
 
Wait a Minute, Says Piniella
 Most teams would like to make a trade like that with the Mariners for Randy Johnson, their No. 1 pitcher, who with his $2,625,000 salary instantly became the No. 1 trade possibility when the club's payroll problem was disclosed. But not so fast, the Mariners have said.
"I told Woody we have the makings of a good pitching rotation," Lou Piniella, Seattle's manager, said. "I have Johnson penciled in as my opening-day pitcher. It would be tough to trade a front-line pitcher. We're going to look at it and see where it would least hurt us."
Asked if he would trade a significant player, Woodward said: "I don't know yet. If we do, we'll have to get a good return. We're not giving anybody away. I've got ways I can get down without giving away players."
Like Freeman with the Padres, John Ellis, the Mariners' chief executive officer, indicated that the budget number has some flexibility. "I haven't drawn a line," Ellis said. "That would be a big mistake."
He further said he wouldn't tell the general manager what to do with the team's players.
"The management of the team is up to Woody," Ellis said. "He knows we're trying to operate within this budget area, but specifics are up to him. What we've tried to do is come up with a number that is reasonable. Clearly, it will mean a loss, but it will be a way of fulfilling a commitment to the county to have a winning team."
 
The Misgivings Mount
 When teams set out to reduce payrolls, other people wonder if they really are committed to winning. One is Donald Fehr, head of the players' union.
"It depends on how they do it," he said. "If they get down by trading, that's one thing. If they do it by releasing players, that's another. You can't make any judgments on it until after the season starts."
There is a growing perception among fans in San Diego that the Padres have placed economics first and winning a distant second.
"There are those who have been critical of us, who feel we're not committed to winning," Freeman said. "But there are others who understand the situation and are supportive."
Two of the Padres' remaining stars have mixed feelings about the situation.
"It's frustrating, because I felt we were pretty close last year," Tony Gwynn said. "If we could have kept our team intact, I think we would have been right in the thick of it. I could be negative about what has happened, but that wouldn't do any good. I'm not happy with the way things have gone the last few years, but I can understand it."
Fred McGriff echoed Gwynn, saying: "Last year we felt we were close to being able to play with the Braves. When they make all those changes, it's different. But I can't worry about the changes. It could affect my play on the field. I have to keep a positive attitude."
McGriff, however, said that the Padres' direction could influence his decision to stay or leave when his contract expires in two or three years, depending on the team's decision on his option year.
"I want to play on a winner," the first baseman said. "My goal is to get to the World Series. I don't care how I get there."
Gwynn, on the other hand, said he would be prepared to remain after his contract expires in three years.
"This is where I want to be," the right fielder said. "I'd much rather be a part of something here. I don't know what's going to happen three years down the road, but I'm going to try not to let money be a factor."
 
The Looooouuuu! Is From Valle
 Dave Valle, the Mariners' catcher, is 32 years old and has been a major leaguer for seven years. But this spring he has been taken back to his youth. Lou Piniella, his new manager, has done that.
"Of course, I remember the things he did," Valle said, recalling Piniella the player. "I was a big Yankee fan."
Valle was a junior at Holy Cross High School in Flushing, Queens, when the Yankees won the first of three consecutive pennants in 1976. Piniella, of course, was an integral member of those teams.
"He was always the guy who came up and got the big hit when they needed it," Valle said, smiling appreciatively at the recollection. "He always reminded me of a guy who played hard, kind of like a blue-collar player, diving for balls, running into walls. He was a great hitter."
Valle remains enthralled with Yankees history. "Every time I go to Yankee Stadium, I walk out to the monuments," he said. "I remember the dream of an 11-year-old kid. Joe DiMaggio was my favorite player, but I never saw him play. I've read everything there is about him."
 
Scioscia Is a Witness
 Mike Scioscia, the Los Angeles Dodgers' catcher for a dozen years, left the team when it was down, but he said, "I don't think they're as far away as people think they are." He acknowledged, though, that the Dodgers' defense will have to improve drastically for the team to improve.
"You're not going to win too many games playing that kind of defense," said Scioscia, who moved south to San Diego because he wasn't ready to serve as a backup to a young catcher. "You couldn't get a better pitching staff than we had, but the defense hurt it."
In 1992, the Dodgers committed 174 errors, an average of more than one a game and 43 more than the National League's next most porous defense, Philadelphia's. Shortstop Jose Offerman made the most errors of any National League fielder, 42. In all at short, the Dodgers committed 52 errors, the most in the league, and they also led the league with 32 errors at second base.
The Dodgers' third basemen combined for 22 errors, but that total was one less than Matt Williams made for San Francisco. Scioscia himself made nine errors, third most among catchers.
 
Old Tricks for Steinbrenner
 George Steinbrenner didn't take long to remember how to obfuscate. On his third day back as an active owner, he held a 20-minute meeting with Dick Williams at a Phoenix hotel. Asked afterward what the meeting was about, Steinbrenner said it had nothing to do with a job, that he and the long-time major league manager were old friends and they were talking baseball.
"He lives around here," the Yankees' principal owner said.
Williams, however, lives in Las Vegas, Nev. He said he was in the area visiting spring-training camps, accompanying winners of a contest sponsored by the Major League Baseball Players Alumni. He acknowledged that he had spoken with Steinbrenner about a job, but none apparently is available.

HEADLINE: Reading Reagan's Favorite Arabic Sage

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Ronald Reagan ends his Feb. 18 Op-Ed article with a quotation from the 14th-century Arab historian Ibn Khaldun, implying that Ibn Khaldun was advising that tax rates should be kept low. When President Reagan first misused Ibn Khaldun in 1981, an alert reader, Manfred Halpern, pointed out in a letter you published Oct. 11, 1981, that Ibn Khaldun was merely observing his contemporary reality. 
 Ibn Khaldun was not being prescriptive at all, but as the great social scientist he was, he was concerned not with preserving the riches of the rich, but, as Mr. Halpern pointed out, with encouraging the government to care for the poor.
This is, I fear, another instance of President Reagan's loving the anecdote more than the truth. It is a pity to see his misunderstanding appear again, uncorrected, so many years later.

HEADLINE: Reading Reagan's Favorite Arabic Sage

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Ronald Reagan, in "There They Go Again," his Feb. 18 Op-Ed response to President Clinton's economic proposal, quotes the Arab historian Ibn Khaldun. When Ibn Khaldun wrote the words (from his study of history, "The Muqaddimah") that the former President cites, he was on the periphery of government, attempting to regain an official position. 
 Ibn Khaldun's statement "At the beginning of the empire, the tax rates were low and the revenues were high. At the end of the empire, the tax rates were high and the revenues were low" leaves out an important part of Islamic economic growth.
Revenues were high at the beginning of the empire because the Arab expansion brought in enormous wealth from the civilizations they were conquering. When the conquests subsided, so did the revenues from taxation. The possible base for taxation had dwindled, and the assessments had to be increased. Also contributing to the decline in revenue was the tax break given to Muslims, that is, those who gained large revenues from the booty of conquest.
The same logic applies today. If tax breaks are given to those who gained the booty, the only way to increase revenue is to increase taxes on those possessing less. If we continue with Mr. Reagan's source, "eventually the taxes will weigh heavily on the subjects and overburden them."
This is our state of affairs. To reach this point, someone must have been levying the taxes that overburdened the subjects before President Clinton.
I can offer Mr. Reagan one more quotation from his source to aid in his search for that someone: "Prejudice and partisanship obscure the critical faculty and preclude critical investigation."

HEADLINE: Why Doesn't Gaffney Act to Preserve Water?

 BODY:
When are we going to elect a Suffolk County Supervisor who really understands the connection between sound economic development on Long Island and the safety of our ground water? Robert J. Gaffney is supporting efforts by certain shortsighted business groups to gut Article 7 of our County Health Code, praised nationally as a model safeguard for areas that depend solely on underground aquifers for their drinking water.
He wants to take away the only legal protection we have left to keep industry from warehousing dangerously large amounts of toxic chemicals on top of Suffolk's Special Ground Water Protection Areas. This includes (coincidentally?) the one in Melville, where Parr Development would like to build a facility for the Olympus Corporation, which would be permitted to store photographic chemicals at its site. 
 Does Mr. Gaffney still not understand that Long Island's drinking water lies under our feet? We don't have it piped in from some upstate reservoir like New York City does. It is sheer insanity to increase the risk of industry's spilling poisonous substances into our deep ground-water recharge areas.
Now we must count on Suffolk Health Commissioner Mary Hibbard to block Mr. Gaffney and his tunnel vision, jobs-at-any-cost supporters from weakening Article 7. We need a County Executive who really understands what we must have for sustainable growth, and completely assured safe water is basic to this. Who will pay the millions of dollars to clean up accidental spills into our aquifer? Our aquifer experts don't even know if it's possible to do it for any amount of money -- like trying to put toothpaste back in the tube!
At this moment there are 92 federally designated toxic-waste sites here in Suffolk County alone, waiting (seemingly forever) to be cleaned up. Hundreds of others of less severity dot the maps in our county health department. It is doubtful if more such evidence will persuade many Long Island industries to stop their penny-wise-and-pound-foolish development approach to business. Weakening Article 7 regulations will only make an already dangerous situation even worse.

HEADLINE: For New Haven, No More Macy's. Maybe No More Hockey.

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

 BODY:
When the New Haven Nighthawks minor league hockey team was faced with the prospect of being moved to another city at the end of the 1986-87 season, the chairman of the team's advisory board, developer Joel Schiavone, decided on a flamboyant, attention-grabbing gesture in an effort to save the franchise.
For one full week in April, Mr. Schiavone, a former owner of the American Hockey League club, camped out on the roof of the Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Wearing a Nighthawks' jacket and sleeping in a small plywood shack, Mr. Schiavone left his aerie only after the Nighthawks were able to guarantee the sale of 1,300 season tickets for the 1987-88 season. As a result, the Nighthawks' parent club, the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League, allowed the local ownership to keep the team in New Haven. 
 For a while last summer, after the team had drawn poorly at the gate under a new owner and playing without an affiliation to a major league team, it appeared once more that the state was going to lose its only minor league hockey team. But in an 11th-hour drive to sell at least 450 tickets within 48 hours, the club sold 497, largely because of the efforts of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce.
Now, though, it appears that nothing can save the franchise, which appears certain to move to somewhere in eastern Canada next season. That would leave New Haven without a professional hockey team for the first time since 1971 and put an end to 48 consecutive years of minor league hockey in the city. It also would leave Connecticut with only two professional sports teams -- the Hartford Whalers of the National Hockey League, who many insiders believe may soon leave the state because of dwindling attendance, and the New Britain Red Sox, the Double-A farm club of the Boston Red Sox. (Another Double-A baseball team, the New Haven Ravens, is scheduled to start playing at Yale Field in New Haven in the spring of 1994).
 
Move to Canada Expected
 Citing poor attendance as a major factor, Peter Shipman, a businessman who has owned the New Haven team for two seasons, recently sold the club to the Ottawa Senators, and the now New Haven Senators serve as the main farm team for the Canadian club.
In a recent interview, Randy Sexton, president of the Ottawa club, which is in its first season in the National Hockey League, indicated it was virtually certain that the franchise would be moved to Canada. "The odds are strongly in favor of not being in New Haven next season," Mr. Sexton said.
"Because of the currency exchange, it costs us much more to keep a team in the States. The other major reasons are attendance and logistics."
Logistics was also a problem with the New Haven franchise's previous parent club, the Los Angeles Kings, which had been affiliated with New Haven from 1980 until 1991. By contrast, the team -- known as the Nighthawks from 1972 until this season -- had fared much better in attendance during previous affiliations with, first, the New York Islanders, and later the New York Rangers.
"Local fans have a hard time relating to a team affiliated with Los Angeles or Ottawa," said Harmon Corey of Branford, a longtime season ticket holder for minor league hockey games in New Haven. "It was much easier relating to the Rangers because you could follow young players when they went up to the N.H.L. or were sent back to New Haven for a while."
In those days, as Mr. Corey pointed out, the Nighthawks also drew fans from New York who were unable to buy tickets for the Rangers' games at Madison Square Garden. That situation has not applied in recent years, since there are relatively few Los Angeles or Ottawa fans in the New York metropolitan area.
 
Perceptions of Unsafe Downtown
 Mr. Shipman, who has homes in Rye, N.Y., and in Branford, said he believed that "fear of the city" had kept attendance down at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum. "I think there's a perception of downtown New Haven as being unsafe, and that has kept people away," he said in an interview.
Indeed, the decline of New Haven was made more evident last week when Macy's announced it was closing its downtown store.
But Mr. Corey and some other faithful fans attribute the poor attendance to a bad team, which has been in last place for most of the season in the Northern Division of the American Hockey League, which is regarded as the primary minor league in professional hockey.
"We all expected a bad season, since it's an expansion team's farm club, but they haven't done anything to improve the team," said Tom Bauer, a season ticket holder from Middletown. "If they had made an effort to sign some free agents who played for New Haven last season and were among the team's best players and were available, they could have had a better team."
Attendance at New Haven Senators' games has been averaging about 1,785, the lowest in the American Hockey League, where the average is around 4,000. It is also the lowest since New Haven returned to the league in 1972. Attendance peaked during the first season at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum when the team, then the New Haven Nighthawks, averaged 4,914 fans a game. Those were glory days for the franchise, which was then the top minor league affiliate of the New York Islanders and included such prospects as Bobby Nystrom, who developed into an all-star right wing in the National Hockey League.
 
Coliseum's Main Tenant
 As recently as five seasons ago, New Haven was averaging more than 3,000 fans in the Coliseum, which seats 5,636 for hockey and up to 10,500 for a rock concert. But attendance fell to an all-time low of 2,683 last season, which was still about 900 more than this season.
The loss of the hockey team would be a severe blow to the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, where the team has been the main tenant since the building opened in 1972. On average, the team plays about 40 home games from October through early April and pays a rental fee of $2,900 a game. Those games account for about 30 percent of the bookings at the Coliseum, which is situated close to Interstates 95 and 91 and within walking distance of Union Station.
"If we lose the hockey team, it will have an emotional effect and it will hurt financially," said James E. Perillo, the Coliseum's executive director. "But it will enable us to do more weekend convention business, since the team plays at home on Fridays and Sundays."
It is highly unlikely, though, that the Coliseum will fill all of the hockey team's dates at a time when it has been steadily losing business. After averaging about 200 bookings a year, the Coliseum has only 145 dates booked this year, including the Senators' games. "That's an all-time low for us, and I think it's because of economic factors," Mr. Perillo said. "For example, concert business is down considerably, not just here, but all over. We used to do anywhere from 22 to 25 concerts a year; this year, we'll do from 6 to 8."
Besides professional hockey and an occasional rock concert, the Coliseum's main attractions have been, and still are, the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, the Ice Capades, Disney on Ice, occasional wrestling cards and tractor pulls and an annual appearance by the Harlem Globetrotters.
 
In Need of Repairs
 Though the Coliseum is owned by the city, which is obliged to pay the existing debt service, it is self-sustaining and, over the years, has been profitable. Three years ago, the General Assembly allotted $20 million to repair the deteriorating four-story garage atop the Coliseum. But that was $3 million less than had been requested. As a result, Mr. Perillo said, not all of the necessary repairs could be accomplished. Only two of the four garages were completely repaired, and only one of the two helixes -- the entry and exit ramps -- is usable. "As a result, if we get more than 1,000 cars to an event, it's a problem," said Mr. Perillo, who has requested $5 million more from the state to complete the necessary repairs.
Mr. Shipman agreed. "The place is in bad need of a facelift," said Mr. Shipman, who owns Howe Sports Data, a statistical service based in Boston, and who is an owner of the Raleigh, N.C., Ice Caps of the East Coast Hockey League. "We thought they were going to make some improvements, but they haven't."
Mr. Shipman said that when he bought the franchise from the Los Angeles Kings in 1991, he had hoped to at least break even. "I knew that in 20 years only one owner had made a profit here, and it was a modest one," he said. "But I lost $910,000 last season and will lose money this season, although not as much. And we spent more money on marketing than any team in the league. But I think our biggest problem is that people are afraid to come into New Haven."
Bryan McGrath, the development administrator for the city, challenged that assessment. "No one has any reason to be afraid to come to the Coliseum," Mr. McGrath said. "It's an excellent facility, and it's perfectly safe. The security is very good."
 
End of an Era
 Mr. McGrath acknowledged that the loss of the hockey team would have an adverse effect on the city. "The whole notion of having a pro team helps your town," he said. "It contributes to a better impression of the city. It's a matter of image."
If the Senators do leave New Haven, it would mark the end of an era. Except for two seasons during World War II -- 1943-44 and 1944-45 -- the city has had a professional hockey team since 1936, when New Haven became one of the original members of the American Hockey League. Playing in the old New Haven Arena, the team, the New Haven Eagles, was a member of the American Hockey League until it folded early in the 1943-44 season. New Haven returned to the league as the Ramblers from 1945 until 1951. Then from 1951 until 1972 the city was represented in professional hockey by the New Haven Blades of the Eastern Hockey League.
"I'm going to miss coming into New Haven to see a hockey game," said Mr. Bauer, the season ticket holder from Middletown. "The tickets are a lot cheaper than they are at a Whalers' game ($12 for general admission compared with $17 for the Hartford Whalers), and the parking is a lot easier. And it's fun to watch young players developing. I'm sorry they're going to leave after all these years."

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
Piquant Dishes, Turquoise and Pink Decor

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
What once seemed a marathon of new Thai restaurants has slowed to a walk. The latest (and first in more than two years) to open in Fairfield County is Siam Rialto in South Norwalk.
Ensconced in a fin de siecle building that was once a theater (the Rialto), the restaurant replaces one named Old Rialto. The decor now combines light tones of Thailand with turquoise walls and turquoise-and-pink tablecloths and napkins. A small turquoise fountain bubbles away in the lower dining area, and a brick wall is hung with Thai art and photos of Thai kings. Upstairs is a balcony with additional tables. 
 Both lunch and dinner menus pay homage to many familiar Thai specialties, with several newcomers as well. New to us was wild boar basil, a three-star (for spiciest) entree of pan-fried slices of pork combined with generous slices of mushroom, red pepper strips, baby corn and thin slices of jalapeno peppers. Well-seasoned, if not as incendiary as the stars indicated, it was a fortuitous choice.
Consistency in its star system was a problem at Siam Rialto. On one visit, the member of our party who likes spicy dishes with no holds barred asked if the starred dishes were really hot. "You want them hot?" asked the waitress. "Oh, yes!" Well, so much for requests. The dishes in question were peppery, though by no means four-alarm. Another time we made no special request, yet several dishes were blazing hot.
Especially so were the three-star piquant squid (a medley of tender sauteed squid, mushrooms, onions, red and green peppers, and fresh basil) and two-star pik king shrimp (combined with string beans, green and red peppers, and pine nuts in a red-hot pepper oil sauce, edged with coconut milk) and kgang-pa (slices of beef in a green chili sauce with eggplant, asparagus and basil). What differentiates Thai food from other Asian cuisines is its juggling act of hot, sweet, sour, bitter and salty flavors. This makes almost every dish a gustatory adventure with depth, complexity and subtlety. Siam Rialto's most noticeable weakness was its lack of all three.
Four key elements of Thai cooking were missing altogether -- coriander (cilantro), ginger (galanga) and a kind of lime leaves -- or in short supply, like lemon grass, whose tangy touch was evident only in pik king shrimp. There were hints that a Chinese cook might even be at the kitchen range: the rampant use of baby corn (a local Chinese favorite) and an appetizer-like shrimp wrapped in an egg roll skin and deep-fried.
Appetizers were mostly disappointing. Satay, barbecued beef on bamboo skewers, was generous but bland, and its peanut sauce was underspiced. Golden katong -- petite flowers of crisp, fried spring roll filled with chopped shrimp, ground chicken, black mushrooms, corn, carrots and frozen peas -- was Thai in origin, but lacked fresh coriander and other spices that give zing to the classic dish.
Soups usually illuminate the balancing act of Thai cooking. But the chicken coconut soup lacked any assertive undertow and though the menu mentioned galanga, none could be tasted. Desserts at Siam Rialto are modest. Of three ice creams, coconut was superior to the green tea and too-sweet ginger.
A three-course dinner for two cost $32.50 before tip, tax and drinks. Skipping appetizers (the least successful part of the menu) would bring the price still lower. Even with three courses, this is one of the area's better values for a decidedly different meal in attractive surroundings, attended by a friendly staff. There is a full bar, an almost nonexistent wine list and several beers, including Thai Singha, our choice for a Thai meal. If it can iron out its inconsistencies and fear of flavoring, Siam Rialto has the potential to be a mainstay for budget watchers and anyone seeking an unusual dining experience.
Comings and Goings: The recession continues to be felt in Connecticut. Among recent restaurant closings are Nantucket (New Canaan), Oslo (Stamford), Thai Gardens (Cromwell) and Whitfield Alley (Guilford). In Westport, Chop Chop American Grill, Hong Kong Taste, Oriental Seaport, Fuddruckers and Le Paradis are gone, though the last reportedly may reopen under new ownership, and a fire at Onion Alley will keep it closed for repairs until July.

President Clinton, seeking to counter accusations that his Administration is more interested in spending money than in cutting the deficit, said today that his critics "lack the vision" to improve the economy.
In his weekly radio address, Mr. Clinton followed through on an offensive he began on Friday, laying out the features of a spending plan that he says will put Americans to work and insisting that these programs are still needed despite signs that jobless rates are dropping and consumer confidence is up. 
 His remarks appeared to be aimed as much at members of Congress as at weekend radio listeners. Some Democrats and many Republicans have said that the $31 billion in new spending that Mr. Clinton calls a stimulus package should be trimmed until more budget cuts can be found.
"There are those who actually lack the vision to support these investments because they say that we shouldn't spend any new money trying to grow this economy," Mr. Clinton said. "It's not that they have a plan to make the economy grow, but they just dismiss the investment portion of our program by calling it more Government spending."
 
Seeing a 'Profound Difference'
 "There is a profound difference between spending and investment," he said. "It's the difference between the status quo and change."
The White House has tried to sell its economic plan in three stages. Officials struggled first with the notion of convincing Americans that sacrifice, in the form of new taxes, would be necessary to balance the deficit. Then Mr. Clinton took to the road promoting the 150 spending cuts in his plan, pledging that he would not support any spending increase that was not accompanied by a cut.
Now, Administration officials are seeking to define good spending and bad spending. Allocating more money in roads, bridges, research and incentives for small business is investment, not spending, they insist.
"Every investment is designed to make us smarter, safer and more secure, now and in the long term," Mr. Clinton said today.
The rebounding economy has not helped Mr. Clinton make his case for economic stimulus. On Friday, the Labor Department released new statistics showing that unemployment dropped a tenth of a percent in February, the biggest jump in employees added to the nation's payrolls in four years.
But Mr. Clinton declared today that the nation's unemployment rate of 7 percent still remains higher than it was during the recession and does not reflect the number of employed Americans who are working part time or who do not receive benefits like health care.
 
Aiming at Democrats
 "If this anemic recovery is the best we can do, it's further proof that real changes are needed to produce a better economy and a better life for our people," Mr. Clinton said.
Selling Mr. Clinton's economic plan to Congress has become the chief task for the President and his advisers. In recent days, aides to the President have challenged Republican critics to come up with budget-cutting alternatives, but the aides have rejected suggestions forwarded to the White House by partisan foes like Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas.
But today's challenge appeared to be aimed at the wavering Democrats. The White House has been sending subtle warnings to the members of the President's party who have spoken out against the plan, and few have publicly denounced the plan. But the White House must also compromise with these Democrats, who have the power to derail the package.
In remarks made at a news conference with mayors on Friday, Mr. Clinton emphasized the elements of the package that will provide incentives to small business. And today, he said the Administration would announce plans next week to change regulations to make it easier for small- and medium-sized businesses to qualify for loans.
"The issue is not whether there should be more budget cuts," he said Friday. "The issue is whether under the general shield of saying we need to reduce spending, we'll step away from investment. Just because a mayor wants to do it doesn't make it wrong, doesn't make it pork, doesn't make it useless."

Seeding a Huge Project on an Old Railyard

BYLINE: By CHERYL KENT

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
MUCH of this city's Near South Side is just acres of vacant industrial land and underutilized railyards. But in 1989 developers took in hand a 72-acre tract, named it Central Station and trumpeted it as a $3 billion development that would include commerce, houses, stores, hotels and exhibition halls.
Allotments to each category would be determined by demand. Current zoning calls for a maximum of 19.5 million square feet of developed space. 
 What meets the eye four years later is a far cry from what the developers envisioned. But a residential development has started in the form of three-story town houses and apartments, with the Loop and Lake Michigan each about a half mile away. People are expected to start moving in in June.
The land developer of Central Station is Forest City Enterprises, a national real estate company based in Cleveland, in partnership with the Chicago-based Fogelson Properties. The Illinois Central Railroad sold land and air rights to the partners in 1989, retaining control only over the few active rail lines still on the property, which is named for the Illinois Central Depot, which once stood on the site.
To the developers, a key element of the future Central Station is back-office development for downtown companies. A problem is that with 26 million square feet of office space in Chicago vacant, back-office rates can be negotiated in new downtown high rises.
Nevertheless, Gerald Fogelson, chairman of Fogelson Properties, said he was still pursuing deals for large spaces with four prospective tenants. "The bad news is there are fewer deals," he said. "The good news is fewer guys are chasing them."
Other good news was that in November a builder started work on 40 town houses and 44 condominium apartments on a five-acre site. They are envisioned as the first stage in a 160-unit, $30 million development called Burnham Place. The builder is MCL, a 15-year-old Chicago development company. There have been 60 buyers so far.
The apartments will be in four L-shaped stone and brick three-story buildings on a square 2.5-acre lot, embracing two U-shaped buildings within. Apartments are 1,400 to 2,200 square feet and sell for $170,000 to $259,000. Roy H. Kruse & Associates of Chicago is the architect.
The town houses, in a similar configuration on an adjoining 2.5-acre lot, range from 2,200 to 3,400 square feet and are priced at $259,000 and $439,000. Pat Fitzgerald & Associates of Chicago is the architect.
AS a residential location, the Near South Side is relatively young. The North Side, north of the Loop, is the place of choice for many city residents, but little land is available there and development costs are comparatively high. Development in the Near South Side began when construction of Dearborn Park housing began in 1974. With the completion of its second complex within a year, there will be a total of 1,900 units.
Services for residents are still fairly scarce. The Printers' Row development, a half mile west of Burnham Place, has spawned an abundance of convenience and other service stores, but there are few supermarkets and restaurants.
The buyers at Burnham Place focused on the housing itself, however. Many said they had looked elsewhere but could not find what they wanted. Dan McLean, president of MCL, said the units were selling for about $125 a square foot, not substantially less than comparable units on the North Side, where housing of this kind is more typical.
George Cullen, one of the buyers, said he had looked for 18 months on the North Side before buying a $390,000, 3,420-square-foot town house in Burnham Place. Comparable units were hard to find to the north, he said. To him, the relative lack of services is a minor inconvenience. "The truth is we usually get in our cars and drive to a restaurant anyway," he said.
Mr. Cullen, a 57-year-old lawyer, is a lifelong South Sider. As a boy, he went to the beach at 12th Street to dive off the rocks into Lake Michigan. He said would be able to walk to that same swimming spot from his new house, this time with his five grandchildren, aged 2 to 8.
MCL plans to begin construction this summer on the 56 units that will complete the first phase of the development. It also has plans for 23 attached homes on an adjacent one-acre site, which it has an option to buy from the Central Station joint-venture partners.
Mr. McLean said many of his buyers -- like the Cullens -- are couples with adult children. Others are young professional couples without children; 30 percent of the total are single professional women. One problem that may deter couples with children is the lack of reputable schools in the area.
SCOTT FROMM, a 37-year-old, single divorce lawyer who bought an apartment in Burnham Place after a year-long search for a new home, said he cared little about the lack of service stores and shopping.
"I'm very mobile," he said. "I cook on average once a month and I shop maybe four times per year."
He sees the possibility of higher-than-average appreciation in the value of his 2,200-square-foot unit with garage for which he paid $259,000 with $17,000 in upgrades. And, he said, he was strongly motivated by mortgage interest rates, currently a shade under 8 percent.
Mr. McLean left investment banking 15 years ago to begin his career as a developer, starting out with renovations and moving to new construction. He has made something of a speciality of buying underutilized urban industrial land and building town houses. His first such project, in 1985, was Lakewood Commons on the North Side, with 108 town houses stretching along three blocks occupied by the Lincoln Towing Company before its bankruptcy. Four similar projects followed, one with 124 units in Dearborn Park.
In all, Mr. McLean has built 515 homes in Chicago since 1985.
GREG LONGHINI of Chicago's Department of Planning and Economic Development said the city was trying to focus development on the Near South Side, and it has shown its interest with the issuance of $4.5 million in tax-free bonds toward construction of Central Station's infrastructure, including sewer lines, roads, and landscaping.
In addition, the city has agreed to issue an additional $36 million in bonds over 22 years for infrastructure as the Central Station project proceeds. Buyers of the bonds will be reimbursed from property taxes paid on the site. For their part, the Central Station developers have paid more than $10 million toward the improvements.

HEADLINE: A Bowling Film Shatters Illusions

BYLINE: By MARJORIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
"WHEN you hear thunder, God is bowling," is how a new seriocomic thriller, "Spare Me," by Matthew Harrison, begins.
The audience is confronted by a dark and twisted story, and initially wonders whether to laugh or cry. 
 Mr. Harrison, 33, who once lived in Bay Shore and now lives in New York City, practices what Preston Sturges once recommended, "Make it strange."
"Spare Me," Mr. Harrison's first full-length feature, is a faintly tongue-in-cheek played-straight sendup of a post-World War II film noir, the style and attitude characterized by a dark melodrama of crime, corruption and disordered psyches.
 
Drawing on Film History
 Christopher Cooke, director of the Suffolk Film Bureau in Hauppauge and co-producer of "Spare Me,' said a return to film noir, along with other genres, may be just another way for independent film makers to draw on history in an effort to return to basics. Another way, Mr. Cooke said, is forming film cooperatives to "network" and cut production costs.
In 1985, Mr. Harrison founded Film Crash in Manhattan, an informal collective that Christopher Grimm once of Ocean Bay Park and co-writer of "Spare Me," has described as "like gangs of director-driven film makers who help each other out instead of fighting."
Film Crash has developed into a philosophy and model for other groups of independents in Suffolk.
Especially among young film makers, low-budget movies created out of pooled resources are like returning from designer to work clothes, Mr. Harrison said. "Spare Me," filmed in 18 days on a $38,000 budget, substituted ingenuity for capital, with Robert Moses State Park and a bowling alley in Mineola helping to maintain the small budget.
 
A 'Social Experience'
 "Spare Me" was screened at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington last month, and it has been accepted for the Sao Paulo International Film Festival in Brazil. On Thursday the film makes its Long Island debut at 8 P.M. at the New York Institute of Technology in Central Islip.
"In 'Spare Me' bowling becomes the 'Paradise Lost' of the American optimism and vitality of the 50's and 60's," Mr. Grimm said. "The postcynical 90's is a time for returning to working-class values and traditions like bowling. The low-tech, yet highly social experience of rolling a big black ball down a perfectly polished lane at 10 symmetrical white pins might just symbolize the new world order."
Mr. Grimm, who attended the State University at Purchase and Brown University, said he learned film making the blue-collar way -- by doing.
"This gives our films a different feel than those coming out of the film schools," he said. "The advantage is a fresh foundation and approach."
Mr. Harrison said "Spare Me" had been modeled after "Repo Man," a nightmarish black fantasy made in 1984 by Alex Cox. Highly stylized in writing, acting and technique, the images and symbolism are purposely abstract and intense, with rapid cuts.
In "Spare Me," a "down and dirty" film dealing with fractured relationships, a "bad boy of bowling" starts a crusade to find his lost father while falling in love with a pyromaniac waitress and cyclist whose brother has escaped from a mental institution.
 
The Sport's Toughest Shot
 Bowling metaphors like the "mixer ball" and the "7-10 split," the hardest shot in the game, are common in the film. "The protagonist is faced with one of those impossible 7-10 splits of life," Mr. Harrison said. "Bowling is like faith. Now and then it ends up in the gutter."
"Spare Me" is based on an incident in a bowling alley where Mr. Harrison learned about the intensity and passion of the sport. "It may be a product of where I am economically, and also where our society is at," he said. "But I think we are partly in a revisionist period returning to working-class values."
According to Mr. Harrison, the bowling industry provides a built-in audience. The American Bowling Congress said 82 million people bowled in 1991l. On Long Island, the A.B.C. lists 58 bowling centers and more than 55,000 registered league bowlers. The organization says the Island has 27,000 female bowlers and 28,000 male participants. Although the target audience for "Spare Me" is college students, Mr. Harrison hinted at a potential mass appeal similar to that of the "Rocky Horror Picture Show."
Mr. Harrison and Mr. Grimm, friends since childhood, have tried to demystify movies as a costly and imposing process.
"We're filling a gap for struggling independent film makers left by museums, festivals and repertories," Mr. Harrison said. "The main focus of Film Crash has been creating our own audience. We started organizing screenings with a party angle to show our own Super-8 shorts on a regular basis and encouraged audience feedback."
What began as a celebration of their films on the Lower East Side, at sites like Public School 122 and projections on a brick wall for an audience seated in a restaurant, has progressed to screenings at the Angelika Film Center at 18 West Houston Street, as well as in Los Angeles.
"At first to attract people, we encouraged anything with sprocket holes," Mr. Harrison said. "But now we've had to turn people away. Our criteria is limited to film makers beginning to find their own voice. We're not interested in looking slick or showing resume films. We can show our films and then get on to making the next one."
For Mr. Harrison, that includes more than 50 shorts, including an underground hit in 1989, "Bonehead."
Mr. Harrison was born in Manhattan, the son of a graphic designer. At 9, he made a two-minute black-and-white movie about a corrupt detective that was filmed at 14th Street and Ninth Avenue. Summers on Fire Island brought together Mr. Harrison as director, Mr. Grimm as screenwriter and Danny Brenner as composer in the ultraviolent "Kiddie Massacre."
"We used to show our films at the firehouse in Ocean Bay Park," said Mr. Harrison, a graduate of the Cooper Union School of Art. For more than 20 years he has continued to make films with his friends, who, with members of his family, helped finance "Spare Me."
 
Lured by 'Splatter' Films
 While growing up, Mr. Harrison was attracted to genre movies, especially the violent and slow-motion "splatter" films directed by Sam Peckinpah like "Straw Dogs." Most of those films were "revisionist westerns," Mr. Harrison said, in that they no longer had the classic western heroes who wore black or white hats but, instead, led the way for the antihero movement of the 70's.
Mr. Harrison agrees with Alfred Hitchcock, who said, "Films should be stronger than reason." His own philosophy for making movies follows Francis Ford Coppola, who said, "Just start marching down the avenue with a flag, and pretty soon you'll have a whole parade behind you."
