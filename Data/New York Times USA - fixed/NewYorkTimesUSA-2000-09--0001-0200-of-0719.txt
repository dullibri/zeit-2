HEADLINE: CABARET GUIDE

 BODY:
A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.
QUEEN ESTHER, Joe's Pub, Papp Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. This artist exudes an impish charm that recalls the sorely missed comedian and performance artist Danitra Vance. But by the end of the show her musical identity remains undefined. Her nondescript versions of "The Lady Is a Tramp" and "Lush Life" fail to illuminate either the material or her ideas. And when she caps her show with two more vintage lounge songs, "I've Gotta Be Me" and "The Good Life," it isn't clear whether she's making fun of them or embracing them. The best moments of her show, "Unemployed Superstar," are its nonmusical monologues in which Queen Esther impersonates embittered neighbors she met when she moved to Harlem. Characters like these could form the basis of an unsettling evening of serious political comedy. Tonight and next Friday at 8:30. Tickets: $12 (Stephen Holden). 
 * "OUR SINATRA," Reprise Room at Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes, which focuses on what Mr. Comstock calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, whose creamy baritone echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock concentrates on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves that there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Tonight and Monday through Wednesday nights at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sunday night at 7:30. Tickets: $50 and $55; premium ringside seating, $75 and $80 (Holden).
MARC SALEM, Feinstein's, at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. Marc Salem is the mental magician who dazzled audiences at the Westside Theater with his 1997 show, "Mind Games." Now Mr. Salem, accompanied by a trio of bass, piano and percussion, is in residence at Feinstein's with "Mind Games and All That Jazz." But handsome as it is, Feinstein's at the Regency may not be the ideal setting for the display of Mr. Salem's enjoyable bag of tricks. The intimacy of Feinstein's, where Mr. Salem seems to be working with a smaller palette than at the Westside Theater, detracts from the aura of magic that can surround, say, a wristwatch that suddenly changes the time it displays. The jazz trio Vibrations, as pleasant and talented as it is, provides little more than a few attractive introductory numbers and a bit of musical commentary of the "Twilight Zone" sort. Nevertheless, Mr. Salem and his wizardry provide cool fun for hot summer nights. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11. Cover: $40 on weekends; no cover on weekdays; dinner required for early show on weekends, with seating beginning at 6; a la carte supper menu with $20 minimum for late show; $35 for early show; Sunday brunch is $30 and cover is $30. Through Sept. 9 (Lawrence Van Gelder).
ARCI'S PLACE, 450 Park Avenue South, at 30th Street, (212) 532-4370. Christiane Noll, singer, in an evening of jazz, with David Budway, pianist. Tonight at 9; tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11. Cover: $25; $15 minimum. Karen Mason begins Wednesday, through Oct. 15.

CARNEGIE CLUB, 156 West 56th Street, (212) 957-9676. Cary Hoffman, with the 11-piece Carnegie Club Orchestra, plays music made famous by Frank Sinatra in the 1950's, featuring the original arrangements by Nelson Riddle. Friday and Saturday nights at 9:30 and 11. Cover, $20; two-drink ($15) minimum.

HEADLINE: WEEKEND EXCURSION;
Retracing the Steps Trod at Gettysburg

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM 

DATELINE: GETTYSBURG, Pa.

 BODY:
The National Park Service recommends on its Web site that visitors to the Gettysburg National Military Park spend at least four hours touring the battlefield and museum, "though an entire day is more desirable."
As understatements go, this is a keeper. You could spend a lifetime here and never outlast the topic or the topography. But a weekend excursion to this 6,000-acre shrine is a start. It can help to explain why Civil War buffs are so ardent, why veterans of more recent wars come here as if to communion and why historians, novelists and filmmakers can't leave Gettysburg alone. 
 Until you have walked the stone walls and trekked the woods along Seminary Ridge (the Rebels' line before their final infantry assault) and then switched sides to gaze back across the fields from Little Round Top (the fabled knob of stone-strewn Union high ground), you cannot truly understand what happened here from July 1 to 3, 1863. The best books on the subject are merely informed preparation. You must bring your imagination and suspend your disbelief. Because no one can explain, really, why 170,000 men from Maine to Mississippi -- men who only two years before had claimed common citizenship -- came here to kill one another.
Yet they did, and the history they made is worth at least one sunny summer day 137 years later.
My 14-year-old son, Alec, and I made the trip together. By car from the New York area, it's a smooth four-and-a-half-hour drive along the New Jersey and Pennsylvania Turnpikes, about 210 miles.
Our plan was to arrive in midafternoon on a Friday and spend all day Saturday and Sunday morning at the park.
Both of us brushed up on history before we set out, but I was more manic.
I bought several hour-by-hour guides to the battle, consulted Shelby Foote's multivolume "Civil War" (Random House, 1963) and scoured the library for books that profiled commanders and analyzed strategy.
 
A Compelling Novel
The best book of all turned out not to be a history book but a novel that many people had recommended as both good reading and good history: Michael Shaara's "Killer Angels," which won a Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Shaara personalizes the battle, which he presents and analyzes through imagined thoughts and conversations. In the novel, Gen. Robert E. Lee and Gen. James Longstreet are at odds over Lee's plan to take the battle to the Union lines. Gen. John Buford, a cavalry officer, is the first to skirmish with the Confederates on July 1. Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, commander of the 20th Maine Volunteers, saw some of the most desperate fighting of the battle on the second and third days.
But first a disclaimer. I had never been a Civil War buff.
Perhaps it was the misleading name: Civil War, a flagrant contradiction. It was more likely, though, that I had been numbed by the perpetual tape loop of my childhood social studies curriculum. It unwound each September with Columbus's voyage to the New World and halted abruptly each June just shy of James Buchanan's inauguration. In junior high school we touched on the Missouri Compromise, Fort Sumter and John Brown. Grant drank, we learned, and Lee's horse was named Traveller. We memorized the Gettysburg Address. History as film strip.
 
A Dysfunctional Country
Then one day, long after college and in pursuit of self-education, I picked up "This Hallowed Ground," Bruce Catton's highly regarded one-volume account of the war. I was hooked on the concept: a dysfunctional young country -- a vague cohort of adolescent jurisdictions calling itself the United States -- tears itself apart, creating heros and villains and gory legends at every turn.
In a blood feud between two starkly different cultures, one slave, one free, place names pop up like so many tombstones in a family plot: Bull Run, Fredericksburg, Antietam, Vicksburg. A rancorous social and political drama played out in the dangerous confusion of 19th-century warfare -- a war waged by gentlemanly generals, North and South, many of whom attended West Point together in the 1830's and 40's.
In all of this, Gettysburg stands out, and not just for its ruthlessness. Mistakes were made here, some in the name of glory. But it was the beginning of the end for the Confederacy, the so-called High Water Mark, that ended with the repulse of Gen. George E. Pickett's charge against the center of the Union line on the third day. It was, too, a crushing and bitter defeat for Lee, for whom Gettysburg was the second and final incursion north of the Mason-Dixon line. (The first resulted in the bloody battle at Sharpsburg, Md., in September 1862.)
At the time the two armies came upon it, Gettysburg was a market town of 2,000, a quiet crossroads whose dusty pikes led to the state capital, at Harrisburg, as well as to Carlisle, Chambersburg and York. It was home to a Lutheran seminary and Pennsylvania (later Gettysburg) College. Nothing much happened here until, by chance, the Army of the Potomac, under Gen. George G. Meade, and the Army of Northern Virginia, under Lee, caught wind of each other.
They had last engaged in Chancellorsville, Va., at the start of May, when Lee's army, outnumbered 2 to 1, had brilliantly outmaneuvered the Yankees under the feckless command of Gen. Joseph Hooker.
Emboldened, Lee and the Confederate Government in Richmond had decided to shadow the Yankees, now under Meade's command, as they made their way back north through Virginia and Maryland and into Pennsylvania. This second invasion of the North, the Southerners hoped, would permit Lee to cut off Meade from Washington, forcing Abraham Lincoln to recognize the Confederate States of America.
That didn't happen. On July 4, 1863, after three days of fighting, Lee's army pulled back and headed south. More than 51,000 soldiers on both sides had been killed, wounded or captured.
 
Defined by Battle
Were it not for the battlefied, which surrounds and includes the town itself, Gettysburg would still be the same quiet hamlet it was in the middle of the 19th century. Today, with a population of 7,000 and a tourist influx of 1.5 million a year, it is an antique stage set for restaurants, pubs and souvenir shops of all kinds.
There's a wax museum, a Hall of Presidents and a business that offers tours of "haunted Gettysburg." The Gettysburg Address is reproduced on plaques, brochures and dinner menus. You can visit the home of Jennie Wade, the only civilian killed during the battle; she was shot through the door of her house by a Louisiana marksman as she baked biscuits for Union soldiers.
But the battlefield, in its scope and the bountiful greens and tans of summer, is a serious monument, and the Park Service treats it as such.
You can of course go to Gettysburg unschooled: with just two brochures, offered free at the visitor center, the war and the battleground become instantly accessible. A foldout map pinpoints all the significant skirmish and battle lines. It includes a 16-point self-guided auto tour, a synopsis of the fighting and diagrams of troop positions on each day. The other pamphlet, "Planning Your Visit," is a schedule of daily educational programs offered by park rangers, who know their stuff. Their spiels tend to be as entertaining as they are informative.
 
Hallowed Ground
On the Sunday we were there, Matt Atkinson, a ranger from Mississippi, conducted a 35-minute tour of the National Cemetery, which Lincoln dedicated on Nov. 19, 1863, four months after the battle.
"Most of you probably had to memorize the Gettysburg Address," he said, speaking to a gathering largely made up of Northerners. "That wasn't a priority where I came from." Pause for laughter. "Just kidding," he added quickly.
For our full day at the park, Alec and I bought an auto-tour tape cassette for $10 that includes yet another map of the battlefield. Road signs with stars on them clearly mark the route.
It's almost impossible to get lost. But I had a habit of listening so intently to the narration that I stopped either too soon or too late. Often Alec caught me pointing to what I thought was the famous Peach Orchard or McPherson's Barn when actually I had parked at Stop 4 and not Stop 5.
"This is what it must have been like following some general around," Alec said. "And he didn't have a tape."
Fair enough. So a suggestion: before you take the tour, stop at the visitor center, tour the museum of relics -- guns, bugles, cannons, uniforms -- and go to the electric map. For $3 you'll see a room-size relief map with blinking lights and hear a 30-minute narration that allows you to get a sense of the park and the battle.
Interesting but less important, perhaps, is the cyclorama of the final day's assault, the charge led by Pickett at Lee's orders: 12,000 men walked a mile toward the heavily fortified center of the Union line; fewer than half came back. The 360-degree painting, housed in its own specially designed building, was completed in 1883 by a French artist, Paul Philippoteaux, whose work was all the rage at the end of the 19th century.
By 5 p.m. on Friday, having viewed the map and grabbed some brochures, Alec and I headed to our weekend retreat, the Battlefield Bed and Breakfast Inn, a five-minute drive on Route 15 at the southern edge of the park. A large comfortable old farmhouse (the original structure dates to 1809), it is really just a disguised theme park for its owners, Charles and Florence Tarbox.
Charlie Tarbox, 52, is a plump, loquacious and utterly engaging criminal defense lawyer from California who retired from the courtroom to pursue his undergraduate love: military history.
"The Civil War," he likes to say, "is the world's longest-running soap opera."
In 1994, after a year of construction, the Tarboxes opened the former sheep and dairy farm as an inn on Memorial Day weekend. The rooms are comfortable, the surroundings (46 acres, a horse barn and a passel of feral outdoor cats) bucolic and the breakfasts as good as they look. But the treat is Mr. Tarbox, who lectures each morning from 8 to 9, before breakfast.
He has 15 programs on the war: the cavalry, the artillery, the soldiers' lives. On Saturday morning he was AWOL, but an able substitute, Bill Pulig, a podiatrist at the United States Army War College in nearby Carlisle, stood in for him.
 
'It Got Pretty Hot'
About 15 guests occupied plastic lawn chairs on a gravel patio outside the inn's dining room, sun breaking through, grass still dewy. Mr. Pulig, who is also a Civil War re-enactor, stood before us in a cavalry trooper's uniform, but with only the collar button buttoned. "Regulations," he said. "The uniforms were made of wool and it got pretty hot. Nevertheless the generals wanted the buttons buttoned."
Apparently the Army has always been the Army. It insisted on uniformity at the collar but failed to mention the rest of the jacket, so most overheated soldiers left the other buttons undone.
Mr. Pulig had plenty of props, including a saddle and a trooper's belt with sword, holster and sidearm. The trooper also carried a carbine: basically a rifle with a short barrel that was effective only at close range but had the advantage, for the horse, of not being long enough to swat its ears.
Props need actors, and Mr. Pulig quickly pulled from his audience the most likely helper, Laura Dietrick, 11. She had come with her parents, Dave and Jeanne, and her sister, Amy, 6, from Nazareth, Pa., near Allentown, to see the sights. Suddenly she had become one.
By the time Mr. Pulig was through, Laura was swathed in a trooper's jacket, a hat, a greatcoat and much more. Mr. Pulig told her she would receive a daily ration of 13 hardtack crackers (basically kindergarten paste) and enough beans to make six pints of coffee.
So much for the romance of soldiering.
"Most of the stuff you see in the John Wayne movies is totally inaccurate," Mr. Pulig said, debunking the notion that a trooper could fire 8, 10 or 20 pistol rounds without reloading or stopping to fit caps to miniballs.
Among his more interesting anecdotes: the Union army trained tens of thousands of horses for its cavalry, but training meant simply that a horse could stand to have a saddle and a rider on its back. A federal trooper would still have to train the horse to be ridden in battle.
The Rebel cavalry, he said, was often better prepared because horse and rider knew each other well.
"In the Confederate Army, you showed up with your own horse," Mr. Pulig said. "Otherwise you'd be in the infantry."
 
Canon of Cannons
On our second morning at the inn, Charlie Tarbox appeared, with mutton-chop whiskers and garbed in a tattered Union uniform. He had a full house, almost 20 boarders. We sat with fresh coffee and orange juice. Mr. Tarbox explained artillery.
Cannons are everywhere on the battlefield. They all look the same: iron or bronze barrels resting on two large wooden wheels. Basically metal tubes to propel solid iron balls.
Not that simple, it turns out. Mr. Tarbox, who performs with the zeal of a patent-medicine pitchman, described in layman's terms how 12-pound cannonballs that once landed with a thud, possibly injuring just one infantry soldier, eventually became high-velocity rocks, skipping like stones, hitting one man, then another, then another.
The record for one cannonball, he said, was 32 soldiers at the Battle of Zorndorf in 1757, when Prussian and Russian troops clashed.
A typical Tarbox observation: the romance of war suddenly soured by reality.
This came through time and again on the tour. Once you see the wide-open pasture that Pickett's men had to cross, moving without cover toward the Union redoubts above them, romance seems an alien concept.
Maybe it's the contradictions of Gettysburg that continue to keep people in thrall. Pointless death, but death with honor. Evidence comes from the soldiers themselves, quoted in "Guide to the Battle of Gettysburg," edited by Jay Luvaas and Harold W. Nelson. In his after-action report, Maj. Charles S. Peyton, Ninth Virginia Infantry, commanding Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett's brigade in Pickett's division, wrote:
"The brigade went into action with 1,287 men and about 140 officers . . . sustained a loss of . . . 941 killed, wounded, and missing. . . . Never had the brigade been better handled and never has it done better service in the field of battle. There was scarcely an officer or man in the command whose attention was not attracted by the cool and handsome bearing of General Garnett, who, totally devoid of excitement or rashness, rode immediately in rear of his advancing line, endeavoring by his personal efforts, and by the aid of his staff, to keep his line well closed and dressed. He was shot from his horse while near the center of the brigade, within about 25 paces of the stone wall."

 BODY:
The service economy has created some strange and wonderful forms of employment. A friend of mine once went to a party in Los Angeles where the host had covered one room with fuzzy shag carpet -- floor, walls and ceiling -- and hired a man whose sole job was to fluff up the nap whenever it got matted. "Survivor" drove home the lesson that farmers and truck drivers are no match for people with titles like "corporate trainer" or "whitewater rafter." At the Democratic convention, thanks to the presence of Christie Brinkley in the New York delegation, we were alerted for the first time to the existence of a career path known as "model/activist."
Until recently, America chose its presidents pretty exclusively from the national pool of lawyers and generals. But lately the candidates' backgrounds have gotten more varied. 
 This year, of the Democrats and Republicans on the national tickets, only Joe Lieberman is a lawyer, and only Al Gore was ever a full-time soldier.
It's never been clear how much voters care if a president's experience with the world of work in any way resembles their own. Do weary parents juggling two careers and child-rearing resent hearing about George W. Bush's afternoon naps? Would middle-aged professionals who are too humiliated to admit they don't know the difference between a money market and a mutual fund feel an affinity for Al Gore, who keeps his savings in a passbook account?
Both Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, are rich men, while Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman are not. Economically speaking, Mr. Gore may actually be downwardly mobile. He says he doesn't buy stock because it might look like a conflict of interest, and Fortune magazine, analyzing what passes for the Gore portfolio, once suggested the vice president "could be a financial dolt."
So which team better understands the working stiff? The Democratic candidates are less wealthy, but on the other hand, they're both career politicians who have held elective office practically since puberty. (Mr. Lieberman did have a two-year hiatus after he lost a House race in 1980, during which he worked as a lawyer and represented at least one client in the liquor industry who had issues before the Connecticut state legislature. The senator's staff says this doesn't mean he used to be a lobbyist, but the experience probably gave Mr. Lieberman a certain sympathy for the trials of a carpet-fluffer. )
Mr. Bush, who was about as successful at drilling oil wells as Mr. Gore is in investing, struck it rich when he persuaded a group of wealthy associates to help him buy the Texas Rangers and then persuaded the town of Arlington to build said team a new stadium. Mr. Bush's own $600,000 investment thus became $14.9 million when the franchise was sold. The work he performed as the managing general partner included encouraging team spirit, and reportedly involved a lot of autograph-signing. This may not have given him much in common with the nation's stevedores, but Ms. Brinkley and the other model/activists of the world undoubtedly know what he's been through.
Mr. Cheney spent most of his career in government, but the arrival of the Clinton administration left him cooling his heels at a conservative think tank. Happily, in 1995 he went salmon fishing with Thomas Cruikshank, chairman of the Halliburton Company, a huge energy services business, who liked Mr. Cheney so much he recommended him as his successor, at a salary of more than $1 million a year and oodles of stock options. During his tenure there, the future vice-presidential candidate's big coup was a merger with the company's chief rival, Dresser Industries, whose chief executive Mr. Cheney won over during a quail hunt.
Mr. Cheney's ability to fish and shoot his way to serious money should be an inspiration to all careerists who worry that an inability to play golf is standing between them and success. Sure, there were some failures at Halliburton, including the time his company was banned from bidding on road construction contracts by the state of North Carolina. But they might provide a much-needed humanizing touch. We've all had our little career setbacks. Getting tossed out of North Carolina might not be one of them, but the concept is there.
Happy Labor Day weekend. Buy a steelworker a drink.

Plan to Cut Trading Costs at 2 Key European Exchanges

BYLINE: By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
In a move intended to shore up support for the planned merger of the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges, the clearinghouses for the two markets introduced a plan today that would cut settlement costs by 90 percent for certain trades.
Brokers have expressed concern about the potential for escalating costs should the London and Frankfurt exchanges combine to form a pan-European bourse called iX. Winning the support of brokers is crucial for the London Stock Exchange in its attempts to ward off a hostile bid from OM Gruppen A.B., the Swedish company that runs the Stockholm stock exchange. 
 "It's a good workable blueprint," said Brian Mairs, a spokesman for the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers.
While today's proposal went a long way toward addressing shareholder concerns, questions about how the savings would be achieved and who would benefit the most underscore the difficulty that European stock exchanges were facing as they tried folding dissimilar technologies and regulations into one entity. A certain amount of overlap in terms of how trades are settled has led some shareholders of the London Stock Exchange to call the proposal a political Band-Aid, rather than the most economically viable solution.
Furthermore, since the plan laid out by the London settlement firm, CrestCo, and its Frankfurt counterpart, Clearstream, is not contingent upon the formation of iX, it remains unclear how effective the measures will be in warding off the Swedish bid. CrestCo has said that it will work with whichever partner London exchange shareholders choose.
"This can go ahead without iX," Don Cruickshank, the chairman of the London Stock Exchange, said today at a news conference.
Under the plan, which could be introduced by next summer, the cost of domestic trades will remain constant, while the price of cross-border trades could fall by as much as 90 percent. Transaction costs for trading pan-European stocks are more than 10 times those for trading stocks in the United States, according to an estimate by Merrill Lynch.
Only trades made through a so-called central counterparty, a kind of clearinghouse system intended to allow institutional investors to remain anonymous in trades, will be subject to the savings. Since most retail brokers do not use such a system, it is unclear how much they will benefit.
Institutional investors accounted for most international trades last year on the London exchange, which amounted to £2.4 trillion, or $3.48 trillion, compared with £1.4 trillion, or $2.03 trillion, for domestic trades.
"In essence this is good news," said Michael Clark, a director of the British brokerage house Charles & Stanley & Company, which owns 100,000 shares of the London Stock Exchange. "What bearing it has on a decision regarding iX, I'm not sure."

HEADLINE: July Manufacturing Orders Dropped 7.5%, a Record

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Orders placed with manufacturers fell 7.5 percent in July, the largest drop on record, and private survey data from the Midwest suggested a further slowdown ahead.
"The economy is headed toward a significant slowdown in growth," said Kenneth Mayland, president of ClearView Economics in Pepper Pike, Ohio, after the Commerce Department reported a decline in factory orders to $377.6 billion in July. That came after a 5.2 percent gain in June. 
 Manufacturing in the Chicago region contracted in August for the first time since January 1999, a separate survey of company purchasing managers found. The decline was punctuated by a drop in the new- orders index to its lowest in almost 10 years.
Factory production accounts for about one-fifth of economic output, and 18 months of industrial growth helped the expansion set a record for longevity earlier this year and propel it into its 10th year.
Retailers reported today that sales at stores open more than a year rose 3 percent in August, according to the Goldman Sachs retail composite index. That is less than July's 3.6 percent year-over-year increase and the 5.8 percent gain reported in August 1999.
The reports suggest that consumer spending, still the main driver of the economy, might be cooling. Consumer spending already slowed in the second quarter, to the slowest pace in three years, showing the effect of six interest-rate increases by Federal Reserve policy makers since June 1999.
A separate report from the Labor Department indicated cooling in job growth. While initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell by 3,000 last week, to 318,000, it was the third consecutive week with claims above 300,000.
The less-volatile four-week moving average rose to 313,000, the highest since 315,500 in the last week of January 1999. Claims have been affected by strikers at Verizon Communications who have since returned to work.
July's decline in factory orders surpassed the previous record drop of 6.6 percent in December 1974. The report showed orders excluding transportation equipment declined 2.6 percent in July after no change in June. Still, total orders placed with factories are up 9.5 percent so far this year compared with the first seven months of 1999.
The report from the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago for August suggested more cooling was possible nationwide. The report comes a day before a national report from the association.
The Chicago purchasers' index fell to 46.5 in August -- the lowest level since February 1996 -- from 52 in July. It was the first reading below 50 since 47.7 in January 1999. A reading above 50 indicates growth and one below means business has slowed.

HEADLINE: The Wrong Argument About Readiness

BYLINE: By William A. Owens; William A. Owens was vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1994 to 1996. He is the author of "Lifting the Fog of War."

 BODY:
As a 30-year veteran of the United States military, I'm glad that national security has become an issue in the presidential campaign. But I'm disheartened that the debate as it has played out so far has been far more partisan than enlightening.
Al Gore has said, "Our military is the strongest and the best in the entire world." 
 But in a speech on Wednesday, Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential nominee, said the Clinton administration had neglected national defense and was "running down" the military.
This echoes statements by George W. Bush that today's servicemen and women battle "back-to-back deployments, poor pay, shortages of spare parts and equipment, and rapidly declining readiness."
In his speech at the Republican convention, Mr. Bush charged that two of the Army's 10 divisions were not ready for a major war.
This sort of interchange does not begin to address the important defense challenges facing the nation. It exaggerates problems that don't threaten our national security while ignoring problems that do threaten it.
Let's examine the issues.
Lack of military readiness. Mr. Bush's charge that two army divisions were unprepared for war sounds serious, but is not particularly relevant. Every active duty force, every national guard and reserve unit is currently judged ready for combat according to a list of standards that are in many ways more appropriate for cold war missions and less appropriate for our troops that served in Bosnia, Kosovo and Rwanda. Troops need to be less like a tightly packed, hierarchical combat force, and more like a sophisticated, flexible police force.
Moreover, the list of standards fails to include equipment that may be especially important in today's missions, like high technology information systems, defenses against chemical and biological weapons and adequate numbers of precision weapons.
The Clinton administration has spent too much money to assure that our forces can, by and large, meet this outdated standard -- even troops who would not, in any circumstance, be used for months into a conflict. Certainly, the fact that all units don't meet every standard means far less than politicians may imply, and our current level of readiness is certainly not a significant threat to our national security.
Too many missions around the world. True, our forces are deployed too broadly, in dozens of places around the globe. And some units are overextended. But the grand mass of the American military is not deployed. The percentage of troops overseas is small. With management, both people and money could be moved from other parts of the services into overextended units.
Low morale and poor recruitment. We need to do more for our troops, including increasing their pay. And it is difficult to recruit and retain people, especially in a hot economy. But over the last decade, the military has been able to maintain its fighting force, and in the coming year, the services are expected to meet their recruiting goals. Moreover, today's morale, while low and needing attention, is not the kind of issue that is likely to bring down our national security. The situation today is not the post-Vietnam military that many decry.
A failure to look ahead. So what issue should our presidential candidates be concerned with? The military's ability to meet challenges five to 15 years from now.
The Clinton administration, to avoid charges of military unreadiness, made sure that today, every division is combat-ready. But that required billions of dollars and precluded buying enough equipment -- ships, tanks, tents -- for the future. The military procurement budget has been cut by about 60 percent since the end of the cold war (the overall budget is down by only 35 percent).
Some of the results can be seen today. The average age of vehicles is much older than in the past. Indeed, some Marine and Army helicopters are older than the pilots who fly them. Because it takes many years to replace equipment, in 10 to 15 years, there could be 30 percent fewer airplanes, ships, tanks and trucks. The ones that do exist will be older -- and harder to keep running -- than the ones today.
Moreover, the military has been unable to invest in America's information technology. For instance, it has not been able to buy enough battlefield sensors and communications, which would allow commanders to have information about an entire battlefield.
Both the White House and the Republican Congress are responsible for this situation. Our presidential candidates should address it. And the next administration and Congress should fix it.

HEADLINE: Long Nomads, the Inuit Find a Settled Life Unsettling

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: IQALUIT, Nunavut, Aug. 29

 BODY:
In this brand new territory, where new government buildings rise on nameless muddy streets, people had barely learned that the former speaker of the legislature had been convicted of sexual assault when they heard today that their education minister had been charged with beating up a woman.
This dual attack on the pride of this 17-month-old territory seemed to highlight the rocky cultural transition of the Inuit, who compose 85 percent of Nunavut's 27,000 residents. 
 Telescoping centuries of sociological change into two generations, the Inuit, known as Eskimos in Alaska and Greenland, have moved from the life of nomadic hunters who survived for centuries in one of the world's harshest environments to a modern, sedentary life marked by snowmobiles, heated homes and satellite television.
One price for this wrenching change has been Canada's highest rate of violent crime, with one attack reported each year for every 19 residents. Last year Nunavut registered 204 sexual assaults, about 10 times the national per-capita average, and 1,115 assaults, nearly six times the national average.
In the past, when attacks on women were debated, callers to radio stations sometimes criticized women's shelters for interfering in traditional family life. Elders reminded listeners that in traditional Inuit society, a man was allowed to beat his wife if she lied to him, was unfaithful or talked too much.
"Men would call in and say, 'The shelters are ruining my marriage,' " said the wife of a territorial minister. "Older women would say: 'I was beaten. If we talk too much, we are beaten.' "
But now younger Inuit, separated by a generation or more from the harsh life of surviving in a wilderness of snow and ice, are saying Inuit should adapt their relations to their new lives in houses and villages.
"We as an Inuit nation need to sit down and reflect," said Simona Arnatsiaq, women's program coordinator of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association. "There has been so much change in 50 years. We used to live as families in camps. Now we live in settled communities. We have to discuss getting along in large groups."
Across this vast territory, three times the size of Texas, alcoholism, high unemployment and crowded housing contribute to high rates of sexual assault. Noting that there are two people per room in the territory, twice the national average, Ann Roberts, the chief medical officer, said, "With the drinking, the ennui, the crowded housing stock -- this is the recipe for sexual assault."
For territorial legislators, who have some of the highest-paying jobs in the Arctic, the problem may stem from alcohol mixed with domineering attitudes about women. But even with two members now charged in cases of violence against women, there has been mostly silence from the 19-member Legislative Assembly, 18 of whom are men. Although women across Nunavut have started signing protest petitions, there has been little public reaction from Peter Kattuck, the minister responsible for the status of women.
From Rankin Inlet, Nunavut's second-largest town, Evelyn Thordarson, director of the women's shelter, said of members of the Assembly, "When you go, you take an oath to serve the people, not to harm the people, not to break the law."
Last March, in the first blow to the Assembly, the police arrested Levi Barnabas, the 36-year-old speaker, and charged him with sexual assault. According to the police, Mr. Barnabas, after a night of heavy drinking, tried to have sex with a friend's wife at a house here. The woman resisted and woke up her husband, who chased the legislator into the street, hitting him three times with a baseball bat.
Two weeks ago, Mr. Barnabas was found guilty and received a one-year jail sentence, which was suspended on the condition that he pay $1,000 to the women's shelter here, perform 240 hours of community service and stay out of Iqaluit's two bars for six months.
Under pressure from the Assembly's leaders, Mr. Barnabas resigned his seat. But the politician, who has represented Canada's northernmost Arctic villages for the last five years, before and after the creation of Nunavut, soon announced that constituents were urging him to run in the special election for his seat.
"With the Levi Barnabas case, people are seeing this and asking: 'What is the point of bringing charges? He only got community hours,' " Ms. Thordason said.
Newspaper editorialists say the Assembly, through its silence, is sending out a message of male impunity. "The male-dominated legislature has been strangely silent over the issue," News North Nunavut, a weekly, wrote in an editorial Monday. "The government had a golden opportunity to take a stand against violence directed at women. Their silence trivialized the severity of Barnabas's crime."
But this week's case may make addressing the issue of violence against women unavoidable.
On Saturday, Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers arrested James Arvaluk, 52, the education minister, and charged him with assault. The police say the victim was a woman at his home in Coral Harbor, about 435 miles west of here.
In 1995, when Mr. Arvaluk represented that area in the legislature of the Northwest Territories, he spent time in jail after being convicted of two charges of sexual assault.
"People were having trouble with him as minister of education with the sexual assault conviction," said the wife of another minister. "Now this charge involves bringing booze into a dry community."
When the Legislative Assembly resumes session in mid-October, Ms. Arnatsiaq said, the first order of business should be to set an example by adopting a code of ethics and a policy of zero tolerance among members for assaults on women.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
Europeans Raise Rates, Yet Euro Falls

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Aug. 31

 BODY:
It was supposed to be a show of toughness, an antidote to the weakness that has plagued Europe's single currency, the euro, over much of the time since its introduction in January 1999.
But when the European Central Bank raised interest rates today for the sixth time in less than a year, the euro foundered near its all-time low, amid widespread fear that it will sink even lower. Indeed, more than any other time in the short history of the euro, many financial analysts view the central bank as weak and off balance in response to changes in the region's economic climate. 
 "They are behind the curve," said Thomas Mayer, a senior economist with Goldman, Sachs in Frankfurt, who argues that the bank is becoming tougher just as European economic growth shows signs of becoming weaker. "In April 1999, they reduced interest rates even though the economy already seemed to be taking off. We could very well be in a similar situation right now."
Alarmed in large part by what it called the "protracted depreciation" of the euro, the central bank increased its baseline interest rate by a quarter-point today, to 4.5 percent. In a brief statement, the bank said that the euro's weakness threatened to push up the cost of imported goods at a time when high oil prices -- compounded by the commodity pricing of crude oil in dollars -- were threatening to ripple through Europe's economies.
But if the move was supposed to build confidence in the euro, it did not. Within minutes after the announcement, the euro slipped slightly, to roughly 89 cents against the dollar. It fell further later in the day, sliding as low as 88.45 before settling at 88.78 cents in New York trading, down from 89.24 cents on Wednesday.
By any measure, the European Central Bank faces a devilish problem. The euro has lost nearly a quarter of its value against the dollar since its introduction, and the biggest cause of that decline has been the United States' magnetic pull on investment capital.
If a weak euro should fuel inflation, the currency's credibility and value in world markets can be expected to slip further. But if the central bankers slow economic growth in an effort to prevent inflation, the euro could lose value as investors and corporations tilt more heavily away from Europe and toward the United States. "European corporations are voting with their pocketbooks," said Paul Mortimer-Lee, markets economist with BNP Paribas in London. "If you raise interest rates too far, there is a danger you will squeeze growth."
Though European inflation remains extremely low, at an annual rate of 2.4 percent a year, it has been gathering strength and is now above the central bank's limit of 2 percent.
Many analysts argue that the bank and its president, Wim Duisenberg, are clamping down on the money supply at a time European economic growth may already be tapering off. Though economists predict that the overall growth of countries in the euro zone will be more than 3 percent this year and next, recent surveys show that business confidence declined in Germany, France and Belgium in the last month.
The inflationary signals have been ambiguous as well. Stripping out the effects of one-time increases and of crude oil prices -- $33.12 a barrel in New York today -- the underlying rate of inflation is very modest, at 1.3 percent. And though higher oil prices can ripple through the rest of the economy, especially in wage demands, the European Central Bank's most recent assessment is that those effects have not shown up in goods unrelated to energy costs.
Partly as a result, the move to raise interest rates has so far had the opposite effect on the euro than the central bankers wanted. In the two weeks since they began sending out hints of their intentions, the euro has significantly weakened. Indeed, after staging a modest rebound in June, the currency is now just a smidgen above a record intraday low in European trading of 88.25 cents against the dollar.
The E.C.B. has trapped itself, Mr. Mortimer-Lee of BNP Paribas said, by setting an inflation target that is too rigid. The Bank of England and the Swedish central bank -- neither country is part of the euro-zone -- have set targets around 2 percent but allowed for flexibility by allowing the rate to vary by one percentage point above or below the target. The European Central Bank, by contrast, has fixed 2 percent as the upper limit and never really set a lower limit.
To be sure, economists and analysts generally agree that the euro's woes reflect the persistently faster growth of the United States in comparison with Europe. "There is a massive flow of money into the United States," said Ian Gunner, a currency analyst in London with ABN Amro, "and that has become a major new influence in the past two years."
But the United States' investment allure ties back to its higher growth rate.
"Why do companies want to take over other companies?" Mr. Gunner asked. "It has to do with the general well-being of the economy. The euro zone is one year into its recovery, and the E.C.B. is already worried about inflation. That is just not very impressive."
Since the euro was introduced, the region has experienced a net investment outflow of about 200 billion euros -- both direct investment in companies and property, and portfolio investments in stocks and bonds. Much of that reflects a sharp increase in trans-Atlantic mergers, most recently the Credit Suisse Group's $12.8 billion deal announced this week to acquire the investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
But a number of analysts complain that the European Central Bank has been inherently slow to recognize changing economic conditions. Such critics think that the bank erred when it reduced its core interest rate to 2.5 percent from 3 percent in April 1999. At the time, central bankers were afraid that lingering effects of the Asian financial crisis and the severe economic problems in Russia would lead to a slowdown in Western Europe. The fears were correct, but late: by the time interest rates were decreased, Europe was already exhibiting many signs of renewed economic growth.
The current problems are complicated by the widening divergence of growth rates within the euro zone. Germany, with the largest economy, lagged far behind the pack, growing by less than 2 percent in 1999. But Ireland has grown at well above 5 percent. Consumer prices there are increasing at an annual rate of 6.2 percent, with housing prices surging about 21 percent.
"With the E.C.B., the president is more of a moderator and consensus builder than a strong leader," Mr. Mayer of Goldman, Sachs said. The process of building a consensus is more time-consuming and difficult than at the Federal Reserve, he said, and that may have made the European Central Bank slower in its response.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
House Prices in Queens Exceed One Developer's Expectations

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
When the developers of Waterside Estates at Cresthaven in the Whitestone Woods section of Queens began sales two years ago, they deliberately set prices low -- $500,000 and up -- in hopes of building demand.
Now less than halfway through the planned 110 houses, they say the strategy has worked so well, with help from the generally rising real estate market, that their prices are running about $100,000 higher than they had originally projected that they would be getting now. The fact that the houses sit near the waterfront did not hurt, either. 
 "We knew we opened below market, but that is a common strategy," said Philip Megna, a partner in the Mattone Group of College Point who is overseeing the Waterside Estates project. He said that he had assumed the houses would be selling in the mid- to high-$600,000's by now, but that they were selling in the mid-$700,000's. "There is a lot of demand to live in that area, and we have a very strong economy."
Forty-three houses have been built or are under construction and 67 more are planned. By the time all 25 houses in the first phase were under contract in October, they were selling for up to $675,000. Some buyers in that group have already moved in and the remainder are expected to do so in the fall.
Prices for the second phase (27 houses, of which 19 have been sold) began rising about three months ago, starting at $605,000 and going up to $750,000, depending on which of three models was chosen. There will be 58 houses in the last phase, some of them on larger lots and all of them either on the water or with water views. "We anticipate that the waterfront housing will sell in the $1 million area," Mr. Megna said.
The development is on 12 acres of prime real estate between the Whitestone and Throgs Neck Bridges, where Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, once operated a children's summer camp. Associated Development Corporation of Bayside is collaborating in the development with the Mattone Group. The architect is John Stacom and the financing is being handled by the CFS Bank, based in Westbury, N.Y.
The houses are similar, all basically long and narrow, on plots 40 to 45 feet wide by 100 to 120 feet long. The differences are in the details, the slope of a roof, the shape of a window, the style of a kitchen cabinet.
Buyers have been individualizing them by choosing everything from the color of the exterior bricks to the shape of the kitchen sink faucets.
Besides the basic choices, appliances, decorative touches and amenities can be upgraded for additional fees. The first houses were sold strictly on the basis of dollhouse-size models. "People were spending a half a million dollars on houses they hadn't seen, on land that hadn't been cleared," Mr. Megna said.
Not surprisingly, the proximity to water has been a draw. There will be a private beach for the use of residents.
"There is very little waterfront property in Queens and certainly very little available for development," said Lawrence Rosano, a member of the development team. "A house in the neighborhood sold for $900,000 last year and the buyer tore it apart and probably put in another $400,000."
The taxes are another attraction. Thanks to the city's 421b tax abatement program, the taxes for the first two years of ownership are based solely on the assessed value of the raw land. "That means that for the first two years, they would be $400 to $500 a year," said Marilyn Larsen, owner of Lane Realty in Great Neck, N.Y., and the director of sales. "So a $750,000 home here is $500 a year and will be phased in to a full $4,000 a year at the end of eight years."
A comparable house in Glen Cove in Nassau County would probably be taxed at more than $18,000, she said.
None of the houses in Westside Estates are built until they are sold.
"They are not being put up on spec," Mr. Rosano said. "In Queens, more routinely you build and then sell. Buyers are used to seeing something complete."
Once there are contracts and mortgage commitments, the houses go up in clusters. Two of the three models, the Driftwood and the Sandpiper, are high ranches, with the living room, dining room, kitchen and two or three bedrooms upstairs, and a large recreation room downstairs. The center-hall, colonial-style Sandcastle has the more traditional configuration of living room, dining room and kitchen downstairs, and three bedrooms upstairs.
The developers say that their project marks a departure from the attached houses and town houses that have dominated new construction in the area in recent years. "We think this may be the largest single-family development in maybe 50 years," Mr. Megna said.
So far, 98 percent of the buyers have been from Queens. "For most of them, this is their second or third home," Mr. Megna said.
When the former day camp was sold, Catholic Charities kept six and a half acres, where it plans to build three low-rise buildings with 200 apartments for elderly people with moderate incomes.

HEADLINE: Drought Devastates Rural Texas Economy

BYLINE: By ROSS E. MILLOY 

DATELINE: LOCKHART, Tex., Aug. 31

 BODY:
At the weekly livestock auction on the outskirts of town, there is something in the air even heavier than the dust and stench: fear of the devastation this summer's drought is bringing.
"We're hurting all right, and it may get to be a lot worse before it gets any better," said M. M. Pogue, a cattle rancher from Lytton Springs near this Central Texas stopping point on the Chisholm Trail, 25 miles southeast of Austin. 
 Mr. Pogue, who can tick off the memorable droughts of his 84 years as easily as some might list their children's names, said this summer's drought may turn out to be one of the worst.
"A lot of people are going to be knocked right out of the cattle business by this one," he said.
This summer's record stretch of 62 days without rain in North Texas, after four years in which some areas of the state have had almost no appreciable rain, has left thousands of acres of crops wasted, dried up lakes and helped spark 650 fires.
"We are in the midst of an unmitigated disaster," said Allen Spelce, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Agriculture, "and it has been accumulating in magnitude over the last five years."
It is little better in much of the South and West. The Great Plains and the Southeast have been baking in 100-degree temperatures this week, fires are destroying tinder-dry forests in most Western states and Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and North Florida continue to suffer from drought, despite intermittent rain.
Bill Proensa, director of the National Weather Service's Southern regional office in Fort Worth, said there was little hope of immediate relief.
More than 89 people have died from the heat nationwide, Mr. Proensa said, 52 of them in Texas.
"We're seeing record temperatures and record series of consecutive high temperatures in many places," he said, citing Wednesday's record of 111 degrees at Little Rock, Ark.
But Texas is bearing the brunt of the drought, he said. In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the temperature was 100 or higher in 39 of the last 60 days, Mr. Proensa said.
"The only thing that will help us now is a hurricane," he said, "and there's no sign of one of those in the forecast."
In Texas and adjacent states, 177 counties have been declared disaster areas for crop losses so far by the federal Department of Agriculture, and state officials predict those losses, currently calculated at $595 million for Texas alone, will soar past a billion dollars by year's end.
Droughts since 1996 have cost Texas farmers and ranchers over $5 billion, Mr. Spelce said.
North Texas today blew past a 66-year-old record by posting 62 consecutive days without rain, eclipsing even the notorious drought of 1950 and the "Dust Bowl drought" of 1934.
And, as lake levels continue to drop, at least three power plants in West Texas warned customers that they may be forced to shut down because there would not be enough water to cool the plants' electricity generating equipment unless the area gets rain soon.
"This is an uncommon event and a very real danger," said Jim Calloway, a senior engineer with the Texas Public Utilities Commission. "There's a definite possibility that we'll have to shut those plants down if we don't get rain by November."
Power to those served by the plants, Mr. Calloway said, could be provided from other sources in Texas, but at a potentially higher cost.
In parched Central Texas, reduced water levels in the Edwards Aquifer have cut flows to Comal Springs, the state's largest spring, to the point that endangered species of fish are threatened.
At the popular Jacob's Well spring midway between Austin and San Antonio, which has never been known to go dry, water flow has been cut from a normal 75 gallons per second to less than 7 gallons per second.
"The canary in the coal mine is on its back, kicking its legs up in the air," said David Baker, who lives near Jacob's Well.
In Georgia, the drought is ravaging the state's thirsty cities and farms in the northern and central parts of the state.
David Stooksbury, the state climatologist, estimates that it will take two winters of normal rainfall to replenish aquifers, rivers, creeks, ponds, and reservoirs and to saturate the soil depths needed to nurture crops and lawns.
At least 721 wells have run dry in southwest Georgia this summer. Last year only a few were reported dry in the same region, said Mel Jones, an environmentalist for the state health agency.
A statewide survey found approximately 23 cities, primarily in northern Georgia, face critical water shortages, said Harold Reheis, director of the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. Many have a water supply of only 30 days or less.
In Carrollton, approximately 50 miles southwest of Atlanta, Lewis Mason, water plant superintendent, said, "We estimate we've got around 60 to 65 days of water left. We're obviously on a total ban -- no outside watering or anything like that."
Crop losses in Texas and Georgia have been staggering.
By midsummer the drought had already damaged approximately 39 percent or an estimated $738 million in the Georgia's corn, cotton, peanuts, soybeans, tobacco, pecans and forage crops, said Charles McPeake of the University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Service.
Texas officials say cotton, grain, and wheat losses already top $425 million.
But with pastures scorched, and stock tanks reduced to mud puddles, it is the cattlemen who seem to be suffering the most.
Miguel Carrillo, at the Lockhart auction with his father to sell 20 cows, said he just could not afford to feed them through the winter.
"Our hay crop never really made this year," Mr. Carrillo said, "and all our fields are burned to a crisp. We've got to sell now or go broke later."
Mike Alonzo, a cattle rancher near here, said: "If you've got water but no feed, you can haul feed. If you've got feed but no water, you can haul water. But if you don't have feed or water, the way it is with this here drought, you're in big trouble."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Main Gauges Advance Smartly as Inflation Fears Ebb

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
Responding to fresh signs that the Federal Reserve may be able to avoid further interest rate increases, investors pushed stock prices up briskly yesterday, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index approaching a record.
The government reported that factory orders declined 7.5 percent in July, the biggest decline on record, and another report showed that industry in the Chicago area contracted in August to the lowest point since 1996. The nation's merchants also reported that sales in August rose only 3 percent, below analysts' expectations. 
 The data suggests that six interest rate increases by Fed policy makers since June 1999 may be taking hold and slowing the economy, possibly easing the central bank's concern about inflation.
Shares of brokerage firms and other financial companies were standouts, continuing to benefit from this week's bid by Credit Suisse for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. J. P. Morgan leaped $16.13, to $167.19, accounting for most of a 112.09-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average that reversed Wednesday's decline. The Dow closed up 1 percent, to 11,215.10. It is now down 2.5 percent for the year.
But the better general performance was in the Nasdaq composite index, which has made gains in 13 of the last 15 sessions. It soared 102.54 points, or 2.5 percent, to 4,206.35.
"The market is more pleased about what steady interest rates mean for valuations than worried about what a slower economy will do to earnings," said Byron R. Wien, chief United States strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
The S.& P. 500 advanced 15.09 points, or 1 percent, to 1,517.68, giving it a 3.3 percent gain for the year. Of its components, 306 rose while 167 fell and 27 were unchanged. It is now just 10 points shy of its record.
"I'm not excited by the performance of the Dow, but I am excited by the S.& P. and Nasdaq creeping up" out of established trading ranges, said Michael Strauss, managing director of Commonfund, which invests college endowments.
He said he thought the markets were encouraged by the post-convention bounce in the polls by Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, because it suggested maintenance of the political status quo in Washington assuming Republicans maintain their majority in Congress. "Divided government is better for financial markets," Mr. Strauss said.
Others, including Andrew Brooks of T. Rowe Price, were reluctant to seek trends in a preholiday summer period. "It's easy to push stocks around this week because a lot of people are out," he said. Some investors were no doubt engaged in month-end transactions, while others remained on the sidelines awaiting today's report on the August labor market.
Volume did perk up, with 1.07 billion changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with 818.4 million on Wednesday. Advancing issues there outnumbered declining ones by 1,727 to 1,156, while 137 stocks made new 52-week highs and 29 slumped to new lows.
Ford Motor, which has lost about one-fifth of its value over the last three weeks, was among the day's most prominent casualties. The automaker, caught up in a huge tire recall and found by a court in California to have knowingly installed faulty ignitions, dropped as low as $23.81 before closing at $24.25, down $1.75.
Retail stocks continued to sag, with Target skidding $2.88, to $23.19, after warning of a profit shortfall in the third quarter. J. C. Penney, which said it might trim its forecast, also slumped.
Clear Channel Communications, down $5.38, to $72, and Ford were the most heavily traded Big Board issues, with 28.5 million shares traded for Ford, the most for the company in a single day in at least 20 years. Dell Computer, the subject of a prominent article in The Wall Street Journal, climbed $3.69, to $43.63, on Nasdaq as 64.2 million of its shares changed hands, the most of any issue.

Treasury Prices Rise
By The Associated Press
Bond prices rose yesterday after reports suggested the economy was slowing, a situation that greatly eases inflation fears.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 17/32, to 100 8/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.72 percent from 5.79 percent on Wednesday. The 30-year bond rose 30/32, to 108 12/32. Its yield fell to 5.66 percent from 5.73 percent.
Treasuries were lifted by a Commerce Department report that showed factory orders dropped a record 7.5 percent in July, while orders excluding transportation dipped a smaller 2.6 percent.
The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said business activity fell to 46.5 in August from 52.0 in July. The figures indicate Chicago-area manufacturing activity is contracting -- something that is probably happening nationwide, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Hertz Says Earnings Will Fall Short in 2 Quarters

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: PARK RIDGE, N.J., Aug. 31

 BODY:
The Hertz Corporation warned today that it expects third-quarter and fourth-quarter earnings to fall short of analysts' estimates because of competitive prices in the car-rental business and canceled flights at United Airlines.
Hertz, the car-rental agency, said it expected third-quarter earnings of $1.30 a share and fourth-quarter earnings of 51 cents a share. A First Call/Thomson Financial poll of eight analysts had an average estimate of $1.43 for the third quarter and 63 cents for the fourth quarter. 
 Plans to raise prices on car rentals in the third quarter were scuttled by a "very competitive" market, said the company, which is based in Park Ridge. In mid-July, Hertz said it would raise United States daily, weekend and weekly rates to make up for higher wages and car prices.
"We'll be looking for the right opportunity to increase prices because that's absolutely necessary in the U. S.," said a Hertz spokesman, Richard Broome. "Obviously, now is not the right time."
Car rentals were also hurt by a labor dispute that forced the UAL Corporation's United Airlines to cancel or delay thousands of flights, Mr. Broome said. UAL reached a tentative contract agreement with its pilots union last weekend.
Additional factors included weather-related airport disruptions, higher interest rates and unfavorable foreign exchange rates, Hertz said.
Revenue in the United States car-rental business should rise 8 percent for the third quarter and 7 percent for the fourth quarter compared with corresponding periods in 1999, Hertz said. International car rentals should have revenue growth of 8 percent each quarter, excluding currency effects, Hertz said.
Hertz cut its estimates for revenue growth in equipment rentals, now expecting 11 percent to 13 percent.
Full-year earnings will be about $3.30 a share, Hertz said. Analysts had expected $3.49 a share. First-quarter earnings are expected to fall short of the 52 cents a share earned in the first quarter of this fiscal year, the company said.
Hertz operates from about 6,500 sites in the United States and in more than 140 countries. It had revenue of $4.72 billion last year.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Religion on the Hustings

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
When Senator Joseph I. Lieberman urged a greater role for religion in public life in campaign speeches this week, he touched off a new round in the sharp but unsettled debate over the role that personal beliefs should play in American politics.
Some critics of Mr. Lieberman's remarks, including the Anti-Defamation League, cast the issue in terms of separation of church and state, suggesting that the senator had infringed that principle. 
 But another way to look at what Mr. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, said is to ask whether American culture has changed enough of late so that his remarks are more acceptable, socially and politically, than before.
Those who say such a change has taken place can cite various reasons -- public unease over the political scandals of the late 1990's, for example, or the longer-term emergence of religious conservatives as a political force or a less tangible but pervasive interest in the personal over the political.
"I think the Christian Coalition has added to our dialogue on politics and religion," said Paul Simon, the former Democratic senator from Illinois, referring both to the conservative organization of that name and also to the broader political movement of religious conservatives. "Now, some of that is not good, but some of that is good, too."
Mr. Simon, who now directs the Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University, said he thought Mr. Lieberman had made his remarks "with great care." But he also said that some of the religious language used in the presidential campaign had left him uncomfortable.
"My overall impression," Mr. Simon said, "is, the deeply religious people don't talk about it as much."
Mr. Lieberman, the first Jew on a major American presidential ticket, said in a speech last Sunday that Americans needed to "renew the dedication of our nation and ourselves to God and God's purpose." And while he said the Constitution "wisely separates church from state," he added that there must be a place for faith in the nation's public life.
In reacting to his remarks, some harkened back to the example set by John F. Kennedy, who sought to reassure voters in 1960 that his Roman Catholicism would not dictate his policies as president. Religious belief, Kennedy's words implied, is private.
But four decades have elapsed since then, a long stretch in the cultural life of a still-young nation. In the United States, as Mr. Lieberman noted on Monday, polls show that religious belief remains unusually widespread, certainly when compared with Europe. Surveys report that 19 out of 20 Americans say they believe in God.
What is more, the American marketplace -- both a guide to and an influence upon the broader culture -- recognizes no separation of the sacred and the profane, such that books by the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, can soar onto the best-seller lists, and CBS can broadcast a reverent mini-series on Jesus during its spring sweeps period.
There is some statistical evidence, too, that public attitudes about religion and politics have shifted since the 1960's, blurring whatever boundary might have existed between the two.
A new book, "The Diminishing Divide: Religion's Changing Role in American Politics" (Brookings Institution, 2000), reports that whereas a narrow majority of Americans in 1968 wanted churches to stay out of politics, that opposition had eroded by 1996, when a narrow majority said churches should freely express their views.
One of the book's four authors, John Green, a professor of political science at the University of Akron, said that "a greater demand" existed for religious talk in political life and that there was also "a greater supply of it."
"I think the public is more interested in values these days, particularly questions of morality, than they have been in the recent past," said Professor Green, who directs the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at his university.
Professor Green said several factors were at work, among them diminishing worry over economic and international threats and a growing concern over the turmoil of political scandals, high school shootings and hate crimes.
Political leaders "have sensed this disquiet, and want to respond to it," Professor Green said, either by speaking of religious faith or talking more about broad values, as Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, does in speaking of the need for "prosperity with a purpose."
One person critical of Mr. Lieberman this week, Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, agreed in part with some of Dr. Green's assessment, saying Americans had been shaken by the personal scandals involving political leaders, notably President Clinton and the former House speaker Newt Gingrich.
"It's a general sense that our political leaders have failed us because they lacked moral grounding," Mr. Lynn said.
As a result, he said, candidates "feel compelled not just to say, here's my moral vision, but here's the religion that underlies it."
Mr. Lynn called that "unhealthy" for a diverse society and a threat to provoke a sort of spiritual one-upmanship among candidates, each feeling so compelled to cite Scripture that the race for office becomes like "a final exam in Bible studies."
Yet others suggest that the high profile that religion is receiving in the current presidential campaign reflects a subtler, longer-term trend, a growing interest among Americans in hearing the personal narratives, not simply the technical ideas, of their leaders.
"People want to hear your story," said Richard J. Mouw, president of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif. "I think today the question is, What kind of person is this, what kind of leader will he be?"
In that case, Dr. Mouw said, "having that person speak out of the depths of his own human experience, that kind of comes to be a value thing."
Dr. Mouw, who found Mr. Lieberman's statements pleasing, said that American society was more open to public expressions of religious identity than it was 30 years ago, when he received his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Chicago.
"As a philosopher, you had to hide your religious convictions," he said, contrasting that with the present situation, in which Christian philosophers have their own association, which publishes a journal.
"It's much more acceptable in the academic world than it was in 1970 to identify your religious convictions and speak openly about them," Dr. Mouw said.

HEADLINE: Firestone Struggles in Center Of an Ever-Widening Storm

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Rarely has a leading global company faced such an extraordinary confluence of problems: its flagship product blamed for scores of deaths; its biggest customer undermining its every defense; its stock price plunging along with consumer confidence; its top executive summoned before an angry Congress.
This is not how Firestone planned to celebrate its 100th birthday this summer. The centennial, some marketing experts say, has turned into a debacle for one of America's most familiar brand names. 
 In Washington today, regulators added 26 deaths to the 62 previously attributed to failures of Firestone tires in the United States. In Venezuela, one of 17 countries where Firestone tires have been recalled, the government's consumer agency asked the state prosecutor to bring criminal charges against Firestone. It also called for prosecuting the Ford Motor Company, saying the design of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles that were equipped with Firestone tires contributed to dozens of deaths in crashes there.
Until today, Ford officials insisted that their company would stand by Firestone as a supplier. But Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, refused during a news conference in Dearborn, Mich., to reiterate that stance. "This has been an extremely difficult and disappointing period in our relationship, and we'll take this a day at a time," he said.
Executives of Bridgestone/Firestone and its Japanese parent, the Bridgestone Corporation, insist the Firestone brand will survive. John Lampe, the American subsidiary's executive vice president, said here this morning that to restore customers' confidence, the company would soon appoint an independent investigator to look into the company's products and practices.
But Firestone soon may face a fresh storm. As Mr. Lampe spoke in an interview at an airport hotel, angry union workers prepared to demonstrate in front of his company's American headquarters here. Close to 8,000 workers could go on strike Saturday morning at nine Firestone plants in the United States.
Marketing experts are gloomy about Firestone's prospects. Tylenol survived a poisoning scare a decade ago. Ford survived the problem of Pintos that caught fire during collisions two decades ago. And Firestone itself survived a much larger recall of its Firestone 500 car tires in 1978.
But now, under the unblinking glare of 24-hour news channels and the Internet, Firestone -- pilloried again as insufficiently concerned about safety -- is especially vulnerable because consumer loyalty to tire brands is weak, said Jack F. Trout, the president of a market research company that bears his name in Greenwich, Conn.
"I think their chance of survival is certainly in question," Mr. Trout said. "There might be irreparable damage to the brand."
Mr. Lampe said "business was normal" for tires not subject to the recall, but also noted that the recall was taking up mechanics' time and filling service bays, which would affect sales. General Motors repeated today that it had not found problems with Firestone tires and would keep buying them. But the costs of the recall and expectations of lower sales have knocked 45 percent off Bridgestone's stock price in Tokyo trading during August.
Firestone had slowly gained market share over the last three years at the expense of its two global archrivals -- Goodyear and Michelin -- by heavily marketing the success of Firestone tires on the racetrack. Now its rivals are having their revenge. Goodyear, still the market leader in the United States, has just stepped up its advertising, particularly of tires for sport utility vehicles.
"We have responded, we believe appropriately and effectively, to the market opportunities out there," said Chuck Sinclair, a Goodyear spokesman.
The crashes involving the recalled tires -- 15-inch ATX and ATX II tires made anywhere in North America and 15-inch Wilderness models made only in Decatur, Ill. -- have occurred mainly in Sun Belt states. Tire dealers and customers in the region said today that consumer confidence in the Firestone brand had been shaken.
"I want to get a different brand of tires," said Allison Leodler, a University of Texas student leaving a Firestone service center in Austin, explaining she had been waiting two weeks for replacement tires for her 1998 Explorer. "It's been horrible. I canceled a trip to Houston to see my parents a few days ago because I'm scared to drive on the highway."
Understanding the tumult in the United States poses a special challenge for Bridgestone in Japan. People who follow the industry in Tokyo describe the parent company as lacking in public relations skill. "Bridgestone has a tradition that 'no news is good news,' even when it's good news," said Roger Schreffler, a long-time auto journalist there.
Bridgestone has no Americans on its board, even though half the company's sales are in the United States. Here in Nashville, 5 of the 10 corporate officers of Bridgestone/Firestone are Japanese. They handle communications with Japan, said Mr. Lampe -- who, like most of the American executives, does not speak Japanese.
Though analysts have viewed the tire maker's response to the recall as tin-eared and defensive -- especially in comparison with that of Ford, which has often released information as quickly as it obtains it from Firestone -- Mr. Lampe said that he did not believe that the company's foreign ownership had interfered at all with its handling of the crisis.
Still, the timing of the recall could not be worse for Firestone's management. Since the early 1990's, the American operations have been led by two Japanese executives in close partnership. Kenji Shibata, the president, has overseen sales and marketing issues, while Masatoshi Ono, the chief executive, is an engineer who has handled manufacturing and technical issues.
But Mr. Shibata, who speaks fluent English and sometimes served as an interpreter for fellow Japanese executives, retired in early July. Mr. Lampe described the retirement as unrelated to the recall, which began on Aug. 9, although federal regulators opened an investigation in May.
Mr. Shibata's retirement has left the many issues facing the company in the hands of Mr. Ono, who conducts meetings in English but is sometimes uncertain whether he understands all the nuances when asked questions in English, said Trevor Hoskins, a retired senior vice president of Bridgestone/Firestone.
Mr. Ono, who declined repeated requests this week for an interview, is scheduled to testify before the House Commerce Committee next week. Mr. Nasser, who earlier in the week turned down an invitation to testify, said today he had changed his mind -- but Congressional aides said he pointedly refused to appear on the same panel as Mr. Ono.
Bridgestone has a reputation in Japan for an unyielding management style, especially compared with the more compromising approach of other Japanese multinationals.
A former executive told a Japanese newspaper that the first Japanese word that the company's American employees learned was "dam," or no. In Japan, an employee committed hara-kiri, or ritual suicide, in the office of Bridgestone's president last year, to draw attention to the cause of workers asked to leave the company.
But Mr. Lampe said Firestone under Japanese ownership had moved much faster this summer than it did in 1978, when it was still an American company and when the eventual recall was linked to 41 deaths. Then, Firestone fought regulators for a year and a half to prevent a recall and the release of documents which, when finally handed over, showed that the company had known of problems with Firestone 500 tires for several years and covered them up.
One big difference between then and now is that the 1978 recall involved many models, not just Ford vehicles, and automakers had little to say at the time.
By contrast, the current recall involves only vehicles made by Ford and its affiliates, and most of the deaths have involved Explorers that rolled over. Leery of letting the reputation of one of its most profitable models be harmed, Ford has been increasingly outspoken in blaming Firestone and has released extensive Firestone data showing problems dating back to at least 1997.
"This is a tire issue without question; it is not a vehicle issue," Mr. Nasser said today, later adding, "I'm sorry that these defective tires are on our vehicles."
Yet American regulators are examining Ford's role, notably its recommendation that the tires on Explorers be inflated to just 26 pounds a square inch -- lower than what is called for on many rival models.
For their part, Firestone officials have been loath to direct blame at their largest customer. But as Ford's comments have grown more pointed, they are beginning to point out that Firestone's very similar tires for other automakers' sport utility vehicles have not encountered similar problems.
"This situation is somewhat unprecedented in itself, because the incidents that we've seen and the problems that we've seen have been primarily on one size tire on one application," Mr. Lampe said. "We've got the same size tire on a number of other applications, and we're not seeing the same sort of circumstances."
Mr. Hoskins, who retired from Firestone nearly two years ago, was more blunt. "It has nothing to do with the tires," he said. "It has to do with S.U.V.'s, and with one kind of S.U.V. in particular." Ford officials have repeatedly pointed out that Explorers roll over less often than other midsize sport utility vehicles and that Explorers equipped with Goodyear tires have fared much better than those with Firestone tires.
With the tallies of deaths, and the lawsuits and government investigations mounting, life is only growing more difficult for Firestone officials. Since it became apparent on Aug. 6 that a recall would be necessary, Mr. Lampe said, "I have literally not been home except to sleep."

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT VETOES EFFORT TO REPEAL TAXES ON ESTATES

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
President Clinton today vetoed a Republican-sponsored bill to repeal the federal estate tax and stepped up the election-year sparring over tax cuts and how best to spend the budget surplus.
In remarks in the East Room of the White House, Mr. Clinton said the bill "fails the test of fairness and fiscal responsibility" because it is costly and, according to administration figures, benefits only the wealthiest 2 percent of the population. 
 The president accused Republicans of threatening to hamstring the booming economy by devising a series of tax cuts that he said would leave little money for Medicare, prescription drug benefits, education and a host of other programs.
Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly lobbed the same charge at his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who supports repealing the estate tax. And in vetoing the bill today, Mr. Clinton adopted the same sort of language heard from Mr. Gore on the campaign trail.
"I believe that this latest bill, this estate tax bill, is part of a series of actions and commitments that, when you add it all up would take us back to the bad old days of deficits, high interest rates and having no money to invest in our common future," Mr. Clinton said, echoing Mr. Gore's attacks on Mr. Bush's tax plans.
The bill "shows a sense of priorities that I believe got us in trouble in the first place in the 1980's, and that if we go back to those priorities, will get us in trouble again," he said.
In Congress, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois immediately announced that the House would try to override the veto as its first order of business when it returned next week.
The effort, which requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress, is expected to fail in the Senate and may fall short in the House, as well. Neither Republicans nor Mr. Clinton ruled out the possibility of a compromise today.
"The death tax punishes families for being successful," Mr. Hastert said, using the Republicans' preferred term for the estate tax.
"It punishes farmers. It punishes small business owners. It punishes those who have not planned ahead with an array of lawyers and accountants to keep their money in their family," he said.
"Down the road," he added, "it will punish our young entrepreneurs, who are just starting their own Internet or high-tech ventures."
Mr. Hastert has said he will also try to override Mr. Clinton's veto of a bill to give married couples a tax break, one in a series of bite-size tax cut proposals that Republicans have sent to the president in recent weeks.
The bill to repeal the estate tax had drawn broad Democratic support in Congress, especially in the House, where members recognized its allure to voters. Today, Mr. Clinton was careful not to dismiss the idea of curbing the estate tax and highlighted his party's proposals, which the Democrats say will provide more modest tax breaks for a greater number of people but which Republicans dismiss as having little impact.
"We are not against wealth and we are not against opportunity," Mr. Clinton said. "If I were against creating millionaires, I have been an abject failure in my years as president."
The current tax applies to estates worth more than $675,000, or $1.3 million for a family-owned farm or business, and by 2006 the limit would rise to $1 million. The Republican plan would have phased out the tax entirely over 10 years.
Only 2 percent of the families of those who die pay the estate tax, but Republicans argue that no one should have to pay the tax, which has a 55 percent top rate.
According to Congressional and White House estimates, the bill would cost $105 billion in the first 10 years, as the tax is phased out, and then $750 billion in the decade after the tax is repealed.
Although recent public opinion surveys show that the bill has proven popular among voters, Mr. Clinton's advisers say that is largely because it has been misunderstood. "Of the $750 billion the repeal costs, one-half -- nearly $400 billion -- goes to the top one-tenth of one percent of estates," said Gene Sperling, the president's national economic adviser.
Governor Bush, who has proposed a $1.3 trillion tax cut over 10 years, has endorsed the Republican estate tax repeal, incorporating it in his own plan. Today, Mindy Tucker, Mr. Bush's press secretary, accused Mr. Gore of "showing weak leadership" in "standing by while his administration vetoed a bill that would help so many hard-working Americans and their families."
Mr. Gore's proposal is more in line with the Democratic alternatives. Instead of phasing out the estate tax entirely, it would exempt all estates worth less than $5 million, and the results would be immediate.
"Most of the benefits under the Republican plan goes to the extremely wealthy," said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore campaign spokesman.
Since the national conventions, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore have jousted over the scale and wisdom of tax cuts at a time when the country is prospering economically.
The two have used the debate to underscore the two parties' traditional political philosophies, a theme House and Senate lawmakers are also pitching on the campaign trail.
Republicans say the surplus -- money not spent on protecting Social Security -- should be returned to the taxpayer and not spent by the government. Democrats believe it should be steered toward education, health care, Medicare and other programs.
"You let the surplus sit there in this town and people will spend it," Mr. Hastert said at a recent fund-raiser. "The best thing we can do is take that surplus off the table."
Setting aside their campaign rhetoric, though, both sides have inched toward the center, promising to pay down the debt and protect Social Security. While Democrats are devising their own tax cuts, Republicans are talking about spending more money on education.
Each party is also repackaging its ideas. House Republicans, for example, devised a different approach to tax cuts this year, after Mr. Clinton vetoed their mammoth tax-reduction bill last year. ("A cannonball that was too heavy to fly," Mr. Clinton said today.)
They divided the bill into smaller pieces and portrayed them as common-sense tax breaks for married couples and grieving families who do not want to break up the family farm to pay the tax man.
The idea of breaking up the bills has proved relatively fruitful, since it drew Democratic votes and appeared to please voters.
Mr. Clinton called the approach clever today, but then excoriated the end result, saying it would still cost too much and do little for low- and middle-income taxpayers.
"Everybody knows there is a lot more hard work to be done, and there are differences of opinion about what we ought to do and how we ought to do it," Mr. Clinton said. "That's why we're having another election this year. And that's up to the American people to decide.
"But I believe that prosperity imposes its own difficult choices, because there are so many temptations to do things that seem easy that will have adverse consequences."

HEADLINE: Despondent Parents See Foster Care as Only Option

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
Filled with a mixture of dread and relief one summer morning two years ago, Yahya Abdul-Hakam, an unemployed father of two, did what many fathers would find unthinkable: he turned his eldest daughter, then 11 years old, over to the city's foster care system.
Today, reluctantly recalling that moment, he says he had no choice. For several years, his daughter had been acting out at school, throwing things, screaming in class. At home, her angry outbursts resulted in fights with a younger sister, a cousin, sometimes even with him. Mr. Abdul-Hakam even admitted her to a psychiatric hospital once. 
 The morning he took her to the Lower Manhattan offices of the city's Administration for Children's Services, a tangle of emotions raced through him. "Fear, uneasiness, nervousness," he recounted. "It really came to a point where that was the only thing I could do."
Extreme as his action may seem, Mr. Abdul-Hakam's sense of frustration is shared by parents throughout the city. The range of options available to the privileged -- military-style private schools, private psychiatric treatment -- are not readily available to poor parents like him.
So instead, every day, dozens of them stream into a sixth-floor courtroom in Manhattan Family Court designated for these so-called voluntary placements citywide.
There is the father who quickly wearied of caring for his teenage son after the boy's mother died. There is the father who sent his daughter into foster care after a series of violent outbursts. There is the mother who initially sought court-ordered supervision for her misbehaving daughter, and when that did not work, signed her over to the city.
The other day, M. Jay Segal, the court referee hearing that case, turned to the girl's mother. "Ma'am, you don't want to take her home?" he asked.
Without a glance at her daughter, the woman shook her head. "She's going to run around," she said.
The girl, told she had no place to go other than back to her group home, sat in court, sobbing uncontrollably.
Citywide, just as involuntary admissions to foster care have declined in recent years, so have the number of voluntary placements. But the share of voluntarily placed youngsters among all children admitted to foster care has inched up slightly. One in 10 children admitted to foster care in the 1999 fiscal year were voluntarily placed, according to city figures. Children's lawyers estimate that voluntary placements make up 10 to 20 percent of the city's total foster care caseload.
Although hard numbers are not available, lawyers and social workers who work on these cases say adolescents, especially the disobedient and the emotionally disturbed, make up a significant and growing share of voluntary placements.
For some youngsters, a life in foster care can be a road to further decline. For others, especially those who need round-the-clock attention, it can be better than being at home. Either way, it exposes the peculiar predicament of overwhelmed parents who relinquish their children to an equally overwhelmed government bureaucracy -- one that is hardly equipped to care for, let alone rehabilitate, troubled teenagers.
Why would a parent voluntarily turn a child over to foster care? Sometimes, a parent or guardian is ill, homeless or incarcerated. Sometimes, child welfare officials offer voluntary placement as an alternative to filing abuse or neglect charges against the parents.
Occasionally, a parent simply wants to be done with a difficult child. Often, for parents under pressure, the child welfare system is the only way out.
"For parents who don't have a support system or the economic means to purchase a support system -- like after-school activities, summer camps -- the stresses are exacerbated," said Karen Freedman, executive director of Lawyers for Children, a nonprofit group that provides lawyers and social services for children who are voluntarily placed. "A lot of what these parents are feeling is fear for their children."
In Family Court, where despair competes daily with heartbreak, voluntary placement cases are among the saddest and most confounding. The adolescents are likely to end up in group homes rather than with foster families. If they need psychiatric care, the wait for a state-financed residential treatment center can sometimes be many months. Often, the youngsters simply run away from a group home, or wait until they become adults and leave the system.
Occasionally, social workers and advocates for children successfully persuade parents not to relinquish the children.
Margaret O'Marra, a Legal Aid social worker, says many of the children have suffered loss and trauma in early childhood. Others live with attention deficit disorder, depression or learning disabilities. "A good percentage of these kids are kids who have not gotten proper treatment in time," Ms. O'Marra said.
Mr. Abdul-Hakam's daughter was relatively lucky in that she was placed with foster parents, four families in two years. Mr. Abdul-Hakam wants her back home, he says, but not now. He wants first to move out of the one-bedroom Brooklyn apartment he shares with his wife and younger daughter, though for now, that seems out of reach.
Mr. Abdul-Hakam, 49, supports his family on public assistance, he says, cleaning a beach in Queens three days a week for his welfare check. And though his relationship with his daughter has improved in the last two years, he remains out of touch with the ordinary details of her life. He is not sure which school she will attend this month. He is not sure of the mental health diagnosis that has been made, nor of the name of the medications she has been taking. When and whether she will return home remains a mystery.
Lawyers who represent children like her say they tend to stay in care longer than others. Marta, a 15-year-old who had been shuttled among a series of caretakers before she landed in foster care last year, is no exception. When her mother was arrested on drug charges, Marta, who spoke on the condition that only her first name be used, was sent to her grandmother in Puerto Rico. When she started rebelling, she was returned to her father in New York. Father and daughter were virtual strangers, she said. Marta's grades slid. She did not finish the eighth grade. She ran the streets.
That, she said, is when the beatings began. Her father beat her for bad grades and for not cleaning her room. When she reported it to her favorite teacher and the child welfare agency was summoned, her father, who did not return calls requesting comment, was offered the option of voluntarily placing Marta in foster care. Marta did not object.
What followed was a foster home in Yonkers, group homes in Brooklyn and Westchester, and finally, a residential treatment center upstate, where she still lives.
She now sounds almost sympathetic to her father. She misses him, but knows he is not ready to take her back. "I know why he wanted me here -- he wanted the best for me," she said. "He wasn't doing it for his best. He was doing it for my best."
Now 15, Marta would prefer to remain in foster care until her 18th birthday because, as she puts it, she would like to give her father a break. He works, goes to school, cares for three stepchildren. "He got a lot of things to do," Marta said. "I really want to give him some time."
Fear, more than frustration, led Jose Vasquez to sign his daughter over to foster care earlier this year. In fits of rage, his daughter, Tania, would bang her fists on a school desk. She bit classmates, and once even a police officer. Last December, he admitted her to a psychiatric hospital. Then, afraid that the city would take her away after another outburst, Mr. Vasquez said, he agreed to sign her over to foster care. He thought it would be brief, he said, long enough for her to be evaluated.
What made that action all the more incongruous was Mr. Vasquez's record as a father. Five years ago, after neglect charges were filed against the mother of his two children, he fought for custody, taking the children out of foster care. He shuttled them, both mentally retarded, between school, doctor appointments and Medicaid offices almost daily. He lost his job as a carpenter. He held onto them even as they lived in a room in a seedy residential hotel, which was all he could afford.
Last week, Mr. Vasquez appeared in court in a desperate bid to get his daughter back. Tania, now 13 and with a mood disorder and borderline intelligence, has spent the last four months in the Kings County Psychiatric Hospital. She has been on Depakote, an anticonvulsant prescribed for epileptics and people with behavioral disorders. And on his recent visits, Mr. Vasquez said, Tania seemed calmer, eager to come home. But his heart broke, he said, when he saw that her hands were shaking uncontrollably. (Depakote is known to cause tremors.)
"When I saw her shaking like that, I started crying myself," he said, as his son, Jose Jr., born with fetal alcohol syndrome, played quietly outside the courtroom. "I thought she was going to come out all right. I thought by this time, she'd be back home again."
Taking Tania home will be no easy feat. Yet Mr. Vasquez is determined to do so. To make her more comfortable, he has asked his girlfriend and their 8-month-old baby to move out of their Bronx apartment.
But if Tania slips into violent outbursts again, how does he know he will be able to handle her?
"Because I'm her father," Mr. Vasquez said, unable to hold back tears. "I wouldn't like for her to be away forever. I would like to try. She doesn't belong over there. She belongs over here."

Numbers Aside, Jeter Still Measures Up

BYLINE: By BUSTER OLNEY

 BODY:
The competitive, cutting remarks between them are few and always good-natured, Alex Rodriguez says about the conversations with his good friend Derek Jeter. The shortstops are like brothers and even the most loving brothers push each other inherently, the presence of one driving the other.
When the friends talk these days, the Seattle Mariners shortstop could slip in a little dig about power production, if he wanted; he has got a lot of home runs and runs batted in, and Jeter does not. 
 Jeter's numbers for the Yankees are down this year, almost across the board. He received the votes for most valuable player last year, and Rodriguez will this year.
But Rodriguez might be wise to refrain from flaunting his numbers too much, because Jeter could always dredge up the R-word: Rings. Championship rings. Jeter already has three and the Yankees are steadily pursuing a fourth.
"If we win, they can have more home runs and more R.B.I.," Jeter said, referring to Rodriguez and Boston's Nomar Garciaparra, his most celebrated shortstop peers. "As long as I have the rings. That's what you play for. Numbers are great, but you want to put up the numbers that are going to help your team win, and you can help your team win in more ways than hitting home runs and having a lot of R.B.I."
Jeter is not hitting many home runs this year: 12, half of what he hit last year. He has 61 R.B.I., after driving in 102 in 1999. His slugging percentage is .468, down from .552 last year. He made two errors Wednesday to give him 20 for the season; he had 14 last year.
But Jeter is a little like the United States economy: some of the leading indicators might be off, but the Yankees are in first place, he is on a pace to score 124 runs and collect 200 hits, and sometime in the last month of the regular season, he should surpass 1,000 career hits, at age 26.
His numbers are diminished, undoubtedly. And Jeter is thriving.
"The year's not over, but obviously I'd like to be doing better in every category," he said. "But there's been periods, like you have every year, where you don't swing the bat well and you're still able to get some hits, and then I've had some periods where I swung the bat well and haven't gotten hits. So it's been up and down."
Jeter sets statistical goals for himself, and although he won't reveal the numbers he hoped for this year, it is safe to say he wanted to at least match his 1999 numbers for homers and R.B.I. He carried the Yankees in the first half of the 1999 season and finished the year third in the balloting for the league's M.V.P. award. When pitchers jammed him with inside fastballs, he often turned on them and drove them to left-center field or to center, or slammed singles, doubles and homers to right field.
When pitchers jammed him early this year -- following the accepted standard on how to pitch Jeter -- or threw pitches down and away, Jeter often swung aggressively at bad pitches and made a lot of weak outs. His basic hitting philosophy, after all, is to attack always.
Attempting to adjust, Jeter backed away from the plate to cope better with the inside fastballs. He started striding forward at a 45-degree angle, rather than right at the pitcher, and found himself stepping into fastballs and effectively jamming himself. Searching for a solution to this, he took extra batting practice -- and strained an abdominal muscle, an injury that forced him to the disabled list May 12. When he came back a couple of weeks later, Jeter was reluctant to swing hard, lest he cause a more serious injury.
So it is September now and Jeter is not going to match his home run and R.B.I. production of last year. He acknowledged this the other day, sounding completely at ease with that reality.
"My job is to score runs, and that's the bottom line," he said. "I think a lot of times people want to focus on R.B.I. output, but when you're hitting first and second in the lineup, R.B.I. isn't really something that you strive for. Obviously, I'd like to hit more home runs; I think everybody would like to hit more home runs, but, hitting first or second, that's not my job. As long as I'm getting on base, that's what I worry about."
He is batting .324 and in the last three weeks has begun to draw more walks, feeling more comfortable at the plate. But Yankee Manager Joe Torre does not believe there is a statistic that fully defines what Jeter provides -- not home runs, nor R.B.I., nor runs scored.
"His value in the market we play in is hard to fathom," Torre said. "What he does for us is not easy to do. He loves the challenge. He's not affected by everything that goes on around him. He continues to have that fire in his eyes. I've never seen a doubt when I look into his eyes."
Shortly after Brad Radke signed a four-year, $36 million deal to remain with the struggling Minnesota Twins, Torre overheard Jeter's conversation with a teammate. What would that be like, Jeter asked with some wonderment, to play for a team that is not winning, to not know when you were going to win?
The Garciaparra-Rodriguez-Jeter comparisons are built on statistics, the way numbers fueled and fashioned the question of whether Willie or Mickey or The Duke was better in the 1950's.
But Jeter's teammates do not tend to think of him in terms of numbers; they tend to think about what he lends to each day's pursuit of victory -- his energy, the joy he exudes in the depths of the grinding season, his confidence.
"His focus is on winning," said third baseman Scott Brosius, "and when you have that, it sort of makes everything else easy. It takes the pressure off you to achieve numbers."
During a bleak pitching change in Oakland last weekend, Jeter stood on the mound among sullen teammates and suddenly started slapping each of them on the chest with his glove. It was as if he had squirted them playfully with a water pistol, a reminder: Hey, we're playing baseball; this is fun. We're a good team and everything's going to work out.
The closer Mariano Rivera was encased in a jam in the ninth inning Wednesday night, the tying runs on base. Jeter jogged to the mound and began pumping up Rivera.
"Nobody wants to hit against you," Jeter said, forcefully. "Go right at them. They know it's over."
Rivera retired the next two hitters and Jeter shook his hand, grinning at the end of another successful series and road trip. On the other side of the field, Rodriguez retreated into a quiet Seattle clubhouse.

How do you sell a skimpy mink bikini? Call Frankie Avalon.

BYLINE: By Courtney Kane

 BODY:
THE "ladies who lunch" seem to have had their fill of fur coats, so American Legend, the maker of the finest mink coat available, is turning to their daughters to try to convince them that mink is the ultimate luxury item and an absolute fashion must.
To do that, Legend is introducing a print campaign that drops the stodgy studio glamour shots of a sophisticated model clad in a full length mommy-looking mink coat in favor of a sexy young model on the beach posing in versatile mink items including a skimpy mink bikini. 
 "We're not trying to sell grandmom's fur coat any longer," said Edward Brennan, the chief executive of American Legend, which is based in Seattle. "When we decided to relaunch our new vision, we said, 'Now we want to position it from a fashion perspective, keep it totally unexpected and young.' "
After a considerable amount of consumer research, Mr. Brennan said, it is clear that the positioning of the company's fur coats in North America was "not really effective in terms of bringing back young potential consumers." Therefore, he added, "our strategy was all about bringing something to a fashion-forward girl that's modern, exciting, fun and useful."
Instead of focusing on the traditional mink coat, the campaign is focusing on nontraditional mink clothing and accessories with casual chic attitudes, like cropped bolero jackets in various colors, vests, knitted sweaters, fur-trimmed jeans, blankets, headbands, bikinis, hats and purses.
"Our objective is not only to draw consumers' attention to the high fashionability of mink, but also create awareness for Legend the brand," Mr. Brennan said. "It is important that consumers recognize that mink is not a commodity. If they want the very best quality, they need to look for the Legend label."
Legend is designed and sold by J. Mendel on Madison Avenue and through his salon in Bergdorf Goodman. Legend will also be available this month through the company's Web site at www.legendmink.com.
A decade or so ago, furs had fallen out of fashion as the economy dipped and they became associated with spray-paint assaults by animal rights protesters. It was also all the rage for celebrities to lend their faces to ads that stated that they'd rather be naked than wear fur.
In the last couple of years, however, the taboo has lifted somewhat and fur has quietly crept back into the American fashion world, first by showing up in the lines of many top designers on collar trims and accessories. Now it has boldly asserted itself in full-page fashion layouts.
American Legend has had a history of memorable ads that also featured celebrities, taking pro-fur stances, of course. In the 1960's, the company along with the adman Peter Rogers created the long-running campaign "What Becomes a Legend Most" for one of its other trademarks, Blackgama. Those ads featured stars like Lauren Bacall, Bette Davis, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, Rita Hayworth, Lena Horn, Barbra Streisand and many others swathed in fur.
The latest campaign, created by Laspata/DeCaro in New York with billings estimated at $2 million, also features an "it" girl. This time, though, she comes from the fashion world, not Hollywood. The supermodel Frankie Rayder is featured posing on a beach in Malibu, Calif., in a retro satire of 1960's surf movies like "Beach Blanket Bingo" and "How to Stuff a Wild Bikini." And who better to join her for a cameo appearance? The king of those surf movies himself, Frankie Avalon.
"We looked to showcase the brand in the most unexpected light," said Charles DeCaro, creative director at Laspata/DeCaro. "And what could be more unexpected than mink on the beach?
"Obviously with a 'Beach Blanket Bingo' subtext to the campaign, it was sort of a no-brainer to contact someone that was part of that genre, and Frankie Avalon seemed the perfect addition," Mr. DeCaro added. "He was the remaining ingredient that this whole equation needed."
In the ad featuring the two Frankies, they are shown posing in a bit of an awkward embrace. She looks secure and sultry in her $5,500 mink- and-leather bikini and sarong. He is clad in all white, yet not quite sure what to do with himself. As a wink to both Mr. Avalon's film career as well as the famous ad campaign that inspired the Legend brand, Mr. Avalon's white shirt says "What Becomes a Legend Most?"
"We did not want to set out to recreate the Legend campaigns of the past," Mr. DeCaro said. "They were phenomenal and iconic in their genre." But for the new campaign, he continued, "it was much more important to capture the fashion pulse in a very sort of tongue-in-check way." The subtle way that they reintroduced the famous line on Mr. Avalon's T-shirt was "definitely a segue to possible future campaigns," Mr. DeCaro added.
Thirteen other ads feature Ms. Rayder wearing a variety of mink items. One ad shows her wearing a white mink sweater over a daisy bathing suit as she joins four tanned, clean-cut surfers in carrying a surfboard. Another ad features her dancing on the beach with the same models, this time wearing a creamy gold mink bolero over a gold lame bikini top and pants. All the ads have the tagline: "J. Mendel for Legend. American Legend Mink."
"We really wanted to show the diversity of the brand," Mr. DeCaro said. The technology is so much more advanced than it was in the past that mink can now be used in many different ways, including being cut to look like corduroy or even resemble velvet, Mr. DeCaro added.
"It was more important to get that across and definitely reach toward a younger, more hip consumer," he said.
The campaign begins running in the September issues of magazines including Elle, Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, In Style, Nylon, Town & Country, Vanity Fair and Wallpaper. This is the second effort from Laspata/ DeCaro since it was awarded the account in August 1999.
"We intend to position Legend as the very best of the best, so would the average girl be able to go in and buy a beautiful Legend bikini?" Mr. Brennan asked. "I would say no. But, in fact would it interest her to go look at other products that could be affordable and really could be useful today that she is not aware of at the moment? Absolutely yes. And that's the point."

HEADLINE: China's Dysfunctional Public Relations Barrage

BYLINE: By Orville Schell; Orville Schell is dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, and author, most recently, of "Virtual Tibet."

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif.

 BODY:
As Beijing sees it, the reason China's diplomatic and trade relations with the United States don't always go smoothly starts with unfair American press coverage and hostile politicians in Congress. These forces cause Americans to misunderstand China's efforts to keep "the motherland" unified and stable, the thinking goes. Still believing in the efficacy of political propaganda, the Communist Party hopes to change things with the public relations offensive that is currently bringing high-level visitors to the United States: Li Peng, leader of the parliament, and President Jiang Zemin to meetings at the United Nations and Zhao Qizheng, an information minister, to introduce a touring show of exhibits, lectures and events about China.
Beijing would like to garner some positive press before the Senate votes on normal permanent trade relations with China. But there is a larger ailment that this dose of public relations will not cure, and that is Beijing's anachronistic but stubborn tendency to see China's national progress as obstructed by foreign interference. 
 After the Opium Wars in the 19th century the West did, in fact, shamelessly prey on China. Anti-foreignism took root and was confirmed by the Japanese occupation in World War II. It was codified during Mao's revolution as Leninist anti-imperialism. In the fever of today's marketplace such revolutionary ideology has been muted, but China's leaders continue almost automatically to export blame for China's less-than-perfect global relations, obscuring two crucial facts: China is no longer being preyed upon, and the means to solve many of its key international problems are actually in the hands of the government itself.
To continue suggesting that "hostile foreign forces" are the problem in hot spots like Taiwan, Tibet and Hong Kong is a curious abdication of the very sovereign power that Chinese leaders aspire to protect. And externalizing the cause of problems preempts understanding of how Chinese leaders could and should exercise initiative at home on their own.
Old notions of sovereignty are changing, and to gain permanent normal trade status with the United States, coexist successfully in a changed world and win global respect, China needs to look at new ways of relieving tensions. Instead of trooping over to New York to engage in transnational propaganda, its leaders might better serve their country by staying home and seeking ways to reframe its relations, on its own, with both its own constituent parts and the larger world.
Because Chinese economic reform efforts have accomplished so much and because there is now so much to be lost if an international flash point ignites, finding solutions becomes ever more urgent.
Far from losing face, China would gain nothing but world respect and gratitude if, for example, it could see its way to unilaterally renouncing the use of force in the Taiwan Straits and evince more respect for the right of Taiwanese to determine their relationship to the mainland. It would gain similarly if it could grant Tibetans a greater quotient of real autonomy and then encourage the Dalai Lama to return to Lhasa, and if it would permit Hong Kong the political latitude to elect its leaders in a truly democratic manner.
The truth is that most solutions for what internationally bedevils China will not be found in New York because what needs fixing is in Beijing. What China needs is not better global propaganda, but bold new vision and leadership dedicated to recasting the way it imagines itself in the world.
Whether the present leadership is imaginative or strong enough to undertake such a reappraisal is another question. But if talks could be started with the Dalai Lama or the issue of reunification with Taiwan could be deferred until China has become more democratic, China's leaders would have accomplished something to be truly proud of. Moreover, their world stature would soar and they would find that myriad other tensions, around issues like trade arrangements with the United States, would dissolve on their own.

HEADLINE: Is Litigation The Best Way To Tame New Technology?

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK; Adam Liptak is a senior counsel in the legal department of The New York Times Company.

 BODY:
"The growing and dangerous intrusion of this new technology," Jack Valenti said, threatens an entire industry's "economic vitality and future security." Mr. Valenti, the president of the Motion Picture Association of America, was testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, and he was ready for a rhetorical rumble. The new technology, he said, "is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston Strangler is to the woman alone."
It was 1982, and he was talking about videocassette recorders. 
 But the woman in this instance survived, and even flourished. "It is fair to say," declared Charles S. Sims, a lawyer at Proskauer Rose who represents the industry in Internet-related litigations, "that as things worked out, the studios did not lose control of their products" through home taping on VCR's. Indeed, video rental income now rivals box-office receipts.
Still, adaptation was not the industry's first response to the new technology. Its first response was to sue.
Some hear an echo of Mr. Valenti's doom-saying in the entertainment industry's recent lawsuits against Web sites that allow users to swap music and movies and to decrypt DVD's. In July, Marilyn H. Patel, a federal judge in San Francisco, effectively signed a death warrant for Napster, a Web site through which users share music files. Asserting that it had "contributed to illegal copying on a scale that is without precedent," she said: "Any destruction of Napster Inc. by a preliminary injunction is speculative compared to the statistical evidence of massive, unauthorized downloading and uploading of plaintiffs' copyrighted works -- as many as 10,000 files per second, by defendant's own admission."
An appellate court deferred the enforcement of that order until it hears arguments.
Last month Lewis A. Kaplan, a federal judge in New York, forbade Eric Corley, a computer hacker, and his company, which publishes a magazine and maintains a Web site, to post or even provide hyperlinks to sites containing a computer code for decrypting DVD's. Judge Kaplan was unmoved by the general availability of the code on countless Web sites. "If a plaintiff seeks to enjoin a defendant from burning a pasture," he wrote, "it is no answer that there is a wild fire burning in its direction."
Nor was he impressed by the defendants' First Amendment arguments: "The Constitution, after all, is a framework for building a just and democratic society. It is not a suicide pact." He was echoing a similar statement by Justice Robert H. Jackson in a 1949 Supreme Court decision.
Unlike Judges Patel and Kaplan, however, jurists have generally been reluctant to wade into fast-evolving technical issues. Existing law can fit poorly with technological developments, mostly because the legislators who drafted the laws did not anticipate them.
The VCR case, for instance, caused the Supreme Court considerable anguish. The court heard arguments twice, and finally, a year and a half after it had agreed to decide the case, it issued a 5-to-4 decision allowing home taping. The court's uneasiness with the technical aspects of the case was evident in its description of the device under attack. "The pause button, when depressed," Justice John Paul Stevens solemnly found, "deactivates the recorder until it is released."
The only point on which the justices on both sides agreed was that the courts were the wrong forum for regulating technological advances. "Like so many problems created by the interaction of copyright law with a new technology," Justice Harry Blackmun said in dissent, "there can be no really satisfactory solution to the problem here, until Congress acts."
Legal experts have no trouble thinking of similar examples from the past. Susan P. Crawford, who specializes in Internet issues at Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering in Washington, noted the sheet music industry's challenge to the new player piano technology in 1908. The Supreme Court of that era held that perforated paper was not a copy of musical notations for purposes of the copyright law.
While the court observed that the case was "of very considerable importance" because it involved "large property interests" and "the rights of composers and music publishers," it held that existing law did not prohibit the new technology. As in the VCR case, the court said the issue was for Congress to decide.
Ms. Crawford went on to identify what seems to be a recurring theme in the litigation in this area: "The older industry lost."
Legal scholars are sharply divided on whether litigation is the appropriate vehicle for resolving these clashes. Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that judicial resolution of cases like the one against Napster "is what law is all about." He said that "it is a good and acceptable thing if business people address the violation of their legal rights by seeking judicial relief."
He dismissed concerns that Napster or at least its decentralized cousin Gnutella is unstoppable as a practical matter. "It's important not to take a nirvana-or-the-abyss attitude about these things," he said. "Any attempt to enforce the law is going to be imperfect."
Others are warier of judicial intervention. "This is a technology that is enormously exciting, with enormous potential," said David G. Post, a law professor at Temple University, referring not only to Napster but to all file sharing. "It has the potential to fundamentally alter people's relation to information on the Internet."
The legal system, he continued, should "allow this thing to grow and move off into all those new applications and somehow figure out how to compensate those who are harmed."
Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Stanford and the author of "Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace," also questioned the wisdom of a rush to judicial judgment. He told Judge Patel in a report filed at Napster's request that the record companies' "apparent aim is to use the law to fit the Internet into their traditional business model." Mr. Lessig urged the court to act cautiously before attempting "judicial regulation on net architecture."
There are other problems as well. Napster, like the VCR manufacturers before it, is accused of "contributory infringement," a concept invented by judges as a sort of short cut. It allows a single suit against a central facilitator rather than thousands of suits against individual infringers.
"It's almost like a class action," Mr. Post said. And as in class actions, he went on, courts should be concerned about the interests of those not before the court. In the Napster case these absent voices include people who merely retrieve from remote locations music they already own, musicians who welcome the opportunity to distribute their work and even copyright holders who think that sampling will encourage buying.
"The other thing about litigation is that the future is not present either," he said. "The courts are inherently retrospective institutions."
If nothing else, he continued, this much is clear about the future: "The people who will make money are not those saying, 'You're infringing my technology.' The people making money here are those thinking, 'This is a really neat idea.' "

HEADLINE: Mr. Cheney on Defense

 BODY:
Dick Cheney turned up the heat on defense Wednesday with his charge that the Clinton administration had run down the military, leaving it with aging equipment, overextended forces and declining readiness. Those are stinging accusations coming from the man who ran the Pentagon during the Persian Gulf war. But on close examination, many of Mr. Cheney's points seem misleading or exaggerated. America's military forces are the world's strongest and best prepared. To stay that way they must continue adapting to the post-cold-war world, not return to the doctrines and assumptions of a decade or more ago.
Mr. Cheney notes, correctly, that defense spending has fallen to just under 3 percent of national output, the lowest since Pearl Harbor. But in the current booming economy, share of output is less reliable than it used to be as a measure of military strength. Much of the percentage decline Mr. Cheney points to is accounted for by America's remarkable economic growth over the past decade, not miserliness in defense spending. Adjusted for inflation, the United States still spends about 95 percent as much for defense as it did during the cold war, though it now faces sharply reduced threats. 
 When Mr. Cheney talks about overcommitment of American forces, he is referring to United States participation in peacekeeping and peace-enforcement missions, like the NATO-led operations in Bosnia and Kosovo. Although the Bush campaign now says it would begin discussions on scaling back American military forces' participation in the Balkans, the Clinton administration cannot be seriously faulted for joining its main allies in these life-saving interventions.
Peacekeeping is also part of the running debate about readiness. Many of the statistical measures currently used to evaluate readiness look at factors like recent combat experience or training exercises. By those criteria, troops on duty in the Balkans separating militias or helping to rebuild infrastructure are eroding their readiness because they are neither fighting nor conducting exercises. Even so, they are acquiring skills that will be crucial for future missions. American forces need to be battle-ready, rested and properly equipped. But there is no clear agreement today on how combat readiness should be measured and no consensus that United States troops are dangerously unready for action.
America's current aircraft, ships and weapons decisively outperform those of any other country, and many are scheduled for replacement with expensive successors for which there is not yet a visible need. Given this margin of safety, Mr. Cheney is right to suggest diverting a greater share of the procurement budget to research and development. Shifting procurement dollars to spare parts would do even more to improve readiness.
Mr. Cheney comes closer to the mark when he asserts that the Pentagon is straining to meet its own declared standard of being prepared for two simultaneous regional conflicts, on the scale of the Korean and Persian Gulf wars. But that standard is itself dangerously outdated, putting too much emphasis on heavy mechanized army divisions at the expense of the more mobile forces needed for responding to sudden emergencies.
Defense policy ought to be part of the campaign debate, and Mr. Cheney, as a former defense secretary, is well qualified to discuss it. But he needs to do so with more precision and clarity than he managed this week.
On another defense matter that has emerged as a campaign issue, President Clinton made the right call yesterday when he decided to leave it to the next president to decide whether and when to construct a national missile defense. Vice President Al Gore sees a strong case for building a limited missile defense and hopes he can persuade Russia to accept it within the framework of existing arms control treaties. Gov. George W. Bush wants to consider more robust defensive technologies and hopes to deploy an effective missile shield quickly. The president's decision to delay gives them a chance to proceed more carefully in choosing the right system and easing the concerns of Russia, China and America's skeptical NATO allies.
Waiting makes sense because the missile defense technology America has been testing remains unproven and because more time is needed to find ways of constructing missile defenses without overturning the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Russia. Mr. Clinton also rightly deferred plans to award the initial construction contracts for radars in Alaska. Starting work on those radars could have forced Washington to give Moscow the required six months' notice of withdrawal from the ABM treaty.
The Pentagon's recent tests of the prototype interceptor missile have been plagued with failures, and testing the system against realistic decoys still lies ahead. Mr. Clinton serves America wisely by leaving more time for diplomacy and testing.

HEADLINE: U.S. Industry Cooled in August, Purchasing Managers Report

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Manufacturing contracted in August for the first time since January 1999, while price pressures eased, a closely watched industry survey showed today.
The survey supports other data indicating that the economy's torrid growth has been dampened somewhat by six interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management said today that its monthly factory index fell last month to 49.5 from 51.8 in July. Production could slow further in months ahead: the orders index fell to 49.7 from 49.9, the second consecutive month of declining orders. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction of activity.
"Judging from this and the employment report, we are just where the Fed wants us to be," said Christopher Low, chief economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York.
Analysts had expected a 52.3 reading in the overall index. The August index reading was the first below 50 since January 1999 and the lowest since 46.3 in December 1998.
Inflation remained tame. A gauge of prices paid for raw materials fell to 56.2 in August from 61.9, for the lowest reading since 54.6 in July 1999. Analysts had expected the prices paid index to be 60. The Fed watches for signs that manufacturers are passing along higher prices to customers, causing overall inflation to accelerate.
The production index, a gauge of current output, fell to 48.7, the first contraction since December 1998, from 53.4 the previous month. The inventories index fell to 47.8 from 48.4. The backlog of orders rose to 49 from 45.
Manufacturing had been bounding ahead, recovering from a slump in 1998 when Asian countries were barely growing or in recession. Since then recoveries in the region and a record expansion in the United States have kept factories busy, even under with higher borrowing costs.
Mr. Low of First Tennessee said his company expected the purchasers' association index "to stabilize close to these levels, while manufacturing payrolls continue to shrink."
Separately, the Commerce Department reported yesterday that construction spending in July fell for a fourth consecutive month, led by declines in the building of homes, commercial structures and roads.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Giving Theme Parks a Whirl;
Europeans Warm to an American-Style Entertainment

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: DRONTEN, the Netherlands

 BODY:
A paunchy kangaroo used to perch atop the entrance to the old Walibi Flevo theme park here, a red "W" on its sweater for the Walibi Group of Belgium, which ran the park.
The kangaroo is gone now, and the old gate is, too, replaced by a pastel-and-aluminum Art Deco facade, capped with the name Six Flags Holland. On masts nearby flutter the flags of the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Spain and the United States -- the countries where the American owner, Six Flags Inc., operates. 
 It may seem odd that the Dutch and other Europeans, surrounded by glories like the canals of Amsterdam and the museums and churches of Brussels, would flock to an American-style theme park.
But they do. Europeans visited amusement parks in record numbers this summer, stirred by spreading affluence, booming tourism and greater variety. In the last decade the number of theme parks in Europe has increased by a third, to 83 established parks, according to Economics Research Associates, which tracks the industry, while the number of admissions has risen two-thirds, to 101 million, and revenues doubled, to $2.2 billion.
The expansion is gathering momentum and drawing outside investment, notably from the United States, transforming the European industry, long known for family-owned mom-and-pop parks. Last year, Europe's 83 parks averaged about 1.2 million visitors each, far fewer than the 2 million that packed into each of America's 226 parks.
And once inside, Americans were induced into spending an average of $30 a visitor, against $22 in Europe. "Our trans-Atlantic cousins can still teach us a few things," David Camp, an analyst in London for Economics Research Associates, wrote to clients recently.
But as Europeans rush to catch up, the Continent is increasingly luring American park operators who have expertise in design and marketing.
In addition to buying the park and five others in Europe from Walibi in 1998, Six Flags last year acquired Warner Brothers Movie World, in Germany's densely populated Ruhr basin, and another Warner studio park being built outside Madrid. The theme park unit of Universal Studios also acquired control of Spain's biggest park, Port Aventura, on the Costa Dorada near Barcelona. Universal, a part of the Seagram Company, which is being acquired by the French conglomerate Vivendi, has ambitious plans to transform Port Aventura into Europe's No. 2 park after Disneyland Paris.
Not to be outflanked, Disney announced a major expansion last year of its site at Marne-la-Vallee, east of Paris, including a new studio park alongside Disneyland Paris.
European companies are getting into the action, too. Global Family Attractions, the theme park division of Lego System, of Denmark, will open a $138 million theme park south of Munich in 2002. Like Lego's other parks in Denmark, Britain and California, it will be based on Lego blocks. In Spain a $400 million park, Terra Mitica, opened its gates this summer near Alicante in the southeast, and as many as 20 other projects are in the works.
Not that selling Europeans on magic kingdoms and Wild West villages comes easily. In Belgium, laws prevent students from working more than one month a year, so Six Flags continually trains new crops of students for summer jobs. And not every slogan translates well. For a season's-end Halloween festival, Six Flags marketing experts puzzled over whether to call it a Fright Fest, then dropped the name as untranslatable.
Nor is every project an automatic winner. In Spain, investors, including the Ogden Corporation of New York, built a park called Isla Magica on the site of the 1992 Seville world's fair. But Isla Magica ran up nothing but losses after it opened in 1997, a victim of poor marketing and high costs. Last spring, after a consortium of Spanish banks effectively took over Isla Magica, Ogden bailed out and sold its theme park interests to a Greek investor.
Six Flags' strategy in the Netherlands, a kind of pilot project for its European parks, illustrates the impact of fresh investment and aggressive marketing. When the old Walibi park closed in October, Six Flags mobilized hundreds of workers from a dozen countries to complete almost $40 million of improvements, including rides like a 115-foot Ferris wheel, and four additional roller coasters. To generate more spending in the park, Six Flags increased restaurant capacity by 50 percent and installed 20 pushcarts offering snacks.
To draw visitors back, Six Flags introduced a season pass, good at all its parks. To nudge visitors to buy the pass, it increased the single-entry ticket to 41 Dutch gilders, about $17, from 33. The season pass is 160 gilders. Spending for television and radio ads was sharply increased; to draw visitors for events like conventions, weddings and birthday parties, marketing executives fanned out to schools, social clubs and businesses.
"These were good facilities doing a reasonable profit," said Daniel P. Aylward, Six Flags' managing director for Europe. Mr. Aylward, a veteran at turning American parks around, ducks and bobs as he shows a visitor through the park, snatching up litter as he walks. "But there were lots of opportunities for advertising and marketing."
For local politicians and planners, the investments and the jobs are welcome. In the Netherlands, the number of park employees, some of them poorly paid performers, has grown to 700 from 300 in two years. In Madrid, much of the $300 million investment in the new Warner studio park is being borne by regional governments. While Six Flags will manage the park when it opens in 2002, it will have only 5 percent ownership.
Herman Otte, 38, who knew the old Walibi park, drove 60 miles recently from his home north of Amsterdam after hearing about the refurbished Dutch park in a television commercial. "It's more attractive for children, and far larger," he said, as his family made its way to a snack bar from the new Looney Tunes area, where Bugs Bunny and his pals had cavorted in a musical sketch. Earlier, Mr. Otte and his daughter Yanique, 3, had enjoyed the big new Ferris wheel. "She wasn't afraid," he said.
Such visitors cheer executives at Six Flags' American parent, for whom Europe brings the promise of renewed investor favor. After Six Flags, then called Premier Parks, went public in 1996, its share price roughly tripled in two years. The shares have tumbled by 50 percent since the start of the year, though, with analysts citing this summer's bad weather in parts of the United States and a kind of consumer fatigue with leisure and entertainment products.
"They clearly view Europe as a very ripe market to expand their business," said Jill S. Krutick, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. Last month, she cut her recommendation back a notch, to outperform from buy. "In Europe, there's an enormous opportunity to consolidate the market," she said.
Kieran E. Burke, Six Flags' 43-year-old chairman and chief executive, described the thrust into Europe as but one part of a broader international strategy that included Latin America, where Six Flags operates a park outside Mexico City, and Asia, where it is looking for places to invest.
"In many respects," he said, "we are really just getting started," adding that the planned expansion would have "significant ramifications for the value of the company."
In Europe, as in the United States, the Six Flags strategy is to operate regional parks, mostly for nearby day trippers, who often become season ticket holders who might drop into the parks more often, if only for a few hours at a time.
At Universal Studios, by contrast, the goal is to transform Port Aventura, which this season was renamed Universal Studios Port Aventura, into a destination park, perhaps adding a studio park to the existing theme park, as well as hotels and golf courses.
Indeed, Tom Williams, chairman of Universal Studios' theme park group, does not hesitate to say the goal is "to turn this single-gated attraction into a year-round family resort."
Port Aventura, which opened in 1995, packed in three million visitors this year by the end of July, roughly the number it drew in all 1999, when attendance rose 11 percent from the year before. Under Universal's management, Port Aventura this year opened a $30 million submarine ride, Sea Odyssey, and next season plans another blockbuster, Temple of Fire, in which visitors walk through flames. Last year, Port Aventura was employing roughly 3,000 people, generating $85 million in revenue.
Mr. Williams appears to be leading the expansion of Port Aventura into an all-year destination resort along the lines of Universal Studios Escape in Orlando, whose creation he oversaw before taking his current job a year ago. The immediate plans for Spain, he said, involve building two 500-room hotels for occupancy in 2003, with meeting rooms allowing Universal to draw business and convention travelers, focusing on a European market that Disney once had pretty much to itself. Unlike Paris, with its cool and cloudy climate, Barcelona, much like Orlando, boasts 300 days of sunshine a year and average temperatures of 72 degrees. Indeed, the city was the runner-up to Paris when Disney chose the location for its European park in 1985.
For the moment, the 7 million annual admissions at the Six Flags parks in Europe are little more than half the 12.5 million Disneyland Paris packed in last year, and Disney is hardly in danger of losing its leadership position. Last year, Disney, which owns 39 percent of the company that runs Disneyland Paris, announced plans for a new $615 million 62-acre park that will focus on film studios, animation and television.
James Rasulo, the 15-year Disney veteran who is chief executive of the French unit, Euro Disney, said attendance at the site should rise from 12.5 million visitors last year to 17.5 million when the new park opens in April 2002. To accommodate the increase, Disney is negotiating with tour operators and hotel management companies to build new hotels with a total of 1,500 rooms, to add to the six hotels with 5,160 rooms it now operates.
Mr. Rasulo says the pattern in Europe apes that in America. Improvements in the design and management of regional parks are lifting the image of theme parks generally, ultimately benefiting the market leader, Disney.
"Most of these guys are mimicking us, in the layout of their parks, in the handling of people," he said. "It's exactly the pattern you had in the United States: more professionalism, and that drove more business."

HEADLINE: Latin Leaders Rebuff Call By Clinton On Colombia

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The presidents of South America's 12 countries today rebuffed President Clinton's appeal, made earlier this week, that they endorse a new American-backed military and police offensive aimed at drug trafficking and guerrilla groups in Colombia.
In a joint declaration at the end of a two-day summit meeting here, the leaders expressed support for efforts by Colombia's president, Andres Pastrana, to negotiate an end to four decades of civil conflict there. 
 But they pointedly omitted any mention of Mr. Pastrana's plan to use military means to weaken the cocaine cartels and the left-wing guerrilla and right-wing death squads that are allied with them.
Asked at a news conference about the deepening political and military crisis in Colombia, President Ricardo Lagos of Chile made the distinction explicit. The presidents fully support "the peace process, which implies negotiations," he said, and which is therefore "distinct from the problem of narcotics trafficking."
During his visit to Colombia on Wednesday, Mr. Clinton urged that country's neighbors to "be strongly supportive of President Pastrana and Plan Colombia," a comprehensive $7.5 billion package whose military component is largely supplied by the United States.
Mr. Clinton acknowledged that increased American aid to counter-narcotics operations in Colombia, if successful, was likely to "cause the problem to spill over the borders" into neighboring countries like Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. But he also said the United States was willing to provide "a substantial amount of money to help other countries deal with those problems at the border when they start," an offer that has received no reply.
Looming over the meeting here was concern at what Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, described as the threat of "the Vietnamization of the entire Amazon region" as a result of increased American support for Colombia. From the moment he arrived here, Mr. Pastrana sought both to refute such notions and to enlist his colleagues in a regional counter-narcotics campaign.
"There is no cause for fear, because after all we are fighting a common enemy," he told reporters this morning after a meeting with Mr. Chavez. "Drug trafficking is an enemy of Brazil, of Colombia, of Peru, of the United States, and so we have to work hand in hand."
Mr. Pastrana's assurances, however, have been greeted with skepticism, if not by his fellow regional leaders, then certainly in the press and by public opinion across the continent. This afternoon, Colombia's foreign minister, Guillermo Fernandez de Soto, vented his government's frustration in remarks to reporters.
"It is unjust and counterintuitive that Colombia's efforts to strengthen itself to fight the threat it faces are the subject of complaints when no one criticizes the arms buildup of the insurgents," he said. "We want cooperation, not unfair criticism."
But Mr. Chavez, a former Venezuelan Army colonel who has often expressed sympathy for the guerrillas, made it clear, in terms that several other governments echoed privately, that regional cooperation was going to have important qualifications. "We support Plan Colombia so long as it does not generate combat activities that could complicate our situation," he said.
In other public comments, Mr. Chavez floated the idea of organizing what he describes as a South American version of the NATO military alliance. But in an interview in August, Brazil's foreign minister, Luiz Felipe Lampreia, in effect quashed the idea, which would be stillborn without Brazil's participation.
"We haven't exactly had that thought or even discussed it within Mercosur," Mr. Lampreia said, referring to the trade bloc that Brazil helped to found. "Mercosur is a group whose purpose is clearly established, and it does not aspire to be a military bloc or alliance."
The summit meeting here was a Brazilian initiative drawn up this year and initially intended to focus on issues of economics, trade and infrastructure.
But the United States' recent decision to provide $1.3 billion in emergency aid to Mr. Pastrana, combined with Mr. Clinton's visit to Cartagena, Colombia, on Wednesday, forced an unexpected reordering of priorities.
Nevertheless, the South American presidents agreed to begin negotiations aimed at fusing the continent's two main trading groups. The Mercosur group is led by Brazil and also includes Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, while the Andean Community is made up of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.
The objective established here is to create a single free trade group, ideally by the beginning of 2002. That achieved, South America would be able to present a common front in negotiations with the North American Free Trade Agreement group, whose members are the United States, Mexico and Canada, over a hemispheric trade accord the United States wants in place by 2005.
The presidents also approved a so-called democracy clause that would expel from their ranks any government that takes power through a coup or other nondemocratic means. It was signed by all 12 presidents.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE DEMOCRATS;
Lieberman Returns Home and Attacks Bush's Drug Plan

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman returned to the warm embrace of his hometown today, where he criticized Gov. George W. Bush, telling a group of older residents that Mr. Bush would do nothing to strengthen Medicare.
Mr. Lieberman, joined by family members, was welcomed like a returning son to the Bella Vista retirement home here as he made his first swing through Connecticut since accepting the nomination as the Democratic vice-presidential candidate. 
 Looking drawn at the end of a six-day, cross-country campaign trip, Mr. Lieberman hoisted his 3-year-old granddaughter, Tennessee, onto his hip -- the first time in weeks he had seen her. He kissed her cheek and said, "This is what I missed."
Millie Shea, 76, kissed the senator's cheek, shook his hand and then said: "I'm praying for you all the time. I know God is with you."
Mary Casotti, 82, told him that when he was nominated, "I nearly fainted with joy."
To the knowing nods of some 300 residents who crowded into a sweltering community room, Mr. Lieberman talked of meeting a retired veteran this week in Portland, Ore., who must spend a third of his income on medication.
"That's unacceptable," Mr. Lieberman said. "In the greatest country in the world, at the time of our greatest prosperity in history, no one in this generation in particular, who survived the Depression, fought the Second World War, should have to face poverty to take the medicine that your doctors tell you you're supposed to take to stay well."
He praised Mr. Gore's proposal to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, at a cost of more than $250 billion over 10 years, and to set aside some of the federal budget surplus to extend Medicare's solvency.
"Our opponents can't do it because they won't have any money left after they've given it all away in a big tax cut" that benefits mostly the wealthy, he said.
And he cited the words of a Republican, Senator John McCain of Arizona, who criticized Mr. Bush's fiscal plan during the primaries.
"He said the Bush plan doesn't have one penny for Social Security, one penny for Medicare or one penny to pay down the debt," Mr. Lieberman said. "He was right when he said it earlier this year, he's right today and he'll be right on Election Day."
Mr. Bush said last week that he would propose a prescription drug plan under Medicare this week, and he has argued that the surplus would be large enough to accommodate that goal and his tax cuts.
"Senator Lieberman has his facts all wrong," said Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush. "Governor Bush dedicates 240 trillion pennies to Medicare. His budget doubles Medicare funding over the next 10 years."
The governor's tax cut, Mr. Bartlett said, "is not only within the budget, it's good economic policy."
Mr. Bush has proposed an across-the-board tax cut that would total $1.3 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Gore has proposed a more modest $500 billion package of tax cuts singling out specific areas, like college tuition, child care and care for the elderly.
The vice president has proposed using the rest of the projected budget surplus to shore up Social Security and Medicare, the health insurance program for the poor, and to pay down the national debt.
Though he is popular among voters in Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman's visit came with a hint of controversy. He is running not only for vice president but also for a third term in the Senate, which would leave the seat in Republican hands if he and Mr. Gore win because Connecticut's governor, a Republican, would appoint his replacement.
That has caused some grumbling among Connecticut Democrats, though most insisted publicly that they supported his decision. On Thursday, the Connecticut secretary of the state, Susan Bysiewicz, a Democrat, said in an interview on WVIT-TV that Mr. Lieberman should give up his Senate seat.
Mr. Lieberman had said for weeks that he expected to run for re-election, and his aides have said it more forcefully. But it was not until Thursday night that the senator himself said definitively, "I'm staying in the race."
Connecticut is one of a handful of states that allows a senator to run simultaneously for re-election and for national office, and his decision is not without precedent. Lloyd M. Bentsen, in 1988, and Lyndon B. Johnson, in 1960, both Texas Democrats, ran for re-election to the Senate while also running for vice president.
But if the Democrats hold onto the White House, Mr. Lieberman would have to give up his Senate seat, and Gov. John G. Rowland would appoint his replacement. Republicans hold a 54-to-46 advantage in the Senate, and the loss of Mr. Lieberman's seat would hurt the Democrats' slim chances of taking control.
If Mr. Lieberman quit the Senate race, officials in both parties said, any number of prominent Democrats, including Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, could step in and defeat the Republican nominee, Phillip A. Giordano, mayor of Waterbury.
Mr. Blumenthal said today that he agreed with Mr. Lieberman's decision. "I believe it is absolutely the right decision for the citizens of Connecticut," he said.
Mr. Lieberman said that at this late date, the selection of a candidate to replace him would be made by party leaders and not by voters, and he argued that the process would be undemocratic.
Mr. Lieberman began his day with a $1,000-per-person fund-raiser in Portland, Me., where he warned for the first time of the threat posed by Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for president.
"A vote for Nader is a vote for Bush," he told about 15 contributors. But he noted of Mr. Nader's standing in the polls, "I wouldn't say it has collapsed." Most polls have Mr. Nader with about 3 percent of the vote.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Life Change for A.C.L.U. Chief. Not That Words Fail Him.

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
FINALLY, Ira Glasser clams up. For several entire nanoseconds, he is embarrassed and fumbling for words.
He has waxed on for three hours, impossible to turn off, a logorrheic torrent full of aggressive pride about the people he associates with professionally: skinheads, Nazis, pornographers, fascists, Communists and any additional species of -ists that might offend the public. 
 No question has come close to wobbling him. Did he suppress the free-speech rights of his children? Is it awkward for a nice Jewish guy from New York City to sit down with neo-Nazis? Does he ever defend nice people? It is hard enough to get a question in, and he grabs each one -- almost literally, his arms flailing over his desk -- and answers it easily, with the calm assurance of a major league hitter facing a Little League pitcher.
Then he is asked a question that stops him: Where is his computer? The rush of words halts, and for an eighth of an instant he has no idea what to say. "You have discovered my Luddite secret," Mr. Glasser admits. Ruefully, he picks up a pen in one hand and a yellow pad in the other and explains that he uses them rather than a computer, adding: "They never crash. They never get viruses."
Mr. Glasser, who is 62, has ushered the American Civil Liberties Union into the new century, helping to transform it in his 22 years as executive director, and yet, it turns out, he left himself behind, at least in technological terms. But he will have time to catch up and get his first cell phone and desktop computer, for the A.C.L.U. will announce next week that he is retiring on July 1.
The retirement will be a milestone for the 300,000-member organization, and a nationwide search for a successor is already beginning. But one of Mr. Glasser's legacies is that after having taken over at a time of financial crisis, in the aftermath of the group's defense of the right of Nazis to march in the heavily Jewish community of Skokie, Ill., he leaves a smoothly running, financially strong organization that he says (with the faintest hint of regret) will get along just fine without him.
Colleagues say Mr. Glasser, for all his own lack of intimacy with anything more technical than a pen and paper, will be remembered as a modernizer -- as a 1960's rebel who turned himself into a fund-raiser, manager and chief executive and who turned the civil liberties union from a chaotic group of young lawyers in threadbare offices with pizza crusts lurking under broken chairs into a quasi corporation whose 18th-floor headquarters in Lower Manhattan have the hushed feel of a law firm.
"Ira Glasser changed," mused Samuel Walker, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska who is the author of a history of the A.C.L.U. "He was an issue-driven person, and never in his wildest dreams -- or nightmares -- would he have thought of becoming a manager. Now he can talk to you about mailings and their response rates for two hours."
Mr. Glasser plans to devote his retirement not to grand new crusades but to family, basketball and beaches. In a fund-raiser recently, family members bought him the opportunity to play one-on-one for 10 minutes with the former Knick Walt Frazier -- and he nearly bursts with pride as he relates that the game ended in a tie, 12-12.
MR. GLASSER, born and raised in New York City, was an odd leader for the A.C.L.U., in that he never studied law; until diverted by the 1960's, he was a math professor at Queens College and Sarah Lawrence. It was good training: of all the audiences he has faced, he says, none have been so hostile as college students in required freshman calculus. (In budget meetings at the A.C.L.U., Mr. Glasser shows off his math skill by calculating sums faster in his head than people around him with a calculator.)
Mr. Glasser joined the civil liberties union's New York affiliate in 1967 and ever since has been energetically defending the rights of people to express sentiments that he abhors. One fond moment came in 1968, when George C. Wallace, whose segregationist views were the opposite of Mr. Glasser's, was running for president and was denied use of Shea Stadium to hold a rally. Mr. Glasser went to meet Mr. Wallace's lieutenants and introduced them to the lawyer he had arranged to defend their right to use the stadium: Eleanor Holmes Norton, a black woman who is now the District of Columbia's delegate to the House of Representatives.
Nadine Strossen, the law professor who serves as A.C.L.U. president, a nonmanagerial position, said Mr. Glasser's greatest legacy was to have helped forge the group into a truly nationwide organization, with 53 offices around the country. Another of his legacies, one that annoyed some members, is that he developed a broader agenda that in addition to the organization's longtime emphasis on free speech underscores gay rights, legalized abortion, affirmative action, free expression on the Internet and hostility to racial profiling. In addition, he has put less emphasis on litigation and much more on cultivating public opinion.
Yet even if Mr. Glasser is not a lawyer and has helped move the A.C.L.U. away from its traditional focus on the courts, callers trying to reach him around midday are sometimes told that he is away because of "a very important court appointment."
That means he is off playing basketball.

HEADLINE: At a U.N. 'Summit,' Lawmakers Urge Stronger Legislative Bodies

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 1

 BODY:
With many new democracies and some old ones under strain because of economic setbacks, rebellions and unsatisfactory political leadership, lawmakers from around the world have spent the last three days urging one another to make legislative bodies at every level of government stronger institutions.
The lawmakers were part of the first "summit" meeting of more than 150 presiding officers of the world's legislatures, an event that leaders of the United States Congress chose not to attend. Throughout the conference, the speakers, who for the most part were elected by grass-roots constituencies, repeatedly addressed the question of how to give their voters a more direct sense of involvement in national policymaking. 
 Speakers of both lower and upper houses of parliament at the conference, organized by the Geneva-based Inter-Parliamentary Union, said that in an era of globalization, ordinary people often seemed to feel that political and economic power was moving farther away from them, even in established democracies.
"If there is one broad, general trend discernible at this critical juncture of world history," said Bichai Rattakul, speaker of the Thailand House of Representatives, "it must surely be the awakening of the people, the common man, from rich and poor nations alike, who are now clamoring and positioning themselves to have more say in the determination of their livelihoods and well being, and demanding more transparency in the execution of the affairs of state."
Sir Ramesh Jeewoolall, speaker of the National Assembly of Mauritius, took the argument a step further. "Let us remind ourselves," he told his fellow legislative leaders, "democracy carries with it the idea of free debate of issues, as well as free choice of a legislative body, which has the sole power to legislate on behalf of the people."
But he also cautioned against allowing legislatures to become too parochial.
Worldwide, democratically elected legislatures share some growing problems, some speakers said. G. M. C. Balayogi, speaker of the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, catalogued the concerns as "the growth of the executive, disproportionate to the oversight functions of parliaments; the growing influence of power-brokering groups and lobbies; the nexus in some societies between politics, bureaucracy, business and crimes; and the declining probity and standards in public life."
The point was brought home by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, president of the Cambodian National Assembly, who clings to his political space through his legislative title against a strong central government that has tried to crush most political opponents. In his speech, Prince Ranariddh pleaded for stronger support from a range of civic organizations and the media.
Working together, parliaments could play a larger part in correcting political abuses, said Luciano Violante, president of the Chamber of Deputies in Italy.
"Parliaments should champion respect for and implementation of the U.N. conventions on international humanitarian law," he said.
"I think the time is right," Mr. Violante said, "for a concise charter of the duties of states, which could initially represent a purely moral restraint against inhumane treatment and for the protection of all minorities, against corruption and for assigning a reasonable share of public resources to the eradication of poverty, and for education and health care."
In an age of special interests, said Raymond Forni, speaker of the National Assembly of France, the role of promoting citizens' causes should not be left to nongovernmental organizations, however welcome a phenomenon they are in most places.
Although the United States is a founding member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, it has not paid its dues since 1996. The United States was criticized not only for its absence, but also because Washington had denied visas to two national speakers, from Cuba and Yugoslavia.
That decision, a statement from the union president, Dr. Najma Heptulla of India's upper house, said, "is all the more regrettable in that it has occurred on the occasion of this historic parliamentary summit."

Now, Joe Hill Would Have Carpal Tunnel

BYLINE: By Clyde Haberman

 BODY:
SO Labor Day is upon us, a good time to play those rousing union songs about the steel-driving John Henry and the scabbing Casey Jones and the martyred Joe Hill, who I dreamed I saw last night, alive as you and me.
Hang on hang on hang on. 
 Great as they are, those numbers have more whiskers than your granddaddy. Where are the new labor tunes? Where are the lyrics that speak to a micro-chipped, dot-commed, cell-phoned, video-crazed, Starbucks-bloated world?
Funny you should ask, because it turns out that there has been a flowering of musical creativity in recent years, inspired by issues like globalization, child labor, downsizing, safety in the work place and jobs heading south thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement. These songs may not have a mass market, but they are around.
"I would say that nowadays, you probably get more singing than was ever done except maybe in the days of the Wobblies," said Joe Glazer. He is known in union circles as "labor's troubadour," having written and performed songs about workers since the 1940's.
Mr. Glazer is chairman of the Labor Heritage Foundation, a group based in Washington that supports the union movement through the arts. The foundation's executive director, Peter Jones, said college campuses are especially friendly territory for today's songwriters. There, you find many who agree that "society is being divided into the super-rich and those having trouble getting past the minimum wage," Mr. Jones said.
What are the new songs about? Not Harlan County coal miners, that's for sure. Try repetitive stress injuries.
Physical pain in the meat-packing industry inspired John O'Connor, an organizer for the New York State Nurses Association, to come up with a number called "Carpal Tunnel." It starts like this:
"Early in the morning at the start of the day/I force my fingers 'round the handle of the blade/I start to cuttin' just as fast as I can/By the end of the day, I can hardly move my hands."
Another New Yorker, Bev Grant, wrote "No Sweat" with Pat Humphries. You get the point right away: "We sew the clothes/ The ones that you buy/We can't afford them for ourselves/The price is too high."
And Kirk Kelly, who performed the other day for striking workers at the Museum of Modern Art, has a song called "Service Economy."
"We sweated and we bled, but the jobs we knew have fled/And the workers never got what we deserved," it goes. "Now that you are done, the factories don't run/And the nation doesn't build, it serves."
What many new songs have in common with those of yesteryear is sympathy with those who endure "tedium on the job," Mr. O'Connor said.
"Nothing much has changed," he said. "Maybe you don't strain your back so much now, but you get carpal tunnel syndrome instead. It's the same old song."
Mr. Kelly's take was this: "The exploitation is the same. And the way you build a union is the same. And the reason you build it is the same. It's all about human rights."
The trick, Ms. Grant said, is to move people to anger, or to tears, while steering clear of lyrics that sound as if cribbed from a pamphlet.
"First person is always good," she said. "One of my strengths is that I do work. And I've been on welfare, and grew up poor. So I have enough experience to enrich my writing."
Some writers prefer original scores. But melding new words with familiar tunes is a tried-and-true technique to get juices flowing on the picket line. It goes at least as far back as the great labor anthem "Solidarity Forever," written in 1915 to the melody of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic."
Remember "Stand By Me"? Think of its opening notes accompanying this offering from Julie McCall: "When the boss calls me in/And the ax is about to fall/And the pink slip is all that I can see/I'm not afraid, no I'm not afraid/'Cause I know the union stands by me."
If you know "After Midnight," you can sing this by Mark Levy: "Afta Nafta, we gonna let your job go down/We gonna import cheaper labor/Send this plant to our southern neighbor/That is what this treaty's all about."
It is enough to inspire an amateur to try his own hand at this craft. How about an update of the classic "Union Maid"?
"Oh you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union/I'm sticking to the union, till the day I die/Or till the boss offers me stock options or better health benefits or an I.P.O."
On second thought, maybe the act needs more work.

Soapbox Orators Stretch the Limits of Democracy

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Late at night, when he hoped nobody was looking, Ong Chin Guan said, he scouted the scene and hid an old wooden drawer in the bushes. He had already told his boss he would not be coming to work today. And he had whispered his plans to a few trusted friends.
"After that, all my friends kept a distance from me," said Mr. Ong, 38, who drives a bus for a living. "They didn't call me the whole week. Most of my friends, they were afraid." 
 But Mr. Ong was undaunted. When the sun came up this morning, he pulled his old drawer from the bushes, placed it squarely in the center of Hong Lim Park, climbed up onto it and began to speak.
His subject was the declining birthrate in Singapore, but that didn't really matter, even to Mr. Ong. What mattered was that -- trembling a little and smiling nervously -- he had become one of the first citizens of Singapore to speak out legally in public without a permit.
All day long, as the sun grew hot, then faded again on the other side of the tiny park, more men climbed onto stools, benches and plastic milk crates to speak their minds and inaugurate Singapore's new experiment in free speech: Speakers' Corner.
Some spoke about the issues of the day as small clumps of people listened: high government salaries, low birthrates, immigration and, yes, free speech. Some shared with the public their personal grievances: a contract dispute, a delayed pension payment, an irritating son-in-law.
All knew they were making history.
"I came because I feel proud to be a Singaporean," said Mr. Ong, who described himself as "just a man in the street, a Tom, Dick and Harry."
"We are really opening up," he said. "We are globalizing. And now we are one of the few countries in the world to have a Speakers' Corner. Do you have a Speakers' Corner in America?"
Indeed, there may not be another public forum quite like the one in Singapore. From now on, it is to be open every day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., but only to people who show their identification cards and register first with the police. Their names are posted on the police station wall and will remain on file for five years.
The speakers are not to use megaphones or microphones or musical instruments -- though they are free to bring their own boxes to stand on -- and they are not to touch on sensitive issues of race, language or religion.
And they must watch what they say. Speakers here will be subject, just like everybody else, to the Internal Security Act, under which they can be jailed without trial as threats to national security, and to the laws against libel and slander that have been vigorously employed in Singapore to harass and bankrupt opposition politicians.
Like Mr. Ong and his timorous friends, speakers here must also combat one of the strongest weapons Singapore uses to keep its people quiet: self-censorship.
In a poll conducted last month by the Chinese-language newspaper Lianhe Zaobao, 9 out of 10 people said that if they disagreed with any government policies they would not say so in public. One-third said they wouldn't even tell their family and friends.
"My friends see the opposition politicians prosecuted and they are afraid," Mr. Ong said. "After I come here maybe they will say, 'Wow, you can speak and nothing happened to you!' "
Free speech is a difficult issue for Singapore, a tiny, multi-ethnic city-state of four million people that sees itself as a sort of gravity-defying bumble bee -- surviving and succeeding through sheer force of effort and inventiveness.
To muffle any ethnic conflicts and build its resource-poor economy, it has chosen the path of tight government controls on just about everything, from financial investment to artistic expression to chewing gum, which is forbidden.
At the heart of these controls are laws and regulations that include censorship of film, television, publications, music and the arts. Access to the Internet is controlled, and home television satellite antennas are banned.
The government controls the only television network and the only newspaper publishing house.
And if Mr. Ong had wanted to speak out in public before today -- or if he wished to speak today in any place other than Hong Lim Park -- he would need a special, hard-to-get permit from the police.
Last year, an opposition politician, Chee Soon Juan, was jailed twice for speaking in public without a permit. Among the things he said: "It's time to break the atmosphere of fear, to say it's all right to criticize the government, to hold it accountable for its actions."
In fact, the divide between the government and its critics is not a wide one in Singapore. Even dissidents like Mr. Chee acknowledge that the ruling party is responsible for the nation's success and prosperity and seek only careful, incremental changes.
And even the country's rulers -- who hold 81 of the 83 seats in Parliament -- acknowledge that Singapore must loosen up and lighten up in order to stay on the crest of an ever-faster-moving and more flexible economic future.
And so, in their Singaporean way, they are trying to mandate (and calibrate) free speech, artistic expression, creativity and risk-taking.
"In the next decade, we need to think and act like revolutionaries," said Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in his National Day speech last month. "We have to change national and individual mind-sets and attune them to a very different future."
The future will not be kind to people and nations that play safe, as Singapore has come to do, he said. The nation and its leaders will need a change of mind-set every bit as daunting as the one Mr. Ong had to undergo when he dragged his wooden drawer out of the bushes and climbed onto it this morning to speak.
Even some of those who acknowledge the need for more free expression -- like Singapore's creator, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew -- find it a bit distasteful.
"I mean, crazy artistes or crazy painters or playwrights who write trash and pretend that it's art -- we'll just have to put up with it," he said not long ago.
And the authorities will have to put up with Bellamy Cai, 54, a graphic designer, who stood on a stool at Speakers' Corner today, waved the morning's newspaper and declared, "What they do in Parliament, they never fight for the bloody issues."
Or Antonio Rio, 67, a former prison guard unhappy with his pension who complained: "I wrote to the prime minister in June but no reply! No reply! No courtesy at all."
Or Richard Kwek, also 67, a taxi driver, who offered what sounded like his usual monologue about government misdeeds for free today -- no meter ticking -- and asserted, "Taxi drivers are 70 percent against the government."
They will have to contend, too, with a new generation of political activists who are already working for more openness. One of these is James Gomez, 35, who recently self-published -- and got away with it -- a slim book called "Self Censorship: Singapore's Shame."
Mr. Gomez arrived today at Speakers' Corner as the shadows were lengthening in the late afternoon, bringing with him several even younger idealists who are helping him create an on-line discussion network called Think Center.
"While we celebrate Speakers' Corner as a psychological lightening of the restrictions on free speech, let's keep it in perspective," Mr. Gomez said. "What we need is more opposition in Parliament, a repeal of restrictions on free speech, more independent institutions."
But in the meantime, he said, he was happy to accept any opening the government provides.
"Let's come here and exercise our right to free speech," he said, "and get over our fear of public speaking."

Umpires Reach a New Agreement, but the Deal Leaves 22 Uncovered

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Without so much as a threat of a work stoppage, the new umpires' union has negotiated a new five-year labor agreement and has apparently forged a new relationship with Major League Baseball.
"I regard it to be a very positive agreement for both sides," Rob Manfred, baseball's chief labor relations executive, said yesterday. "It really lays the foundation for a real good, solid working relationship with this union, something we haven't had in a long time." 
 Late Thursday night, representatives for baseball and the World Umpires Association completed work on the agreement, which must be ratified by the umpires and the club owners, after an intense week of talks at baseball offices in Manhattan.
The agreement, the first negotiated for umpires by someone other than Richie Phillips, the ousted leader of the former union, does not cover the 22 umpires who lost their jobs a year ago today as a result of Phillips's failed resignation strategy.
Negotiators for the new union had worked out a settlement under which 10 to 13 of the umpires would have regained their jobs as part of the new agreement and the others would have received retirement or severance packages.
But the unemployed umpires rejected the plan, preferring instead to await the outcome of their arbitration hearing, most likely later this year. The umpires would have had to withdraw their grievance under terms of the proposed settlement.
 The new agreement includes two elements that are new to umpires' labor contracts: an annual escalation in pay and a neutral fact-finder for disciplinary cases.
In past agreements, the negotiated pay scale remained in place for the life of the deal. In the new agreement, salaries will rise each year. Details were not disclosed in the announcement of the agreement, but one person with knowledge of it said the salary of the most senior umpires would rise from $225,000 in the contract that expired last Dec. 31 to about $250,000 for this year and on to about $340,000 in the fifth year, 2004.
The establishment of a neutral fact-finder gives the umpires some recourse if they are fired, suspended for more than seven days or fined more than $2,000. Although not on the same level as the impartial arbitrator who decides player challenges to disciplinary action, the fact-finder will determine the underlying facts in a disputed case and report them to a baseball official.
Findings on dismissals will go to Commissioner Bud Selig and findings on suspensions and fines will go to Sandy Alderson, executive vice president for baseball operations.
Selig and Alderson will then decide whether the dismissal or discipline was justified. The union had sought the adoption of the arbitration system but settled for the fact-finder.
A labor expert not involved in the negotiations said a fact-finder is a "fairly standard device where you can't get independent arbitration but want to get a neutral view." The system can be especially helpful to the umpires, the labor expert said, because the findings become public.
"If the facts are different than stated," the person said, "it would be hard to uphold the disciplinary action."
The agreement, the result of six months of negotiations, also includes the creation of a joint committee to establish a new system of training umpires and evaluating them when they work in the major leagues. Evaluation has long been a sore practice with umpires.
"It's been a long process," John Hirschbeck, the union president, said. "But with the outcome I couldn't be happier for the profession, for all umpires and the working relationship we've established with Major League Baseball."
Hirschbeck and the union's other top officials, Joe Brinkman and Tim Welke, were joined in negotiations by two lawyers, Joel Smith and Larry Gibson.
Hirschbeck and Brinkman led the group of umpires who worked to oust Phillips and the Major League Umpires Association and install a new union. The new union prevailed in a vote conducted last January by the New York office of the National Labor Relations Board.

Formerly Known as Prince

BYLINE: By Jonathan Mahler; Jonathan Mahler is a senior writer and editor for Talk magazine.

 BODY:
Riding the subway home late one night this summer, I looked up from my newspaper and noticed a man in a fedora and a dark pinstriped suit -- it was dirty and frayed, but recently pressed. He was lost in a slender, well-worn paperback adorned with a familiar etching. It was NiccolRated R Machiavelli, peering out from the cover of his most famous work, "The Prince."
Anyone who has ever taken Government 101 would recognize this portrait: the black frock with the thin red collar; the smooth, peach-colored skin; the closely cropped brown hair descending into a dramatic widow's peak above the forehead; and finally, that mouth, curling up into what looks like a smirk. 
 Until recently, this diminutive Italian philosopher (1469-1527) had little to smile about. Underappreciated during his lifetime, Machiavelli never got to see "The Prince" in print. When the book was posthumously published, a prominent English bishop claimed that it had been inspired by the Devil. Our founding fathers demonized the book as well, wrinkling their puritanical noses at its instructions for good governing. For much of the 20th century, American politicians invoked his name to impugn a rival's character. But those were different times: the Machiavellian Moment is now upon us.
Simply type his name into Amazon.com and you'll discover a whole trove of Machiavelliana. There's Harriet Rubin's book "The Princessa: Machiavelli for Women," written for a new generation of feminists -- Why fight like Machiavelli," Rubin asks, "when we can fight like Machiavella?" -- and Machiavelli for precocious kids. "A Child's Machiavelli: A Primer on Power" (alas, "The Little Prince" was taken) certainly looks like a children's book, with its cuddly illustrations of Peter Rabbit, but Claudia Hart's text doesn't quite conform: "Either be really nice to people or kill 'em," the author writes, and adds, "A gun is man's best friend." Put that .22 away until you've finished your homework, young man!
In the field of politics, there's Michael A. Ledeen's "Machiavelli on Modern Leadership," a conservative rehabilitation of Machiavelli arguing that his hard-headed realism is exactly what America needs now. On the other end of the ideological spectrum is "The New Prince: Machiavelli Updated for the Twenty-first Century," which claims that Machiavelli would have counseled today's politicians to simply follow the polls. The cover of "The New Prince" describes its author as Machiavelli's "modern equivalent" -- yes, it's Clinton's erstwhile consigliere, Dick Morris.
Then there's Machiavelli as self-help guru for hapless middle managers: "What Would Machiavelli Do? The Ends Justify the Meanness," described to me by its author, Stanley Bing, as "a how-to book for people who are insufficiently unkind." This fall will yield yet another book, a biography by a professor of politics at Princeton, Maurizio Viroli. Viroli assumes a radically different task: to humanize his subject. His Machiavelli is the ultimate patriot, a man whose principal concern was the freedom of his beloved Florence.
The Machiavelli industry hasn't simply domesticated the late philosopher, it has democratized him too. He's become an icon for the oppressed. The rapper Tupac Shakur recorded a CD under the name "Makaveli," and Mike Tyson studied Machiavelli while in prison.
So what is it, exactly, about 21st-century America that seems to be calling us back to Renaissance Italy? The theories that Machiavelli gave voice to in "The Prince" began germinating during his years as Florence's defense secretary. At the time, Florence was in a precarious place, caught in the middle of regional warfare between the papal states, Spain, Venice, France and the Holy Roman Empire. As the Florentine Republic's chief emissary, Machiavelli spent his days galloping from one far-flung palace to the next, attempting (usually in vain) to negotiate agreements that would keep his homeland, which at the time had no organized militia, independent.
It was, in short, a difficult time to be a prince. Today's commanders in chief can relate. After all, what's the value of military supremacy when a few casualties will turn public opinion against you? The modern president faces meddlesome news media, an aggressively partisan Congress and a public that is hostile to regulation -- a problem Machiavelli cleverly anticipated when he declared that there are two kinds of people: those who want to rule, and those who don't want to be ruled. (Consider its modern-day echo: the era of big government is over.)
Machiavelli also understood the value of spin. A prince, he wrote, must not actually be religious, but he must be able to simulate religious belief. What's more, Machiavelli knew that commanding a majority requires a certain, well, flexibility. A prince, he wrote, "needs to have a spirit disposed to change as the winds of fortune and variations of things command him." Behold the birth of triangulation.
The Machiavellian Moment is by no means confined to the realm of politics. "The Prince" is a how-to book for leaders, and these days you're not likely to find our nation's most dynamic leaders in Washington. Business has replaced politics as the best means of acquiring and maintaining power, which is, at bottom, a prince's main concern. In this context, it seems fitting that "The Prince" was, in effect, an unsolicited job application. Machiavelli addressed the book to Lorenzo de' Medici in hopes of currying favor with the ruling family and gaining a government position, any position -- even, as he put it at the time, "rolling along a stone." (As it turned out, Lorenzo promptly set the book aside and never returned to it; he was more interested in two large dogs that had been presented to him on the same day.)
Machiavelli wrote that to rule is to rule alone -- uno solo -- an ideal maxim, it would seem, for the new economy, where a 20-year-old millionaire is born every day. The new economy rewards entrepreneurs, not company men. Loyalty is for suckers. Machiavelli also knew that perception is more important than reality -- men judge more by their eyes than by their hands" -- another cherished truism on Wall Street today.
Of course, things change quickly. As sure as "Machiavellian" once meant evil, "dot-com" may soon enter our lexicon as a synonym for fraud. And thanks in no small part to Bill Gates's recent run-in with the government, a rather un-Machiavellian motto seems to be gaining currency in the marketplace, one first uttered by none other than Abraham Lincoln: "Malice toward none."
So does this mean that the Machiavellian Moment has almost passed, that NiccolRated R's famous smile may soon turn into a frown?
Not necessarily. Machiavelli's most relevant legacy to us may be a good deal more timeless, more universal, than our recent fixation on his maxims would suggest. Interestingly, perhaps his most enduring insights into the human condition are to be found not in his political writings but in his personal letters, where he reflects on a life characterized not by Machiavellian triumphs but by guileless defeats. It's a life that invites neither hatred nor envy, but sympathy.
In 1513, the year Machiavelli started writing "Of Principalities," the booklet that would become known as "The Prince," he was living in forced retirement in his farmhouse in the Italian countryside. Wrongly accused of having participated in a plot to overthrow the Medicis, Machiavelli had been imprisoned, tortured and beaten nearly to death before finally being released. Freedom provided little solace to poor Machiavelli. Once among Florence's great men, he had been disgraced and discarded, shut out of the affairs of state and the bustling intellectual life of Florence that had been so dear to him.
Machiavelli described his days on the farm and his method of recapturing -- if just for a moment -- the nobility of his life as it had been in a letter to a friend. His secret? Some great books and an active imagination. "When evening comes, I return home and enter my study; on the threshold, I take off my workday clothes, covered with mud and dirt, and put on the garments of court and palace," Machiavelli wrote. "Fitted out appropriately, I step inside the venerable courts of the ancients, where, solicitously received by them, I nourish myself on that food that alone is mine and for which I was born; where I am unashamed to converse with them and to question them about the motives for their actions, and they, out of their human kindness, answer me."
Living during the Renaissance, Machiavelli was surrounded by the best and the brightest, which must have only exacerbated his feelings of frustration. Yet he managed to keep everything in perspective. Toward the end of his life, he signed a letter "NiccolRated R Machiavelli, Historian, Comic Author and Tragic Author." The thing is, NiccolRated R Machiavelli never wrote any tragedies. Like the rest of us, he was just trying to preserve his dignity in a world that was taking him for granted -- while never losing his sense of humor about his many failures. Maybe this is the true Machiavelli of the moment.

 IT DIDN'T HAPPEN HERE
 Why Socialism Failed
 in the United States.
 By Seymour Martin Lipset
 and Gary Marks.
 379 pp. New York:
 W. W. Norton & Company. $26.95. 
 Unless you're a patient soul, you probably don't want to find yourself on a Friday evening on a barstool next to someone like me -- someone obsessed with American radicalism's defeats, misdeeds and lost opportunities. Just as card-carrying Libertarian Party members have been known to give strangers unprovoked 90-minute lectures on the gold standard, leftists of a certain temperament are happy to share at length their theories about what exactly went wrong in 1919, or 1936, or 1970. With a few beers and a few counterfactual thought experiments, our evening is complete. If only America's electoral system were proportional rather than winner-take-all; if only the Labor-Populist alliance of the 1890's hadn't collapsed; if only American Socialists had more unanimously and passionately rejected racism, Leninism and the Vietnam War -- these are just a few of the scenarios commonly trotted out by wistful American radicals.
Seymour Martin Lipset and Gary Marks's new book provides a systematic overview of the plausible explanations for the American left's weakness, some of which have been posited for well over a century by sociologists, political scientists and radical activists. "It Didn't Happen Here" will, of course, be devoured by my fellow barroom natterers, but it deserves a far wider audience than that. Even if the word socialism arouses no particular yearning or hostility in your soul, be aware that this debate offers paths toward new and rich understandings of American history. The German scholar Werner Sombart's famous 1906 treatise "Why Is There No Socialism in the United States?" is regarded today as one of the major descendants of Tocqueville's "Democracy in America."
"The inability of American Socialists to create a durable Labor or Socialist Party is not a historical quirk of a bygone era," Lipset and Marks write. "On the contrary, it is a powerful influence on the present." Had they managed to forge such a party -- or to capture the Democratic Party as successfully as the Goldwater and Reagan movements captured the Republican -- the United States would almost certainly not be the only advanced democracy with no system of universal health insurance and no system of universal child support. We might not have levels of income inequality and relative poverty that are almost triple those of other rich nations. (Admittedly, we might be dealing instead with Western Europe's problems: relatively stagnant growth and high unemployment.)
Why did we go down one path and not the other? The best-known explanations involve claims about the broad features of American culture. Following Tocqueville's lead, Sombart emphasized the country's egalitarian ethos: whereas European laborers still chafed against vestigial feudal attitudes, the American worker "carries his head high, walks with a lissome stride and is as open and cheerful in his expression as any member of the middle class." For white workers at least, much of the visceral class-consciousness that fueled European movements was absent.
Alongside this republican ethic, the country's founders bequeathed to almost all of us, leftists included, a robust antistatism. Unlike its European counterparts, the early American labor movement (in both its conservative and its radical incarnations) was highly skeptical about turning to the state for wage protection or social insurance. (The A.F.L. president Samuel Gompers described himself in 1920 as "three-quarters anarchist.") Finally, Lipset and Marks argue, America's Protestant heritage is reflected in the propensity our socialist parties have shown for dogma, fissures and often absurd arguments about doctrinal purity. At the height of the Great Depression, probably the greatest climate for radical organizing in American history, the Socialist Party actually managed to lose almost all its California members. The party's leaders, enforcing a taboo against working within the Democratic Party, forbade the membership to take part in Upton Sinclair's radical End Poverty in California movement -- and over 90 percent of them defected.
Beyond these broad cultural arguments are factors that can be studied more rigorously. One is the effect of immigration, something not easy to summarize. To oversimplify: even though American socialist movements have been disproportionately immigrant-led, immigration has not, on the whole, been helpful to the cause. America's ethnic, neighborhood and religious enclaves ("mutually isolated by their various starting-points," as Friedrich Engels lamented in 1887) have rarely come together in effective class-based political action. Our few successful municipal socialist movements arose in cities with an overwhelmingly dominant ethnic group: Pennsylvania Dutch in Reading, Germans in Milwaukee, Jews on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The problem was not simply ethnic insularity but sometimes outright bigotry. Milwaukee's best-known Socialist leader, Victor Berger (himself an Austrian Jewish immigrant), delivered a racist harangue on the floor of Congress in 1911 against the immigration of "modern white coolies . . . Slavians, Italians, Greeks, Russians and Armenians."
An interesting comparative snapshot underscores the basic point. In the 1910's, Italian immigrants numerically dominated the working class of Buenos Aires, where they developed militant labor, socialist and anarchist movements. During the same decade in New York City, however, Italians were only one of several streams of immigration; there the Italian working class was much less mobilized, and it never became integrated into the largely Jewish Socialist Party of New York.
This sort of concrete, illuminating comparison is what this book is best at. Lipset and Marks similarly use comparative data to explore whether government repression weakened socialism here (not very much), whether America's political structure played a role (yes; the two-party system and the federalist diffusion of authority were both serious hurdles) and the role played by sheer prosperity. This last is not easy to pinpoint -- the correlation between poverty and militancy is not a simple one -- but, well, Trotsky himself wrote fondly of the $18-a-month apartment in the East Bronx where he and his family lived briefly in 1917. It was, he recalled in his 1929 autobiography, "equipped with all sorts of conveniences that we Europeans were quite unused to: electric lights, gas cooking range, bath, telephone. . . . These things completely won the boys over to New York."
"It Didn't Happen Here" might be seen as the culmination of a certain strand of Lipset's half-century career in political science. His first book, "Agrarian Socialism" (1950), was a study of radical movements on the prairies of Canada and the United States. And in 1974 he co-edited "Failure of a Dream?," a huge anthology of essays on the American left's travails. His collaborator here, Gary Marks, is a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina; his book "Unions in Politics" is a comparative study of labor politics in Britain, Germany and the United States. This new book is purely businesslike, stepping into each question and its permutations with almost zero fanfare; one sometimes pictures a high school debate team with index cards at hand. But the index cards are good ones -- the authors are clearly on top of the literature -- and the debate team treats its opponents civilly.
About those opponents: one frequent complaint against Lipset's approach to "American exceptionalism" is that it's too closely akin to the consensus school that dominated the study of history and political science during the 1950's. That era of scholarship tended to neglect and obscure America's deep racial, regional and class conflicts. Throughout this book Lipset and Marks are scrupulous about avoiding such errors -- among other things, they frequently acknowledge that America has seen more labor militancy and industrial violence than European countries with more successful labor movements.
There's another familiar area of criticism, however, where this book does fall short. Lipset and Marks's comparative method focuses entirely on what they think are enduring features of American life (cultural traits, electoral structures and so on) and almost never pauses to acknowledge the importance of particular historical events. They cite the Depression -- when most elements of labor and the left were kept firmly within the Democratic coalition -- as "an excellent example of the way the American presidential system has worked to frustrate third-party efforts." But doesn't it seem in hindsight highly contingent -- mighty improbable, in fact -- that a Democrat with F.D.R.'s supreme political skills happened to occupy the White House then? It's hard to imagine that Al Smith, though similarly sympathetic to labor, would have been able to enact the New Deal so aggressively or to shepherd the left into the party's tent so successfully. And in that scenario it's not outrageous to conjecture that a true Labor Party might have emerged (perhaps built of the same elements as the La Follette Progressive coalition of 1924, which managed 16.6 percent of the vote in that prosperous year). The Democratic Party might then even have gone into eclipse, just as Britain's Liberal Party did two decades earlier. Now, all of this might have been disastrous -- a Labor Party born in the 1930's might well have wound up controlled by Stalinists -- but my point is that during the Depression crisis our two-party configuration may have hung on the slim thread of Roosevelt's charisma. Here and elsewhere, Lipset and Marks make historical events seem more inevitable, more determined by structural constraints, than I believe they in fact were.
This problem is most acute in the book's extremely thin treatment of events since 1945. It's only during the last 60 years, after all, that modern welfare states have been constructed in the social democracies of Europe. This is the period in which the material consequences of this entire debate actually emerge. And yet here we read nothing about how the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 curtailed American unions' power; nothing about how race may have affected the nature of America's small-scale welfare state; nothing about how the Vietnam War divided the American labor-left during the one decade when there was an opportunity to expand its reach. Was the die really cast so firmly way back before World War II?
Still, this is an impressive work. Lipset and Marks present a huge range of material with great clarity, and they make plausible arguments about each of the structural constraints and cultural factors that they weigh. And the book has of course given me new fuel for my agonized bar conversations. One consolation: perhaps in a few decades I'll be joined by an aging Gingrichite, muttering into his whiskey about the botched opportunities of the mid-1990's.

 THE BLIND ASSASSIN
 By Margaret Atwood.
 521 pp. New York:
 Nan A. Talese/Doubleday. $26. 
 Nearly 20 years ago, in speaking of her craft, the novelist Margaret Atwood observed that "a character in a book who is consistently well behaved probably spells disaster for the book." She might have asserted the more general principle that consistent anything in a character can prove tedious. If we apply the old Forsterian standard that round characters are ones "capable of surprising in a convincing way," Atwood's new novel, for all its multilayered story-within-a-story-within-a-story construction, must be judged flat as a pancake. In "The Blind Assassin," overlong and badly written, our first impressions of the dramatis personae prove not so much lasting as total.
The setup and setting are promising enough. This is chiefly the story of the Chase sisters, Iris and Laura, granddaughters of the benevolent founder of a button factory in the Canadian town of Port Ticonderoga. The girls grow up in the 1920's in a large 19th-century house named Avilion after the "island-valley" in "Idylls of the King." After their war-wounded father exchanges his religious faith for disreputable rambles in Toronto and their mother dies of a miscarriage, the girls are more or less raised by Iris's old nursemaid, Reenie, a starchy font of home truths and old saws.
Iris is the older and more sensible of the two sisters; Laura the more alluring and ungraspable. "Laura touches people," Iris explains. "I do not." With her capacity for sudden, passionate attachments to people and beliefs, the younger sister is a bafflingly nervy girl who gets away with things: "Laura had such a direct gaze, such blankly open eyes, such a pure, rounded forehead, that few ever suspected her of duplicity." Iris is obliged to watch out for her, and on one occasion even stops Laura from drowning herself. This stagy moment, as Iris recalls it, allows for the stark juxtaposition of one girl's self-destructiveness with the other's suppressed resentment:
"I couldn't get out of my mind the image of Laura, in the icy black water of the Louveteau -- how her hair had spread out like smoke in a swirling wind, how her wet face had gleamed silvery, how she had glared at me when I'd grabbed her by the coat. How hard it had been to hold on to her. How close I had come to letting go."
The Chase girls' childhood -- tutors, kitchen conversation, factory picnics -- is played out at great length, and while social information should be more highly prized than it is in the modern literary novel, Atwood sometimes operates with the indiscriminate retrieval of an Internet search engine set to "display all." In the last decade, she has been able to keep things moving in her short fiction (some of the stories in "Wilderness Tips" are terrifically economical), but her novels have bogged down in repetition and clutter. The previous one, "Alias Grace," reads like a tale told twice within itself.
When the Depression lays siege to the economy, even Mr. Chase's paternalistic ways can't save the button factory from labor unrest. The building is damaged by a fire apparently set by Alex Thomas, an orphan and ex-divinity student of shadowy origins, a prematurely hard-bitten figure whom the teenage Chase girls proceed to hide in the cellar and the attic. Here the novel most strongly exhibits its peculiar blend of the low and high, like a Nancy Drew story written by one of the Bronts. "I didn't see him at first; he was behind the apple barrel. Then I could make him out. A knee, a foot. 'It's all right,' I whispered. 'It's only me.' "
Economic rescue is extended to the Chases by the heavy hand of Richard Griffen, a competing industrialist and rising right-wing politician who scorns the mollycoddling employment practices of the girls' father. Eighteen-year-old Iris is presented to this cardboard villain like a fee and readied for the wedding by Richard's brittle, ambitious sister, Winifred, the novel's most appealingly awful creation, a sort of Miss Murdstone with plucked eyebrows. In the event, the groom seems more interested in the willful 15-year-old Laura, who goes to live with the Griffens after her father's death but is soon running away or getting into trouble at school or being dispatched to an asylum.
Laura dies -- we learn this on page 1 -- in 1945, at the age of 25, when her car plunges off a Toronto bridge. She leaves behind a science-fiction novel, "The Blind Assassin," which becomes a great posthumous success. Atwood's enveloping novel of the same name alternates between the aged Iris's narration of all the aforementioned events and extracts from this book, whose interplanetary matter is presented as a story being told by a hard-bitten fellow on the run to a young woman who steals hours with him in his various hideouts: Alex Thomas and Laura Chase, we presume.
The less said about Planet Zycron the better; Atwood, alas, says plenty. She lengthily taxonomizes the city of Sakiel-Norn and its class-stratified inhabitants. ("The Snilfards dressed luxuriously and were connoisseurs of music. . . . The smallholders, serfs and slaves were called the Ygnirods.") But she proves unable to relieve the reader's tedium with the place's kinkier features, like children who weave carpets until they are blind and then go on to become throat-cutting hired killers. ("Their sense of hearing was acute.")
Despite her assertion in a recent interview that this new book's fantasy material has its roots in popular prewar genre magazines, Atwood seems to be sleepwalking through a Doris Lessing phase, or exercising once again her own allegorical bent, most famously displayed in "The Handmaid's Tale." Still, even though we're told that "Earth was colonized by the Zycronites," and even though Iris's situation bears an indisputable resemblance to that of Zycron's sacrificial maidens, the two parts of Atwood's big new book feel like separate projects that have been soldered together rather than thematically connected. Worse still, nothing in either part gives a reader much desire to forge connections through inference.
We are assured by the aging Iris that Laura's "Blind Assassin" has given her sister's memory a certain cult status: fans leave offerings at Laura's grave and make graffiti from her novel's sayings; academics take a serious interest in the text. Iris tends her sister's flame with traces of the ambivalence she once showed in rescuing Laura from the Louveteau River and comments on the difficulties of her own aging with an endless, rote sourness that seems more adolescent than geriatric. This is a novel in which spring arrives when "dog doings unfreeze, then wane," and a newborn has "that squashed face, as if she'd hit a wall at high speed." Things tend to let Iris down twice, and the reader is spared neither disappointment. When in Rome, she finds the Colosseum "looking like a mouse-eaten cheese" and the Tiber "yellow as jaundice." She recalls how a long-ago lettuce "tasted like pale green water. . . . tasted like frost." One starts to dread the approach of each common noun. Just as everything in the novel is relentlessly overproved, so is Iris endlessly characterized by these baleful observations.
Adding to an extraordinary stock of rhetorical irritants is Iris's tic of etymologizing or parsing the obvious: "That's my trousseau, I thought. . . . It sounded like trussed"; "I considered the word warn"; "Laura had finally snapped. Snapped, she said, as if Laura was a bean." One also comes up against Atwood's peculiar tendency to mint similes whose vehicles are more obscure than what they're describing: "yeast fermenting, going straight to her head like warm helium." Some bread is said to be "white and soft and flavorless as an angel's buttock." Unless, I suppose, you've also had a wing.
Toward the end, when Iris isn't being reflexively querulous or coarse, the narration settles for phoning things in. "I couldn't make sense of this. I was feeling quite dizzy" is the sort of sloppy wrap-it-up writing one doesn't expect from someone of Atwood's stature. The answer to the book's chief matter of suspense -- the source of the Zycron stories -- answers itself so obviously and early that Iris, while disclosing the truth in the book's last pages, feels obliged to concede to the reader, "You must have known that for some time."
Atwood has said that "Writing is like life in that you don't know where you are until you look back." Unlike life, however, writing provides the opportunity to revise or abandon a journey even after it's been taken. Which might have been the best course here.

HEADLINE: Monday Night Football's Hail Mary

BYLINE: By Julian Rubinstein; Julian Rubinstein is a freelance writer whose last article for the magazine was about John McEnroe.

 BODY:
Last spring, newspapers across the country were publishing articles almost daily about ABC's search for a new "Monday Night Football" announcer to join the veteran Al Michaels in the broadcast booth. With the N.B.A. playoffs in full swing and kickoff still four months away, this kind of publicity would have ordinarily been a testament to the strength and power of the N.F.L. and its top-rated weekly telecast. But, as the N.F.L. commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, knew too well, exactly the opposite was true.
Tagliabue had been feeling the heat from the networks that televise the league's games. In the last go-round, ABC, CBS, Fox and ESPN anted up a record $17.6 billion over eight years, which, they quickly discovered, made it impossible for them to make money. During those negotiations two years ago, Dick Ebersol, president of NBC Sports, had angrily ended his network's 33-year relationship with the league, saying that he "refused to put the livelihood of its employees at risk" by entering into such an imprudent deal. The continued ratings slump last year only hammered home his point. In March, following the worst season ever for "Monday Night Football," ratings-wise, ABC convinced the programming guru Don Ohlmeyer to come out of retirement and retool the show he produced in its heyday. 
 Now, if the newspapers were to be believed, the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh was up for the announcer's job. Tagliabue knew Ohlmeyer as the man who had taken NBC's entertainment division from dead last to the top of the TV universe, and he hoped that the Limbaugh reports were either a joke or a marketing ploy. But ABC was refusing to confirm or deny the reports. He picked up the phone and called Ohlmeyer at his home in Beverly Hills to set up a meeting.
The two men sat down to breakfast a few days later at the Four Seasons in Los Angeles, where Tagliabue suggested Ohlmeyer consider the veteran ESPN reporters Tom Jackson and Robin Roberts for the job. But Ohlmeyer wasn't there to talk about announcers. Instead, he steered the conversation toward what he felt was the bigger issue and the reason he had decided to go back to producing football games at age 55. "This is a critical year for sports and television," Ohlmeyer remembers telling him. So-called reality shows like "Survivor" were about to transform viewers' expectations for entertainment on television. And a new pro football league, dreamed up by the wrestling impresario Vince McMahon and brought to NBC by Ebersol, would begin play in 2001, promising to bring fans closer to the game than they had ever been before. If the N.F.L. wanted to stay ahead in this environment, Ohlmeyer said, it would have to change its ways.
By the end of the two-hour meeting, Tagliabue had only one question: Would Ohlmeyer come to the N.F.L. owners' meeting in two weeks and tell them what he had just told him?
When the new "Monday Night Football" makes it regular-season debut tomorrow night, Ohlmeyer's innovations won't exactly leap out of the TV set. With great effort, he helped persuade the league to mount miniature cameras on the referees' caps and to allow more reporters to roam the sidelines and interview players coming on and off the field at halftime. The greatest change, however, will be the comedian in the broadcast booth, Dennis Miller, the first nonsports announcer ever to join a major sports telecast.
The criticism that greeted Miller's appointment shows what Ohlmeyer is up against. "I thought the game was the entertainment," sneered John Madden of Fox. The purists have a point: sports remains a staple of network TV, and the N.F.L. is the single biggest draw. But there is so much product on the air (by one calculation, 235 hours a day of sports programming pours into the typical American home) that it's impossible for even the mighty N.F.L. to maintain its dominance. More than that, sports is losing the golden demographic it once owned: young men. Forty-seven percent more of them tuned in to the Monday night telecast of McMahon's "Raw Is War" last year than to "Monday Night Football."
Sports had always been considered the ultimate formula -- the original "reality TV" that unlike every other type of show on television never needed reinventing. But the way that Don Ohlmeyer and Dick Ebersol are attacking the problem this year, even that notion is being challenged. As former proteges of Roone Arledge at ABC -- and old friends themselves -- they have made their reputations as entertainment producers. And in their view, relative to what else is on television, sports has lost its spark. Viewers love the highlight reels, but persuading them to sit through an entire game is getting harder all the time.
How far will they be able to go? Ebersol has a completely unproved entity in the XFL, but his costs are low and he can get away with practically anything. Ohlmeyer's advantage is that he has the N.F.L., notoriously conservative and fiercely protective of its game but also far and away the pre-eminent brand in sports, and as tough and ruthless a competitor as Microsoft.
Don Ohlmeyer glides his black mercedes sedan through the crowded streets of Los Angeles toward Dodger Stadium. He's running late for the night game between the Dodgers and the Angels, but he is in no rush. The most important lesson Roone Arledge taught him, he says, is never to be at the mercy of the game.
Ohlmeyer is tall and bearlike, with a mouth that curls playfully at the corners as if to suggest that he always knows more than he's saying. He calls everyone, including his male friends, Honey, making a point of always seeming at ease. He made it through seven years as the West Coast president of NBC wearing black cotton Nike sweatsuits (perfectly pressed) and black loafers, the same outfit he's wearing to the game.
As he settles into his regular third-row seat near first base, he admits that it was frustration with the limitations of sports broadcasting that drove him into the entertainment side of the business 17 years ago. "There was a sameness about it," he says. "People have seen thousands of games. How do you get them to watch my telecast?"
When Ohlmeyer joined Arledge at "Monday Night Football" in 1971, the show's second year, it was the only sports program in prime time. Initially, the network had been reluctant even to fork out the $8.5 million rights fee to put it on the air. But Arledge, then president of ABC Sports, promised to make the show like nothing anybody had ever seen. He deployed three times as many cameras as other networks and provided coverage not just of the plays but also of the players themselves and of the crowd's reactions. The shots of stadium lights gleaming off the players' helmets, backed by the staccato voice of Howard Cosell, made even humdrum matchups seem like once-in-a-lifetime epics. John Lennon, Burt Reynolds, Gov. Ronald Reagan and Vice President Spiro Agnew made guest appearances. While other networks lambasted Arledge's "show biz" approach to football, the show became a juggernaut.
"Monday Night Football" not only defined how sports was packaged on television; it also changed forever the economics of the industry. The major sports leagues, suddenly aware of their value as prime-time fare, escalated their demands for fees. Though total ratings for many sports began to slip in the 1980's, with the advent of cable, the leagues ratcheted up their rates at every contract renegotiation.
Ohlmeyer began to feel the financial pressure as far back as 1977, when he left ABC for the top job at NBC Sports. While there, he hired some of the top broadcasters in the business, including Bob Costas and Bryant Gumbel. But always seeking larger audiences, he put on a Jets-Dolphins game in 1980 with no announcers at all. It rated well, thanks to the hype Ohlmeyer engineered, but he knew it was a one-time gimmick.
By that point in his career, he had bought a house in Los Angeles and was commuting to New York every weekend in the fall to oversee the network's N.F.L. programming. His patience with sports was wearing thin. Soon he not only stopped flying in; he stopped watching the telecasts altogether. On Sundays, he would get up in the morning, hit the golf course around 10 and by 11:30 -- 2:30 in New York, the halftime show -- he would be making the turn at the Bel Air Country Club. "I'd call the studio and say, 'Tell Charlie Jones to stop talking so much and tell so-and-so to talk about why things happen, not what happens,"' he says. "They all thought I was watching."
So when Howard Katz, president of ABC Sports, called him in December to ask if he would consider returning to "Monday Night Football," Ohlmeyer, happily retired and golfing every day, had to laugh. But the more he thought about the offer, the more enticing it became. "This was the show that had launched my career," he says. "Now I had the chance to go back and bring everything I'd learned in the interim to bear." In March, Ohlmeyer decided he would take the job on the condition that he be given complete freedom. Only after he got assurances from Katz and Robert Iger, president of ABC, did he accept.
On his orders, the entire staff, except for his old golfing buddy Michaels, was dismissed. During the news conference announcing the moves, Ohlmeyer talked about wanting to bring "a sense of danger" and "unpredictability" back to the program, the same elements that would soon make reality TV the new craze.
He began working obsessively from home, often waking up in the middle of the night to jot down ideas. To the extent that he can script a game, he will, and he hired a friend, the television writer and producer David Israel, to help him develop compelling story lines based around the players and matchups each week. "Great storytelling is the key element in any medium," he says.
Finding the right person for the booth took time, but the longer it dragged on, he realized, the more publicity the show got. "There would be days when we'd be playing golf and we'd go through 30 different possibilities, everything from President Clinton -- hey, he needs a job -- to guys who are in jail," Al Michaels says. Ohlmeyer had Billy Crystal, Chris Rock and Dennis Miller on his list, but he initially thought of the entertainers as hosts of a souped-up halftime show. In mid-May, Ohlmeyer received a call from Miller's agent telling him that Miller wanted to be in the booth. At that time, Rush Limbaugh was in fact the front-runner for the job; Ohlmeyer saw his divisiveness as a selling point. "People used to pay for the pleasure of throwing a brick through the TV at Howard," Ohlmeyer says. But executives at ABC, including Arledge, made it clear to Ohlmeyer that picking Limbaugh would be a mistake. Then there was Tagliabue. Ohlmeyer knew he had played it perfectly when they met for breakfast. But he still needed the league's favor when it came to getting the gametime access and scheduling preference he felt were necessary
Ohlmeyer figured Miller was "worth a meeting," and after a promising audition, he emerged as the favorite. The other top contender was more in the strident Cosell mold: Tony Kornheiser, a kvetching 52-year-old columnist for The Washington Post who had gained a surprisingly strong following for his show on ESPN Radio. But Ohlmeyer believed Miller's iconoclastic image would better appeal to the key young male demographic. As a courtesy, he called Tagliabue the week before he made the hire and got his blessing. The flirtation with Limbaugh had been shrewd. By comparison, even a comedian was taken seriously by the N.F.L.
Michaels, too, enthusiastically endorsed the choice. "If he's as good as I think he can be," Michaels says, "this will be trendsetting."
Miller, whose weekly HBO show runs from January through August, the opposite of the N.F.L. season, is feeling the pressure. "I have shadow memories of 'Saturday Night Live,' the whole revival of a franchise," he says. "I don't know if I'm the guy to do this, but I'm a decent roll of the dice."
Dick Ebersol is a studious, almost grandfatherly man of 53, an appearance that belies his reputation as the most dangerous man in the business. His ability to land huge deals before anyone else has even imagined them made NBC the leader among network sports divisions over the last decade. In 1995, he stunned the industry when, after secretly flying to the world track-and-field championships in GRated PG-13teborg, Sweden, he sneaked through the hotel's service elevators to meet with I.O.C. members, locking up the rights to telecast every summer and winter Olympics through 2008. No one else had even begun to bid for 2000.
But Ebersol never moved quicker than he did last February, when his assistant popped her head into his office and suggested he flip on the TV. There was Vince McMahon presiding over a news conference at his W.W.F. Restaurant in Times Square, announcing the formation of the XFL, a new eight-team circuit that would begin play the following winter after the N.F.L. season was finished.
After bidding good riddance to the N.F.L., Ebersol had spent the last 18 months trying to create his own pro football league with Turner Sports. But he couldn't figure out what would draw viewers to a league owned by a TV network. The XFL was a little different from what he had envisioned; it was a "brand of smash-mouth football," McMahon said, "not for pantywaists and sissies." It wouldn't be scripted like his wrestling programs, McMahon insisted, but there was no doubt it would be a made-for-television extravaganza like no other in sports. Cameras and microphones would be everywhere, including in the locker rooms and in the huddles; the cheerleaders would not only be the prettiest in football -- they would also be "encouraged" to date the players.
Ebersol was well acquainted with McMahon. In 1985, they went into business together. Then an independent producer, Ebersol sold "Saturday Night's Main Event" to NBC, where it ran for six years, making both men a fortune and putting wrestling on the map. When Ebersol rejoined NBC in 1989, he had to sell his stake back to McMahon, but he had watched as the popularity of the W.W.F. mushroomed. "Raw Is War" was the most popular show on cable television last year.
As Ebersol listened to McMahon that afternoon, he realized that if he was going to put his reputation on the line and buy a football league, there was no surer bet. Producing each game would most likely cost less than NBC paid for a typical three hours of prime-time programming, and linking up with McMahon would all but guarantee a core audience of young viewers. By the time McMahon was in his limo heading back to his Stamford, Conn., headquarters, his cell phone was ringing. It was Ebersol. "Don't do anything else yet," he told McMahon. Two months later, they announced the historic deal: NBC was investing $30 million in the W.W.F. and would be a 50-50 owner of the XFL, marking the first time a major sports league would share ownership with a network. The games will be shown weekly on NBC, one of them as a prime-time lead-in to "Saturday Night Live," the show Ebersol created in 1975.
Ebersol is not new to controversy. Critics have tarred him for moves like his decision to show the summer Olympics in Sydney entirely on tape, so he can package the events as shiny human-interest dramas for prime-time audiences. But the opprobrium brought on by the XFL deal was harsher than ever. It's one thing, after all, to deal with McMahon on wrestling, but endorsing his brand of football? The New York Post headlined its story, "NBC Makes Deal With Devil." The former CBS executive Rick Gentile calls the XFL "a fiasco." Even his mentor thought Ebersol had gone too far. "At some point you have to decide how classy you want to be," Arledge says.
But if Ebersol has been a visionary about anything, it is deal making. By becoming a partner in the XFL itself, Ebersol has declared sports leagues unnecessary middlemen. The game will belong to TV in every conceivable way. "Intimacy is coming, coming, coming," he says. "But it's been slowed down by the infrastructure of sports. With the XFL, intimacy is something the league is based on; it's part of the deal."
At the house of blues in West Hollywood, Vince Mcmahon's entrance is preceded by a booming, lights-out, videotaped introduction, in which Dick Ebersol calls him "the best promoter in America." It is supposed to be a news conference announcing the XFL's new Los Angeles franchise, but he is greeted with thundering applause and cheers. Dressed fashionably in a fitted black suit with a white shirt and no tie, McMahon gets right to the point. "The arrogance and the lack of common sense of the suits at the N.F.L. is not to be believed," he says, mimicking the clipped rhythms of a preacher. "Put one hand on the quarterback -- and the whistle blows! You're not protecting the quarterback in the name of safety. You're protecting him in the name of investments. That's. Not. Football. Pause, sigh. The suits at the N.F.L. Head shake, pause. Penalize end zone celebrations? What the hell is that? Why that's downright un-American."
Tagliabue will not respond to McMahon's taunts or even acknowledge the XFL's existence (on the advice of his lawyers, concerned about potential antitrust charges). But he says the N.F.L. would never consider gimmicks like microphones in the huddle. "Obviously the reason is competitive," the commissioner says. "You can't put strategy on the air for other teams to watch. This is a game of surprise. We've done focus groups, and what they tell us is what sells football is the competition on the field. That's what gives us the No. 1 audience in sports. It doesn't depend on where the microphones are or who we interview at halftime. It depends on the national passion for the game."
Just in case that's not enough anymore, Ohlmeyer is returning to the same tactics he used to make NBC "Must-See TV." He persuaded ABC, for the first time, to hire an outside ad agency to make "Monday Night Football" hip again. The catchy slogan, "Monday Night Football,' It's Powerful Stuff," will be plastered everywhere, on television and billboards and even the floors of supermarket aisles. And he plans to go head to head against McMahon for young male viewers by attempting to buy ad time on W.W.F. programs in the local markets. "It's going to be a battle," says a senior marketing staff member at ABC Sports.
There may also be battles with the league; if ratings don't improve, Ohlmeyer will surely turn up the pressure to be granted more liberties. Even if he can't have microphones in the huddle, he has plenty more ideas where "referee cam" came from. Tagliabue says that he "feels like we're in good hands with Don," but it's clear that unlike McMahon and Ebersol, he and Ohlmeyer aren't in the same business.
"My only concern is the viewer," Ohlmeyer says, leaning back in his seat at the Dodgers game. "That is why Nascar has been so successful. They've changed the rules in the middle of the season to change the air-intake valves, put restrictor plates on. What they're basically saying is, 'We want a race where a bunch of cars will have a chance to win on the last lap.' That's what the fan wants."
By the seventh inning, the highest-paid pitcher in baseball, the Dodgers' Kevin Brown, is giving out hits like Halloween candy, and Ohlmeyer's team is down by four runs. "We're outta here," he says, standing up to leave. "They're not coming back from this."
On a humid night in Canton, Ohio, on the last day of July, the new "Monday Night Football" team took to the air for the first time, a preseason game between the San Francisco 49ers and the New England Patriots. The telecast opened with a beautifully shot prepackaged story about rookies trying to make an N.F.L. team; Al Michaels described training camp as "the ultimate game of 'Survivor."'
When they came back live, Michaels introduced Dennis Miller by saying that he had "come to expect the unexpected, but this is off the charts." It may have been the most anticipated moment in the history of sportscasting. Miller said: "If there's anyone in this stadium more pumped up than me, they wouldn't pass the league's standardized drug test."
The telecast featured noticeably improved sound quality of the grunts and groans of players in the trenches, and the view from the referee cam was revealing. Ohlmeyer's secret plan for halftime would have to wait as the network broadcast an update on the Republican convention. "Republicans and Democrats," Miller said, when Michaels mentioned the halftime fare, "there's a couple of 4-12 teams."
In the end, though, it all felt very much like a football game -- and a bad one at that. The Patriots won, 20-0. Of the seven pages of material Ohlmeyer and Israel had prepared for the announcers, they only used about 5 percent. Miller managed to make use of one of his own well-scripted lines; with a minute left in the game, he said, "Don Meredith used to have his saying. I figured I'll give mine a shot, and I'm going to say, 'Start blow-drying Teddy Koppel's hair, because this one is done."'
It was amusing stuff, but by referencing the past, it pointed out the biggest challenge Ohlmeyer -- and by extension, all of professional sports -- face: how do you make an old, familiar product seem fresh and new? "Monday Night Football" has always treated the game itself as sacred, and it will this season, too, even with a comedian in the booth. Commissioner Tagliabue has to be happy about that. But he won't be if it doesn't boost the ratings.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
The Bard of American Politics, Still Campaigning

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Adam Nagourney is a political correspondent for the Metropolitan desk of The New York Times.

 BODY:
GORE VIDAL wrote "The Best Man" in 1959, a time when Joseph McCarthy's legacy endured, when Adlai Stevenson and Richard Nixon were among the nation's leading politicians, and when Mr. Vidal counted as his friend a young senator from Massachusetts named John F. Kennedy. The play, first produced on Broadway in March 1960, eight months before Kennedy was elected president, drew on these influences to become a tale of politics that may seem improbable today: a stark struggle of two men of obvious complexity, set during a national political convention where decisions of consequence were actually made.
"The Best Man" is returning to Broadway 10 presidential campaigns since it first arrived to favorable reviews. Previews begin on Tuesday at the Virginia Theater, where it opens on Sept. 17 with a cast that includes Charles Durning, Spalding Gray, Chris Noth, Elizabeth Ashley, Christine Ebersole and Michael Learned, under the direction of Ethan McSweeny. 
 The play is dated, yet it is not, and in that, it is very much like the 74-year-old Mr. Vidal himself. Politics have changed mightily since 1959, and the play and its author are a reminder that much of what once so invigorated the nation's presidential selection process -- the suspense, the unvarnished characters, the sense that something meaningful was at stake -- has seeped away.
Mr. Vidal attended his first convention at the age of 14, yet he did not even consider stopping by when the Democrats met in Los Angeles to nominate Al Gore last month, even though he was 25 minutes away by car, settled in at a rooftop suite with a private garden at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. "It's too dismal," Mr. Vidal said, the morning after President Clinton gave his valedictory speech to the assembled Democrats. "I'm not interested in any of the candidates."
Still, Mr. Vidal has not, it seems, lost enthusiasm for what was probably his best-received play, nor has he made any changes in the original script to account for the intervening 40 years. Now formally retitled "Gore Vidal's The Best Man," to avoid confusion with an unrelated movie called "The Best Man" that was released last fall, the drama abounds with themes and lines that are at times strikingly contemporary, notwithstanding the fact that they were written before many of the current crop of politicians were old enough to vote.
"We've had some very good presidents who have slept around a lot more than Bill Russell ever did, and in the White House, too," proclaims the frumpy national committeewoman Mrs. Gamadge (played by Ms. Ashley), as she comes to the defense of a candidate with an exemplary public life and a marriage more complicated than that of the couple now living in the White House. As Russell (Mr. Gray) finds himself drawn into the back alleys of political combat, he laments that he entered public life to put an end to "the business of gossip instead of issues, personalities instead of policies."
Besides the two candidates, who are out to destroy each other, there is a departing president (Mr. Durning), who makes a case for the honorability of lying to the electorate, be it about his terminal medical diagnosis or the fact that he does not believe in God. Most fundamentally, though, Mr. Vidal presents a struggle between two types of politicians who are as common today as they were then: the ruthless, relentless yet effective Senator Joe Cantwell (Mr. Noth), and the honorable, morally grounded yet maddeningly deliberate Bill Russell.
This was Nixon versus Stevenson in its time, the inspiration for the competing politicians in the play, but there is no shortage of present-day analogies. "There are only so many types who are drawn to politics," Mr. Vidal observed. And the questions he raises in setting up the combat between his politicians are the same ones that Bill Bradley's dispirited supporters were asking themselves in New Hampshire as Al Gore cheerfully pummeled their candidate into defeat: Who would make the better candidate for office? And who would make the better president?
"I don't have an answer and I never will," Mr. Vidal said last month in Los Angeles, poking at a slab of seared salmon and drinking iced coffee in the dining room of the Beverly Wilshire, which was teeming with Democratic delegates who, to his constant distraction, had taken to chanting "Gore!" as they marched through the hotel corridors.
"I'm dealing with game players," Mr. Vidal continued. "These are chess games. And I'm not going to analyze the chess player. I'm going to analyze the game." (That said, Mr. Vidal has never attempted to hide his empathy for Stevenson. So it is not surprising that Russell comes across as more noble by the play's end.)
The game, as Mr. Vidal would have it, involves the struggle between Russell and Cantwell to win their party's presidential nomination, played out in two hotel suites in Philadelphia in July 1960, as the convention unfolds around them. Each man has dug up information that could likely doom the other's candidacy. Russell is mortified at his own behavior when, exhorted by his lieutenants and the president, he confronts Cantwell with what he has discovered. "I never thought I could bring up something like this against any man," Russell says. "It revolts me." It falls to Cantwell to buck up Russell. "Oh, come on -- don't give it a second thought," he says. "Look, I don't blame you. I'd certainly use it against you if it was there."
To be sure, the story line would be unimaginable today for obvious reasons. " 'The Best Man' is based on the idea that candidates have secrets," said Jeffrey Richards, one of the play's producers and its press representative. "Today, who has secrets on the eve of the convention?"
In its way, then, the play is a time capsule, a means to measure how much the system has changed. Even the undercurrent of homosexuality, which Mr. Vidal noted was "scandalous" in its time (though certainly not a surprising theme for one of the nation's first openly gay writers), seems almost quaint in these days of Richard Hatch and television's "Survivor."
Even though Mr. Vidal did not alter the script, he would not approach the subject the same way now. "If I were to do a political play today about who governs the United States, it would not be set at a political convention," Mr. Vidal said. "It would be within a board room, as they argue about politicians, and audition politicians, and figure out which one they're going to make president."
Speaking of his drama in light of the present period, he said: "I don't see how you can begin to do a play that's constructed like that -- which is really a dramatic contest between two front-runners. And it can go either way. That doesn't happen anymore. Primaries meant something then, but nobody knew in March who the candidate was going to be -- which we knew in both parties this year. It's predicted by how much money is spent in the primary season and it's quickly wrapped up. So there's nothing to do at a convention but pick a vice president. Generally undramatic, if that."
It is no coincidence that "The Best Man" is being revived this season. Mr. Richards said he had had it in mind for a play-reading project that did not pan out, but still thought "it would be great to do in a year in which there was a presidential campaign."
When he subsequently contacted Mr. Vidal in Italy, Mr. Richards recalled, "His initial questions were: 'Are you really serious about this?' And, 'Do you want me to update it?' "
Mr. Richards said he put "The Best Man" in the category of "classic popular entertainment"; "I wouldn't update 'The Front Page' or 'The Little Foxes.' " At the same time, though, there have been few attempts by any writers over the last 40 years to make politics the subject of a Broadway play (Mr. Vidal tried once or twice after "The Best Man" without much success), and it will be intriguing to see if there is more interest in theatrical treatments of politics than in the game itself. (The 1964 movie version of "The Best Man," for which Mr. Vidal wrote the screenplay, starred Henry Fonda.)
Mr. Vidal is not just another playwright, or historical novelist, or essayist, or commentator, or whichever of the many resume entries he might use to define himself. He has practiced what he is writing about: he ran for Congress from New York in 1960, and for senator from California in 1982, each time as a Democrat; he lost both elections. And while in Los Angeles last month, he was a keynote speaker at a forum sponsored by The Nation, an ideological retreat for Democrats frustrated by the proceedings downtown.
THE speech he gave warned that the drive to increase the country's military might was a threat to the economic viability of the Republic at a time when the nation is anxious for peace and suspicious of interventionism (much as Mr. Gore's grandfather was when he served as a senator from Oklahoma).
"It was quite something," Mr. Gore said. "Not only a standing ovation, but they began to chant, 'Go, Gore! Go, Gore! Go, Gore!' They were running me for president!"
Mr. Vidal is also unusual in that over the years he has kept some notable company. He and Jacqueline Bouvier shared the same stepfather, Hugh D. Auchincloss, at different times, and his conversation is scattered with first-name references to former presidents and first ladies, complete with anecdotes about, and caricatures of, the people he has known.
"It doesn't remind me of Mr. Truman at all," Mr. Vidal declared in a husky falsetto, as he recounted what Eleanor Roosevelt told him when she was asked her opinion of the president in "The Best Man."
As the playwright sat in on a rehearsal the other day in Manhattan, wearing sunglasses and drinking a Diet Coke while the actors competed over the thump of construction machinery outside, he leaned over to offer a real-time footnote to his play. "The next line is one Jack Kennedy gave me," he said. He turned to the makeshift "stage," an assortment of couches, tables and empty Absolut bottles, where one of Russell's supporters proceeded to promise him that he was behind his candidacy "100 percent." That means, then and now, that "you're finished," Mr. Vidal said tartly.
President Kennedy attended a performance of "The Best Man" on Broadway, with Charles Spalding, a longtime friend, at his side. Mr. Vidal stood behind a curtain in the wings, observing the president as the president observed his play. "I had never actually watched anybody who was watching a play," Mr. Vidal said. "I could see their eyes, so I could see who they were looking at. He was following it very attentively. And there was a little giggle between him and Spalding on the line about how to get girls in the White House."
"And then he did his famous" -- Mr. Vidal brought his fingers to his mouth and tapped his teeth, evoking a dozen pictures of Mr. Kennedy -- "which meant he was thinking, he was really following it."
As it turned out, another man who would be president, Ronald Reagan, came close to playing Russell on Broadway. Mr. Vidal rejected that casting suggestion from the producers, and the part went to Melvyn Douglas. "I'm responsible for Ronald Reagan," Mr. Vidal whispered, as the rehearsal continued. "I turned him down for the part. They came to me and said, 'What about Ronald Reagan?' I said, 'He is good, but I don't think he'd be credible as a presidential candidate.' I have always thought that if I had cast him, Melvyn Douglas would have become president. It's been on my conscience ever since."
Mr. Vidal said his days of palling around with presidents ended with the Kennedys: "I learned my lesson from the Kennedys, which is if you want to be effective as a commentator on political matters you've got to stay away from presidents. I was continually attacked as a Kennedy apologist."
He said he had met Mr. Clinton only briefly and found him charming, "and I'm not easily charmed by presidents."
Al Gore is another matter. The two are distant cousins through Mr. Vidal's mother, though Mr. Vidal, in the polite way one talks about strayed relatives, leaves little doubt at his disappointment -- or perhaps disinterest -- in this particular member of the famous family.
Would he vote for his cousin? Mr. Vidal, at this point speaking from his villa in Italy by telephone, laughed heartily at the question. "As they say in the House of Representatives, at the end of the day, Gore is thicker than Nader," he said, presumably meaning that his blood-tie to Mr. Gore counted more than his ideological attraction to Ralph Nader.
In any event, Mr. Vidal said he had never met Mr. Gore, and does not think it possible to learn much about him, or George W. Bush, from the way presidential campaigns are conducted. "We'll never know whether they're interesting or not," he said.
Speaking of himself, Mr. Vidal said that at his age, he had reached the "springtime of my senility." As sharp and acerbic as ever, he is also white-haired, magisterial in bearing and a bit slow in his gait. "I don't do e-mail," he declared. He did not seem fazed at the rehearsal when, during a break, Michael Learned asked if he would autograph a copy of his 1967 historical novel, "Washington, D.C." He is about to publish "The Golden Age," the concluding volume in his series on American history.
Mr. Vidal follows developments in American politics by way of CNN and The International Herald Tribune from his home in Ravello, though he is indignant at the suggestion that he is something of a recluse, a subject he had raised himself as the lunch in Beverly Hills had come to a quiet end, without dessert. "The illusion that the press has carefully developed, because my views are not popular with management, is that I must be depicted as an exile -- an embittered expatriate. I am no such thing, and they know it. I've been involved in every election, in one way or another, as a commentator, sometimes as a candidate, for most of my life. And this, after all, is my subject as a writer."

 BODY:

To the Editor: With more than 570,300 square miles of land mass, Alaska is about one-fifth the size of the continental United States. These facts add perspective to Timothy Egan's story, "A Land So Wild, It's Getting Crowded" (Aug. 20).
While there are powerful outside interests that would like to see our state turned into a national park, Alaska is far from becoming "Disneyfied." These organized groups fail to recognize the economic needs of the state's 615,000 residents, many of whom are dependent on tourism to sustain their families. 
 Accessible only by air and sea, Juneau, Alaska's capital city, is proud of its long-standing tradition of welcoming visitors. Historic downtown Juneau is a port -- not a park -- that has served as the heart of commerce for more than a century. America's last frontier has something for everyone and ample room to grow.

HEADLINE: Where the Pilgrims Lived, Megaprojects Now Loom

BYLINE: By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE

DATELINE: PLYMOUTH, Mass.

 BODY:
FOR 340 years after the Pilgrims settled here, Plymouth and its neighbors in southeast Massachusetts grew very slowly. Then in 30 years, from 1960 to 1990, the population of this 103-square-mile town, the state's largest municipality and still a sizable slice of cranberry growing country, tripled.
Better transportation, good schools, lots of land, reasonable prices and proximity to the jobs in Boston and its beltways attracted families seeking single-family houses in traditional subdivisions. 
 While eager for growth, this town of 50,000 residents and its neighbors in the still rural region began feeling overwhelmed and took various planning measures to deal with the rapid expansion. But that boom seems modest compared to what is coming: megaprojects.
In Plymouth, construction is under way on a 3,000-acre mixed-use project with almost 3,000 luxury houses that will be the town's biggest development so far. That project, called Pinehills, will in turn be dwarfed by another being planned by the A. D. Makepeace Company, a major cranberry grower. The company has filed preliminary plans for tract subdivisions that could contain 3,000 to 7,000 houses on 9,600 acres spanning Plymouth, Carver and Wareham.
The megaprojects have brought worries for these communities.
"The towns are scared to death of losing their open space and having a demand for services -- schools, water, sewer and fire protection -- they can't provide," said John Lenox, the town planner here. "So they've enacted building caps, moratoriums; increased minimum lot sizes; or overencouraged commercial development, all of which consumes twice as much open space."
While Plymouth has a full-time government and a professional town planner able to promulgate sophisticated zoning, its small neighbors have only part-time officials, explained Steven Smith, executive director of the Southeastern Regional Planning and Economic Development District, a federally financed agency working with all of the towns and developers.
"The region isn't prepared for the growth that's coming," he said. "Most of the zoning doesn't give the towns or developers much choice other than large-lot, single-family subdivisions that spread all over the hills."
Basically, Mr. Smith and others worry that the 51 towns from Duxbury (about 30 miles south of Boston) to Westport (just shy of the Rhode Island border) will not have the tax base to deliver resident services or the regulations to prevent the still sparsely settled hills, bogs and beaches from being plowed under or polluted.
Part of the growing attraction of this area is that it is one of few regions in eastern Massachusetts with moderately priced single-family houses. The average selling price in Plymouth this summer was $204,682. In Boston it was $823,000 for a house of fewer than 2,400 square feet; for a larger house, it was $1.4 million, said Debra Taylor, owner of Link, a real estate information service in Boston.
BUYERS like Michael Bash found both more house and a country way of life in Plymouth that is not available closer to his Boston-based cleaning company. Last fall Mr. Bash; his wife, Ellen; and their two daughters moved into a 2,800-square-foot four-bedroom house in Harrison Woods. This 32-lot subdivision, deftly tucked into a wooded 125-acre site, has a private 22-acre pond good for swimming, fishing and kayaking. House prices range from about $300,000 to $400,000, said Vivian Mulligan, who with her husband, Patrick, is the developer.
"Plymouth has breathing room," said Mr. Bash, who moved here from Hull, a tightly packed beach resort just south of Boston, where he had lived for 40 years. "You have your privacy and nice neighbors, excellent schools, more house for your money. And the extra commute isn't much."
Mulligan Homes bought the site, a former Boy Scout camp, in 1997 and started construction the next year. The first buyers moved in last year. Now 20 homes are occupied, six more are being built and the Mulligans are holding the last six lots as an investment. They expect to complete construction of the 26 homes and the surrounding roads by mid-2001.
For decades, Harrison Woods and similar subdivisions have fed the growth here. Now a new era of larger-scale development is dawning as construction on the $1 billion Pinehills proceeds.
Three years of planning will result in 2,854 attached and detached houses priced from about $300,000 to more than $1 million. The houses will be in clusters, and the 3,037-acre forested site will include about 2,000 acres of open space offering residents -- mostly empty nesters and retirees -- panoramic views of Cape Cod Bay, woods and four golf courses.
The developer, Pinehills L.L.C., has construction financing from the Fleet National Bank division of the FleetBoston Financial Corporation.
So far, it has built one mile of roads with underground utilities, a private well, a 7,400-square-foot office building called the Summerhouse and seven model homes set for completion in October, when marketing will begin. Of four golf courses planned, two are in construction along with a village center, which will have 1.3 million square feet of commercial space: a hotel, conference center, retail and offices. The land planner is Sasaki Associates of Watertown, Mass.
Seeing the megaprojects approach, in the mid-1990's Plymouth enacted new zoning bylaws. They allow cluster designs for projects that leave three acres per house somewhere on the site and special permits for more dense developments like Pinehills. On parcels of 3,000 acres or more, the new zoning allows overlay districts, where mixed-use projects can be built in areas zoned residential or agricultural. Because an annual building cap of 185 houses took effect last year, about 200 new houses are going up now, compared with 287 in 1999 and 336 in 1998.
Some local and regional planners point to the cluster-zoning approach taken by Pinehills, which is conserving 70 percent of the site as open space and building private infrastructure, when they contemplate what might happen to the vastly larger property being developed by the Makepeace Company.
According to Mr. Lenox, the town planner, "Pinehills is a positive alternative to the threat of Makepeace."
Makepeace owns 13,000 acres in the area. It is considering building houses on 9,600 acres, which it could also cultivate, but it is now growing cranberries on only 1,750. Recently, as cranberry prices fell and home prices rose, the company began focusing on real estate development.
What worries Mr. Lenox is that the company "might take 9,600 acres out of agricultural use to build thousands of houses in sprawling subdivisions that we can't serve."
This summer Makepeace started working with regional and town planners to develop an alternative to traditional subdivisions that would enable it to continue its agricultural activity and leave open space as well.
To accomplish this, the company hopes the towns will change their zoning to allow New England village style clusters of luxury houses, a conference center, hotel and golf courses, said John O. Drew, chairman of Makepeace's real estate arm, Sassomon Holdings.
"We don't want to do sprawling subdivisions, but we will if that's the only way to protect shareholder value," said Mr. Drew, a member of the Makepeace clan, which owns 80 percent of the company.
Mr. Smith, the regional planner, said, "The challenge is to rewrite the zoning so this project is an asset rather than a blight."
In its attempt to cope, the 35-square-mile town of Carver introduced a 30-house building cap townwide this summer and a special permit for cluster zoning, which could mean lengthy negotiations with developers.
"The idea isn't to be difficult, but for the town to have some control as we work with each developer," said Sarah Hewins, a planning board member.
Effective planning and good design will indeed determine the impact of future growth on all of these towns, said Mr. Bash of Harrison Woods. But he is certain of one thing: buyers will keep coming.
"People need someplace to live," he said. "And this is such a beautiful commute, a few times I drove right past my exit."

HEADLINE: Growing Frustration in the Computer Aisle

BYLINE: By ALLAN RICHTER

 BODY:
MARIA ORTIZ-TABONE has walked out of a half-dozen computer stores empty-handed, qualifying her as either a very cautious shopper or a very frustrated one. Ms. Ortiz-Tabone, a 50-year-old real estate broker, insists she is the latter.
After strolling through an OfficeMax store in Westbury the other day, she walked away without buying a notebook computer she was eyeing because the manufacturer renting space in the store had not yet staffed its kiosk. 
 She did no better when she moved to a display of hand-held wireless computers, stumping a salesman with questions about Internet service. After the salesman moved on, she threw her hands in the air. "You just can't get help," she said. "They read from the display card."
Ms. Ortiz-Tabone has turned to technical magazines to make up for the deficiency. And she has enrolled in a computer class after a day of comparison-shopping left her no better informed than when she started.
She may find more classmates to commiserate with: finding a technically savvy computer sales associate is about to become even more difficult.
This month's arrival of the consumer electronics chain Best Buy on the Island is likely to benefit consumers by stimulating price competition. But the dozen or so stores that Best Buy, which is based in Eden Prairie, Minn., is planning here over the next several years could stretch an already thin retail labor force, never mind one with technical skills.
"Most computer salespeople don't know the difference between a microprocessor and a meat processor," said Jonathan Jacala, 22, a salesman at a CompUSA store in Garden City. Mr. Jacala was clearly segregating himself from the ill-equipped in his profession as he darted along the aisles seeking customers and lucrative commissions.
CompUSA, which was acquired in March by the Mexican retailer Grupo Sanborns S.A., is the biggest computer specialty chain in the United States, with a long list of corporate and government customers. Best Buy, which is scheduled to open in Westbury, Bay Shore, Levittown and Setauket this fall, focuses more closely on individual sales. Jeff Morgan, an analyst at Levin Consulting in Beachwood, Ohio, which tracks the industry, said that in 1998, Best Buy sold about $400 million more in computers for home use than CompUSA did, out of Best Buy's total computer sales of $3.9 billion that year.
The two chains won't battle it out alone, however. OfficeMax is next door to Best Buy's Westbury site, for instance, and within a short drive are the Wiz, RadioShack, Circuit City, P. C. Richard & Son, Office Depot, Staples and independent retailers.
The sweeping competition is propelling sales growth in consumer electronics past that of retailing in general, which in turn has outpaced the Island's overall economic growth, said Gary Huth, the state's labor market analyst for Long Island.
"The buyers are here, the market is here, but there's a lot of competition, and that's why almost all of these national chains are late in arriving to Long Island," he said. "But they all get here eventually. The market will get tighter for hiring."
Some computer retailers have left the market, but not for lack of demand. Ahron Schachter, the general manager and a vice president of DataVision Computer and Video, an independent retailer, blamed the operators of the Source Mall in Westbury for DataVision's departure last year. He said they failed to promote the mall adequately and expected tenants to pay for advertising to promote other stores.
"Our exit was not because the business isn't there," Mr. Schachter said. "The business is there. We just need a better location, a stand-alone store or a mall that understands what its tenants really need to do the business."
Bob Gedarovich, the manager of the mall, said it was a standard practice for tenant retailers to contribute money to market their landlords' malls. He said DataVision's lease required it to participate.
"Sometimes when somebody's business doesn't turn out to be what they had hoped, they look for all sorts of reasons to assign blame," Mr. Gedarovich said, "but the consumer is king and drives the business."
Another store, Tandy's giant Incredible Universe in Westbury, folded because shoppers did not accept the chain's concept of a Disney-style "entertainment destination" in a somewhat remote location, Mr. Morgan, the analyst, said.
The loss of those retailers will be more than offset by Best Buy's arrival. And Circuit City's departure from the appliance business, which is expected to be completed in November, signals its bid for the mantle of digital retail king.
But the sales staff remains an imponderable, and the demographics of suburbia make the challenge of finding skilled workers even more acute.
Mr. Schachter noted that shoppers at DataVision's Long Island store needed more attention than the company's Manhattan customers.
"You get the mothers with strollers looking at computers, and you need the patience to deal with that," he said. "It's not like a customer who walks into the New York City store and says: 'I know the specs already. Tell me your best deal.' "
Retailers have wrestled for years with trying to figure out how many resources to devote to training specialized staff, said Ursula Moran, who follows specialty retailing for Sanford C. Bernstein, an investment research company. Profit margins in computer retail are low.
Still, selling computers is becoming easier as consumers become more sophisticated. About 60 percent of American households own a personal computer, according to Gartner Dataquest, a research company, and about two-thirds are on their second or third machine.
The role of sales personnel in computer stores has waned as online and other direct sales have spread. But Philip Lu, a Gartner Dataquest analyst, warned of a sizable "group of novice users, grandpa- and grandma-type people, who want to get online. They still prefer some touch-and-feel way of buying. They're not that comfortable with the technology, and have questions."
As one path toward improving customer relations, more retailers are combining the lean direct-sales concept with their brick-and-mortar stores. Circuit City, which operates seven stores on Long Island, plans to provide in-store Web access for customers, said Bill Cimino, a store spokesman. Gateway, a leader in mail-order sales, also has stores here, but they carry no inventory and only take orders. OfficeMax rents out space in its stores to Gateway.
Best Buy is a rarity because its sales force is salaried; most electronics retailers pay their sales associates by commission. But salaried sales personnel may be less aggressive, perhaps to a fault, leaving customers to their own devices when help may be preferred.
But Ms. Moran, the analyst, said that Best Buy overcame problems brought on by rapid growth by investing more heavily in training. "If you go into a Best Buy store these days," she said, "you will find some qualified people."
But can Best Buy and other retailers count on finding skilled employees in the midst of one of the most severe labor shortages the Island has seen?
Best Buy cast a wide net and began its recruiting drive in July 1999, and the company said it was meeting its goals of hiring up to 250 people for each of its planned stores on the Island.
Adam Levin, the president of Levin Consulting, said Best Buy's employment ranks are buoyed by the salary structure and its mix of computer and music products. These draw a younger sales force, he said, compared with the career salesman more likely to be found at Circuit City or P. C. Richard.
The trick is in the training. "We've got people from our competition, from grocery stores, people in the car industry," said Dave Schandle, the general manager of Best Buy's Westbury store. "I've got a stock-market analyst working for me as a part-time salesperson."
Another Best Buy strategy that has worked in other markets has been to import workers from out of state, putting them on a fast track to management in exchange for making the move, said Peter Caruso, a first vice president of Merrill Lynch in Manhattan.
But the resume of David Ring, the retailer's district manager -- he was a regional district manager for the Wiz and brought 15 employees to Best Buy with him -- points to the most likely source for many sales employees: competitors.
The Island's high turnover rate among retail employees is borne out by statistics from Mr. Huth, the state analyst: he estimated that about 12,500 job openings a year in the sector are caused by employees' departures, while only about 2,000 openings are the result of new positions.
For Mr. Jacala, the CompUSA sales associate, job security could not be stronger. "I'm pretty sure CompUSA is the best place to work," he said, "but if anything happens, there's always Best Buy."

HEADLINE: Teaching the Fourth 'R': A Sense of Reality

BYLINE: By JOAN SWIRSKY

 BODY:
THEY'RE teaching ancient Greek in Riverhead and Chinese in Great Neck. Jericho High School students enroll in an emergency medical technician class. In Syosset, middle-school students are learning how to get rich; in Eastport, elementary-school students are learning how to be virtuous.
Reading, writing, and arithmetic, the bedrock of school curricula for generations, are no longer enough, many Long Island educators say, to prepare their students for the challenges of the new century. 
 "The world is much more complex than it used to be," said Jean L. Clark, principal of the South Woods Middle School in Syosset, explaining why the school now offers eighth graders an elective Wall Street-Madison Avenue course in which students develop business plans, create their own mock enterprises, sell the concept to their peers and issue fake stock for fake investment capital.
In addition, they tour the New York Stock Exchange and Federal Reserve in Manhattan, are lectured by parents and account executives from firms like Smith Barney, and participate in a statewide competition in which they create their own portfolios and spend a fictitious $100,000 to research, buy and sell stocks.
"The money is theoretical," said Arthur Goldstein, chairman of the business education and family and consumer science departments in the Syosset school system. "But the course and the competition teach kids that these things are real and involve risk, and how hard it is to be successful making money. They learn a lot when they're not successful -- that investments are more than buying and selling paper. They create capital that fuels the economy of our country."
The Madison Avenue component of the course, he said, "teaches kids who are exposed to so much TV and the Internet how advertising influences their lives as well as businesses and consumers, and that the world of business and advertising is not male-dominated."
The course is a springboard to high-school courses in investment decision-making, sports marketing, business research and ownership, and restaurant management, among others. They can earn college credits through Long Island University, and "about 80 percent of colleges accept these credits," Mr. Goldstein added.
Jenna Rosenfeld, who took the Wall Street course at Syosset's H. B. Thompson Middle School last year, said, "My mother belongs to an investment club and my father invests in the market, so the course gave me a better understanding of a subject that's a big part of everyone's life."
Also on the Syosset middle school menu is "Latin at Lunch," in which students meet in the cafeteria to learn about the roots of English words, study Roman culture and architecture, and hold toga parties.
At Great Neck South High School, Phyllis Trautman Chen has taught Mandarin Chinese for the past four years. "Today, with so many American companies doing business with China," Mrs. Chen explained, "increasing numbers of students are interested in the country and its language. It's the same kind of interest American students used to have in Russian, but now they seem to be bitten by the China bug."
Tim Gurba, 18, took the Chinese course for four years before graduating last June.
"At first, I took the course because my dad pretty much mandated it. He thought it would be good for my future. But the course more than fulfilled my expectations," he said. "Even in a daily sense, I found the language to be just as useful as Spanish, and as far as the future, there is no telling what sort of global economic impact China is going to have, so knowing the language gives you the extra competitive edge in the business world."
At Eastport Elementary School, character development is taught from kindergarten through sixth grade.
"The course is important," said Priscilla Tuttle, who heads the character education committee at the school, "because it demonstrates to children that they can become better people by accentuating their positive qualities. It gives them a reason to believe in themselves and develops traits they'll need in later life when their employers want a responsible, respectful person working for them."
Mrs. Tuttle, who teaches chemistry at Suffolk County Community College, and is the mother of three children under the age of 12, said the course content was based on a survey of parents who rated 15 character traits in order of importance. Nine were chosen, one for each month of the school year.
In conveying the values of responsibility, cooperation, kindness, acceptance, honesty, heroism, fairness, perseverance, and building self-esteem, the teachers employ a variety of methods. If, for instance, a child catches a classmate being kind, the name of the virtuous child is written on a paper leaf that is hung on the school's Kindness Tree.
The children tote garbage bags through the streets of Eastport to assist the town's spring cleanup, donate toys and games to the Salvation Army to distribute to needy families and invite the school's auxiliary staff of secretaries and custodians, whose photographs and names are featured on a bulletin board, to speak to them about their jobs.
Zachary Skarka, 7, said that when honesty was the character trait of the month, he learned that "honesty is important because you and someone else can get hurt. You can lose friends.
"Always tell the truth," he added, "or people won't like you. Lies can get bigger and bigger."
Thomas Lickona is a professor of education at SUNY-Cortland and author of "Educating for Character: How Our Schools Can Teach Respect and Responsibility."
"Education," he said, "has two great goals: to become smart and to become good. Character education used to be an integral part of school learning, but it got less popular with the rise of positivism in the 1940's -- facts are empirical; values are subjective; the personalism of the '60's, that shed new light on personal dignity but also neglected personal responsibility; the pluralism of the '70's that made people ask, 'Whose values should you teach?' and the secularization of the public arena in the '80's and '90's that banned prayer in schools."
Dr. Lickona said that courses like the one taught in Eastport "are a return to a much older form of character education, where honesty, compassion, fairness, self-control, respect and responsibility are recognized as objectively good qualities that transcend time and culture and help the individual and society stem the slide down the ethical tubes."
Such courses may soon be appearing all over the state. The Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act, which became law in July, mandates that by next July, all public schools in New York must establish "safer and more effective learning environments" through a variety of measures, including comprehensive violence-prevention education programs, granting teachers and principals increased authority to discipline students, and "instruction in civility, citizenship, tolerance, and character education."
"When students are taught the principles of honesty, tolerance, personal responsibility and respect for others, and when they learn courtesy and how to obey rules and laws, all our schools -- students and teachers alike -- will be safer," said Kenneth P. LaValle, a state senator from Port Jefferson and a cosponsor of the measure.
The trend to have schools teach character is not universally embraced. Lainie Marin of East Rockaway said that her daughter Lindsay, 11, a seventh-grader at the Lynbrook Middle School, "can learn the laws of society in school, but when it comes to morals and ethics and knowing right from wrong, that's where the nurture part of parenting comes in. Those are the prerogatives of parents."
"Besides," she added, "people have different definitions of character, so how can a parent be sure that a teacher shares the same values as her student's family?"
Dr. Lickona said that it's not only students who benefit from unconventional programs and courses, but educators as well.
"Teachers want to make a difference in the lives of their students," he said, "not just teach fractions."

HEADLINE: Battle Lines Harden Over Syosset Mall

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

DATELINE: SYOSSET

 BODY:
THE six-year battle over an upscale shopping mall in Syosset will draw a little closer to a resolution on Thursday when the Oyster Bay Town Board holds a public hearing on the proposal. The developer, the Taubman Company of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., is asking for a special-use permit to build the 860,000-square-foot project, to be called the Mall at Oyster Bay, on the 39-acre site formerly owned by the Cerro Wire and Cable Company.
Since 1994, when the development was first proposed, the project has been a source of controversy in the Town of Oyster Bay. 
 "This has become an emotionally charged issue," Supervisor John Venditto said. "Everybody has an opinion and everybody wants the last word. We're dealing with an application that could have a significant impact on the personality of the Town of Oyster Bay and that could change the direction of its future."
Mr. Venditto said he expects the town board to vote on the project next month.
If approved, the Mall at Oyster Bay will be a fashion-oriented shopping center, with a Neiman Marcus and two other anchor stores. One of them may be Saks Fifth Avenue, which was thwarted last year when it tried to move its Garden City store to Roosevelt Field. There will be 125 to 150 smaller shops and a three-level parking garage.
Harry Murphy, the senior vice president for development at Taubman, said: "We're not interested in building another Roosevelt Field. We've discovered in our research that many fashion-oriented stores, like Neiman Marcus, have been looking to get into Nassau County for a long time because it's a ripe market. We have a list of tenants who have no presence on Long Island who we think might be interested in coming out here."
The mall's supporters contend that it will generate jobs and tax revenues, but its critics argue that Nassau County does not need another mall, that it will adversely affect stores already established in other shopping centers and that it will drive out smaller local merchants. They contend that traffic will be a problem, with an estimated 24,000 cars going to and from the mall each day, causing bottlenecks on major arteries. Further, they fear that drivers will cut through residential streets to get to the mall, endangering children in the neighborhood and at two elementary schools nearby.
"I don't know of anyone in the community who approves of this project," said Susan Sariego, who lives in the East Birchwood section of Syosset, near the site. "We are all concerned about how this will affect our quality of life. They keep talking about upscale, but upscale is unimportant when it still generates traffic and pollution to our community. Cars are still cars. I can't imagine how our children will be able to cross the street."
Traffic congestion and safety are the most pressing concerns for local residents, said Todd Fabricant, the chairman of the Cerro Wire Coalition, a group of some two dozen civic associations united to block the mall.
"Jericho Turnpike is already a disaster at 5 o'clock," he said. "The mall's primary entrance will be very close to the Long Island Rail Road crossing, which will result in dangerous conditions. When you put 3,000 cars an hour in front of a railroad crossing on an ongoing basis, there is no way that people will be able to move. There is also no public transportation for workers to get to the mall. Just wait until Christmastime and when the mall runs sales."
Residents are concerned that the proposed mall will destroy existing businesses, said Len Gutterman, a board member of the West Birchwood Civic Association, which represents a neighborhood near the site.
"We've seen Home Depot, BJ's and Costco come to the Island and knock out many small stores," he said. "We wonder, if another mall comes in, what will happen to the small merchants along Jericho Turnpike and Northern Boulevard? And what will happen to the Broadway Mall and Walt Whitman Mall that are not far away?"
Last month, the Nassau County Chambers of Commerce, representing 6,000 businesses, came out against the mall.
"The county is malled out," said Gary Hudes, the organization's president. "From a business standpoint, another mall would result in cutting the retail pie into smaller and smaller pieces. People only have so much money to spend, and unless you bring in new shoppers from outside Nassau County, which is unlikely, the existing money will just be spread around even more."
Mr. Murphy, the executive at Taubman, which was responsible for the Mall at Short Hills, in New Jersey, said that community resistance to a proposed mall was a common initial reaction, one that usually disappears once the mall opens.
"We developed a similar project in an affluent neighborhood in Short Hiills, and there were many concerns, but now they love us there," he said. "We intend to do the same things to make this work in Nassau County."
The Taubman Company is a 50-year-old publicly owned manager of retail malls at 28 locations throughout the United States. Working with the Tribune Company, the Chicago newspaper publisher that now owns the Cerro property, Taubman took control in 1990, four years after Cerro closed its plant and sold the site.
The Cerro Wire and Cable Company built its plant in the early 1950's, and with a work force of 600 it manufactured electrical conduits and copper rods there. The state Department of Environmental Conservation declared it an inactive hazardous waste site in 1983, but after a cleanup, it was removed from the list in 1994.
Proponents of the mall say it will create 4,500 construction jobs and 1,900 permanent jobs and bring in $7 million in property taxes and $22.5 million in sales taxes each year.
"This is a responsible project that will provide $100 million in wages" in three years, during the site preparation and the mall's construction, said Morton Weber, the Melville lawyer who represents Taubman. "Local residents are complaining that they don't want it here, yet these will be the same people who will be among the first to shop there."
The Nassau-Suffolk Building Trades Council, which represents about 60,000 construction workers on Long Island, recently endorsed the project.
"We need work opportunities for our people," said its president, Jack Kennedy. "We're talking about a lot of employment over a long period of time. The property has been an economic black hole that contributes next to nothing in way of tax revenue to the county or town. It's time to build and get rid of this eyesore."
Gary Lewi, Taubman's community affairs representative, said: "The mall is the only thing on the boards that stands between us and tax increases that could be so onerous as to erode our property values. This is something that critics will have to wrestle with, because it's an economic fact of life."
But critics think otherwise. "This is a zoning and planning issue that should not consider the fact that Nassau County is having fiscal troubles," said Howard Avrutine, a Syosset lawyer who represents the Birchwood Civic Association. "It's about how the land should be used appropriately in a way that is harmonious with the surrounding area. Why should residents nearby this property bear a disproportionate burden because Nassau County has financial problems? This shouldn't be a bailout on anybody."
In anticipation of the hearing, Mr. Venditto, the supervisor, said: "There are two very strong positions. It seems that regardless of the final decision by the board, the matter will be the subject of litigation in the Supreme Court and probably beyond. We are determined to make sure that our decision is adequately supported in law by the evidence presented on Thursday."

HEADLINE: E-Business Alters ABC's of Real Estate

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
AS telecommunications companies lease and modify space for their special needs and for the elaborate specialized pieces of equipment that are the backbone and nerves of electronic commerce, landlords and brokers are adapting some of their ways of doing business to adjust to the new conditions.
Because of their need to have an extraordinarily high level of reliability, the telecommunications companies are installing their own backup systems, including batteries, generators and air conditioning equipment that are independent of the systems already working in buildings. And they are changing established landlord-tenant relationships, including which party makes decisions and who controls parts of a property. 
 Telecommunications sites are becoming a significant factor in the commercial real estate industry. According to a survey conducted by Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate services company, 4.9 million square feet of space has been leased or purchased by these companies in the metropolitan New York region in the last two and a half years.
Because the telecommunications industry is the basis for the new Internet economy, the penalties for an operating failure are severe. As a result, technical experts are being given greater control of lease negotiations than in the past, observed Jeffrey Bernstein, a managing director of Insignia/ESG, the real estate services company.
"About two years ago I began to notice that the deals were driven by the technical guys, not the financial guys, " said Mr. Bernstein, who has specialized in telecommunications leases.
"These companies absolutely do not want to go dark, and so they rely on cautious engineers," he said. "You find yourself in a conference room with three technical guys across the table negotiating a lease." Knowing they will be blamed if the system crashes makes the engineers all the more careful, he said.
The emphasis on reliability has also led tenants to insist on more control of their own spaces. In the past, tenants shared the electrical and mechanical systems installed by a landlord in a building. Today, telecommunications companies want their own generators, cooling systems, fuel tanks and pumping systems independent of other tenants and the landlord.
Indeed, one of the marketing points for a new telecommunications building on 57th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues proposed by the Durst Organization is that it will have multiple risers -- vertical shafts that rise through the building -- and that tenants will have independent access to the risers without having to go through another tenant's space. And telecommunications companies want to do the work themselves, not being willing to allow a landlord to do anything that might compromise their reliability and independence. "In the early telecom deals, the landlords did the work and not everybody was happy," Mr. Bernstein said. "Now the tenants do the work, which is a big change. In the old days, the landlords would never let a tenant anywhere near a riser or anything vertical."
The new building proposed by the Dursts is an indication of how the needs of high-tech tenants are changing the way buildings are being designed. Instead of uniform floors, the structure is to be replete with special zones. There is a mechanical equipment zone on each floor and a roof equipment zone at the top of the six-story building. Inside there are multiple riser shafts to distribute electrical power, telecommunications cable, fuel oil and coolant from the basement to the upper floors.
The zones are being designed into the building to support the tenants the Dursts are hoping to attract, which are primarily machines and only incidentally people. Named the NYCyberCenter, the building is intended to house the powerful computers and switching equipment that are essential to the growth of commerce on the World Wide Web.
"This is a new type of building, like 4 Times Square," said Douglas Durst, the president of the Durst Organization, referring to the Conde Nast building on Broadway between 42nd and 43rd Streets. While the office building was designed to be environmentally correct and includes two fuel cells to provide independent electrical power, the Cybercenter is being designed for e-commerce.
"Web hosting is a high margin business," said Robert Stella, a senior vice president of CB Richard Ellis, the real estate services firm representing the Dursts on the 57th Street project, "and it is linked to the growth of business-to-business and that is what this building is intended for."
"These companies expect to be billing $1 million a minute when they are operating," or more than $500 billion a year, said Richard A. Romm, a senior principal in SCR Design Organization, citing a commonly used estimate of the industry's potential revenues. . "That is a lot of money."
When older buildings are modified to host telecommunications and Web hosting companies, the requirements are usually similar: multiple sources of electrical and communications cables to lower the chance of an interruption in service. And, even though Consolidated Edison is one of the most reliable utilities in the country because its cables are buried underground rather than hanging overhead, most installations include batteries and generators as additional backups.
"These guys want a belt and suspender, and then they add more belts," one real estate executive commented.
The electrical demands of the densely packed ranks of telecommunications equipment means that landlords are being forced to provide power in amounts scarcely contemplated just a few years ago. Durst has said its new building will be equipped to deliver 100 watts of power per square foot, compared with 5 or 7 seven watts per square foot in a typical new office building.
More power means more heat, which means these buildings will have to be cooled even on the coldest day in winter. Last weekend, at another "telecom hotel," cooling towers were lifted for installation on the roof and setbacks of the old AT&T building at 32 Avenue of the Americas, just south of Canal Street. One floor of the building, the 15th, has been reinforced and modified to house diesel-powered generators that will be used to keep the telecommunications companies that are moving into the space given up by AT&T in operation if something happens to public utilities.
"These are 24/7 businesses, 365 days a year," said John J. Gilbert, chief operating officer for Rudin Management, which owns and manages the building, using the current term for around-the-clock operations. Indeed, this invasion of technology is prompting the use of terms not previously common in real estate circles. He said the telecommunications companies are seeking "five nines" reliability, which means that they are trying to find ways to be in operation 99.999 percent of the time.
ANOTHER term being used is "N plus one systems." This means if a tenant needs three generators to sustain operations in the event of a power failure, it should install four, the amount needed plus one. "The idea is that you can keep running even if there is a failure in your own system, in addition to electrical grid," said Richard T. Kennedy, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate services company.
"If you need three generators, install four, if you need three cooling towers, install four," he said. "That way if the power goes out, and you have to take one of your own units off line for maintenance, you can still keep operating."
Some companies have gone beyond "N plus one" to what is called a "2 N system" where the backup system is itself completely backed up. "Some installations have put in two complete systems, each capable of handling the load," said Julius Bogad, a partner at Jaros, Baum & Bolles, a consulting engineering firm.
Mr. Kennedy is representing Bush Terminal, a five million square foot collection of 12 multifloor warehouses on the Brooklyn waterfront. The owner, Industry City Associates, is seeking to transform two of the buildings into a telecommunications center. Plans call for the installation of backup generators on the space behind the buildings where railroad lines once brought cargo from the docks to the city.
Putting the generators outside on platforms, instead of on a special floor in a building or on the roof, takes advantage of something that is more available in Brooklyn than Manhattan: open space. "There is no land area in Manhattan," said Bruce B. Federman, a partner in Industry City Associates. "We have the land, so we can be more flexible." Using outside space avoids the expense of preparing a floor inside for the heavy, vibrating machines, and there is also no need to replace windows with louvers to secure an air supply for the diesel engines that run the machines and piping to vent the exhaust outside.
Other telecommunications projects in New York include a building at 85 10th Avenue at 15th Street, which is being adapted for Level 3 Communications, and 636 11th Avenue at 46th Street, which is to be occupied by Global Crossing Ltd. Another is a former tire parts factory at 470 Vanderbilt Avenue in Brooklyn, which is being developed for multiple tenants by the Carlyle Group of Washington, D.C.
Another center is the old Western Union Building at 60 Hudson Street, between Worth and Thomas Streets in TriBeCa. This was one of the first buildings in Manhattan to be converted to house modern communications equipment, and brokers say some of the decisions made there offer a guide for subsequent conversions.
"Not everybody has space to install generators, but the need to be in the building to interconnect with other companies is so great that some tenants are willing to sacrifice reliability," said John Peters, a former broker with Cushman & Wakefield, who now operates Technology Real Estate. He said landlords now establish master plans for buildings to ensure that all tenants have equal access to space for installation of generators, coolers, antennas and fuel tanks.
Telecommunications companies are choosing old industrial buildings today because of their ability to carry heavy loads and other practical considerations, rather than the prestige of the address. Mr. Stella of CB Richard Ellis said this reflects the maturity of the industry. "Eight or nine years ago these companies wanted to be in Class A or B buildings to give the impression they were established," he said. "But today it does not make any sense to pay $80 or $90 a square foot to house equipment."
Brokers say space in Manhattan for telecommunications installations ranges from the mid to high $40's per square foot annually, with space in other boroughs and suburbs renting for about half that amount.
One of the early tenants at Bush Terminal is Winstar Wireless, a long distance carrier. Algis Butkus, the company's senior manager for construction, said the systems being installed now at telecommunications centers are an extension of the backups that kept voice systems working during power failures.
"With the voice system we had batteries as a backup, and we never lost telephone service," he said. "Now we are taking it farther with the additional cooling and generators. You don't want all your eggs in one basket."
Implicit in the emphasis on redundant power supplies and backup systems is a skepticism that the deregulated electrical industry will be able to supply all the power the companies will need on a reliable basis. But at the same time, the companies are pushing the utilities to install equipment to supply power well in excess of their present needs. This is particularly true in New York, where the companies fear Con Ed will not be able to handle the full load, particularly during a hot summer.
Although Con Ed has sold many of its generating plants under the terms of deregulation, it is still responsible for delivering power and there are physical limits on how much power it can buy outside the region and transmit into the city.
"Obtaining electrical capacity is difficult, particularly in New York City," Mr. Bogad said. "So the companies overstate their requirements, so they will have it if they ever need it." He said the companies say new generations of equipment are physically smaller than earlier gear, so more can be crammed into the same space. This increases the need for power to operate the equipment and more power for cooling to keep temperatures low enough that the equipment will not be damaged.
Mr. Bogad said he had not seen an installation that required more than 30 watts per square foot. But the Dursts want 100 watts per square foot and say Con Ed has agreed to supply it.
THAT poses a problem for any utility. The utility makes the capital expenditure to install the distribution equipment and recovers its investment as the user buys electricity. But if it installs gear to supply 100 watts per square foot and the user demands only 20 or 25 watts per foot, it is not receiving payment on all of its invested capital.
Mr. Bogad said utilities would sometimes agree to install capacity well in excess of a user's likely need if the user is willing to make payments above the cost of purchased electricity. And, he said, many of the telecommunications companies are willing to pay. "Time is important to these companies, and when they need the capacity, they want it there in a hurry," he said. "With the revenues they are anticipating, they are willing to pay for reserve capacity."
A Con Ed spokesman said the utility is willing to provide the extra electrical capacity, as long as customers are prepared to pay for the cost of the extra equipment and maintenance.
Telecommunications companies can be difficult neighbors in a crowded city. Residents of TriBeCa have complained that the noises from the equipment operating at 60 Hudson have disturbed the neighborhood.
Durst executives say their neighbors on the far west side of Manhattan are less likely to be disturbed, because most are business or industrial, rather then residential.Current plans call for placing all the louvers on the 58th Street side of the building, where there is a block square Con Ed plant. The sites at both ends of the block are to be developed in later phases, perhaps as office buildings, since that is the Durst specialty.
The zones in the telecommunications building are designed to accommodate auxiliary equipment like generators, coolers and batteries. The mechanical equipment zone will have a load bearing capacity of 250 pounds per square foot, compared with 150 pounds a square foot for the rest of the structure and less than 100 pounds per square foot for a standard office building.
In recognition that telecommunications companies often hang cables from the ceiling for ready access, the floors will also be capable of sustaining a hanging load of 100 pounds per square foot. The roof equipment zone will be reinforced to carry 250 pounds per square foot for tenants' communications, electrical and mechanical equipment.
The lower level will be available for tanks to store fuel and coolant. It will also have parking for 100 vehicles, most likely to service tenants' wiring networks.
Robert Fox, a senior principal of Fox & Fowle, the architects of the NYCyberCenter, said designing a new building is easier than adapting an existing one to the needs of telecommunications companies. "These companies are talking about millions of dollars a minute; they cannot afford to go down," he said. "They need something better than the best."

Bills. Thrills. Spills.

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY

 BODY:
Governor Whitman has never surfed 40-foot waves or parachuted thousands of feet off a radio tower. At least, if she did, she never issued a press release on it.
But in this era of all things extreme, the 53-year-old mother of two is about as fit -- and fitting -- a chief executive as there is when it comes to getting out on the ski slopes or mountain bike trails or basketball courts or on horseback. And getting banged up in the process. 
 While her well-publicized injuries have undoubtedly been painful -- like the chipped finger bone and torn lip she got in a biking accident in California last weekend -- they have not hurt her politically.
"Certainly, it makes her seem more real," said Matt Stark, 27, of Jersey City, the manager of the New Jersey Rock Gym in Fairfield, where working stiffs can loosen up and release tension by climbing a man-made boulder. "She's going out having a good time. She's not sitting in her office stressed out, worrying about what bills are floating around in front of her nose. It's nice to know that she can kick back and relax."
The governor was trying to get in some last-minute fun while on vacation in California's Napa Valley last Sunday before flying back to New Jersey, when she was riding a rented mountain bike down a steep paved road. As she told a group of reporters on Monday at the State House, who could not help but notice the cast on her right middle finger and the six stitches in her upper lip, she was trying to stay ahead of a driver who was bearing down on her on the single-lane road when she went off the road's edge.
With that, Mrs. Whitman did what Generation X refers to as a face plant on the hard ground. The blood-and-guts governor said she got right back up and pedaled to the rental shop to return the bike, got stitched up and caught her flight.
"I wanted to get that last ride in before getting on the plane," Mrs. Whitman told reporters. "If you don't bring back some real blood, it's not a real vacation."
Apparently so.
While in Davos, Switzerland, with the likes of Bill Gates and Bill Clinton in 1999 for the annual World Economic Forum, Mrs. Whitman broke her leg when she took some time to hit the ski slopes. But the governor was back at work soon afterward with metal pins in her leg.
There was also her rotator cuff surgery in 1996. After a year of physical therapy, the governor was still missing the plate with her curveball, and her fastball had lost a lot of its movement and velocity. Or maybe it was simply that her right shoulder was in pain. In any event, she ultimately resorted to surgery to repair the rotator cuff in her right shoulder, an operation much more common among people who sign their name on baseballs than on legislation.
Eager to get back in the game, the governor left the hospital an hour after the procedure.
And perhaps like so many backroom deals in the name of open space or income tax cuts, there may be countless scrapes and bruises that have never come under public scrutiny.
Laura Otterbourg, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Whitman, said the governor had been active all her life, whether riding horses while growing up in Somerset County or playing basketball with her State Police bodyguards. Ms. Otterbourg said the governor did not believe she was taking unreasonable risks with her health, safety or the stewardship of the state.
To try to glean any insight into the governor's political behavior through the lens of her athletic pursuits -- could her bold 1993 campaign pledge to cut income taxes 30 percent and her high-speed Napa Valley descent be rooted in the same compulsion to take risks? -- is to indulge in so much psychobabble, Ms. Otterbourg insisted.
"I believe she is a good role model for residents of all ages from New Jersey, and none of her injuries have ever kept her from doing her job," she said. "She's always been physically active, whether it's horseback riding, bike riding, hiking, working on the farm. She wouldn't say she's a risk taker, she's physically active. She makes well thought-out decisions and being physically active has nothing to do with this process."
Whatever it may relate to, her physical activity is far from unique among elected officials. Athleticism and physical fitness has long been a valued part of a politician's image, and officials from John F. Kennedy to Franklin D. Roosevelt have gone to great lengths to conceal their frailties.
Among current governors with a sporting image, 47-year-old Gary Johnson of New Mexico was the first chief executive to compete in Hawaii's Ironman Triathlon, according to the National Governors Association. Gov. Pedro Rossello of Puerto Rico, 56, is an avid tennis player who has won five men's singles championships on the island. Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah, is, naturally, a skier. And Gov. Jesse "The Body" Ventura of Minneota was a professional wrestler for 11 years.
Closer to home, the two Republicans most likely to vie for Mrs. Whitman's seat next year -- Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco and Assembly Speaker Jack Collins -- are both avid golfers (How about a sudden-death playoff instead of a primary?).
James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, agreed with Mr. Stark, the gym manager, that Mrs. Whitman's athleticism is most likely good for her image.
"Her sports activities and the like probably really helped to humanize her, because she does come from a wealthy background in the Somerset hills, so the fact that she can fall off a bike or injure herself playing basketball with state troopers or have a skiing accident, probably humanizes her," said Professor Hughes, himself a jogger. "It probably resonates well with other maturing baby boomers who at this stage in their life are experiencing similar mishaps."
As for when the governor would climb back on a mountain bike, Ms. Otterbourg said: "I would imagine soon. She loves bike riding, and it's not going to keep her off."

In the Paperless Era, the Problem Is Too Much Paper

BYLINE: By MARGO NASH

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
All of his clients old economy or new, law firms or tech firms, hospitals and colleges or cellular phone companies -- have the same problem: Paper.
That is where Leon Kroll, chief executive of Archives Management Inc. here, comes in. 
 "They all think that their paper is unique," Mr. Kroll said recently. "My paper? I need my paper. I want my paper. I love my paper. Every lawyer thinks that his file is more important than all the other files in the world, that no one else has this problem. No one else has this problem? I'm in business because you all have this problem."
In this paperless economy -- in which nearly everything is stored on a computer disc and backed up on another -- storing paper records is a billion-dollar business.
For years, Pierce Leahy and Iron Mountain Inc. slugged it out for control of this country's business records. Last year, Iron Mountain acquired Pierce Leahy for $515 million in stock, and now it controls 40 percent of the market. The rest is divided among smaller regional companies like Archives Management, an 11-year-old company whose remarkable 35 percent a year growth is indicative of the nascent market.
In the records management business, one talks boxes. Eleven years ago, Archives Management had no boxes. Now it has 600,000. The company has five trucks on the road picking up yet more boxes -- 30 employees in all, 150,000 square feet of storage space and a new warehouse that will allow the company to store a half-million more boxes for clients who come from around the state as well as Manhattan and eastern Pennsylvania.
Men with scanners traverse the catwalks along the 22-foot-high shelves that seem to go on endlessly in all directions. Each box has a bar code and inside each box the files are catalogued.
Rob Kroll, Leon Kroll's son, and the company's manager of information systems and technology, says some customers are even beginning to ask Archives Management to help them manage the files in their offices as well.
"Leon and his son came in last month and showed us how we can capture control of our entire filing system," said Joseph Berger, executive director of Norris, McLaughlin & Marcus, a law firm in Somerville with offices in Westchester and Manhattan.
Mr. Berger said that when attorneys get busy, it is easy for files get misplaced "and we lose a lot of valuable time looking for them. So we have looked at Leons' system and are in the early stages of incorporating it in how we do business here."
Still, for what most companies would consider a modest fee, records centers provide secure, vermin-free, climate-controlled and smoke-sensored space. Moreover, commercial records centers provide high-tech indexing, retrieval and rapid delivery.
At Archives Management, a file can be retrieved within three minutes of a request 24 hours a day and can be faxed or delivered in hours. The company also provides electronic data protection and vault storage.
"Archives Management has become like a second filing area for us," said Robert Pinto, files and supplies supervisor at Greenbaum, Rowe, Smith, Ravin, Davis & Himmel, a law firm in Woodbridge. "They have it all computerized. We can find everything we want. We fax them every day with requests."
The 60-year-old Mr. Kroll used to be in the garment business with his father, manufacturing children's outerware, but when they closed they were left with an empty factory. Some friends asked if they could store business records at the vacant building, and soon he and his friends began learning about records management.
"Someone suggested there was a guy in Georgia who did this," he said. "We all went to Georgia, and we met this guy and he had a building that looked like a fortress, and he took us around the building and he had boxes. It was the first I had ever seen of this. I said, 'How many boxes you got?' He had about 3 million. He said, 'I get $3 dollars a box.' The next day I went into business."
Later he bought out his friends.
Mr. Kroll recruited his first clients at a New Jersey Bar Association meeting in Atlantic City in 1989 -- even though his father warned him that there was not enough paper in the world to make a business out of storing it.
But father doesn't always know best. John Ford, managing director of the equity research group at Bear Stearns & Company Inc., says storing and managing business records is a $2 billion-a-year business in the United States.
Clients buy boxes and rent space per box. A standard box costs $1.75 and about $3.25 a year to store. There is a modest fee for each retrieval and delivery, but there are a lot of retrievals and deliveries. Some company's require 12,000 a month. Companies may begin with a small amount of boxes, but sooner or later, with mergers, acquisitions, laser printers, E-mail and faxes, the boxes multiply exponentially.
"We used to do records storage ourselves," said Georgine Welch, director of materials management at Bayshore Community Hospital in Holmdel. "We would lease a warehouse. We tried to run it with our existing staff. It was just a nightmare trying to keep the inventory straight, not to mention it cost a fortune between leasing and personnel resources. So we contracted."
As Dr. dt ogilvie, associate professor of strategic management at Rutgers University School of Business, put it: "If you are going to keep your documents on-site, as time goes on you're going to have more space devoted to your documents than to your business. Commercial storage companies do it more efficiently, cheaply and give you better service."
Mr. Kroll scoffs at the notion that paper is disappearing. "Just look at lawyers," he says. "Their main product is paper."
Even the technology companies store a lot of paper, he added.
"There's more paper now than there ever, Dr. ogilvie noted. "We do more diverse things, make duplicates of E-mail messages. And because this is a more litigious environment, people want to document everything and there are legal requirements stipulating how long different types of documents must be saved."
Convincing potential customers that it is cost-effective to store their records with his company has not been hard, said Mr. Kroll, and he explained it this way:
"I go to a law firm. They say to me, No problem. We have it covered. How do you have it covered? We have it stored at the local mini-warehouse down on Route 22. I say to the lawyer, Excuse me, who is in charge of that? They say, Oh Sara. She sits in the front and the key is in her drawer. So when you need something you tell Sara? How much do you pay her $15 an hour? She drives in her car, gets there and the box she needs is on the bottom and now she has to drive back to get you? And she schleps you back to get the boxes and how long did that take? About two hours? And how much do you get paid? Two hundred dollars an hour? Four hundred dollars? I'm going to do it for $1.75."
Mr. Kroll remembers what it was like to try sell children's outerwear to buyers. "They want the button here, you got the button there," he remembered. "They want the blue, you got the red."
Convincing someone to store their records, he said, "is easy compared to selling a snowsuit to a buyer at J. C. Penny's."

Four Prisons and Counting

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: LEESBURG

 BODY:
Needing a place to lock up dangerous offenders, the New Jersey Department of Corrections decided this month to take the well-worn path to Cumberland County, already the home of four prisons, more than 8,000 inmates and the recession-proof growth industry they have brought to the far reaches of South Jersey.
But the men to be sent here are not the usual burglars and drug dealers; they are sex offenders ordered committed by the courts after serving their prison terms. And what looked like the path of least resistance has led to fierce resistance as county leaders and state legislators promise to fight the agreement by Maurice River Township to take this group. 
 "This is basically economic profiling," said Freeholder Director Douglas Fisher. He noted that several years ago the state tried to put a nuclear waste dump in Fairfield, the poorest township in the state's poorest county, and has now turned to Maurice River, barely better off, as its "dumping ground for violent sexual predators."
The township already has two state prisons, Bayside and Southern State, on a 13,000-acre tract of marsh, forest and cornfields along Route 47. The new 300-bed institution is to be built on the Bayside grounds, though the exact site has not been fixed.
Prisons -- which account for 1.7 percent of the state's population and about a quarter of the Department of Corrections' population -- are the biggest business in the county. A total of about 5,000 people work at Bayside and Southern State, as well as the new South Woods State Prison in Bridgeton and the Fairton Federal Correctional Institution in Fairfield Township. Among them is Maurice River Township's mayor, Ronald D. Riggins Sr., a sergeant at Southern State.
The Department of Corrections had planned to build in Woodbridge, which challenged the proposed facility in court, choosing Maurice River instead a few weeks ago. Mr. Fisher said the decision caught county officials by surprise. He said Jack Terhune, the corrections commissioner, assured him last year that "he would not push to locate it here."
Through a spokesman, Chris Carden, the commissioner declined to comment. Mr. Carden would only say, "We're going forward with the site at Bayside.'
Mr. Fisher has asked the governor for a moratorium on prison construction in the county, and three other freeholders are planning hearings next month. Assemblyman Nicholas Asselta and Senator James Cafiero have protested, along with officials in Vineland, Millville and Dennis Township.
"There's no one in favor of this," Mr. Fisher said.
All of them are trying to overturn the vote of the three-member township committee on Aug. 17 unanimously adopting a resolution to accept the new unit in exchange for a payment of $825,000 a year by the state. The township's current budget is $3.6 million, of which $300,000 comes from state payments for Bayside and Southern State.
Mr. Fisher said he was not unsympathetic to the township committee, which he said was apparently bullied by the state. And Freeholder Louis Magazzu, who is calling for hearings, said he wanted to look at "what is driving the need for Morris River Township to be open to this."
The reason, Mr. Magazzu said, was fiscal desperation, in part because the state did not give Maurice River Township payments comparable to those it gave Camden and Bridgeton -- each $1 million -- for the two prisons it already has.
Deputy Mayor Andrew Sarclette said the concern from freeholders and state legislators was a bit late. "We have been fighting for more money for years, and our school situation is atrocious," Mr. Sarclette said. "Where were they then?"
He said that while they publicly urged a halt to the plan, none of the state and county officials had even placed a call to Maurice River Township. "That's what discourages me most," he said.
Mr. Sarclette said that the resolution was simply a statement of support and that the committee members had not made any deal with the state. Still, he made clear that they were ready to sign an agreement.
"There's no way we can ever get these kinds of ratables", he said. "A few people I've talked to tell me they're not thrilled about sex offenders, but the majority I speak with will take the money."
Residents acknowledge that the state payments and salaries -- corrections officers, for example, earn $36,100 to $55,300 a year -- are keeping Maurice River Township afloat.
As she checked out at Lillians Produce Market, a few miles up the road from the prisons, Gladys Holmes, a 77-year-old lifetime resident of the township, noted that there were prison employees in all four houses across the street from hers. "They do have good benefits and good pay," Ms. Holmes said. "I just wish they hadn't started the whole thing."
Behind the counter, Kathy Giles nodded in agreement. "They used to have the canning houses and clamming and oystering here," Ms. Giles said. "But they're gone, and a lot of people who aren't skilled are stuck with whatever they can get."
The owner of the market, Pat Buganski, volunteered that she grew up on the farm across the street from the prison dairy, a minimum-security unit, where the inmates "weren't too scary."
But Ms. Buganski also said that after Bayside was built in 1969, "Mom said, 'There won't be murderers. There won't be sex offenders.' "
Bayside and Southern State, primarily medium-security prisons, have housed some sex offenders, but the state has never had a unit like the one to be built here.
Nothing like it existed when the ominously named Sexually Violent Predator Act was passed in 1998. Enacted four years after Megan's law, it changed the standard for the civil commitment of sex offenders who had served their terms but were deemed too violent to be released. The law also required that the corrections department and Department of Human Services establish a new class of institution for such offenders, who had previously been confined in state psychiatric hospitals.
About 150 men are expected at what is now called the Special Treatment Unit, while those who are most seriously mentally ill will continue to go to the state forensic hospital in Trenton.
Mr. Carden said that security measures for the new unit were still under discussion but that the department could not apply its usual classifications to people held under civil rather than criminal law.
James Goff, the president of the Patrolmens Benevolent Association Local 105, which represents corrections officers, said the Department of Corrections was retreating from a pledge it made to Woodbridge to build a maximum-custody facility. He also said the township committee failed to make clear to residents that it would house inmates who had committed violent crimes.
"The more politically pleasing term is civilly committed offender," Mr. Goff said. "But basically, they're warehousing people too violent to be returned to society.
"The lackadaisical attitude of the department is, 'We got a lot of flak in North Jersey, so well shove it in South Jersey,' " he added. "And they're going to downgrade the level of security."
Especially after the example of Raymond Alves, the rapist who was prematurely and improperly released from Southern State in March, many residents are nervous about security beyond the state's control.
Ms. Giles said some prisoners stay in the area after their release, and she said "a lot of people in the community worry" that sex offenders will be even more inclined to do so. "Lets face it," she said. "They have a hard time going back to where they came from."

Home-Grown Innovation, Home-Grown Workers

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
THE chronic problem of the nation's high-technology labor force? Simple: There isn't enough of it.
The shortage of technology workers explains one of Washington's annual rituals. Silicon Valley executives warn Congress that unless private industry is allowed to hire more skilled foreign workers, growth in the new economy will sputter for lack of able minds. Organized labor complains, but to little effect. The industry typically prevails, reasonably, because the problem is a real one -- and the visa quotas for skilled immigrants are raised once more. 
 Nothing is more American than immigration. Yet the persistent shortage of home-grown technology workers to fill these high-skill, high-wage jobs does suggest that something is amiss in the labor market. Why isn't the supply of graduates from the nation's universities adjusting faster to meet the demand? What policy steps can help solve the problem?
Those questions are the focus of a recent paper by Paul M. Romer, an economist at the Stanford Business School, prepared for the National Bureau of Economic Research. Mr. Romer is a pioneering thinker behind a set of ideas called new growth theory.
Put simply, new growth theory emphasizes the economic role of innovation. And innovation, according to Mr. Romer, is the X-factor in an economy, the elixir of sustained growth. So the goal of policy, he says, should be to foster innovation.
The right kinds of institutions are essential, he wrote in his paper, but "unfortunately, in the last 20 years, innovation policy in the United States has almost entirely ignored the structure of our institutions of higher learning."
In an interview, he explained that any policy analysis has to "get deeply into the details of how those institutions work."
In the university system, he sees a marketplace sorely in need of new and different incentives if it is ever to help erase the shortage of skilled workers in technology fields. He said he believes that there is a role for government to play in overhauling those incentives.
Too often, according to Mr. Romer, government programs intended to encourage scientific research have simply handed money or tax breaks to universities and companies -- which mainly increases the demand for scientists and engineers without doing anything for the supply.
"The crucial input," he said, "is to have more well-trained people who are engaged in innovative activities."
He would spend the money differently. At the undergraduate level, he recommends paying schools a bounty for increasing the number of graduates who receive science or engineering degrees -- $10,000 a head. This would reward liberal-arts schools, whose student populations tend to run heavy with English, history and social science majors, with an incentive to expand science and engineering programs.
At the graduate level, Mr. Romer sees different dimensions of the problem and suggests a different kind of supply-side subsidy. Increasingly, he said, research grants go to star professors, who then support graduate students as their research assistants. This system, he says, delivers some real benefits in basic research, but it nurtures an academic research culture instead of one that responds well to the needs of commerce.
THE Romer solution is to liberate graduate science and engineering students from dependence on money trickling down from professors; instead, he would have the government underwrite three-year fellowships with $20,000 annual stipends for nearly 17,000 students a year to pursue advanced degrees.
The two programs would combine to subsidize the right thing -- turning out more qualified people -- while giving more power to individuals and innovative institutions to decide how resources are used, Mr. Romer argues, adding that this approach sidesteps political problems. "It avoids the issues of pork-barrel science, giving money to politically favored constituents, and it also avoids the pitfall of having the government try to pick technology winners and losers," he said.
The price tag? For 100,000 additional undergraduate degrees, $1 billion a year, and another $1 billion for the graduate fellowships.
Justifying the spending, he said, would be the "social return" -- improved prospects for higher growth over the next 20 to 50 years, as more people engage in innovative activity.
In his paper, Mr. Romer cited a comparable policy that proved a winner: creation of a new academic discipline, computer science, in the 1960's. "Even now," he wrote, "with the passage of 40 years, our sense of the magnitude of the payoff from this investment is still growing."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota Avalon XLS;
How Do You Say 'LeSabre' in Japanese?

BYLINE: By LEONARD M. APCAR

 BODY:
IN the 1970's, Japan's automakers made a name for themselves in the United States with small cars that were reasonably priced, economical to own and fun to drive. Detroit sold small cars in those days -- Chevy Vega owners, please stand up -- but its heart wasn't really in it.
But whenever Toyota, Nissan, Honda or even Mazda tried to beat the Big Three at their game -- building trucks or big family cars -- they usually fell flat. There aren't many fan clubs or newsletters for enthusiasts of the Toyota Cressida. 
 Then, five years ago, Toyota brought out the Avalon, a made-in-America family sedan aimed right at the business that Buick, Chrysler and Oldsmobile had owned for years. Based on the ever-popular Camry, the Avalon was a smooth-riding, well-padded cruiser that was long on quality although a little short on flash. It looked like a fancier Camry, which itself had styling that was far from the cutting edge.
Car buffs dismissed the Avalon as a Japanese Buick. But today, even Toyota executives use that description as shorthand for what the car is about: easy-riding, mid-
range luxury for buyers in their mid-50's, which is considerably younger than the average Buick customer.
Buick, by the way, has also transcended its reputation. Last year, when I tested the redesigned LeSabre with an optional touring suspension, I was surprised by the car's relatively crisp handling and taut road manners. Taut? Crisp? These are not words one used to associate with Buicks.
So how does the Avalon measure up against the LeSabre? Pretty well, actually.
For the 2000 model, just about every visible element of the Avalon was changed. It is wider and taller to give it greater stature and more room inside. To add space, the dashboard was moved forward several inches and the rear seat was set back a tad. The result is a cabin built for stretching out.
One of the most noticeable changes inside is a Buck Rogers dashboard with a large, back-lighted liquid-crystal display showing the date, time, compass reading and outside temperature. The display is eye-catching, with amber lettering on a cool blue-green background, but it is so large and distracting that it is hard to get used to.
The interior redesign results in more headroom, and in significantly more legroom in the rear. Since the Avalon is now wider, and there is little dead space between the doors and the seats, it is not a stretch to call this a six-passenger car when it is equipped with a front bench seat. In no car, including this one, is the middle seating position comfortable for long, but the room is there to put three adults abreast in front and rear. There are three adjustable headrests in the back along with three shoulder belts.
All this interior decorating has produced an exterior design that is, at first, jarring. The idea was to make the Avalon look a lot different from the Camry, and it does. But it also comes off looking a little dated in some ways, a little heavy and oafish in others. The body seems high and disjointed, as if it was designed by committee.
The Avalon's flat sides hark back to the sheet-metal slabs that Mercedes has scrapped on its biggest cars. The fixed windows behind the rear doors serve as reminders of the opera-window craze of the 70's. And behind the sizable trunk, the tailights attempt to mimic Mercedes but miss badly with oddly positioned backup lights that detract from the otherwise simple design.
But if prospective buyers find the Avalon's look ungainly, it is not keeping them out of showrooms. Although the car is at the high end of its price bracket, with a base price of $26,300 and fully dressed XLS sedans exceeding $34,000, sales are up a whopping 90 percent from 1999. Business is so good that Toyota has increased production at its plant in Georgetown, Ky., where the Camry is also made. Clearly, many shoppers think the Avalon is worth its $4,000 premium over a comparable Camry.
On the road, the Avalon is quiet and competent, just what you'd expect from Toyota. Outside noise is pretty well muted, as are the bumps and ripples of the road. Braking is superbly confident, and while there was some minor hesitation in acceleration it was insignificant. The four-speed automatic transmission was virtually seamless.
The Avalon executed corners well for a front-drive car of its bulk, and while it backed away a bit in some twists of the road -- leaning a little here and there -- it fared better than most sedans in its category.
In a matchup with the LeSabre, I would give the Avalon a slight edge. The ride is smooth and the handling is impressive, with no hint of sloth. But a fully equipped LeSabre costs several thousand dollars less than a loaded Avalon, and Buick currently offers a $1,500 rebate, to boot.
I was disappointed that the Avalon's 3-liter, 24-valve V-6 requires pricey 91-octane gasoline, particularly since the power plant is quite similar to the regular-gas engine of the Camry. The chief difference is that the Avalon V-6 has sophisticated variable valve timing, which raises the horsepower to 210 from 194. The good news is that the fuel-economy rating ranges from 21 m.p.g. in the city to 29 on the highway.
The 2000-model test car came with some annoyances that were surprising, given its $34,033 window sticker. For one, while there were lots of thoughtful interior touches, like covered storage bins in the doors, reading lamps and power outlets, the power-window switches were not lighted at night. There were also inexcusable rattles, some from the pull-down compartments in the doors. Every time you closed the door or hit a bump the items inside jingle-jangled.
There were also rattles in the front cup holders -- particularly surprising given that their lids, and the glovebox door, are dampened to glide open slowly and softly.

HEADLINE: The Pursuit of Less

BYLINE: By CHRIS ERIKSON

 BODY:
AT dusk on a midsummer evening, not long after trading on Wall Street has closed for the day, nine people gather in a Greenwich Village living room to talk money. But this group speaks not of wringing more profits out of a bull market. They want to make do with less.
Money is also on the agenda in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, as half a dozen women of varying ages sit around a kitchen table, sipping tea and picking at fruit and cookies. The topic for tonight is community, and they ponder in particular this assertion: that the culture's raging materialism will go unchecked as long as people feel an absence of meaningful social ties. 
 Such groups, which have a growing audience in New York, share a dedication to voluntary simplicity, the national back-to-basics movement whose followers renounce consumerism in favor of stripped-down living. Seeing spiritual bankruptcy in an American Dream that equates success with possessions, they have deliberately decided to earn and spend less.
Asceticism isn't a groundbreaking concept, of course; as long as there have been possessions, there have been simplifiers, from Buddha to Thoreau. Nor is the current trend brand-new. With roots in environmentalism, it has been gathering steam for a decade in the Northwest, ground zero for voluntary simplicity.
Skepticism about the movement is not new, either. Critics dismiss it as budget-cutting dressed in New Age clothes, and even some adherents reject the ideological proselytizing that can accompany the practical advice.
But the movement has been on the rise in the last year in New York, a city virtually synonymous with conspicuous consumption and fast-track living. Last fall, a voluntary simplicity conference at the Open Center in SoHo drew more than 300 people for workshops with names like "Are We Possessed by Our Possessions?" and "Leading a Life of Integrity." This fall the School of Continuing Education and Professional Studies at New York University will offer a course on voluntary simplicity.
When an Upper West Sider named Mary Barknecht posted a few lines on a Web site called the Simple Living Network (www.slnet.com) in August 1999 in hopes of starting a voluntary simplicity discussion group, the response was overwhelming. She has since started 10 groups and has a waiting list of people eager to join new ones. Her e-mail list has grown to a couple of hundred names. "It has just snowballed," she said.
Of course, any movement trumpeting the virtues of austerity has a tough row to hoe in a city where earning and spending is something of a contact sport; where too much is never enough; where dinner for four at Alain Ducasse is nearly $1,500; and $150-a-head dinners are as common as pigeons in Central Park.
"You've got the belly of the beast right here," said Pat McDonald, a psychotherapist and career counselor who will teach the N.Y.U. course on simplicity. "More people than ever are into this, but New York is the last place you'd expect to find it."
Paul Wachtel, a clinical psychologist who lives and works in Greenwich Village and the author of "The Poverty of Affluence" (New Society, 1989), also senses growing disenchantment amid the current economic bonanza. Some of those who have not been swept up in a spending frenzy are repelled by what they see around them, he says. Others feel an emptiness no matter how many things they stockpile.
"When people are in the midst of what they think is the American Dream and their lives don't feel very good, that's when they can begin to question," Mr. Wachtel said. "And I hear it much more now than I did even five years ago."
WHEN it comes to downsizing, Mary Barknecht knows of what she speaks. Dressed neatly in a plain red cardigan and a white button-down shirt, her graying hair tied back in a ponytail and her face free of makeup, she projects an aura of contented calm. But there was a time when her life was very different. She once ran a court transcription business and spent much of the go-go 80's working round the clock.
"I was mentally and physically exhausted all the time, and I compensated for that by spending my money on the usual stuff," she said. "I had enough beautiful designer linens for a 10-bedroom house, and I lived in a studio apartment. At that point I realized something was a little out of sync."
So in the early 90's, she did an about-face. With a healthy nest egg, thanks to careful saving, she quit her job. Out went the designer linens, along with bags of shoes and boxes of knickknacks. She canceled her magazine subscriptions and put a stop to the catalogs that stuffed her mailbox. Beyond essentials, she says, she stopped buying. Last summer she bought a pair of sandals on sale, her first new shoes in five years.
Today she lives on $11,000 a year, most of which goes for rent and health insurance. Her other expenses total about $100 a month. Her Upper West Side apartment is airy and attractive, and at first glance it looks like the home of an average city dweller, but on further inspection it reveals itself as a laboratory of nonconsumption.
Take the kitchen: no microwave; no food processor; cloth towels substitute for paper. Cloth shopping bags hang on the doorknob, and a compost bucket sits next to the sink. Its contents go to a community garden. There are no commercial cleaning products. Ms. Barknecht scrubs her bathroom with baking soda and her copper pans with vinegar and salt.
For transportation she uses the subway and a secondhand bike. For entertainment, she goes to free concerts or volunteers as an usher to get free theater tickets.
Her dedication to dirt-cheap living might make her an object of pity to New Yorkers for whom $100 wouldn't cover a night out, but she says she has never been happier. In her late 40's, she does a lot of volunteer work, which increasingly involves promoting the simple life.
As well as simplicity circles, Ms. Barknecht runs groups on finance, the Greenwich Village one among them. They are called Your Money or Your Life groups, after the book by that name (Viking, 1992). Written by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin, a former stock analyst and his wife who moved to Seattle and downsized, the book offers a nine-step program to financial independence, advising participants to track their spending and to think of purchases in terms of the "life energy" expended to buy them.
At a recent meeting, members of the Village group, who are from their 20's to their 60's, set other goals: to meditate, watch less television, fight clutter. They also discussed the environmental damage caused by Central American coffee growers. (The solution: buy free-trade coffee.)
The word addiction surfaces several times, as when talk turns to the temptation to break out the credit cards.
"It's like when someone is quitting smoking, and they go walk around the block instead of having a cigarette," said Rachel Aydt, 28, a research editor for YM magazine, who attends the meetings with her fiance, Jim Burton, an actor and contractor. "You walk into a store and see something on sale, and you think, do I want this?"
If voluntary simplicity sounds vaguely like a 12-step program, it is a little like one, says Pat McDonald, a group member. Participants say they are quitting something that is hard to shake: a mind-set that measures people by what they own.
And if resisting that temptation is hard elsewhere, in New York it can be downright brutal.
"New York City is like one big shopping mall," Ms. McDonald said. "Wherever you go, you're faced with choices to buy this and buy that. It's all about consuming." One woman in the Carroll Gardens group spoke of having "an episode" at Macy's.
WHILE the concept of paring down is straightforward enough, in practice it can be complicated. Once past the basic tenet that less is more, a host of alternative practices enter the picture, from yogic breathing to vegetarianism to composting. The philosophy is not just to spend less but to be aware of the effects, environmental and otherwise, produced by choices.
Not everyone buys every principle. Ms. Aydt says the financial advice she gets from her group has helped her be conscious of money, but she doesn't always appreciate the political proselytizing.
"It's like you're given a list of ideologies to follow," she says. "I do find it alienating."
Some find the entire movement off-putting, sanctimonious or just silly. To James Twitchell, an English professor at the University of Florida at Gainesville who studies consumerism, the only thing new about voluntary simplicity is the extent to which the consumer disillusionment of middle-aged women has been exploited by publishers of self-help books. He chafes at the "victim language" adopted by the movement and what he calls the "medicalization of consumption, where you need help, namely the 12-step method, to wean yourself away from the habit."
As Mr. Twitchell notes, telling people how to downsize is a growth industry: a flock of groups are dedicated to spreading the simple life, and a growing pile of books touts its virtues. "I mean, to have to buy books to stop buying things, to have to attend meetings to stop buying things, to see yourself as a victim to stop buying things?" Mr. Twitchell said. "Good God, woman, just take your credit cards and rip them up."
Erin Oates, 42, a public relations executive in Manhattan, said she once "shopped with the best of them." But the simplicity message hit home a few years ago, around her 40th birthday. "I started reassessing what my life is all about, and I don't want it to just be about collecting things," she said. Her first foray into simpler living was to make a family pact to stop exchanging Christmas gifts. Then she moved into a smaller apartment, shedding a lot of stuff along the way. Now she carefully tracks her expenses and is still paying off credit card debt. She brings her lunch to work and dips into a box of Quaker Oats for breakfast instead of stopping at Au Bon Pain.
She has also stopped prowling clothing stores before every new season or social event. Keeping her wardrobe up to date "used to be a lot of what my life was about," she said, but now her formerly jammed closet contains only a few modest feet of hangers and eight or nine pairs of shoes.
As she gives a tour of her tidy, antiques-filled one-bedroom on the Upper West Side, Ms. Oates is dressed plainly but stylishly in a purple cotton blouse (marked down to $17 at Ann Taylor) and a black skirt (a recent splurge she justified because the skirt is all-season and doesn't need dry cleaning).
On her salary, she says, she can still afford her old way of life. But, she added: "I want to feel like I'm living more intelligently. It's a matter of slowing down and not feeling like a rat caught in a maze."
THE spike in interest in voluntary simplicity in New York mirrors a pattern in other cities. Betsy Taylor, executive director of the Center for a New American Dream, a nonprofit group in Maryland that promotes nonconsumerist choices, said hits on the center's Web site had risen from under 125,000 in 1997 to nearly 1 million in 1998 to more than 3 million for the first seven months of 2000.
During that time, simplicity has become a marketing buzzword, and the principle behind a pair of new monthly magazines, Time-Warner's Real Simple and Simply City, which published its third issue last month in New York. With fashion layouts and articles about spa etiquette and a Parisian water bar, Simply City promotes a citified vision. Its editor and publisher, Danielle Chang, says the goal is to strip simplicity of its New Age aura and make it "more accessible, less ascetic and more fun."
She said: "The people I've spoken to in New York say things like, 'I want to embrace simplicity, but that doesn't mean that I don't care about fashion. I like shopping, I like wearing makeup, I like all of the traps, so to speak, but that doesn't make me a hypocrite.' "
WHILE the contradiction of a glossy magazine packed with fashion as it promotes downsizing has hard-core simplifiers gritting their teeth, Ms. Taylor says that it still reflects a widespread desire to relax the pace of life. She says many parents are alarmed at the sway commercialization has over their children. In a recent poll by the center, 87 percent of parents said their offspring were too materialistic.
This is a concern for Vicki Madden and Jim Ebersole of Park Slope, Brooklyn, who are raising Ms. Madden's 8-year-old son, Jacob, and have a 3-week-old baby of their own, Samuel.
Ms. Madden, who teaches "very part time," and Mr. Ebersole, who works for a company that ships fine art, have a budget of $200 a week for food, transportation, entertainment and other expenses, not counting rent and insurance. They track their spending in minute detail, cracking down on casual expenditures, like a morning latte, that many take for granted.
Yet striving for simplicity in New York can be lonely. "You're definitely swimming against the tide," Ms. Madden said.
The philosophy can also complicate social life. Jean Thilmany, 33, who writes for writes for the trade publication Mechanical Engineering, says for her friends, a typical night out involves "spending $9 for a movie and then going out for an expensive dinner."
"I'm constantly trying to get out of dinner invitations," said Ms. Thilmany, who lives in a railroad flat in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where country and jazz records clutter the shelves and a stacked pair of old suitcases serves as a coffee table. "I usually make an excuse, like that I'm having money problems. I don't feel comfortable telling people about it. I just feel like I have to get into a whole political thing that's not going to be appreciated."
Ms. Thilmany, a soft-spoken blond with pale features and a taste for prowling vintage clothing stores, came to voluntary simplicity after a disconcerting stint at a paper covering the retail industry, where she "started to become aware of how many ads there are, and all the ways one is manipulated to buy."
It's a particular issue in New York, she said, where ever-present billboards are much more intrusive than in her native Minneapolis.
Which leads to this question: Why live in New York at all if simplicity is what you're after? Isn't it a bit like moving to the hills of Montana to become a stockbroker?
The answer, simplifiers say, is that they live here for much the same reason as anyone else: the culture, the diversity, the creative energy. They say that inflated housing costs aside, New York is a great place to live cheaply. A car is unnecessary, and inexpensive ethnic restaurants abound, along with free concerts and art galleries.
Also, living in the shadow of big spenders has its benefits, like thrift shops where designer goods can be found with the tags still attached. There is plenty of free stuff for the taking, too.
Roger Kaufman, who used to run a graphic design business and now works as a home health care aide, said he had collected many a treasure discarded by fellow tenants at his Bay Ridge apartment building.
"I went from one TV to three," he said. "And I have cast iron and Pyrex cookware beyond belief."

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS for ELIZABETH WARREN;
Bankruptcy Borne of Misfortune, Not Excess

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
A DECADE ago, in a widely praised analysis of bankruptcy filings, three scholars destroyed the myth that most of those seeking refuge from creditors were blue-collar workers. People in every occupation go bankrupt in rough proportion to their numbers, they found.
Now, in "The Fragile Middle Class" (Yale University Press, 2000), the same three writers -- Elizabeth Warren, Teresa A. Sullivan and Jay Lawrence Westbrook -- have refined their research and shown that behind most bankruptcy filings lies misfortune, not profligate living. 
 Ms. Warren, a Harvard Law School professor, says the findings suggest that the recent slight decline in bankruptcy filings nationwide is misleading. The next time the business cycle hits bottom, she said, many people who are now solidly employed may find themselves out of work with bankruptcy as their only recourse. Following are excerpts from a recent conversation.
 DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

Q. What did your latest analysis reveal about the finances of middle-class Americans?
 
A. The number of middle-class families declaring complete financial failure exploded from 313,000 in 1980 to 1,281,000 in 1999. And they were much deeper in debt. In 1981, these people owed nonmortgage debts equal to nine months of income, compared to more than 22 months in 1997.
 
Q. Don't people file for bankruptcy because they misused credit, lived beyond their means?
 
A. In the same way that dead bodies help pathologists understand illness in a living population, the people in bankruptcy help us learn about the economic risks facing families generally. Many people in bankruptcy were solid bill payers until something knocked their legs out from under them. For two-thirds of these people, it was loss of a job, for 40 percent it was a serious medical problem and for 20 percent it was the economic fallout of divorce.
Some were loaded up with debt already, but many others were swamped trying to survive joblessness, illness or divorce -- risks which all middle-class Americans face. The bankrupt debtors are the ones who didn't survive economically.
 
Q. You and your colleagues write that in the last two decades, government policies have shifted risks from capital to labor. What does that mean for families?
 
A. The American economy has benefited from agile companies that can quickly shed or add workers, often on a contract basis without fringe benefits such as health insurance. But this agility for companies brought vulnerability for workers, through interrupted employment and medical bills not covered by insurance.
The question we face as a society is how much of the economic risk of job loss and medical problems should be borne individually by each family and how much should be spread among everyone. The portion of families who are failing economically in this new environment has increased by fourfold over the past two decades, and we need to recognize that there is no free lunch, that the new policies that made companies agile also impose costs.
 
Q. You write that it makes sound economic sense to have a two-income family. Why?
 
A. Two incomes represent the only strategy most people have to spread the risk of unemployment or catastrophic medical bills. Our data show that if either spouse is unemployed, the chance that the family will be in bankruptcy skyrockets by about 320 percent. Following divorce, the chances of filing bankruptcy triple, and that risk falls again, statistically, only when a divorced woman remarries. The bankruptcy data show that a two-earner family is not a matter of choice, but of economic survival.
 
Q. So is there a way out of this through individual action or changes in government policy?
 
A. Bankruptcy is a solution invoked one at a time by families who have fallen through the social safety net. The next time the economy contracts we will see the disastrous effect of allowing 125 percent debt-consolidation mortgages and allowing lenders to charge rates of interest that were illegal just 20 years ago. Bankruptcies will explode and we will all pay the price for this folly.
Better unemployment insurance would help, and so would bankruptcy rules that let families survive and rebuild. If we are reluctant to close some of the holes in the social safety net for families, then we might be better off leaving the bankruptcy system alone.
As it is now, bankruptcy is the classic American free-market deal -- debtors and creditors can do whatever they like, with bankruptcy as the "reset" button if things go badly. Everyone takes chances on that result.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends;
A Rising Tide, but Some Boats Rise Higher Than Others

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
FOR the labor movement, Public Enemy No. 1 has long been the nation's growing income gap. John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, frequently complains in speeches that the economic boom under Mr. Clinton has left millions of hard-working Americans behind and that corporate chieftains have rewarded themselves richly while downsizing their work forces and clamping down on wages.
To fan the flames of blue-collar and white-collar discontent, the labor federation has set up a Web site (www.paywatch.org) that shows workers how many hundreds of times more the C.E.O.'s at their companies earn than they do. 
 And now comes Vice President Al Gore, who has borrowed much of labor's class-edged, us-against-them rhetoric, with an eye to making America's steel-mill workers and truck drivers feel enthusiastic about his candidacy. Mr. Gore rails against the powerful and declares himself the champion of working families. Intending to please the have-nots and the have-littles, Mr. Gore says he will oppose "a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else." In his embrace of labor, Mr. Gore plans to speak alongside Mr. Sweeney in Pittsburgh tommorow, Labor Day.
But while co-opting some A.F.L.-C.I.O. rhetoric (Mr. Sweeney's favorite phrase is "working families"), Mr. Gore steers clear of the income gap, which only widened on his and President Clinton's watch.
While the Clinton administration points to statistics showing that the gap has grown far more slowly than under Presidents Reagan and Bush, recent trends are still daunting. Last year, it took 100 million of the lowest earning Americans to equal the after-tax dollars of the top 1 percent. In 1977, it only took 49 million of the lowest earners to equal the top 1 percent.
Another politically embarrassing nugget: the bottom four-fifths of households -- numbering 217 million -- took a thinner slice of the nation's economic pie last year, 50 percent, than in 1977, when it was 56 percent. One reason, according to data from the Congressional Budget Office, was that nine-tenths of the growth in the economic pie since then went to the richest 1 percent of households, which last year averaged $515,600 in after-tax income, up from $234,700 in 1977.
With the campaign heating up, labor leaders have been bringing up the income gap less frequently, partly because focusing on it might embarrass their preferred candidate. In an interview, Mr. Sweeney said that he had not forgotten the issue, but that many of the forces spurring the gap were largely beyond the control of the Democratic administration. For instance, rapid technological change and the decline in manufacturing have wiped out millions of unskilled jobs and have thus held down wages for many low-wage workers.
Mr. Sweeney praised the Clinton-Gore team for pressing for legislation that would reduce the income gap, both pre-tax and after-tax. He cited the administration's push for a higher minimum wage, more money for job training and billions of dollars for an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. president added that he expected Gov. George W. Bush to do considerably less than Mr. Gore to help middle-income and low-income Americans. Mr. Bush has repeatedly asserted that his proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut will do far more for the middle class than Mr. Gore's proposal for a smaller, focused tax cut.
Last week Mr. Bush campaigned with a $40,000-a-year teacher and high school coach from Louisiana, Andrew Beechac, who hailed Mr. Bush's tax proposal, saying: "We all want tax relief, especially for my family and for middle America around the country. We really need this plan."
Geoffrey Garin, a pollster who often advises the A.F.L.-C.I.O., predicted that workers concerned about the income gap would be unlikely to favor Mr. Bush. "The concern about Bush among A.F.L.-C.I.O. members," he said, "is that he will be a rich man's president and will have the kinds of policies that are designed to let the well-to-do have all the benefits of the economy. And they think Gore will be much more likely to spread the benefits around."
As evidence that Mr. Bush's policies would widen the gap, labor leaders point to his proposal to allow individual states to opt out of any increase in the minimum wage beyond the current $5.15 an hour.
Some unions -- most notably the Teamsters, one of the few not to endorse Mr. Gore -- are not willing to give the vice president a pass on the swelling income gap. For these unions, globalization and freer trade are among the biggest factors behind the widening gap. James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters' president, has often argued that trade liberalization measures, like the administration-backed China trade bill, encourage a flood of imports from low-wage countries and an exodus of American jobs. These developments, Mr. Hoffa said, and many free-trade economists acknowledge, help hold down blue-collar wages and thereby worsen the income gap.
Mr. Sweeney has sought to persuade the Teamsters that the best way to reduce income disparities is to elect a Democrat. "Many of the initiatives the administration has taken to spread the wealth more fairly, like increasing the minimum wage, have consistently been blocked by the Republican leadership in the Congress," he said.

HEADLINE: TALKING MONEY with JOHNNIE L. COCHRAN JR.;
Finding a 'Dream Team' for His Finances

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
BILL COSBY has a jet named Camille, for his wife, and even Oprah got a jet," Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. said recently over lunch at City Hall, a restaurant near his law office in Lower Manhattan. "She wanted a plane just like Bill Cosby's. It's, like, amazing. He goes to sleep on the plane. It's wonderful."
Clearly dazzled by the luxury of personal transportation, Mr. Cochran has studied the subject. He is now getting a jet, too. 
 Mr. Cochran, who broke into the top-level national law leagues when he successfully defended O. J. Simpson against charges that he murdered his former wife, is now hitting the major money leagues as well, and he has the status-symbol issue down pat.
"We're not getting a GII," he conceded, his voice showing a tinge of disappointment that he is not buying a Gulfstream model favored by many chief executives. "My plane won't be that big -- more like a Hawker or a Citation."
But Mr. Cochran, showing his newfound financial prudence, will not make the purchase rashly. His law firm, which is building a national practice, is still deciding whether to buy or lease the plane. "We are going to see how often we would use it," he said.
Success is hardly new to Mr. Cochran, who is now 62. Long before his disciplined, relentless cross-examination and his flamboyant attire became a daily staple of the grueling O. J. Simpson murder trial, he was a prominent lawyer with a busy criminal and civil practice. His performance at the televised trial, however, made Mr. Cochran, a member of the "dream team" defense, a celebrity in his own right.
But it did not leave him as rich as it left him famous. Now he is trying to close that gap, adopting a new money-management philosophy that includes putting more money into the stock market.
His success "allowed him to move up the lawyer food chain," said his accountant, John Baiardi, a partner at Mitchell & Titus, the nation's largest minority-owned accounting firm.
Mr. Cochran no longer takes criminal cases, but he has a thriving personal practice that includes intellectual property, personal-injury and business lawsuits. And last year, in a move that leverages his brand name, he merged his firm with Schneider, Kleinick, Weitz, Damashek & Shoot, a personal-injury firm based in New York. Partners share the legal fees in cases they win together.
Mr. Cochran says his net worth is more than $5 million -- in retirement plans, private investments, a sprinkling of stocks and his major holding, real estate. His properties include homes in Los Angeles, including beach homes in Marina del Rey for himself and his parents, a new condominium in Manhattan where he now spends one-third of his time, and two apartment buildings in West Hollywood that he bought as an investment. That net worth figure does not include the value of his law firm.
But he may be about to make a quantum leap.
Within five years, his net worth could soar to $25 million or even $50 million, Mr. Baiardi said, as fees roll in from the exploding demand for his legal services.
To which Mr. Cochran replied, "I hope we will do that well."
Lester Brickman, a law firm compensation expert and a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardoza School of Law, agreed that the personal-injury fees could contribute to a bump-up in Mr. Cochran's net worth. Lawyers in that area are very selective about the cases they take on, have a high success rate and often reap big financial rewards. But maybe not as high as Mr. Baiardi suggested. "It is in the realm of possibility that Cochran can net over $10 million a year," Mr. Brickman said.
By contrast, Mr. Cochran was earning $1 million or so annually by the time the Simpson trial ended in 1995.
"Before, I was interested in earning money," Mr. Cochran said. "Now, I'm interested in what happens to it. I don't want to be haphazard -- I want a team I can count on."
WITH the help of people like Earl G. Graves Sr., the publisher of Black Enterprise magazine and leading black entrepreneur, whom he had met through some business dealings, he is tapping into the African-American financial establishment in New York. The goal is to help build that dream team and to create a network of relationships in the financial sphere, much as he once did in the legal establishment.
Mr. Cochran's new focus on finances started in early 1997, when he decided that he had been spending so much time in Manhattan for his program on Court TV that he ought to put down roots. So he bought a pied a terre on West 57th Street in Midtown for about $750,000.
After settling in, he called Mr. Graves. "He is one of my gurus," Mr. Cochran said. "Earl is into wealth."
Mr. Graves said Mr. Cochran peppered him with questions. "He said, 'Tell me what I need to know in town,' " Mr. Graves recalled. First, he steered him to Carver Bancorp, the largest black-run bank in the country, where Mr. Cochran's personal-injury clients could borrow money. "Then Johnnie told me, 'The way you look is the way I ought to look.' " So I sent him to the John Atchison hair salon on West 56th Street. He told me it was too expensive, so I sent him a gift certificate."
As for Mr. Cochran's finances, "I asked him, 'What are you going to do about your own money?' " Mr. Graves added. "And he asked me who I should invest with." Mr. Graves introduced him to Bert N. Mitchell of Mitchell & Titus and other black financial leaders.
"New York has been a real eye-opener for me," Mr. Cochran said. "Most of the people in L.A. who have money are entertainers. And L.A. is more spread out -- here you talk, you find out what other guys are doing. In New York, everything is geared to business."
The team that Mr. Cochran has assembled is ethnically diverse. Guided by Mr. Baiardi, who is white, and Jeri Norris, a black financial consultant and a stockbroker at Merrill Lynch, Mr. Cochran is educating himself about more sophisticated investing strategies. "We didn't grow up on Wall Street, but we should move there now," he said, remembering something that Jesse Jackson said while trying to encourage blacks to invest.
"I should have gotten into the stock market earlier," Mr. Cochran said over the recent two-hour lunch of seafood and creamed spinach.
Ms. Norris is seeing to that. Wanting to preserve Mr. Cochran's capital, she said, "we want a mix of old-economy and technology stocks." Among her picks for his portfolio are Sun Microsystems, J. P. Morgan and the American International Group. Her long-term goal for him is 70 percent equities, 20 percent bonds and 10 percent cash.
Mr. Cochran said he preferred to leave the decisions to Ms. Norris: "My wife and I don't want to wake up worrying about the market," he said. But he did make one choice: last year, he bought about $150,000 worth of Time Warner stock. He knew the company because it owned Court TV, where for two years he had a talk show on legal issues, but he does even know today what the value of that investment is -- except that the stock has gone up.
Though he does not want the final responsibility of making investment decisions, Mr. Cochran wants to know the issues and speaks often to Ms. Norris. To cement the relationship, he and his wife recently took Ms. Norris and her husband to the theater and to dinner at Aquavit in Midtown Manhattan.
Mr. Cochran is also listening to advice about his real estate and about the kinds of deals in which he invests. Gone are the days of jumping into deals heard about at cocktail parties. Mr. Cochran says future deals will be more carefully vetted by Mr. Baiardi, "who is my sounding board."
IF Mr. Cochran cannot resist gambling in venture capital and private equity, Mr. Baiardi wants him to go only with blue-chip recommendations. "It is one thing if your brother-in-law introduces you to someone who has a deal," Mr. Baiardi said. "It is another thing when you go to an investment bank and they do some private equity."
Mr. Baiardi would also like Mr. Cochran to sell the two apartment buildings in West Hollywood. "If you are in real estate, you have to collect your own rents," Mr. Baiardi said. "It's one thing to own commercial property that Trump manages. It is another thing to own rental properties and collect rent."
Mr. Baiardi is not having a problem convincing Mr. Cochran. Though real estate had represented his main investment for years, the risks became apparent in the late 1980's. "You never thought about the stock market when I started buying real estate," he recalled. "You just assumed real estate was stable and would keep going up. Then it went down, so that was unsettling."
A Merrill Lynch team suggested that Mr. Cochran borrow the entire purchase price of his new condominium against his existing real estate, rather than raising cash to make a large down payment. The move let him deduct all the interest and reduce taxes. "His first instinct was to pay off as much as possible," Ms. Norris recalled.
Until now. "My first thing is always to pay things off," Mr. Cochran said. But he said he had learned that "you can get deductions and it does not always pay to pay it off."
"I really wanted to get good tax advice," he added.
Mr. Cochran is even toning down his lifestyle a bit -- to be less showy. No more Rolls-Royces, like the one he drives around Los Angeles. Today, he said, he likes "stealth wealth -- Jeeps, all that stuff."
"I think now, where I am, I would not drive a Rolls in New York," he added. "But as a young man, it was a sign of success. My clients wanted to see that. Driving a Toyota or a Mazda was terrible. If you didn't have a Rolls, you weren't very successful."
He has given up his Rolexes, too. "After a period of time, that's not as important," he said.
Mr. Cochran has also become more pragmatic about his personal life, which was once in disarray. The other night, he said, he and his wife of 15 years, Dale, a marketing executive who is now starting a new business, were watching an episode on HBO's "Sex and the City" that dealt with prenuptial agreements. "I mentioned a prenup and we laughed about it," he said. "But absolutely I would have one now. My estate has gone up, and I think in this world, that's the way to go."
Mr. Cochran's current life is a far cry from a childhood that began in Shreveport, La., where his father was once a sharecropper. But the family was ambitious. By the time he was 6, his father and mother had packed up their four children and moved to California, where the elder Mr. Cochran eventually became a successful insurance salesman.
The Cochrans were also determined that their children receive a good education. They sent Mr. Cochran to Los Angeles High School, which had a far better academic reputation than the school closer to his home.
VISITING the homes of wealthy white friends whom he met at school was a revelation for Mr. Cochran, who grew up without television or other entree to that world. "I had no way to know how they lived before that," he said. "Remember, there was a big class thing. How would you know unless you worked for them?" he added, speaking of his friends' families.
And though Mr. Cochran made friends at the school whom he has kept until this day, he said he did not bring them to his house.
His parents encouraged him to become a professional. His mother wanted him to be a doctor, but Mr. Cochran thought that law would suit him better, letting him use his skills of persuasion.
In 1963, after graduating from Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, he became the first black law clerk in the Los Angeles city attorney's office, making $608 a month. His job involved prosecuting people, primarily black, who were charged with avoiding arrest. But that, he came to believe, was aimed at keeping them from filing civil suits against the city for compensation for their injuries.
By 1965, he and Gerald Lenoir, a seasoned criminal lawyer, had started a practice together. Their first windfall came fast. When rioting exploded in Los Angeles's poor, mainly black, Watts district, Mr. Cochran was alone in the office. As the rioting escalated and the police began making arrests, clients came to the office until 11 or 12 at night, putting retainer fees on his desk -- in cash.
"That was the first time I became aware: 'Geez, you can make a lot of money doing this,' " Mr. Cochran said. "People would come with $3,000 or $4,000. It was sad. You had a weird feeling. The city was going up in smoke. But it was the first time I knew the practice of law could be remunerative."
Mr. Cochran learned quickly that criminal defense lawyers need the money up front. "They used to say, 'Get the money while the tears are falling,' " he recalled. Otherwise, he added, an acquitted client would say, "I was innocent anyway," and a convicted one would ask, "What did you do for me?"
His practice expanded to civil cases, including police brutality suits. "Later, I started getting the big fees from contingency cases," he said. "You get one-third after you win, so you got to win."
In those years, Mr. Cochran worried a lot about the cash flow, often asking whether any checks had come in while he was in court.
Still, he set parameters. When a known drug dealer showed up with a suitcase filled with $600,000 in cash, Mr. Cochran refused to represent him. "It was the most money I had ever seen," he said. "But I knew drugs were killing kids in the black community, and I didn't take the case. I knew where the money had come from."
Over time, as word spread about his successes, the money poured in. And Mr. Cochran was not shy about spending his earnings on his family and personal luxuries. "I would buy clothes and nice cars," he said. At one point, he had six fancy cars. "It wasn't always wise," he added.
He spent money on a handful of deals, involving oil, a supper club, radio stations and other things, with mixed results.
He also spent a lot of money on an extramarital relationship, according to "Life After Johnnie Cochran," a 1995 book by his former wife, Barbara Cochran Berry. In 1965, he started a relationship with Patricia Sikora, who would become the mother of his only son, Ms. Berry wrote. In 1973, according to Ms. Berry, he took out a loan to help pay for a house he was buying for Ms. Sikora, and he tried to get Ms. Berry to sign an agreement that she had no rights to the house, an accusation that Mr. Cochran has denied. In the view of Ms. Berry, with whom he has two daughters, he used his money as a form of manipulation.
"Money and the gifts it bought were the sum and substance of what a woman had a right to expect from a man," she wrote, interpreting what he conveyed to her. "This need of women for money and security were tools to be used in their control, to keep them in their place."
Mr. Cochran said: "This is ridiculous. My poor dear ex-wife -- it is not true. She saw a chance to write a book and to try to make some money."
Even after the Cochrans divorced in 1977 and Mr. Cochran married his current wife in 1985, he continued to send Ms. Sikora $4,000 a month, according to a palimony suit that Ms. Sikora filed in 1995 after, she said, Mr. Cochran cut her off.
Mr. Cochran said he sent the money because "I was supporting my son." Now 27, the son, Jonathan Cochran, is on his own, working for the California Highway Patrol.
The suit was dismissed and is on appeal.
Mr. Cochran's financial contributions extended to other family members as well. For years, he helped his parents and a brother; his widowed father now lives with him in Los Angeles.
He even sent his first wife a television set as a wedding present when she remarried. He has also given money away, most recently creating the Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. Art Fund, financed with several hundred thousand dollars to help minority artists.
Though he spent his money liberally, his investment strategy was conservative. (He agrees with a friend who once told him that his ties were more flamboyant than his investing style.) He stuck with real estate and he avoided the stock market -- a strategy that several experts say is common among blacks.
"The stock market is still the easiest way to get into the wealth game," said Brooke Stephens, author of "Talking Dollars and Making Sense: A Wealth-Building Guide for African-Americans." "But many blacks don't trust it and don't understand it."
Mr. Cochran said his conservatism was in part a result of memories from childhood that left him worried about taxes. "You would hear stories about Joe Louis and Sammy Davis Jr." he recalled. "They took Sammy's house away from him. And I would think: I am never going to be like that. I want to pay my taxes."
"You grow up with certain fears," he added. "You want to be secure. If you have been poor, you understand that if you worked real hard, you don't want to go back and be there anymore. Tax problems have always been a big problem for people who became successful in our community. I vowed that would never be a problem."
He sees himself as still somewhat of a target. "I get audited every year," he said. "I am getting audited right now. They read about my book deal," he said, referring to his advance for "Journey to Justice" of about $3 million. He added that they say, " 'Where is the money,' as though you are not going to pay taxes."
But over the next decade, Mr. Cochran's biggest problem will not be taxes, but how to invest all the wealth he is accruing after he pays his taxes. And he seems to be well on his way to solving that problem.

Acid Tongue in Cheek

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Bush campaign has dissolved into a whiny puddle. The Austin team put out a press release Friday bawling that Joe Lieberman was a big meanie to compare Governor Bush to Barney Rubble.
You'd think, after the risible rift between Dan Quayle and Murphy Brown, that Republicans would know better than to whinge about fictional characters. 
 W.'s attempt to be nasty and nice at the same time is so lame, it's making me miss Lee Atwater. At least Atwater knew where he wanted to be -- in the gutter.
The cocky, jagged-edged strategist, a jogging partner and political ally of W. during the '88 campaign, would have snickered at the oxymoron some Bushies have used to describe the ad campaign against Al Gore: soft negative.
When Atwater ran Poppy's race against Michael Dukakis, he bragged on a less euphemistic approach: "Attack and destroy!"
His fellow dark prince of strategy, Roger Ailes, who helped Atwater turn Willie Horton into a bludgeon, was once asked by a Time reporter if they had any qualms about using Mr. Horton in an ad. "The only question," Ailes replied breezily, "is whether we depict Willie Horton with a knife in his hand or without it."
You can't insist that a scalding ad is soft without looking foolish. Or, as W. himself so memorably put it after John McCain attacked him in the primary: "You can't take the high horse and claim the low road."
The Republicans' new ad has a female narrator sarcastically mocking Mr. Gore's image on TV as he says he "took the initiative in creating the Internet" and as he hangs with Buddhist monks.
The ad is designed to rip Mr. Gore's truthfulness and ethics. Yet on Friday Mr. Bush defended it by parroting his aides' assertions that it was merely "humorous" and "tongue in cheek."
In two short weeks, W. and Al have switched roles, and it's making the Bush campaign nuts. Al is now the sunny one, crowing to The Washington Post that "the wind is at our backs and it's filling our sails." He's 10 points ahead, according to a Newsweek poll. And he's now seen as smarter and better-looking than W., according to a Gallup poll, and also the one voters would rather dine with. Thanks to the big smooch, women have finally cottoned to the Democratic nominee. And suddenly W., who had been loftily promising to restore civility to politics, seems like Slashing, Opportunistic Guy.
Thrown off his strut, W. veered between impatience and sentimentality talking Friday to The Times's Alison Mitchell and Frank Bruni, and grew misty over the "amazing experience" of running for president.
Besides the cheap-shot ad, W. looks sulky about setting the debates. The Bush family has a proud history of aversion to debates, which don't suit them because of their curious relationship with grammar and because they feel they should be trusted to govern without having to prove themselves.
But there was something surreal in watching the candidate who is so allergic to details dwelling on every detail of the debate format, from the location (nothing adjacent to anything named after a Democratic president) to the questioners (Larry King would be best) to the furniture (a table instead of podiums would be nice).
And then there was the dead weight known as Dick Cheney. Mr. Cheney finally faced up to his potential conflict of interest, announcing that, if elected, he would forfeit Halliburton stock options worth about $3.5 million.
He also released his tax returns, showing why $3.5 million was a piddling sacrifice. His income went from $258,394 in 1992, when he was the Bush secretary of defense who helped direct the Persian Gulf war to save a ritzy gas station called Kuwait and keep American oil prices down, to $4,423,289 in 1999, when he was an avatar of Big Oil.
The Gore campaign might think about using that Cheney financial statement in an ad. Mr. Cheney didn't fare too shabbily in the Democratic economy. His annual income multiplied 17 times during the Clinton-Gore administration. He got a whopping $20 million in 10 years and gave a measly 1 percent to charity.
But you can see why the guy wants to give himself a bigger tax cut.

HEADLINE: Learning by Just Being There

BYLINE: By Susan Mayer and Christopher Jencks; Susan Mayer, a professor at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy, is the author of "What Money Can't Buy." Christopher Jencks teaches at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.

 BODY:
"Accountability" has become the favored solution to the nation's educational problems. For schools, accountability usually means that standardized tests identify failing schools, which then become candidates for administrative shakeups, closure or voucher programs.
For students, accountability typically means requiring anyone with low test scores to attend summer school. Students whose scores do not improve may have to repeat a grade. Some states plan to withhold high school diplomas from low scorers, although that threat may be politically difficult to carry out. 
 These stabs at accountability rely entirely on standardized tests, which seem like a reasonable measure. After all, if students aren't learning, something is wrong. But test scores should not be the only measure of success.
Contrary to what many assume, students can benefit from attending school even when their test scores do not improve. Among men and women in their late 20's who worked full time throughout 1998, those with high school diplomas but no post-secondary education typically earned $5,000 more than high school dropouts.
Sounds good. But test scores have little to do with this difference in wages. Numerous economists have shown that test scores, on average, account for no more than $1,500 of the $5,000 difference between high school graduates and dropouts.
Of course, book learning is not useless. Students who do well on tests tend to make more money than those who don't. But test scores are only one factor among many that affect wages, and simply staying in school, regardless of test scores, changes people in ways that employers value.
We social scientists do not know what specifically accounts for the wage gap between high school graduates and dropouts. But if employers are asked why graduates make better workers than dropouts, they give a multitude of answers: Graduates have a better attitude; they are more responsible; they have better people skills.
There is also evidence that when schools change these character traits, the result is long-lasting.
Model preschool programs almost always raise children's test scores, but after a few years the advantage fades. Yet in the long run, students who attend good preschools have fewer behavioral problems and are less likely to be placed in special education classes, less likely to drop out of high school and less likely to become teenage mothers.
Because schooling helps students in many ways, measuring performance solely through test scores can do harm as well as good. If teachers know that their school may be closed unless scores rise, they may not spend much time trying to make students more considerate, trustworthy or respectful.
Likewise, denying diplomas to high school students who fail a standardized test may backfire. A recent national study by Brian Jacob, a doctoral student at the University of Chicago, shows that high-stakes testing increases the odds that students with very low scores will drop out.
 So how should we measure school performance? While some schools create a climate in which students learn to show up, hand in their homework and meet their other obligations, others do not.
We need to take such differences into account. We should ask not just whether a school imparts knowledge, but also how many students stick around until graduation and how many complete college applications. We should assess how students behave by asking how many students come to school with guns and how many have babies before graduating.
Woody Allen famously quipped that 90 percent of life is showing up. Students who finish high school do better than dropouts partly because they have learned this lesson.

HEADLINE: Editorial Observer;
Attracting New Immigrants to the Heartland

BYLINE: By VERLYN KLINKENBORG

 BODY:
Iowa isn't a crowded place. It wasn't crowded when I was growing up there in the 1950's and early 60's, and it isn't crowded now. In 1960, when I was in third grade, the state population was 2,757,537 and still slowly climbing, as it had been all century, until it reached a peak of just less than three million people in 1980.
Yet things haven't been as static in Iowa as these figures suggest. The way that Iowa isn't crowded has changed. The number of third graders has plummeted, and the population as a whole has gotten older. The percentage of the population over 80 is larger in Iowa than in any other state. Iowa is the only state besides Florida with more people over 75 than under 5. 
 That is one of the reasons the state -- which has nearly always experienced annual net migration losses -- wants to encourage immigration. A plan to do just that, produced by a bipartisan governor's commission called the 2010 Committee, has caused an uproar in a state that is overwhelmingly white. In fact, the commission's report merely recognizes a demographic reality. Without immigration, the state's labor force will steadily dwindle. The only reason Iowa's population has not fallen further is because of immigrants who have come from Mexico, Vietnam, Bosnia and elsewhere. The greatest demand for labor comes from industries like meat packing.
The population problem in Iowa isn't merely that its residents are getting old and its young people are leaving. The problem is tied directly to the character of agriculture in the state. In 1960 there were 174,707 farms in Iowa, down from a peak of around 215,000 in 1930. Last year there were about 96,000 farms, though the amount of farmland in cultivation had barely changed. There are 15 million hogs in Iowa, but they are raised on fewer than half as many farms as just a decade ago.
It can be hard to grasp the implications of a shift that large. Think of a farm, for a moment, not as a tract of land or so many acres of corn and soybeans. Think of a farm instead as a constellation of people, each of whom has ties to a local community -- to churches and schools, to banks and farm-implement dealers, to co-ops and Lions Clubs. In 1960, small towns were thriving not on the prosperity of town residents alone but on the prosperity -- and the population -- of farms in the adjoining countryside.
Now half of those farms are gone, their groves cut down, their houses bulldozed, their constellations of people dispersed. Year by year, the size of farms increases and their work force diminishes. The towns are very quiet, except the ones lucky enough to hear the roar of enormous grain driers at the elevator out by the railroad tracks. School districts have consolidated, and small-town business is just a ghost of itself. It is not uncommon to come across a sense of disinheritance among Iowans, especially those living in small towns. The bond that tied them to the farmland around them -- a bond that was social as well as economic -- has to a striking degree been severed. There is no one on the farms, and the towns have no one to serve except their aging residents.
All of this has come about because of a faith -- an unproved faith -- that the only way for agriculture to prosper is for farms to become bigger and bigger. There is no question that Iowa raises vastly more corn and soybeans than it did in 1960. But at what cost? Farm prices are as low as they have ever been, and farmers now pray for emergency funding from Congress the way they pray for rain. One of the indisputable results of large-scale corporate farming in Iowa has been the depopulation of the countryside. An agricultural job in Iowa is now a meat-packing job, highly dangerous, badly paid and emblematic of an approach to farming that will serve Iowa's new immigrants as badly as it has served its longtime residents.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ELECTORATE;
For Last Dance, Candidates Eye The Wallflower

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: TOLEDO, Ohio, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Labor Day is the unofficial opening of the general election campaign, but for most voters the race is already over. Strategists on both sides agree that more than 90 percent of the electorate has by now settled on either Gov. George W. Bush or Vice President Al Gore.
That leaves the outcome in November hinging on a sliver of expected voters -- fewer than 10 percent -- who truly have not made up their minds. This narrow pool of voters reflects what pollsters say has been an appreciable shift in the electorate in the two weeks since the Democratic convention: Mr. Gore consolidated the base vote in his party, something Mr. Bush accomplished weeks, if not months, earlier. 
 Both sides will still strive to ensure the highest possible turnout from their most faithful partisans. But the campaigns are now devoting their two most precious commodities -- time and money -- in the remaining two months to persuading up-in-the-air voters to side with them.
Of the 148 million registered voters, 103 million are expected to vote. Of those, an estimated 5 million are undecided. But if this pool is further narrowed to include undecided voters in important battleground states, the actual number of voters that both camps -- and to a lesser degree the third-party contenders -- are fighting over may be fewer than one million. That is minuscule, especially when contrasted with a voting-age population of more than 205 million.
"That's the gold," said John Zogby, a pollster who is not affiliated with either party. "Kind of sobering, isn't it? Three-quarters of a million to a million voters in 10 states."
The competition over these swing voters is driving the political calculations of each side. It explains why Mr. Bush traveled to Ohio today to visit a high school -- his 100th school visit -- and in fact spent all week promoting his education plan. It also explains the Gore campaign's decision to celebrate the Labor Day weekend with a 24-hour "American Workathon," for which the vice president will travel to five cities to spend time with people who are working.
The push and pull over swing voters is particularly intense and of utmost consequence this year because both sides acknowledge that the electoral dynamic has changed significantly, with polls now showing a dead-even race between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush. For months leading to the party conventions, Mr. Bush clung to a small but unmistakable lead. In some current polls, Mr. Gore has even pulled ahead.
Now, Mr. Gore's aides, citing private and public polls in several states, are confidently declaring for the first time that they are leading in the Electoral College tally. "We're ahead substantially," said Tad Devine, a top strategist for Mr. Gore. "I've been surprised at the depth of the movement to Gore."
Karl Rove, the architect of the Bush strategy, conceded that Mr. Gore had made inroads. Yet Mr. Rove disputed the surveys cited by the Gore camp and insisted that the Texas governor was still dominant in the Electoral College. But, sounding a bit frustrated by questions about his candidate's potency in the polls, Mr. Rove added: "Tune in, man. We've been saying for about three weeks that the race will essentially be dead even by Labor Day. Welcome to reality!"
While the undecided voters are not a monolith, surveys show that they do share some characteristics: More than half consider themselves independents. They are mostly married, between the ages of 45 and 64. They hold moderate stands on issues. They voted overwhelmingly for President Clinton's re-election. They are generally from working-class families in which both parents work and the income is between $30,000 and $50,000. Many live in suburbs in the Midwest, and some in rural areas. More than half are women.
One swing voter is Francis Steffee, 76, a retired food services worker in Kent, Ohio. "This one is hard to figure out," she said. "One day I'm leaning for one and the next day, well, I'm leaning for the other. I thought I'd wait until they have the debates and see what goes on."
Whom does she favor today? "I'm thinking of Gore," she said, explaining that she was put off by Mr. Bush's promises about improving education. "Everybody says they're going to do this and do that. You know it never happens that way."
Arland Van Kirk, 68, a retired worker in a carburetor shop in Lock Haven, Pa., also has not decided. She identifies more with Republicans than Democrats, she said, but voted for Mr. Clinton twice -- and is torn between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore.
"I think they are both trying too hard," Ms. Van Kirk said. "If they'd just give a straight answer on the tough questions, without all the hemming and hawing."
Explaining that she was not inclined to back Mr. Bush, she said: "I never liked Bush the father. I always thought he was too mealy-mouthed." Her problem with Mr. Gore was also one of style. "He sometimes acts like he's Mr. Big," she said.
Even as Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush battle over these voters, the candidates' target audiences are slightly different. Strategists on each side said that among undecided voters, Mr. Bush was aiming at a younger, slightly more upscale pool by promoting measures like privatizing Social Security.
Mr. Bush is struggling to hold on to a chunk of women voters in that swing group who polls show are slipping back to the Democratic fold. That, his advisers said, was the impetus behind his visits to schools because women are particularly supportive of improving schools.
With his emphasis on prescription drugs and protecting Medicare, Mr. Gore is fashioning his appeals for slightly older swing voters who are faring adequately economically but not as well as they would like. Although his campaign has had far more success with women than men, Mr. Gore is trying to eat into the support for Mr. Bush among working-class men.
The Bush campaign has been more aggressive than the Gore operation in homing in on those swing voters.
That relentless focus was on display this week in the northwestern corner of Ohio, a crucial battleground state. After Mr. Bush's plane landed at the Toledo airport, one of his aides told reporters that the media market here had the fourth-largest number of swing voters in the state.
It was no accident that when he arrived, Mr. Bush was greeted by what he called "a real family of four," with an annual income of $50,000, that he said would benefit from his tax cut plan. And it was no accident that on his one stop in Ohio, Mr. Bush headed for Springfield High School in Holland to promote himself as the candidate most dedicated to improving education.
The Bush campaign could afford to be more narrow in aiming at swing voters, Mr. Rove explained, because Republicans rallied behind Mr. Bush faster than Democrats did behind Mr. Gore.
"Elections are won by doing two things: mobilizing your base and winning the independent swing voters," Mr. Rove said. "Our base is mobilized and we're winning independent voters. It's just a question of grinding it out, keeping a focus on the agenda, on your issues -- and pushing it through."
Mr. Devine acknowledged that his campaign has been less surgical in pursuing swing voters. He said that was not because the campaign was still trying to woo core supporters but because at this point "it would be a mistake for us to limit the target audience too narrowly."
"We're casting a pretty wide net," he said. "We're not into laser surgery here. It's not like a piece of direct mail that will land in the last two weeks of the election. We're still very much in a very broad, thematic, formative stage of the election."
While Mr. Bush was in Ohio today, Mr. Gore was stumping in Seattle with a message of his own for the undecided. Rather than specifically refer to a family with the demographics he is seeking to reach -- as did Mr. Bush -- Mr. Gore broadly appealed to voters who acknowledge the nation's prosperity but worry that they have not benefited sufficiently from it.
"We've got to fight to make sure that everybody participates in the prosperity," Mr. Gore said at an outdoor rally in downtown Seattle, "that nobody is left behind."
That Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore are competing over slightly different profiles of swing voters is apparent in their television commercials. Since the Democratic convention, advertising by the Bush campaign and the Republican Party has included images of 40 children or young adults, 18 adults and 15 elderly people, according to an examination by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.
By contrast, in keeping with Mr. Gore's focus on older voters, Ms. Jamieson found that the Gore and Democratic Party advertisements in that same period featured 23 children or young adults, but 56 adults and 25 elderly people.
Given that most voters have made up their minds, it is striking that the campaigns' onslaught of advertising is only beginning in earnest.
Each of the two party nominees receives about $68 million in federal money. So if that money were intended to influence one million voters, that would amount to roughly $136 that both campaigns are spending to sway each of those all-important voters. And while the networks estimate that 50 million people could watch nationally televised candidate debates, the audience the candidates are trying to reach in those debates is far narrower.
For all the emphasis on swing voters, neither camp wants to neglect its own supporters who may not be as loyal -- and could be susceptible to entreaties from the other side. Mr. Rove said that while his campaign's strategy "is principally aimed at swing voters, you want to get some of the weak identifiers on the other side."
But mostly, the campaigns are debating how to find the formula to entice those swing voters. The problem is that while those voters have been polled again and again, no one can say what moves them.
"Neither of these guys," said Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster, "is so strong right now to assume they have the magic answer."
Some voters, of course, are out of reach.
Joe Hesler, 48, a house painter in Collingswood, N.J., said he planned to support Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee. Asked what it would take to change his mind, he laughed and replied: "A million dollars. On my doorstep. In cash."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE DEMOCRATIC RUNNING MATE;
In Praise of the President, Lieberman Is Unabashed Where Gore Is Reticent

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me., Sept. 1

 BODY:
The candidate praises President Clinton's "extraordinary record," crediting the president for the muscular economy. He tells audiences that Mr. Clinton has fought crime. He reminds people that he has been the president's friend for 30 years.
These are not the words of Vice President Al Gore, who rarely mentions Mr. Clinton on the campaign trail. Mr. Gore has spent much of this campaign year trying to put distance between himself and a president whose record, foibles and outsize personality have made him a mixed blessing to his partner and political heir. 
 No, the speaker is Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Mr. Gore's running mate, who was the first Democrat in the Senate to chastise Mr. Clinton for his sexual misbehavior and is sufficiently distant from Buddhist temples, Oval Office dalliances and Arkansas land deals that he does not feel the need to hold the president at arm's length. Mr. Clinton has hardly been a centerpiece of the senator's pitch, but in the weeks since his nomination, it has been clear that Mr. Lieberman feels far freer than Mr. Gore to embrace the president and claim bragging rights to the achievements of his administration.
"For the last eight years, Bill Clinton and Al Gore have led a fight to get tough on violent crime," Mr. Lieberman said on Monday at a union rally in Chicago. Earlier in the day, he had told a gathering of religious leaders, "I'm very proud of this extraordinary record the Clinton-Gore administration has built up."
On Tuesday in Anaheim, Calif., he told the Communications Workers of America that a strong economy and investments in technology were "the kind of change Bill Clinton and Al Gore brought to America," citing their "brilliant leadership." And on Thursday in Portland, Ore., he said, "There's a lot for the president to be proud of."
Mr. Lieberman often mentions Mr. Clinton by name, and even when he does not, the connection is obvious. In one of the segments of his standard stump speech that draws some of his loudest applause and cheers, he rebuts the Republicans who have called Mr. Clinton's two terms a time of squandered opportunities.
"If you're one of the 22 million people who's in a job that was created in the last eight years, you sure know that the last eight years have not been squandered," he said today in Portland, Me. "If you're one of the four million new businesses in America -- two million small businesses -- that have been created in the last eight years, you know they haven't been squandered. If you are one of the millions who've gone from the dependency of welfare to the self-sufficiency of work, you know these last eight years have not been squandered. And if you're one of the other millions who have either bought a new home or refinanced the ones you have because we did turn deficits into surpluses and kept the interest rates down, you know these last eight years have not been squandered."
Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, played down what he conceded were differences in the two running mates' treatment of the president, but even in doing so, he referred to Mr. Clinton only indirectly. "I do think the vice president acknowledges the great success of the last eight years," he said. "Maybe not at every event. But what the vice president has been talking about mostly is about the future."
What to do about Mr. Clinton has posed a dilemma throughout the campaign for Mr. Gore. The vice president has been an unusually influential second-in-command to a popular president during a time of enormous prosperity, but he has had difficulty being seen, as he proclaimed himself at the Democrats' convention in Los Angeles, as "my own man." And his reputation for rectitude has been shaken by the investigation of fund-raising for the 1996 campaign and by association with Mr. Clinton's private behavior.
The Gore campaign has frequently used current or former Clinton administration officials as surrogates in making his case to the reporters. And in Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Gore has a vehicle for boasting about his role in the administration, without doing so himself.
For the Democratic faithful, at least, the praise of the president has been well received. Interviews with people at Mr. Lieberman's rallies found that most agreed with Virginia Minarik, who said in Chicago, "I'm glad he's not running away from Clinton like Gore is, because Clinton's been a great president."
In an interview, Mr. Lieberman was effusive in his praise of Mr. Clinton. "I feel really comfortable doing it, because President Clinton deserves it," he said. "We have become the party of fiscal responsibility and economic growth," an achievement he attributed to "the president and the vice president."
He was careful to distinguish Mr. Clinton's personal behavior, which he deplored so publicly in 1998, from his performance as president.
What few voters realize is that in 1992, before Mr. Clinton chose Mr. Gore as his running mate, he was closer to Mr. Lieberman.
In 1970, while a student at Yale law school, Mr. Clinton worked on Mr. Lieberman's first political campaign, for the state Senate, and they have kept in close touch since. They worked together in the 1980's on the Democratic Leadership Council, committed to pushing the Democratic Party toward the center, and Mr. Lieberman succeeded Mr. Clinton as head of the group.
"I was the first senator outside of Arkansas to endorse him" in 1992, Mr. Lieberman recalled. He spoke of the "extraordinary joy" he felt that year in watching Mr. Clinton succeed in conveying his ideas. "And then, to have the tremendous satisfaction of seeing them work. You know, the extraordinary good times, welfare reform, crime is down. So, you know, that's a remarkable record."

HEADLINE: Lebanon Challenger Takes On Syria, Too

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Lebanon is slipping toward a constitutional crisis -- and a tough early test for Syria's new young leader, Bashar al-Assad -- as it goes into a final round of parliamentary elections on Sunday.
Rafik Hariri, the flamboyant multibillionaire real estate developer, appears poised to roll up a majority in the 128-seat Parliament, probably 70 seats or more, in his effort to come back as prime minister. 
 But President Emile Lahoud, annointed by Syria, which for a decade has been the only real political power here, appears determined, somehow, to block Mr. Hariri from regaining the office he held from 1992 to 1998.
Mr. Hariri threw up showy projects, including rebuilding the downtown devastated by the 15-year civil war, but Mr. Lahoud has accused him of plunging the country into debt and corruption.
The government took a terrific blow in the first round of elections last Sunday in the far north, the Christian heartland, and the Druz mountains, with final tallies showing 41 of the 63 seats going to government critics or candidates allied with Mr. Hariri. Riding a wave of economic discontent, the tycoon has built an imposing set of alliances for the vote Sunday in Beirut, the south and the Bekaa region.
Winding up with a series of packed, emotional street rallies, Mr. Hariri exuded confidence this morning in his huge, ornate palace, as aides and candidates on his ticket scurried about.
"The polls are good," he said. "Tomorrow we will see if they are right. The battle is for Beirut."
Nevertheless, President Lahoud's main political ally, Michel Murr, the powerful interior minister, says no matter how many votes and how much parliamentary support Mr. Hariri gets, he is not coming back.
"Hariri may have become the Gamal Abdel Nasser of the Sunni Muslim sect, and he may be able to sweep Beirut in the elections, but this will not bring him closer to the Grand Serai," he said, referring to the huge stone building that houses the prime minister's office.
"On the contrary, this will push him much farther from the premiership," Mr. Murr was quoted by the newspaper As Safir as having told visitors after last week's voting.
"Even the support of 70 Parliament members will not be enough to get Hariri to the prime ministry slot, because everyone knows how a prime minister is manufactured in Lebanon," he went on.
"The basic element in this process is a consensus between Syria and the president about the new prime minister. It seems that many are not fully aware of the depth of the strategic relationship that exists between President Emile Lahoud and President Bashar Assad."
On paper, at least, it would seem difficult to deny Mr. Hariri the office. Under the Constitution and the 1989 Taif agreement -- brokered by the United States, Saudi Arabia and Syria to end the bloody sectarian war -- the president must be a Maronite Catholic and his prime minister a Sunni Moslem, to be named after binding talks with Parliament.
In practice, this usually means a number of hopefuls might assemble blocks of supporters, and Syria would weigh in, using its influence over Lebanese politicians to assemble a simple majority for its candidate. In the departing Parliament, Mr. Hariri had only a 14-member bloc and about 10 additional sympathizers.
But the rules are often flexible.
The impasse is the first major problem for Mr. Assad, a mild-mannered 34-year-old eye doctor and computer enthusiast who inherited leadership of Syria, along with the rank of lieutenant general and commander of the army, upon the death in June of his father, Hafez al-Assad, who had run both countries with ruthless skill.
And it is a particularly difficult impasse. Two years ago, the younger Mr. Assad was given responsibility over Lebanon as part of his training to assume leadership.
In his first exercise of power, he selected Mr. Lahoud, a military commander with no political base, to be president. This also, in effect, meant firing Mr. Hariri, who was detested by Mr. Lahoud but was a favorite of the Syrian officials who had been in charge of Lebanon: the longtime vice president, Abdul Halim Khaddam, and a military intelligence chief, Maj. Gen. Ghazi Kanaan.
For a week, the top-ranking Lebanese politicians have been trooping to Damascus to meet with Mr. Assad, as they had so often before been summoned by his father.
But the signals from Syria were far from clear. Some Beirut newspapers have reported that Damascus wanted no further electoral embarrassment to its loyal supporter, President Lahoud.
At the same time, however, the speaker of Parliament, Nabih Berri, leader of the Shiite Muslim Amal movement, who is noted for being acutely responsive to Syrian desires, returned from Damascus, stopping off to see General Kanaan at Syrian intelligence headquarters in the Bekaa region, and promptly announced that his joint Amal-Hezbollah ticket in the south would join in alliance with Mr. Hariri.
Mr. Hariri's forces are contesting 18 of the 19 seats in three districts in Beirut, the main battleground on Sunday, each reserved for a specific religious sect. Mr. Berri's 23 candidates on the Amal-Hezbollah ticket are expected to sweep the south, which was freed in May from more than 20 years of Israeli occupation, and Mr. Hariri should pick up a dozen or so Christian seats in the Bekaa and other places.
While political alliances in Lebanon are often fragile and shifting, sometimes in bloody ways, the current situation represents a major change. Broadly speaking, usually contending religious groups -- the basic political division here -- have been brought into an unusual alliance against the government.
Most notably, Walid Jumblatt, hereditary chieftain of the Druse, an offshoot of Islam, and a major ally of Mr. Hariri, has reached across the old civil war lines to befriend his former enemies on the Christian right.
Among them are former President Amin Gemeyal; Dori Chamoun, survivor of a leading Maronite family in the Chouf mountains with whom Mr. Jumblatt had battled; the supporters of the exiled former army general, Michel Aoun, who fought the last clash with the Syrians; and even the Christian warlord Samir Geagea, who has been jailed on multiple murder charges.
And there are even hints, until now unspeakable, of challenges to Syria's long domination. In a three-hour television interview the other night, Mr. Jumblatt said he was calling for "a correction of the relationship with Syria to be re-established on a balanced basis."

HEADLINE: Reservations With Casinos Gain Ground On Povety

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
The Indian casino boom of the 1990's has helped decrease the historically high rates of poverty and unemployment on Indian reservations, a computer analysis has found.
The review of federal records by The Associated Press found that the explosive growth of the Indian gambling industry -- to $8.26 billion in 1998 from $100 million in 1988 -- has slowed the growth of welfare on reservations and given some tribes hope of reversing decades of poverty. 
 The influx of money has also set off a debate over whether the proceeds should go directly to tribal members or be invested in schools, housing and public works.
"If tribes are making all that money, members are asking, 'When am I going to see some of it?' " said Eddie Brown, who headed the Bureau of Indian Affairs during the Bush administration. "That pressure is beginning to build."
Among the 72 tribes with casinos that use the Agriculture Department's Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, household participation increased by 8.2 percent between 1990 to 1997. But that was far less than the 57.3 percent increase among the 44 tribes without Las Vegas-style casinos.
Similarly, the number of Indian households participating in the food stamp program in states that permit casino gambling increased 5.6 percent between 1990 and 1998. But in states that do not allow casinos, the number of Indian households using food stamps jumped 17.7 percent.
Mr. Brown said that in many cases the slower growth in welfare rolls for tribes with casinos could be traced to direct payments to tribal members from casino profits. The Fort McDowell Mohave-Apache Indian Community near Phoenix, he said, has become "welfare independent." Its 849 members receive up to $30,000 a year each in casino payments.
A total of 48 tribes have obtained approval from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to transfer casino profits directly to members. While the bureau refuses to provide details, payments range up to $900,000 a year for each of the more than 200 members of the Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Sioux Community in Minnesota.
Such direct payments can shrink welfare rolls, but many tribal leaders argue that the best way to attack poverty and unemployment is to invest in education and infrastructure.
At the 20,000-member Gila River Indian Community just south of Phoenix, tribal leaders have used more than $100 million in casino profits for capital improvements.
"We're committed to providing services to the community rather than the individual," said Donald Antone, the new Gila River governor.
Gila River now provides college or vocational-school scholarships to any member who meets academic standards. A $120 million resort hotel and golf course are scheduled to open over the next two years.
The Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe in Minnesota followed a similar route, investing most profits from its two casinos in reservation programs, while paying members $1,500 a year.
But the band's nine-year leader was defeated in a landslide this summer by a candidate promising to abide by a referendum on increasing casino payments to members.
The Mille Lacs Band and the Gila River Community are two of 23 tribes across the country owning casinos that grossed more than $100 million in 1998. Those 23 together accounted for 56 percent of total Indian gambling revenues that year.
For the 80,000 Indians in those 23 tribes, about 5 percent of the Indian population, the effect of casino gambling has been substantial.
Unemployment among those 23 tribes dropped to 27.7 percent in 1997 from 34.5 percent in 1991, according to Bureau of Indian Affairs' records. The average poverty rate in counties that have reservations fell to 14.2 percent in 1995 from 16.7 percent in 1989; the median household income increased by 30 percent, to $31,153 from $23,937.
But tribal leaders say casino profits have just scratched the surface of the economic and social problems confronting their reservations.
On the 582-square-mile Gila River reservation, adobe houses without indoor plumbing or utilities still dot the landscape. Utility service has been provided to 500 new home sites since 1995, but hundreds remain on waiting lists for housing.
"We've been so far behind in everything that the money we're getting is almost like a drop in the bucket," Mr. Antone said.

Russian Refusal Was Vital To Delay on Missile Shield
President Clinton's decision not to authorize even initial construction of a national missile shield had been shaped by events as far back as January, senior administration and Pentagon officials said, when the Russians first made it clear they would not negotiate changes in the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972. 1
 
U.N. Hosts Millennium Summit
The battle over globalization that brought protests to Seattle and Washington moves this week to the United Nations. The three-day Millennium Summit of more than 150 world leaders called to thrash out problems of poverty and peace is turning instead into a debate about the future of the organization, at a time when national boundaries have become nearly as irrelevant to economic and political tides as they are to popular music. 1 

China Protests U.S. Lawsuit
China is demanding that American officials dismiss a civil lawsuit filed Monday in federal district court in Manhattan charging Li Peng, chairman of the National People's Congress, with human rights abuses stemming from the 1989 military crackdown that killed hundreds of student protesters in Tiananmen Square. 4
 
Hostage on Hunger Strike
An American kidnapped by Muslim rebels in the southern Philippines has gone on a hunger strike, the guerrillas said. The Abu Sayyaf rebels had asked that food and medicine be sent to their camp on remote Jolo island for Jeffrey Schilling, 24, of Oakland, Calif. American officials say he is seriously ill and needs regular prescription medicine. (AP)

Candidates Court a Sliver Of Voters: the Undecided
Strategists on both sides agree that more than 90 percent of the electorate has by now settled on either Gov. George W. Bush or Vice President Al Gore. That leaves the outcome in November hinging on a sliver of expected voters -- fewer than 10 percent -- who truly have not made up their minds. 1
 
Al Gore returned to an earlier version of himself, as a writer, during a difficult time: He was turning 40, was deeply in debt and he had just waged a failed campaign for president. In that period he wrote "Earth in the Balance," an environmental call to arms and an examination of his own life. 1
 
The campaign issue of drug pricing is a complex one, involving the economics of advertising, the dynamics of price controls and the budgets of research laboratories. 26 

Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who is not closely tied to President Clinton's failings or achievements, has taken on the job of praising the president in campaign speeches. 26 
 
Vermont Voters at Odds
A backlash is under way among conservative voters in Vermont, a state that has taken liberal stands on issues like property taxes, environmental controls and civil unions for gay couples. Thousands of signs have sprouted on barns and garages and front porches, declaring "Take Back Vermont." 18

Doing the Mambo Not So Easy Anymore
Call it the mambo wars. It could take place on the dance floor of any Latin club -- two people who dance to the same salsa music on different beats. On one hand there are those who dance "on 2," known as New York style mambo; on the other, those who dance "on 1," a majority. Going out to dance did not use to be such a hassle. 1
 
Case Against Troopers Fraying
Two years after two New Jersey state troopers opened fire on three unarmed men on the New Jersey Turnpike, turning racial profiling into a national issue, the criminal case against the troopers is fraying. A series of closed-door decisions by prosecutors and the trial judge during the next several weeks will determine whether the most serious charge, attempted murder, is dropped. 31
 
Cynicism on Education Ideas
No self-respecting candidate for public office -- be it president, congressman or county commissioner -- gets on the stump these days without having something to say about public education. But the people who actually work in the schools or send their children there say they are less than impressed with what they hear. 31

Over the last three decades, State Senator Roy M. Goodman has become a fixture in the politics of Manhattan's East Side and a leader of the moderate wing of the state's Republican Party.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE MEDICARE ISSUE;
No Simple Answers to Rising Cost of Drugs for the Elderly

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
On the campaign stump, Vice President Al Gore pushes his plan for a Medicare prescription drug benefit as a humane effort to help older Americans who are being gouged by profit-hungry pharmaceutical manufacturers. In television commercials, Gov. George W. Bush's campaign characterizes the Gore plan as another example of bureaucracy run amok.
But presidential politics, where sound bites often trump substance, is far simpler than drug pricing, and beneath the candidates' harsh oratory lurk complex questions about the economics of drug advertising, the dynamics of price controls, and the budgets of research laboratories. 
 The answers will affect not only the elderly and taxpayers in general, but also the shape of the prescription drug business, one of the nation's most lucrative industries.
With more sophisticated and expensive medicines being introduced every year, a big question is whether Medicare will be able to afford them. The drug industry's trade group says the plan will inevitably run out of money, resulting in price controls, which could prompt cutbacks in research. But the drug companies typically spend more on advertising than they do on research, leading the vice president to suggest they can well afford a dip in prices.
"Unfortunately, this is not the kind of issue that bumper stickers are made of," said Gail R. Wilensky, who ran the Health Care Financing Administration, the agency that administers the Medicare program, under Mr. Bush's father when he was president. "The good news is we don't pass legislation in campaigns."
Pharmaceutical pricing legislation is fraught with unintended consequences. The last time Congress passed a bill it thought would lower drug prices was in 1990, when it required drug manufacturers to offer their lowest prices to the federal Medicaid program. The result, according to a 1996 study by the Congressional Budget Office, was that the manufacturers simply raised prices for health maintenance organizations. So the government paid less, but private insurers paid more.
With profits that rank consistently higher than other Fortune 500 companies and products that can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year, the drug industry has long been an easy target for politicians. Forty years ago, Estes Kefauver, the Democratic senator from Mr. Gore's home state of Tennessee, held hearings into the pricing practices of drug companies.
Perhaps no issue touches as many lives as the price of medication, which is one reason the issue is dominating the political debate. Another has to do with economics: while prescription drugs account for only 9 percent of all health care spending, they are now the fastest-growing segment of the national health bill.
In 1998, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Americans spent $91 billion on prescription medications; the total is expected to reach $243 billion in 2008. The elderly bear a disproportionate burden: they account for 13 percent of the population but more than a third of all drug spending, and nearly one-third of them lack insurance coverage.
Mr. Gore's plan to ease that burden is nearly identical to President Clinton's. Except for the poorest of the poor, the elderly would not have insurance covering the full cost of all their prescription drugs. Older Americans whose incomes are 135 percent of the poverty level or lower, about $12,000 a year for an individual and $14,000 for couples, would have all of their drug costs covered.
Others would pay premiums on a sliding scale, and would be reimbursed for half the cost of their prescriptions up to $5,000 a year. Once the $5,000 cap has been met, beneficiaries would pay out of pocket, up to an additional $1,500. After that, a catastrophic insurance provision would kick in, and the government would pay all additional drug bills.
The Gore campaign estimates the cost of the proposal at $253 billion over 10 years; an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office estimates the president's plan would cost $297 billion during that time. But the actual cost, Ms. Wilensky said, is extremely difficult to predict.
"Our ability to accurately project prescription drug costs, particularly if you say you are not going to have administered pricing -- that's the polite word for price controls -- is poor," Ms. Wilensky said.
A central feature of the Gore plan is that it offers a uniform benefit; in each region, all Medicare beneficiaries would be covered by the same plan, administered by a single pharmacy benefits manager under contract with Medicare.
That kind of government control worries the pharmaceutical industry. Mr. Gore's plan would effectively give Medicare vast purchasing power, enabling the government to extract deep discounts from drug makers. Medicare drug prices would then become public -- in the private sector, negotiated discounts are kept secret -- and private insurers would inevitably demand similar breaks.
"Medicare is the big gorilla," Prof. Uwe Reinhardt, the Princeton University health care economist, said in an interview last month. But with more people covered by insurance, he argued, the volume of prescriptions would rise, which would offset any decrease in prices.
Like most Republicans, Mr. Bush favors letting the private sector handle prescription drug coverage, an approach that has drawn criticism because many private insurers say they will not offer drug benefits. The Bush campaign has characterized the Gore proposal as a "one-size-fits-all plan" that would interfere with the authority of doctors, presumably by restricting the list of drugs covered by insurance.
In fact, said Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute, a research organization in Washington, such restrictive lists, called formularies, are far more likely to emerge under the Republican approach. That is because the private sector would offer varied plans, giving consumers the opportunity to save money by choosing plans that restricted access.
Under Mr. Gore's plan, Mr. Reischauer said, "The notion that the government will choose your drugs is far from the reality that will evolve."
Mr. Bush will offer a specific prescription drug proposal next week, his campaign says. His aides have said he would incorporate a prescription drug benefit into an overhaul of the Medicare program, building on work of a bipartisan Congressional commission that has called for competition between the public and private sectors. The commission's proposal, which like the Gore plan would have the government absorb prescription drug costs for the very poor, has been introduced as legislation by Senators John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, and Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican.
These two approaches -- a uniform Medicare benefits package versus a range of private sector plans -- reflect deep ideological differences between Democrats and Republicans about the proper role of government. Caught in the middle are the drug makers, who are siding with Mr. Bush. Since last year, according to an analysis by the Campaign Study Group, drug makers have contributed $235,515 to Mr. Bush compared with $50,700 for Mr. Gore.
During his campaign, the vice president has relentlessly attacked the companies as price gougers. But the forces that are driving prescription drug spending are complicated.
The increase, experts say, is not so much because manufacturers are raising prices on existing medicines but because patients are switching to newer medications that cost more. At the same time, more prescriptions are being written, because the population is aging and older people take more drugs.
And there is another possible explanation: advertising, according to Steven Findlay of the National Institute for Healthcare Management Foundation, a nonprofit research group. During campaign stops in Florida and Oregon this week, Mr. Gore has asserted, correctly, that many drug companies spend more on marketing than research. He singled out one of the most widely advertised medications, Claritin, the antihistamine by Schering-Plough.
Mr. Findlay is studying television advertising of prescription medicines, which has flourished since the regulations were relaxed three years ago. "The numbers are quite compelling," he said. "The drugs that are the most heavily advertised to consumers are the ones that are driving the increase in spending," he said.
Those figures raise more questions: Are some people taking costly prescription drugs when cheaper, over-the-counter ones will do? If so, who? And how can they and their doctors be persuaded to use medicines more cost-effectively?
There is scant literature on the topic, said John Golenski, executive director of RxHealth Value, a coalition of consumer, labor, business and insurance groups. "The question of what is appropriate from a medical perspective is more acute than it ever was," Mr. Golenski said, "and that question is not addressed by either party's plan."

HEADLINE: Globalization Tops 3-Day U.N. Agenda For World Leaders

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

 BODY:
The stormy battle over globalization that brought protests to the streets of Seattle and Washington moves this week to the heart of the world's only truly global organization, the United Nations.
An extraordinary, three-day summit meeting of more than 150 world leaders called to thrash out problems of poverty and peace is turning instead into a debate about the future of the organization, as well as the world, at a time when national boundaries have become nearly as irrelevant to economic and political tides as they are to infectious diseases or popular music. 
 The summit meeting, which will begin Wednesday and end Friday, is the pivotal event in a two-week, traffic-stopping extravaganza for New York that began last week with a conference of world religious leaders, an assembly of scores of speakers from nearly all the world's elected parliaments and a meeting of hundreds of nongovernmental organizations from every continent.
A dozen or more other events are planned for the fringes this week, including a "dialogue of civilizations" featuring President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, a "state of the world forum" of government and private sector leaders, numerous street protests and a 10-hour teach-in against a greater role for global business in world affairs.
The United Nations is a more diversified organization than those that have been the focus of recent protests -- the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.
So it is still seen as a hope for solving problems of globalization, rather than as a source of them, and it is not expected to be subjected to the same heated demonstrations that caused so much havoc in Washington and Seattle. Still, the debate over globalization will be intense.
At the United Nations, globalization means many things to many people. It is not simply the greater movement of goods, jobs and capital across borders, but also includes equally important cultural, environmental and political components.
For some countries, most in the industrial world, globalization is an opportunity to expand international standards in law, social development and human rights. For others, many of them developing countries, it holds out the worrying prospect of a United Nations aligning itself ever more closely with new power centers: the big corporations, high technology gurus and cultural icons of the industrialized world.
But unlike other summit meetings, the one here will give the fears and frustrations of the world's smallest and weakest nations equal time alongside the powerful, whose governments and -- increasingly -- corporations are feared for the influence they seem to be gaining inside the organization.
President Clinton, who will give the opening address and stay for three days, will be followed to the podium by the president of Equatorial Guinea. Russia's president will be followed by the leader of the Maldives, who likes to remind others that the big worry for his tiny nation of atolls is that globalization could mean disappearing completely -- if the warming of the world's climate is not halted.
"Globalization is seen by some as a force for social change, that it will help to close the gap between the rich and the poor, the industrialized north and the developing south," said Theo-Ben Gurirab, the foreign minister of Namibia and the General Assembly president for the last year.
"But it also is being seen as a destructive force because it is being driven by the very people, the colonial powers, who launched a global campaign of imperial control of peoples and resources in what we call now the third world. Can we trust them?"
Secretary General Kofi Annan, a Ghanaian with an American education who straddles two worlds, is at the center of the debate.
"Globalization is really defining our era," he said in an interview, explaining why he forged alliances with multinational corporations to improve labor and environmental standards as well as to bridge cyberspace gaps between the industrial and developing worlds.
He also warns political leaders that they have to govern well and learn to take advantage of international opportunities or their fragile economies are doomed. He argues that when citizens of any country are abused, the rulers can no longer tell others to stay out of their affairs.
"It's not that the secretary general is changing things too fast," Mr. Annan said, ranging over topics of relevance to the United Nations as varied as genetically modified foods or intellectual property rights. "The world around us is changing, and we change with it or we will be left behind. We have to adapt to the realities outside."
Mark Malloch Brown, administrator of the United Nations Development Program, said the organization cannot ignore economic changes at a time when government aid has shrunk and international organizations have to look for new sources of money.
"At the end of the day," he said, "everybody has to acknowledge that the primary source of finance for development is going to come out of the private portion of the global and national economy."
Within the United Nations system, some officials are concerned that overtures to giant corporations and multinational industries from the top of the organization will set the stage for problems at lower levels. There are rules of engagement for working with governments, one official said, but there are no guidelines for working with businesses or independent advocacy groups.
Powerful corporations, encouraged by an open door in the secretary general's office, have the means to introduce corrupt arrangements or to pay for special favors among lower-ranking officials, including the handing over of insider information like unpublished research findings, some United Nations employees fear. Such acts would be easier to conceal than overt pressure from governments, which is a constant problem in the organization.
Mr. Annan's "global compact" -- a program intended to enhance cooperation between the United Nations and private corporations on things like labor standards and the environment -- has drawn the strongest criticism from American groups opposed to globalization, among them the Transnational Resource and Action Center in San Francisco.
Its director, Joshua Karliner, said the image of the secretary general standing beside the top executives of companies with bad reputations in the developing world sent the wrong message about the United Nations, and could make it a target of protest. Mr. Karliner's organization is part of the International Forum on Globalization, which is sponsoring the 10-hour teach-in at Town Hall in Manhattan, beginning at 1 p.m on Tuesday.
Debi Barker, deputy director of the forum, said in an interview that the teach-in follows similar events in Seattle and Washington, where the targets were the World Trade Organization, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. "The U.N., unlike the W.T.O., the World Bank and the I.M.F., was really created to be a space to promote peace, human rights, the environment, social justice, livelihoods and democracy," she said. "This is a worthy institution and these are worthy goals.
"We are concerned that things such as the global compact, encroaching its way into the U.N., means that the U.N. is being usurped a bit by corporations and by people who are driving this globalization agenda. We would encourage the U.N. to take the high road; keep to its mandate; separate itself from corporations and deal instead with citizens."
Carol Bellamy, the executive director of Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, said that in the confrontation over globalization there has been an unfortunate tendency to adopt extreme views about business and that these get in the way of exploring new ways of cooperating with the private sector.
Ms. Bellamy, a former American Peace Corps director and New York City politician, has been wrestling recently with critics who want the Children's Fund to break ties with international corporations contributing to the organization. "The world demands a more sophisticated response today," she said.
"An outright rejection of globalization is a head-in-the-sand approach," she said in an interview, adding that the goals of international aid organizations may often coincide, at least in part, with those of business.
"The business community needs peace to see economic growth," she said. "They need kids to be educated to be consumers and workers. The rule of law, good governance, is important for creating an environment that will probably also be good for investment."
Mr. Malloch Brown of the United Nations Development Program says the debate about globalization in richer countries clouds the fact that a significant number of political leaders and nongovernmental organizations in developing nations are not opposed to a more interdependent world economy. They just want to be part of it, and they want it to be more sensitive to the needs of those least able to compete.
Mr. Annan, responding to frustration about the pace and effects of globalization in the developing world, said he had asked the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to work on ways to assist smaller nations in analyzing and simplifying complex economic and trade agreements so that they can benefit.
"It has been said that arguing against globalization is like arguing against the laws of gravity," Mr. Annan told the international conference of nongovernmental organizations last week. "But that does not mean we should accept a law that allows only heavyweights to survive. On the contrary, we must make globalization an engine that lifts people out of hardship and misery, not a force that holds them down."
The United Nations expects all the world's major powers to be represented at the summit meeting, and will make an effort to limit their formal speeches to five minutes each, with unlimited time for more informal talking later.
In addition to President Clinton, President Jiang Zemin of China will attend, as will President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, President Jacques Chirac of France and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
Leaders of most African nations, including Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, will speak. President Abdurrahman Wahid of Indonesia is coming, as are Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat. Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, is also planning to come.
Shadowing the United Nations summit meeting will be the fifth annual State of the World Forum, a private gathering at the New York Hilton of more than 500 prominent figures in finance, labor, science and government. Speakers include Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former Soviet president; Thabo Mbeki, president of South Africa; Gen. Colin L. Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the financier and philanthropist George Soros, and John Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
When the summit meeting ends, there will be commitments to some very ambitious goals, part of an action plan advertised on billboards around New York. World leaders will pledge to halve the number of the world's people who live on less than $1 a day. There are more than a billion of them. Almost an equal number -- many of the same people -- do not have access to clean water.
Their number should also be halved by 2015. By that year, leaders will pledge to have given all children a full primary school education. To show determination in the battle against H.I.V. and AIDS, the leaders will be asked to halt and reverse the spread of the disease by 2015.

Turnaround in Texas: Two Teams Plunge

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
A certain Texas officeholder who is a candidate for office elsewhere has to hope that he will fare better in his race than the state's two major league baseball teams have this year in theirs.
The Texas Rangers and the Houston Astros have had remarkably similar experiences. Winners of three division championships in the past four years but not advancing beyond the first round of the playoffs in any of those years, the Rangers and the Astros both lost key players, voluntarily or involuntarily, last winter and both have spent most of the season in last place. 
 One of the few bright spots for each team has been a player who has broken the franchise's record for hitting in consecutive games. But their season will not be remembered for the feats of Gabe Kapler and Tony Eusebio. The season will be remembered for the great plunge.
"It must have something to do with the drought we're having in Texas," Gerry Hunsicker, the Astros' general manager, said.
"Yeah, it's been a rough year in Texas," said Doug Melvin, the Rangers' general manager, referring to baseball, not weather. "Things just didn't go as planned. I think with both of us it was the cost of having success, the cost of winning divisions."
The Rangers last year had the second highest payroll; only the Yankees paid their players more. They began this season as No. 9, having lowered their payroll from $81.6 million to $70.8 million. The Astros ended last season 11th in payroll ($55 million) and began this season 19th ($51 million).
During the winter, the Rangers traded Juan Gonzalez and lost, not all willingly, Todd Zeile, Aaron Sele, Mark McLemore and Tom Goodwin as free agents. The Astros traded Mike Hampton, Carl Everett and Derek Bell and let Ricky Gutierrez leave as a free agent.
"Winning once you can get by," Melvin said, speaking of the economics of success. "We won three of four; they won three in a row. Your payroll goes sky high. The salaries continue to escalate."
Hunsicker acknowledged that the Astros made moves partly for economic reasons. They also wanted to make room for some younger players they thought were ready, he said.
Addressing the economic part, he said: "We have a budget and we have to live within our means, even moving into a new stadium. A player like Rickey Gutierrez was probably missed more than we anticipated. He's a player we undervalued."
"We didn't strengthen ourselves with the moves we made during the winter," he added. "But I expected the team to contend in our division. A lot of people point to the off-season moves as the beginning of our demise. I don't share those opinions. I think the lineup we put on the field had the potential to be as good as the '98 team, which was the best offensively in the history of the franchise."
The Astros' pitching, Hunsicker said, was a question mark going in. But, he said: "It's been a question mark for this franchise every year. But every year we've had people rise to the occasion and perform above expectations. More and more I think that's what has to happen for clubs to win. Pitching has to exceed expectations."
No one expected the Astros' pitchers to suffer the major shock that accompanied the move from the Astrodome to Enron Field.
"I think the new park has had a greater effect on our club than anticipated," Hunsicker said. "No club can win without a home-field advantage. In the first half it wasn't an advantage for us. We've played much better since then at home. Pitchers are adapting more to the ballpark, realizing that it is realistic to pitch well in this park. You just don't have the margin for error you have in other parks."
The Astros have gone from having one of the most efficient pitching staffs in the league (3.83 earned run average) to having the least efficient (5.33) and from allowing the fewest home runs (128) to being among the leaders in giving up the most (184). The pitchers haven't been helped by the defense, which has already committed more errors (110) than last season (106).
"Our record would be better if we hadn't made any moves in the off-season," Hunsicker said, "but I would be hard pressed to think we'd be in first place or close to first given the breakdowns we've had in key areas."
The Rangers ended last season with eight players who could be free agents.
"We had a chance to be older and more expensive," Melvin said. "For us to keep the players that helped us win the past two years we probably would have had a $95 million payroll with players on long-term contracts. We would have had to stay at 95 for a good two or three years. That's why we felt we had to make some moves."
Trading Gonzalez was the biggest decision the Rangers had to make, but failing to sign Zeile and Sele, the free agents they wanted to retain, hurt the most.
"Sele kept turning me down on $28 million," Melvin said, referring to his four-year offer to the pitcher who subsequently signed with Seattle for two years and $15 million. "I wasn't aggressive on Zeile early on. I didn't go to a third year until the last minute."
As a result of the absent players, Melvin said: "We have not been nearly as good as a team. We took some risks and ended up relying on a lot of ifs. In the past we had been a solid veteran team. We knew what players were going to do for us. This year we went a lot based on potential. It didn't happen. Then we had injuries."
Melvin, in comparing these developments, said: "Last year we won 95 games, had the best year in franchise history and lost 10 to 12 million dollars. This year we have a chance to have the worst record in a long time, and they tell me we can break even."
 
Milestones Are in Reach
Can Darin Erstad break George Sisler's major league record for hits? Can Todd Helton become the first player to hit .400 since Ted Williams in 1941? Can Carlos Delgado become the first Triple Crown winner since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967?
Seldom has there been a season in which three such sterling offensive achievements were within reach in the final four weeks.
Erstad: The Anaheim hit man has 205 hits. With 27 games remaining, he would basically have to average 1.926 hits a game to tie Sisler's record of 257 in 1920, 1.963 to break it. Given the difficulty of registering such averages, Erstad would settle for two hits a game.
Helton: He is hitting .391 after a hitless game yesterday. If, in the Rockies' final 27 games, he averaged 3.62 at-bats a game, his average for his first 133 games this season, he would have to get 44 hits to finish at .40069, or .401. Forty-three hits would take him only to .399 (.39896).
Delgado: The Toronto first baseman is second in the American League in hitting at .362, tied for second in runs batted in with 124 and tied for first in home runs with 39. Nomar Garciaparra of Boston is ahead of him in average at .366, and Erstad is right behind at .361. He is four R.B.I. behind Edgar Martinez of Seattle, tied with Mike Sweeney of Kansas City and just ahead of Frank Thomas of Chicago (122). He is tied in home runs with Thomas and Troy Glaus of Anaheim.
 
One-Hit Wonders
Pedro Martinez, as usual, was so overwhelming in his start against Tampa Bay last Tuesday that his one-hit performance (John Flaherty's leadoff single in the ninth inning) overshadowed performances in other games that night. The Devil Rays were not the only team to get only one hit that night. They were, in fact, only one of three teams that got only one hit that night.
A one-out single by Barry Bonds in the first inning was the only hit San Francisco managed against Pittsburgh (Kris Benson eight innings, Josias Manzanillo one inning). James Mouton's two-run home run in the sixth inning was the lone Milwaukee hit against Los Angeles (Chan Ho Park eight, Mike Fetters one).
The last time one day's schedule produced three games in which teams got no more than one hit, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, was Sept. 24, 1988. Cleveland had one hit against Dave Stieb of Toronto, Texas one hit against Mark Langston of Seattle and Philadelphia no hits against Pascual Perez of Montreal in a rain-shortened five-inning game.
 
Making an Appointment?
Arthur Richman, the senior adviser in the Yankees' media relations department, has a special interest in the outcome of the presidential contest between George W. Bush, former managing partner of the Texas Rangers, and Al Gore.
Richman said he told Bush five years ago that he would someday be president of the United States. After asking him what he was smoking, Richman, a friend of the Bush family, said that Bush told him, "If I become president, I'm going to appoint you my good-will ambassador to the world."
Richman has his passport ready.

HEADLINE: Annual West Indian Parade Set for Alcohol-Free Revelry

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Revelers at the West Indian American Carnival Parade tomorrow will accept, although grudgingly, a ban on alcohol at their festivities, organizers say.
And the New York City Police Department, to enforce the restrictions, will increase its presence there. 
 "We are not happy, but we are going along," said Carlos Lezama, president of the West Indian American Day Carnival Association, "because we are Caribbeanites and Caribbeanites are law-abiding citizens."
The parade, along Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, is one of the most popular ethnic celebrations in New York City, drawing roughly 2 million people each Labor Day. But preparations have been peppered with unpleasantness in recent weeks.
Early last month, the city announced a ban on alcohol sales at all outdoor festivals, including parades, restrictions that have been in effect at the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Manhattan for years. This angered West Indian American Carnival Parade organizers, who said such a ban would cause many of their sponsors to drop out.
Their anger increased when the city backed down somewhat on that ban, saying that the Feast of San Gennaro, an 11-day festival in Little Italy that starts later this month, would be allowed to sell alcohol, although with a reduced number of vendors. It is not yet clear how the city will handle restrictions on alcohol at subsequent festivals.
Parade and community leaders contended that the inconsistency was unfair and strongly hinted that race played a role in the policy decision, a charge Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani firmly denied. The ban on alcohol was largely inspired by the disorder following the National Puerto Rican Day Parade in June, when more than 50 women were sexually attacked.
"I think it is tunnel vision enforcement of what may be a good provision," said Representative Major J. Owens, a Brooklyn Democrat. "The community thinks it is being unfairly treated, but everyone is ready to cooperate. What matters is that the festival be preserved."
In addition to the alcohol ban, myriad other safety-related changes that will probably be less visible to spectators were ordered by the city. Mayor Giuliani ordered some of the changes after two 11-year-olds and an 18-year-old man were killed at the parade last year. The children were hit by a supply van that lurched out of control and pinned them against a sound truck. The man was killed hours later, when he backed away from a snake held by a spectator and was crushed by a truck after a piece of his clothing got caught in one of its wheels.
Parade organizers and city officials agreed to a number of provisions to improve safety. Floats are supposed to be modified to give drivers better visibility, and police officers will be assigned to cars and sound trucks to control spacing between the floats. Everything on wheels will require authorization.
The list goes on: wheel covers are required for trucks and floats, animals like snakes that might frighten spectators will not be permitted, and the number of vendors will be restricted to curtail overcrowding. Spectators will be asked not to dance randomly in the streets or to board floats that are in motion.
Chief of Department Joseph J. Esposito said the police detail would be "adequately increased because there are more things to do now," but declined to give details.
Community leaders said that while the ban on alcohol would not dampen the fun of the parade, which runs along Eastern Parkway from Utica Avenue to Grand Army Plaza, it did make the economics of the event trickier.
"This carnival brings in resources to the city of New York," said Una Clarke, a city councilwoman from Brooklyn. "So it needs more government support, which should subsidize part of the expense so band leaders and costume makers would be able to get the material they need and not spend September doing parties that include the sale of alcohol. And the fact is they have sponsors who also sell alcohol that want to know that there is a return on their investment in promoting it."
Ms. Clarke stopped short of criticizing City Hall. "I am an elected leader in the community and have to display accountability," she said. "I don't have to hit the mayor over his head for everything that is done."
Another point of tension that did not directly involve the city emerged when members of three steel-drum bands planning to compete for prize money during events leading up to the parade were evicted from their practice site late last month.
The landlord of the building housing a warehouse on Parkside Avenue in Brooklyn said the groups had not paid rent to store their equipment and practice there, and the bands have since taken to the streets, where they have also been sleeping, to guard their instruments.

Crime Continues to Decline

BYLINE: By Warren E. Leary

 BODY:
Violent crime in the United States dropped last year to its lowest level since the government began its annual national crime survey 26 years ago. Law enforcement officials credited crime-prevention programs, anti-gun campaigns, more police on the street, tougher sentencing and a healthy economy producing jobs. The rate of violent crime declined 10.4 percent in 1999, the Justice Department said, while crimes against property dropped 8.9 percent. But there still were an estimated 28.8 million violent and property crimes committed last year. Warren E. Leary

Yes! It's Him! (Whaddya Mean, Never Heard of Him?)

BYLINE: By GEORGE F. CUSTEN; George F. Custen, a resident of Park Slope, is director of the film studies program at the City University Graduate Center and author of "20th Century's Fox: Darryl F. Zanuck and the Culture of Hollywood."

 BODY:
Despite their statistical rarity, the famous seem to be everywhere in New York. So residents take it for granted that from time to time, they will come face to face with someone famous.
Naturally, then, in this celebrity-conscious realm, I was not surprised when I recently sighted someone of fame under water. Swimming laps in my neighborhood gym, I saw alongside me Courtney B. Vance, star of John Guare's celebrity-themed play "Six Degrees of Separation." 
 Shortly after, from behind the wheel of my Jeep, I found myself staring into a rather mad pair of eyes, which, I soon realized, belonged to John Turturro. This performance was far more powerful than his tour de force in the film "Barton Fink." In this instance, however, the Method had not motivated Mr. Turturro. Here, the likely cause was that I had nearly run him over.
But wait. I must tell you: these celebrity sightings were not in Manhattan, the spot most people mean when they talk of New York and fame. They were in my neighborhood of Park Slope, Brooklyn. Can it be that my borough is now full of the famous, too?
Alas, no chance. My encounters with Mr. Vance and Mr. Turturro notwithstanding, the fame game in Brooklyn is far, far different than Manhattan's. Here are some of the distinctions.
 
The Lorenz Hart Principle
It is true that the artist Joseph Cornell seemed so attached to Queens that he could rarely bring himself to leave his house (let alone the borough). And it is true that Henry Miller insisted that outside Brooklyn, the rest of the country didn't "exist for me, except as idea, or history or literature." But most people, certainly most famous people, prefer Lorenz Hart's spin: whether born there or not, they would have Manhattan.
In fact, stargazing there is like fishing for trout in a stream that is constantly being restocked. Manhattanites go forth armed with confidence fueled by celebrity options closed off to Brooklynites.
 
The Second-Tier Rule
Still, many famous people at least had the good sense to be born in Brooklyn; you can trample upon their names at the Botanical Garden's Walk of Fame. And many writers present and past, from Paul Auster to Marianne Moore, have chosen to live in or near my neighborhood alone.
But even with such celebrity richness in our midst, Brooklynites are loath to compare their borough's celebrities to Manhattan's. The reason: Brooklyn's leading lights are relatively dim. While Manhattan friends of my teenage years plotted ways to foil hotel security and meet the Rolling Stones, my youthful nights were spent wondering, could the same Beverly Road building in which my Brooklyn aunt and uncle lived also shelter, as was rumored, a being the stature of Shecky Green, the prince of Borscht Belt comedy?
There are exceptions, but a Brooklyn star search is akin to being trapped in a world where many stars resemble the misfit entertainers in the Woody Allen movie "Broadway Danny Rose." Many of Brooklyn's big names are the one-hit wonders, baseball players with career batting averages under .215, people related to someone famous (like Scott Baio's cousin, whose picture gazed down on me from the wall of a Bay Ridge restaurant) and former eminences like Helen Morgan, the star of 20's musicals like "Show Boat," who arrive in Brooklyn when they are sadly down on their luck.
A radical minority go so far as to insist that Brooklyn's specialty is not celebrities at all but their mothers. Their numbers include Mrs. Murphy (Yo! Eddie's mama), Konigsberg (Woody Allen), Streisand, Schrift (Shelley Winters), Moore (Mary Tyler's mom), Marrener (Susan Hayward's mom) and Cansino (Rita Hayworth).
 
Celebrity Drift
After their birth, many celebrities indeed continue to live in Brooklyn; for a time. The trajectory of F. Murray Abraham (the Park Slope Oscar winner who got his statuette playing a jealous composer in "Amadeus") illustrates this rule: truly successful celebrities move to Manhattan. Exceptions to the celebrity-migration law -- Louis Armstrong was a longtime resident of Queens -- do exist. But they are rare.
 
The Deli Connection
Brooklyn is densely populated by a unique celebrity genus: those show-biz pod people whose names and rictus-smiling, toupee-rich, airbrushed photos adorn the walls of many establishments. No one has ever heard of them. Fewer still have ever seen them in the flesh. No one (except, perhaps, Joe Franklin) has ever witnessed one of their performances. Yet, they possess one of celebrityhood's undeniable markers: their head shots, complete with inscriptions, hang near the cash register in every diner, deli or dry cleaner in Kings County.
There is yet another breed of Brooklyn celebrity, as exemplified by my Brooklyn-born great-aunt. She enjoyed a kind of power that came to few souls in any borough. Though not great herself, she was so proximate to greatness that it was hard to distinguish pilot fish from shark. Her aura rested on a single powerful connection. It was rumored, frequently by her, that she and my grandmother Bessie enjoyed triumphant evenings playing cards in the Bronx with no less a figure than "la mamma di Schnozzola." In Brooklyn, this putative link to Mrs. Durante was, for a time, enough to make my once-removed aunt a kind of celebrity, only twice removed.
All these ruminations forced me to face the sad truth: Brooklyn attracts celebrities who are not true celebrities. Manhattan gets nights of a thousand stars; we get the flights of fading stars.
 
"What Is He Doing Here?"
Brooklyn's great virtue may be that indeed, it is a real place whose people stand in admirable relief to the poseurs and mannequins inhabiting some Manhattan neighborhoods. Yet we nevertheless all hold celebrities to a different standard. Whatever our envy-laden carpings, we expect their demeanor, financial status, place of domicile and the sites they frequent to be more glamorous than ours. So, when we see them hopping out of a Manhattan bistro, fine. But when we bump into them in Brooklyn, we feel as if they have violated some modern-day version of the infamous studio-era morals clause in their contracts. We get suspicious. Long accustomed to seeing media representations of Brooklyn in which every citizen is a Ralph Kramden or a character played by William Bendix, the rootedness of such gods in our humble beloved turf makes them seem out of place.
The significance of the Brooklyn celebrity connection was doubly brought home to me by a neighbor who, though he requested anonymity, attained his stature via a continuing role in the HBO hit series "The Sopranos." Recently, several fans spotted him not only in Brooklyn, but in line in the unemployment office. The rapture of recognition quickly turned to suspicion. What, he was asked, would a real star be doing with them, on the unemployment line?
Brooklynites should not conclude they are wanting in the fame department, however. For the greatest concentration of eminent New Yorkers is far removed from Manhattan's bright lights. They have left the city for soothing and peaceful Brooklyn venues: its many fine cemeteries.
Passing through the massive iron gates of Green-Wood Cemetery, which sprawls between Windsor Terrace and Sunset Park, you enter a world of improbable gatherings: Horace Greeley chats with Lola Montez, while Boss Tweed skulks in the background in full view of Samuel F. B. Morse and an entire entombment of piano-manufacturing Steinways.
A short distance to the west, Montgomery Clift has been sighted (again!) in Prospect Park, or rather in the Quaker Cemetery in the park's northeast section. As befitting a deity, this former resident of Manhattan now receives callers beneath a grave designed by the architect of President Kennedy's shrine at Arlington.
In this light, the title of one of Thomas Wolfe's best-known short stories, "Only the Dead Know Brooklyn," is more prescient than that Brooklyn-hater knew.

 The Prince
 Of Tennessee
 The Rise of Al Gore.
 By David Maraniss
 and Ellen Nakashima.
 323 pp. New York:
 Simon & Schuster. $23. 
 Al Gore can balance quite large objects -- tennis rackets, umbrellas, coat hangers, that sort of thing -- on the end of his nose. This unlikely acrobatic skill, perfected when he was a St. Albans schoolboy, tends to find expression when the vice president is bored or keen to defuse a situation, but it is also an apt motif for a life spent juggling rival forces, internal, familial and political. In this fine, deep-mine biography, David Maraniss, an associate editor at The Washington Post, and Ellen Nakashima, a staff reporter there, depict Gore's personality as a remarkable balancing act: parental pressure pulling against personal inclination, the rural son of Tennessee at odds with the cosmopolitan princeling of the Fairfax Hotel, the dreamy idealist and the hard-punching political pro, self-doubt struggling with self-righteousness, "competing characteristics of farsightedness and caution, selflessness and self-aggrandizement, that have defined him, for better and worse, during his political career."
Gore called his 1992 manifesto on environmentalism "Earth in the Balance"; an alternative title for "The Prince of Tennessee" might be "A Life in the Balance." The balance is not always comfortable, and the authors depict a character far more complex and conflicted than the man he would succeed in the White House. Where Maraniss's essential biography of Bill Clinton, "First in His Class," was painted in great swaths of color, this is more a work of pointillism, myriad small dots of reportage brought together to form a vivid portrait.
The shaping of the Gore biography started before his birth. "If I have a baby boy, I don't want the news buried on an inside page," Albert Gore, the father-senator, told the Washington bureau of The Tennessean. "I want it on Page 1, where it belongs."
Gore has spent his entire life on Page 1; he was raised to belong there. When he was 6 his parents were already planting media stories of his precocity, showcasing "another Gore on the way toward the political pinnacle." Perhaps unsurprisingly, given these circumstances, at every critical stage in his life Gore seems to have been aware of an unseen but omnipresent biographer, hovering behind his shoulder, taking notes. "I was a real little politician," he once said, somewhat sadly, of his own childhood. From the earliest years almost every strategic decision, in the authors' phrase, appears to have been underpinned by "thinking politically on a longer arc."
So Gore went to Vietnam, to take part in a war of which he passionately disapproved, because it would make a bad impression and damage his father's already struggling senatorial campaign if he did not. He kept his distance from the tumult of antiwar protest at Harvard, "taking into account not just his feelings at the moment, but also how his actions might affect the political futures of himself or his father." When his father made him work in the Tennessee tobacco fields, was that good farming or just good politics?
There are other, less familiar but equally telling examples of Gore's compulsive self-scrutiny. In 1971, Gore was not attacked by a bear during a camping trip in Yosemite. The Gores had failed to heed warnings and left a half-eaten candy bar in their tent when they fell asleep. Sure enough, a brown bear came into the campsite, clawed the Gore tent and then wandered off again, having signally failed to change the course of history. To anyone else, this might be an opportunity for self-deprecating reminiscence, but not to Gore, who declined to tell the story when urged to, according to a friend, because "he couldn't stand to look bad in front of a group of people." The environmentalist could not be seen to be ignorant on the subject of ursine eating habits.
Someone who senses possible political danger in a half-eaten Snickers dating back three decades is not an easy character to pin down. It is perhaps this restraint, rather than his well-publicized self-inflations and midcampaign image adjustments, that explains why voters still feel they do not know Gore. How well can you know someone so adept at self-projection and protection, whose guard never seems to come down?
Maraniss and Nakashima have come closer to the core Gore than any other biographers to date. They reveal a man of intensely competitive urges, impelled by a Calvinist fear of chaos, plagued by doubts, exceptionally competent and confident but uneasy in his own skin, indefatigable, loyal and loyalty-inspiring yet also somewhat lonely.
There is a scientific literalness in the Gore mentality as described here, an absolute faith in the power of pure information that comes close to obsession. He may not have invented the Internet, but at times Gore speaks and behaves as if the Internet had invented him. "Everything came down to facts -- more than parliamentary skill or emotion or personality or intuition or chemistry or poetry or even wealth, pre-eminent was the raw data that comprised information." There is little of that quality Keats admired, "when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact." A highly trained political animal with an expansive mind and an instinct for the jugular, he yet appears quirkless in his adult life, lacking the edges that give form to character. Although people who know him well consistently vouch for Gore's black and understated sense of humor, there are no memorable examples in this book.
Underneath this often unflattering picture, the authors have identified the contours of an earlier, more attractive portrait, now obscured by successive layers of political veneer: a romantic soul who likes to sing loudly and drive wildly, who profoundly believes there is a right way and wants to find it, a personality so charged and pent up that when he tells his uncertain wife, for the first time, that he is running for political office, he immediately hits the floor and begins doing push-ups. The very rawness of this internal drive inspires admiration, if not necessarily affection.
"Always do right," Gore's father reportedly told his only son as he lay dying. If true, these are strange last words; not a release or a farewell, nor yet an expression of love, but a quotable injunction, another order. You can almost hear the invisible biographer scribbling away. Albert Gore Sr. looms over every page of "The Prince of Tennessee," a white-haired Shakespearean patriarch demanding obedience and dedication, even in death; more insistently in death. The old man's astonishment and anger when his son's first presidential campaign was rocked by the issue of pot smoking is one of the most telling episodes in a deeply formal relationship, fraught with unspoken tension. Plainly it had never occurred to the father that his son could do something that might jeopardize the presidential plan.
For sure, there was little enough devilry in the young scion. Indeed, so heavy is the weight of paternal expectation, of destiny foretold, that at times he almost seems to lack a will of his own, his own instincts obscured by the overriding commandment to "do right." Thus we find his wife, Tipper, as Gore is debating whether to go to Vietnam, pleading with him: "What do you really think and how are you going to feel if you do this?"
"The Prince of Tennessee" achieves what Gore himself has found so difficult on the stump, by rounding him out into a full character, neither the wooden bore depicted by his enemies nor the perfect prince that his father forged and he has always tried to be. Gore's sense of balance has made him a formidable politician: stable, agile, unflappable, a master of policy and a superb debater. But it may also have suppressed some of the humanity within. The prince born to be president was so busy looking ahead to the prize -- amassing all the facts, doing right, projecting the correct image, blending belief and calculation, trimming the message to the audience and circumstance -- that his sense of self somehow got buried. The famously stiff and distant campaigner is also the one who asks insistently: "How'd I do? How'd I do?"
The impression given here is of a man who knows almost everything about almost everything except his own personality. If Al Gore wants to get to know himself better, he would be well advised to read this book.

HEADLINE: All Work and How About Some Play, Too?

BYLINE: By NICOLE ITANO

 BODY:
AT Yarde Metals, an aluminum and steel distributor based in Bristol, children and dogs sometimes go to work and employees can occasionally be found napping on the job.
None of this bothers Craig Yarde, the company's owner and founder, who runs his $115-million-a-year company from a desk in the same large room used by the sales and administrative staff in his central office. He said his company's unusual workplace policies inspire employee loyalty and increase productivity. 
 "The only turnover we have is the turnover that we force," Mr. Yarde said. Mr. Yarde, 48, is a 60's-style idealist. He believes in profit sharing, family-friendly workplaces, and, in a move that garnered a great deal of attention, coed bathrooms.
While most companies around the state will still expect their employees' dogs and children be left at home when they return to work after this Labor Day weekend, an increasing number of Connecticut employers are, like Mr. Yarde, recognizing the role of workplace environment in attracting and retaining quality employees. Many of these companies, particularly those in the technology sector, are taking unusual steps to ensure their employees stay happy, healthy and loyal.
"Companies are having to be more innovative and creative at retaining workers," said Marjorie Bynum, vice president of the Information Technology Association of America. "Salary is important, but it's not the most important thing. Quality of life is really vital as well."
In Connecticut, where unemployment rates are at nearly half the national average, competition for employees is particularly stiff. In a survey of small- and medium-sized business conducted last year by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, more than 80 percent of respondents said they had difficulty finding qualified workers. Forty-eight percent said they had great or extreme difficulty finding qualified employees.
A number of companies, in both the Internet and traditional markets, are responding to the labor shortage by changing workplace rules to make offices more relaxed and fun. Workplace rules have relaxed and increasing numbers of companies are throwing social events during working hours, allowing casual dress and providing on-site facilities such as kitchenettes, gyms and even nap rooms.
"Employers are trying to make the workplace almost home-like because they know that workers spend so much time there," Ms. Bynum said.
According to a study by the United Nations, the number of hours the average American worked over the course of a year increased by almost 100 between 1980 and 1997.
According to a study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, between 1976 and 1993, the number of non-agricultural workers working more than 49 hours a week increased from 13 percent of the work force to almost 20 percent. And that shift is concentrated among professionals.
In the Stamford offices of iSolve.com, an Internet company that helps businesses sell or trade their excess inventory, most Friday afternoons are devoted to an office-sponsored social event such as a cappuccino bar or pretzel and beer party.
Barbara Serf, iSolve's executive vice president of marketing, said the events are important to office morale because with the company's fast growth -- they have hired more than 65 employees since November -- the informal get-togethers are one of the only ways people in the company can meet each other.
"These social events are important so that people get to know each other's names," Ms. Serf said. "In the dot-com world everyone is trying to pay competitive salaries. What everyone really wants is to have fun and enjoy what they're doing."
At Priceline.com in Norwalk, employees are even encouraged to play at work. About a dozen basketball hoops, air hockey and foosball tables scattered throughout the company's three-floor building provide employees a distraction during breaks. The tradition dates to the company's early days when an employee donated a foosball table and it got so much use that when it broke, senior management chipped to buy more tables for the office to share.
"We do that recognizing that there are the longer hours here and that some people need to let off stream," said Brian Ek, a spokesman for the company.
Even companies in more traditional industries are relaxing their work environments. Wilton-based accounting and tax firm Deloitte and Touche, for example, provides kitchenettes and nap rooms for employees.
"It's spawned by the technology companies because intellectual capital is so important to them," said Steve Clement of the Connecticut Technology Council. "It's become more mainstream because the labor market has become more competitive."
A number of scholars, however, have expressed skepticism of new workplace policies designed to make the office more homey. In her book, "The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work," the Berkeley sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild investigated an undisclosed Fortune 500 company to examine the effect of family-friendly polices.
She found that even with these policies, workers were spending more time in the office partly, she argues, because with all the stresses on life at home -- children, marriages, housework -- the new workplace is often the more enjoyable place to be.
Competition for qualified labor has led many companies to offer unusual time-saving and quality of life benefits. Twenty-two percent of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association's survey respondents said they were now offering "creative benefit packages" such as catered meals, laundry and dry cleaning services and online concierge services. Companies said many of these new benefits are designed to help employees balance their work obligations with the rest of their lives.
"In prior years, people tried to artificially separate a person's work life from their work life. In reality, when a person shows up to work, the whole person shows up," said James Wall, the managing director of human resources for Deloitte and Touche, which has 30,000 employees around the country.
One program Deloitte offers helps employees take care of sick family members. The company will help arrange for child care for sick children and even hire temporary help to cook meals or run errands for an employee trying to balance increased home obligations with work.
Mr. Wall said such programs have saved Deloitte millions of dollars by helping the company reduce its turnover rate from 29 to 17 percent in the last eight years.
The demand for services that help employees save time has even led to the development of a whole new high-tech industry: online concerige services. These companies, which generally contract with companies and charge a per-employee fee for basic services, will run errands, make travel and entertainment arrangements.
"We're always looking for benefits that will help our employees," said Peter Cross, director of human resources for Arthur Anderson's Hartford office. His office contracts with Circles, a Boston-based online concierge service. "This is one that's a little different than many. It saves time and helps people get things done that would otherwise be difficult."
Mr. Cross, who also offers his employees free dry cleaning, said his employees use Circles primarily to make travel arrangements and find tickets for events. Jennifer Marino, a spokeswoman for Circles that serves more than one million employees across the country, said the company has even helped plan one customer's wedding.
While benefits such as online concierge services and office luxuries like nap rooms and game tables are still exceptions in Connecticut workplaces, an increasing number of companies are realizing that sometimes it is the little things that keep employees happy and content.
"Those things set you apart as a company that cares," Mr. Clement said.

HEADLINE: Congress's Part in the Firestone Crisis

BYLINE: By Joan Claybrook; Joan Claybrook is president Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy group. She was administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from 1977 to 1981.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As Congress begins hearings this week on the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires, questions will be raised about why the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration didn't take action sooner against Firestone and the Ford Motor Company over tire blowouts and resulting rollovers of Ford Explorers.
One answer is the agency's budget, now more than 30 percent lower in real dollars than it was in 1980. A 50 percent cut during the Reagan administration still hampers the agency's capacity to regulate an ever-growing automobile industry. Congressional interference on behalf of industry in safety recall cases has also shackled the regulators, and they lack needed authority to police automakers. 
 When it is time to drop the enforcement hammer, the safety agency can strike only lightly. The maximum penalty it can impose on Firestone or Ford is $925,000 for refusal to recall products. The penalty for withholding a document is a pitiful $ l,000, no matter how long it is withheld. And there are no federal criminal penalties for these violations, regardless of how many people are killed by a company's reckless behavior. The agency sent legislation to Congress in March to increase penalties, but the proposal for a maximum of $4 million in fines is still far too low to ensure deterrence of large corporations.
The agency's standards for tires and the strength of automobile roofs are 30 years old. Existing tests for roofs are virtually useless in protecting occupants in rollovers.
Over and over, the auto industry has succeeded in stopping strong safety measures like a rollover prevention standard and my proposal for tire inflation indicators on dashboards. Ford and Firestone now argue that consumers helped cause the current problem by not properly inflating Firestone tires.
Would these standards and legislative authority have prevented this disaster? Absolutely. But the agency must also be more proactive: seeking information about defects from repair shops, fleet owners, insurance companies, and lawyers for crash victims; issuing consumer alerts about possible defects and gathering facts from the public; and using its subpoena power to prevent the auto industry from withholding information.
When regulation of automobile safety is hampered or lax, the public pays the ultimate price.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Popular Burmese Leader Tests Wills With Junta" (news article, Aug. 30): Despite the standoff between the Burmese pro-democracy leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and the country's military authorities, your article suggests that there is little that the United States can do to pressure the regime because it has already banned new investment by American firms. 
 Yet a fifth of the export earnings of Myanmar, which was called Burma until it was renamed by the junta, comes from exports to the United States. Those exports, particularly apparel shipments, have been growing. Shouldn't the United States consider barring imports from Myanmar?

HEADLINE: New Economy;
Whose name is it anyway? Arbitration panels favoring trademark holders in disputes over Web names.

BYLINE: By Laurie J. Flynn

 BODY:
IN a little noticed decision in July, the World Intellectual Property Organization forced an American woman, Virginia Comito, to hand over the Internet address www.tonsil.com to Sud-Chemie, a German chemicals company that had held a trademark on the word since 1952. The address was deemed "identical or confusingly similar" to a bleaching product called Tonsil.
A month later, an arbitration panel of the organization ruled that David Sallen, a Boston entrepreneur, would have to turn over the domain name corinthians.com to the Corinthians, a Brazilian soccer team. The panel decided Mr. Sallen, whose site published a handful of biblical quotations, had acted in bad faith, determining that, among other things, he had hoped to profit from selling the name to the Brazilian team. 
 In both cases, the trademark holder prevailed. In the continuing battles between the owners of trademarks and individuals with Internet domain addresses identical to them or nearly so, the trademark owners appear to be far ahead. Of 1,000 cases that have gone before four approved arbitration boards (of which the World Intellectual Property Organization is one), three quarters have been won by trademark owners.
Francis Gurry, the organization's assistant director general, points out that it would only make sense that trademark holders prevail, as only companies that are fairly sure that domain holders are acting in bad faith take their cases to arbitrators.
"The procedure is not for cases where you have some rights and I have some rights," Mr. Gurry said in an interview from his office in Geneva. "These are supposed to be black-and-white cases."
Andrew McLaughlin, president of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the international nonprofit group that administers the domain-name system, which is also known as Icann, defended the arbitration process, which started last December as a way of giving trademark holders an easy way to resolve the growing number of battles over names. He says Icann plans a formal review of the process later this year.
Mr. McLaughlin also pointed out that the statistics on domain name arbitration are skewed because many domain name holders do not even bother to defend their positions.
At the heart of Icann's domain name arbitration system is the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy, a set of rules that provide the litmus tests for determining if a domain name holder is acting in bad faith or is out to hijack a trademarked name. Only trademark holders can take their case to one of the arbitration and mediation centers. The decision of the arbitrators is not binding; companies and individuals can still take the case to court. And in November, the Clinton administration passed the federal Anti-cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, giving trademark holders the right to take speculators to court and to collect damages. But the arbitrators' decisions are enforced by domain-name registrars, who carry them out by transferring domain names, or canceling them.
Of the four arbitration and mediation centers approved by Icann, the World Intellectual Property Organization hears most of the cases, followed by the National Arbitration Forum in Minneapolis; Disputes.org/ eResolutions Consortium in Amherst, Mass., and Montreal; and C.P.R Institute for Dispute Resolutions in New York.
The intellectual property organization has come under scrutiny lately by critics who say it is biased in favor of trademark holders.
James Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, says the organization's decisions de-emphasize free speech in favor of protecting commercial interests. "The ability to call attention to your information is important," Mr. Love said. "To say that big companies can do that and individuals can't is wrong."
Granted, sorting out domain name rights is no easy job. Take the case surrounding corinthians.com, which Mr. Sallen has not taken down despite the ruling. For starters, there is the fact that the Web site operated by Mr. Sallen contains little more than a few biblical quotations and a missive stating "This website is about to be pirated by a huge corporation in Brazil." (Lawyers for the Brazilian team argue the biblical quotations appeared after the complaint was filed, presumably to make it appear the domain name was being actively used when it was not.)
Mr. Sallen had earlier sent the Brazilian team an e-mail offer to sell it the address, raising a red flag for arbitrators.
And, of course, the notion that the organization's litmus test of "confusingly similar" is, well, confusing.
Take the case of Yahoo, which has just successfully argued that several dozen domain names registered by the Data Art Corporation and others, including ayhoo.com, eeeyahoo.com and yafoo.com, are too easily confused with yahoo.com.
A related question arises from the abundance of parody and protest sites, some of which attach a disparaging or crude word onto the trademarked name, as in the case of the London-based electronics chain Dixons and a parody site with a similar and suggestive name. Is anybody really likely to confuse one address with the other? According to the intellectual property organization, they could. The "adoption" of the Dixons name in the address "is inherently likely to lead some people to believe that the complainant is connected with it," the panel wrote in its ruling, which favored the electronics store and forced the parody site to give up the address.
Another case heard by the board was that of the World Wrestling Federation, which argued that a California man was trying to profit from reselling the domain name www.worldwrestlingfederation.com. The federation, which has long maintained a site at www.wwf.com, dating back to when domain names were limited to only 22 characters, took the case to the intellectual property organization, which ruled that the address holder had acted in bad faith, hoping only to profit from reselling the name, and gave the name to the federation.
Still, consumer advocates like Mr. Love argue that the rulings lack balance and create precedents that may have far-reaching effects. The domain name problem, he says, stems from the scarcity of domain names, much of which will be alleviated when Icann next year approves new domain names to supplement .com, .gov, .org and .net.
In the meantime, a rash of celebrity domain name cases should help keep the arbitrators busy. A case brought by the entertainer Madonna against a California pornographer who until last year published a site at www.madonna.com is pending. Madonna, who has her own site at Madonnafanclub.com, is widely expected to win. But the singer Sting, whose real name is Gordon Sumner, lost his battle for the address www.sting.com after arbitrators ruled that the word sting is generic and that Mr. Sumner had not trademarked it.
Of course, when it comes to registering the domain names of famous celebrities, it may take more than arbitration to solve some cases. In May, the organization ordered the operator of a parody site about Julia Roberts to hand over the domain name juliaroberts.com to the actress. But the operator, Russell Boyd, is fighting back and has sued Ms. Roberts. But he confesses on his site that what he really wants is a phone call from her.

HEADLINE: Tiny Tuvalu Profits From Web Name

BYLINE: By JANE BLACK

 BODY:
At the height of the Internet land rush in 1998, an unusual story stood out from the rest: the tiny nation of Tuvalu sold, for $50 million, the rights to its chunk of cyberspace. Tuvalu, a string of islands halfway between Hawaii and Australia with a population of just 10,600, had rarely made world headlines. But the multimillion-dollar sale, to an ambitious Web entrepreneur in Canada, changed all that.
The story really began when Tuvalu, along with dozens of other nations and territories, was assigned its own two-letter suffix that signifies an Internet domain. Under the assignment, Britain received .uk; France, .fr; and Tuvalu, by chance, .tv. 
 Into this picture came Jason Chapnik, a 28-year-old entrepreneur from Toronto. Mr. Chapnik says he came up with the idea of registering names within the .tv domain as early as 1994.
"We started brainstorming," Mr. Chapnik recalled in a telephone interview from his home. "If we could have dot-anything, what would we want? We made lists -- dot-info, dot-law. Once we hit on dot-tv as a concept, we knew we had it."
But getting the rights to the .tv domain from Tuvalu would not be easy. Mr. Chapnik sent written proposals and spent months researching and making contacts with the Tuvalu government. By 1997, other people had come up with the same idea. By 1998, the Tuvalu government had narrowed the prospects down to three companies. So Mr. Chapnik and his wife, Jodi, took a vacation and went to the islands to make their pitch. In the fall of 1998, after months of negotiation, Tuvalu made its decision.
"I think my wife won it for us," Mr. Chapnik said. "Family is very important to them. Coming down with my wife and not business partners spoke volumes to them."
A few months later, Mr. Chapnik secured millions in backing from a leading Internet incubator, Idealab, which provided expertise and the capital needed to pay Tuvalu and build the business.
Under the deal, Tuvalu is to receive the $50 million over the next 12 years. Already, the company has paid the country $18 million. The payments so far have increased the country's gross domestic product by 50 percent and allowed the government to put electricity on the outer islands and create scholarships for its citizens.
Mr. Chapnik had succeeded at turning his idea into a viable Internet business company, dotTV, which is now 50 percent owned by Idealab.
The company's business plan is simple. It wants to be the next Network Solutions. As the wholesaler to the registrars of .com, .net and .org, Network Solutions made millions registering Internet addresses, largely because of the aura of the popular .com domain.
DotTV believes it can have the same kind of success with its domain, which it says is made up of the most recognizable two letters on the planet.
The company, which has its own site at www.tv, registers addresses on its Web site and through third parties like Dotster and GreatDomains.com. Most prices start at $100. Words and letter combinations with higher perceived value, like call letters of a television station, are auctioned off, starting at $1,000. Three names -- free.tv, china.tv and net.tv -- have each sold for $100,000, the company said last month.
The company's most recent success involved the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which agreed to relocate from emmys.org and emmycast.com to emmys.tv. It also sold .tv domains to the Pax broadcast network.
"This is an industry that is exploding," said Craig Francis, dotTV's chief operating officer. "Even at $100 a pop, which is what most names go for," he added, "this has the potential to be very profitable."
Mr. Francis would not say how many names had been sold so far, only that it was in the tens of thousands.
To sell more names, dotTV is trying to make the .tv domain synonymous with "rich" media on the Web, singling out organizations that will use video, audio and interactive features on their sites.
"Right now there is this fundamental shift in the Internet from static text to rich and engaging information that is much more television-like," Mr. Francis said. "We want the .tv domain to tell people that this is what a site is doing."
But achieving .com-like status for the new domain could still prove a challenge.
Clay Shirky, a partner at Accelerator Group, a consulting firm that works with Web start-ups, says the company's plan is based on the scarcity of commercially available domain names -- a scarcity that he says is not going to last.
"It is true that most of the 'good' .com names have been taken," Mr. Shirky said. "But the crash of the Internet market has cooled people's desire to pay buckets of cash for an easy-to-remember domain name."
Adding to dotTV's hurdles, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the international group charged with administering the domain-name system, plans to release a set of new domains, which might include suffixes like .web, .store and .sex, early next year.
So far, the only clear winner is Tuvalu. With some of the money it earned in the dotTV deal, it has financed the process to join the United Nations. Tomorrow at the United Nations, the organization will have a flag-raising ceremony for Tuvalu.
Koloa Talake, chairman of the nation's public sector reform program and a member of the board of dotTV, is quick to see a connection.
"The world's recognition of Tuvalu as an independent country has been made possible by the relationship with dotTV," he said, adding that the company was helping Tuvalu "get into the 21st century."

WorldCom in Talks to Buy Communications Concern
WorldCom is in advanced talks to acquire Intermedia Communications, a telecommunications operator in Tampa, Fla., for almost $3 billion in cash and stock, executives close to the negotiations said.
Intermedia has been an attractive takeover target because it has a 54 percent stake in Digex, which provides Web-hosting services for corporate sites. WorldCom entered negotiations with Intermedia after talks between Intermedia and Global Crossing broke down. A third suitor, Exodus Communications, offered to acquire Digex directly but was rebuffed by Intermedia. Page C2. 

Trademarks Winning Domain Fights
In the continuing battles between the owners of trademarks and individuals with Internet domain addresses identical to them or nearly so, the trademark owners appear to be way ahead. Of 1,000 cases that have gone before four approved arbitration boards, three quarters have been won by the trademark owners. New Economy. C3.
 
A Tiny Nation Profits From the Web
As the wholesaler to the registrars of .com, .net and .org, Network Solutions made millions registering Internet addresses, largely because of the popular .com domain. Now a company called dotTV believes it can have the same kind of success with its domain, .tv, which it says are the most recognizable two letters on the planet. But to get the name it had to pay $50 million to the nation that owned it: Tuvalu, a string of islands halfway between Hawaii and Australia. C2.
 
Sports Sites Revamp Sales Strategy
Sports Web sites cheer the coming of autumn as fans increasingly flock to their computers to trade gossip, scores and injury reports on football, basketball and hockey. A year ago, many of those sites also promoted new online stores. Twelve months later, these "sports content" sites are putting as much distance as they can between themselves and their e-commerce experiments. They are not eschewing e-commerce altogether. Rather, many of them are taking a new approach to selling goods online, placing the site's store in the hands of an outside company. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. C5.
 
MP3.com Disputes Copyrights
In the copyright-violation case involving Universal Music Group and MP3.com, which created a database of compact discs to allow users to listen to music from their collections on the Internet, a federal judge is set to rule this week on whether MP3.com willfully broke the law or started the service in good faith. That ruling will help determine damages. But MP3.com's lawyers now dispute the validity of Universal's copyrights because the company designated them "works for hire," a concept that they argue has no legal basis. C7.
 
Builder Seeks Debt Relief in Japan
A large Japanese construction company, Kumagai Gumi, is expected to ask its creditors to forgive $4.25 billion in debt. The company joins a number of debt-burdened businesses, many of them construction companies, that have asked for relief from their creditors. C4.
 
Station Goes From On-Air to Online
Last Monday, a radio station in California became the first United States broadcaster to depart the FM dial and continue on the Internet without an interruption in programming. The new Web-only entity is an experiment by its parent company, Clear Channel Communications, which sold the station's two frequencies, along with 83 others, to allay Justice Department concerns about its recently completed $23.8 billion purchase of AMFM.

Chicago Markets Call Off Talks
A proposed merger of two financial powerhouses fell through late last week as the Chicago Board Options Exchange called off talks with the Chicago Board of Trade. The combination had been proposed as a way for the two exchanges, which have been fighting over trading rights, to retain their dominant positions in the face of increasing electronic competition.

Some Unexplored Options For a Missile Defense
The debate about a national missile defense system has obscured the potential candidacy of a lesser-known antimissile weapon known as the theater missile defense system, designed to protect American troops and bases in relatively small regions. Theater missile defense systems potentially could be expanded to protect larger areas and perhaps even the entire United States, analysts inside and outside the military say. A1
 
Strong Challenger in Yugoslavia
In the race for president, polls suggest that the moderate nationalist Vojislav Kostunica, the most serious opposition candidate ever to challenge Slobodan Milosevic, ought to be able to win. The election is being closely watched by the United States and NATO, which bombed Yugoslavia for 78 days last year over Kosovo and have labored since to push Mr. Milosevic out of office. A1 

U.S. Voice for U.N. Support
With President Clinton preparing to visit New York this week for a meeting of world leaders at the United Nations, the American ambassador, Richard C. Holbrooke, said that the United States must focus more on its relations with the organization, which he called "indispensable" to American foreign policy. A6

Japan Displays Its Troops
More than 7,000 uniformed soldiers participated in an earthquake preparedness drill in central Tokyo. Critics called it a public relations operation for the military, saying that many politicians would choose to revise the Constitution to allow Japan to field a full-fledged army for the first time since its defeat in 1945.

Bush Offers Debate Dates And Tries to Turn Tables
Trying to end questions about his willingness to debate and turn the tables on his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush announced a schedule of three hand-picked debates that he wanted to do, only one of which is guaranteed to be broadcast on the three major networks. Mr. Bush pointedly challenged Vice President Al Gore to meet him on these chosen dates and terms. His idea drew an immediate reaction from Mr. Gore, who said he was "very disappointed." A1
 
Vice President Al Gore begins the fall stretch of the presidential campaign buoyant in the polls and brimming with confidence. But the Gore team's newfound euphoria is tempered with caution. A14
 
Mr. Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman kicked off a round-the-clock Labor Day campaign swing designed to portray them as the ticket for the working class. A14
 
More Immigrants in Work Force
The percentage of immigrant workers in the nation's labor force has climbed to its highest level in seven decades. This influx -- immigrants now represent 12 percent of the nation's workers -- is having profound effects on the work force and the economy, helping hold down wages in unskilled jobs and giving many companies the employees needed to expand. Immigration analysts estimate that nearly 5 million of these workers are illegal immigrants. A1
 
What War-Ready Means
The 49th Armored Division of the Texas National Guard -- nominally under Gov. George W. Bush's command -- has the lowest ranking for wartime readiness that the Pentagon gives, according to military officials. It has been that way for the last three years. But just as the Pentagon disputes that its active-duty forces are not ready for combat, the 49th Guard division's case reveals a far more difficult question about the overall state of the American military today. It involves an arcane, sometimes subjective readiness accounting system that can be misleading and is not easily reduced to the sound bites of a presidential campaign. A15

Working Harder, Longer

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
There's a lot of good news to report this Labor Day. Unemployment is very low and wages are rising. The benefits of the booming economy are being widely distributed. Workers at the bottom are finally enjoying significant increases in their inflation-adjusted wages. Better yet, the U.S. is experiencing a surge in the growth of labor productivity which, as noted in a book-length report from the Economic Policy Institute, is "probably the best indicator of an economy's capacity to provide for the material needs of its population."
This good news is the result of the rapid economic growth and most especially the sustained low unemployment that really got rolling in the mid-1990's. The key issue has always been the same for working people -- jobs, jobs, jobs. 
 "Employment opportunities have expanded considerably, especially for historically disadvantaged groups, including women, blacks and Hispanics," the report said. "The long-term rise in job instability and job insecurity, which continued well into the current economic recovery, finally appeared to have abated at the end of the last decade.
"Even the share of workers in nonstandard -- often substandard -- work arrangements, such as temporary work and part-time work, has declined as opportunities for regular full-time employment have grown."
Nirvana, yes?
Well, no.
For one thing, there's the time crunch. Families with children have had to work harder and harder over the past few decades to maintain a decent standard of living, and that phenomenon continues. The number of earners per family has increased, as have the average number of weeks worked per year, and the number of hours worked per week.
That doesn't leave a lot of quality time for families to enjoy the benefits of their added income. As a woman in New Jersey recently said: "We're a working family all right. That's all we do is work."
And then there's the matter of indebtedness. The institute's report, which is titled "The State of Working America 2000-01" and is published by Cornell University Press, makes it clear that despite the rosy stock market stories of the past few years, the typical American family accumulated more debt in the 1990's than it made from the appreciation of stocks.
The authors wrote:
"The total wealth of the typical American household improved only marginally during the 1990's. The net worth of the typical household rose about $2,200 in the 1990's -- from $58,800 in 1989 to $61,000 in 1998. While this household's assets grew modestly -- stock assets were up by $5,500 and nonstock assets by $8,500 -- its debt rose as well, by $11,800. Thus, the relatively modest gains in stock and nonstock assets combined with the offsetting rise in household debt meant that the 1990's were far less generous to typical households than business-page headlines often suggest."
"Middle-income families are ahead of where they were four or five years ago to the tune of two or three or four thousand dollars, and that's not chicken feed," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist and one of the authors of the report. "But they are more indebted, working more and more hours, and the stock market boom has largely passed them by."
The times may be terrific, but American working families are not well-prepared for significant downside economic surprises. "On some level," said Mr. Bernstein, "their future is largely dependent on staying where we are with regard to unemployment and productivity."
Meanwhile, the public profile of the poor has diminished almost to the point of invisibility. But they are still there. Despite the economic gains of the past few years, the national poverty rate in 1998 -- the latest year for which complete statistical data was available -- was 12.7 percent, just one tenth of a percentage point less than in 1989, and one full percentage point higher than in 1979.
Nearly one in five American children lives in poverty.
The tight labor market is helping, and poor families are working more. But the progress is painfully slow.
Historians will look back at Labor Day 2000 and marvel at how well America was doing. And then they will assess how wisely, during these best of times, we invested our considerable resources in the unfinished business of creating a brighter future for everyone.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN WORKERS AT HIGHEST LEVEL IN SEVEN DECADES

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
As employers clamor for more foreign-born workers and as tens of thousands of Mexicans slip across the border each year, the percentage of immigrant workers in the nation's labor force has climbed to its highest level in seven decades.
New figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the number of immigrant workers jumped to 15.7 million last year, up 17 percent from three years earlier. Immigration analysts estimate that nearly 5 million of these workers are illegal immigrants. 
 This influx -- immigrants now represent 12 percent of the nation's workers -- is having profound effects on the work force and the economy, helping hold down wages in unskilled jobs and giving many companies the employees needed to expand.
Immigrants dominate dozens of jobs, especially arduous, low-paying ones: poultry plant workers, meatpackers, gardeners, hotel maids, seamstresses, restaurant workers, building demolition workers and fruit and vegetable pickers.
"Immigrants are now a critical part of the labor force across the board," said Demetrios Papademetriou, co-director of international migration policy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "We are into a new world of immigrants basically spreading throughout the economy. This is something that is going to continue and intensify."
With the unemployment rate at 4.1 percent, near its lowest point in 40 years, the debate about immigrant workers has shifted considerably from five years ago, when many politicians called for more restrictive policies.
Now, software companies, farmers, hotels and other employers desperate for workers are pressuring Congress to enact legislation that would admit hundreds of thousands of additional immigrants each year.
But some groups, most notably labor unions and engineers' associations, are fighting such an easing, fearing that it would depress wages and cost jobs for American workers. At the same time, unions have softened their once hard line toward illegal immigrants already in the country, as they seek to unionize them.
Economists and demographers see a continuing surge in immigrant workers unless there is a major economic downturn. Under existing quotas, about 800,000 immigrants enter the nation legally each year. An estimated 300,000 enter illegally.
These workers range from supermarket delivery people who have received an illegally low $3 an hour, far less than the $5.15 an hour minimum wage, to $100,000-a-year software developers from India.
As the number of immigrant workers has soared, Americans are voicing less anger and anxiety about immigration than in the mid-1990's. The reason, political analysts said, is that the expanding economy and low jobless rate have reduced economic insecurity.
Not only that, politicians who led the attack against immigrants -- with measures to cut government benefits to the children of illegal immigrants -- have seen their efforts backfire, especially in California. There, the fast-growing Hispanic and Asian populations have moved to punish anti-immigrant politicians in the voting booth.
"You have a very robust economy and full employment, and that always changes the terms of debate on immigration," said James P. Smith, an economist with the Rand Corporation who was chairman of a 1997 National Academy of Sciences study on the effects of immigration. "When there are plenty of jobs around, the finger pointing that goes on about immigration goes away."
Even so, in some places, like Farmingville, N.Y., residents have complained that dozens of immigrant day laborers who assemble in streets and parking lots each morning to be picked up by employers are an unsightly horde who litter, commit crimes and hurt property values.
At the same time, many Americans have found that the stream of immigrants has provided them with affordable gardeners, nannies, housekeepers -- even manicurists
"Americans rely very much on low-cost immigrant labor to maintain their living standards, which means everything from lawn care to inexpensive agricultural production to the construction business," Mr. Papademetriou said.
One unhappy result of the influx of immigrants has been a wave of violations of the nation's labor laws. Unscrupulous employers have refused to provide workers' compensation or pay minimum wage or time-and-a-half overtime to immigrants required to work 70 to 80 hours a week. Some female immigrants have complained that their bosses sexually harass them, and they fear that if they complain, their bosses will report them to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
One immigrant, Silverio Otero, a grocery store worker on New York's Lower East Side, complained that for a long time he was paid $240 a week even though the store owner required him to work 72 hours a week. That came to $3.33 an hour.
"They didn't treat us very nice," said Mr. Otero, a 29-year-old native of Mexico who will receive $7,000 in back wages because of a settlement arranged by Eliot L. Spitzer, the New York State attorney general. "They took advantage of us because we were immigrants and they didn't think we would speak up."
Officials from a coalition of industries pushing Congress to grant several hundred thousand more temporary worker visas each year said they were not looking for easy-to-exploit workers, but simply for workers. Among the groups pressing for such legislation are the National Restaurant Association and the American Hotel and Motel Association.
"We want to make it easier for employers who are facing shortages to hire foreign workers," said John F. Gay, co-chairman of the industry group, the Essential Worker Immigration Coalition. "We've tried everything we could think of to bring more American workers into the labor force, but with this booming economy, it hasn't been enough. It's not a question of finding cheaper bodies. It's a question of finding bodies."
Other industries are making similar pleas. The agricultural industry wants Congress to allow in more foreigners to plant and pick produce. Computer and software companies have asked that more three-year visas be granted each year to foreigners with technology expertise. In 1998, Congress expanded that program to allow in 115,000 workers, up from 65,000, and now the high-technology industry wants that quota lifted to more than 200,000.
Many labor groups, including the United Farm Workers and the A.F.L.-C.I.O., are fighting these proposals. The unions argue that workers brought in under such programs drive down wages and essentially are easy-to-exploit captives restricted to working for one company.
The Clinton administration, mindful of Silicon Valley's political contributions and organized labor's political muscle, has signaled that it favors increasing the number of high-technology visas, but not those for unskilled workers.
"In high technology, we are now trying to meet a real spot shortage," Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman said. "But when you talk about jobs in the hotel industry and other areas, there's still a lot of untapped employment potential in the nation, and I believe that we can meet those demands with Americans."
This debate is influenced heavily by the way immigration creates different winners and losers.
American businesses, ranging from motels and lettuce farms to corporate giants like Intel and Apple, benefit from the influx of immigrants. But the National Academy of Sciences study found that immigrants, especially illegal, unskilled workers from Mexico and the rest of Latin America, have pushed down wages for American-born workers with less than a high school education by 5 percent.
That study found that immigration increased the nation's economy by $10 billion -- a tiny amount in a country with a gross domestic product of nearly $10 trillion.
"The real impact of immigration is not to increase the size of the pie, but to redistribute the pie," said George J. Borjas, a Harvard University professor of public policy. "If you happen to have the type of job that competes with immigrants, you're often hurt, but if you're a company or an upper-middle-class person who hires immigrants, then you benefit."
In recent months, one of the biggest changes has been the softening stance of labor unions toward illegal immigrants. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has called for repealing the law that bars employers from hiring illegal immigrants -- a law organized labor lobbied successfully for in 1986.
While still favoring strict limits on the number of immigrants entering the country, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has reversed itself by calling for the granting of legal status to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants. Giving them legal status, union officials said, would make it harder for employers to exploit them and hold down their wages.
"There was a recognition of how immigrants are being discriminated against and of the indignities they suffer," John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said. "We saw that the present immigration policies weren't working and that it was time to call for a fairer policy that treats these people in a more humane way."
As part of this shift, many unions that once sought to keep immigrants out of their fields now are eager to organize those workers.

HEADLINE: The Gateway City

 BODY:
New York City has long held a special place in American life as a metropolis that perpetually renews itself with waves of foreign immigration. That has never been truer than today, when the city is brimming with newly arrived residents. At the end of a decade in which one million newcomers swept into the city, 40 percent of New Yorkers are now foreign-born, the highest level since 1910. The city is enriched by the immigrants, but it also faces major challenges in helping to integrate them fully into the life and economy of the city.
The earlier generations of immigrants who passed through Ellis Island were largely from Europe. The fastest-growing groups these days are from South Asia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and the nations born of the breakup of the Soviet Union. In Queens alone 167 nationalities and 116 languages coexist. That variety is one of New York's most distinctive traits. While other cities tend to attract immigrants primarily from one or two foreign regions, New York is a magnet for the whole world. The immigrants come because of the city's reputation as a point of entry and the presence of friends and relatives. 
 If it were not for immigration, the city's population would be decreasing today. The newcomers culturally and economically revitalize abandoned neighborhoods, and their presence bolsters the economy and contributes to the tax base. But the surge has also brought a slew of challenges. Many immigrants do not speak English, and long lines of people are turned away from the too-few English classes sponsored by nonprofit organizations and community colleges. The inability to speak English keeps immigrants in very low-paying jobs. Many Mexican and Dominican immigrants, for instance, earn less than $20,000 a year.
Meanwhile, a shortage of affordably priced housing has led to overcrowding in poor areas. It is not uncommon in some Bronx neighborhoods for four or more people to live in a single room. Schools are also inadequate in these neighborhoods, with enrollments straining already sparse resources.
Because newly arrived immigrants are not eligible to vote -- and turnout is low among those who have become citizens -- many of these problems do not receive the attention they deserve from political leaders. Naturalized citizens should be encouraged to register to vote, and local politicians need to make more effort to reach out to these traditionally ignored populations. In addition, immigrants are often unaware of the programs that do exist to help them. Public housing aid and child health insurance, for example, are not widely used by immigrants who are eligible for them. Many immigrants use emergency medical care but also rely on unlicensed community clinics, in part because they are unaware of the dangers associated with such clinics.
Poverty rates among immigrant populations are high, and if current problems are allowed to grow, they could lead to a permanent underclass of immigrants. With the city's foreign-born population expected to grow even larger in the years ahead, the health of the city will depend in no small measure on how successfully it absorbs its newest residents.

HEADLINE: Mob's Shadow Still Falls Across Building Projects

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
Several months ago, the city suspended more than $80 million in contracts with a construction company that has a key role in closing the Fresh Kills landfill so that officials could investigate allegations that the company had ties to organized crime.
The city's action against the company, Interstate Industrial Corporation, which has also done work on the city's new $71 million stadium complex on Staten Island, attracted little attention. Yet it was hardly an isolated case. Last year, for example, two successive companies hired by the city to supply concrete for the renovation of City Hall Park were thrown off the job in two months because of similar suspicions. And during construction of his high-rise apartment complex on Manhattan's West Side in 1997, Donald J. Trump faced problems because one contractor -- who was indicted in 1987 in a mob-related bribery case -- provided substandard concrete that had to be replaced. Another company on the job was owned by a man whom the F.B.I. had long identified as a mob associate. 
 Despite state and federal racketeering cases over the last two decades that broke organized crime's monopoly in the construction business in the New York area, the mob has remained entrenched in the business, feeding off public works projects and private developments, law enforcement officials and industry experts say.
"There are still many industries, including the construction industry, that suffer from its insidious influence," said the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, who has investigated construction industry corruption since the 1980's. "The effect of the mob's continued involvement in these industries is to impose a mob tax, which raises prices and makes New York City a less attractive place to do business."
In the case of Interstate, a Sanitation Department spokesman said the investigation would have no effect on the scheduled closing of the landfill in December. But industry experts said rebidding the work could add tens of millions of dollars to the $500 million cost of closing Fresh Kills.
In March, the city halted work on $31 million in Department of Sanitation contracts with Interstate, which is based in Clifton, N.J. At least $30 million more in work that had been awarded to the company but not yet started was also suspended, city officials said. The company was hired to cap portions of the landfill and provide dirt for Fresh Kills. The city also suspended a $24 million contract with the company for road construction in Brooklyn.
Through its lawyer, Harold J. Ruvoldt Jr., Interstate adamantly denied that the company or its owners, Frank and Peter DiTommaso, had ties to organized crime. The DiTommasos are brothers. Mr. Ruvoldt said Interstate was cooperating with the city and expected to be cleared -- with the contracts reinstated.
Prosecutors and investigators said it was impossible to precisely gauge the extent of organized crime's continued role in the construction industry, given the shadowy nature of its influence. Christopher Prather, who oversees the organized-crime task force for State Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, said corrupt labor unions or individual union officials were still central to organized crime's ability to make money in construction, a $29 billion industry that accounts for more than 7 percent of New York City's economy.
Common schemes generally involve bribing union officials so that a company can hire cheaper nonunion workers and forgo expensive payments into pension, benefit and health and welfare funds. The schemes violate prevailing-wage laws, which require contractors on public works projects and in some cases large private projects to pay workers a set wage.
"There are bound to be a few takers" when a contractor can drastically reduce his payroll costs through bribery, Mr. Prather said. "Once you get a few takers, it puts pressure on an industry. Pretty soon, people who want to play by the rules finally can't compete and it becomes a race to the bottom as far as who is going to cheat the most."
Violations of the prevailing-wage laws are at the heart of an extensive labor-racketeering indictment expected to be unsealed in Manhattan soon that names about three dozen union officials, contractors and reputed mobsters, according to an investigator.
The indictment is based on a long investigation by Mr. Morgenthau's office and the New York Police Department's Organized Crime Investigative Division. It involves three different mob families in construction projects around the city, said the investigator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Among those charged in the case will be Steven Crea, 53, the acting boss of the Lucchese crime family, who the authorities have said played a direct role in many of the family's construction rackets, and two of his senior aides, Dominick Truscello, 66, and Joseph Tangorra, 51, who is known as Joey Flowers. Police detectives have dubbed the case Operation Textbook because they see it as a primer on labor racketeering.
The indictment outlines organized crime's involvement in the construction of city schools in the Bronx and Queens and in projects built for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the city's Department of Transportation, the investigator said. In addition to the role of the Lucchese group, one of New York's five Mafia families, the indictment implicates associates of the DeCavalcante family, a smaller mob group based in New Jersey, and the Bonanno crime family.
A lawyer for Mr. Tangorra, who is already under indictment in Brooklyn on federal extortion charges, said yesterday that his client had never been convicted of a crime and denied that he had any times to organized crime.
Robert Leighton, who represents Mr. Truscello, would not discuss the pending charges, and Mr. Crea's lawyer could not be reached yesterday.
Prosecutors and industry analysts said that although it was difficult to estimate the cost of mob infiltration of the construction business, the price could be measured in some tangible ways. They pointed to the reduced number of school seats available in neighborhoods where organized-crime figures have hijacked school construction projects and the effect that higher building costs can have on the construction of public and low-cost housing.
In 1990, the city set up its Vendex database to screen contractors and suppliers in an effort to weed out those with histories of poor performance, corruption or ties to organized crime. But in many cases, such problem companies slip through. In the case of Interstate, there was nothing in the database that would have raised any flags.
Interstate's problems began in October 1996, when the company bought a transfer station for dirt and construction debris, Metropolitan Stone Corporation, which government documents say was owned by one reputed member of the Gambino crime family and controlled by another, Edward Garafola, 62, a larger-than-life figure in the construction industry for more than two decades. Mr. Garafola is married to the sister of Salvatore Gravano, the Mafia turncoat known as Sammy the Bull, whose testimony sent John J. Gotti to prison for life. Prosecutors say Mr. Garafola took over many of Mr. Gravano's construction rackets when Mr. Gravano became a government witness.
After the purchase, the city's Trade Waste Commission began reviewing Interstate's license application for the transfer station and subsequently opened a criminal investigation with federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, investigators said.
Meanwhile, the authorities in New Jersey, who had been reviewing the company's application for a license to do construction work at casinos in Atlantic City, issued a report raising questions about possible ties to organized crime.
Although the report did not recommend denying the license, it called for a hearing to explore its concerns. Three days later, an official with Interstate, Lawrence Ray, 40, was indicted on stock fraud charges by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn after an unrelated investigation. Mr. Garafola was charged with extortion as a result of the same investigation.
The pressure intensified, and within weeks, the city suspended its contracts with Interstate. Mr. Ruvoldt contended that Interstate was being unfairly singled out, saying it was helping the city clean up the transfer station by buying Metropolitan Stone. "The DiTommasos are getting tarred because they came to the table as good guys and bought out a transfer station, helping the city accomplish its goal, and this is simply unfair," he said.
A spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Sunny Mindel, said, "At this point, these are allegations which are being investigated, and final decisions will be made upon completion of the investigation."
Since the early 1990's, Interstate has done hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of work in major private and public projects, including concrete work on the stadium complex in Staten Island. Michael G. Carey, the president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said Interstate had nearly completed $7 million in work at the complex. Mr. Carey said that at the time the company was selected, there was no reason to question its fitness.
The DiTommaso brothers are the sons of a New York City police officer, Anthony DiTomasso, who in the 1950's started L&T Contracting with his brother, a city firefighter, according to documents the brothers filed with the city. Among the jobs that Interstate has completed, the documents said, are the control tower at Kennedy Airport, the new federal office building in Lower Manhattan and the Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Courthouse in Newark.
Like the city, New York State has spent millions on construction projects that have involved companies with ties to organized crime. In one case, Worth Construction Company was awarded a $20 million state contract to help build a hospital wing at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, a state prison for women in Westchester County. The company, which also did $14.4 million in work at the Triborough Bridge for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, is owned by Joseph Pontoriero, 60, who law enforcement authorities contend is tied to the Genovese crime family.
Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for the State Division of Criminal Justice Services, would not discuss how the contract was awarded to Worth.
Mr. Pontoriero was listed as an unindicted co-conspirator in the so-called commission case, a key prosecution in 1986 that helped break the mob's stranglehold on the concrete industry. That trial, a 10-week glimpse at gangland lore, established the existence of a Mafia politburo, known as the commission, and resulted in the conviction of the city's top crime leaders.
He was a regular visitor to the Palma Boys Social Club in East Harlem in the 1980's, where, according to the F.B.I., he often met and talked with Anthony Salerno, then the crime family's boss.
In 1998, Worth, based in Bethel, Conn., was disqualified by the New York City School Construction Authority's inspector general from bidding on city school jobs because the company refused to answer questions about accusations that Mr. Pontoriero and his company were controlled by organized crime. The company did not return telephone calls seeking comment, but in the past it has denied any links to organized crime.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE DEMOCRATS;
Gore and Lieberman, Framing Themselves as Working-Class Heroes, Rally Round the Clock

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., Sept. 3

 BODY:
Like college students pulling an all-nighter together, Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman today kicked off a round-the-clock Labor Day campaign swing designed to portray them as the ticket for the working class.
On the holiday weekend traditionally seen as the start of the stretch run to the November election, Mr. Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, continued the populist themes on which he has based his general election run. 
 "The key difference in this election is we're for the people, they're for the powerful," he told 100 cheering construction workers in the unfinished Hyatt Regency hotel in downtown Philadelphia.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman set a grueling schedule from this afternoon through Monday night.
Dubbed "Al and Joe's Hard Day's Night Tour" by the campaign, it aimed to cram as many appearances in as many swing-state media markets as possible into a little more than 24 hours.
They flew here together from Philadelphia for a rally at the airport and a late-night meeting with hospital workers at Hurley Medical Center. From here they were to fly to Tampa, Fla., where they planned a predawn visit to an all-night diner, followed by breakfast with firefighters and a rally at a firehouse.
From there, they planned to double back to the North.
Mr. Gore was scheduled to join a Labor Day celebration in Pittsburgh, and end his day with another Labor Day event in Louisville, Ky.
Mr. Lieberman was booked to fly from Tampa to Detroit on Monday morning for an A.F.L.-C.I.O. event, take in a game of the minor league Mud Hens team in Toledo, then wrap up the marathon in Peoria, Ill.
"I'm beginning to think that vice-presidential candidates should have collective bargaining rights," Mr. Lieberman said of the pace. "You know, this guy's working me."
After stopping at Pat's, a well-known cheese steak restaurant in Philadelphia, Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman made their way to the dusty construction site, which leaked water in a driving rain. They addressed a carefully screened group of construction workers -- some work on the project, some do not -- and tried out the campaign's theme for the week, stewardship of the economy.
"If you want a job done right, have it done by union workers," Mr. Gore said. "If you want a job done right on our economic policy, take a look at the blueprint. There are two competing blueprints."
The Democratic plan, he said, would mean a balanced budget, securing Social Security and Medicare, investing in education, and tax cuts aimed at the middle class.
"I will not accept the blueprint from the other side," he said, "that proposes to give away all the surplus in a giant tax cut to the wealthy at the expense of the middle class, that stops our prosperity and progress.
"We tried the other side's approach before, and you saw what happened eight years ago, with the high unemployment and the big deficits."
Some workers at the event said they knew little about politics or economic policy, beyond the remarkable growth they have seen under President Clinton and Mr. Gore.
Patrick Stafford, 21, an electrician, said, "Clinton did a real good job with the economy, and Gore was his V.P., so he's the next-best thing to Clinton if we can't have Clinton. Also, Gore's pro-union and Bush isn't."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE GORE STRATEGY;
Still Riding Wave, a Confident Gore Heads to Florida for Fall Push

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore begins the fall stretch of the presidential campaign buoyant in the polls and brimming with confidence.
Perhaps the strongest sign of this self-assurance is the Gore campaign's visible grab for Florida, a state that has been perceived as favoring Gov. George W. Bush for months and where Mr. Bush's brother Jeb is the governor. Gore operatives say they are now slightly ahead in Florida. Mr. Gore has visited the state twice in the last week and is popping into Tampa on Monday morning during his 24-hour whirlwind Labor Day tour. 
 In addition, advisers said, either Mr. Gore or Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Mr. Gore's running mate, will visit Florida at least once a week from now through the November election, as they will regularly visit other battlegrounds that are becoming increasingly more plausible for the Democrats: Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.
And while the campaign has already bought television time in three swing markets in Florida -- Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach -- it is planning a big investment in Miami, Tallahassee and other areas as early as this week.
"When we turn on the lights there," said one top Democrat, "watch out!"
There is no question that the Gore team is pumped and basking in a spate of positive media coverage. But its euphoria is tempered with caution. There are tricky shoals for Mr. Gore to navigate, and the campaign has some decisions to make. These concern how he will respond to attacks from Mr. Bush, how to present himself as a change from President Clinton even while advocating many of Mr. Clinton's policies, and how to counter the impression of voters that Mr. Gore is weaker on certain personality traits.
A memorandum from Hickman-Brown Research Inc., a firm that conducts polls for the Gore campaign, says that Mr. Gore has made strides in important ways. His personal popularity is up, it says, and voters agree with his positions on most issues that are most important to them and have more faith in him than in Governor Bush to carry out certain presidential duties, like managing foreign policy and preparing the country for the future.
But the memorandum also says that Mr. Gore has shown major improvements in some areas of vulnerability. The pollsters refer to these as "key personal dimensions," which they define as traits related to leadership and trustworthiness, although Republicans perceive him as vulnerable on matters of credibility.
Governor Bush is an aggressive opponent, however, flush with cash, and he has already demonstrated that he will not lie down for a Gore steamrollering. The Republicans, who have spent twice as much as Mr. Gore on television commercials, are on the air now skewering Mr. Gore's credibility on improving the campaign finance system.
Mr. Bush is also stepping up his criticism that the Clinton administration has squandered the opportunities of the last eight years. Republicans say that commercials in the works show Mr. Clinton making the same promises in 1992 -- for a middle-class tax cut, for a prescription drug benefit for the elderly -- that Mr. Gore is making today.
How severely, and how soon, should Mr. Gore respond? He has a reputation as a cutthroat competitor whose aggressiveness can fire up the partisans but alienate independents and swing voters. The Gore team is deploying countless surrogates, including Mr. Lieberman, to make the case against Mr. Bush. But there is some internal debate about the level on which Mr. Gore should engage.
His recent challenge that Mr. Bush should "put up or shut up," ridiculed by the Bush campaign as a playground taunt, gave a hint of Mr. Gore's eagerness to get in the fight. But the Democrats withheld a commercial they had prepared last week criticizing Mr. Bush's record in Texas. That is likely to be broadcast in the coming week.
Perhaps the most nettlesome question for the Gore campaign is how to take advantage of the humming economy. In times of peace and prosperity, the incumbent party is almost always rewarded. The good news for the Gore campaign is that internal polling suggests that in several important states, a majority of voters perceive the nation to be on the right track. This has historically been one of the most important indicators for whether or not incumbents are re-elected.
But for Mr. Gore to have climbed to his place in the polls only now suggests that other factors are at work. The central concern is that while voters appreciate the good times, there is lingering resentment toward Mr. Clinton over his personal behavior, creating a complex web of emotion that still seems to ensnare Mr. Gore.
Allan J. Lichtman, a political analyst at American University, who has written about the basic factors on which people vote, said: "The fundamentals are in Gore's favor. Peace, prosperity, tranquillity at home and a united incumbent party. Why has the race even been close? The Clinton scandals."
Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, said that of all the issues voters rank as important, one, declining moral values, hurts Mr. Gore most.
"This is the aftereffect of impeachment," Mr. Goeas said. "Voters didn't want Republicans to impeach Clinton because they thought it would rock the boat. Now that that is no longer an issue, they are indulging in a second emotion -- they didn't want Clinton impeached, but they think what he did was wrong."
Will Mr. Gore pay for that? He has worked hard to close the Clinton chapter, staging a "passing of the baton" ceremony before his convention last month and declaring himself in his acceptance speech his "own man." Still, the centerpiece of his campaign is the thriving economy, and the economy is the most sterling part of the Clinton legacy.
"This election is not an award for past performance," Mr. Gore told workers here today. "I'm not asking you to vote for me on the basis of the economy we had; I'm asking for your support on the basis of the better, fairer, stronger economy that we're going to create together over the next four years."
The coming week should reveal more of the Gore strategy as the vice president focuses on the economy, including in a major speech in Cleveland on Wednesday.
Mr. Gore's current strategy is to stick to the issues, and to try to make the campaign about the issues on which he has an advantage. Internal polling suggests that undecided voters side with Mr. Gore on health care, Social Security and the economy. They side with Mr. Bush on crime and moral values, and in many states they rate the candidates about even on education.
Democratic officials indicated that they were not so worried about the lack of support on crime, noting that it is not as big an issue as it was in 1992, and not one that swing voters are making their decisions on. Also, they suggest, few voters think Mr. Gore has had anything to do with crime rates anyway, so it is not very fertile ground for him.
But declining moral values are another matter. Mr. Gore is well aware of this, and it goes a long way toward explaining why he picked Mr. Lieberman, with his reputation for rectitude and his history of criticism of Mr. Clinton's personal behavior, as his running mate.
Mr. Goeas said that education and values ranked as the top issues for married women, and that married women, who make up 60 percent of female voters, tended to support Mr. Bush.
Tad Devine, a chief strategist for the Gore camp, said that at this point the campaign was trying to reach as broad an audience as possible. In the next few weeks, he said, different groups of people will click in to the election, and they will be "persuadable" at different times. He said the campaign was talking about broad themes now, but as the pool of persuadable voters shifted and shrank, the campaign would deliver its message more to specific audiences, largely through direct mail, radio advertising and campaign destinations.

A Taxing Question: Assessing Millionaire's Retreat

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG

DATELINE: BRIDGEWATER, Vt., Sept. 1

 BODY:
A couple of years ago, a very wealthy couple finished building a very large house in this southern Vermont hamlet.
It was truly a fine house, built of stone, nearly 13,000 square feet, set on 460 acres near the top of Stonegate Mountain, with panoramic views of verdant Vermont wilderness. 
 It was a house so large and so fine, in fact, that when it came time to bill its owners for property tax, the town's Board of Listers, as assessors here are known, put its value at about $6 million, a nearly unheard-of sum in a modest rural state where log cabins are still far more common than starter mansions.
That's not fair, protested the property owners -- Jim P. Manzi, former head of Lotus Development, whose stock in the company was worth $78 million when I.B.M. bought the business in 1995, and his wife, Glenda -- faced with an annual property tax bill of more than $100,000. (Or rather, their lawyers said it.) The house may have cost nearly $6 million to build, they asserted, but it is so idiosyncratic that no buyer would ever pay so much for it. The value of a property, they argued, is what it would bring on the market. They set the house's value at less than $2 million.
No, responded the Bridgewater listers. Under a Vermont Supreme Court ruling, cost is a valid measure of such a property's value, they argued; plus, by their calculations, $6 million was close to what recent sales of comparable property indicated the house would bring if sold. An insurance company appraisal also coincided with the $6 million figure. It was unheard-of, they said, but it was right, particularly in a super-charged economy.
"In the last five years or so, Vermont has become like the coast of Maine was -- the superrich are starting to discover it, and we are seeing that happen here," said Thomas K. Standish, chairman of the three-member Board of Listers. "We're the first to confront the fact that very high-end properties are scarce as hen's teeth."
Despite what the Manzis say, the home's features as described by the listers sound luxurious but hardly eccentric: seven fireplaces, radiant heat in the floors, stonework in the bathrooms and old barn beams used in the construction.
The dispute is now about two years old, with another hearing scheduled next week, but this much is clear: in a boom-time of got-rich-quick millionaires indulging their house fantasies, such tussles abound from the mountains of Vermont to the shores of Puget Sound.
In 1997, William H. Gates briefly questioned the assessors' estimate that the 40,000-square-foot high-tech house his Microsoft billions built near Seattle was worth more than $50 million, saying no one else would pay such a price. He later withdrew the objection, and the assessment has since risen to about $110 million, putting his annual property tax at over $1 million.
Also in 1997, Michael Dell, the Dell Computer mogul, challenged his county property-appraisal office in Austin, Tex., because it said his new 33,000-square-foot home was worth more than $22 million; he insisted it was worth no more than $5 million or $6 million. The two sides compromised this year on $12 million.
Over all, several hundred such disputes about extra-luxurious houses may be under way around the country, said Dick Netzer, a professor of economics and public administration at New York University and an expert on property taxation. And the conflicts are not limited to houses: in a classic tax case, he noted, the owners of the New York Stock Exchange argued decades ago that it should not be assessed at what it cost to build, because it had virtually no value to anyone but the exchange.
In towns like Bridgewater, with a population of about 960 people mainly of modest means, these tax conflicts can take on a tinge of David versus Goliath. Studies on other regions have found that the fanciest of houses are routinely underassessed, both because it is hard to place a value on unique properties and, some say, because towns lack the resources to fight legal challenges.
When towns are challenged, "they very frequently give way on legal battles about property taxes and zoning, in order to avoid the costs of litigation," Professor Netzer said. "It happens all the time."
But not in Bridgewater. Mr. Standish and his two fellow listers, elected officials paid $9 an hour for their time, have devoted more than 1,000 hours, they estimate, to fighting the Manzis' appeal, and they show no signs of flagging.
"The argument that the rich don't know what they're doing with their money, and will build toys they'll never get their money back out of is not a credible one, in our opinion," Mr. Standish said.
Mr. Manzi, through his Boston lawyer, Michael Lynch, declined comment on the dispute. Mr. Lynch provided only this written statement: "All property taxes assessed against the Manzis' Bridgewater property have been timely paid and will continue to be paid in the future. Any further comment would be inappropriate in light of the pending litigation."
Coming up in that case, which is before a state administrative judge, is testimony from Marc Nadeau, a developer and appraiser from Guilford, Conn., who has been hired by the town to testify about the market for superfancy houses.
In his recent experience, he said, top-of-the-line houses are in such demand it is hard to overspend on them. A house may be idiosyncratic, but that hurts "only if there's something terribly unusual or dysfunctional about it."
"If you had, hypothetically, 10 or 15 people who could buy a house like the Manzis' 10 or 15 years ago," he said, "now there are hundreds of them, and Vermont is a prime getaway market."
Mr. Standish said that the Manzis' side has argued that houses generally do not sell for astronomical sums in Vermont. They originally argued the valuation of the house should be $1.5 million, he said, and have since come up to $2.8 million.
That, the listers say, they still cannot accept. For one thing, 75 percent of the town's property taxes go to education, where they are sorely needed. But for another, they say, if they accept too low a valuation, and then the property is sold for much more, the state could deem the whole town underassessed, and everybody's taxes could go up.
Already, said Nelson Lee, the chairman of the town Board of Selectmen, Vermont's recent property tax reform is hurting Bridgewater, and cases like the Manzi house further fuel the anger among old-style Vermonters that is visible these days in the thousands of "Take Back Vermont" signs along the state's roads.
"People born in Vermont are having to give up their properties because of the tax rate being rammed down their throat by people who are like the Manzis," Mr. Lee said. "It's happening in Colorado, it's happening in Maine" he added. "You should see what's going on there. The gentrification and the tastelessness -- and the disregard of the local guy."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL MEMO;
And the Winner Is Gore, If They Got the Math Right

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
For many people who live here, presidential politics is an exciting and uncertain enterprise, where the fate of an ideological principle or, more important, a career, may hang on a slip in a debate or a brilliant 30-second commercial.
But for seven visitors seeking to impose a precision and predictability on political life that even those working in its midst cannot discern, Vice President Al Gore has already beaten Gov. George W. Bush of Texas -- sort of. 
 Those seven political scientists, among the more than 2,000 who gathered here this weekend for the 96th annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, have precise mathematical formulas that, if taken at face value, mean that the candidates, their handlers and the press should take the next nine weeks off.
Then, the day after Election Day, everyone could look up to see whether Mr. Gore's winning percentage of the two-party vote was the 52.8 forecast by James E. Campbell of the State University of New York at Buffalo, the 60.3 expected by Thomas M. Holbrook of the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, or something between. The political scientists presented their formulas at a panel on Thursday.
The predictions of six of the formulas depend heavily on the health of the economy, by one measure or another, and on presidential popularity or the candidates' standings in Labor Day polls. The seventh, offered by Helmut Norpoth of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, depends on how the nominee of the incumbent party did in the New Hampshire primary. Mr. Norpoth's formula, which allows a forecast as soon as the incumbent party's nominee is clear (in March this year), gave Mr. Gore 55 percent.
At one level, the formulas reflect the continuing tendency of political science to seek numerical precision by relating disparate facts: comparing roll call votes with House re-election rates, for example, or determining the frequency of pork-barrel spending by senators of different parties. In recent decades, one trend in political science as a discipline has been a struggle to seem as precise as physics, with equations as the tool.
But at another level, these formulas reflect an underlying advantage for the Gore campaign, an economics-based edge that these students of past elections say it will take major efforts by one or both campaigns to overcome.
Alan Abramowitz of Emory University said the data reflected the assumption that presidential elections are "largely a reflection on the performance of the incumbent president and the state of the economy."
But his formula and some of the others also include a discount when a party is seeking to hold the White House for a third term or more. That is one reason why despite President Clinton's high poll ratings and a booming economy, Mr. Abramowitz's forecast was toward the lower end of the range, expecting Mr. Gore to get 53.2 percent.
Mr. Holbrook said his formula and the others assumed that "both candidates will run pretty good campaigns."
In 1988, he acknowledged, Governor Bush's father outperformed the predictions because his opponent, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, ran a poor general election campaign.
Mr. Campbell, the lone acknowledged Republican on the panel, said that in past elections "glitches and gaffes" had accounted for no more than one or two percentage points. "Most of us are predicting that the fundamentals will shift the campaign so that it's pretty remote" that Mr. Bush will win, he said.
Elsewhere at the meeting, the panelists' colleagues were treating the election as something still worth studying. One group listened while producers of television commercials discounted their own importance.
Ray Strother, a Democratic media consultant, said that political advertisements often "don't work anymore." Noting that they are shown much more frequently than they were 30 years ago, he asked, "If ads are better, why do we have to show them three times more often to make them work?"
At another session, three Rutgers University political scientists examined the press coverage of Elizabeth Dole's campaign for the Republican nomination. Caroline Heldman, Susan J. Carroll and Stephanie Olson argued that "the repeated references to Bob Dole in article after article may have subtly undermined her independent stature as a presidential candidate in the minds of voters."
But the forecasters, taking comfort in their unanimity of expected result, were sticking by what the panel's chairman, James C. Garand of Louisiana State University, admitted some colleagues sneered at as "recreational political science."
As Christopher Wiezien of the University of Houston, with a 55.2 percent forecast for Mr. Gore, observed, "He still might lose, but based on our analysis, it's not very likely."

HEADLINE: With Clinton Due, Holbrooke Defends U.N.

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

 BODY:
With President Clinton preparing to visit New York this week for a meeting of world leaders at the United Nations, the American ambassador, Richard C. Holbrooke, said on Saturday that the United States must focus more on its ties with the organization, which he called "indispensable" to American foreign policy.
"American dollars spent on the United Nations are worthwhile," Mr. Holbrooke said in an interview. "We need to fix it and save it, rather than walk away from it or weaken it." 
 On Wednesday, Mr. Clinton will open a three-day series of speeches and round-table discussions by more than 150 heads of government, many of whom will also be talking privately in dozens of specially constructed conference nooks or in diplomatic missions around New York.
Mr. Holbrooke, who is completing a year as ambassador to the United Nations, has found much of his time consumed in lobbying his administration colleagues on international issues and in carrying out demands made on the United Nations by Congress. A group of congressmen who have often been hostile to the United Nations have established multiple hurdles to full American participation, blocking payment of past dues and some new assessments.
"The U.S. will have to have a more profound discussion on how the U.N. fits into its security objectives," Mr. Holbrooke said.
Mr. Holbrooke's potential foreign policy role in a new Democratic administration -- if Vice President Al Gore wins the presidency in November -- is the focus of unending speculation among other diplomats. But he said he intended to "work straight through until Jan. 20" no matter what the outcome of the election. His arrival here was delayed a year by Congressional blocks and federal ethics investigations, largely into his contacts with American embassies after he left a federal post.
He said that he did not disagree that reform was still needed in the United Nations and that, in his dealings with the organization's international civil servants, he had been "dismayed at the bureaucratic behavior and obstructionism."
But while Mr. Holbrooke has been vocal in criticizing United Nations shortcomings, especially when members of Congress are visiting, there is no doubt that his job has been made more difficult by Congressional restrictions imposed in the name of reform, other diplomats say.
Mr. Holbrooke and another ambassador, Donald Hays, a budget and management expert assigned full time to the American mission to the United Nations, have spent many hours fighting to get United States dues to the organization reduced -- to 22 percent of the regular budget, from 25 percent, and to 25 percent of peacekeeping costs, from just over 30 percent. Congress has demanded the reduction, but other member nations regard any reduction as a violation of treaty obligations.
It is far from certain they will succeed, most other diplomats say, since 188 nations will have to agree to let the richest country in the world cut back on payments geared to the American portion of the international economy, which is higher than the Congressional targets.
The American delegation has also had to expend much diplomatic capital this year to get the United States back on an important budget committee, where it had lost a seat because of other nations' anger at its failure to pay its dues.
When any peacekeeping operation is planned, Mr. Holbrooke must hold up a final decision by the Security Council for 15 days in order to notify Congress and give members the right to object. At the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a spokesman said that this was a pledge made voluntarily by the Clinton administration, not a Congressional rule, and that it reflected the administration's unwillingness to fight on Capitol Hill over United Nations issues.

HEADLINE: Stricter Rules for Tire Safety Were Scrapped by Reagan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 3

 BODY:
After the last huge recall of Firestone tires in 1978, when tread separation problems resulted in hundreds of crashes and dozens of deaths, Congress and regulators made a series of proposals to tighten federal tire standards. But the standards were not revised, and many of the same problems, including some that the proposals were designed to address, have arisen again in the 14.4 million Firestone tires being recalled now.
A Congressional report on the 1978 recall of 14.5 million Firestone 500 tires pointed out that the steel-belted radial tires had easily passed the government's tests -- devised in the late 1960's for biased-ply tires, an earlier technology -- but still failed in large numbers on the road. 
 Carter administration officials imposed one new requirement on the auto industry in 1980 and began drafting new tire regulations, government documents from that period show.
But all the moves to tighten tire regulation were stopped after Ronald Reagan became president and sought to reduce the regulatory burden on the then-beleaguered American auto industry. The only new rule, involving the disclosure of tires' capacity to carry weight, was rescinded. Also canceled were plans for more stringent tests and for mandatory devices to warn motorists when their tires became underinflated.
Some of the regulatory initiatives abandoned in 1981 are likely to come up again this week, as Congressional committees hold hearings into the current recall.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has received more than 1,400 complaints about Firestone ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires, the bulk involving tires installed on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles. The complaints and data supplied to the agency by Firestone attribute 88 deaths to the tires. Firestone has recalled all ATX and ATX II tires of the P235/75R15 size, which were made from 1990 to 1996, and has recalled Wilderness tires of the same size made since 1996 at its factory in Decatur, Ill.
The safety agency is also reviewing whether many more Firestone tires may need to be recalled. On Friday, it issued a consumer advisory suggesting that motorists replace another 1.4 million tires that Firestone has refused to recall.
Firestone estimates that 6.5 million of the 14.4 million tires covered in the current recall are on the road, and fewer than half those covered by the advisory.
Two provisions dropped in the early 1980's clearly would have made the current episode easier for consumers. One would have required that identification numbers be printed on exterior rather than interior sidewalls, making it simpler for consumers to determine if their tires were included in a recall or advisory. Another, enacted before the 1978 recall, required that independent tire dealers keep track of buyers' addresses, so that those customers could be contacted during a recall.
The year before the huge recall of 1978, Firestone had recalled 400,000 similar tires made in Decatur. The company insisted then, as it does now, that the problem was confined to that plant, but company documents obtained by regulators in 1978 showed that Firestone knew of a design defect affecting tires from other factories as well.
The 1978 recall and the current one are the two largest, by a wide margin, since tire regulation began in the 1960's. The earlier recall produced more than 14,000 complaints to regulators, but those complaints cited just 41 deaths. Firestone 500s were car tires, and few cars rolled over when their tires failed. The current recall involves far fewer complaints but more deaths, most of which have occurred when Explorers and other sport utility vehicles rolled over after the tires lost treads.
Even before the recall, House and Senate conferees were scheduled to decide in the next several weeks whether to let regulators proceed with plans to provide consumers with information on vehicles' tendency to roll over. One of the hearings this week will be held by Senator Richard C. Shelby, an Alabama Republican who has led efforts to block the release of the information. Senator Shelby, who has been traveling in Africa for the past month, has declined interview requests.
Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for safety and the environment, said in a recent news conference that Ford would favor any new tire regulations that improved safety. Ford opposes regulators' plans to rate vehicles' tendency to roll over, contending that the proposal does not measure this tendency accurately enough. Regulators have defended their plan, pointing out that automakers have opposed attempts to measure rollover propensity.
The government tests tires for endurance by running them for 34 hours at 50 miles per hour, and for speed by running them for 90 minutes at 70 to 85 miles per hour.
Stephen R. Kratzke, the associate administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said regulators were considering more stringent tests. Any new rules would probably not be limited to tires for sport utility vehicles and other light trucks, he said, but would also extend to car tires.
In response to disclosures that Ford subsidiaries overseas began replacing the tires last year, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said today on the ABC program "This Week" that the Clinton administration also wanted legislation requiring manufacturers to report recalls abroad.
Firestone officials declined to comment on whether they felt new tire regulations were needed. But Chuck Sinclair, a spokesman for Goodyear, the market-share leader, said tonight that the company did "see a need for change in the regulations" and had been working on this even before the current recall. Automakers say that they already demand better-quality tires than the regulations require.
Although the cause of the problems in 1978 was never publicly determined, Firestone did make changes to its tires, and the problems stopped. But the episode crippled the company financially and contributed to its takeover in 1988 by the Bridgestone Corporation.
Firestone recovered from the 1978 recall by replacing virtually all the tires itself, which kept customers coming back to its dealers. But Ford has insisted that Firestone reimburse customers who buy other brands this time.
Back in 1981, as the Reagan administration began reviewing its predecessor's regulatory backlog, the American auto industry had laid off 500,000 workers and was close to bankruptcy. Chrysler had just been rescued with government loan guarantees.
While high interest rates and high gasoline prices were partly responsible, auto executives also blamed the high cost of government regulation, and President Reagan sought to ease this burden.
One tire regulation proposed at the end of the Carter administration, and canceled by President Reagan, would have required that vehicles alert their owners to low tire pressure, either with a light on the dashboard or with a red button that would pop up from the tire's valve.
Inflation has been a big issue in the current recall. Firestone has recommended that Explorer tires be inflated to 30 pounds per square inch, after acquiescing for a decade to Ford's recommendation of 26 pounds.
Tom Baughman, Ford's director of light truck engineering, has acknowledged that Explorer tires could suffer damage if the pressure fell below 20 pounds, but said that 26 pounds provided an adequate margin of safety.

HEADLINE: A Skid Row Turned SoHo In Downtown New Orleans;
Arts Projects (and the Failure Of a World's Fair) Revitalize Warehouses on the Mississippi

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS

 BODY:
All around the National D-Day Museum, which landed here on June 6, an invasion of art is refashioning New Orleans's once forlorn warehouse district into a chic enclave of culture and condominiums.
Old cotton mills and warehouses that stockpiled cargoes from the Mississippi River as far back as the 1830's are being transformed into art galleries, artist studios, lofts, hotels, cafes and restaurants in an expanding hundred-acre area of some 50 blocks. A museum of Southern art is rising near a former German brewery that tells the story of the victory over Hitler, and another large conversion is turning an old industrial building into artist studios, antidotes to the crime that long plagued the derelict warehouse district, sandwiched between the French Quarter and the Garden District. 
 While it began as a renewal district bounded by Poydras Street and Howard Avenue from the Convention Center Boulevard to Magazine Street, by some definitions its western boundary has been pushed back close to the Superdome, almost doubling its territory and taking in much of the business district.
"It was skid row," said Donna Perret, director of Galerie Simone Stern, one of the early arrivals. She recalled warily walking the district's streets. "I had a guard to make sure I wasn't mugged and could get to my car," she said.
Now gallery hopping in the warehouse district is joining the city's traditional infatuations with dining and jazz. In an open-house program called "Art for Art's Sake," the galleries, about 20 sprinkled around the spine of Julia Street, stay open late on the first Saturday of each month. Thousands of revelers converged on the district on Aug. 5 for the sixth annual White Linen Night, featuring gallery receptions and (this being New Orleans) street music and cash bars, culminating in a party at the Contemporary Arts Center, a converted pharmaceuticals warehouse that became a home for visual and performing arts programs in 1976.
There was ample cause for celebration, said Patricia Gay, executive director of the Preservation Resource Center, a private nonprofit organization that has been guiding the revival from an 1832 town house on Julia Street. "Whatever we do, we end up having a party," she said.
But there is nothing frivolous about much of the art on display. One prime showcase, the Arthur Roger Gallery on Julia Street, featured the patterned paintings of Robert Gordy, the fanciful sculptures and paintings of Ida Kohlmeyer and the work of the Shreveport sculptor Clyde Connell, known for her totemic figures. It also recently showed giant granite monoliths sculptured by Jesus Bautista Moroles of Rockport, Tex., who was featured in a show of Hispanic artists at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1989.
Many industrial districts, from SoHo to the downtowns of Newark, Pittsburgh and Cleveland, can claim degrees of revivals sparked by arts projects. But the comeback here seems at least partly attributable to a commercial debacle: the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition nearby at the riverfront. The scandal-tainted fair, with accusations of improprieties, including kickbacks, lost $130 million when expected crowds failed to materialize. But by forestalling other development while drawing architectural talent to the city, the flop appears to have planted seeds for today's preservation and redevelopment.
"Even though the fair was an economic failure, it revitalized the district," said Lea Sinclair Filson, director of public relations for the ultra-luxurious Windsor Court Hotel downtown, not far from the district. (In 1998 Conde Nast Traveler called it the best hotel in the world.)
She and her husband, an architect, recently moved into a warehouse they renovated. "It brought locals back to the river, like a renaissance," she said. "We have fond memories of the world's fair."
Success, when it came, seems to have priced out many artists. "We never went through the loft phase," said Ms. Gay, contrasting the New Orleans experience with that, say, of New York, where artists colonized cheap manufacturing lofts, only to be priced out by the gentrification they engendered.
Still some artists have taken up residence in the warehouse district, which abuts (some would say encompasses) another historic district, Lafayette Square. "We just sort of discovered it," said Ellen Pincus, a jeweler whose work in silver and gemstones is on display in Ariodante, a crafts gallery on Julia Street. She and her boyfriend, who both moved here in February from Chicago, pay $920 a month for a one-bedroom apartment in a converted cotton mill on Poeyfarr Street. She said they would like more space but find the rents steep.
Still, she said, they love the warehouse district and the opportunities. They were promptly put on a jury for the independent film festival at the Contemporary Arts Center.
"In Chicago I couldn't have gotten on a jury," she said. "It's like they were thanking us for just showing up. It's very bizarre here, actually." But best of all, she said, she sold some earrings to the novelist Anne Rice, who has a house in the Garden District.
Two other big openings in the warehouse district are set for next year: the Ogden Museum of Southern Art of the University of New Orleans, housing one of the largest such collections in the nation, and Louisiana ArtWorks, a 78,000-square-foot complex of ateliers and demonstration studios for artists inside the preserved shell of the old Bradford Furniture Store, put up before World War I.
Meanwhile the Ogden, being built around 1,200 works donated by the philanthropist and businessman Roger H. Ogden, has opened a temporary site two blocks away on Julia Street. One recent exhibition featured artists' views of daily life in the South during World War II, a show intended to mesh with themes at the D-Day museum.
The Ogden's new director, J. Richard Gruber, who came from Atlanta, where he was founding director of the Morris Museum of Southern Art, said the gallery scene was already more concentrated here than in Atlanta and benefited particularly from the strong emotional draw of the D-Day museum.
Clearly the biggest sign of the turnaround is the D-Day building, a reconstruction of the Weckerling Brewery. Built in 1887, it has been expanded to 70,000 square feet at Magazine Street and the former Howard Avenue, which was recently renamed Andrew Higgins Drive in honor of the New Orleans shipbuilder who produced the war's crucial 20,000 invasion boats. With its stark wartime artifacts and mixed-media exhibitions, the museum has proved so popular, particularly with World War II veterans and their families, that it issues timed-entry tickets to ease the flow of 1,300 visitors a day.
A second phase of construction is expected to expand the museum's scope to the Pacific war, with the opening of a 5,000-square-foot exhibition scheduled for Dec. 7, 2001.
But the boom has its downside. "We recently lost two artists because someone bought the building," said Ms. Perret, the gallery director. "They had to leave."
Still, this is a far cry from the problems of old, as remembered by Beverly Gianna, vice president for public affairs at the Metropolitan Convention and Visitors Bureau. It was not so long ago, she said, that the population of the warehouse district numbered two, both of them living on the street. Now, she said, some 5,000 people have moved in.
Ms. Perret of Galerie Simone Stern noted that "crime is down because people are stabilizing the neighborhood."
"It's more than a patina," she said. "It's settled. It's going to stay."
Ms. Perret said she found the warehouse district more alluring even than the somewhat larger French Quarter that remains the city's biggest tourist draw. "I love the Quarter like a village," she said. "But there's an energy here."

CORRECTION-DATE: September 11, 2000, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article in the arts pages on Monday about a culture boom in the warehouse district of New Orleans misstated a previous title of J. Richard Gruber, director of the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, and referred incorrectly to his former museum. Mr. Gruber was founding director of the Center for the Study of Southern Painting at the Morris Museum of Art, not founding director of the Morris Museum of Southern Art.
The article also misstated the location of the Morris Museum. It is in Augusta, Ga., not Atlanta.

HEADLINE: 2 Candidates, 1 Plan: Spend the Surplus

BYLINE: By Stephen S. Roach; Stephen S. Roach is the chief economist and director of global economics at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

 BODY:
As we head full force into the presidential campaign, one thing is certain. George W. Bush and Al Gore both seem determined to spend a significant portion of the nation's budget surplus.
The surpluses are now expected to total about $4.5 trillion over the next decade, and the economic programs of both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore could absorb as much as half that amount. If the Social Security balance is stripped out of the 10-year budget projections, the candidates then propose to spend virtually all of the remaining surplus. 
 They would spend the projected budgetary windfall in different ways. The Bush plan is far more focused on tax relief. The Gore plan is heavily skewed toward spending on health care and education. But these differences are less important than the common thrust of their budget policies.
If either of these plans comes to pass, the political economy of the 1990's, which helped drive the country's longest period of prosperity, could be turned inside out. The era of fiscal restraint would be over. The days of fiscal expansion would be back.
Politicians argue that it is the people's money, and that they have every right to reclaim what is rightfully theirs. Economists see it differently. The United States is a savings-short nation -- that is, American consumers set aside next to nothing of their current income for savings. In fact, the personal saving rate has now slipped into negative territory, hitting an all-time low in June of minus two-tenths of 1 percent as a share of disposable personal income.
But our economy still has huge financing needs. Funds for investing in new technologies, other capital equipment, offices, factories and homes must come from somewhere.
A savings-short America now gets this money from two sources -- the federal government's savings (that is, the surplus) and capital from abroad. Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore are, in effect, proposing to eliminate one of the two major sources of saving that America must now rely on.
Moreover, notwithstanding optimistic projections of the future, today's America is a nation in debt. Federal debt held by the public totals $3.4 trillion. The United States also owes $1.1 trillion to overseas investors, making it by far the world's largest debtor nation. In that context, it seems almost ludicrous to go on a federally financed spending binge. It would be far more prudent to simply pay down the debt.
Moreover, these projected surpluses may never come about. Today's 10-year projections are based on rosy scenarios that are strikingly reminiscent of those offered by the Reagan administration in the 1980's -- no recessions, no inflation and no interest-rate gyrations.
Such cockeyed optimism should raise suspicions. Should those forecasts fall wide of the mark and should politicians commit to tax cuts or huge increases in spending, the days of budget deficits could return with a vengeance.
It wasn't all that long ago -- 1993 to be precise -- when the Congressional Budget Office predicted that the federal government would be running a $455 billion deficit in the current fiscal year. Instead, this year's budget could well have a surplus in excess of $225 billion, meaning the budget office was off by a whopping $700 billion when it tried to project far ahead.
But let's say our prosperity continues and the optimistic budget projections come to pass. What then? In that case, increases in spending and tax cuts are probably ill-timed.
While the pace of our economic growth may be easing a bit from the heady gains of the past few years, the unemployment rate -- 4.1 percent in August -- remains near its lowest in a generation.
Large spending initiatives or tax cuts, like those being proposed by the candidates, typically boost the economy's growth rate. This move might lead to an overheated economy, where too much growth accelerates inflation, at just the time when most believe the battle against inflation has been won.
Offering tax cuts and increased government spending may play well on the campaign trail. But fiscal prudence has been central to America's newfound prosperity. It would be tragic to squander those gains for the sake of political expediency. Both candidates should pause for thought before turning back the fiscal clock.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Journal;
The Battle of the Hollywood Bowl

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 4

 BODY:
No one has conducted more performances at the Hollywood Bowl, under the stars and with the Santa Monica Mountains as a backdrop, than John Mauceri. "The Bowl," Mr. Mauceri, conductor of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, said the other day, "is magic."
But there have been too many nights in the middle of a concert when Mr. Mauceri has had to pick up the telephone at the conductor's stand on stage and whisper into the mouthpiece to the sound engineer that he is having trouble hearing the trumpets or the trombones. 
 For while the Bowl may be magic, the acoustics, Mr. Mauceri says, are simply terrible in its music shell, one of the most recognizable structures on the city's sprawling landscape. "It's extremely problematic," he said, "when the orchestra can't hear itself."
"Over the decades," Mr. Mauceri said of the shell, "all kinds of things have been put on it, glued on it and hung from it to improve the acoustics. Nothing has worked."
The 71-year-old shell is also too small for a 100-piece orchestra, and so about a third of the musicians are forced to sit outside it. Further, it is covered in asbestos and lead paint, and its roof leaks.
So the time has come, say Mr. Mauceri and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association, the Bowl's manager, for the shell to be demolished and replaced with a state-of-the-art 21st-century version costing $18 million.
The money was approved by voters in 1996, and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is to discuss the association's plan on Sept. 12. If the board approves, the project should be completed in 2002, and a shell 30 percent larger but otherwise looking very much like the current one will be standing in its place.
But just hold your baton a few beats, says the city's preservation movement. So much of the city's history has already been bulldozed under the seemingly endless rivers of freeway and acres of development that the Los Angeles Conservancy has come out against tearing down yet another piece of the past.
"We believe that the shell is the most identifiable icon of the entire Bowl facility," said Ken Bernstein, the conservancy's director of preservation issues. "We are not trying to stand in the way of quality music. We're just trying to raise the right questions and ensure all the alternatives to demolition are examined."
Since the current semicircular shell was erected in 1929, a parade of musical legends have performed on its stage, from Jascha Heifetz and Vladimir Horowitz to Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald to Bob Dylan and the Beatles. There are dance performances, too, and artificial stars light up the sky over the Bowl when the city comes together every Fourth of July to celebrate.
With all that in its past, "we believe this is a very, very serious step to lose the shell that has defined the Bowl for 71 years," Mr. Bernstein said.
In the last few days, the conservancy has had its first chance to study the philharmonic's environmental impact study on the demolition and its review of alternatives. Mr. Bernstein, for one, is impressed. "At this point," he said, "it does appear somewhat clearer it may be difficult to reconcile saving the shell with other needs."
Still, Mr. Bernstein said, the group remains officially opposed to demolition, at least for now. "This is a difficult issue," he said. "It's a wonderful place to listen to music, and we're not disrespectful of the acoustical issues. But the shell is an icon."
Patricia Mitchell, chief operating officer of the philharmonic, said the current shell was actually the Bowl's fourth since the first concert there, in 1922. The shell before this one was designed by Lloyd Wright, the eldest son of Frank Lloyd Wright; it was built in 1928 but lasted only one season before deterioration set in and it was demolished.
The current shell, made of a cement-asbestos mixture on a steel frame, was erected in 1929 and, the Bowl's souvenir book says, has become "an architectural icon as recognizable as the Eiffel Tower or the Statue of Liberty."
But it is not the shell where musicians spent summer evenings helping their audiences forget economic depression or world war. Over the years, the shell has had several major face lifts, including the installation of a reflecting pool that remained for a time right in front. ("It didn't work," Ms. Mitchell said. "The moisture from the water made it difficult for the instruments to keep tuned.")
Mr. Mauceri, who has conducted more than 200 performances at the shell in the last 10 years, said he agreed with the preservation movement that too much of old Los Angeles had been replaced by new, here-today-gone-tomorrow Los Angeles.
"I'm very sympathetic to preserving the cultural history of Los Angeles," he said. "But I think this is a case of misplaced concern. At what point in its history do you preserve the shell? The 1970 version? The 1980 version? The 1949 version? This is not the shell that Lloyd Wright designed."

HEADLINE: Urban Sprawl Threatens the Solitude and Fragile Lands of Georgia's State Parks

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

DATELINE: CARTERSVILLE, Ga., Aug. 31

 BODY:
Before metropolitan Atlanta began its relentless march north, bulldozing forests of loblolly pine and soybean fields, the Etowah Indian Mounds here was a remote state historic site where children visited the ancient burial grounds, and astronomers viewed the stars.
But now the site, about an hour northwest of Atlanta, borders a subdivision of 500 houses, whose roofs are visible from the ceremonial mound and whose lights obscure the constellations. Two other subdivisions are on the drawing board, off Old Alabama Road, which is soon to become a four-lane highway. 
 "It's closing in on us," said Libby Bell, the site's manager, who frets that a sod farm and a pasture flanking the mounds could give way to urban sprawl, despite promises from the owners that they will not sell. But Ms. Bell worries that when land is money, promises can be broken.
"What happens next?" she asked. "We could have subdivisions right up to the fence line."
The development at the perimeter of the Indian mounds, and at an additional 24 of Georgia's 63 state parks, earned the state the designation as most threatened in a recent survey by the National Park Trust, a Washington-based private land conservancy. According to the report, 8,212 of 74,542 acres of state parkland here is endangered by sprawl, commercial and residential development, traffic and rising land values, which all make it difficult for governments to buy open land.
The parks said to be in jeopardy, in states including Nevada, Florida and Ohio, are not themselves at risk of disappearing. Rather, they are ringed, or soon will be, by buildings, rushing traffic and neighbors who may consider fragile areas extensions of their backyards.
"The solitude you expect in a park is now being lost to high-rises, second homes and lawn mower noise," said Paul C. Pritchard, president of the National Park Trust. Urban encroachment, Mr. Pritchard said, turns "conservation areas into city parks, and historical sites into playgrounds."
That Georgia was at the top of the list came as no surprise to conservationists, urban planners, political leaders and residents here, who have watched their state -- and especially the 16-county greater Atlanta area -- explode in the last decade, unfettered by geographic barriers like mountains or oceans, and encouraged by the region's laissez-faire attitude toward regulating land use.
The threat to the parks, said Lawrence Frank, a professor of city planning at the Georgia Institute of Technology, is "one of the unthought-out, less measured impacts of rapid, unplanned growth," more often discussed in terms of choking traffic, unsightly strip malls, cookie-cutter subdivisions and air like ozone soup.
"We used to laugh at Los Angeles," said Vince Taylor, manager of the Sweetwater Creek state park in Lithia Springs, the closest to downtown Atlanta and destined to be ringed by office parks and condominiums. "Now we are Los Angeles."
Mr. Taylor, whose park is a 2,050-acre oasis just 15 miles from city skyscrapers, is more resigned to development than Ms. Bell, who grew up in Lilly, Ga., (population 50) and assumed when she came here 21 years ago that the Etowah Mounds would remain pristine and that adjoining lands, also troves of Indian artifacts, would not be disturbed.
Mr. Taylor, who grew up in Decatur and witnessed Atlanta's sprawl from its earliest days, had no such expectations. "The certainty is we will be surrounded," he said, from the bait shop at Sweetwater, which includes a 215-acre manufactured lake stocked with fish, the ruins of a Civil War-era textile factory, hiking trails and a butterfly garden. "The uncertainty is by what."
Already, there are small subdivisions at the edges of Sweetwater Creek and a few apartment complexes, including one with placards promising that "luxury living is a walk from the park." As he inspects his territory, Mr. Taylor is dismayed to find deer blinds, children's forts and yard cuttings on park property.
Recently, ground was broken on the park's southern border for a mini-city called New Manchester, which will occupy 3,350 acres on both banks of Sweetwater Creek, a tributary of the Chatahoochee River. New Manchester, named for the ruined textile factory, is to include homes for 9,000 people, office space for 25,000, a golf course, a hotel, a school and paths that connect to the trail system at the park. The enormous project does not disturb Mr. Taylor or his superiors in the State Department of Natural Resources because they say it is thoughtfully designed.
"We could have a lot worse neighbors," Mr. Taylor said, "and eventually we will."
He worries about an untouched tract of land adjacent to New Manchester, approved for multifamily dwellings, that has changed hands several times. Then there is the vast acreage, already bought by speculators, that is yet to be connected to the Douglas County sewer system. Once it is, Mr. Taylor said, dirt roads are likely to become four-lane highways, and forests of oak and hickory will give way to office parks.
But office parks, "if they are nicely done," may be preferable to housing, Mr. Taylor said, because they are in use only from 9 to 5 and tenants are unlikely to use, or misuse, the parkland. Residents, by contrast, make it difficult to "control our borders," he said, and wear footpaths through delicate areas.
The development at the edge of both the Etowah Indian Mounds and the Sweetwater Creek state park might have been prevented had adjoining property been bought by the state or donated by landowners. Donations of this kind are less common since changes in the tax code in 1986 made deductions for philanthropy less generous. And purchases have been stymied recently by rising costs and static public financing.
Georgia's governor, Roy Barnes, a Democrat, is widely praised for initiatives to make land acquisition easier, including one that provides $300 million to the state's most rapidly developing counties for buying green space, with a goal of 20 percent per county. But Mr. Barnes is playing catch-up. "He inherited a total mess," Professor Frank said.
Help could also come with the resurrection of a ballot measure, which Georgia's voters rejected two years ago, to add $1 to the real estate transfer tax for land acquisition in natural areas. The fund would have yielded $30 million in its first year, said Bert Weerts, director of the state's parks and historical sites.
Finally, there is pending federal legislation, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, which has passed in the House of Representatives and is expected to be considered soon by the Senate. The bill would give $450 million to the states for land acquisition, with $10 million to $18 million coming to Georgia, Mr. Weerts said.
Mr. Weerts was one of 32 state park executives who responded to the survey by the National Park Trust. In those 32 states, the report said, there are 94,306 acres of threatened parkland. The top 10 states -- Georgia, North Carolina, Minnesota, Nevada, West Virginia, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Montana -- account for 62,013 acres, about two-thirds of the total. Among the 18 that did not respond were California, Texas and New York, the nation's three most populous states, and Alaska, its largest.
Park officials here took no offense at their ranking, instead hoping that it would draw attention to their plight. Ms. Bell, for one, would jump at any new state or federal money that would make it possible to buy land at the edges of her 54-acre historical site. The Etowah mounds were purchased for preservation in 1953, for a nominal fee, from the Tumlin family.
The Tumlins, major landowners in Cartersville since 1838, have sold most of their 3,000 acres, including a 23-acre sod farm owned by Shaw Industries, one of the nation's largest carpet mills. Henry Tumlin, 83, who lives next to the park, which he once managed, has known the "Shaw boys," as he calls them, since childhood, and is confident they will keep their vow to leave the land undeveloped.
Given the wealth of Shaw Industries, Ms. Bell is reasonably sure that the agricultural land will not be sold. She is less confident about the 50-acre pasture that Mr. Tumlin still owns, where cows graze within sight of a 63-foot ceremonial mound, home to Indian priests and chieftains 1,000 years ago. Mr. Tumlin and his wife, Charlsie, 84, have no children but have willed the pasture to two nephews on the condition that they keep the land in the family. One nephew is a dentist, Mrs. Tumlin said. The other is a builder.

HEADLINE: Nigerian Leader Seeks Peacemaking Role

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Fifteen months after restoring democracy to Africa's most populous nation for the second time in 20 years, President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria said today that he was ready to step into a larger role in mediating an end to his continent's debilitating wars, beginning with Congo.
In an interview shortly after his arrival in New York for a gathering of world leaders, Mr. Obasanjo, whose troops the United States is now training for peacekeeping duties in Sierra Leone, said he recently volunteered to go to Congo and talk to President Laurent Kabila. Mr. Kabila has been the primary roadblock to efforts to end the war, which involves a half dozen African nations, and has been uncooperative with both the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. 
 Mr. Obasanjo's offer was turned down by Secretary General Kofi Annan, he said. "I wanted to go, and I told the secretary general, and I was told that it was not opportune yet for me to go," Mr. Obasanjo said.
They agreed to send Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who during a short period as Nigeria's military ruler opened the way for the election last year of Mr. Obasanjo.
Mr. Obasanjo remains ready, he said. "I will go," he said, adding that his message is simple. "Mr. Kabila, your country needs peace. Nothing should be too much to sacrifice for peace."
As wars have further weakened countries in sub-Saharan Africa already devastated by economic problems and AIDS, Mr. Annan and other world leaders have tried to involve Africans more actively in peacemaking. Nelson Mandela, South Africa's former president, has negotiated a tentative peace agreement in Burundi. But tensions between South Africa and Congo have prevented him from playing a greater role there, where Rwanda, Uganda, Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe all have forces.
Mr. Obasanjo, who said he had also been asked for advice by the military government of the Ivory Coast, acknowledged that Nigerians were waiting for a "democracy dividend," but that this should not mean he had to look inward.
Nigeria, he said, was not grabbing power, "but if a situation comes to which we must react positively in the interest of our subregion, or in the interest of our continent or even in the interest of the world, we would be less than what we should be if we did not react."
Until now, Mr. Obasanjo, 65, has seemed reluctant to shoulder more continental responsibilities because he has his own priorities in Nigeria, now struggling to recover from another period of military rule that left the country isolated, deeply in debt and facing Christian-Muslim tensions. He seemed eager to withdraw troops from an earlier peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone. Shortly after taking office, he pressed for an agreement signed in Lome, Togo, last year ending the war. But flaws in that agreement led to a resurgence of fighting in May.
"I said that Nigerian troops cannot remain forever in Sierra Leone, so we must work out some process by which Nigerian troops could start the process of disengaging," he said today. "That was why we went for the Lome agreement."
"Of course we will always have domestic priorities," he said. "But our domestic priorities must never prevent us from being a good neighbor."
Speaking as a general, he offered a prescription for Sierra Leone. "We must be strong militarily, but we must not throw completely overboard what I call the political option," he said. But he ruled out any future political role for Foday Sankoh, the rebel leader of the Revolutionary United Front who resumed the war this year and captured 500 United Nations peacekeepers. "Foday Sankoh is no longer an issue," he said.
He said he was also appealing to President Charles Taylor of Liberia, who has been complicit in Mr. Sankoh's rebellion and is accused of funneling diamonds from Sierra Leone through his country to raise money for arms. Speaking of "doing what needs to be done as quickly as possible" in Sierra Leone, he said, "What needs to be done is disarmament, demobilization of everybody."
Mr. Obasanjo said speed was important in Congo also. "We have to move quickly to get those troops that should not have been there out of the place," he said.
He said he thought that the nations involved, including Zimbabwe, which is propping up the Kabila government, could not continue spending money on this war. "The cost of maintaining troops outside your own territory must be telling on Zimbabwe," he said. "We know from experience what it is."

HEADLINE: Security Council Looking At Its Peacekeeping Bills

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 4

 BODY:
The five permanent Security Council members plan to use their collective influence this week and call for a revision of how peacekeeping costs are divided among member nations, a move that would -- at least on paper -- help Washington in its battle to reduce American assessments.
The review of peacekeeping bills, which has to be conducted through a committee of member nations, would be intended to help put the faltering and cash-strapped peacekeeping department on a firmer financial footing. 
 The five members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- will meet on Thursday as part of a separate Security Council "summit within a summit" meeting of more than 150 government leaders. Both the full 15-member council and its core of permanent members will issue declarations for the day.
The permanent members' final draft calls for adjusting the payment scale for peacekeeping costs "in light of changed circumstances." The scale was established in 1973 to cover an operation in Sinai and has never been revised.
At that time, the permanent members, who hold veto power, were asked to pay a premium for peacekeeping on top of their fair share of costs based on their national economies. Other industrial nations paid just their share. Smaller or poorer nations paid as little as 10 or 20 percent of what they would usually be charged. A complex formula of special discounts claimed by many nations further skewed the system.
Based on 1973 economic figures, the United States was assessed more than 30 percent and China less than 1 percent, a gap that has rankled American officials in recent years. Russia is still assessed as if it were the Soviet Union.
China has generally acknowledged that the system is out of date and unfair, given the changes in the economic fortunes of many nations. Saudi Arabia and Singapore, for example, pay minimal amounts. But Chinese officials have refused to agree to a significant increase in their bill.
Diplomats say with the economy of Hong Kong now calculated in with that of the rest of China, Beijing will no longer be able to make a case for poverty, even taking into account its large population.
In Washington, Congress has already ruled that the United States will pay no more than 25 percent of its bill -- when it pays at all. That contributes to an ever-widening American debt, because member nations do not recognize moves like this from individual countries.
Reopening formal debate on a new payment scale will take a long time, diplomats said, because 189 countries will all have opinions to offer and limits to negotiate. But lobbying by the permanent council members will help the process.
In general, the permanent five will recommend in their statement this week that the financial base of the United Nations, both the regular budget, which is assessed separately, and peacekeeping "must accurately reflect the capabilities and responsibilities of every member state."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VOTERS;
Hearing About God but Wondering About Issues

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: DENVER, Sept. 3

 BODY:
All the talk of faith and religion in the presidential campaign might be expected to gain the attention of a voter like Sarah Dotson, 28, who rose early this morning to attend Mass at Holy Ghost Roman Catholic Church here.
She had noticed, all right. And that was the problem. 
 "Frankly, it makes me a little uncomfortable," said Ms. Dotson, who clutched a prayer book as church bells pealed on this Sunday morning. "I've heard enough from the candidates about how they pray. I want to hear how they're going to keep the economy going."
Voters could scarcely miss the expressions of religious faith by candidates in this presidential campaign.
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee, declared a "Jesus Day" in his state. Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, has described himself as a born-again Christian who often asks himself, "What would Jesus do?"
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, who is an Orthodox Jew, has urged that religious faith play a stronger role in American life.
But for all the soul baring by candidates, more than three dozen voters interviewed around the country in the past few days expressed little interest in weighing the religious convictions of candidates in choosing the next president.
As Kim Cart, a 29-year-old store clerk in Vinton, La., put it, with a chuckle, "As long as he's not into Satanic rituals, I really don't care about a politician's religious beliefs."
Even those who consider themselves religious, like Dee Bobbitt, a 47-year-old waitress who teaches Sunday school and helps clean the First Assembly of God Church in suburban Houston, did not place much emphasis on the religious views of a candidate.
"I care more if they're smart," said Mrs. Bobbitt, who thinks President Clinton "has done a wonderful job," no matter that he might not agree with her views on the sinfulness of drinking, smoking, dancing and gambling, not to mention sex outside marriage. "I'd like to say that it does matter if a president is religious, but it just doesn't."
Those interviewed also tended to express a skepticism about the sincerity of the religious views of candidates.
Bob Doby, a 41-year-old truck driver from Stockton, Calif., shook his head with impatience at the religious ponderings of politicians.
"It's just a way to try to get votes, that's all," said Mr. Doby, who added that he did not believe in God. "I'm jealous of people who can go to church and find solace. I can't. Some people can, and that's cool. But it's got nothing whatsoever to do with running the country. It just doesn't have any relevance, and they ought to stop talking about it."
Shaunessy McNeely, a 21-year-old nursing student, who attended Riverside Baptist Church here, said she could not help noticing that politicians mostly like to preach to the choir and keep quiet if they think an audience is not receptive.
"Jesus Day in Texas -- how hard is that?" Ms. McNeely said laughing, adding that it was scarcely a profile in religious courage for Mr. Bush to issue such a proclamation in a state with so many evangelical Christians. "Is he going to go to San Francisco, to Manhattan, and say, 'Rah, rah, Jesus.' If he does, then I'll be impressed."
David Carey, a 48-year-old Roman Catholic who works for an insurance company here, said he appreciated that candidates were trying to "invoke a higher moral standard." But Mr. Carey said it was folly to try to assess which candidate seemed to be more religious.
"When the candidates talk about religion, I just ignore them," he said. "It says more about what the politicians think of the voters, and what they think the voters want to hear."
To be sure, a few voters said the candidates should be talking more about religion, not less.
"The morals of the country are shot, and God is the only way to bring things back," said Bruce Abel, a 53-year-old kitchen designer, who was on his way to Riverside Baptist Church here. "Belief in God has shaped this country from the founding, and God's hand needs to be in politics today."
If Mr. Clinton had been more religious, Mr. Abel said, the nation would not have been forced to endure the sex scandal that nearly drove him from office.
"But Clinton getting elected was all part of God's plan," he said. "It was part of a lesson for us."
Some voters said it was healthy for candidates to talk about religion, as long as they did not push a particular faith.
Merrill Goldberg, a 57-year-old math teacher from Shawnee Mission, Kan., said he thought it was odd that people seemed uncomfortable talking about religion but did not so much as shrug over the saturation of sex and violence in today's culture.
"With all that garbage out there, I would hope it would be permissible to talk about God, too," Mr. Goldberg, an Orthodox Jew, said. "To me, religion is equated with morality. So I don't have a problem with that. But it crosses the line when you promote a particular religion."
Among the candidates, Mr. Lieberman tended to be seen as the most sincere about his expressions of faith. "He doesn't just say it," Ms. Cart said, "he lives it."
Dick Rosenberg, a 61-year-old real estate investor here, who described himself as a nonpracticing Jew, said he also admired Mr. Lieberman. Nonetheless, Mr. Rosenberg said he wished the senator would stop talking so much about religion.
"Religion shouldn't be used as a marketing tool," he said, supporting the call by the Anti-Defamation League for Mr. Lieberman to refrain from talking about his religion. "It's a private deal, so keep it private."
Even among voters who said their religion shaped their voting, there was plenty of disagreement about the political will of God, judging from the disparate views among people who shared pews in the same church.
Donna Loper, a 61-year-old secretary who attended Holy Ghost Church, said her convictions would prevent her from voting for a candidate who supported abortion.
"It's against church teachings," Ms. Loper said; "it can't be any clearer." She said she would be voting for Mr. Bush.
Michael Carrigan, 33, who also attended Holy Ghost, said his faith also shaped his ideology.
"My religion inspires my politics," Mr. Carrigan said. "The church calls us to social action and justice, to take care of the less fortunate."
He said he would be voting for Mr. Gore.
Few voters seemed more troubled by the religious talk than John Price, a 52-year-old management consultant, who was drinking coffee at an outdoor cafe here.
Mr. Price, a former resident of Oklahoma, recalled a conservative politician in that state running on a campaign that focused on "God, guns and gays."
He critcized Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore for making statements that "smacked of the cult of Jesus," appeals that he said risked dividing the American public.
"The only way religion is going to be an issue in the campaign for me," Mr. Price said, "is if somebody tries to force it on me."
Then he checked his watch, put down his coffee, and announced he was in a hurry to leave.
He was running late for church.

HEADLINE: GRIDLOCK IN THE SKIES: A special report.;
Crisis for Air Traffic System: More Passengers, More Delays

BYLINE: By By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN and MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
Today ends the second straight summer travel season of chronic flight delays and cancellations across the United States. Yet despite the expenditure of billions -- and repeated warnings over the last decade that the air traffic system was approaching gridlock -- there is still no relief in sight for frustrated fliers.
Indeed, most experts now believe that delays, which have risen nearly 50 percent the last five years, will become worse, not better. The Federal Aviation Administration, which runs the air traffic system, predicts that by 2010 the number of airline passengers will rise 59 percent, to one billion. About 70 percent of that increase is expected to occur at the country's 28 largest airports. 
 "I don't think there is anything on the drawing board right now that you can say with any credibility is the answer," said Kenneth M. Mead, inspector general of the Transportation Department, parent agency of the F.A.A.
"We wish there was a silver bullet," said Jane Garvey, the F.A.A. administrator, "but there is not."
The story of how the nation's air transportation system reached its current crisis can be traced back to one of the government's most successful economic initiatives -- airline deregulation -- and to one of its longest and most expensive bureaucratic blunders: the F.A.A.'s ill-fated attempts to develop a new air traffic control system.
It is a tale that involves so many disparate interests shouting one another down -- from grass-roots organizations to large corporations to municipalities to labor unions -- that politicians in Congress and the White House have simply let the system drift for years.
A recent review by Mr. Mead's office found that the F.A.A. and the Transportation Department do not even have the tools to determine the precise causes of most delays.
And so the airlines blame the F.A.A., charging that the hours planes sit idling on runways and the countless appointments missed by passengers because of an antiquated air traffic control system cost more than $5 billion last year alone. The F.A.A. counters that airlines knowingly schedule more takeoffs and landings at major airports than the system can handle. Both attack Congress for not appropriating enough money to fix the system, and localities for preventing the building of new runways at congested airports.
"It's gotten down to a big finger-pointing contest," said Thomas Brantley, national vice president of the Professional Airways System Specialists, the union of technicians who maintain the F.A.A.'s air traffic control equipment. "The reality is, everybody's got blame to share."
There are other factors at work, too. Eight years of economic growth has encouraged airlines to add flights, even as consumers complain about high fares. An unusual spate of thunderstorms this summer frequently left controllers with few avenues to reroute air traffic. And United Airlines, the world's largest carrier, was forced to cancel more than 20,000 flights over the summer, largely because of labor disputes, adding to the burden on passengers and other airlines.
Still, critics say that thunderstorms and the growth in passenger demand are predictable events that the system should handle without passengers' waiting half a day or more to reach their destinations. And those passengers are seething.
"It's not like we are having typhoons," said Sharon Mantel, a drug saleswoman heading to Chicago from LaGuardia Airport one morning in July. "Shouldn't technology be able to handle this? It's not like the airplane was invented yesterday."
Indeed, the answer to today's gridlock, whenever it comes, will involve new technology that lets controllers track more planes in the sky -- and, possibly, new economics that let market forces allocate the system's scarce resources.
Any changes, however, must guarantee the same high level of safety enjoyed now. For with all its flaws -- and despite a few deadly collisions on the ground -- the national air system has been remarkably successful at keeping big jets from flying into one another.
 
The Transformation
With Deregulation,
Sweeping Changes
 A generation ago, life was much simpler for airlines and air traffic controllers. Government regulators told the airlines when and where they could fly and how much they could charge. Bureaucrats made sure every city was served and that popular cities had no more service than they could handle.
The drawback was that flying was expensive, the preserve of an elite.
The deregulation of the industry in 1978 transformed air travel into mass transportation. It also hit the industry like an earthquake. Venerable carriers disappeared; low-fare upstarts rose and fell. The survivors established so-called hubs at major airports, increasing their efficiency by flying passengers in, transferring them to other planes, and flying them on to their final destinations.
Today, the airline industry carries three times as many passengers as it did in 1978 at average fares that are 40 percent lower, adjusting for inflation.
But while the industry was transformed, the air traffic control system has remained virtually unchanged. At its heart are a collection of ground-based navigation beacons and radar stations that divide the 3.5 million square miles of airspace over the continental United States into aerial highways over which most airplanes are dispatched single-file like railroad cars.
Because radar -- developed for the military in World War II -- is arguably better at spotting attack planes than tracking friendly jets, the F.A.A. has long stipulated that planes flying between cities be separated by at least 5 miles horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically. That clogs the routes taken by the 20,000 scheduled flights a day.
"A bunch of guys with slide rules, pocket protectors and tape on their glasses figured this out a long time ago," said William Blackmer, the top safety and technology expert at the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union for 15,000 F.A.A. controllers.
When a storm hits, controllers begin closing off highways and spacing planes farther apart, leading to long delays on the ground. Even when the weather is perfect, departures are not spread evenly throughout the day; for a hub to be successful, planes must arrive and depart in waves. Airlines also try to provide frequent service from their hubs for the convenience of business travelers, who pay the highest fares.
The irony is that inviting everybody to travel when they prefer means fewer planes arrive or depart on time. Mr. Mead, the Transportation Department's inspector general, found that airlines frequently schedule flights in numbers that would be beyond an airport's maximum capacity even in perfect weather, let alone on bad weather days, when departure and arrival rates can be cut in half.
For example, at Newark International Airport one day earlier this year, Mr. Mead found that airlines had scheduled more planes to take off than could be handled by the tower for four hours during the day. Last year, Newark had the second highest number of delays recorded by the F.A.A., after O'Hare International Airport at Chicago.
Continental Airlines, which uses Newark as a hub, said it had spread out arrivals and departures to stay below the airport's capacity throughout the day. It has also replaced smaller airplanes with larger ones, to keep takeoffs and landings flat while accommodating more passengers.
"If we scheduled fewer flights, then people couldn't travel," said Greg Brenneman, Continental's president. "It is not incumbent on the airlines to be the least common denominator here. It is incumbent on the government to have a system that allows people to travel when they want to travel."
Several government commissions have urged expanded use of secondary airports to ease the strain on the system. Southwest Airlines, the country's seventh-largest carrier, has had enormous success bypassing major airports, providing frequent service between cities like Baltimore and Providence or Dallas and Houston. That has helped Southwest achieve the best on-time performance of any major carrier. But the other airlines continue to favor the hub system.
The airlines would like to see busy airports enlarged; that is what both United and American Airlines would prefer at O'Hare, for instance, where they operate hubs. But residents near O'Hare oppose any expansion. Representative Henry J. Hyde Jr., their Republican congressman, has joined with Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., a Democrat from Chicago, to back construction of a new airport south of the city -- but the airlines have said they would not fly there.
Most other major airports also have difficulty expanding, either because there is no space, as is the case at Newark and LaGuardia Airport, or because of local opposition. From 1995 through 1999, only three new runways were put into service at the 28 biggest airports, according to the Transportation Department.
The introduction of smaller 50- and 70-seat jets has also increased congestion. These so-called regional jets are rapidly replacing propeller-driven planes on many commuter routes and are much preferred by passengers. But unlike prop planes, which fly at lower altitudes and can take off and land on shorter runways, regional jets act just as big jets do, adding to the competition for space on the ground and in the air.
In 1995, there were just 35 regional jets in the nation's fleet. Last year, there were 407. The Transportation Department estimates the number will grow 25 percent annually, comprising 19 percent of the total domestic fleet by 2011.
 
The New System
Plan With Promise
Triples Its Cost
 The growth in air traffic was supposed to be easily handled by a sophisticated system that the F.A.A. began developing in 1981. In the wake of that year's air traffic controllers' strike, when all 11,000 controllers were fired by President Reagan, the F.A.A. began looking for a system that would handle more traffic with fewer controllers.
What came to be known as the Advanced Automation System, was the centerpiece of a 10-year, $12 billion plan to modernize air traffic control. Though the overall system of radar and navigation beacons was unchanged, the plan promised to save billions of dollars by enabling controllers to "work smarter, not harder," the F.A.A. administrator at the time said.
It turned out to be a gigantic white elephant. In 1994, after its cost had tripled, the system's capabilities were shown to be much less than promised and it was still 10 years from completion, the F.A.A. decided to scale back the project dramatically. The money wasted, according to the General Accounting Office, amounted to $2.8 billion.
The failure was just the most dramatic example of the F.A.A.'s storied incompetence in procurement. For years, the agency has been rebuked by members of Congress and outside critics.
"The Federal Aviation Administration currently lacks the organizational, management, and financial wherewithal to keep pace with the dynamic aviation community," the National Civil Aviation Review Commission, a blue-ribbon panel set up by Congress, concluded in 1996. (The Commission also warned presciently that "rapidly growing demand combined with a reduction in capacity, as the result of continued reliance on outdated equipment, will bring our nation's aviation system to gridlock soon after the turn of the century.")
The F.A.A. has shown some improvement in the last five years. For one thing, Congress mandated a five-year term for the administrator, slowing the turnover at the top.
After the debacle with the Advanced Automation System, the F.A.A. adopted a much more modest approach to modernizing air traffic control -- a strategy Mrs. Garvey, the administrator since 1997, sums up as "build a little; test a little; deploy a little."
It replaced its old mainframe computers with newer ones and installed color radar display screens. System crashes, which in the 1990's frequently forced controllers to track jets on slips of paper, are now rare.
But many serious problems remain. The original $12 billion modernization program that was supposed to be completed in 1991 now has a budget of $40 billion through 2004 with no end in sight.
In addition, what the F.A.A. hails as modernization is the technological equivalent of a new coat of paint. The new mainframe computers that form the heart of the air traffic system are I.B.M. models built in the 1990's that have already gone out of production. The F.A.A. could not buy I.B.M.'s newest machines because they would not run Jovial, the 1960's programming language used in the system's software.
Jovial, which stands for Jules Own Version of the International Algebraic Language, was created by a programmer, Jules I. Schwartz, 40 years ago as part of a contract for the Strategic Air Command. The F.A.A. plans to switch to a more modern computer language, but the transition "is very complex and it is going to take literally years," said William Shumann, an agency spokesman.
The F.A.A. also had high hopes for a plan called the Wide Area Augmentation System, intended to use the constellation of military satellites that make up the Global Positioning System to enable planes to fly virtually independent of controllers on the ground.
It was supposed to be operating by 1998, but also proved much more complicated -- and expensive -- than the F.A.A. first thought. The system was made available on a very limited basis last week, but is not scheduled to be completed until 2002. Few believe it will make a significant contribution toward reducing delays.
"The F.A.A. parades these acquisitions before Congress like they know what they are getting, but they haven't figured out yet what they need," said Mr. Mead.
Meanwhile, a group of cargo carriers, frustrated by the F.A.A.'s failures, is developing its own air traffic system using satellites. Under this system, each airplane broadcasts its location and identity to all other airplanes. Every cockpit has a display screen, a miniature version of those in air traffic control centers, that tells pilots the flight paths and altitudes of other airplanes in the vicinity.
Because pilots and controllers have more precise information than is provided by the current radar-based system, airplanes can fly closer together in the sky and land and take off more closely on the ground. Now, for example, pilots must wait for clearance from the tower before they take off. But with the satellite system, if the crew saw that it had the necessary three-mile separation from the previous takeoff, it could decide on its own to depart.
The new system has been tested in the Midwest. United Parcel Service, which is leading its development, believes it can be useful at its hub in Louisville. But the F.A.A., which has been working with the cargo carriers, has some reservations.
"What if the second pilot leaves before he has the three miles?" asked David W. Ford, the F.A.A. official in charge of developing such systems. "Who gets credited with the operational error?"
For now, the F.A.A. is working on deploying a series of discrete systems designed to improve the efficiency of takeoffs and landings at busy airports and to allow some airplanes to fly more direct routes. But these improvements will not come close to addressing the long-term growth in air traffic.
"We know we can make some changes," said Steven J. Brown, the F.A.A.'s acting associate administrator for air traffic services. "Those will be marginal -- not unimportant, but marginal."
 
The Criticism
Should the F.A.A.
Be Scuttled?
 Such talk fuels critics who say that the only way to end the gridlock in the skies is to junk the F.A.A. -- or junk the economics on which its management of the air traffic system is based.
Under the current arrangement, air traffic control services are paid for by taxes on airline tickets, cargo and fuel. Heavy users like commercial airlines do not pay any more to use the system than private pilots; small planes get the same priority as jumbo jets.
"The problem is that the resources are not priced properly," said Richard Golaszewski, a consultant who has advised the F.A.A. and several European countries. "In fact, they are not priced at all." That means that airlines have no incentive to limit their use of air traffic control services even at the most crowded airports.
For years, economists have urged the Government to switch to a fee-based system that would force users to pay for the services they use. Raising prices at peak hours would put pressure on airlines to reduce congestion. They might also switch service to underutilized secondary airports, or replace some regional jets with less frequent service on bigger planes.
"This is the unfinished business of deregulation," Mr. Golaszewski said. "We have taken off all of the controls on what airlines can do, but we haven't done anything to balance demand and capacity."
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Newark, LaGuardia and Kennedy airports, and the operators of San Francisco International Airport are considering changes that would discourage small planes, but both airport authorities fear the F.A.A. will block them.
Many advocates go farther and say that the air traffic control system needs to be separated from the F.A.A. and handed over to a new, independent entity that would operate like a business.
Various privatization proposals have been floated in Congress over the years, but none have made any progress. A plan that the Clinton administration sent to Capitol Hill in 1994 as part of Vice President Gore's campaign to reinvent government never got out of committee, even though the House was still controlled by Democrats at the time.
"I told him I'll do all I can to kill this idea," Representative James L. Oberstar, a Democrat from Minnesota who was then head of the House Transportation Committee's aviation subcommittee, recalled in a recent interview, referring to Mr. Gore.
Mr. Oberstar, now the ranking minority member on the committee, said that privatizing the F.A.A. would not break the aviation gridlock. "Who is to say that the private sector is going to do a better job than the public sector?" he said. "The same private sector that brings you delays?"
The F.A.A., he added, is already beginning to act more like a business. Congress passed legislation a few years ago creating a 15-member advisory council to supervise the agency. A bill passed this spring directed the council to hire a chief operating officer to run the air traffic control system.
Congress also increased the F.A.A.'s budget by $10 billion over the next three years to $40 billion over the next three years. And it required that funds collected from ticket taxes be spent only on aviation-related projects, such as expanding airports, rather than being used to finance other government programs.
" What we want to do is to give these things a chance and see if they won't make a difference," said Phil Boyer, president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, a longtime oppoinent of privatization whose 360,000 members make up more than half the licensed pilots in the country.
But critics say that the F.A.A. has been given too many chances already. Mr. Mead, the inspector general, said that Congress has been asking the F.A.A. since 1993 to assign a cost to each of the services its provides, as a prerequisite to charging user fees. Congress finally ordered that study in 1996; the F.A.A. now says it will be completed at the end of 2002.
Given the recent public outcry about flight delays, interest in privatization is on the rise again. Six years ago, when the Clinton administration floated its proposal, the concept was relatively new. Today, several countries, including Germany, Canada and New Zealand, have successfully contracted out air traffic services.
Nav Canada, the only private company in the world to run a national air traffic control system, has proven the most intriguing to policy makers in Washington. Before the nonprofit corporation was set up in 1996, the Canadian air traffic control system suffered many of the same problems that plague the F.A.A.: Its equipment was antiquated, and a proposed replacement was behind schedule and far over budget.
Since then, Nav Canada has managed to reduce air traffic delays, cut costs and revamp its technology. A cost-accounting system enables the company to charge users by the flight. Managers who worked under both systems say the new arrangement has enhanced safety, precisely because regulation and operations have been assigned to two different organizations. Airlines in the United States would like to be able to pay Nav Canada to control some domestic flights, but for now there is no mechanism for Nav Canada to accept such payments.
Some staff members on Capitol Hill have drafted a privatization proposal modeled on Nav Canada and are looking for a senator to sponsor it. Many analysts say the alternatives -- inching along with current plans or returning to tighter government regulation of air travel -- are unthinkable.
"My guess is that if we have one more summer as bad as this one, or even one worse than this one, finally it will force the issue," said John R. Meyer, a retired economics professor at Harvard who is in favor of introducing user fees. "That is the silver lining in every cloud."

Chart: "At Newark, Scheduling Pushes the Limits"
Under the best circumstances, airlines had scheduled Newark International Airport beyond its capacity for three hours in the afternoon of Aug. 25, a typically busy Friday. But because the airport was operating under bad-weather rules the entire day, it was over capacity for nine hours.
 
Charts show scheduled arrivals friday, August 25, 2000, and on-time departures for June.
 
Such overscheduling contributes to flight delays that accumulate as the day progresses. During June at Newark, only 31 percent of flights left on time by 11 p.m.

Chart: "Wanted: Air Efficiency"
CURRENT SYSTEM -- In the existing air traffic control system, based on ground-based radar, most pilots depend on controllers to guide them, single file and carefully spaced, along a limited number of clogged air corridors.
 
MINIMUM SPACING: -- 5 MILES HORIZONTALLY, 1,000 FT. VERTICALLY
 
ADDING IN SPACE -- In practice, controllers spread planes out more than the minimums allowed for an extra margin of safety. And at times of congestion, they add even more space to keep the number of planes manageable. During storms, some routes may close, with planes spaced out along remaining corridors.
 
7 TO 60 MILES OF SPACING
 
GIVING PILOTS CONTROL -- Cargo airlines are experimenting with a satellite and cockpit-based system in which planes signal their locations to each other. It could let pilots fly closer together at their discretion, greatly increasing the capacity of the air lanes.

HEADLINE: As Diplomacy Loses Luster, Stars Flee State Dept.

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 4

 BODY:
At 32, Mona Sutphen, smart, driven and possessed of that quality so elusive in Washington, an easy personality, was known as one of the best and the brightest in the West Wing of the White House.
As executive assistant to the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, she was trusted to work on the most sensitive foreign policy matters. She sat through the tough crises, including whether to bomb Iraq and how to rescue an American pilot downed in enemy Yugoslav territory. Had she wanted, Ms. Sutphen, who was on loan from the State Department, could have gone to the heights of the United States Foreign Service: political counselor at an embassy, assistant secretary of state or an ambassador. Perhaps even the top job one day. 
 But those peaks did not look so great to Ms. Sutphen.
Instead of returning to the State Department and a future of writing cables that she felt nobody important read, she took her passion for foreign affairs to an Internet company. She is a prime example of what policy experts say is a crippling problem at the State Department: talented diplomats are leaving for careers that they believe have more power and prestige in the new global economy. And college graduates who used to rush to take the Foreign Service exam no longer bother.
The State Department, the institution responsible for American diplomacy around the world, is finding it hard to adjust to an era in which financial markets pack more punch than a Washington-Moscow summit meeting. It is losing recruits to investment banks, dot-com companies and the Treasury and Commerce Departments, which have magnified their foreign policy roles. Some are turning to idealistic private organizations that work in risky environments abroad, a far cry from the days of the cold war, when the State Department was the only place to be.
When Ms. Sutphen prepared to leave the State Department this spring, the Foreign Service made her decision easier because, while it took great pride in her as a woman of African-American heritage, it offered her nothing that she found challenging.
"In the end there was nothing on the horizon that I really wanted," she said. After the hothouse of the National Security Council at the White House, and having served in Bosnia and Thailand, the "idea of being the third political officer on the Israeli desk is very difficult." Instead, she chose to join the Manhattan office of Currenex, a Silicon Valley Internet company that specializes in business-to-business foreign currency trading at a salary of more than $100,000 -- more than twice her government pay -- plus stock options.
The loss of prestige and power at the State Department has not gone unnoticed around Washington or inside the department itself. What to do about it has consumed study groups and consultants and caused hand-wringing among the top echelon of State Department officials.
In fact, the department was so worried about the problem that two years ago it commissioned a study from a consulting firm, McKinsey & Company. The results delivered to the department, with recommendations to be carried out this year, were not flattering.
Young diplomats told the consultants that they were frustrated by slow promotions of the bureaucracy compared with promotions based on merit in the private sector. They questioned the relevance of their work. "The best for what work?" parried one respondent.
They were dismissive of what they described as demoralized management. They complained that the department was unresponsive to the needs of two-career couples, especially when sending diplomats abroad.
The study, titled "The War for Talent" -- tellingly renamed "The War Against Talent" in the department's corridors -- quoted one diplomat as saying, "You've joined the supposedly elite Foreign Service and you have terrible managers -- people who've been promoted to get them out of other people's hair."
Outside the department, the United States Commission on National Security/21st Century, set up by the federal government to study the nation's needs for its national security architecture, has taken a particular interest in the State Department's failings. The commission's executive director, Gen. Charles G. Boyd, said he had been taken aback by the department's difficulty in "retaining and recruiting quality people."
At elite graduate schools specializing in international relations, deans say that the Foreign Service has slipped down the totem pole as a career choice.
Instead, smart graduates who want to join government are heading for the Departments of the Treasury or Commerce, said Mark L. von Hagen, director of the Harriman Institute at Columbia University. Others gravitate toward nongovernmental organizations and to the World Bank. "It reflects the generally diminished role of the State Department in foreign policy," Mr. von Hagen said.
The new director general of the Foreign Service at the State Department, Marc Grossman, in essence the department's chief personnel officer, acknowledged the problem when he appeared before the Commission on National Security recently.
The dropout rate for one of the five groups of diplomats who entered the State Department in 1992 or 1993 was 32 percent, he said. For another group in that period, the dropout rate was 23 percent, although it was only 12 percent for two other groups. From 1994 to 1997, the dropout rate has hovered around 20 percent.
Officials at the State Department's personnel department said they do not have statistics to compare this dropout rate with previous decades. Nor, they said, had the department done analysis to determine whether those who had left in the 1990's were considered the most talented.
One of the most senior officials at the State Department, Under Secretary of States Thomas R. Pickering, who has served for nearly 40 years and has been ambassador to eight countries, said he did not believe that the dropout rates differed "so wildly" from the past, particularly in the era of the Vietnam war when many dissenters quit.
But General Boyd said that anecdotal evidence suggested that good young diplomats had quit in the 1990's and that the dropout rate was higher than in the past. And for all those who are leaving, there are believed to be many who are more than qualified but are not considering the Foreign Service. Last year, said the under secretary for management, Bonnie R. Cohen, there was a "significant" drop in the number of candidates who, after passing the written and oral exams of the Foreign Service and the security checks, accepted an offer to join the department. "That means young people are looking elsewhere for other jobs," said Ms. Cohen, who is in charge of budgetary and personnel matters for the department.
Money -- in particular the large financial packages from merchant banks that also offer stimulating work in the global economy -- is proving an important, though not overriding, reason for officials to leave. The average starting salary for a new Foreign Service officer is $32,500, Ms. Cohen said. This is less than some unionized customer service agents make at the Verizon telephone company..
Peter E. Bass, 37 -- who after a meteoric career left the State Department this summer to join Goldman Sachs as the chief of staff for the bank's president and chief operating officer, John L. Thornton -- is one of half a dozen officials who have been enticed away in the last several years by Goldman Sachs.
"I hope to gain a knowledge of the financial world, the global economy and capital markets, which are the key for global prosperity," Mr. Bass said, explaining his decision to leave. He had been deputy assistant secretary of state for energy and sanctions, involved in policy toward Iran and Libya.
But the Wall Street scale salary was also a lure. "When the difference in money is arithmetic, it's bearable; when it's geometric, it becomes harder and harder," Mr. Bass said.
One reason that Mr. Grossman is appreciated as the new face of personnel, though, is that he acknowledges that money is not the only reason for losing good people. He knows, he said, that in order to attract and keep talent, the department must evolve.
"The department has to change from being one that went and observed to one that sees itself in a more active world," Mr. Grossman said. "I can't give more people more money but I can give jobs that are seen as more active and less passive."
But it may be a hard argument to win. Many of the fields that Mr. Grossman talks about being new to the State Department -- international trafficking in people, the environment, empowering poor women -- are often handled by other American agencies operating abroad.
The Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, for example, now operate at a number of American embassies. Rather than being proud of this expansion, American diplomats view these agencies as competitors for whom, they say, embassies perform the role of "concierge." At the American Embassy in London, for example, fewer than 20 percent of the officials belong to the State Department.
There are other hurdles: most notably, the archaic way the State Department hires people and treats them once they get inside. It can take up to two years before a candidate, who has taken the written exam (general knowledge, focusing on international affairs) and the oral exam (problem-solving) and passed the security clearance is invited to join the Foreign Service.
Diplomats who have recently left the State Department argue that the substance of the work must also change if good people are going to stay.
"You've got a culture where you are told to make notes and send them forward," said Spence Spencer, 38, who quit this summer after 12 years and three tours abroad. "A lot of it is staffing to make sure your boss looks good."
Mr. Spencer, who celebrated his departure over several glasses of wine at a recent lunch, left on a high note. He reached a cherished goal: equipping 30 court buildings in Kosovo with computers, fax machines, photo copiers, typewriters, generators and metal detectors.
An official in the department's Human Rights Bureau, Mr. Spencer said there was much more in the field of human rights that he would like to do at the State Department but felt he would be unable to achieve.
"There is such disdain for the community of nongovernment organizations at the State Department," said Mr. Spencer, whose passion is elections, police, justice and the other "soft" issues that crop up in regions of conflict.
"At State, you can't talk to these organizations with ease," he said. "So you are left talking to each other." Mr. Spencer is joining Public Strategies Inc., a company based in Austin, Tex. He will specialize in public affairs for European companies exporting to the United States and plans to do pro bono work for international nongovernmental organizations.
Another diplomat, Cynthia R. Bunton, 46, who dreamed of joining the State Department from age 12, speaks four languages and has served in a number of posts abroad. Now that she is back in Washington, the department is unable to find a way to use her new expertise in intellectual property rights, an increasingly vital issue for American business.
As the consul in Naples, Italy, for political and commercial affairs, she became an expert in property rights and for the past year has been on loan to the Recording Industry Association of America in Washington.
Ms. Bunton said she realized the importance of economics in diplomacy several years ago and decided to concentrate on music piracy. "The question is: do I go backward and become a political officer again -- which I have been all my life -- or go out into private industry?" she said. She still feels loyalty to the State Department, but she is leaning, she said, toward leaving.
One of those on the United States Commission on National Security, Leslie H. Gelb, said that in order to keep people like Ms. Sutphen, Mr. Bass, Mr. Spencer and Ms. Bunton, the State Department must make fundamental changes to regain the prestige of the past.
"The State Department will be able to attract anyone it wants when once again the building becomes the center of making foreign policy and foreign policy strategy," said Mr. Gelb, who is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
"Good people want to work at places that are at the center of things."

HEADLINE: Inmates Battling West's Fires Help States and Themselves

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: YELLOW PINE, Idaho, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Back in Utah, they are inmates at Bluffdale State Prison. But out here in the fire zone, they strut proudly in black T-shirts proclaiming themselves members of the Flame 'N' Go Hotshots.
"Being in this program makes all the difference," Bart Clark, 33, a six-time felon who has spent 11 of the last 15 years in prison, said this morning before shouldering his backpack on a hill acrid with smoke. 
 "Now I can tell my 4-year-old son that his dad isn't in prison, he's out fighting fires."
Almost every day since mid-May, Mr. Clark -- convicted most recently of kidnapping -- and the rest of his 20-man crew have been outside the wire, battling blazes across the West. The Utah program began in 1985, and as inmate-firefighters this year, the crew is far from alone.
In this devastating fire season, one in six of the crew members fighting fires by hand is a convict, drawn from state prisons in an enterprise that most everyone involved seems to see as benefiting all concerned.
"Sometimes there are special considerations, on account of their being inmates," said Mike Melton, a Forest Service official in command of the firefighting effort about 20 miles from this tiny town, deep in the mountains of central Idaho. "But frankly, we're glad to have any help we can get."
Other federal officials say the inmates have been invaluable, providing a much needed, well-trained and well-supervised reinforcement to resources that have worn thin.
At wages that average $1 an hour, the use of inmates is a bargain, one that might ease the taxpayers' burden in a year in which federal firefighting costs will exceed $1 billion.
And in conversations here in Idaho and in their Utah prison home, these inmates also described themselves as blessed, seeing fire as a vehicle that has brought not only a taste of freedom but an opportunity to redress old wrongs.
"Most of my life, I took things from other people, and now it's time to give something back," Tommy Phong, 33, said, puffing a cigarette in the early morning chill as he and the crew prepared to head out. After more than 13 years in prison, Mr. Phong, who was convicted of armed robbery, is scheduled to be paroled early next year, and he said he hoped his three summers fighting fires would prepare him for life outside of prison.
"All that time you're in prison, what's on your mind is to get out on the street," Mr. Phong said. "And from my first years as a firefighter, I've seen what it is like."
As the inmates loaded their gear, they were only one hub in a swirl of activity at the fire camp, home to forest rangers, college students, paramedics and skiers apparently unfazed by having prisoners in their midst.
"With some of the inmate crews, we get an extra security briefing, and the women are supposed to walk around in pairs," said John Cataldo, 28, a ranger in Alaska's Denali National Park who is on temporary fire duty in Idaho. "But everyone treats the Flame 'N' Goes like a regular hotshot crew."
The Utah team is the only crew of inmates to hold a federal designation as "hotshots," slang for top-ranking Type I status. They wear the T-shirts, not the orange prison jumpsuits assigned to inmates from California and some other states and -- under state policy -- are accompanied by unarmed escorts from Utah's Department of Corrections, not the gun-carrying guards common to some other inmate camps.
With wages that can reach $5.55 an hour, the Utah crew is better paid than other inmate teams, though the rate is just a fraction of civilian wages. A civilian firefighter with the same elite status would make about $15 an hour plus overtime.
But in all the heady rush, the prisoners have also been given a sobering reminder that firefighting is not without risk. Two fellow inmate-firefighters were killed last week in Utah in a lightning strike, raising questions about just how much value might be attached to an inmate's life.
The State of Utah has paid only for the inmates' funerals, and state officials say they cannot be confident that the two prisoners will become eligible for federal death benefits of nearly $150,000 that is routinely paid to firefighters slain in action.
"When we signed up, we had to sign a waiver that released the state from any liability," Michael Kinikini, 33, a member of that team and a convicted robber, said at the Utah prison this week. "But the bottom line is that we're out there protecting public land, and if we die, the compensation should be the same as for everyone else."
Of the two men killed, Michael Bishop, 27, had spent seven years in prison for attempted murder, while Roger Braithwaite, 26, had spent three years behind bars after a conviction for vehicular homicide. Both were within 36 months of their scheduled parole dates, a prerequisite for consideration in the Utah crew, and both had been moved to minimum-security quarters, another requirement.
"I wasn't too proud of him when he first went in to prison," Dan Bishop of Riverton, Utah, said of his late son. "But I became very, very proud."
By official count, some 25,000 firefighters are now involved in battling dozens of blazes across the West.
That count includes ground crews, air squads, fire engine personnel, and an army of supervisors and support personnel, said Neil Hitchcock, a federal fire manager who coordinates the use of firefighting resources.
About 13,000 people belong to crews assigned to the fire lines, Mr. Hitchcock said. Of these, more than 2,000 are inmates, according to estimates provided by regional fire centers, with most operating in California, home to the nation's largest inmate-firefighter program.
With an overall force of 60, divided among three 20-person crews, the Utah prison-firefighting program is one of the smallest in the West.
In addition to California's, which is spread across 38 conservation camps, another large program exists in Nevada and numbers about 900 inmates. Wyoming, Idaho, and, most recently, Texas are among the states that have established smaller operations.
In no state are the inmates compelled to serve as firefighters, state officials said.
The Utah program stands out in part because its inmate-firefighters are routinely permitted to travel outside the state, so that its teams have been in the lead this summer in battling some of the nation's largest fires.
But still, federal officials say that the contributions by other programs have also been felt widely, because the widespread use of inmates on fires in California, for example, has freed civilian crews to focus on blazes in Idaho and Montana, the states that have been hardest hit this summer.
In every state, the inmates are led by state forestry officials who guide them in firefighting techniques and relay directions from fire commanders. And though the rules imposed on inmates vary from state to state, a common denominator is a ban on participation by sex offenders or suspected escape risks. There have been no reported escape attempts or other incidents of misconduct involving inmates in the firefighting this year.
"They don't want anybody with any rabbit in them," said another inmate, Bryan Kawa, 32, of South Ogden, Utah, who was convicted on a weapons charge. Mr. Kawa, like other prisoners, is housed in a minimum-security dormitory, 30 men to a room, when he is not on the fire lines.
Among the advocates of prison-firefighting programs are those who argue that they make good economic sense.
In California, where the state prison population now stands at 162,000, it costs $21,000 a year to house a prisoner behind walls but just $13,000 a year at one of the conservation camps, said Mack Reynolds, a corrections official who supervises that state's program.
In California and some other states, the incentives offered for prisoner participation include early release, with a one-day credit in time served typically offered for every day that an inmate works on the fire line. In Utah, however, sentences are fixed, which state officials say is a reason that they provide more pay.
Some prisoner-rights advocates, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, have campaigned for broad changes in the law that would require that inmates be paid at least minimum wage and be made subject to other labor-protection laws.
In an interview, Carol Gnade, the group's executive director in Utah, said she had mixed feelings about the program.
"On the one hand, we encourage prisons to get more involved in giving opportunity to prisoners," Ms. Gnade said. "But at the same time, they should extend that to the same kinds of protections that other people receive."
The Utah inmates and their escorts described compensation as just one reward. "We get up on top of mountains where no one else has ever been," said Mr. Kawa, who is scheduled to be released in January after 11 years in prison.
"It's a zoo in there, and it's ugly," Ben Van Zandt, 35, a corrections officer, said of Bluffdale prison, home to 5,000 inmates. "A lot of these guys have spent many years in that zoo. And what this program does is to help them move from the zoo to the outside world."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
A Russian Dinosaur

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
The sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk was a tragic but incredibly illuminating example of the transition the world, and Russia, are now going through from the cold-war system to the globalization system. Unfortunately, there's always some guy down the line who hasn't gotten the word yet. In this case it was Russia's president, Vladimir Putin.
Yo, Putin, this ain't your father's Soviet Union anymore. 
 In an interview on Russian TV following the Kursk tragedy, Mr. Putin defended his government and laid out his priorities: "I will be with the army. I will be with the fleet. I will be with the people." As Time magazine's Paul Quinn-Judge noted in a commentary from Moscow, Mr. Putin still believes that "the needs of the state always come first; individual concerns come a distant second."
Not in this era. What happens when a country like Russia plugs into globalization -- into global free markets, telecommunications, media and the Internet -- is that individuals become empowered, even super-empowered. That is, their ability to gather information themselves, earn a living and assert their will directly -- as individuals -- greatly increases thanks to globalization and the falling of walls everywhere. Moreover, when everyone starts to know how everyone else in the world is living, which also happens in globalization, individuals start to demand the same things. And they get angry when their leaders don't deliver.
The Kursk incident showed just how much the Russian people are starting to get this, and how little Mr. Putin does. Why did Mr. Putin and his generals resist asking for foreign help until it was too late? Because they feared it would sully the honor of Mother Russia's army and puncture Russia's pretense to still being a superpower. But the families of the Russian sailors, who knew foreign help was available, told them: "I don't want to hear about Mother Russia, or Father Russia. I want Yuri, Boris and Oleg off the ocean floor."
The message those parents sent to Russia's leaders was that "until further notice, you better have a good reason to risk a Russian soldier's life," remarked the Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi, whose book, "Rubber Bullets," documents how Israel went through a similar transformation. "They sent a message that while national honor still matters, individual life and individual aspirations now matter too. They are now viable competitors with national honor -- and may matter even more. So it's not only Americans who don't want to die for abstractions anymore. It's also Russians."
Indeed, the Russian newspaper Izvestia ran a front-page picture of the crew of the Kursk, under a remarkable headline: "The Price of National Pride -- Human Lives." Such a headline, with such an equation, would have been unthinkable in the cold war, but it is utterly normal in globalization.
Sure, Mr. Putin can still send Russian soldiers to die in Chechnya, because many Russians still perceive that as a war of no choice against a real internal threat. But with the collapse of the cold-war system, they do not perceive an external threat. Indeed, most Russians would like to emulate America today, not bury it. And vice versa. Americans also prayed for the Kursk to be saved. Because without the cold-war psychological framework, the Kursk disaster was not seen as an enemy loss. It was seen as a human loss.
Does this mean that Russia will now have to fold its army and navy? Of course not. Russian nationalism and national security interests haven't gone away. But they now have a viable competitor in shaping Russian decision-making: the aspiration of individual Russians for personal security and personal fulfillment -- which today's globalization system encourages, by giving more Russians the information, connections, power and incentives to act on their own for their own betterment.
So everything is still possible with Russia. It's still possible that an autocratic Russian leader will try to restore Russian military power and provoke a war with the U.S. Yes, that is still possible. But in today's era of globalization it is much less sustainable. Because Russians will not automatically put up with pain and sacrifice anymore just to preserve some national symbols. Not in this world. That was the Kursk's crew's last message -- a message Russian leaders ignore at their peril.

HEADLINE: Online Deliveries Lighten Burden for the Disabled;
Empowerment, Not Just Convenience, For an Unexpected Class of Consumer

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Mary West stumbled across YourGrocer.com, an online grocery store, one afternoon a few years ago and quickly became a fan of its fresh blueberry muffins and fast deliveries.
Ordering her groceries by computer made Ms. West like any other shopper, and for this she was grateful. Now, Ms. West, who is blind, does not stand out the way she once did in D'Agostino's or Gristede's. 
 "I was looking for a place to do a lot of my shopping," said Ms. West, 35, "because I am visually impaired and I can't read labels and things on the grocery shelves." In the past, she had to rely on the help of store clerks and friends to shop for groceries and perform other tasks.
Before she had access to online delivery services, shopping had become so difficult that she had given up, ordering her favorite, although much less healthful, takeout instead.
"It really helps me out because I have a bad back, bad knees, diabetes and I can't really go the supermarket anymore," said Ms. West, who lives in Chelsea. "Four or five years ago I was not able to cook my own food because I did not have any, so I was ordering out, and that was not helping my health or my pocketbook."
Now she uses special voice recognition software to surf the Web for everything from dishwashing detergent to vegetables.
People like Ms. West, who have a temporary or permanent disability that makes it difficult to handle everyday chores on their own, are increasingly using online delivery services to rent movies, pick up cleaning supplies and buy groceries.
The advantages of information technology are pronounced in places like Manhattan, advocates for the disabled say, because crowded streets, the lack of access for the handicapped to cabs and subway stations, and other factors complicate their lives.
To the disabled, the growth of online delivery services has been empowering. To their advocates, it represents progress. To some owners of such businesses, it has become another piece of a shrewd business equation. Noble as it may be to help the disabled like rent a movie from Blockbuster or buy fresh vegetables on their own, to J. Maxwell Enoch, the chief executive of YourGrocer. com, it is about capitalizing on a market his company's founders did not even envision.
"Undoubtedly, the sort of people we are talking about have found a way to our service," Mr. Enoch said, "and it is very meaningful to them."
People with permanent disabilities, like Ms. West, and those who are temporarily off their feet, like women recovering after childbirth and runners with sprained knees, have created a new marketing niche for Mr. Enoch's company, which is based in Eastchester, N.Y., and serves New York City and some of its suburbs.
"In Manhattan, you are held hostage by the D'Agostinos and the Gristedes of the world," Mr. Enoch said in a recent interview. He noted that those grocery stores are often busy and cannot provide much attention to a disabled customer. Even when the handicapped are able to navigate these stores, he added, they often have difficulty getting the items back home. "A lot of the things we carry are heavy," Mr. Enoch said, and for the disabled, the benefits of delivery are magnified.
Executives of similar online delivery services said they were not necessarily trying to attract disabled customers when they started operating. Most of the businesses, based in Manhattan's Silicon Alley, focused on reaching young urban professionals, appealing to a simple desire for convenience.
"We go where the customers lead us," said Skip Trevathan, the chief operating officer at Kozmo.com, which is based in Manhattan and delivers many items, including toilet paper and movies, in cities across the country. "It obviously was in the thinking behind the business model, but only in a narrow sense of people who were homebound for a few days because of something like pregnancy or an injury."
That vision has expanded, Mr. Trevathan added. Now, the first page of Kozmo's employee training manual includes a letter from a disabled customer, Cameo C. Massey. Ms. Massey, a single mother in Seattle who suffers from Epstein-Barr syndrome and has severe nerve damage from troublesome surgeries, wrote about her difficulties doing everyday chores.
"I find myself at the mercy of my own limitations," Ms. Massey wrote. "Your service has helped make my life filled with more quality time. By being able to order books, magazines, movies, games and food from Kozmo, I find that I am able to feel more in touch and up to date with normal people."
Many disabled New Yorkers echo those sentiments. Ms. West, who teaches at the Computer Center for the Visually Impaired People at Baruch College, said that for the first time in her life, she "can handle everything like a sighted person."
Kozmo.com officials said they believed that as more disabled Americans gain access to computers, they would increasingly rely on online delivery services. A recent Harris poll conducted for the National Organization on Disability and financed by Aetna U.S. Healthcare found that adults with disabilities were twice as likely as the nondisabled to report that the Internet had significantly improved their lives. But the poll also found that only 43 percent of the disabled respondents had access to the Internet, compared with 57 percent of the nondisabled respondents.
For its part, Kozmo.com has begun a campaign with the National Cristina Foundation, a nonprofit organization that brings computer technology to the disabled, to deliver donated computers to the doorsteps of disabled Americans.
In a partnership with General Motors, Kmart and Microsoft, Heidi Van Arnem, a Birmingham, Mich., entrepreneur who has been a quadriplegic since 16, began a national campaign this year, the 10th anniversary of the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, to draw attention to what she calls the "disability divide."
In a speech she gave when the campaign started, Ms. Van Arnem, the chief executive of I-Can Online, which provides consultant services to commercial Web sites trying to reach the disabled, said, "Disabilities disappear with advancements in technology." But the fact that the people who benefit most are the ones most likely not to have a computer is frustrating, she said.
She added that the online companies beginning to cater to the disabled "represent a growing awareness that there is great opportunity to reach the 85 percent of people with disabilities who are not online yet, and whose lives stand to be enhanced by connecting to the Internet."
Robert Harvey, the president of I-Can Online, said in a recent interview that the disabled population is "the most underserved and underattended market in the country" because the disabled "are just not in public view. But they spend a trillion dollars a year on our economy."
Fifty-four million Americans, about 20 percent of the population, have disabilities, according to the latest Census Bureau data. There are about 5.6 million disabled people in New York City and its suburbs.
Most online delivery companies, Mr. Harvey said, began with a "throw seeds out and watch to see if anything will sprout" approach and quickly found that the disabled could become one of their most solid customer bases. Their success has caused other businesses to "think about this population and how they want to reach them," he said.
Despite the advantages that the Internet offers to the disabled, technological problems persist. For example, the National Federation of the Blind has sued America Online, claiming that AOL violates the Americans With Disabilities Act because its software is incompatible with many voice recognition programs, known as assisted technology. The suit is pending.
And advocacy groups have begun lobbying for an amendment to the Americans With Disabilities Act that would require online companies to give the handicapped access to the Internet, given the importance the medium has become in commerce and communication.
Several companies, including YourGrocer.com, UrbanFetch.com and Amazon.com, have had to deal with similar technical issues. Even I-Can Online had problems, since corrected, that made it difficult for voice recognition software to read its Web pages. The software allows users to control their computers with their voices instead of keyboards. The computer also reads text from Web pages, if they are formatted properly.
"It did not take us long to realize that we could not be the advocates for people with disabilities and not have ramps for our own people," said Mr. Harvey, the president of I-Can. "One of the elements we now put in our contracts is that the companies will work to make their sites more accessible."
Many online delivery companies have found, Mr. Harvey said, that improvements that make it easier for the disabled to use their sites can also appeal to nondisabled customers. For example, voice recognition software compatibility could be helpful to someone trying to shop on the Web while driving a car.
The challenges notwithstanding, Ms. West sees the improvements for disabled people as a monumental and empowering turning point. "It evens the playing field," she said.

Spurned Networks Express No Interest in Rival Debates
The ABC and CBS television networks, which were left out of Gov. George W. Bush's presidential debates proposal, said they had no intention of carrying debates sponsored by rival networks like NBC and CNN. The Bush proposal, announced on Sunday after negotiations with officials of six cable and broadcast networks, has thrown into turmoil the work of the Commission on Presidential Debates, the panel created in 1987 by Democrats and Republicans to avoid squabbling over debates. Since the creation of the panel, no candidate has gone so far to circumvent its work. The panel's executive director said she still hoped to negotiate an agreement under which Mr. Bush would consent to the commission's schedule. A1

HEADLINE: Contest for Albany Seat Hinges on a Veteran Legislator's Relevance

SERIES: NEW YORK PRIMARY: 141st Assembly District

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Sept. 3

 BODY:
By noon, Assemblyman Arthur O. Eve had already put in a full morning of campaigning and seemed more than a bit weary. He had spent hours today shaking the hands of supporters and had just completed a caravan through the humid streets of Buffalo with a dozen cars carrying loudspeakers imploring people along the way to vote for him.
Mr. Eve, 67, a veteran of Buffalo politics, the deputy speaker of the State Assembly and the longest serving member of that legislative body, is now fully immersed in the fight of his political life. After more than three decades of a political career that began when Lyndon B. Johnson was president and Nelson A. Rockefeller was governor, Mr. Eve has had to campaign with an intensity that, by his own admission, he has never had to employ before. 
 In a three-way race in the Sept. 12 Democratic primary, Mr. Eve's major challenger is Crystal D. Peoples, 48, the majority leader of the Erie County Legislature. Ms. Peoples has defied expectations in earlier races by winning as the consummate outsider backed by a strong grass-roots group of supporters. In her campaign, Ms. Peoples acknowledges with admiration Mr. Eve's years of public service, but she insists that his methods are outdated and that he has become ineffective.
The themes being evoked against Mr. Eve in his 18th campaign reflect a trend that is dominating several of the races in the state in this year's primary season. Several black incumbents, like Mr. Eve, who came of political age during the civil rights movement are now facing vigorous challenges from insurgents who are depicting these political stalwarts as tired legislators with an antiquated approach to governing.
The technique is not only a hallmark of the campaign against Mr. Eve here along the streets of Buffalo's largely black East Side. It is also being used with great fanfare in primary races in New York City, against such longtime members of Congress as Major R. Owens and Edolphus Towns of Brooklyn and against others in Assembly races.
"In different parts of the country, there are incumbents who came to power in the early wave of majority black districts who have not faced serious competition for a long period of time," said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Urban Research Center at the City University of New York's Graduate Center.
"And they are therefore in varying degrees of contact with their base," Mr. Mollenkopf said. "And that makes them vulnerable to challenges to somebody who decides that what was great for the civil rights era is not appropriate for today."
The evidence that Mr. Eve is taking this race seriously is abundant. He has summoned several elected officials here to campaign on his behalf, including State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, United States Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Representative Maxine Waters of California.
In addition, Mr. Eve's son Eric, who ran Vice President Al Gore's primary campaign in New York State, is now helping his father's re-election effort.
In one appearance before voters after another, Arthur Eve says that his years in office have produced landmark legislation, effective programs sponsored by the state and millions of dollars for community organizations throughout the 141st Assembly District which he represents.
He takes particular pride, for example, in his role in establishing the Educational Opportunity Program, which helps economically disadvantaged students attend the State University of New York, and in sponsoring bills that require affirmative action on state-financed projects.
"We've been able to put a lot of institutions in this community over 34 years," Mr. Eve said today, sitting in a campaign office buzzing with volunteers. "We have been instrumental in bringing in money for housing. We have developed training programs, educational programs and many other programs. I've tried to create institutions that will last long after Arthur Eve is gone from the scene."
He points out that with the reapportionment of legislative districts within a year or two, western New York is likely to lose at least one Assembly seat because of declining population. He says his seniority will ensure that this largely black corner of the region will be remembered by legislators who carve districts based in part on incumbents' length of service.
But Ms. Peoples says that none of those programs nor the pipeline of state money has made a difference on the East Side of Buffalo. She points to the once-thriving commercial district along Jefferson Avenue, where there are now as many shuttered businesses as open ones. She points out that there is but one supermarket in the entire district of 120,000 residents and that the streets are in dire need of repairs and the schools in need of upgrading.
"I give him all due respect for his length of service and the sacrifices he has made," she said. "But that doesn't automatically make him the elected official to stay in power for life. I'm also running because the social agenda of the 60's is old and should be over with. We have to focus on economic issues now."
She added that the conditions in the 141st District present the most salient argument for Mr. Eve's retirement. "If our community were booming, if everyone was doing well and if our streets and schools were in good shape, then you could make an argument for keeping him in office," she said. "But that's not what's happening here."
Ms. Peoples has emerged as a formidable candidate, in part because of her involvement with the political organization called Grassroots. The organization has made a name for itself because of its success at registering thousands of voters and placing several of its members in elected office, notably Ms. Peoples and Byron W. Brown, a member of the Buffalo Common Council who is now challenging a state senator, Alfred T. Coppola.
Ms. Peoples, a former elementary schoolteacher who has served on the County Legislature for five years, has been a relentless campaigner. She has walked the streets of the district night and day, from senior centers and public housing complexes to Gigi's, a soul food restaurant, where she greeted people over their morning grits and eggs. She wears a T-shirt bearing her name on the front and the slogan "Keeping It Real" on the back. She has raised about $40,000 for the campaign, she said, and has an army of volunteers.
Mr. Eve has put together his own battalion of campaign troops, some from outside Buffalo, and has raised about $60,000. His campaign officials have studied the races of other longtime incumbents under attack by younger challengers, like Mr. Rangel's 1996 race against Adam Clayton Powell IV.
The competitiveness of the campaign has led him not only to defend his record, but also to undertake a vigorous campaign schedule, like that of Ms. Peoples.
"She has name recognition because she is a public official," Mr. Eve said on a recent morning. "And so I have to campaign in a way that enables me to get my message out. This is the greatest challenge I have ever had."
The candidates' campaign commercials seem to be broadcast incessantly on some of Buffalo's radio stations. Campaign posters are on storefront windows, lawns and buildings throughout the district.
The prominence of those signs is symbolic of how divisive this race has been in Buffalo, particularly in the city's black neighborhoods. (The third candidate in the primary is Samuel A. Herbert.)
Some, like Mr. Brown, the Common Council member and State Senate candidate, say they appreciate the work Mr. Eve has done over the years, but find Ms. Peoples's message far more captivating. "She is articulate, charismatic, and makes a good point," said Mr. Brown, who was once an aide to Mr. Eve. "I feel it's time for a change."
Others, like Beverly A. Gray, another Common Council member, say they are disturbed to see that a man who has achieved such seniority and has been such a symbol of black political power in western New York has been forced into a highly competitive primary.
"Many of us are appalled at this," Ms. Gray said. "Arthur Eve has a history of creating great educational programs. He has dedicated himself to this community. And this primary is terrible because it has divided our community."
Mr. Eve, who left segregated Miami to work in a Chevrolet assembly plant in Buffalo before entering politics, says he wants to continue in office because "this city has been so good to me, and I want to continue giving back to this community."
The characterizations of him as an ineffective relic from another era, Mr. Eve said, "used to bother me, especially because they came from people who were helped by the very educational programs that I helped to create."
Speaking slowly, with a hint of melancholy, Mr. Eve said, "That used to bother me, but it doesn't anymore. I just tell myself that it's just politics."

Unspectacular, but Advancing

BYLINE: By Sophia Hollander 

 BODY:
After Todd Martin managed to conclude his rain-suspended match against 10th-seeded Cedric Pioline yesterday, he was asked at his news conference about unforced errors in his 7-6 (5), 6-3, 6-2 victory.
"I don't know the one you're referring to," said Martin, who advanced to the fourth round. 
 "I can't remember," the reporter admitted.
Martin understood. "We're both getting old," he said.
It's true. Martin's gray-flecked hair often makes him appear older than his 30 years, and his smooth but unspectacular game can make him seem like a grandfather on the court, creaky and old fashioned.
Martin knows that some fans find his style of play stuffy, in contrast to someone like, say, Pete Sampras.
"Pete plays a lot of his tennis the same why I do, but then there's another side of his tennis that's leaping and bounding and running and slapping and these things which, if I wanted to do that, I could," Martin said. "I'd be unemployed, but I could do that."
For now, Martin will stick with his solid serves and smart shot placement, and continue clocking in for at least another round. It is becoming a familiar routine for the No. 32-ranked Martin, who last year advanced to the Open final before falling to Andre Agassi.
Now, coming to the end of a shaky season in which he fell in the first round of the French Open and lost in the second round of Wimbledon and the Australian Open, Martin is seeking to regain his balance.
So far it seems to be working.
"I feel like I'm playing better than I did last year," he said. "I'm optimistic that I can do well if my game sustains as it is." Sophia Hollander

HEADLINE: Long Hours, More Pay

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In his Sept. 4 column, Bob Herbert correctly reports that the last few years have witnessed a significant rise in the inflation-adjusted wages of nearly all Americans. Mr. Herbert then laments the fact that the amount of time today's workers spend working has also risen. 
 Why the lament? When wages are higher, even workers who choose not to work longer hours take home more pay. Most workers who do work longer hours do so voluntarily, drawn by the ability to earn more for each extra hour worked, not because economic necessity drives them to work longer.

A Soft Landing With More Growth Than Usual

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
As the summer ends, the corporate earnings outlook is being undermined by signs that the economy is slowing. And some stock market analysts are warning that while profit growth will remain strong, the current projections for the last quarter of this year and the first of next year are too optimistic.
The employment data released on Friday reinforced the belief that the economy was cooling after six rate increases by the Federal Reserve. In August, nonfarm payroll jobs, excluding census workers and strikers, rose just 140,000, well below the 222,000 average for the first seven months of the year. Manufacturing jobs actually declined, and manufacturing activity shrank after 18 months of growth, according to a purchasing managers' index. The big automakers are cutting production. Home appliance manufacturers, like Whirlpool, say slowing demand will cut into their profits the rest of the year. Department stores, already beleaguered, are warning of a weak end to the year. 
 Furthermore, surges in the prices of crude oil and home heating oil for this winter will cut into consumers' ability to spend. Crude oil is now $33.83 a barrel, near a 10-year high and up 32.1 percent since the end of last year. Home heating oil is also near a 10-year high, at 97.97 cents a gallon, and already 41.2 percent above the average price of last fall and winter.
While these factors suggest slower economic growth, the good news is that a slowdown does not have to be as sharp as in the past to be successful in curbing inflation. Put another way, the soft landing that the Federal Reserve desires can come at a higher growth rate than in the past.
This means that the economy could be growing at a pretty brisk pace of 3.5 percent or 4 percent when the soft landing arrives and that the Fed could be finished with interest rate increases.
"That's a fair point," said Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at Banc America Securities. "The economy may not slow down that much." Even though he has one of the more bearish earnings forecasts, he still thinks the weakest quarters for corporate profits in the near future will be a 7.5 percent increase in operating earnings in the fourth quarter of this year and no increase in the first quarter of 2001. Then he expects earnings to begin growing again, with an 8 percent jump in the second quarter of next year and a 10 percent rise in the third quarter.
According to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks corporate earnings, the consensus among Wall Street analysts is that third-quarter operating earnings, which exclude one-time charges and other nonrecurring items, will be 17.3 percent higher than a year earlier for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. While that estimate has been trimmed from the 18.1 percent forecast in April, it is still very strong. For the fourth quarter, the growth forecast is 15.8 percent. The expectations of 17 percent and 15 percent gains follow a very strong first half, in which earnings surged 23.6 percent in the first quarter and 21.6 percent in the second quarter.
One reason an economic slowdown has not showed up strongly in the numbers collected by First Call/ Thomson Financial is that it has been offset in part by the surging expectations for companies in the oil industry.
The earnings prospects for the energy sector, including companies like Exxon Mobil and Texaco, have more than doubled with the rise in oil prices. Earnings are now expected to surge 77 percent in the third quarter, up from a 29 percent growth expectation in April and 62 percent in July. Excluding the energy sector, the earnings growth forecast for the S.& P. 500 would be 14.7 percent, instead of 17.3 percent, Mr. Hill said.
But after breaking down the averages, there are signs that Wall Street analysts are beginning to factor in an economic slowdown. For consumer cyclical companies, including Caterpillar, Dow Chemical and International Paper, analysts have reduced their earnings growth estimates to 6 percent for the third quarter, from 14 percent on April 1 and 12 percent on July 1.
Earnings estimates for companies making consumer staples, including General Mills and Kellogg, are also falling. The current forecast is for growth of 7 percent in the third quarter, down from 15 percent in April and 12 percent in July.
Another drag on earnings, though it is difficult to calculate, is the impact on the Ford Motor Company from the tire recall by Firestone. Because Ford recently went through a recapitalization, measuring the decline in earnings estimates cannot be easily done, said Chuck Hill, the director of research at First Call. "Clearly, analysts are lowering estimates," he noted, "because Ford is cutting back production because of the Firestone issue."
Technology earnings estimates have held up, despite warnings of a weak second half from several companies, including Lucent Technologies, Xerox and Unisys. The current forecast is for growth of 35 percent in the third quarter, compared with expectations of 33 percent in April and 36 percent in July. Generally, as the quarter approaches, analysts trim their estimates as they get more information from companies.
The suggestion that the economy need slow only modestly to curb inflationary pressures is a result of the surprising increase in worker productivity over the last couple of years. Because productivity has grown, the potential noninflationary growth rate of the economy has risen, a fact that has been acknowledged by Federal Reserve policy makers.
When productivity gains were running at 1.5 percent to 2 percent, the noninflationary growth rate of the economy was thought to be 2.5 percent to 3 percent. The total allowed for about a percentage point from the normal annual growth in the country's labor supply. So to get a soft landing, economic growth would have to be slowed to about 2.5 percent, or less, to take the pressure off wages and prices.
Now, Federal Reserve officials seem to agree that the noninflationary growth rate for the economy is as high as 4.5 percent because the trend line for worker productivity is approaching 3.5 percent. And Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, indicated that he was confident that the economy could continue growing at a high, noninflationary pace when he said in August that it was "still difficult to find credible evidence in the United States that the rate of structural productivity growth has stopped increasing."
James E. Glassman, the senior United States economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, sees beauty in a modest slowdown. "Corporate earnings don't have to slow down so much," he said, "if achieving a soft landing today means slowing growth to 4 percent instead of 2.5 percent."

Concerns Over Intel's Growth Help Send Nasdaq Lower

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Technology stocks fell broadly yesterday, sending the Nasdaq composite index lower. Intel led the decline after an analyst said that its sales growth would be slower than forecast.
Weakness in drug stocks, meanwhile, coupled with the slide in technology shares, dragged down the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. But the Dow Jones industrial average posted a gain, despite the weakness in Intel. 
 The first day after Labor Day is often seen as a time when America gets back to business. But traders and analysts were reluctant to attribute much significance to yesterday's price action.
"Given the strong gains Nasdaq recorded in August, when it was up 11 percent, the index was clearly vulnerable to profit taking," said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore.
The Nasdaq fell 91.15 points, or 2.2 percent, to 4,143.18. Declines in Intel, Cisco Systems and JDS Uniphase accounted for more than one-third of the Nasdaq price drop.
The S.& P. 500 index slumped 13.69 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,507.08.
But the Dow industrials rose 21.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,260.61, helped by a bullish forecast from Coca-Cola and gains in stocks like Home Depot and Proctor & Gamble.
Intel was the most active stock. The shares fell $4.69, to $69.25, after Ashok Kumar, an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, cut his ratings on the stock to "buy" from "strong buy."
The forecast for sluggish Intel sales brought down shares of other semiconductor manufacturers.
Xilinx fell $2.81, to $89.06. And Applied Materials fell 38 cents, to $84.44.
Analysts were reluctant to write off Intel, despite the downgrade.
"Absolute fortunes have been lost trying to market-time Intel," said Philip S. Dow, a managing director in equity research at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. "This is a buy-and-hold stock until you know the world is coming to an end."
WorldCom fell $3.19, to $33.75. The company, a long-distance phone service provider, agreed to buy Intermedia Communications for about $3 billion in stock and will assume $3 billion in debt to gain a controlling stake in Digex Inc., which helps to operate Web sites.
Drug stocks fell after an analyst at Banc of America Securities recommended that investors pare holdings in pharmaceutical companies.
Merck slipped $1.13, to $68.06; Pfizer fell $2.16, to $41; Eli Lilly declined $2.94, to $69.75; and Pharmacia closed at $56.44, down $1.94.
Coca-Cola had its biggest one-day gain since June 22, rising $1.75, to $56. The company said sales should rise 5 percent to 6 percent this year and as much as 7 percent in 2001.
Ciena was another drag on the Nasdaq yesterday. The company, a maker of telephone equipment, said it would take a charge against fourth-quarter earnings because a British customer, Iaxis Ltd., probably would not be able to pay its bills. Ciena closed at $216.33, down $13.80 on the day.
But Niagara Mohawk Holdings rose $1.88, to $15.75, after the National Grid Group, which owns a power transmission network in England and Wales, agreed to buy the utility owner for $3 billion, or about $19 a share.
"Utility stocks traded well," said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "There is evidence the economy might be weaker than we thought it was, so people are looking for a defensive tilt to their portfolios."

Treasury Prices Fall
(By Reuters) -- Treasury bond prices declined slightly yesterday in sluggish trading as players cast a cautious glance at rising oil prices and an impending onslaught of corporate debt.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32, to 108 11/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.67 percent from 5.66 percent on Friday. The 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32, to a price of 100 16/32. The note's yield was unchanged at 5.68 percent.
Treasury prices fell early in the session as dealers returned from the long Labor Day weekend in a consolidative mood after weak economic data released Friday fueled hopes that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates for the foreseeable future.
But the market clawed back from almost all its losses. Dealers cited the Fed's purchase on the open market of a scant $498 million of longer-dated Treasuries as a partial catalyst for the rebound.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.467	96.467	High Rate	6.06%	6.03%	Investment Rate	6.24%	6.30%	Low Rate	6.03%	5.98%	Median Rate	6.06%	6.02%	Total applied for	$33,380,008	$27,334,831	Accepted	$13,974,418	$12,623,986	Noncompetitive	$1,229,265	$1,162,046	
 
Both issues are dated Sept. 7. The three-month bills mature on Dec. 7, and the six-month bills mature on March 8, 2001.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT;
The Very Model Of Conciliation

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE 

 BODY:
In the early 1990's, the United States Postal Service had an employee crisis on its hands. Not the workplace shootings that made headlines and added the phrase "going postal" to the American vocabulary of violence. Those incidents, while often deadly, were isolated.
What really threatened the agency's productivity and morale was an avalanche of complaints by angry, frustrated employees to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. For years, charges of racial discrimination, sexual harassment and other management abuses poured into the watchdog agency from the Postal Service, and the volume of informal complaints had built up to an incredible 30,000 filings a year, more than from any other single employer. Some of the complaints escalated into costly litigation, while others festered. 
 But in 1994 as part of a settlement of a class-action lawsuit, lawyers at the Postal Service, one of the nation's largest employers, started one of the most ambitious experiments in dispute resolution in American corporate history. They created a program called Redress to settle disputes using neutral outside mediators, and tested it in a few cities before rolling it out nationally in 1997.
The results were spectacular: in the first 22 months of full operation, from September 1998 through June of this year, 17,645 informal disputes were mediated under Redress and of those, 80 percent were resolved.
During the same period, formal complaints, which peaked at 14,000 by 1997, dropped 30 percent. The lawyers estimate that the program has saved the agency millions of dollars in legal costs and improved productivity, to say nothing of the gains in intangibles like job satisfaction.
Now, two of the Postal Service's lawyers, Cynthia J. Hallberlin, former chief counsel, and Mary S. Elcano, former general counsel, have left for private practice at the Brown & Wood law firm in Washington, and are taking a similar program, which they have named Wins, on a road show. They are convinced that if mediation worked wonders for the Postal Service, it could do so at any company or organization.
Already, the World Bank has signed on for a review of its mediation program, and others, including investment banks, dot-coms and recognized brand-name manufacturers, are interested, the lawyers say. What is selling them, they say, is Redress's record.
Corporate America certainly needs the help. High-profile racial discrimination and sexual-harassment class-action lawsuits filed in recent years against industry giants like Texaco and Coca-Cola are only the tip of the litigation iceberg. Employment discrimination cases nearly tripled between 1990 and 1998, to 23,735 filings in federal district courts, according to the Justice Department.
To be sure, companies are not sitting on their hands. A survey of Fortune 1,000 companies in 1997 by the Cornell Institute on Conflict Resolution found that the majority were doing some form of what is known as alternative dispute resolution to avoid litigation.
But Ms. Elcano and Ms. Hallberlin say they possess one thing that no one else can offer, a huge database of statistics and exit surveys, which they say proves how valuable their form of mediation, called transformative mediation, was to postal workers.
In it, the parties involved control the process and the outcome.
"We have found that companies are very interested in transformative mediation," Ms. Hallberlin said, "because of its promise to not just solve the problem at hand, but to help the parties communicate more effectively in the future."
Before Redress was created, Postal Service employees embroiled in disputes with their bosses followed procedures that could drag on for years. Generally, they would begin by filing an informal E.E.O.C. complaint. They then had the choice of dropping the matter or going down the bureaucratic path of filing a formal grievance, starting an official investigation with all its affidavits and hearings. Ultimately, they might file a lawsuit.
The Redress program aimed to short-circuit that process by offering disgruntled workers mediation. If a person who filed an informal complaint agreed, a meeting would be set up, a mediator would hear both sides of the dispute and, in most instances, help propose a solution within a day.
Sometimes, all the worker wanted was for his boss to say he was sorry. "The power of an apology became very significant," Ms. Elcano said. "People would walk away from litigation with that because they felt it was an honest give and take."
For example, one supervisor called all of his mail carriers by a number, Ms. Hallberlin said. One carrier thought it was demeaning and filed a complaint. When confronted about it in mediation, the supervisor said he had had no idea that some people found the practice offensive and said he would stop it immediately. Case closed.
"You're never going to get rid of conflict," Ms. Hallberlin said, "you just want to handle it better."
Robert A. Baruch Bush, a law professor at Hofstra University who helped design a training program for the 3,000 outside mediators in Redress, said the goal was to shift conversations between employees and their supervisors from destructive to constructive. "If that happens," he said, "it becomes a more open corporation, and then the parties themselves in most cases will be able to define what's bothering them and how to fix it." Resolution is a byproduct, he added.
Redress is intended to make mediation available at any stage of the grievance process, not just at the beginning. In one class-action racial-discrimination lawsuit that had originated in an E.E.O.C. complaint, black postal workers in Florida accused a white postmaster of making racist remarks about their work habits. They sought his dismissal, Ms. Hallberlin said.
It never came to that or to a dollar settlement, she said, because both parties agreed to bring in an outside mediator. In the end, the postmaster apologized, wrote a check to the N.A.A.C.P. and joined the Postal Service's diversity committee. "In future dealings, he had a more harmonious post office," Ms. Hallberlin said.
Elaine Kirsch, an outside mediator working in New York, recalled a case involving a postal supervisor and an employee, both women, one white and one black, neither willing to back down. The dispute was over the employee's repeated lateness, Ms. Kirsch said, but really it was about a lack of communication. After yelling at each other for one and a half hours, she said, the two became quiet.
Ms. Kirsch said she took the opportunity to point out that the two had more in common than they had thought. Sometime after that, she said, the supervisor and employee returned to hammering out particular issues and rehashing events. Finally, one said words to this effect: "You never lied. You always say what you mean."
The ice was broken, Ms. Kirsch said, "and from then on it was easy as pie." It turned out that the employee was often late because she had trouble finding care for her asthmatic child. She agreed to call her supervisor when this happened and her supervisor agreed to be more understanding.
To keep tabs on Redress's progress, the Postal Service hired Lisa Bingham, director of the Conflict Resolution Center at Indiana University. "Quantifying has been one of the problems with the field of dispute resolution for some time," Ms. Bingham said.
Her exit-survey research showed that postal employees and their union representatives and supervisors were highly satisfied with the process and the mediators. And, to a lesser degree, the parties were satisfied with the outcome.
Mary P. Rowe, an adjunct professor at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., said Redress "was large, elaborate and better evaluated than virtually any other component or system like it."
And, said Professor Rowe, a longtime ombudsperson at M.I.T., there was no reason that programs like Redress should not thrive in the private sector. "Conflict management programs should function in every milieu," she said.
Not everyone is a big fan of mediation, of course, least of all the plaintiffs' bar. "Damages are often the best way to make up for how someone has been harmed," said Pamela Coukos, a lawyer for Mehri, Malkin & Ross, the Washington firm handling the class-action lawsuit against Coca-Cola. "Money can be a measure of how much respect you are given by a company." At the very least, Ms. Coukos said, workers with grievances should have a choice between litigation or some type of nonjudicial dispute resolution.
And in fact, such dispute resolution is widespread. Of the 606 companies surveyed by Cornell, for example, 88 percent reported using mediation at least once in the preceding three years and 79 percent reported using arbitration, which like mediation employs outside neutral parties, but unlike mediation, reaches a binding solution.
Today, said David B. Lipsky, the Cornell professor who conducted the 1997 survey with Ronald L. Seeber, companies are moving from a piecemeal approach to unified programs.
A little more than a year ago, for example, the Prudential Insurance Company of America in Newark, started its own program called Roads to Resolution. Oliver B. Quinn, the program director, said Prudential took the step to develop a system that offered mediation and arbitration in light of the litigation erupting elsewhere.
And as part of its settlement of a multimillion-dollar racial discrimination case, Texaco created an Ombuds Program in February 1998. Later that year, the company folded it and other programs like mediation and arbitration into a problem-resolution system.
As a result, Carole A. Young, director of the Ombuds program, said a court-appointed task force had determined that litigation had been reduced by nearly half in the first year.
In the meantime, the good news continues for the Postal Service. Karen Intrater, one of the lawyers who came up with the idea of Redress, said the program had been so successful it was catching on among government agencies.
"It's not a magic pill, but you can see the difference," Ms. Intrater said. "I've never seen anything that has such a potential for change as this."

HEADLINE: Senator Pushes Bill to Expand I.R.A. Limits

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, William V. Roth Jr., namesake of the popular Roth I.R.A., unveiled legislation today that would create a similar 401(k) plan and raise contribution limits for individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans.
"Despite a roaring economy, many Americans still are not saving enough money for retirement," said Senator Roth, Republican of Delaware. "We need to make it easier and more appealing for Americans to save for retirement, both through their employers and through their own individual retirement accounts." 
 The bill, similar to a measure the House passed overwhelmingly in July, would raise annual contribution limits to 401(k) plans to $15,000 from $10,500. For I.R.A.'s, the limits would rise to $5,000 from $2,000 a year.
A new 401(k) option would be created that, like the Roth I.R.A., embraced by millions, would let people contribute after-tax dollars that could later be withdrawn tax-free.
There also would be a "catch-up" provision for those over 50 to contribute up to $7,500 a year to an I.R.A., aimed primarily at women who left the work force to raise children and were not able to keep pace with their retirement savings.
The White House, which opposed the House bill, reacted coolly to the latest measure as well but has not issued a veto threat. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the bill could make it easier for businesses to provide pensions for top executives while not helping rank-and-file employees and lower-income people who do not have retirement plans.
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore support creation of retirement savings accounts for lower-income people in which the government would provide a match in the form of a tax credit. But many Democrats in Congress support the concepts in the Roth legislation, which will be brought to the Senate floor this month under budget rules that limit debate and amendments.
"So many of these provisions have Democratic sponsors," said Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida. "I am optimistic we can arrive at a bipartisan consensus."
The Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, said Democrats would consider the overall cost of all these tax cuts in deciding whether to support Mr. Roth's legislative package.

THE INTEREST GROUPS
 
ATTACKING BUSH ON GUNS -- Handgun Control Inc., a nonprofit lobbying group, will begin running a television advertisement in five swing states on Wednesday that sharply criticizes Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Handgun Control plans to spend more than $1 million on the effort, the largest in its history, said Joe Sudbay, the organization's political director. Mr. Sudbay said the commercial would initially run in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee and St. Louis, the largest cities in five of the most closely contested states.
The 30-second spot, which is similar to one the group ran earlier, says Mr. Bush signed laws that allow Texans to carry concealed handguns. It then cuts to Kayne Robinson, first vice president of the National Rifle Association, saying that if Mr. Bush wins, "We'll have a president where we work out of their office." 
 Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, objected to the portrayal. "Governor Bush has said he will be the only one working out of the office," Mr. Bartlett said. James Dao
 
THE DEMOCRATS
 
FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY -- On a swing through Midwest battleground states, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut said yesterday that Democrats were the best stewards of the economy, while Republicans would return the government to huge deficits. Speaking to the breakfast crowd at a diner in Peoria, Ill., and at a forum in a St. Louis suburb, Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, said that Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, had promised tax cuts and new spending that would leave the federal government more than $1 trillion in debt.
"After their tax cuts, there's no money left over in the till, unless you're going to go back into deficit again," he said at Oakville Senior High School. And Mr. Lieberman called the Medicare prescription drug plan unveiled by Mr. Bush today unworkable. "I don't know where Governor Bush is going to get the money," he said. "There's nothing left after the big tax cut." Richard Perez-Pena
 
THE GREEN PARTY
 
SUPPORT FOR HEMP -- Ralph Nader on Tuesday joined people who want to grow and market industrial hemp in criticizing federal agencies for making it difficult to grow the crop. Mr. Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate, also spoke out against a recent raid on a South Dakota Indian reservation in which federal agents seized at least 2,000 plants the owner said were industrial-grade hemp.
Hemp cannot be grown commercially in the United States because it is in the same family as marijuana, although Mr. Nader pointed out that the levels of hallucinogenic THC are far lower in hemp than in marijuana. "It is analogous to consuming poppy seed bagels or nonalcoholic beer," he said. "Although these foods both have a small psychoactive component, people do not abuse them." Mr. Nader said the Drug Enforcement Administration was proposing rules requiring that a product containing any THC be listed in the same category as heroin and LSD. (AP)

How to Create a Shortage In a Skilled-Labor Market

BYLINE: By Richard Rothstein; E-mail: rrothstein@nytimes.com

 BODY:
TO alleviate apparent shortages of computer programmers, President Clinton and Congress have agreed to raise a quota on H-1B's, the temporary visas for skilled foreigners. The annual limit will go to 200,000 next year, up from 65,000 only three years ago.
The imported workers, most of whom come from India, are said to be needed because American schools do not graduate enough young people with science and math skills. Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, and Intel's chairman, Andrew S. Grove, told Congress in June that more visas were only a stopgap until education improved. 
 But the crisis is a mirage. High-tech companies portray a shortage, yet it is our memories that are short: only yesterday there was a glut of science and math graduates.
The computer industry took advantage of that glut by reducing wages. This discouraged youths from entering the field, creating the temporary shortages of today. Now, taking advantage of a public preconception that school failures have created the problem, industry finds a ready audience for its demands to import workers.
This newspaper covered the earlier surplus extensively. In 1992, it reported that 1 in 5 college graduates had a job not requiring a college degree. A 1995 article headlined "Supply Exceeds Demand for Ph.D.'s in Many Science Fields" cited nationwide unemployment of engineers, mathematicians and scientists. "Overproduction of Ph.D. degrees," it noted, "seems to be highest in computer science."
Michael S. Teitelbaum, a demographer who served as vice chairman of the Commission on Immigration Reform, said in 1996 that there was "an employer's market" for technology workers, partly because of post-cold-war downsizing in aerospace.
In fields with real labor scarcity, wages rise. Yet despite accounts of dot-com entrepreneurs' becoming millionaires, trends in computer technology pay do not confirm a need to import legions of programmers.
Salary offers to new college graduates in computer science averaged $39,000 in 1986 and had declined by 1994 to $33,000 (in constant dollars). The trend reversed only in the late 1990's.
The West Coast median salary for experienced software engineers was $71,100 in 1999, up only 10 percent (in constant dollars) from 1990. This pay growth of about 1 percent a year suggests no labor shortage.
Norman Matloff, a computer science professor at the University of California, contends that high-tech companies create artificial shortages by refusing to hire experienced programmers. Many with technology degrees no longer work in the field. By age 50, fewer than half are still in the industry. Luring them back requires higher pay.
Industry spokesmen say older programmers with outdated skills would take too long to retrain. But Dr. Matloff counters by saying that when they urge more H-1B visas, lobbyists demonstrate a shortage by pointing to vacancies lasting many months. Companies could train older programmers in less time than it takes to process visas for cheaper foreign workers.
Dr. Matloff says that in addition to the pay issue, the industry rejects older workers because they will not work the long hours typical at Silicon Valley companies with youthful "singles" styles. Imported labor, he argues, is only a way to avoid offering better conditions to experienced programmers. H-1B workers, in contrast, cannot demand higher pay: visas are revoked if workers leave their sponsoring companies.
As for young computer workers, the labor market has recently tightened, with rising wages, because college students saw earlier wage declines and stopped majoring in math and science. In 1996, American colleges awarded 25,000 bachelor's degrees in computer science, down from 42,000 in 1985.
The reason is not that students suddenly lacked preparation. On the contrary, high school course-taking in math and science, including advanced placement, had climbed. Further, math scores have risen; last year 24 percent of seniors who took the SAT scored over 600 in math. But only 6 percent planned to major in computer science, and many of these cannot get into college programs.
The reason: colleges themselves have not yet adjusted to new demand. In some places, computer science courses are so oversubscribed that students must get on waiting lists as high school juniors.
With a time lag between student choice of majors and later job quests, high schools and colleges cannot address short-term supply and demand shifts for particular professions. Such shortages can be erased only by raising wages to attract those with needed skills who are now working in other fields -- or by importing low-paid workers.
For the longer term, rising wages can guide counselors to encourage well-prepared students to major in computer science and engineering, and colleges will adjust to rising demand. But more H-1B immigrants can have a perverse effect, as their lower pay signals young people to avoid this field in the future, keeping the domestic supply artificially low.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Withhold Money for Haiti's Presidential Election

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 5

 BODY:
The United States will not send observers or financial aid to Haiti for that country's presidential elections in November, a senior American diplomat said today, citing the Haitian government's unwillingness to recalculate the results of recent legislative elections that gave an overwhelming and disputed majority to the party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Washington will also scrutinize all other development aid to Haiti to ensure that it does not go directly to the Haitian government, but through private nongovernmental organizations, said Luis Lauredo, the American ambassador to the Organization of American States. And it will review hundreds of millions of dollars in loans pending before international financial institutions. 
 The measures were announced during a meeting in Washington of the O.A.S., which issued its own critical report of a recent mission to Haiti that failed to nudge the Haitian government towards resolving the political crisis. Other countries have repeatedly criticized the Haitian government for installing a Parliament chosen using a controversial methodology that gave Mr. Aristide's Family Lavalas party 18 of 19 Senate seats. Electoral observers said that 10 of those seats should have gone to a runoff, but Haitian electoral officials have rejected their demands.
"Absent new concrete steps to end the impasse, the United States will not be able to conduct 'business as usual' with Haiti," Mr. Lauredo said at today's meeting.
A senior State Department official said that American diplomats visited Haiti last week to warn Haitian officials, including Mr. Aristide and his protege, President Rene Preval, of the impending measures. Among the points they pressed were the need to reconsider the contested election results as well as to name an electoral council that would have the confidence of the Haitian people.
The last president of the provisional electoral council resigned and went into exile soon after the May elections, saying he had been pressured to ratify questionable results.
However, the Haitian government's decision to proceed with the new Parliament, the first since January 1999, left the United States with few other options.
While the official could not specify how much money would be withheld, the United States provided about $25 million for the last elections. The American refusal to provide financial assistance for the presidential elections could further hamper the image of Mr. Aristide, who is presumed to be seeking re-election to the office. "Without aid it is going to cast further doubts on the credibility of the process," the official said.
It would also present logistical problems, because poverty-stricken Haiti needs to register voters and candidates, set up polling places and hire poll workers. Many poll workers have yet to be paid for their work in the May elections, American officials said.
Cesar Gaviria, the secretary general of the O.A.S., said that while the international community was willing to help foster a dialogue, the Haitian government needs to show its willingness to participate.
"It seems there is no political will to resolve the problems of the May elections," he said. "That increases the skepticism and the worries of the international community and some segments of Haitian society about democracy in Haiti and democratic institutions in Haiti."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN NEW YORK: THE VISITING MULLAH;
President of Iran Praises His Country's Civilization

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 5

 BODY:
As a battle between supporters and opponents of democratic reform rages at home, President Mohammad Khatami of Iran came to the United Nations today to promote his campaign for a global "dialogue among civilizations" and to praise his country as one of the world's oldest.
Mr. Khatami, a midranking cleric who was swept to victory in a popular election three years ago on a platform promoting the rule of law, delivered a highly theoretical speech that offered no concrete proposal on how to promote global dialogue, no talk of his promises to promote reform at home and no mention of any country except his own. 
 Wearing a clerical robe and cloak and the black turban signifying that he is a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, Mr. Khatami instead quoted from the Koran and the 14th-century poet Hafiz and spoke of the importance of artists and poets, mystical thought and Islamic civilization and of the lack of empathy and compassion in the world.
"Let us hope that enmity and oppression should end, and that the clamor of love for truth, justice and human dignity should prevail," Mr. Khatami told an audience of several hundred, including a number of heads of state and invited Iranian expatriates.
He also warned about the dangers of unlimited globalization, saying, "Global culture cannot and should not overlook the characteristics and requirements of local cultures with the aim of imposing itself on them."
Seated in the front row of the audience a few yards away from Mr. Khatami was Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who came to New York early today to hear his 30-minute speech.
She applauded him twice -- when he was introduced and again at the end of his speech -- and left the conference room before any of the other speakers took the podium.
Despite the vagueness of much of the speech by Mr. Khatami, who was trained in philosophy at the University of Isfahan, Dr. Albright later called it thought-provoking and interesting.
A senior State Department official explained that Dr. Albright had attended because "there is no official dialogue with Iran at this point and we wanted to send a signal to the Iranians that we're willing to listen to what they have to say."
Dr. Albright also wanted to be present after she learned that Mr. Khatami would be seated in the General Assembly hall on Wednesday when President Clinton addresses the Assembly's 55th session, the official added.
But Dr. Albright and Mr. Khatami steered clear of each other at a reception just before the conference today, and Mr. Clinton will not try to meet his Iranian counterpart on Wednesday, the State Department official said.
The Clinton administration has pressed Iran to open an official dialogue as a first step toward drawing a "road map" for the eventual normalization of relations, but Iran has repeatedly refused.
Since Mr. Khatami became president in 1997, one of his main themes has been the need for a "dialogue among civilizations," code words for bridging the gap between an Islamic government like Iran's, which is still subject to American economic sanctions, and secular nations around the world.
He proposed making 2001 the year of such dialogue in his maiden speech before the General Assembly two years ago. Today's event was the kickoff of that endeavor as well as the prelude to the opening of the annual Assembly session and the three-day summit meeting that will bring together more than 150 world leaders.
Mr. Khatami's appearance today was dramatically different from his United Nations debut two years ago. Back then he had been president for a little more than a year, and he wooed a receptive global audience with talk of how freedom-loving and law-abiding Iran was becoming.
Now, Iran's reformist press is shut down, many of its reformist journalists and clerics have been imprisoned and its judiciary, dominated by ultra-conservative clerics, is determined to punish any behavior it considers un-Islamic.
Last month, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, who under the country's Constitution wields much more power than Mr. Khatami, stunned the nation when he directly intervened in the affairs of the newly elected Parliament, ordering it not to consider amending a restrictive press law.
More recently, vigilantes forcibly prevented two reformist leaders from speaking in the western industrial city of Khurramabad, touching off days of rioting in which a policeman was killed and more than 100 people were injured.
Near the Iranian mission to the United Nations today, at about the same time that Mr. Khatami was speaking, a rally sponsored by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations demanded the release of 10 Iranian Jews convicted of espionage in July.
Among the speakers were Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, Representative Rick Lazio, the Republican candidate for the Senate in New York, and a number of Democrats including Representative Nita M. Lowey, also of New York.
"We are here to send a message to the president of Iran and the people of Iran," Mr. Pataki said. "The 10 do not stand alone. We are in solidarity with them."
"No more caviar and Iranian rugs while our brothers are kept in jail," said the New York City public advocate, Mark Green, referring to the recent easing of the economic embargo against Iran to allow Americans to import Iranian caviar, carpets and pistachios.
A few blocks away, across the street from the United Nations, more than 1,000 Iranian protesters representing the United States-based National Council of Resistance of Iran stood under a cloud of red, white and green balloons, protesting Mr. Khatami's visit and demanding the overthrow of the Tehran government.
"Death to Khatami!" the protesters chanted as they waved the flags of the People's Mujahedeen, Iran's main armed resistance organization, which the State Department classifies as a terrorist group. One of their signs read, "Murder, torture and execution continues in Iran."
On Monday, Mr. Khatami met with a handpicked group of 500 Iranian businessmen, academics, students and artists, stoking their Persian pride and exhorting them to invest in their homeland.
"Our hearts are beating for the love of one place, and this place is Iran," Mr. Khatami said.
Before Mr. Khatami spoke, five expatriates delivered their own speeches.
"Cultural freedom is not relative," said R. K. Ramazani, professor of government at the University of Virginia. He warned of "national suicide" if the Iranian people's demands for freedom are overlooked.
Jahangir Ghaznavi, who heads a Pittsburgh investment company, drew loud applause when he suggested ways to attract Iranian expatriates back home.
"Mr. Khatami, open the economic doors," he said. "Make coming and going in and out of the country easier. Try to guarantee investments as is done in other countries. Remove political obstacles for investments."
Two years ago Mr. Khatami held a similar meeting with hundreds of expatriates. But that time he allowed the audience to ask questions in what turned out to be an extraordinarily freewheeling exchange. This time, in a sign of the times in Iran perhaps, no questions were allowed from the floor. There was only a box into which guests could deposit their questions and comments.

HEADLINE: Hospital Chief To Lead Aetna Managed Care

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
John W. Rowe, who oversaw one of the largest hospital mergers in New York City and in the process became one of the industry's most prominent executives, was named president and chief executive of Aetna U.S. Healthcare late yesterday.
In Dr. Rowe, the chief executive of the Mount Sinai N.Y.U. Medical Center and Health System, Aetna is hiring a well-known geriatrics specialist who has helped his hospital, a combined unit of the two big urban medical centers, stay afloat in extremely troubled times. 
 In Aetna, the country's largest health insurer, Dr. Rowe takes over a company that is faced with the difficult task of improving customer relations while raising prices for managed-care coverage. Last month, the company reported a 17 percent drop in second-quarter profit; in a preliminary proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, it reported profit margins of less than 2 percent. Dr. Rowe will begin on Sept. 15.
Through mergers, Aetna acquired U.S. Healthcare, the NYLcare unit of New York Life Insurance and Prudential Health Care, which had lost money for the Prudential Life Insurance Company of America.
Under a former chief executive, Richard Huber, Aetna became a favorite target for angry doctors and other critics of managed care. William H. Donaldson, Mr. Huber's successor, has tried to calm the waters by relaxing controls on patient care, thereby risking higher internal costs, and reduced profits or perhaps losses.
Wall Street analysts have urged Mr. Donaldson to find an experienced chief for the health care business, which will be spun off into a single company. Such a search is no easy task at a time health maintenance organizations have had troubles of their own.
Once Aetna completes the planned spinoff of its health care unit, Dr. Rowe will become chief executive of the single company and Mr. Donaldson will remain chairman, a spokeswoman for Aetna said.
Aetna and Dr. Rowe come together in a climate of some hostility between hospitals and insurers. Dr. Rowe, like his counterparts in New York, has complained of financial stress in recent years, brought on in part by what they have said is increased pressure from managed-care companies.
"I see a lot of dissatisfaction with health insurance processes," Dr. Rowe said, "and I think that Aetna, because of its strength as the largest health insurance company in the nation, has an opportunity to play a very significant role to change this. I am very excited about this new platform."
The Mount Sinai-N.Y.U. center is in better shape than many other medical centers in New York, though that may seem analogous to being the healthiest patient in an intensive care ward. The center earned only about $20 million on $1.7 billion in revenue last year and expects to earn roughly the same on $1.8 billion in revenue this year, partly through budget cuts like the elimination of consultants and of some management positions. The N.Y.U. hospitals ran at a deficit, a spokesman said.
While the merged medical centers have increased their share of business even as others around them lost patients over the last few years, cash flow is still tight.
"I would characterize Mount Sinai-N.Y.U. Health as stronger than most in the New York marketplace," said Liz Sweeney, a director in health care ratings at Standard & Poor's, which rates the hospital's bonds BBB+, or investment grade, with a stable outlook. "But from a national perspective, it is weaker than what we see at other organizations around the country."
New York trails its national counterparts in several ways. Managed care came late to the region, leaving many doctors and hospitals flat-footed. More important, the state had a regulated pricing policy for hospitals until 1997, and when deregulation was introduced in 1997, competition suddenly became part of the landscape.
Adding the Balanced Budget Act of the same year, which reduced some payments to hospitals under Medicare, and the arrival of managed care in the marketplace, hospitals were suddenly like retailers, battling for customers and increasing their marketing budgets to sell things like pretty maternity wards and prominent doctors. Some centers have since filed for bankruptcy.
"New York hospitals tend to be highly leveraged," Ms. Sweeney said. "Their balance sheets tend to be thin."
Dr. Rowe, who is 56, has made many moves to help his merged center gain strides. He came to Mount Sinai in 1988 as president of the hospital and medical school and set his sights on a modernization of the campus. A one-million-square-foot inpatient center designed by I. M. Pei was added in 1993, and two other new buildings went up later while older ones were overhauled.
He also built up the center's home health agency, where revenue increased to $59 million last year from $3 million in 1998. On Dr. Rowe's watch, Mount Sinai's medical school gained stature; in 1997, the school received $97.7 million in support from the National Institutes of Health. While New York University and Mount Sinai did not meld their medical schools or clinical departments, the merged unit has saved about $24 million in administrative costs.
Dr. Rowe is among New York's more accessible hospital executives and enjoys giving interviews on topics ranging from health care economics to gerontology.
A professor of medicine at Mount Sinai's School of Medicine, he often goes on rounds with residents, during which he has been known to chat about acute renal failure, brag about the hospital's savings on its meal program and recall banter once exchanged with I. M. Pei.
Before joining Mount Sinai, he was the founding director of the division of aging at Harvard Medical School and chief of gerontology at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. He has written extensively on geriatric medicine and aging.
"This is a big win for Aetna," said James R. Tallon, the president of the United Hospital Fund, a philanthropy group. "The issues facing the insurance industry and health care industry are complicated long-term issues, and someone of Jack's stature can only be positive for Aetna."
And while some could argue that Dr. Rowe is joining forces with a semi-adversary of sorts, Ms. Sweeney of Standard & Poor's said that could also work in Aetna's favor.
"Health plans and hospitals sit across from each other in negotiations," she said. "So from that perspective, I am sure he is valuable to them. But it could seem like now he is part of the problem."

HEADLINE: Challenge to Wine Sale Law Can Proceed in U.S. Court

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER 

 BODY:
A federal judge in Manhattan refused yesterday to dismiss a legal challenge to New York State's laws barring the direct shipment of wine from out-of-state wineries.
Although the state's ban on interstate wine sales was found constitutional 30 years ago, Judge Richard M. Berman of United States District Court cited the evolution of both law and technology, including the advent of sales on the Internet, as a basis for re-examining the issue. 
 "Technological advancements facilitate -- as never before -- the commerce between and among states," the judge wrote. "The Internet increasingly is responsible for direct sale and shipment of goods to consumers."
The judge noted that the United States Supreme Court had held that the 21st Amendment, which repealed prohibition and allowed states to regulate liquor sales, was not intended "to empower states to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers" to competition.
The lawsuit, one of several around the country challenging state bans on interstate wine sales, has been seen as a national test case in part because New York is the second biggest wine market in the country after California and is also a major wine producer.
Judge Berman's ruling was preliminary. No legal discovery has taken place in the case, and the judge did not address the merits of the suit. And for purposes of making his ruling, Judge Berman said he was "constrained to assume" that the plaintiff's allegations were true -- that the New York law is economic protectionism.
The suit, filed by two wineries in Virginia and California and three consumers in New York, says that the ban on interstate shipments violates the commerce clause of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of commerce. The suit also contends that the law violates the First Amendment, in banning advertising that solicits such sales.
The plaintiffs are represented by a libertarian legal advocacy group in Washington, the Institute for Justice, whose litigation director, Clint Bolick, called the ruling a victory for consumers and small wineries.
"It's David 1, Goliath 0," Mr. Bolick said.
Lawyers for New York State and members of its liquor industry retailers and wholesalers, union workers and a prominent religious figure who argued that the law promotes temperance expressed confidence yesterday that the law would not be overturned.
They argue that the Supreme Court has held that the 21st Amendment gives states wide latitude in regulating interstate sales of liquor. They also cited the preliminary nature of yesterday's ruling, which allows the case to proceed to discovery and trial.
Two lawyers who argued on behalf of the defendants said in a statement that New York had "good reasons" for its ban: "to ensure accountability and responsibility, to promote temperance, to provide orderly market conditions and to collect taxes."
"Those are legitimate state interests that our Constitution protects," said the lawyers, Randy M. Mastro and Howard Graff. The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, the pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, also filed legal papers defending the law, saying its overturning would have "devastating consequences."
"Minors will be able to order alcohol from out-of-state suppliers at the click of a mouse on the Internet or over the telephone," Mr. Butts said in the court papers. He did not return a telephone call seeking comment yesterday.
One of the plaintiffs, Juanita G. Swedenburg, the co-owner of a small family winery in Middleburg, Va., said she was delighted with the ruling. She said tourists from New York and other states who visited her vineyard often asked her to ship bottles of wine to their homes.
"And the public cannot figure out why it's illegal," she said, "when they call me and say, 'I love that chardonnay and send me a case.' And I say, 'I can't do that.' "

HEADLINE: Incumbent With Party Backing May Still Be Vulnerable

SERIES: NEW YORK PRIMARY: 31st Assembly District

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Pauline Rhodd-Cummings won her seat in the State Assembly two years ago by prevailing in a special election against three other candidates. Five months later, she beat back a primary challenge, and then defeated two other candidates in the general election.
But even after winning all those votes, Ms. Rhodd-Cummings continued to be viewed as a vulnerable member of the Assembly, though she has the backing of the Queens Democratic Party hierarchy. 
 The primary on Tuesday offers no respite. Ms. Rhodd-Cummings is being challenged by a college professor who is a first-time candidate running a vigorous campaign that has undercurrents of ethnic politics.
The challenger, Taj Rajkumar, teaches remedial reading at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. Mr. Rajkumar, who was born in Guyana, is looking for support from the growing number of Guyanese immigrants in the 31st Assembly District, which includes the southeastern Queens neighborhoods of South Ozone Park, Richmond Hill, Springfield Gardens and, across Jamaica Bay, Far Rockaway.
The district is about 55 percent black and about 15 percent Hispanic. Luther Blake, a consultant on demographics, estimates that Guyanese immigrants are nearly 30 percent of the population. "But how many of these immigrants are registered is the question," Mr. Blake said.
Despite her incumbency and the party support she has received, the Jamaican-born Ms. Rhodd-Cummings said she was taking her challenger seriously. For one thing, Mr. Rajkumar has amassed twice as much campaign money as she has.
And if, as expected, turnout is low, operating a campaign with a vigorous get-out-the-vote operation is considered critical to winning.
So far, Mr. Rajkumar, 43, has raised about $40,000 to be used in the primary campaign, roughly half of which is from a loan he secured.
He said Ms. Rhodd-Cummings had not provided effective leadership in her two years in office and that he would place far greater emphasis on developing educational programs, clinics to assist immigrants and programs to help residents get jobs.
Ms. Rhodd-Cummings said she had raised nearly $20,000, and added that she would have to rely on her campaign foot soldiers and her record to make up for the shortfall.
Ms. Rhodd-Cummings, a former bookkeeper in the garment industry, won her first political victory two years ago in the special election to fill the seat vacated by Gregory W. Meeks, who had just been elected to Congress.
Before being elected to the Assembly, Ms. Rhodd-Cummings was the chairwoman of the economic development committee of her local community board. Her principal political benefactor is City Councilwoman Juanita E. Watkins, who asked her to run for the Assembly seat.
In this campaign, Ms. Rhodd-Cummings has highlighted not so much broad themes describing her views on issues, as much as her ability to deliver bread-and-butter services to the district. She speaks, for example, of her success at working with other leaders to have the old, coal-burning furnace removed from Far Rockaway High School and in obtaining $500,000 to renovating a building to be used as a technical college.
She also talks of having the state's five-year capital budget include money to renovate the Mott Avenue subway station in Far Rockaway.
"The fact of the matter is that I am the candidate that has the community's interest at heart," she said. "My emphasis is to deliver to the people the things that they need to improve the conditions in the district. And I have been doing that."
The intensity of the campaign can be seen throughout the district's major thoroughfares, where posters of both candidates seem to be everywhere. Mr. Rajkumar's signs are most prominent along Liberty Avenue, which is dotted with markets and roti shops owned by Guyanese immigrants.
Mr. Rajkumar speaks with pride of his journey from being a newly arrived immigrant working in a garment district factory in Manhattan to earning a doctorate and becoming a college professor. "My campaign is geared toward the needy, the poor, the homeless and the elderly," he said. "I want to represent the people who have been forgotten."
Ms. Rhodd-Cummings has been endorsed by Representative Meeks as well nearly every elected official in southeastern Queens, which leads most Queens politicians to predict that she will prevail. Still, Mr. Rajkumar said that what he lacked in political endorsements had been made up by the dozens of volunteers who have worked the streets of the district on his behalf every day.
Both candidates maintain that they are not targeting any one group to the exclusion of another. "My campaign is designed to appeal to everyone in this community," Ms. Rhodd-Cummings said. "This is not an ethnic campaign. I'm running hard, and running everywhere in the district."

HEADLINE: A Window on the World;
Colleges Broaden Freshman Orientation, Pushing Students to Focus on Social Issues

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Time was when freshman orientation consisted largely of campus tours and introductions to the football team and the student newspaper. But in recent years, college officials have been trying to squeeze extra mileage out of those early hours on campus when students are most open to new ideas and experiences, offering them serious social issues to digest, not just choices of fraternity rushes.
Last week, for example, after the briefest of welcomes, incoming students at Baruch College were greeted on their first day with a discussion of the massacre of nearly one million Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994. Rather than being asked over the summer to pore over lists of dormitories and teams, the students had been asked to read "We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families: Stories from Rwanda." And Philip Gourevitch, the author of the book, was the freshman convocation's featured speaker. 
 For the 1,350 freshmen at Baruch, a campus of the City University of New York, this somber introduction to the world of current events was like a plunge into an icy lake. It caught their attention.
While the subject at Baruch was especially sobering, students at other colleges were also being steeped in the problems of the world. At the University of Pennsylvania, freshmen attended seminars on topics from eating disorders to bribery and corruption. Incoming students at Mount Holyoke College will be pounding nails with Habitat for Humanity. At Defiance College in Ohio, freshmen are fanning out to the community to register voters.
Barnard freshmen are cleaning up a local playground and helping at local charities like the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and the Gay Men's Health Crisis. And in one of the more inventive twists on diversity, the Barnard freshmen joined students at Columbia last Wednesday for an evening of theatrical monologues reflecting differences in cultural practices based on essays from some of the freshmen's own college applications. The monologues reflected the experiences of an Iranian woman growing up in a traditional home, a Taiwanese student adjusting to the United States, a secular Jew dining with Orthodox Jews, an Asian woman attending a predominantly Cuban high school in Florida, and a black man discovering pride in the color of his skin.
"Colleges are looking to recreate common experiences, particularly intellectual experiences that set an academic tone and raise expectations," said John N. Gardner, a senior fellow at the National Resource Center for the First Year Experience at the University of South Carolina.
Such experiences were common 40 or 50 years ago, he said, when there was greater homogeneity of students and more commonality in the curriculum, but eroded in the 60's and 70's. "Midcentury, it was easier to make assumptions about a body of knowledge that the students could relate to," he said.
At Baruch, which had not assigned a summer reading before this year, Myrna Chase, the acting provost and a historian, said she had wanted a book that would "make the students think about the world, about ethical concerns and about their responsibility for each other," issues she hoped the students would keep in mind throughout their college years.
For nearly an hour last Wednesday, in Baruch's ornate auditorium at Lexington Avenue and East 23rd Street, Mr. Gourevitch, a slender, dark-haired man of 38, offered the students a kind of template for learning by relating his own odyssey from his days as a Cornell freshman in 1979 -- when he was excited and anxious "about all that seemed possible" -- to his exploration of the horrifying complexities of Rwanda.
In words, he took the students with him on the physical journey to Rwanda -- flying for hours on end over the Swiss Alps, across the Mediterranean Sea and then across the "vast immensity of the Sahara desert."
But he also tried to take them with him on the intellectual pilgrimage that began with questions about why the Hutu majority had killed 800,000 members of the ruling Tutsi minority, how the killings had been allowed to occur, and "what hell was like."
He said he kept hearing that the genocide was chaos, but could not believe it "because it seemed obvious that it required the opposite of chaos to achieve such terrible and widespread destruction in such a concentrated fashion."
Over and over again, he seemed to be telling the students that it was all right not to have all the answers when starting out, so long as one looks for ways to find them.
Pushing students to think critically has become a major theme for colleges. Like Mr. Gourevitch's quest for answers in east Africa, the students' passage through college may also seem bewildering at times. In his preface to his book, before he even gets to the decomposed cadavers and still-clothed skeletons in a church on a rocky hill in eastern Rwanda, Mr. Gourevitch says: "This is a book about how people imagine themselves and one another -- a book about how we imagine our world."
The worlds that Baruch studentscome from are diverse. The college has admitted nearly 200 foreign students this year, as well as many immigrants who now call New York City home. There are nine from Africa (none from Rwanda), and many more from Asia, Eastern Europe and the Caribbean islands.
Some faculty members and administrators, including the college's new president, Edward V. Regan, had feared that genocide in Rwanda might be too grim a welcome to college life or seem too far removed from the students' own lives.
"When I first heard about the book, I said: 'Wait a minute. A lot of these kids open their front doors and see violence every day,' " Mr. Regan said last Wednesday.
But he said he had become convinced that Rwanda was "a different order of magnitude" and was pleased that Mr. Gourevitch "wasn't wagging a finger at the students and telling them to go out and find out what the world is about."
In small group sessions after the convocation and later that afternoon, the students expressed mixed reactions to the book. Some had read all 353 pages. Others dipped into a few chapters. All had strong feelings.
Kevon L. Logie, a 19-year-old freshman who came to New York from Trinidad last month, said the tensions between the more economically successful Tutsis and the less wealthy Hutus in Rwanda reminded him of the tensions between Indians and blacks in Trinidad.
"He said it is not about class lines, but I believe it is," said Mr. Logie, referring to Mr. Gourevitch. "Basically it was a class struggle."
Shanaz Gannie, 21, a junior who was one of the upperclassmen serving as counselors, said that while the book was a "weird" choice for a freshman summer reading, she thought it was a good one.
"You can ask what genocide has to do with me, if you are planning to go into business," said Ms. Gannie, who was born in Guyana. "But it helps you know there's another world out there. If you are going into marketing, you know that there are different kinds of markets."
Juliya Chernetsky, 18, said she definitely saw parallels with Russia, which she left when she was 7.
"A lot of things were promised to people if they would turn against their own people," she said, alluding to the Rwandans who killed friends and neighbors.
She added, however, that she did not think anything like the genocide in Rwanda could happen in America.
But in a small seminar after his lecture, Mr. Gourevitch told students that they could find parallels in American history, too.
"It's useful to think of the early American West," he said. "Think of the desperado bands. The Indian killers."
Baruch officials pronounced themselves well satisfied with the Rwanda discussion, and said they hoped that students and faculty members would return to the issues in the months to come.
David Potash, a history professor and director of academic services in the provost's office, said he planned to use the book in his American history courses in discussions about race.
"There is no attempt to make people use the book in their classes," he said. "But we hope it will come up and be a foundation experience for the students."

HEADLINE: The World's Meeting Place

 BODY:
The United Nations Millennium Summit this week brings to New York City the largest gathering ever of world leaders to address the most serious of global afflictions. It is an occasion calling for hope and perseverance, but most New Yorkers cannot get past the ominous numbers: 91 scheduled protests, at least 175 motorcades, 245 dignitaries requiring Secret Service and police protection, and 3 days of President Clinton stopping traffic in Manhattan. It is no wonder many residents welcome the meeting with the same grousing accorded the West Nile virus, the Atlanta Braves or a ride on the No. 4 subway line.
If the United Nations were headquartered in Tulsa or Des Moines, people might line the streets to greet the caravans ferrying foreign leaders with homemade signs wishing them well in their fight against illiteracy, AIDS and poverty. Kids would offer the delegates fresh lemonade, and signs at local high school football stadiums would read "Bobcats for Globalization!" or "Go Kofi!" 
 But not in New York. Though the city gains cachet and, by its own estimate, more than $3 billion a year in economic activity from housing the U.N., New Yorkers feel no compulsion to be grateful, or to pay a price, for the honor of being designated as the world's capital. More than a few residents think New York adds more to the U.N. than the world organization adds to New York.
But imagine the city without a United Nations. The constant stream of foreign leaders convening in New York, and their permanent representatives there, help to transform the city from mere financial center to world capital. Images of Nikita Khrushchev pounding the desk with his shoe and of countless other world leaders from Fidel Castro to Nelson Mandela addressing the General Assembly are an indelible part of the city's history. In contrast to some cases of town-gown friction, New York's U.N. campus is a fitting mirror of the city's own history as a mixing point of cultures and aspirations. It is as much a monument to New York's heritage as Ellis Island is.
Though New York is the perfect home for the United Nations, it did not have a lock on being chosen. Certainly if the U.N. were created today, it would more likely be based in Geneva or The Hague. Only in the immediate aftermath of World War II could a majority of nations have accepted the notion of the world's diplomatic forum being established in the United States.
Even among American cities, New York was not the initial front-runner for the U.N.'s permanent home. The American foreign-policy elite considered San Francisco, site of the organization's founding convention in 1945, the most desirable candidate, providing a more idyllic setting and a less Euro-centric perspective than New York or Washington. Though the U.N. had made New York its temporary home in the fall of 1946, Boston and Philadelphia were deemed stronger East Coast contenders.
To his credit, New York City's mayor at the time, William O'Dwyer, felt that getting the U.N. to stay for good was "the one great thing that would make New York the center of the world," but he had little to offer in the way of choice real estate or cash.
The solution came from Robert Moses, William Zeckendorf and Nelson Rockefeller. The three New Yorkers worked frantically in the week before the U.N.'s final headquarters decision, in December 1946, to cobble together a deal whereby John D. Rockefeller Jr., Nelson's father, would pay Mr. Zeckendorf $8.5 million for a plot of land on once-blighted Turtle Bay on Midtown Manhattan's East Side and the Rockefellers would then turn it over to the U.N. Mr. Moses, the longtime public servant who headed a blue-ribbon committee to keep the U.N. in New York, was able to secure some other goodies from the city and state. The rest, as they say, is Midtown congestion, and a shining spot in the diplomatic firmament.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN NEW YORK: THE U.N CHIEF;
Annan Says All Nations Must Cooperate to Solve Problems Like War and Poverty

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan warned today that the perennial problems of war, disease, poverty and pollution will never be resolved unless all countries cooperate, and he stressed that neither they nor the United Nations can accomplish the tasks unaided.
"I do not believe that the United Nations should be seen as doing everything, or that it should attempt to do everything by itself," Mr. Annan said. "The issues we are dealing with -- from the elimination of poverty to the fight against AIDS and the protection of the environment -- are issues that require all hands on deck." 
 He called the gathering a "defining moment for the world's leaders and for the United Nations."
 The secretary general spoke at a news conference before a three-day meeting of about 150 heads of state and other leaders here, which its United Nations organizers are calling the largest gathering of political leaders in history.
Mr. Annan first suggested the gathering three years ago, he said, "to harness the symbolic power of the millennium to the real and urgent needs of people everywhere."
He said he had tried to encourage a partnership of governments, international organizations, private businesses and foundations to bring their "collective impact" the bear on the world's ills.
"It is everyone's responsibility," Mr. Annan said. "We will play our catalytic role. We will press. We will advocate the issues. We will use the little money we have to help. But everyone has to do their bit."
The meeting of world leaders here will open on Wednesday and conclude on Friday with a joint declaration, a draft of which began circulating here on Monday.
The draft commits nations that sign it to "spare no effort to free our peoples from the scourge of war," and to promote democracy, expand respect for human rights and ensure access to economic development to every country.
Other resolutions call for ridding the world of poverty, promoting education and ending the spread of AIDS.
"I think these are big issues," Mr. Annan said. "This is also why I am challenging everyone to make a contribution. This is why I am telling the world leaders not only to come here and approve a plan of action, but that I would expect each and every one of them to go back home and begin to do something about it."
When a reporter pointed out that talk of ringing in peace and ending cruelty dated back to biblical times, Mr. Annan said: "The fact that the poor have always been with us does not mean we should not try to improve their lot and their conditions. Yes, you may think I am a dreamer, as some have called me, but without the dream you do not get anything done."
Closer to home, Mr. Annan was asked about prospects for expanding the 15-member Security Council, which many nations are seeking. He said he believed that an expansion was possible, though he doubted it could be achieved this year.
On Monday, Britain proposed increasing the overall size of the council and the number of permanent members. The United States' ambassador to the United Nations, Richard C. Holbrooke, also spoke last spring of expanding its membership even beyond 20 or 21 nations, which the United States had previously considered a maximum. Britain and the United States are now permanent members, with veto power, as are China, France and Russia.
Some Western critics of expansion argue that too many members would weaken the council and make decisions harder. But Mr. Annan said it ought to be possible to expand the council and make it more democratic and representative of the United Nations.
"I reject the idea that the expansion will necessarily lead to a confused, ineffective Security Council, which fudges all issues," he said. "I do not think, if there is a problem of that kind, that it is necessarily one of size."
Mr. Annan also welcomed an offer by Britain to establish a military staff college to train peacekeepers from around the world to serve with United Nations missions, calling the idea "something that I endorse wholeheartedly."
He also said he supported a new report recommending an overhaul of United Nations peacekeeping operations, which have stumbled in Sierra Leone and Congo, among other troubled countries.
"If we are going to conduct peacekeeping operations, we must do so effectively," he said. "Otherwise, we just stand with our arms crossed. But we cannot continue to work as we are doing now."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN NEW YORK: THE PROTESTERS;
A Quiet Forum at Town Hall Opposes the East River Forum

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
If the 150 or so national leaders assembled at the United Nations yesterday were curious about where globalization was really taking the world, they could have ambled over to Town Hall, the concert auditorium on West 43rd Street.
There, opinions abounded: 
 "The current stage of the world economy is the cancer stage."
"We should continue in cutting back the powers of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund."
"What is the global economy doing to the Earth? It's killing it."
The remarks came during a teach-in organized by the International Forum on Globalization, a group based in Northern California that opposes the spread of an unregulated free-market economy.
More than 900 people came to hear about the evils of American- and European-dominated financial institutions like the World Bank, the I.M.F. and the World Trade Organization. Issues mentioned in the forum, "Globalization and the Role of the United Nations," ranged from dam building in the Philippines to the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement on the world monetary system.
Many involved had taken part in the protests in November that tied up a meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle. In April, many of the same people, who represent causes ranging from environmental protection to the needs of indigenous cultures, took to the streets of Washington during a meeting of the World Bank and I.M.F.
But there were no black masks or tear gas in evidence yesterday, and the attendees appeared as well mannered as their counterparts in the United Nations complex overlooking the East River. An usher took tickets ($20 for general admission) and organizers handed out sheets the audience could use to rate panels (poor to excellent in various categories).
Relative calm prevailed partly because the teach-in was intended to be a discussion, not a demonstration, and partly because many attending were not ready to write off the United Nations as an unwitting tool of American corporations.
"The United Nations has traditionally had a mandate of social justice and peace and human rights," said Jerry Mander, founder of the forum. "But we've lately begun to worry that that mandate was weakening, and that the same ideologies that drive the W.T.O. will appear in the United Nations."
For the anti-globalization movement, the teach-in was not only a place to assess the role of the United Nations but also allowed participants to reflect on how far the movement had come since Seattle, and how much farther it had to go.
Many speakers said they did not oppose globalization per se because, in their view, the era of nation-states is coming to its inevitable end. But they oppose an emerging world economy where global policies are made by large corporations. Those policies, the speakers said, are paving the way for big business to exploit developing countries.
"We have entered the era of corporate rule," Mr. Mander said to the audience. "The familiar homily is this: The rising tide will lift all boats. Actually, it lifts yachts."
The four speakers on a panel introduced by Mr. Mander congratulated the movement for making its roar heard during the Seattle protests, but also rattled off a list of goals and strategies. Several panelists said economic boycotts would be the most effective way to get their message across to business executives.
Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, an advocate for indigenous people in the Philippines, implored listeners to urge the United Nations to adhere to its original goals. "More and more, we are seeing that the United Nations is abdicating its role in terms of social improvement, in terms of poverty alleviation," she said. "It is our role to still insist and assert that the United Nations is not a body that should be siding with the interests of capitalists or the interests of powerful corporations."
In some ways, the speeches at Town Hall echoed the goals of this week's summit meeting at the United Nations. The meeting there is intended as a forum where the voices of the smallest countries can be heard alongside those of the most powerful.
Hours before the teach-in began, President Muhammad Khatami of Iran said in his speech at the United Nations, "Global culture cannot and should not overlook the characteristics and requirements of local cultures with the aim of imposing itself on them."
And yesterday afternoon, a Matthew Garrington, 23, who grew up in Olympia, Wash., a world away from the Middle East, picked up several brochures on a table outside the teach-in and said, "Obviously globalization is going to happen, and I want to make sure it happens responsibly."

HEADLINE: H.M.O. Costs Spur Employers To Shift Plans

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Health insurance premiums are increasing by 10 percent to 30 percent across the country, according to employers, insurers and regional business groups familiar with the rates being paid by dozens of companies. Driven largely by escalating drug costs, the double-digit increase in annual premiums is the third consecutive one for many companies.
The rising premiums suggest that apart from the most restrictive, bare-bones health maintenance organizations, managed care is no longer keeping medical costs down. The industry has also been consolidating recently, increasing profits, but weakening the ability of employers to bargain on rates. 
 Many of the companies facing steep premium increases today actively encouraged their employees to join managed-care plans in the past, even though some health care experts warned that managed-care plans would not control costs in the long run. Now those companies are starting to turn away from H.M.O.'s toward insurance that does not entail the high administrative costs of managed care.
The double-digit increases come at a time of rising concern in Washington and in the presidential campaign about health care costs, particularly for drugs in the Medicare program. Both Gov. George W. Bush, and Vice President Al Gore have proposed ways to add drug coverage for the elderly.
The effects of the increasing premiums are likely to ripple through the economy. In contrast to the 1970's, when companies were able to pass along higher health care costs in the form of higher prices, today's rising premiums will cut into many companies' profits by adding to their operating costs.
Many technology companies, facing particularly fierce competition for workers, are among those absorbing the higher premiums. Higher rates would be "as unaffordable for employees as they are for the company," said Kathy Reinhardt, benefits director of Analog Devices, a chip manufacturer based in Norwood, Mass. "Fortunately, we can do it this year. It is real important that we continue to be able to attract and retain key employees."
But other employers, particularly smaller companies in low-margin businesses, may force their employees to swallow the increasing costs, or even stop offering health insurance altogether. In a survey of 506 small businesses released yesterday by the National Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and the Employee Benefits Research Institute, one in seven businesses with fewer than 100 employees said they would drop health insurance if their premiums increased by 10 percent.
Even when companies continue to offer health insurance, some workers facing higher premiums may decide to drop their coverage and join the 45 million Americans without insurance. Individuals who buy their own insurance are likely to be hit hard as well.
Many large employers are frustrated by the costs of the elaborate central administrative systems of many H.M.O.'s, and by the need to pay in advance for all their employees to be covered. Big companies are also de-emphasizing more flexible managed-care plans, known as point-of-service plans, that let employees visit doctors outside their H.M.O. network if they are willing to shoulder more costs.
Instead, companies are stepping up efforts to shift employees into preferred-provider organizations, plans that are much closer to old-fashioned fee-for-service insurance.
Preferred-provider organizations, or P.P.O.'s, are based on networks of doctors and hospitals that agree to reduced rates for their services. Employees can go to any doctor in the network without obtaining permission beforehand, and employers pay only when their workers use medical services. There were 89 million people in P.P.O's and 81.3 million in H.M.O.'s in July 1999, the latest count, according to the American Association of Health Plans, a managed-care industry group.
Sears, Roebuck is one company making P.P.O.'s more appealing. It is cutting P.P.O. deductibles by half to attract employees away from H.M.O.'s, said Liz Rossman, vice president for benefits at Sears. The company is also dropping about 30 of the 180 H.M.O.'s that it offered employees this year. About 87 percent of Sears employees are currently enrolled in H.M.O.'s.
Andersen Consulting said it was substituting a national P.P.O. from United Healthcare and a Blue Cross and Blue Shield network to replace 125 H.M.O.'s and a point-of-service plan. Geoff Kantor, head of benefits at Andersen, said the company expected "to use our money more effectively" with the change. He said the P.P.O. would also be more convenient for Andersen's 30,000 employees, who frequently travel far from their hometown H.M.O.'s.
Costly new drugs and rising prescription volumes account for much of the premium increases. At General Motors, for example, spending on drugs increased 20 percent last year, to $762 million, in its self-insured plans, and the company expects its pharmacy costs to continue rising at that rate, said Bruce Bradley, director of managed-care plans at G.M.
In addition to rising drug costs, insurers say that greater demand for other medical services, increasing hospital and physician fees and uncertainty about new laws regulating health care are all forcing them to raise rates, and making it impossible for them to commit themselves to premium rates for more than a year.
David Snow, executive vice president of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, said heavy investments in new technology and higher salaries to retain skilled employees were also adding to costs.
At the same time, however, profits of managed-care companies are rising slightly after losses in the mid-1990's, and a wave of insurance company mergers has reduced competition in many markets.
Several large employers said that 2001 would be the second consecutive year of double-digit increases in health care premiums. For many smaller companies, which generally face steeper rate increases, 2001 will bring their third annual increase of more than 10 percent.
This year, the employer's share of health benefits averages $4,911 for each employee with a family, according to John Cookson, a principal at Milliman & Robertson, an actuarial firm.
Health costs are "out of control," said Elyse Hanan, executive producer of Zap Edit, a film editing company with eight employees in Manhattan that absorbed double-digit premium increases in 1999 and this year. "I like the plan that I have, but it's a ridiculous amount of money," she said. If there is a third big increase next January, she added half-seriously, "the only doctor I'm going to be able to afford is my brother."
The Alltel Corporation, a wireless phone company with 26,000 employees, is absorbing most, but not all, of its premium increases. It is raising the employee payment for a visit to a doctor's office to a $20 maximum from $15, and adding a partial payment each time an employee checks into a hospital.
Joe Meyer, manager of corporate benefits planning at Alltel, said he had persuaded its H.M.O.'s to shave a few percentage points from the proposed increases, cutting the average increases to 15 percent from 17 percent. But he said many H.M.O.'s were reluctant to bargain. "They have a 'take it or leave it' attitude," he said.
The premium increases are not limited to a particular region. The nation's second-largest employee benefits provider, the California Public Employees Retirement System, said the rates its million members and their families would pay for basic H.M.O.'s with limited service options were rising 9.2 percent, while rates for preferred-provider groups were increasing 18.8 percent, and for Medicare H.M.O.'s, 31.7 percent.
Small and midsize employers face even steeper increases. In the Northwest, for example, their premiums will rise 15 to 30 percent next year, said Richard L. Woolworth, chief executive of the Regence Blue Cross and Blue Shield group in Oregon, Washington State, Idaho and Utah.
Premiums will rise 18 to 20 percent in Texas, 10 to 15 percent in St. Louis and close to 10 percent in New York for most large employers, and 14.5 percent for state employees in Massachusetts.
Larry Boress, executive director of the Chicago Business Group on Health, an employer group, said many employees had singled out point-of-service plans as a problem. One in six insured employees were in these plans last year, according to a survey by the William M. Mercer consulting firm. And employers called the plans "very expensive," Mr. Boress said.
Gail Marcus, a senior vice president of Cigna HealthCare, said that its 4.8 million-member P.P.O. was growing twice as fast as its H.M.O.'s and its point-of-service plans. But she said Cigna had not seen customers switching to preferred provider from other types of plans.
Oxford Health Plans still has 77 percent of its 1.45 million members in point-of-service hybrids, said Maria Shydlo, a spokeswoman for Oxford. Jill Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna U.S. Healthcare, said the company was adding flexible options to give members more choices. She said Aetna would be raising premium rates 13 percent next January.

HEADLINE: Gore's Campaign Releases Extensive Economic Blueprint

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Sept. 5

 BODY:
The Gore campaign today released a detailed economic blueprint for the next decade, including a new proposal for a $300 billion hedge against overly optimistic budget projections.
The document also reiterates the vice president's commitment to eliminate the national debt and lists a broad variety of socioeconomic goals -- like increasing home ownership, reducing poverty and narrowing the pay gap between men and women -- that he hopes to achieve through proposals he previously announced. 
 Mr. Gore's idea for a $300 billion reserve fund -- money that would not be spent from the federal budget surplus -- is intended to be a cushion against shortfalls in projections by the Congressional Budget Office, which estimates a surplus of $1.8 trillion over the next decade, exclusive of the surplus reaped by the Social Security system.
While the Gore and Bush campaigns both assume the $1.8 trillion projected by the C.B.O., the Clinton administration uses the more conservative estimate of the White House Office of Management and Budget: $1.4 trillion.
"If more conservative O.M.B. projections are met," the Gore blueprint says, "this will allow an additional $300 billion of debt reduction. If unexpected costs materialize, this surplus resource will prevent us from going back to the days of big deficits, high taxes and deep spending cuts."
Mr. Gore's plan otherwise synthesizes proposals that he has made over the last several months into a variety of national goals. He is to discuss it in a speech here on Wednesday, and details are being published in a 200-page book, unique in modern presidential campaigns in that it is essentially a budget proposal that will serve as an economic and political manifesto.
The number-heavy and footnoted book, which was made available to The New York Times, underscores Mr. Gore's determination to supply specifics in his policy proposals. In that regard, it is intended to serve as a counterweight to the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush, which the Gore camp regards as feather-thin on policy and based largely on personality.
The plan, which Gore advisers denied was timed to offset Mr. Bush's proposal today to overhaul Medicare, was drafted for months with help from Clinton administration experts like Robert E. Rubin, former treasury secretary; Laura D. Tyson, former chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers; and Gene Sperling, President Clinton's top economic adviser. Mr. Rubin is to join Mr. Gore for the presentation here on Wednesday.
The Gore campaign said its blueprint was the road to continued economic expansion. And realization of the goals that the vice president laid out, like reducing the poverty level to below 10 percent for the first time in history, and increasing the college graduation rate to 75 percent of high school graduates from the current level of 66 percent, depends on that continued prosperity.
The sum of Mr. Gore's spending initiatives, as presented by his campaign, is about $1.4 trillion, although Republicans said it appeared to them that his proposals would mean new spending that totaled more than the surplus of $1.8 trillion envisioned by the Congressional Budget Office. An analysis prepared by the Senate Budget Committee, headed by Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said Mr. Gore had proposed such extensive spending that he would have to dip into Social Security to pay for his programs.
The Gore campaign has also proposed targeted tax cuts that it says amount to $500 billion over 10 years. But Republicans say these are illusory and so complicated that no one can be sure how much anyone would save.
The Gore campaign said that its plan was sound and would eliminate the publicly held federal debt by 2012, while Mr. Bush's, it said, would leave the government $2.8 trillion in debt.
Indeed, the centerpiece of the Gore plan is to eliminate the debt, through use of Mr. Gore's proposed reserve fund and the Social Security and Medicare surpluses. Mr. Gore would protect those surpluses by barring their use for any other purpose.
One of the plan's socioeconomic goals is to double the number of families, to 65 million from 32 million, that have at least $50,000 in savings.
Other goals include lowering the income tax burden on the typical family to the lowest level in 50 years, reducing the poverty level to below 10 percent, raising the number of families who own homes to more than 70 percent, reducing the gap between what men and women earn by 50 percent and creating 10 million high-technology jobs.
To achieve those goals, the plan offers numerous tax credits and tax deductions for expenses like college, day care and long-term care, and to encourage savings.
The plan says that through increased productivity, a Gore administration could raise family incomes by one-third over the next decade. It estimates productivity growth at 2.8 percent a year, by paying down the debt, investing in biomedical research and computer technology, and opening more markets abroad.
His plan says Mr. Gore would reduce the poverty rate to below 10 percent by 2004 from its current level above 12 percent. He would achieve this by raising the minimum wage, expanding the earned-income tax credit and creating more welfare-to-work programs.
The plan also sets a goal of cutting the gap between pay for men and women.
Women now earn 73 cents for every dollar earned by men, according to the Council of Economic Advisers. The Gore plan would cut that gap of 27 cents by almost half, to 14 cents, through various plans that provide training programs to move women into higher-paying, high-tech jobs and more loans to help women start their own businesses.

 BODY:
The number of applicants to the nation's 125 medical schools fell for the third consecutive year in 1999, an annual survey by the American Medical Association shows.
The 38,529 applicants for last year's freshman class was down 6 percent from 1998, when there were 41,004 applicants. 
 The survey did not address reasons for the decline, though others have suggested that the nation's strong economy may be attracting potential applicants to other fields.

NEW YORK
 
MANHATTAN: POLICE LEADERS SWORN IN
Bernard B. Kerik was sworn in yesterday as New York City's 40th police commissioner, and he pledged to work to improve the Police Department's troubled relationship with the community and to develop a way to measure progress toward that goal. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani administered the oath to him and to the new first deputy commissioner, Joseph P. Dunne, in the presence of officials including United States Attorneys Mary Jo White of Manhattan and Loretta E. Lynch of Brooklyn, who are investigating possible civil rights abuses by the department. William K. Rashbaum (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: SUPPORT FOR CITY CASINO
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said during a news conference yesterday that he would welcome a casino in Manhattan built by Donald J. Trump or "anyone else" as long as there was no involvement with organized crime and the profits benefited New York City. Yesterday's New York Post quoted Mr. Trump as saying that he might work with an Indian tribe to develop "the world's largest casino" on the Upper West Side. Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge called the idea "preposterous" and said that Mr. Trump's "childish threat" was issued because he disliked the idea of a casino in the Catskills competing with his casinos in New Jersey. Elisabeth Bumiller (NYT) 

BRONX: MAN SLAIN IN APARTMENT
One man was shot dead and another critically injured in an apparent robbery attempt at an apartment, the police said. The shootings happened around 6:10 p.m. at 1370 Virginia Avenue in Parkchester, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman. One man, 31, died after being shot numerous times in the bathtub. The other man, 24, was in critical condition at Jacobi Medical Center, Detective Pentangelo said. Neither victim's name was released. It was not clear if anything was taken from the apartment, the detective said. The police found a large amount of an unspecified drug in the apartment, an investigator said. Andy Newman (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: SUBWAY PUSHER SEEMED 'NORMAL'
The man who pushed Edgar Rivera into the path of a subway train that severed both his legs seemed "normal," "clean" and "not drunk" at the time of his arrest, the arresting officer testified yesterday. The man identified as Mr. Rivera's attacker, Julio Perez, has a history of mental illness, and his mental health at the time of the incident is expected to be an important factor in his trial in the fall. The officer, Julio Agron, testified at a hearing in Manhattan Criminal Court that Mr. Perez admitted to pushing Mr. Rivera, but that his explanation was not particularly lucid. Katherine E. Finkelstein (NYT)
 
ALBANY: TOP ASSEMBLY AIDE QUITS
Patricia Lynch, the longtime press secretary for the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, is resigning as of January. Ms. Lynch, 42, who went to work for the speaker, Sheldon Silver, seven years ago, is considered one of the most influential people in state government. She helped shape political strategy for the 98 Democrats who make up the Assembly's majority. Raymond Hernandez (NYT)
 
CONNECTICUT
 
HARTFORD: STATE SURPLUS QUADRUPLES
A report on the state's fiscal health released yesterday by Gov. John G. Rowland's office put the surplus for fiscal year 2000's $11.6 billion budget at $300.4 million, more than four times the 1999 surplus. Most of it is scheduled to pay for school construction. The report also said that 21,000 nonagricultural jobs had been created between July 1999 and July 2000. The state's July unemployment rate, 2.4 percent, remained well below the 4 percent national average, the report said. Paul Zielbauer (NYT)
 
NEW JERSEY
 
TRENTON: FRANKS GETS POLICE ENDORSEMENT
Robert D. Franks, the Republican candidate for the United States Senate, has received the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, a union representing 14,000 New Jersey law enforcement officers. The union president, Richard Whelan, said yesterday that Mr. Franks's voting record during eight years as a representative from Union County supported tougher sentencing laws and an increase in the number of police officers. In accepting the endorsement, Mr. Franks noted that he supported the death penalty, unlike his Democratic opponent, Jon S. Corzine. David Kocieniewski (NYT)
 
HOBOKEN: RAIL PARTNERSHIP QUESTIONS
Transportation officials in Pennsylvania and New Jersey have yet to decide how to divide the costs of passenger rail service between Scranton and Hoboken, scheduled for 2004. Federal financing expected to arrive next month would pay 80 percent of the preliminary engineering costs, but the states must negotiate an agreement, subject to federal approval, to share the responsibility for capital and operating costs. The rail line would carry passengers from Scranton and three stations in Monroe County, Pa., across the Delaware River into Warren, Sussex and Morris Counties in New Jersey. Passengers could then take New Jersey Transit trains that are already in service to Hoboken. (AP)
 
TRENTON: BRATTON HIRED AS CONSULTANT
The former New York City police commissioner, William J. Bratton, brought his team of law enforcement consultants to Trenton yesterday to begin a 6- to 12-month, $134,000 review of the city's police. Mayor Douglas Palmer said the city had hired the group to cut crime, lift police morale and improve cooperation between law enforcement and civilians. Mr. Bratton said that his group would do a "cultural diagnostic, like a CAT scan," of staffing levels, union contracts and deployment practices of Trenton's 374-member department. Iver Peterson (NYT)
 
TRENTON: EXPERTS, LAWYERS AND VIDEOTAPE
Trying to get civil trials to court more quickly, a committee of the State Supreme Court issued rules effective yesterday that limit lawyers to one postponement when an expert witness is unavailable. Under the rule, after the postponement the expert's testimony may be given as scheduled on videotape, or not at all. Although videotaping has been allowed for 20 years, some lawyers oppose it, saying it is not as effective as live testimony. (NYT)

BYLINE: By Florence Fabricant 

 BODY:
Food for mind and body is on the menu in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, at the Read, 158 Bedford Avenue (North Eighth Street), a slightly threadbare but friendly used-book store and cafe. There, you might find an old copy of "Slaughterhouse-Five" by Kurt Vonnegut, to read while nibbling the chicken-walnut salad sandwich ($6) named after him. (Don't worry: the Melville sandwich features tuna, not whale.)
The cafe has tables for about 20, with some more in a garden in the back. It serves every espresso-based drink imaginable. A highlight among the desserts is fresh peach cobbler, $3.50. New periodicals are as diverse as The Economist, Self and Punk Planet. 
 The Read opens at 7 a.m. weekdays and 9 a.m. Saturday and Sunday, and stays open until 11 p.m. Monday through Wednesday, 2 a.m. Thursday through Saturday and 9 p.m. Sunday.

HEADLINE: MY JOB;
Handyman 101: English a Must

BYLINE: By MAREK PONICHTERA; Written with Marcin Skomial.

 BODY:
I set out for America 10 years ago with my new wife and $500 that I had borrowed from friends. My wife's uncle picked us up at Kennedy Airport. He was the only person we knew in this country -- and he was unemployed. My wife soon got a part-time job as a cleaning lady for a family in Brooklyn. I couldn't find work, so I helped her out. I did whatever I was told to do: sweeping the walk, washing windows, changing bulbs. As payment, we received free room and board, but no money. The family didn't speak Polish, but somehow we were able to communicate through sign language and an English-Polish dictionary that I always carried with me.
Finally, a year later, I got a job as a mason's helper at a construction site. I carried 50-pound loads of bricks around -- not easy, as I weigh about 140 pounds -- and I put in 10 to 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. My poor English was a worse disadvantage than ever. Once, a worker asked me to bring him a hammer. I nodded and fetched a screwdriver. He burst out laughing. 
 It was about then that I enrolled in a class to learn English. I also picked up other trade skills, and in 1992 I got a job doing carpentry, electrical work and painting.
Two years later, I was hired as superintendent of a residential building on West 85th Street. The pay and free housing seemed like a good deal, but I quickly realized I had my work cut out for me. I was responsible for the whole building, and anyone who needed something done in his apartment called me to do it.
Once, on a Sunday evening when I was getting ready to go out to a movie with my wife, my intercom started ringing. Someone had a leak in his apartment and the water had dripped into the apartment underneath. It took me two hours to solve that problem, and when I got back to our apartment, my wife handed me a sheet of paper with two other assignments: in both cases, a toilet had gotten clogged and the tenant was in desperate need of a plunger.
In 1995, my boss asked me to supervise the renovation of apartments at a much larger building he owned on West 90th Street. Although my title was still superintendent, I no longer had to deal with leaks and clogged toilets. I hired a porter to take care of those chores, while I sat in my office in the basement, ordering paint and Sheetrock and hiring workers, mostly newly arrived Poles who couldn't speak English.
Once, my boss started shouting at a group of them unloading steel pipes from a truck to work faster. They ignored him. When I saw what was happening, I hurried to explain to him that none of them understood a word he was saying.
Sometimes, I am surprised at how rude people can be. Perfect strangers will make disdainful comments about my work clothes, which are often spattered with paint, for example.
One Sunday, when my porter was off duty, a lady asked me to come to her apartment immediately to fix her air-conditioner. While I was working, she asked me about my family and background. At some point, she started to express dissatisfaction with my Polish accent and the fact that I came from a formerly Communist country. It didn't seem to matter to her that she herself came from Romania -- and had a Romanian accent.

HEADLINE: Stepping Aside at an Operatic Oasis;
Founding Director of the Santa Fe Opera Looks Back on 43 Years of Innovation

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M.

 BODY:
The costumes, props and scenery used in the Santa Fe Opera's five summer productions are being packed for storage, and the singers and choristers who held the spotlight are en route to their next engagements. But as the company's backstage staff wraps up the loose ends, a more figurative curtain is descending, slowly and gracefully, on a long stretch of the company's history. On Sept. 30, just as the new concert season gets under way in the world's arts centers, John Crosby will step down as the general director of this adventurous company, which he founded in 1957 and has run since.
Having built an opera house in the middle of the Southwestern desert and quickly established it as an important stop on the summer festival circuit, Mr. Crosby, 74, will turn over the reins to Richard Gaddes. As the associate general director for the last five years, Mr. Gaddes has been Mr. Crosby's right-hand man; and as the founder of a similar venture in St. Louis, he knows about running an opera company. He has invited Mr. Crosby to return to conduct Strauss operas, his specialty, next summer and in 2002. Otherwise Mr. Crosby is to exert no influence on the company. 
 "I think when you stop, you stop," Mr. Crosby said, speaking barely above a whisper throughout an interview in his office on the company's grounds here. "I think it's very important that you recognize that you can't manage in the background. You can't be breathing down somebody's neck."
That is not to say that relinquishing the company will be easy.
"Sometimes I think I haven't thought about anything else for 45 years," he said. "I fall asleep worrying about it and wake up worrying about it."
That worrying led to the creation of something unusual and, even today, slightly out of place here. The highway that runs past the company's grounds on a hill overlooking Santa Fe is otherwise known for casinos, Indian pueblos and glorious views of desert plateaus. A sign marks the company's home as a local landmark, yet some 65 percent of its audience comes from outside New Mexico. The company has mixed feelings about the imbalance, which Mr. Gaddes said he would like to redress.
A visitor to the company's comfortable, technologically up-to-date theater might not fully appreciate how daring was Mr. Crosby's notion of establishing a company here when he began contemplating it in the early 1950's. The wide highway that connects Albuquerque, the closest major airport, to Santa Fe was then a rustic two-lane road, and the drive that now takes 50 minutes took two and a half hours. More to the point, Santa Fe itself was not clamoring for an opera company. But Mr. Crosby said it had the kind of audience that would support one.
"First of all, and very important, Santa Fe had a long history of what I like to call hospitality to the arts," said Mr. Crosby, who was born in New York but began visiting Santa Fe as a child because its dry climate was good for his asthma. "It was a community that had a flourishing art colony, if you will: painters, poets, writers, sculptors. And strangely, from that galaxy of the arts, music was rather missing. So it seemed to me that the community would receive this missing link warmly.
"The second thing was, you have to try and remember how different the world of classical music was in the summertime in the 1950's. It was nothing by comparison to today. So there was an abundance of unemployed classical music talent, both vocal and instrumental. Goodness, in our first season I think probably one-third of our orchestra was from the Metropolitan Opera. They had two choices, either to stay home and paint the house, or put the kids in the car and come out to Santa Fe for the summer."
He assembled a company of 65 performers for his first season, which opened with "Madama Butterfly" on July 3, 1957, just a few days short of his 31st birthday. The budget that summer was $110,000, about $60,000 of which he had raised in donations, with the rest covered largely by ticket sales. For the season just ended the company had a payroll of 550 and a budget of $11 million.
Its home has expanded as well. Its first house was a 480-seat open air theater, which burned down in 1967. A theater seating 1,890 served the company for 30 years and was replaced in 1998 by a new 2,130-seat house designed by James Stewart Polshek and Partners of New York.
The company's real attraction, though, is its programming. Although it by no means neglected the standard repertory, contemporary and rarely staged works -- from Handel to Henze -- have won it an international audience. An early coup of Mr. Crosby's was persuading Igor Stravinsky to oversee the production of his "Rake's Progress" during the company's first season.
"I felt that it would not make sense to try to run a museum of opera in a small mountain town like Santa Fe," Mr. Crosby said. "You can have all the 'Bohemes' and 'Carmens' you want in New York all winter, with brilliant international casts, and you don't have to come here to see them. But if you have an interest in some unusual things, then you will come along."
All told the company offered nearly 50 world and American premieres during Mr. Crosby's tenure, including works by Hindemith, Hans-Werner Henze (his "Venus and Adonis" this year was his sixth work to be given its United States premiere by the company), Gian-Carlo Menotti, Krzysztof Penderecki, Martin David Levy, Carlisle Floyd, Peter Lieberson, David Lang, Judith Weir and Tobias Picker.
Schoenberg's "Jakobsleiter" and "Von Heute auf Morgen," Shostakovich's "Nose" and several rarely heard Strauss operas also had their first American performances here. So did a pair of Baroque operas by Cavalli. And because the company gave the American premiere of the two-act version of Berg's "Lulu" in 1963, it was given the right to stage the American premiere of the full work in 1979, after the third act was belatedly published.
"Santa Fe has been a huge influence on the American opera scene, the way Glyndebourne influences opera in England, and Aix-en-Provence influences opera in France," said Matthew Epstein, the artistic director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago and for the last 20 years a consultant in Santa Fe as well. "You walk across the deck here on a summer evening, and you see the movers and shakers of the opera world. And when an opera has been a success here, it is suddenly looked at by other companies."
This has also been a good place to spot singers whose careers are about to take off. James Morris, Sherrill Milnes, Faith Esham, Ashley Putnam, Neil Shicoff, Judith Blegen and Brent Ellis all participated in the apprentice program for young singers. So did David Gockley, who is now the director of the Houston Grand Opera. Jose Van Dam, Kiri Te Kanawa and Bryn Terfel all made their American debuts here, and Benita Valente, Frederica von Stade, Hakan Hagegard, Catherine Malfitano, Maria Ewing, Thomas Hampson, Ben Heppner and Susan Graham had starring roles here early in their careers.
"When I was in college at Texas Tech in Lubbock, I used to drive up and get standing-room tickets," said Ms. Graham, who grew up not far from here, in Roswell. "It was my first exposure to professional opera, and it really did help define my dream."
Ms. Graham, a mezzo-soprano who has built an international career since her first performances here in 1989, has sung in several of the Strauss productions conducted by Mr. Crosby.
"He's not a man who likes to call a lot of attention to himself," she said of his rehearsal manner. "He won't yell, won't holler over stage noise. But he knows how he wants to approach every nuance in the Strauss operas, and he gave me a lot of input on interpretation and emotional matters. He never says more than a sentence at a time, but those sentences are densely packed with information. You have to listen carefully."
There is a sense of confidence here about the company's future. For one thing, there is not much mystery about Mr. Gaddes. He began working here as an artistic administrator in 1969 but left to found the Opera Theater of St. Louis in 1976. There are many similarities between the Santa Fe and St. Louis companies; both perform in the summer and present a similar repertory mixture.
"That was not a coincidence," Mr. Gaddes said. "I always say that John Crosby sired the Opera Theater of St. Louis. The whole concept was modeled on Santa Fe, and part of the idea was that the apprentices here would feed into St. Louis. Which they did."
Mr. Gaddes returned to Santa Fe in 1988, first as a consultant, then as associate general director, a title that Mr. Crosby said was meant to give him authority but not necessarily to make him his chosen successor. That decision, he said, was the board's.
Mr. Gaddes seems intent on maintaining many of the traditions that Mr. Crosby has established. Among the works he has announced for next season are Berg's "Wozzeck," Strauss's "Egyptian Helen" and a Mozart rarity, "Mitridate." He has commissioned new works from Aaron Jay Kernis, Bright Sheng and Kaija Saariaho and is bringing in the director Peter Sellars.
Mr. Crosby is keeping his own plans to himself. He has given up the New York residence he maintained for many years, and will split his time between Santa Fe and Palm Springs, Calif. And he is thinking about writing what he calls "a journal" about the company.
"It's not a book," he said. "I'm not a writer, and I don't want to try to be. But there are some wonderful little tales of the early days that are not known, and I have the feeling that if I put them down, they might serve some purpose 10, 20 or 30 years down the line, if someone wants to write a history of the institution."
Beyond that, the only activity he said was on his agenda was driving around in the silver Rolls-Royce convertible he bought last year. A visitor noted that a convertible seemed an odd choice for someone living in a climate where a half-hour's drive is likely to take one through four short rainstorms.
"Yes, that's true," he said. "But I so much enjoy pulling the top down that I do it too frequently. It's an old one, a 1985, and I had to do a lot of work on it. But it will outlive me; that's all I care about. And you see that's something I can do: I can spend my time washing it."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Turning the Tables, the Establishment Takes On Hip-Hop

BYLINE: By JULIE SALAMON

 BODY:
Robert Krulwich, a "Nightline" correspondent, shows a group of teenagers a snapshot of Al Gore and draws a collective blank. Then he pulls out a photograph of Russell Simmons, a corporate executive. Instant recognition all around!
If you do know who Al Gore is, you may not know that Mr. Simmons was one of the founders of Def Jam Records, the rap music label. He is also chairman of Rush Communications, whose holdings include Phat Farm. With these overlapping music and fashion franchises, you could call Mr. Simmons the C.E.O. of hip-hop. 
 In his three-part impressionistic series on hip-hop for "Nightline," Mr. Krulwich almost immediately establishes himself as a Gore-recognizing fogy. He begins his wry report with the image of the rapper LL Cool J grinning from his limousine at his enthusiastic fans in New York, who include a fawning policeman. "LL Cool J has been famous for 15 years, or that is what I'm told, because frankly I am not a rap fan and I am a little old," declares Mr. Krulwich. Later he says with puzzlement, "If you're over 40, this world's a mystery."
But the music that came shouting defiantly out of the ghetto 25 years ago has become a huge international business, and economics is one of Mr. Krulwich's reportorial specialties. So he plunges in -- or rather, saunters in, approaching his subject in the deliberately confounded style of Peter Falk as the eccentric detective on "Columbo." (That series went off the air in 1977, just as rap was taking hold.)
On tonight's episode, "Hip-Hop Grows Up," using Mr. Simmons and his Phat Farm as the centerpiece, Mr. Krulwich slyly demonstrates how roaring capitalist success has harnessed this revolutionary form of gangster-celebrating music (or co-opted it, depending on your point of view).
Mr. Simmons began his career 20 years ago as a young man promoting raucous parties in the Bronx. Now, at 42, he has become a caricature of a nouveau riche mogul. He has a much younger -- and, of course, fabulous-looking -- wife, the 23-year-old fashion model and television hostess Kimora Lee. He shops with The Robb Report, which specializes in brands like Boucheron and Cartier ("ridiculously lavish" brands, to use Mr. Krulwich's description). He denies his own fallibility, as rich people tend to. "What do you mean my body's going to change shape?" he responds defiantly when Mr. Krulwich asks him if, as a trendsetter for people ages 15 to 25, he's worried about growing older and wider. Luckily, Phat Farm's baggy hip-hop fashions give middle-aged men plenty of deniability in the love-handles arena.
Mr. Krulwich captures the supreme self-confidence and accessibility that has helped Mr. Simmons acquire a net worth of $200 million. As supremely self-confident people do, he has a trademark outfit -- a baseball cap and sparkling Adidas, even when he's otherwise dressed in more-or-less conventional evening clothes. Yet when young recording star hopefuls greet him at the elevator in his sleek corporate office building, he listens politely to their rap and takes their demo tapes. He met Kevin Leong, the 23-year-old former graffiti artist who is now Phat Farm's chief clothing designer, on the elevator. (Mr. Leong is featured in the third episode.)
On camera, as Mr. Krulwich follows him through his workday, Mr. Simmons is breezily arrogant, as if he had been bred in Hollywood instead of in Hollis, Queens, by middle-class teachers. Asked him why a white 50-year-old banker in Des Moines isn't hip-hop, Mr. Simmons replies dismissively -- and quickly because he's about to pick up the phone (again): "You are going to buy at Old Navy, you're going to be corny, you ain't got no flavor, you don't know what's new and hot."
Mr. Krulwich, whose fashion preference is the rumpled look, gives Mr. Simmons's emphasis on clothes and on what's "new and hot" a friendly sociological spin. "Hip-hop culture was born in poor neighborhoods where people dream of owning things that instantly confer status -- the right clothes, hot logos, brand names," he observes.
But he does seem to wince when a clothing designer describes the Simmonses' personal extravagance as an important marketing tool for Phat Farm. Becoming what you buy, the designer explains, is "the American dream." The correspondent says dubiously, "Well, it's an American dream."
Showing how enmeshed rap has become in the culture, the issue of rap-related violence doesn't emerge until Part 2, to be shown tomorrow night. Listening to the lyrics of a Jay-Z song about rough sex with a prostitute and murder, Mr. Krulwich says, "I find this music offensive."
But for the cagey reporter, stating an opinion is just another way of opening an inquiry. Lyor Cohen, Mr. Simmons's partner in Def Jam Records and the son of Israeli parents, says that Mr. Krulwich should find the music offensive because destroying the establishment is a time-honored tradition in music.
That acknowledged, Mr. Krulwich still distinguishes rap from other once-revolutionary forms of music like rock 'n' roll, jazz and ragtime. He questions the merits of rap lyrics that are often dirty and graphically violent. "How could this have any lasting value?" he asks. (You'll have to watch the program to learn the answer. The second half of Part 2 wasn't available for screening.)
This is an amicable investigation, however, so in Friday's episode Mr. Krulwich also manages to find a quiet, poignant figure in the highly charged, materialistic hip-hop world. Joseph Sadler, known as Grand Master Flash, was the man who found his calling in the breaks between the grooves in records. For three years in the 1970's he sat in his room spinning records, composing riffs that could be tucked inside the beat. He developed "scratching," an improvisational style that became intrinsic to hip-hop music. There was no money in it then, just an idea about music. Imagine that.

HEADLINE: NATIONAL ORIGINS: CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY;
Where the Mountains Are Almonds

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: HURON, Calif.

 BODY:
THEY are among the oldest cultivated foods on earth, the stuff of Greek myths, a prized ingredient of the pharaohs' breads, a staple of Biblical feasts. They are believed to have originated in China and Central Asia, and their pinkish white blossoms and graceful branches call to mind the cherry trees whose botanical family they share. Transported to the Mediterranean by the traders of the Silk Road, they have been an important commodity since the Middle Ages.
But here in the flat, hot, rich farmlands of California's Central Valley, almonds are nothing so much as big business. The state's 6,000 growers produce more than 600 million pounds a year, more than 70 percent of the world's supply and virtually 100 percent of domestic production. Almonds far outpace wine, oranges, apples and raisins as the United States' top horticultural export, worth close to $800 million annually. Eat marzipan in Germany or almonds salted in the shell like ballpark peanuts in India or China, and odds are high the nuts came from California. 
 These late summer weeks are crunch time in the long, endless groves. The fruit has ripened, its outer gray-greenish hull has cracked open to reveal a pale, crackly perforated inner shell, inside which a jewel is nestled: the moistly crunchy, brown-skinned nut itself. The harvest, from early August to Halloween, is a 7-day-a-week, 24-hour-a-day affair, as growers rush to get their crop hulled and shelled, packed and shipped before the fall rains make the groves a soggy mess.
The groves are vast, more like factories than farms, stretching up the spine of the state for 400 miles. Though the landscape is broken by the occasional cottonwood tree, it is not a place of roadside stands. Here the tomatoes lie in great heaps waiting to be processed into paste, and cotton grows in endless seas. There are no mom-and-pop shops with bags of almonds, the way one finds paper sacks of boiled peanuts in Georgia. Even a family farm, like Chris Woolf's, is an industrial sort of operation. The tidy farm lunchroom, a small building with whitewashed walls, Mexican tile floors and Fiestaware plates, does not feature almonds on the menu.
Time was, workers walked the groves tapping trees with tall poles to shake the fruit to the ground. Now an armada of diesel-powered mechanical shaking machines (one leading model is the Shock Wave Shaker) grip trees with rubber-coated hydraulic pincers, creating custom-made mini-earthquakes of trembling trunks and branches and hailstorms of falling nuts up and down the orchard rows.
"What do you compare that to?" asked Stacey Kollmeyer, the communications manager of the Almond Board of California and a third-generation almond hand, as the ground rumbled and a tornado of dust rose from a shaking Sonora almond tree on the Woolfs' farm here the other day. "It's like the tree's being electrocuted."
Mr. Woolf, 38, is the very model of a modern major almond grower, producing something on the order of six million pounds of nut meat a year on a couple of thousand acres of family-owned and leased land about an hour southwest of Fresno, just off Interstate 5 in the San Joaquin Valley. His family has been farming almonds (and cotton, tomatoes, pistachios, garlic, onions and oranges) since 1973, and now has a full, vertically integrated operation, starting with an almond nursery of some 300,000 seedlings and ending with a processing plant (owned in partnership with the Harris cattle ranching family) that hulls, shells and ships about 20 million pounds a year, most of it for direct overseas export.
"It's just so important not to have a breakdown at this time of year," Mr. Woolf said as he checked in with Jose Jimenez, a worker operating a new $95,000 shaker, one of six in the Woolf family fleet, from inside its compact, air-conditioned cab.
A graduate of the University of California at Berkeley, with a degree in history, Mr. Woolf also has an M.B.A. in agribusiness from the University of Santa Clara, and is what's known in the trade as a handler, one of about 100 growers officially responsible for recording the weight and quality of growers' almonds, collecting assessments for the Almond Board; his farm also serves as a site where the United States Agriculture Department's inspectors assess the crop. He is also in the middle of a one-year term as chairman of the Almond Board, created in 1950 to help market almonds.
As such, Mr. Woolf is squarely astride what has amounted to an explosion in the California almond crop. Almonds were first brought to the state in the 18th century, by the Franciscan padres who founded the chain of coastal missions, but the trees suffered in the misty, moist conditions near the Pacific, and only a hundred later were successfully planted inland.
The Central Valley has been prime almond terrain for most of the 20th century, but the crop has quadrupled over the last 30 years as efficient production, ideal growing conditions, economies of scale and growing demand for almonds in everything from breakfast cereal to specialty oils has given the state a virtual corner on the world market, with countries like Spain, Italy and Greece together producing not even a third of California's yield.
Anne Gingrass, the chef at Hawthorne Lane in San Francisco, uses almonds year-round, and in ways that are not always obvious. In a risotto with dried red chilies and goat cheese, she chops up almonds and cooks them with the rice so they attain a similar texture as the grains, and, she added, they round out the flavor and heat of the chilies. She also uses them to thicken chicken soup, pureeing the almonds with the broth.
"Hazelnuts are so strong, pine nuts are unpredictable -- you don't know if you're going to get a bad one, and they're really fatty," she said. "Almonds are subtle."
Almonds, long promoted in culinary lore as a hedge against intoxication if eaten with wine, have also benefited from a recent wave of nutritional and dietary revisionism. Like all nuts, they are high in fat, but mostly in mono-unsaturated fat, the kind that predominates in canola and olive oils and avocados, and is celebrated for its ability to lower harmful cholesterol. Several current diets, like the Zone, by Barry Sears, celebrate almonds for their satiating qualities and their ability to help satisfy cravings for less healthy fats. Almonds contain beneficial calcium, potassium and magnesium, all protections against high blood pressure. They are also potent sources of anti-oxidants, which have been linked to protection against cancer and heart disease.
An ounce of almonds, about 24 whole nuts, has 164 calories.
An almond tree in commercial production today begins with a hardy root stock grown from a peach pit (another botanical relative), onto which a more delicate almond cutting is grafted. Trees can begin producing nuts in about five years (two or three years shorter than pistachios) and reach peak productivity at about 10 years, which tapers off to almost nothing by age 25 or so. The annual production cycle -- and forecast of the year's yield -- begins romantically around Valentine's Day with the bloom, when orchards are transformed into spectacular oceans of pale pink blossoms.
Because almonds are not self-pollinating, different varieties are planted in alternating rows, and more than a million beehives are brought by commercial beekeepers into the state each winter to pollinate trees. It is a fraught time, and a whole year's crop depends on the vagaries of wind and weather.
"The bees won't fly if it rains," Mr. Woolf said, talking of this year's spotty bloom, which is expected to produce a crop about 25 percent below last year's record yield. "They won't fly if it's under 54 degrees. We knew we'd have a lower crop."
Once the nuts have been shaken to the ground, another set of machines, a bit like street sweepers, blow and rake them into neat rows between the trees, and still others with whirling rubber-toothed paddles come and pick them up into a wagon. They are taken to the Harris-Woolf processing plant nearby and piled in like batches, covered with plastic sheeting and fumigated.
Then comes the hulling and shelling, which is the province of Dean Nelson, a former banker from Arizona who used to handle the Woolf family account and decided a few years ago to return to his roots as a Utah farm boy by coming to run the almond plant. It's a spiffy operation, worthy of Rube Goldberg, in which the almonds move along a series of elevators and conveyors, under rollers and over shaking perforated trays with a series of successively finer holes. Nothing (except dust) gets wasted. First the hulls are cracked off completely and piled in giant mounds to be hauled off as a feed supplement for dairy cattle.
Then the brittle, almost papery inner shells are cracked and separated, in part using air blasts and suction. They become livestock bedding. Finally, the brown nuts fall through a series of slots to be sized, graded, weighed and, ultimately, packed for shipment in 2,000-pound wood containers or 50-pound cardboard boxes. The plant's annual electric bill is about $130,000, most of it racked up in the hundred days of harvest.
The biggest problem is, as Mr. Nelson puts it: "Every time you move an almond, you take a chance of chipping it up." The chipped ones fetch less at market, and go for products from candy bars to blanched almonds for baking and cooking. The unscarred nuts are reserved for snacking and fancy use, with the most popular variety -- -- the nonpareil, the fat, perfectly shaped nut in a can of smoked almonds or atop a fine pastry -- accounting for nearly 40 percent of California's total production.
Some of the nuts hulled at Harris-Woolf are bound for shipment to Blue Diamond, the giant cooperative that handles about 35 percent of all the state's production and is the single largest processor. Most are sent directly to brokers for sale.
The big growth market at the moment is China, which now accounts of 25 percent of American export sales and now buys more than 25 million pounds a year. So the almond growers are thrilled at the prospect of lower tariffs once China enters the World Trade Organization.
Mr. Woolf may sell globally, but he still grows locally, something he made clear as he walked a row of ripening trees the other day.
"It's not rocket science," he said, "but a lot of farming is just checking. The best sign of management is seeing the owner's footprints in the dirt."
 
ALMOND PLUM TARTS
Adapted from "New Food Fast," by Donna Hay (Whitecap Books, 1999)
Time: 35 minutes
 
 1/2 cup blanched whole almonds
4 small plums or apricots
4 ounces (1 stick) butter, at room temperature
 1/2 cup superfine sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
Lightly sweetened whipped cream, for garnish.
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Using a food processor, chop almonds until finely ground; do not allow to become a paste. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Cut a small cross into stem end of each plum, and remove pit; set plums aside.
2. In bowl of food processor, combine butter and sugar. Process until smooth. Add eggs, vanilla, flour and ground almonds. Process until just combined.
3. Divide almond mixture among four 1-cup pudding or souffle dishes. Press a plum, cut side up, into center of batter; a portion of the plum will remain above the batter.
4. Bake until filling is puffed and golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Garnish tarts with a dollop of whipped cream. Serve immediately.
Yield: 4 servings.
 
ALMOND-AND-HAZELNUT-CHIP MACAROONS
Adapted from "Desserts: Mediterranean Flavors, California Style,"
by Cindy Mushet (Scribner, 2000)
Time: 1 hour
 
 2/3 cup whole hazelnuts, shelled
2 cups whole natural almonds, shelled
1 1/4 cups sugar
2 to 3 large egg whites
2 tablespoons apricot jam
1 teaspoon minced lemon zest.
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Spread hazelnuts across baking sheet, and bake until skins are lightly browned, about 5 minutes; do not turn off oven. Roll nuts in a clean kitchen towel. Pressing lightly on towel, roll back and forth to loosen skins of nuts. Transfer skinned nuts to a food processor. Chop until nuts are the size of chocolate chips. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
2. Spread almonds on a baking sheet and bake until lightly browned, about 5 minutes; remove from heat. Reduce oven to 350 degrees. Allow nuts to cool, and place in bowl of a food processor. Add sugar, and process until almonds are very finely ground, 30 to 40 seconds. Add 2 egg whites, jam and lemon zest. Pulse until blended; mixture should be thick and tacky when pressed with fingertip. If dry, add a teaspoon of remaining egg white, and pulse; repeat if necessary to reach desired consistency.
3. Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Add hazelnuts, and knead by hand until blended. Lightly wet hands to prevent sticking. Divide dough in half, then divide each half into 8 pieces, for a total of 16 pieces. Shape pieces into balls, and place eight balls on each of two parchment-lined baking sheets.
4. Position oven racks in top and center thirds of oven. Bake macaroons until golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes, reversing baking sheets from front to back and top to bottom halfway through cooking time. Store for up to one week in an airtight container, or freeze for up to one month.
Yield: Sixteen 3-inch macaroons.

 CORRECTION:
A word was omitted last Wednesday from an article in this section about almond farming in California. The affected sentence should have read, "Almonds were first brought to the state in the 18th century, by the Franciscan padres who founded the chain of coastal missions, but the trees suffered in the misty, moist conditions near the Pacific, and only a hundred years later were successfully planted inland."

HEADLINE: DESIGN NOTEBOOK;
Life on Earth (Condensed)

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
READING the telephone book used to be a joke until List magazine, also exclusively a collection of lists, appeared in June. Four thousand copies later (at $15 a pop), the new magazine's last laugh is the next item on the editors' list: Issue 2 arrives in October. The white pages, at least, are free.
Detractors and admirers -- and List's creative directors, Lisa Ano, 28, and Serge Becker, 39, who are designers by background -- like to think of List as a kind of literary Armageddon: the arguments of the traditional magazine piece stripped to a corrosive litany of disinterested facts. It might be a perfect model for the new popular magazine: you can't do anything but skim it. 
 In 40 lists, List/01 includes topics that are better listed than explained (supermodel day rates), topics explained by their listing (international illiteracy rates) and topics explained in a list (death row inmates' last meals: John Wayne Gacy ate four courses of fried foods, with fresh strawberries for dessert).
Ms. Ano and Mr. Becker create List at Can Resources, an architecture and design company, where they work with Derek Sanders, 39, an architect, on projects like the new Standard hotel in Los Angeles. Ms. Ano, a graphic designer, previously assisted Tibor Kalman at M&Co. Mr. Becker, a restaurant and club entrepreneur -- List is his idea -- is a list maker from way back, as in guest lists and A-lists. He helped create MK, Bowery Bar and Joe's Pub. With a resume that lopes like a velvet rope, Mr. Becker understands the power of exclusivity, from the F.B.I.'s 10 Most Wanted list to Tina Brown's "Talk Magazine Launch" Liberty Island party list: he published both in List. New York publicists have undoubtedly shuffled them. Recognition is its own reward.
Visited at its Chinatown offices, two flights above a sewing shop, List previewed its next proudly engineered controversy -- List/02 -- an advertorial vehicle created instead as "edvertisements."
The magazine will portray 12 personalities, like Bryce P. Wilson, a music producer, and Lizzie Grubman, a publicist, in visual lists or trademark collages based on the brand-name products they consume, excerpted from responses to a 138-item questionnaire on items from art to underwear. Makers of the products listed will be invited, the editors said, to sponsor the magazine by paying a $3,500 fee for a more adlike depiction of the product. It is either a bold sales call or a sly social comment. Mr. Becker, unsurprisingly, said it was both -- a Trojan horse with viewing balconies. List/02 has to pay its way, or it's history.
"We Are All Lucky," a vertical list of Chinese characters left by the last tenant, was the only sign on List's door.
 
Q: Name two things you used to do that you don't do anymore.
 
DEREK: Smoke cigarettes.
 
SERGE: Smoke cigarettes.
 
LISA: Ever?
 
DEREK: Oh -- steal.
 
LISA: Oh! Me, too.
 
SERGE: Me, too!
 
LISA: That's No. 1. Thank you. That was a major issue.
 
SERGE: Shoplifting -- big teenage sport.
 
DEREK: Good consumers at an early age -- we had an eye.
 
Q: Why lists?
 
SERGE: It seemed pure. Very much of the moment. We have less time right now. They're really easy to kind of glance at. What about a magazine that condenses everything down to lists? You pick it up, you check out one or two, you put it down. You pick it up again. It dispenses with the articles concept.
 
Q: How did you come up with the lists?
 
LISA: Calls, calls, calls.
 
SERGE: First, we made a list. (Laughter all around.) Blacklist, wish list, A-list, to-do list. Then wordplays, like socialist, capitalist. The idea was that it could be a very collaborative magazine. You can't ask everybody to contribute an article, but you can ask a lot of people to contribute a list. Lists can be very boring, but then, a really good list is a really great snapshot that really captures the moment. A little bit like the cover. (Mr. Becker's 1-year-old daughter, Georgia, is pictured in the arms of her mother, Jodie Patterson-Becker: the first item on their family list.)
 
Q: Is a magazine of lists with a paying readership a good or a bad thing?
 
SERGE: I read The New Yorker. List doesn't replace a really great researched long-form article. There's not that many great ones written anyway. There's so much fluff in magazines. This is cool information that's actually useful.
 
Q: How has an architectural office come to publish a magazine? Is List really a design magazine?
 
SERGE: I studied communication design in Switzerland. My career at that point was supposed to be advertising. I hated it. I came here, got into nightclubs, started designing them.
 
Q: Why nightclubs?
 
SERGE: New York was the city of Studio 54. Clubs were a vital part of the culture. It's changed. The moment has passed. The people drawn from the creative world to clubs are focusing on fields like the Internet. I started designing other places and got into architecture. Derek and I worked together on the Mercer Hotel. As you get older, you don't want to be in nightclubs anymore. I had to create a day job for myself.
 
Q: Design's such a trendy subject right now, from hotels to Web sites. Is it this generation's new club scene?
 
DEREK: There's a glut almost.
 
SERGE: Design is fashion now. It spreads really fast, because there's so much media that translate these ideas. From the time it's a germ until it's some mass product in everybody's house, everybody's mind, that time lag is so short. These things move like viruses through the culture.
 
DEREK: We're talking about something as simple as the radius curve that you started to see.
 
SERGE: It started in furniture. Then it went into graphics. One minute it's in Wallpaper -- the next minute it's at Urban Outfitters. The next minute . . .
 
LISA: Centro-fly.
 
DEREK: I think our conversations are a little anti-design sometimes.
 
SERGE: It's not just dealing with the form and the shapes of things anymore. List is about pure content, and a lot of the design work that we do is really a little bit like production design, about scripting -- an environment idea that fits a particular purpose, then creating a set for it.
 
DEREK: The attempt is to get a little bit of longevity out of design -- in creating a place that moves you. You go there, to feel that. It's not a radius curve that you get tired of.
 
SERGE: We're going through such a transformation of our information culture -- all these new technologies. They always bring too much to you. When you first get a cell phone, you're constantly on the stupid phone. Gradually, you realize, hey -- I can turn this off. It's the same way with design now: how much design do we really need? I like the new Jasper Morrison low-pad chair. Do I need it? Is it exciting? Is it what I want to do with my life? Absolutely, no.
 
DEREK: We're still in the infatuation phase with the technology. You take like Frank Gehry, infatuated with creating shape with it. It's still new. I think you'll get past that, into something more content-driven.
 
Q: What's next then?
 
SERGE: Design becomes less dogmatic, less one style ruling all and more niche, niche, niche. More people doing their own thing.
 
Q: But do most of us, after 50 years of commercial television, international advertising strategies and global brands, really have our own identities to draw upon? Or will individual design just be an assembly of prefabricated parts? A shoplifter's list?
 
LISA: It's the theme of our next issue.
 
SERGE: How we construct personalities as consumers -- all the consumer choices that people make.
 
LISA: From clothes to water.
 
SERGE: The car they drive, the toothpaste they use. We tried to look at our own lives: what we use, how we make decisions. Do you ever ask yourself that?
 
LISA: All the time.
 
DEREK: All the time! (Laughter all around.)
 
SERGE: When you look at the magazine, you'll think, "Where are the ads?" The magazine is the ad. We won't have a single page of real advertising, but companies will pay for our endorsement, when we show their product, in a personality's profile.
 
Q: That doesn't seem particularly provocative, or new. Michael Jordan wears Nikes -- we know that.
 
SERGE: But Jordan is paid to wear Nikes. The value of our endorsement is different: it's true. Real people are saying they really use the product. That's at least as valuable as an ad, to an advertiser.
 
Q: Is it still possible to be in love?
 
SERGE: Yes.
 
LISA: Definitely.
 
Q: Is anyone at the table in love?
 
SERGE: I am.
 
LISA: No.
 
Q: Name two people you admire.
 
DEREK: Muhammad Ali and Rem Koolhaas.
 
SERGE: I have to say Rem. It's the first thing that came to my mind. He doesn't make value judgments. He deals with a lot of what we've been talking about. He embraces these changes that are coming.
 
Q: O.K., that's one.
 
LISA: I'm totally blank. I can only think of my mother right now.
 
SERGE: I'm trying to think of a person that I find inspiring, in terms of helping people get past these doubts, all these daunting changes that are constantly assaulting us, that can inspire you to say, "No it's not getting worse, it's getting better," and have trust in that. I met Nelson Mandela, when he got out of jail and came to New York. He had dinner at TriBeCa Grill. I was totally blown away by his example, but then, I look at his country. Maybe it isn't enough, the idea that one person can do it all.
 
Q: Is globalization a good or a bad thing?
 
DEREK: It's not good or bad -- it's just happening.
 
SERGE: We're becoming members of, not ethnic tribes, but cultural tribes, that have their equivalent all around the globe. When we travel, we travel within that world. You have your equivalent of the scene that you have here in L.A. When you go to London, you have your connectors that bring you into the same world.
 
Q: Isn't that just portable consumer choices?
 
SERGE: It's a support network. I'm sure there are people that arrive at great wisdom by not interacting at all.
 
Q: What one thing would you change if you could change anything?
 
DEREK: I'd slow the world down -- just the pace that everything's progressing at. That's the one thing that's anxiety ridden in me. If I slowed it down, somehow, inside me, it would calm a lot of stuff.
 
LISA: I want to be in love.
 
SERGE: Yeah?
 
DEREK: Yeah.

HEADLINE: A Web Tool For Giving

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
AFTER years of rising values of stocks, real estate and other assets, Americans overall are richer than ever, but this wealth has not spawned a new generosity. Giving to charities continues at its historic level of about 2 percent of income, tax data show. But a new Web tool, being announced today, will let people with assets see how much more they could give without economic pain.
Newtithing, a San Francisco organization created a decade ago to encourage people with assets to give more, developed the tool, called NewTitheCalc. It has a five-step process to show people how by analyzing income, expenses and assets they can compare their current giving practices with the NewTithing strategy. 
 Financial advisers and tax planners discourage giving by focusing on minimizing how much income is realized so that taxes are held down, said Claude Rosenberg, a retired San Francisco investment manager who founded NewTithing in 1990. He said people with financial assets, even modest ones, have much more capacity to give than they realize.
The calculator will be unveiled today at Sharing the Wealth, a philanthropy conference in Minneapolis. It will be available initially at two sites. One, maintained by Minnesota Public Radio, is access.mpr.org/civic_j/giving/ and the other is www.kqed.org, the site of San Francisco's public television station.
NewTithing explains its theory at its Web site (www.newtithing.org) and includes links to each Web site that is licensed to offer the calculator, said Tim D. Stone, a NewTithing spokesman.
This year about 250,000 families will have an income of more than $1 million, Internal Revenue Service data indicate. In 1997, the latest year for which detailed data are available, individuals and couples in the million-dollar-plus income class had an average income of $2.9 million and gave away $130,600 on average, or 4.5 percent of their income, more than twice the giving level for Americans overall.
But by making gifts based on assets, instead of income, Mr. Rosenberg believes these taxpayers could donate $1.3 million annually each on average without cutting into their way of life.
Mr. Rosenberg said that if his system was widely adopted, giving by all Americans would about triple, to close to a half-trillion dollars this year from an expected $170 billion or so.
"People's assessment of how much they can afford to donate is often flawed," the organization says, because "we often fail to acknowledge the shrinking purchasing power of money and the growth rate of our own investment assets."

HEADLINE: Choosing A Salary Or Tuition

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
WHILE his fellow seniors at Tiffin Columbian High School spent last year preparing for college, John-Thomas Gaietto set his eyes on heading straight to the pros. Distracted in school, Mr. Gaietto focused his energy and extracurricular time honing his skills and nurturing his natural gift.
It may sound like the prototypical story of a talented athlete, but this is the story of a computer geek. 
 Mr. Gaietto, 18, who grew up in Tiffin, Ohio, is not an isolated case. While it is difficult to pin down exact numbers, other computer-adept high school students like him nationwide are deciding to forgo college in favor of entering the red-hot technology field.
Computer jobs are plentiful, pay is solid, and, those choosing to pass on school say, the industry is moving so quickly that four years spent in college will be time spent falling behind.
"Why go learn something I already know?" said Mr. Gaietto, who works for Stone Computer in Royal Oak, Mo., setting up networks for corporations. "Everyone I know who is getting a four-year degree is behind the times."
The students say skills that had caused them to be labeled as geeks, even outcasts, in high school now bring validation and healthy salaries -- sometimes even stock packages -- that enable students not long from the prom to earn more than their parents.
"Everyone is giving you the positives of going to college," said Matthew G. Newell, the 20-year-old chief information officer at a startup in Detroit. "But when you look around, what you see are the positives of making $80,000 a year."
In reality, Mr. Newell is making $35,000 a year, but he hopes to hit it big financially if Service Advantage International, the company he helped found that helps corporations track customer service, takes off. Mr. Newell is currently enrolled at Eastern Michigan University, but to accommodate the 50 hours a week he works, he has cut back his class schedule to just seven credits this semester. His theory: college will always be there.
"The university has been around for 150 years," he said "It'll be around for another five if I want to finish my degree."
It is not clear how many students are passing up college to enter the computer field. Generally speaking, the percentage of high school graduates attending college dropped to 63 percent in 1999 from 67 percent in 1997, according to census figures. Steve Hipple, an economist for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said one of the reasons may be the hot economy and its technology engine.
The computer fields are growing at a torrid pace, according to government figures. In the last decade, there has been a 17 percent annual employment growth among computer systems analysts, a broad category that includes network administrators, Web designers, computer security professionals and computer scientists. That figure compares with an overall employment growth of 1.5 percent annually in the same period.
Salaries in computer-related fields reflect the demand for workers that has accompanied this growth. According to the Census Department's Current Population Survey, the median income in 1999 for computer systems analysts was $1,008 a week and the median income for computer programmers was $898 a week. That compares with an overall median wage of $550 a week, or $29,000 annually.
Still, not everyone is convinced that the lure of attractive salaries in the high-tech world should be the basis for deciding whether to pass on college. Students who make this decision often face skepticism from teachers and parents.
Diana Coleman, Mr. Gaietto's mother, said she had "mixed emotions" about her son's decision to bypass college. Ms. Coleman, who is 42, started college in 1977 but interrupted her education when she had a family. She went back to college, receiving her degree in 1995, in part to show her son the value of getting an education.
"He has a phenomenal opportunity," Ms. Coleman said of her son's current job, "but I really would have liked to have seen him go to college." Mr. Gaietto's father, Michael J. Gaietto, who never attended college, is more insistent. "If you go up against someone in a job interview who has less experience but a degree, chances are, they'll get the job," he said. "College degrees carry a lot of weight, and when you're young you don't realize it."
Some studies support the contention that it pays in the long run to earn a college degree. A study by the Census Bureau in 1994, the last time the agency looked at the subject, estimated that in 1992, the mean annual earnings for a person with a bachelor's degree was $32,629, compared with $18,737 for a high school graduate and $19,666 for a person with some college but no bachelor's degree.
John-Thomas Gaietto said that he had not given up on the idea of attending college and that he was a few credits short of earning a two-year technical degree. He said that he was earning "between $30,000 and $40,000" a year and that he and a friend had made an offer to buy a three-bedroom house that had an asking price of $136,000.
Mr. Gaietto said he was being rewarded for skills that in high school had made him "stick out like a sore thumb."
"I was always doing something that wasn't involved in class," he said. "I was always doing something with computers."
That sentiment is typical among young people with computer expertise who pass up college. Some say that they were terrible students in high school, bored by the subjects they were being taught, or not particularly well accepted socially, and that they found solace in the technology field, which seems to them to be more of a meritocracy and in which people are less judgmental about how an employee dresses, the music he listens to or even about whether he has an "attitude."
Corey Garnett, 20, who grew up in Lee's Summit, Mo., near Kansas City, and graduated in 1998 with less than a 2.0 grade point average from Lee's Summit High School, said he spent his high school days hanging out on the Internet and learning about network security.
He worked at an amusement park after school, then spent a semester at Blue River Community College before he concluded that school was not for him and moved to California to look for work in Silicon Valley.
Mr. Garnett works as a junior network administrator at Juniper Networks in Sunnyvale, Calif., helping to set up a research and development lab for engineers building new Internet routers, part of the hardware used to move data on the Internet. He makes about $50,000, he said, and has stock options that were modest to start with but have grown through stock splits to around $350,000.
He is torn about having decided not to attend college. "I think I missed out on not going to college from the maturity level and the social level, the lifelong friends," he said. But he added, "In this field, if you go to college, you're outdated."
Such issues may soon confront Roman Yaker, a 17-year-old high school junior from Birmingham, Ala. At the beginning of the summer, Mr. Yaker took a job at Global Network Privacy, a computer security firm in San Francisco. His job involved setting up secure e-commerce sites at a salary of what would be $40,000 a year if he worked year round.
Mr. Yaker said he was a strong student and well rounded socially, and he said he was still considering attending college. He said he would like to attend the University of California at Berkeley.
But the decision might not be easy. He recently bought his first car, a 1995 Honda Civic, and said he expected significant raises and more lucrative offers if he stayed in the working world.
"I like to work," he said, "and if I go to college, I might be missing out. People say the experience of college is great." Besides, he added, "my parents would do practically anything to get me to attend college."

HEADLINE: Helping the Cold-Nose Crowd

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE 

 BODY:
ROCCO arrived for physical therapy at Bonnie's K9 Swim Center in Manhattan, prancing with excitement, a bandana knotted around his thick furry neck and metal wheels strapped to his withered hind legs. Rocco, a 10-year-old German shepherd, had lymphoma last summer, followed by a ruptured disk requiring emergency surgery.
In a gesture of paternal tenderness combined with the umph of a furniture mover on the last landing, Lenny Addamo, Rocco's owner, lowered the 90-pound dog into the waiting arms of Jodi Richard, who was already submerged to her shoulders in 87-degree water and ready to right Rocco adroitly as he started to roll and submerge. The pool's surface, lightly dusted with dog hair, boiled around Rocco's flailing front paws as Ms. Richard, the owner of Bonnie's K9, a new therapy center for dogs, held on to his hips. 
 Ten years ago, physical therapy was mainly for people. Pets, even when valued as guardians and companions, received limited medical care and were often euthanized when they were deemed too old, too infirm or too expensive to treat. Today, as pets become more prized, and a booming economy creates more discretionary income, pet care might include a $400 customized weight-loss program at a health spa.
While the yellow pages bulge with listings for fancy poodle parlors, the latest pet spas are beginning to offer the same therapies available to humans -- from electro-stimulation to underwater treadmills. With fees kept low to attract all comers (an average $15 an hour for massage or swim therapy), these new therapy centers are only beginning to meet the demand of pet owners eager not only to indulge but also to save their animals. Typical of the new breed of pet spa is Bonnie's K9 in Chelsea, which offers massage and acupuncture as well as homemade organic dog food. Ms. Richard invested about $500,000 (with contributions from her husband, Dwight Merriman, co-founder of DoubleClick, an Internet advertising firm) to open the 2,000-square-foot center, designed by 1100 Architects of New York to be airy and odor-free. It is named after the couple's German shepherd, Bonnie, who had been caged for the first years of her life for breeding and, as a result, is paralyzed in her hind legs.
Ms. Richard, who is earning a veterinarian technician degree (the equivalent of a nursing degree), has two full-time employees and works most nights until 8. She charges $35 for 30 minutes of swim therapy ($25 if the pet owner conducts it); $50 for a swim and doggie massage. A juice bar for humans is in the works.
One recent evening, clad in a wet suit to keep from getting scratched, she handed a panting client a natural dog biscuit (and ate one too). "Some people think I'm crazy to be doing this," she said, "but it's extremely rewarding."
Veterinarians refer their clients to Ms. Richard, who treats dogs suffering from hip dysplasia, degenerative spinal disorders, cancer and other diseases resulting from dogs living longer than in the past.
"We were overwhelmed when we found out that Rocco was probably never going to walk again," said Dr. Dina Addamo, a resident doctor at Mount Sinai who had to work extra night shifts to help pay over $10,000 for her dog's cancer treatments. Rocco is currently in remission.
"We'd do practically anything; he deserves it," she added in a typical display of the unwavering strength of the animal-human bond.
Operating on a much larger scale, on farmland 50 miles east of Pittsburgh, is the Baden-Baden of New Age pet spas, the sprawling Cozy Inn Pet Resort and Spa. Here, one afternoon last week, workers led a 1-year-old black Labrador runt named Zoey in for a therapeutic swim session. Unable to stand for very long because of a congenital affliction caused by overbreeding, Zoey is shaky as a newborn foal. But once in the pool, she takes off like the swimmer she's supposed to be. Afterward an attendant wraps Zoey in a clean towel and returns her to a cage with a private door flap leading into the yard.
"At one time you took a dog with problems out and shot it," said Carol Boerio-Croft, the founder of Cozy Inn. "Now dogs have a much better lifestyle. They're not disposable anymore; they're part of the household."
Ms. Boerio-Croft, whose husband, Dr. Henry L. Croft Jr., is a veterinarian, was among the first to sense a growth industry in the making. Fourteen years ago she created a boarding center for pets and offered luxury amenities like facial massages and off-leash nature walks. Three years ago, she added the Mozart wing, a step-down center for postsurgical and geriatric dogs named after her terrier mutt, which died of cancer. The $2 million complex is steeped in pet-theme memorabilia, from plaster dog statues on the lawn to "101 Dalmatians" clocks. There are two indoor pools: one is shaped like a bone; the other is a whirlpool in the shape of a dog paw.
Business is brisk, with about 250 dogs on the grounds every day. Rates average $16 a day, generating enough income to allow the Crofts and an investor to underwrite a $3 million center in Pittsburgh, which is to open this winter. They say they hope it will serve as a prototype for a pet-care chain offering everything from vacation centers to education and spa treatments.
In Annandale, Va., Stan Marks, a real estate broker, was inspired to build a rehabilitation clinic for small animals after he was unable to find the care he wanted for his 14-year old German shepherd, who died four months ago from degenerative bone disease. The Royal Treatment center, which is opening in six months, will offer conditioning and weight-loss programs, hydrotherapy and range-of-motion exercises.
"People today are willing to go any distance for their pets," said Mr. Marks, who spent over $5,000 on hip replacements for his dog and even tried taking her to a horse farm in Virginia for swim therapy, but the water was 11 feet deep and too cold. "I'm the perfect example. And there are a lot of 'me's' out there."
Although physical therapy has been used on thoroughbred racehorses and greyhounds for at least 20 years, it is new to the world of pets. Determined to improve and prolong the lives of their animals, the aging Me Generation has become the Me and My Four-Legged Companion Generation.
"People are demanding these services," said Mr. Marks, who is already planning to open a second center next year in suburban Washington. "It's a whole new area of veterinary medicine, and it can't move fast enough to meet the demand."
A survey last year of 1,200 pet owners by the American Animal Hospital Association found that pet owners were more likely to take their animals to the veterinarian regularly than they were to see a doctor themselves. (Eighty-four percent of the respondents called themselves Mom or Dad when talking to their pets.)
The new therapy centers tend to focusmore on dogs than on cats, perhaps because cats live longer (16 years on average). Large dogs are considered old when they are 8. Modern medicine, often coupled with alternative methods and an insistent clientele, has stretched that natural limit.
Shelly and Jack Galati of Riverdale, N.Y., have a 15 1/2-year-old Labrador named Sydney that has been undergoing acupuncture for three years. When Sydney began falling on slippery floors, they started looking for additional treatments. "We know she's old, and we don't expect her to get better," Mr. Galati said. "We just want to keep her as she is."
Veterinarians are traditionally accustomed more to emergency medical care ("Help! My dog ate the remote control!") than to prevention and wellness care. The American Veterinary Medical Association has been cautious in embracing treatments like acupuncture and physical therapy, although it agrees that there is anecdotal evidence supporting their benefits. The veterinarians who recommend physical therapies say that animals tend to respond to treatment better than humans because they don't resist their exercise regimes and they have a higher threshold of pain, making it possible to rebuild muscular tissue more efficiently.
At present, there are no degree programs or licensing requirements for physical therapists for pets. "It's a bit of a problem, " said Dr. Robert B. Parker, head of surgery department at the Animal Medical Center, a highly regarded animal hospital in Manhattan. "It involves a lot of issues on the front lines of what should be done by a licensed veterinarian and what a lay person should do." (He often makes referrals to Bonnie's K9 for post-op dogs.)
The insurance industry, which has been curbing reimbursements for physical therapy for humans, has inadvertently supplied a talent pool for budding animal therapists. Two years ago, the American Physical Therapist Association started helping members explore the pet field "in part because insurance is not reimbursing people for continued physical therapy," said Cheryl Riegger-Krugh, who runs the organization's special interest group on animal physical therapy. She added that while people without insurance coverage tend to drop out of treatment, people with pets don't seem to mind paying for it out of their own pockets.
Ms. Boerio-Croft, the owner of Cozy Inn, has probably gone the limit herself. She spent $85,000 to fly her Irish wolfhound to Colorado for a bone marrow transplant with limited results. "I bought him 8 months," she said, "And I was happy to get it."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
It's good times, not bad, that nurture the enemies of the free market.

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel; This column appears here every Thursday. Virginia Postrel is the editor at large of Reason magazine and the author of "The Future and Its Enemies: The Growing Conflict Over Creativity, Enterprise, and Progress." Four economic analysts -- Ms. Postrel, Jeff Madrick, Alan B. Krueger and Hal R. Varian -- rotate as contributors.

 BODY:
IN a recent speech to economists gathered in Jackson Hole, Wyo., the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, warned that neither continued economic liberalization nor high economic growth was inevitable. Recent productivity gains have been above the norm, he said, driven by the "accelerating application of new insights" in technology. As those innovations reach their limits, he suggested, growth will drop to a lower, historically more normal level.
That slowing, Mr. Greenspan said, could unleash ideological forces for new regulations and protectionism that would, in turn, further depress the economy. Economic liberalization has been popular in recent decades, but opponents of trade, competition and economic dynamism have not gone away. 
 "Even among liberal democracies, one can still find deep-seated antipathy toward free-market competition and its partner, creative destruction, to use Joseph Schumpeter's now famous insight," Mr. Greenspan said, adding that "should recent positive trends in economic growth falter, it is quite imaginable that support for market-oriented resource allocation will wane and the latent forces of protectionism and state intervention will begin to reassert themselves in many countries, including the United States."
(For the full speech, see http://www .federalreserve.gov/BoardDocs /Speeches/2000/20000825.htm).
Bad times, in other words, may lead to more economic regulation, as people turn to government as a source of security. That was, of course, the New Deal prescription. But nowadays, people are much less likely to see regulation as the path to economic success.
As Mr. Greenspan himself acknowledged, the intellectual consensus about how the economy works has shifted dramatically. Policy makers and the general public now tend to accept freer markets, rather than government intervention, as the way to increase prosperity. Privatization, deregulation, lower taxes, open international markets and reduced government spending are thus more likely to be seen as remedies to economic crises than as the causes of them.
So an economic downturn might not actually have the dire policy results Mr. Greenspan warned of. That's the good news.
The bad news is that the converse is also true: good times don't promote liberalization. To the contrary, in the United States, new regulations tend to come after prolonged periods of prosperity. When times are good, economic restrictions look relatively cheap.
A wave of environmental and consumer legislation followed the sustained growth of the 1960's. And George Bush was aptly dubbed "the regulatory president" by Jonathan Rauch, the author of "Government's End: Why Washington Stopped Working" (Public Affairs, 1999), because of the new spate of environmental and employment regulations that topped off the growth of the 1980's. Deregulation, by contrast, began after the troubled economy of the 1970's.
Mr. Greenspan is, therefore, a bit of an optimist. He assumes that as long as the economy is good, freer markets will continue to enjoy support, and economies will remain open to entrepreneurial creative destruction.
Schumpeter himself thought otherwise. Writing in the 1930's, he noted that a successful capitalist economy will nurture freedom of speech, debate and criticism, which are themselves required for entrepreneurship to flourish. But that freedom will, in turn, encourage intellectuals who will aim their criticism at creative destruction itself.
Schumpeter, and the neoconservatives who adopted his views in the 1970's, underestimated the creative, intellectual and romantic impulses behind much entrepreneurship, and they discounted the power and appeal of intellectual criticism aimed at dysfunctional government regulations. But Schumpeter was right to suggest that a market economy will create its own critics.
Prosperity isn't enough to protect economic openness. And it's easy to begin to take good times for granted.
By identifying an economic downturn as the likely trigger of a new round of regulation, Mr. Greenspan may be underestimating the effects of boredom, complacency and larger amounts of leisure and disposable income. During good times, it's a lot easier to sell contempt for "materialism" and "consumerism" and for the open economic policies that make them possible.
The New Left, after all, defined itself in the Port Huron Statement not as the voice of the poor but as a movement of the disillusioned and discontented middle class, "people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort." More recently, the young activists campaigning against global trade are not complaining about economic sluggishness. To the contrary, they see growth as the problem.
"Economic growth, frankly, is leading to a decline in almost every ecosystem on earth," Juliette Beck, an organizer of protests in Seattle and Washington told the television interviewer Charlie Rose. "We cannot sustain this level of growth," she added, complaining that international agencies are "promoting more and more economic growth as a solution; we need to rethink the whole economic system that we're living in."
In an interview with The New Yorker, Ms. Beck, 27, described her prosperous upbringing in suburban San Diego, where "the consumerism was overwhelming." Her activism is not a product of economic desperation but of affluence.
These days, what Mr. Greenspan calls the "deep-seated antipathy toward free-market competition and its partner, creative destruction" comes less from a fear of poverty or lost jobs than it does from a visceral, aesthetic revulsion to technological dynamism and economic growth. The contemporary case for stasis and regulation doesn't depend, therefore, on an economic crisis, or on convincing people that free markets won't deliver the goods.
It's an argument that the goods -- and the creative processes that produce them -- aren't worth having.
That's an argument we're going to hear more often because it's the strongest appeal the enemies of open markets still have. It's a dangerous position, especially for the billions of people who have yet to experience the problems of overwhelming consumerism. But comfortable, affluent Americans also have a stake in defending economic dynamism, which not only preserves and extends prosperity but also fosters creativity, enterprise, and learning. Even the most competent central banker can't protect us from adopting bad ideas.

HEADLINE: Productivity In 2nd Quarter Grew Faster Than Estimate

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
American workers were even more productive than first thought in the second quarter, government figures showed today, reinforcing last month's decision by Federal Reserve policy makers to leave interest rates unchanged.
Productivity, a measure of how much a worker produces for each hour on the job, grew at a 5.7 percent annual rate from April through June, the Labor Department said. That is up from the 5.3 percent pace originally estimated and triple the 1.9 percent rate of increase for the first quarter. 
 Over the last four years, productivity surged as company investments in computers and other technology have taken hold. Worker output per hour grew by an average 2.5 percent a year during that period after averaging about 1.6 percent annual growth during the previous 25 years.
"The high productivity numbers have ameliorated concerns for inflation for the time being," Thomas Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said late last month. If productivity gains continue at a 3 percent pace, the economy can grow by about 4 percent a year without igniting inflation, he said.
The economy expanded at an average annual rate of 6 percent over the last four quarters, and growth exceeded 4 percent in each of the last three years. Economists once regarded growth in excess of 2 percent to 3 percent a year as an inflation threat, yet consumer prices are not rising at an accelerating rate -- when higher oil costs are excluded.
The revision to the second-quarter productivity estimate reflected higher output and fewer hours worked than previously reported.
Productivity was 5.2 percent higher compared with the second quarter of last year, the largest year-over-year increase since a 5.3 percent gain in the third quarter of 1983.
Unit labor costs -- a gauge of wages per measure of output -- fell at a 0.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, originally reported as a 0.1 percent rate of decline. The decrease was the third in the last year.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Southeast Asia Losing Ground In New Economy, Report Says

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Sept. 6

 BODY:
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations has released a report warning that despite a level of economic recovery, globalization threatens the region's competitiveness as an exporter and a place to invest.
"All over the world, continent-sized economies, regional free trade areas and other forms of economic partnership mount a serious challenge to Asean in the global competition for markets and investments," said the report, written by the regional group's general secretary, Rodolfo C. Severino of the Philippines. 
 The report is usually released after an annual meeting in July of Asean foreign ministers, but a spokesman for the association said it was withheld this year by mistake.
The released report omits references to doubts about governments' commitment to economic reform, which were included in earlier versions leaked to local reporters.
Nonetheless, the report is certain to provide grist in the debate about the effects of globalization. As world leaders meet at the United Nations this week to discuss globalization, economists and financial authorities in Southeast Asia are contemplating how the increasingly borderless world of commerce and information is somehow marginalizing once-envied tiger economies.
Despite an uneven recovery from the financial crisis that began in 1997, most Southeast Asian economies, while still growing, have slipped behind in opening markets and competing globally.
Political instability, sluggish efforts to mobilize private capital and inadequate progress in high technology are combining with increased competition from outside the region to reduce Southeast Asia's ability to meet the aspirations of a generation of young job seekers raised on Hollywood and MTV.
As the demands for change from this up-and-coming generation collide with vested interests, "there is potential for serious political turmoil," said William C. Belchere, head of fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch here in Singapore.
On the surface, Southeast Asia's vital signs look good. Economic growth is slowing but is on track toward a 7 percent gain this year, according to J. P. Morgan. Exports remain strong, with the region a major source of computer and telecommunications hardware.
But the report from Asean -- which groups together Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- points up several worrisome trends.
First is a dwindling share of exports to the United States, the world's largest economy. Though Southeast Asian exports have steadily risen, United States imports from China and from Mexico are rising more quickly. In the meantime, foreign investment in Asean nations has been shifting to other developing countries, according to the report.
"If Southeast Asia doesn't work harder, you could see some deindustrialization," said Tan Kong Nam, who heads the department of business policy at the National University of Singapore.
Economists like Professor Tan warn that Southeast Asia is caught in a difficult transition between an older model of Japanese-style, state-guided economic growth and a new and unproven model based on free movements of capital and labor. Under the old model, foreign and especially Japanese investment played a crucial role -- along with huge public bank deposits -- in helping governments build export industries.
That investment reached a peak in 1996, resulting in industrial overcapacity, a collapse in asset prices and a debt burden that still hobbles the region's banks and curtails its ability to finance the transition to the new economy, Professor Tan said.
Indeed, the Asean report finds a "stark" digital divide between Southeast Asia and some other economies, offering statistics showing, among other things, that the Chinese are more than twice as likely to use the Internet as Southeast Asians.
The size of this region's market for electronic commerce indicates a similar kind of disparity. Though growing rapidly, Southeast Asia has made only one-tenth the transition toward the new economy that the United States has, according to figures from the International Data Corporation.
Asia lacks much of the physical infrastructure required for electronic commerce to take off. Attitudes also play a big part, technology executives say, since transactions conducted over networks have a kind of transparency that is anathema to the cozy relationships and under-the-table deals that have long characterized business in the region.
Analysts and investors say Southeast Asia's diversity also hinders the development of a new economy. The region, with a market of nearly 800 million people, is divided by nationality, culture, language and regulations, with no one market of Internet users, that can compare with the likes of China or even Latin America. "It makes it tougher for these companies to develop," said Dane Anderson, vice president for Internet research at International Data in Singapore.

From this unexpected corner of the North Atlantic, American consumers could soon see a ray of relief from shortages that have kept oil and natural gas prices stubbornly high. But even though the new energy supplies will be welcome, they are not expected to bring prices down soon.
Next spring, Terra Nova, a $200 million, 14-story oil production vessel will move 220 miles east of here, lock into place over a 400-million-barrel pool of oil, and start pumping 100,000 barrels a day, largely for the Northeastern United States. In addition, Nova Scotia has started sending natural gas south, and that flow could increase greatly in coming years. 
 Atlantic Canada, from Nova Scotia to Labrador, could prove to be the next-generation North Sea or Prudhoe Bay. And Newfoundland, long Canada's poorest province, stands to reap the biggest benefit. Of the 11 oil fields larger than 100 million barrels discovered worldwide since 1979, 4 have been off the coast of Newfoundland, on the Grand Banks.
Today, the cacophony from 1,300 workers hammering and welding the Terra Nova production vessel near here are drawing attention to two new trends: Americans' growing reliance on Canada for energy, and the future of Atlantic Canada as a major supplier of oil and natural gas to the Northeastern United States.
While most oil fields outside the Persian Gulf are mature and declining in production, Atlantic Canada's oil industry is taking its baby steps. Of the four major fields offshore here, Hibernia started producing in 1997 and Terra Nova is to start producing early next summer.
"We have barely touched the Grand Banks," said Gary Bruce, vice president for offshore development with Petro-Canada, Canada's second-largest integrated oil company and the lead operator at Terra Nova.
Newfoundland is in the midst of a 15-year, $10 billion oil investment plan. By 2004, this long-overlooked province is to be pumping 400,000 barrels a day, the same amount as a small OPEC producer like Ecuador. That quantity, to be sure, would meet only a small portion of the average daily United States consumption of nearly 20 million barrels. But unlike Ecuador, Newfoundland is politically stable and no more than three days by tanker from New York.
Already, Canada is the top supplier to the United States of natural gas and the No. 2 supplier of oil, after Saudi Arabia. During the first half of this year, a 44 percent jump in the value of Canada's oil and gas exports to the United States helped push Canada's June trade surplus with its neighbor to a monthly record of $5.2 billion. Responding to higher prices, Canada's oil production in June was up 7.5 percent from a year earlier, to 2.25 million barrels a day, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.
While Western states have long imported oil and gas from Alberta, Eastern states only started importing natural gas from Nova Scotia's massive gas field in January and oil from Newfoundland's Hibernia field three years ago. By 2005, 40 percent of Canada's conventional oil production is to come from Newfoundland. After half a century of production, wells in Alberta produce an average of 50 barrels a day. Off Newfoundland, the average is 20,000 a day.
In a mirror-like reversal of Canada's traditional oil picture, Exxon Mobil now estimates the potential conventional offshore oil reserves of Eastern Canada to be 40 billion barrels, compared with 34 billion for Western Canada. Lured by estimates like these, the major oil players are pumping billions of dollars through this four-century-old harbor city.
"Eastern Canada is becoming better and better known in the industry," said Kenneth J. Miller, a Scot, who shuttles between here and Calgary, Alberta, to run Mobil Oil Canada's eastern operations. Canada's largest oil producer, Exxon Mobil has a leading, 33 percent, share in Hibernia; a 22 percent interest in Terra Nova, and 60 percent of Nova Scotia's new gas development, the Sable Offshore Energy Project.
In addition to Exxon Mobil and Petro-Canada leading developments here, there is Husky Oil, which leads in White Rose, a field that is to start production toward the end of 2003. Chevron Canada Resources leads in Hebron-Ben Nevis, tentatively scheduled for production around 2006. In late July, Canadian officials increased their estimates of Hibernia, White Rose and Hebron-Ben Nevis by a third, to 2.1 billion barrels.
"When you see an iceberg, you only see 10 percent," said Brian Tobin, premier of Newfoundland and Labrador. "Well, our oil and gas industry is an iceberg waiting to reveal itself."
While some oil goes to Eastern Canada, the big market is the Eastern seaboard of the United States.
"All the oil is going down the North Atlantic, to New York, to Philadelphia," said David N. Willis, president of the consortium that operates Hibernia, which is producing 165,000 barrels a day.
Mark Turner, a ship captain and maritime lawyer here, said, "New York is the energy eater."
In addition to oil, Atlantic Canada offers natural gas, increasingly the energy of choice for new American homes and power plants. While much of New York City's gas comes from Alberta, the reserves of Newfoundland and Labrador are 62 trillion cubic feet, estimated Mr. Turner, who recently completed his term as chairman of the Newfoundland Ocean Industries Association, the energy company group here. That would provide energy for more than 700 million homes for a year.
In Nova Scotia, a new 653-mile pipeline is pumping natural gas from the 3.5-trillion-cubic-foot Sable reserve through New Brunswick, Maine and southern New Hampshire to link up with existing pipelines north of Boston. Near the Sable development, three other companies are drilling 15 test wells this year. Nova Scotia has granted 43 exploration licenses and has set an Oct. 30 deadline for bids on 2,875 square miles of ocean around Sable. As a measure of the gas industry's infancy, there are about 200 wells, largely for exploration, off Nova Scotia, compared with more than 6,000 in the Gulf of Mexico.
"The U.S. is consuming gas like crazy," Mr. Bruce of Petro-Canada said. "If current prices remain on a sustainable basis, it will be economical to run a gas pipeline to the U.S."
With natural gas prices running at almost double last year's levels, oil producers in Newfoundland are studying rival proposals to tap their mammoth gas reserves with a pipeline or with ships loaded with compressed or liquefied natural gas.
Paul D. Dicks, Newfoundland's energy minister, estimated that within 10 years a gas pipeline would be built from the Grand Banks to Newfoundland to Boston, a $3 billion project.
The investments in Atlantic Canada are part of a response to the stimulus of rising prices. In Western Canada, the number of wells drilled this year is expected to jump 50 percent, to 15,529. Over all, a government survey showed that oil companies planned to invest $13 billion in plants and equipment this year. Fueling investments are record second-quarter profits. Petro-Canada's profit jumped fourfold, to $174 million. Alberta Energy increased profit sixfold, to $78.5 million.
The people of this island jutting into the North Atlantic, nicknamed the Rock, see the energy boom as welcome news. Newfoundland has Canada's highest unemployment rate, about 17 percent. In recent years, it has been the only province to lose population, shrinking by about 1 percent a year.
Accustomed to bad news, and to making ends meet with federal revenue-sharing payments averaging about $3,400 a resident, Newfoundlanders are suddenly reading headlines in Toronto newspapers like "Newfoundland, Alberta expected to lead growth."
In a startling turnaround, this province of 540,000 people had the highest growth rates of Canada's 10 provinces in 1998 and 1999. This year, it is expected to top the list again, matching the last two years' growth rates by expanding 5 percent.
Offshore oil production is an extremely capital-intensive business, with the cost of a single well often being 100 times that of a land-based well. To lift employment, Newfoundlanders have set an ambitious goal of joining Scotland, Norway and South Korea as major fabricators of offshore drilling structures.
Although initial royalties from Hibernia have been considered low by the provincial government, Mr. Tobin, the premier, said he believed that oil and gas would be Newfoundland's ticket to self-sufficiency.
"When I look to oil and gas," said Mr. Tobin, a former federal fisheries minister, "I see Newfoundland and Labrador in a decade shaking off a history of being the poor cousin, the have-not province of Canada."

HEADLINE: F.B.I. Lists Caution Signs For Violence In Classroom

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
The F.B.I. responded to a spate of deadly school shootings today by giving educators a report with a list of warning signs that includes obsession with violence and access to guns at home.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation emphasized that the report did not contain a profile of school gunmen or a checklist of danger signs that could identify a student likely to commit an act of lethal violence. 
 "At this time, there is no research that has identified traits and characteristics that can reliably distinguish school shooters from other students," the report said.
Nonetheless, the report provided a list of more than 40 signs for school officials to check once a threat of violence had been discovered. The list covers the student's personality and family, as well as school and social dynamics.
Some examples of warning signs in the report included recurrent themes of destruction or violence in a student's writing or artwork, resentment over real or perceived injustices, a fascination with violent entertainment and weapons in the home. In one case cited by the F.B.I., a student in a home economics class baked a cake in the shape of a gun and used recurrent themes of violence in his writing.
The report resulted from a two-year study that examined 18 school shooting cases. Although the incidents were not identified, the report said the April 1999 shootings that left 15 people dead at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., added urgency to the research efforts.
Attorney General Janet Reno said in the report that the F.B.I.'s threat assessment model must be used judiciously to avoid "the risk of unfairly labeling and stigmatizing children."
Among things to look for in assessing threats are hopelessness, despair, hatred, isolation, loneliness, nihilism or an "end-of-the-world" philosophy and a preoccupation with themes of violence, the report said.
The report also mentioned students who are easily angered, who have had a failed relationship, who have an attitude of superiority and who are rigid and opinionated.
At a news conference at F.B.I. headquarters, Deputy Director Thomas Pickard said the report would help school officials "identify and deal with high-risk threats that are a major concern."
Mary Ellen O'Toole, an F.B.I. agent who wrote the report, said school violence was difficult to predict, but, she added, "There are observable signs along the way."

U.S. and Europeans Raising the Stakes in Trade Impasse

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Sept. 6

 BODY:
The European Union and the United States are holding fast in several trade disputes, their continued standoff threatening a more punishing confrontation between the two trading blocs, the world's biggest.
The European Union has rejected the United States' attempt to overhaul a tax benefit that saves American companies millions of dollars a year. The move comes at a time when Washington is drawing up a list of more than $300 million in tariffs on European goods, mainly food, after the Europeans refused to alter their restrictions on banana imports and on hormone-treated beef. 
 Earlier this year, a panel of the World Trade Organization, based here, ruled that the United States must change a law that allowed companies -- including General Motors, Microsoft and Boeing -- to avoid paying taxes on some overseas sales by channeling them through offshore subsidiaries. Under the trade forum's rules, Washington has until Oct. 1 to revise the law, which the panel called an illegal export subsidy.
In a letter made public late last week, the European Union trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, asserted that American changes still retain export subsidies in violation of W.T.O. rules, and enable the subsidies to exist beyond the October deadline. "The only way for a U.S.-based manufacturer to benefit from the new regime is by exporting," said a European summary of the letter to Stuart E. Eizenstat, the deputy secretary of the Treasury.
An attempt in May to reach a compromise failed, and Mr. Eizenstat warned in July that "a major trade war" could follow.
The new system for offshore sales was approved by the House Ways and Means Committee late in July, and awaits approval by the House and Senate. Clinton administration officials indicate they intend to press for Congressional approval of the modified law.
Although the European letter was not made public, Mr. Lamy is understood to have argued that the only real change in the American tax breaks was eliminating a requirement that a paper company be set up offshore. Some 5,000 such offshore tax havens exist, most of them based in the Caribbean region.
European officials in Brussels say they are willing to continue negotiations. "There is one month before the Oct. 1 deadline, and we believe there is still time for a solution," said Herve Jouanjean of the European Commission, the year-round administrative arm.
Without a compromise, Brussels is expected to seek W.T.O. permission to impose retaliatory sanctions on American exports in amounts that dwarf previous trade disputes. Such sanctions are meant to be based on the amount of harm suffered in the international marketplace. Using that measure, the Europeans are likely to seek 100 percent tariffs on $4 billion in American exports.
If Congress passes the proposed legislation before Oct. 1, trade experts said, the European Union would most likely have to file a new challenge to the law. A ruling, which is delivered by a three-judge panel, could take months.
In the dispute over bananas and beef, the Clinton administration is preparing a list of European products that would be subject to tariffs. Britain is lobbying for the exemption of Scottish cashmere from the list.
The European Union's initial effort to modify its banana-import rules, which gave preferential treatment to former European colonies in Africa and the Caribbean, was rebuffed by the United States as insufficient. Brussels officials are now trying to work out agreement on a new alternative among the European nations and their banana-exporting partners.
The Europeans and the United States also remain at odds over how to replace Brussels' ban on hormone-treated beef, which was struck down at the W.T.O. Currently, the Europeans are banning one hormone and temporarily excluding four others while scientific studies evaluate their effect on human health. The United States maintains that the growth-inducing hormones are safe.

Clinton, At the U.N.: 'Aspirations Pile High'

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of the address given today by President Clinton at the United Nations, as provided by the White House:
Madam President, Mr. Secretary General, my fellow leaders, let me begin by saying it is a great honor to have this unprecedented gathering of world leaders in the United States. 
 We come together not just at a remarkable moment on the calendar, but at the dawn of a new era in human affairs, when globalization and the revolution in information technology have brought us closer together than ever before. To an extent unimaginable just a few years ago, we reach across geographical and cultural divides. We know what is going on in each other's countries. We share experiences, triumphs, tragedies, aspirations.
Our growing interdependence includes the opportunity to explore and reap the benefits of the far frontiers of science and the increasingly interconnected economy. And as the Secretary General just reminded us, it also includes shared responsibilities to free humanity from poverty, disease, environmental destruction and war. That responsibility, in turn, requires us to make sure the United Nations is up for the job.
Fifty-five years ago, the U.N. was formed to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. Today there are more people in this room with the power to achieve that goal than have ever been gathered in one place. We find today fewer wars between nations, but more wars within them. Such internal conflicts, often driven by ethnic and religious differences, took five million lives in the last decade, most of them completely innocent victims.
These conflicts present us with a stark challenge. Are they part of the scourge the U.N. was established to prevent? If so, we must respect sovereignty and territorial integrity, but still find a way to protect people, as well as borders.
The last century taught us that there are times when the international community must take a side, not merely stand between the sides or on the sidelines. We faced such a test and met it when Mr. Milosevic tried to close the last century with the final chapter of ethnic cleansing and slaughter. We have faced such a test for 10 years in Iraq, where the U.N. has approved a fair blueprint spelling out what must be done. It is consistent with our resolutions and our values, and it must be enforced.
We face another test today in Burma, where a brave and popular leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, once again has been confined -- with her supporters in prisons and her country in distress -- in defiance of repeated U.N. resolutions.
But most conflicts and disputes are not so clear-cut. Legitimate grievances and aspirations pile high on both sides. Here there is no alternative to principled compromise, in giving up old grudges in order to get on with life.
Right now, from the Middle East to Burundi to the Congo to South Asia, leaders are facing this kind of choice, between confrontation and compromise.
Chairman Arafat and Prime Minister Barak are with us here today. They have promised to resolve the final differences between them this year, finally completing the Oslo process embodied in the Declaration of Principles signed seven years ago this month at the White House.
To those who have supported the right of Israel to live in security and peace, to those who have championed the Palestinian cause these many years, let me say to all of you: They need your support now, more than ever, to take the hard risks for peace. They have the chance to do it.
But like all life's chances, it is fleeting and about to pass. There is not a moment to lose.
When leaders do seize this chance for peace, we must help them. Increasingly, the United Nations has been called into situations where brave people seek reconciliation, but where the enemies of peace seek to undermine it. In East Timor, had the United Nations not engaged, the people would have lost the chance to control their future.
Today I was deeply saddened to learn of the brutal murder of the three U.N. relief workers there by the militia in West Timor, and I urge the Indonesian authorities to put a stop to these abuses.
In Sierra Leone, had the United Nations not engaged, countless children now living would be dead. But in both cases, the U.N. did not have the tools to finish the job. We must provide those tools -- with peacekeepers that can be rapidly deployed with the right training and equipment, missions well defined and well led, with the necessary civilian police.
And we must work, as well, to prevent conflict; to get more children in school; to relieve more debt in developing countries; to do more to fight malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS, which cause a quarter of all the deaths in the world; to do more to provoke prevention and to stimulate the development and affordable access to drugs and vaccines; to do more to curb the trade in items which generate money that make conflict more profitable than peace, whether diamonds in Africa or drugs in Colombia.
All these things come with a price tag. And all nations, including the United States, must pay it.
These prices must be fairly apportioned, and the U.N. structure of finances must be fairly reformed so the organization can do its job. But those in my country or elsewhere who believe we can do without the U.N. or impose our will upon it misread history and misunderstand the future.
Let me say to all of you, this is the last opportunity I will have as president to address this General Assembly. It is the most august gathering we have ever had, because so many of you have come from so far away. If I have learned anything in these last eight years, it is, whether we like it or not, we are growing more interdependent. We must look for more solutions in which all sides can claim a measure of victory and move away from choices in which someone is required to accept complete defeat. That will require us to develop greater sensitivity to our diverse political, cultural and religious claims. But it will require us to develop even greater respect for our common humanity.
The leaders here assembled can rewrite human history in the new millennium. If we have learned the lessons of the past, we can leave a very different legacy for our children. But we must believe the simple things -- that everywhere in every land, people in every station matter. Everyone counts, everyone has a role to play, and we all do better when we help each other.
Thank you, and God bless you all.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Rise in Rates Is Not Stemming The Euro's Slide

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Higher interest rates don't seem to be helping.
The euro, born amid optimism some 20 months ago, suffered the worst day of its young life yesterday, as it lost 2.3 percent of its value against the dollar, settling at 87.01 cents. 
 The European currency also hit a record low against the Japanese yen as it briefly traded below 92 yen.
It was just over a week ago, on Aug. 31, that the European Central Bank raised interest rates for the sixth time in a year. The central bank then expressed concern over the "protracted depreciation" of the euro, which is down 26.5 percent against the dollar since Jan. 4, 1999, the first business day for the euro -- the currency of 11 European countries.
The euro has long since come to seem quite cheap by many measures, like purchasing power parity, but that has not helped the currency to rally. Nor have higher interest rates helped.
The theory is that higher interest rates help to bring in money to an economy, but while that may be true in some circumstances, it is not helping now.
Part of the story is that the United States has also been raising interest rates as well, but the other part of the story is that it is not debt investments that now drive investment flows. It is the equity investments, both through stock purchases and direct foreign investments, that have driven the dollar up and the euro down.
It is in that environment that the dollar has performed well despite a high and growing current account deficit.
That deficit, largely driven by the trade deficit, must be financed by foreigners willingly reinvesting the money in dollar-denominated assets. So far they have been more than willing to do so.
Given that current reality, the best course if Europe wants to support its common currency would seem to be to make itself more attractive for equity investors, and to some extent it has done so. European growth is at its highest levels in a decade, albeit still below growth in the United States. "I am very impressed by European corporate restructuring," said Nicholas P. Sargen, global market strategist for J. P. Morgan's private clients. He compared the restructuring to that embarked upon by many United States companies in the 1980's.
In addition, Germany is overhauling its tax structure in a way that is widely viewed as attractive to foreign investment and is likely to be imitated by other European countries.
But none of that has been enough to make European investments seem more attractive than American ones, and raising interest rates may hurt if it threatens to slow growth and thereby make equity investments less attractive.
"If you are tightening because your currency is weak, and your real economy and markets are also weak, it is not going to work," Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig Securities, said yesterday.
The euro has not been helped by the fact that while it is one currency, it has 11 governments. There have been efforts to get those 11 governments to show solidarity in defense of the currency, but in fact some Europeans like a weak currency. European exports are booming, in part because of the falling euro, and that eases pressures for structural reforms to European economies that are strongly resisted by European unions, among others.
"The current euro-dollar rate is more of a reason to be happy than concerned," said Gerhard Schroder, the German chancellor, in a speech on Monday that helped to provoke the latest decline.
Yesterday's German economic data showed some of the results of the weak euro. Unemployment fell to its lowest level in five years, although it still remains at 9.5 percent of the work force, in part because of strong factory orders from abroad. "The export orders were very strong," noted John McCarthy, director of foreign exchange at ING-Barings Capital Markets.
But Mr. McCarthy said there was nonetheless a wave of selling of the euro from Americans after it became clear that the currency was moving decisively below 89 cents, the area where it bottomed in May before rallying back above 96 cents in June. The currency had ended Tuesday's trading at 89.06 cents.
When the euro was introduced, there were widespread predictions it would be a strong currency, continuing the historic role of the German mark.
But the current level of the euro is equivalent to a value of 2.24 marks to the dollar -- the highest level for the dollar since 1986, when the dollar was falling from historically overvalued levels.
At the time, interest-rate-denominated investments were much more important in driving currency flows, and American interest rates had fallen sharply. In addition, the American economy was slowing.
In the end, the euro's weakness may end only when American investments come to seem less attractive, either because American markets are falling rapidly or because the American economy appears to be in danger of a recession. Neither possibility seems very likely to investors at the moment.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS -- THE ROAD TO SYDNEY;
Not a Game to the 'Stolen Generation'

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Valerie Murphy stood in the alley behind her modest house on the tattered fringe of downtown, smoking nervously, looking away as if to keep tears from coming into her eyes. Even now, four decades later, she said she could hardly speak of the time when her life had been stolen.
At 53, she is part of what is known here as the "stolen generation," one of perhaps 100,000 Aboriginal children, most of them light skinned, who were taken from their parents between 1910 and 1970 and placed into training homes to be assimilated into the dominant white culture. 
 "I don't like thinking about it," Murphy said, producing a photograph of herself, uncertainty and fear on her face, with other girls at the Cootamundra Training Home for Girls.
"I was 5 or 6 when they took me. Eleven years I was there. When you did something wrong, they put you in a room like a box. I would bang and bang to get out of that box. When I was 14, the police flogged me. They have taken my life away."
The Summer Olympics, which begin Sept. 15, will showcase Sydney's famous Opera House, its arresting harbor vistas and its fabulous swimmers. The Games will also focus attention on the plight of the Aborigines, Australia's indigenous minority who originally inhabited the continent 50,000 years ago but were marginalized over the past two centuries by European settlers.
The treatment of the Aboriginals, who make up about 400,000 of Australia's 19 million people, has a bleak resonance with the struggles of American Indians and blacks in the United States. Indigenous people were not allowed to vote until 1962 in Australia and were not counted in the national census until 1967. Life expectancy is 18 years shorter for Aboriginals, average incomes are one-third lower and the unemployment rate -- 34 percent -- is nearly five times the national average.
Problems with alcohol, drugs, suicide, domestic violence and high birth rates are severe. A quarter of the Aboriginals age 55 or over have never been to school. Aborigines account for half of the young people incarcerated in the juvenile justice system.
The Australian government will spend $1.5 billion on Aboriginal programs this year, addressing disadvantages in health, education, employment and housing. In May, more than 200,000 people marched through Sydney in support of racial equality. But contentious debate persists on how to achieve reconciliation.
Only last week, after a number of reprimands, the conservative government of Prime Minister John Howard announced that it would no longer cooperate with the United Nation's attempt to investigate Australia's human rights practices.
Apparently concerned about the government's vulnerability to demands for compensation, Howard has declined to formally apologize to the Aborigines. He has also opposed a civil rights treaty for Aborigines. Opinion polls indicate that most Australians support Howard in opposition to special treatment for indigenous people.
"Both the prime minister and I have expressed our personal feelings of deep sorrow in relation to the injustices suffered by indigenous Australians as a result of the practices of past generations," said Senator John Herron, the minister for Aboriginal affairs.
But the government does not support a formal apology, Herron said, because it "could imply that present generations are in some way responsible and accountable for the actions of earlier generations, actions that were sanctioned by the laws of the time, and that were believed to be in the best interests of the children concerned."
Aborigines have sharply criticized Herron for suggesting that perhaps only 10 percent of Aboriginal children were taken from their families and for calling the term "stolen generation" rhetorical.
"They say we were not stolen," Murphy said outside her home in the Redfern section of Sydney. "It made me cry, it hurt so much."
She said she was not seeking financial reparation from the government, only an apology for past wrongs.
"In my heart, it would be helpful," she said.
Australia's most celebrated Aborigine, Cathy Freeman, the world champion in the 400-meter sprint and an Olympic gold medal favorite, called the federal government insensitive in July and revealed that her grandmother had been taken from her parents and did not know her own birthday or her precise age.
"This is an endemic problem ignored by most Australians, and there seems to be compassion fatigue for acknowledging the problem," said Senator Aden Ridgeway, the only Aboriginal member of Parliament.
The cause of the Aborigines will be made visible during the Olympics in both celebration and protest. Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, plans to mention the Aborigines in his remarks during opening ceremonies. The boomerang, an Aboriginal hunting tool, has been incorporated into the official Olympic logo.
Organizers will allow the red, black and yellow Aboriginal flag -- depicting the earth, the skin of the indigenous people and the sun -- to be flown at Olympic stadiums. Freeman and others will also be welcomed to carry the flag during victory laps.
In Victoria Park, just outside Sydney's central business district, televisions will be hooked up so that protesters occupying 40 or so tents at the so-called Aboriginal Tent Embassy can watch Freeman run. A fire ritual is performed each day at the encampment as branches from gum trees are placed on smoking logs in a gesture of peace and healing. Oral histories will be presented at Aboriginal forums in the park during the Games, and a rally is planned for the day the Games open.
"We want the world to know that this country is at war with its indigenous people," said Isabell Coe, the advocate who started the tent embassy in July.
Another group is planning to form a human chain along the road outside the Sydney airport to make Olympic visitors aware of the despairing condition of Australia's indigenous people. Trevor Close, an Aboriginal activist, said he planned to camp with some protesters near the Olympic Stadium and might resort to violent clashes if the police interfere.
The Aborigines were nomadic hunter-gatherers still using stone tools when European settlers, primarily British convicts, arrived in 1788. Their encounter with white migration proved ruinous to the Aborigines' way of life. Many were massacred, others died of diseases to which they were not immune and survivors were placed in missions run by churches and the government.
"We are being treated like aliens in our own country," Coe said. "The only place we are winning is the number of prisoners."
Still, Aboriginals have managed to produce notable achievements in recent years on the national and world stage. Nova Perris-Kneebone became the first Aborigine to win a gold medal as part of Australia's field hockey team at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Freeman is a two-time world champion and Olympic silver medalist in the 400 meters. The Aborginal writer Kim Scott won a share of Australia's top fiction prize this year.
On the other hand, two members of the so-called stolen generation had their claims for reparation dismissed last month in a federal test case.
The urban despair of Sydney's Aborigines is apparent in Murphy's blighted neighborhood, known as "the block," a failed land-grant experiment for indigenous people. It is a rat- and drug-infested collection of graffiti-scarred houses where heroin addicts inject themselves 50 yards from a playground where children frolick on swings.
Ridgeway, the Aboriginal senator, said the sense of fatalism can be overcome only by self-determination, including the recognition of traditional laws, diversionary programs instead of mandatory prison sentencing and restoring the role of Aboriginal elders within communities. But the current government is concerned that the creation of two sets of laws would diminish the sense of Australia as a single nation.
"If you are talking about a disciplinary code that is breached and the penalty enacted might be a spear in the thigh, by today's values that would be something broadly unacceptable," said Philip Ruddock, the minister of immigration and multicultural affairs.
The infant mortality rate among Aboriginals, once 20 times the national average, has decreased to three times the national average. While only a handful of Aborigines once went to college, there are now 8,000 college graduates, ministry statistics show.
But a much more comprehensive effort needs to be taken, Ridgeway contended, or the cycle of poverty and despair will only perpetuate itself under the current welfare state.
"The most a young Aboriginal person can expect to achieve is to work for the dole scheme, and he essentially reaches that at 16, 17 or 18," Ridgeway said. "There is nothing beyond that. Incarceration becomes a badge of honor, a right of passage into adulthood."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN NEW YORK: THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY;
The State of the World, and the World to Be, in 149 Chapters

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 6

 BODY:
The question hangs out there: Why would 149 world leaders leave their not-always-stable governments unattended to come to New York and make five-minute speeches, mostly to each other and the television cameras from back home?
Secretary General Kofi Annan had an answer today as he lifted his glass to the biggest power lunch in history. 
 "You," he said, looking out over the world's political elite, "have the authority to speak for, and the ability to transform, the lives of six billion people."
This "millennium summit" was a gamble, organized not to celebrate a new page on the calendar but to look ahead at what kind of a global society the leaders hope to achieve in this century, if not the millennium to come.
But from the start, everyone knew that it would go beyond that, and would probably be remembered more for the private meetings in hotel suites and diplomatic offices around town than for anything said in the cavernous hall of the General Assembly.
There was a kind of easy camaraderie born of the unusual event, with back-slapping, hugs, kisses and the puzzled faces of interpreters trying to keep up with the in-jokes.
President Clinton, for one, could not resist telling President Jiang Zemin of China, as they sat down to lunch, what a softball interview the Chinese leader had with CBS's "60 Minutes." "Mike Wallace is so mean to us," Mr. Clinton complained to his lunch-table buddies, "and he was purring in front of him."
President Fidel Castro of Cuba, whose reputation for long-winded speeches is legendary, brought laughter to the Assembly late in the afternoon when he took out a white handkerchief and covered the timer on the lectern. But he stayed within the allotted time -- and waved triumphantly before retaking his seat.
For an hour early this morning, many of the world's most familiar faces passed by the knot of protocol officers waiting at the canopied delegates' entrance to United Nations headquarters. As speeches began -- they are expected to go on well into Friday evening -- the stock-taking that emerged was not so much of the world the leaders hoped to see, but of the stark realities out there.
"The statistics of poverty and inequality in our world are shocking and shameful," said Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland. "Half the world's population struggling on less than $2 a day, over half a billion on less than $1. A quarter of a billion children of 14 and under working, sometimes in terrible conditions. Death from preventable and treatable diseases -- 10 people will die of malaria in the five minutes I take to address you."
President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria -- who shared a lunch table with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Annan, Mr. Jiang, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, two kings and several others -- is currently chairman of the Group of 77, a forum for developing nations. In an interview on Monday, when Mr. Obasanjo had more than five minutes to explain what the third world was seeking at these meetings, he said:
"The wishes of the developing world are simple. We are all living in the same house, whether you are developed or not developed. What we are saying is that some of us in this house are living in superluxurious rooms; others are living in something not better than an unkempt kitchen where pipes are leaking and there is no toilet. We are saying, 'Look, in the interest of all of us, let us living in the superluxurious rooms pay a bit of attention to those who are living where the pipes are leaking, or we'll all be badly affected.'
"That's the message."
There were repeated warnings to heed the dark side of globalization, the technology and health gaps as well as the unbalanced use of natural resources. There were also calls for a more democratic United Nations, with a Security Council more reflective of a membership that has changed profoundly since the organization's founding in 1945.
"If we want this United Nations organization to fulfill its lofty goals, indeed if we want it to remain relevant in the 21st century," Prime Minister Said W. Musa of Belize said in his speech, "we must remake it into an organization that takes global governance away from the self-appointed few and brings greater democracy to all its operations."
A number of speakers took the opportunity to float their own international initiatives.
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia proposed a project in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency to destroy radioactive materials and exclude them from civilian energy use. He also suggested that the 40th anniversary next spring of the first manned space flight -- by a Russian -- be commemorated by an international conference on the prevention of the military uses of space.
Both Mr. Putin and President Jiang were robbed of their biggest arms-control target, the proposed American nuclear missile defense, when Mr. Clinton delayed deployment last week. Mr. Putin did reaffirm the importance that Russia attaches to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which many nations say would be directly threatened by a new American system.
The angriest speaker of this first day of the summit meeting was probably Prime Minister Lester B. Bird of Antigua, who went on the attack against the Group of 7 industrialized nations and the larger Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for their efforts to tighten or close down tax havens.
"While the spin doctors of the O.E.C.D. have attempted to cloak their position in moral rectitude with references to the evils of money laundering," he said, "harmful tax competition has nothing to do with money laundering." He said the campaign was a ploy by "what amounts to a high-tax cartel" of rich nations.
His passion illustrated the difficulties in selling international financial regulation to those countries that believe they can only stand to lose when rules are tightened.
There were some overtones of sadness and poignancy in many of today's 60-plus speeches. Starting with Secretary General Annan, there were condemnations of the killings of three international aid workers, and perhaps a fourth, in West Timor by rampaging Indonesian militias. Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman Wahid, whose nation's army and police patrol the island to prevent trouble, sat impassively in the hall. (He speaks on Thursday.)
President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair called attention to the plight of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese democracy leader, who is enduring a new round of repression under a military junta that robbed her of an election victory a decade ago.
"I do not wish to leave the U.N. without saying this," Mr. Blair said. "The treatment of Aung San Suu Kyi by the Burmese regime is a disgrace. I call on the Burmese government to let her go free, and I call on fellow world leaders to back that call."
It was left to President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom of the Maldives to plumb the existential depths, as he spoke for those island nations threatened with extinction in rising seas caused by global warming. "When the U.N. meets to usher in yet another century," he said, "will the Maldives and other low-lying nations be represented here?"
As his five minutes ended, he added: "My time at the podium is up. But I pray that that of my country is not."

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Chinese Withdraw 6 Runners And Coach

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Thursday, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Ma Junren, the controversial coach of China's female distance runners, was removed from the Olympic team along with six of his athletes following suspicious results in domestic drug tests, Chinese officials said today.
A total of 27 Chinese athletes have been withdrawn from the Sydney Games for reasons that include failed drug tests, injury and illness, He Zhenliang, a member of the International Olympic Committee's executive board from China, said in an interview. 
 The official Xinhua news agency quoted a representative of the Chinese Olympic Committee as saying there were "multiple reasons" for the dismissal of Ma and his runners.
"Some of them are dropped due to suspicious blood test results," said the representative, He Huixian.
A representative for the Chinese track and field federation told The Associated Press in Beijing that six of seven runners that Ma trained had been removed "because of blood tests." The most prominent of the runners was Dong Yanmei, the former world record-holder in the women's 5,000 meters.
Chinese officials have not said exactly how many of the 27 removed athletes had failed drug tests. Yesterday, they acknowledged that seven rowers had tested for high levels of red blood cells, an indication of the use of the endurance drug EPO, which stimulates the production of the oxygen-carrying corpuscles.
A test for EPO will be used for the first time at the Sydney Games. He, the I.O.C. delegate, said the athletes who tested positive were dropped for two reasons. One, China is seeking to be host for the 2008 Summer Games and wanted to avoid the potential embarrassment of athletes, being caught cheating here. Also, China has made a strong effort to curb cheating after more than three dozen Chinese athletes tested positive in the last decade, He said.
"Everything is related," He said of the dismissals. "I think it was a good decision the part of the Chinese Olympic Committee. It will protect the health of the athletes and will assure that the contributions of the Chinese to the Games will be clean."
Thirteen Chinese coaches and officials have also been withdrawn from the Olympic team.
The withdrawal of the Chinese athletes -- 14 in track and field, 7 rowers, 4 swimmers and 2 kayakers -- is significant, considering that only 48 doping suspensions have been carried out at the Summer Games since testing began in 1968. Ma's dismissal confirmed the suspicions of many American runners, who remained skeptical that the record-shattering performances achieved by Chinese women could have been fueled only by diets of turtle soup and worm fungus, as Ma claimed.
"Regrettably, this casts doubt on the performances by all his athletes," said Craig Masback, the chief executive officer of the United States track and field federation.
Ma had a complicated and often contentious relationship with Chinese authorities and his own runners. Chinese women shattered world records at 1,500, 3,000 and 10,000 meters in 1993 and came to be known as Ma's Army. His runners were peasants from Lianong Province who were subjected to brutal training methods, including running up to a marathon a day. But the women later mutinied.
Wang Junxia left Ma before she won the 5,000 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, claiming that he took a Mercedes-Benz the runners had earned by winning the 1993 world track and field championships and that he had treated them abusively in training.
In a centralized sports system, Ma also clashed with the state authorities by seeking unauthorized corporate sponsorship for a training center. His runners were prevented from participating in the 1997 world championships and the 1998 Asian Games.
Ma made a comeback after the Chinese women fared poorly at those Asian Games, but his career appears now to be in jeopardy. "He's a good coach, but he's sometimes very controversial, bad tempered, cunning," He said. "But there was no retribution against anyone."
Instead, Ma has come to represent what Chinese officials say is a doping problem that exists in the provinces but is not state-sponsored. Contact with coaches from other countries and prize and sponsorship money allowed in China's market economy has "been a lure to the bad mind of some coaches and athletes," He said.
American runners said today that they welcomed the deterrent created by the EPO test.
"This is what people have been asking for," the distance star Adam Goucher said. "I hope this will scare people into being clean."

Tire Hearings Scrutinize Firestone and Ford Motor
Newly released documents provided additional evidence that Bridgestone/Firestone and possibly Ford Motor knew about a pattern of tire failures long before a recall was announced in August. 
 The disclosures came during a day of hearings on Capitol Hill at which lawmakers called for a larger budget for safety regulators and proposed federal criminal penalties for any future cases in which companies might be found to have knowingly sold products with lethal defects. Page A1.
 
F.T.C. Investigates Drug Companies
The Federal Trade Commission said that it was investigating whether Bristol-Myers Squibb and American Bioscience colluded to keep the lower-cost generic version of Bristol's cancer drug, Taxol, off the market. The Food and Drug Administration gave Ivax, a generic drug maker, tentative approval last month to sell generic Taxol. But regulators said they could not let Ivax sell the drug because of a complex legal agreement between Bristol-Myers and American Bioscience. The F.T.C. said in court papers that the terms of the agreement "raise potential competitive issues." Shares of Ivax rose $7.81, to $39. C6.
 
Novell to Eliminate 900 Jobs
Novell said that it would eliminate 900 jobs, or about 16 percent of its worldwide work force, to reduce costs. The company said it would take a pretax charge of $40 million to $50 million in its fourth quarter. C8.
 
Nasdaq Slides Again, but Dow Rises
A sell-off in semiconductor stocks drove the Nasdaq composite index down 129.84 points, or 3.1 percent, to 4,013.34. Other markets fared better, largely because of strength in a handful of financial stocks and in oil shares. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.83 points, or 1 percent, to 1,492.25. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 50.03 points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,310.64. C10.
 
Book Agent Leaves William Morris
Robert Gottlieb, one of the most powerful agents in book publishing, resigned as head of the William Morris agency's New York literary group to start his own agency and multimedia management company. C7.
 
Productivity Up 5.7% in Quarter
Productivity, a measure of how much a worker produces for each hour on the job, grew at a 5.7 percent annual rate from April through June, up from the 5.3 percent pace originally estimated, new data showed. C2.
 
Time Warner Buys Africana.com
Facing an uncertain climate for Internet start-ups, the founders of Africana.com, the Harvard University professors Henry Louis Gates Jr., left, and Kwame Anthony Appiah, have sold their venture to Time Warner. Professor Gates said the deal would help keep the Web site, one of many seeking a worldwide audience of African descent, alive. "The revenue model was slow to develop, let's put it that way," he said. "I would have become worried about its future by next year unless there was some dramatic turnaround." Terms of the deal were not announced. C2.
 
Heinz Issues a Profit Warning
H. J. Heinz said that its second-quarter profit would be lower than analysts expected, and its shares fell nearly 5 percent, to $35.44. C2.
 
Europe and U.S. in Trade Standoff
The European Union and the United States are holding fast in several trade disputes, their continued standoff threatening a more punishing confrontation between the two trading blocs, the world's biggest. C4.
 
Good Times May Fuel Regulation
In the past, bad times might be expected to lead to new regulations and protectionism as people turn to government as a source of security. That may no longer be true. In the United States, new regulations tend to come after prolonged periods of prosperity. When times are good, restrictions look relatively cheap. Virginia Postrel: Economic Scene. C2.

HEADLINE: Room for Compromise As Teacher Talks Open

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
The opening salvos were predictable.
As the union representing New York City teachers kicked off contract negotiations with the city yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani called for merit bonuses for teachers and the elimination of teacher tenure. Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, rejected those demands and said that city teachers needed salaries equal to those in suburban schools. 
 But behind the bravado that marked the beginning of contract talks, the union and the mayor both realize that they are entering into critical negotiations that will not only affect the lives of 78,000 teachers, but may also end up significantly changing instruction for 1.1 million public-school children. Because of the worsening teacher shortage, the strong economy and increasing pressure to hold schools more accountable, both sides are likely to make concessions that could significantly change how teachers are compensated, as well as the rules they work by.
Ms. Weingarten, for example, hinted that she was willing to experiment with a longer workday and year for teachers, perhaps starting with a small group of schools whose teachers agreed to the changes.
For his part, Mr. Giuliani acknowledged that teachers deserved fatter paychecks and that he had in fact set aside money to finance raises for city workers. But he said teachers needed to work at least one additional period a day. And as he has done for months, Mr. Giuliani said the most important raise would come in the form of merit pay for teachers whose students' performance improved.
"There has to be a recognition that not all teachers are equal," Mr. Giuliani said. "Because when you do that, say all teachers are equal, you reduce it to the lowest common denominator."
Noticeably quiet yesterday was Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, who attended the negotiating session with senior aides but refused to discuss his expectations for the new contract. Mr. Levy will probably play a crucial role at the bargaining table, trying to smooth relations between the mayor and the union while ensuring that parts of both sides' most important demands are met.
Like the union, Mr. Levy believes that New York City cannot attract nearly enough qualified teachers unless it significantly raises their base salary. On the other hand, he shares the mayor's desire for teachers to work longer hours and for principals to be able to remove the worst teachers without long bureaucratic delays.
Since Mr. Levy has good relationships with both the union and the mayor and empathizes with each side, he may be able to emerge from the negotiations with his most pressing need met: the ability to attract thousands of qualified teachers to his school system.
"Harold is in a perfect position to broker an innovative and educationally productive deal," said Robert Berne, vice president for academic and health affairs at New York University. "The mayor can get more productivity, the teachers can get more pay and Harold can get more qualified teachers."
But to get what he wants, Mr. Levy will have to be careful not to appear too sympathetic to either side. Mr. Giuliani fought Mr. Levy's appointment last winter on the ground that he was too cozy with the teachers' union. Mr. Levy has publicly distanced himself from the union in recent months, a move that some education officials described yesterday as a shrewd bargaining tactic.
Yesterday, Ms. Weingarten repeated what in recent months has become her mantra: that the city would be foolish not to raise salaries at least to match those in suburban school districts. City teachers are now paid $31,910 to $70,000 a year, with senior teachers earning up to 30 percent less than their suburban counterparts. But Ms. Weingarten also suggested that her members were willing to consider some changes in teacher work rules.
"We made many different proposals that showed a lot of openness to doing things differently," she said after the negotiating session, held at the city's Office of Labor Relations.
The only such proposal that Ms. Weingarten would publicly discuss was one that would allow a small number of the city's 1,100 schools to decide their own work rules, including the length of the school day and year. Teachers and principals would jointly decide on the rules, although Ms. Weingarten did not say exactly how it would work.
The Giuliani administration has frequently pointed to the the city's new contract with the school principals' union as a model for the teachers' contract. That agreement ended tenure for principals, required them to work a longer school day and eliminated their two-month summer vacation. In exchange, principals got a 33 percent pay raise.
But some education experts said yesterday that since teachers are not in managerial positions, as principals are, they need tenure protection. While most principals around the nation do not have tenure rights, most teachers do, Mr. Berne said. "It's a standard practice around the country, and teachers need it because they are in fact vulnerable to political whims," he said. "We would be noncompetitive without tenure."
As for the merit pay issue, it seems unlikely that the teachers' union will accept a system of rewarding individual teachers based on their students' performance. Ms. Weingarten said yesterday that it would "undermine the teamwork, collegiality and collaboration that is necessary for schoolwide improvement." Mr. Levy has also expressed misgivings about merit pay for individual teachers.
On the other hand, Ms. Weingarten has hinted that she would not resist a merit pay program that rewarded every teacher in a school in which student test scores improved. Such a program is a likely compromise, especially if the new contract also includes across-the-board raises.
"They could do a group incentive program and raise salaries in exchange for more year-round teaching," Mr. Berne said. "Merit pay will have some significance during the negotiations, but it's not going to be the make-it-or-break-it issue."

HEADLINE: Newark Group Seeks Downtown Development

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 6

 BODY:
The foundation started more than two years ago to help spur and direct further redevelopment after the New Jersey Performing Arts Center opened here is seeking developers to help create a downtown residential and retail district.
The New Newark Foundation, created by the philanthropist Raymond G. Chambers, hopes that the land it controls in downtown will be transformed with businesses and homes and that it will bridge two parts of the city: the area, on the east side, around the performing arts center, Penn Station, Riverfront Stadium and a proposed sports arena; and the area west of the city's main thoroughfare, Broad Street. 
 If the plan is successful, it could provide the round-the-clock street life that city officials and others say is necessary to sustain a downtown revival. The foundation hopes to reach out to the rather insular commuter campuses of Rutgers in Newark and its law school, the New Jersey Institute of Technology and the University of Medicine and Dentistry.
"Bringing in a population that is there 24 hours a day has been the key to downtown revitalization in other cities," said James A. Schmidt, the executive director of the foundation. "And as a private, nonprofit organization directing development, we have the ability to say what type of use is better without looking at the bottom line all the time."
Mr. Schmidt said a thick stack of brochures and planning studies were sent out to about 60 developers today, seeking proposals for the area controlled by the foundation: an eight-square-block area bound by Broad Street to the east, Washington Street to the west, Central Avenue to the north and Raymond Boulevard to the south.
Mayor Sharpe James applauded the call for proposals and said that it would be the first "real test" of what had up to now been "all talk and vision" from the foundation.
In the last two years the group has had two changes in leadership, which kept local officials wondering if it still had the backing and enthusiasm of Mr. Chambers. Mr. Chambers, who grew up in Newark, is one of the principal owners of the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils, as well as the chief benefactor of the performing arts center, which opened in 1997.
"There was a lot of talk and vision but they didn't do anything," said Mr. James. "I'm excited over these first positive steps at showing people that Newark can offer attractive and convenient downtown living."
Crucial to the foundation's vision for the area are two long-vacant, landmark buildings on Broad Street; retail development is planned on the ground floors, and residential development above. One is the squat, four-story, turn-of-the-century building that once housed the Hahne Department Store. The other is the adjacent Griffith Piano Company Building, a slender, 17-story structure adorned at the top with terra cotta harps and other musical instruments.
Both buildings have been vacant for nearly 25 years, casualties of the city's decline and the exodus of businesses after the 1967 riots.
The rest of the planned development area is made up of smaller, three- and four-story residential and commercial structures, some large and small vacant parcels. The idea is to keep the small, village-like scale of the area, Mr. Schmidt said.
Donald Eisen, executive vice president of Cushman and Wakefield, the commercial real estate brokers, called the plan "an iffy proposition" because Broad Street might prove too wide a chasm for the development that has fueled the city's renaissance so far. He said residential development closer to the performing arts center and the proposed arena might have more chance of success.
The conceptual plans for the redevelopment project was formulated over the last two years with the help of a consortium: Ehrenkrantz, Eckstut & Kuhn Architects; Mikesell & Associates; and Paulus, Sokolowski & Sartor engineers. The group hopes to choose a developer early next year, Mr. Schmidt said
Mary Ann Tighe, vice chairman of Insignia/ESG, a commercial real estate company, called the foundation's effort to pull the development energy to the west "a worthy goal." The market, she said, would judge the rest. "If the foundation is willing to accept lower prices for their property, they may be able to achieve their goal," she said. "And it seems as if they are looking at the long-term goal of making Newark healthier rather than at what the market is saying right now."

Gore Says Prosperity Will Fuel Economic Goals
President Al Gore offered his economic vision for the future, a book-length plan that hinged on optimistic fiscal forecasts and offered a mountain of detail.

HEADLINE: Abdul Nasution, 81, Politician And Indonesian General, Dies

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Abdul Haris Nasution, a soldier and politician who fought for Indonesia's independence from the Netherlands and may have missed a chance to lead his nation, died today in a Jakarta hospital. He was 81 and had been in a coma since a recent stroke.
General Nasution (pronounced na-SU-tyun) was a former army chief and cabinet minister who typified the Indonesian military's history of deep involvement in politics and internal security as well as defense, experts on Indonesian history said today. 
 Over the years, General Nasution held positions roughly analogous to the United States secretary of defense, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- sometimes simultaneously.
What was perhaps the pivotal moment of General Nasution's life came on the night of Sept. 30, 1965, when six generals were slain as renegade troops tried to overthrow President Sukarno. With bullets flying around him, General Nasution fled his Jakarta house in his pajamas, leaping over a wall into the Iraqi ambassador's residence next door. His 6-year-old daughter and an aide were shot to death, however.
That night started a blood-letting that went on for months as hundreds of thousands of Communists, suspected Communists and trade unionists were killed in reprisals.
General Nasution might have been able to seize power then by playing on sympathy, his fierce anti-Communism and the prestige he enjoyed for having been a guerrilla leader against the Dutch after World War II, Ed Masters, a former United States ambassador to Indonesia, said today.
"But he didn't," Mr. Masters said.
Instead, General Suharto moved to take over, accusing President Sukarno of leftist sympathies. General Suharto imposed an iron rule that lasted three decades. He brought economic development and political stability to Indonesia, making the world's fourth most populous country more self-sufficient and increasing literacy.
The price was suppression of personal freedom and dissent and, many critics charged, corruption that enriched the leader and his relatives while millions of people were still trapped in poverty.
"Indonesian history could have been different if General Nasution had become president," said Mr. Masters, the No. 3 person in the American Embassy in Indonesia from 1964 to 1968 and ambassador from 1978 to 1982.
Perhaps, Mr. Masters said, authoritarian rule was necessary for a while longer in a country that had known only that for more than 300 years under the Dutch and Japanese. But Mr. Masters, now president of the United States Indonesia Society, said he believed that General Nasution would have relaxed the government's hold far sooner than General Suharto.
Recalling a conversation with General Nasution three years ago, Mr. Masters said, "He bemoaned the fact that Indonesia had such rigid controls." General Nasution, he said, was basically "an honest man, an honorable man," one with no taste or talent for intrigue.
As his power was waning in 1966, President Sukarno removed General Nasution as defense minister, a post he had held for seven years.
Once General Suharto took over, General Nasution criticized him on more than one occasion. After the Iranian revolution of 1979, he said a similar upheaval could occur in Indonesia if the people no longer identified with their government.
Even out of official power, General Nasution retained enough prestige to say things that might have been fatal for a lesser figure. But his complaints had little effect.
Abdul Nasution was born on Sumatra of middle-class parents and graduated from the Royal Dutch Military Academy before World War II. He was commissioned in the Royal Netherlands Indies Army in 1941 and was captured by the Japanese the next year. He later worked as a civil administrator for the Japanese and joined a Japanese military unit, at least partly in hope of ending Dutch colonial rule.
When Indonesia proclaimed its independence after Japan was defeated, he rose rapidly in the new Indonesian Army, becoming a major general at 28. He led guerrilla campaigns against the Dutch and, after independence was secured, helped to put down rebellions against the new central government.
General Nasution is survived by his wife and daughter.
James Clad, a Georgetown University professor of Southeast Asian studies, said today that General Nasution dedicated himself to "a struggle for a better life" for Indonesians, and that he was fundamentally "a voice of moderation."
Sidney Jones, the Asian director of Human Rights Watch, said that, courage and good intentions notwithstanding, General Nasution helped to cement the internal political role of the military that has haunted Indonesia.
Asked how he thought the general would be remembered, Mr. Masters mentioned again the night of the 1965 coup. "The time came, and it passed him by," he said. "He was an Indonesian Hamlet."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: BEHIND THE NUMBERS;
Debating Detailed Plans for Hypothetical Money

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
In releasing a detailed economic blueprint today, Vice President Al Gore reignited a debate with Gov. George W. Bush about who can better apportion the projected federal budget surplus without driving the government back into the red and running the good economy off the rails.
By making selective assumptions about which tax and spending proposals to include and how to put a price on them, both presidential campaigns can produce bottom lines suggesting that theirs is the path of fiscal prudence and their opponent's the first step toward economic ruin. 
 The money the two sides are playing with is only hypothetical at this point, and for all the numbers flying back and forth, the issue is not really arithmetic. What matters is the clear difference in approach to economic management and use of the surplus between the two parties and their candidates.
Mr. Bush for the most part represents conservative orthodoxy, with a heavy emphasis on tax cuts, keeping politicians from getting their hands on too much money and relying on individuals and markets to solve problems and strengthen the economy.
In his view, tax cuts are a powerful way to improve the chance that the economy will continue to grow over the long term. Reducing the national debt, while an important goal, is not a singular priority.
After spending much of the past several months campaigning as a corporation-bashing populist fighting for working families, Mr. Gore presented himself today as the embodiment of fiscal responsibility, brushing aside the Bush camp's accusations that he is a recklessly big-spending liberal.
Mr. Gore emphasized his willingness to take some money out of contention for either tax cuts or additional spending, vowing to set aside $300 billion of the projected surplus over the next 10 years in case the surplus does not materialize as projected.
If the money materializes, it would go to additional debt reduction; if it does not, it would not have been promised for any particular use and thus would not be contributing to any new deficit.
The 191-page document released today by Mr. Gore was written largely by economic advisers closely associated with the Clinton administration's emphasis on keeping the budget balanced and paying off the national debt.
They included Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary, who colleagues said has sometimes been uncomfortable with Mr. Gore's recent populist emphasis; Gene Sperling, the White House economic policy adviser; Erskine B. Bowles, the former White House chief of staff; and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a former White House chief economist and policy adviser.
Those advisers generally see the strong economy as Mr. Gore's best weapon, and reducing the debt as the best way of keeping interest rates low and stimulating the investment the economy needs to remain the world's most competitive.
Yet even as he presented himself as a man of economic prudence, Mr. Gore sketched a vision of an activist government willing to take on big problems. The document he released today sought to spell out for voters, with considerable specificity, how Mr. Gore would seek to harness continued prosperity on their behalf.
Incomes would rise by a third, Mr. Gore promised. The poverty level would decline to less than 10 percent, from 12.7 percent. College attendance and graduation rates would increase. Income-tax rates on families making the median income would fall. The disparity between what men and women earn would be reduced by 50 percent.
Mr. Gore described not just the goals, but the programs and policies he said would be necessary to achieve them, from paying off the national debt to spending $115 billion more on education in the next decade and establishing a new retirement savings program at a cost of at least $200 billion.
Whether the goals are achievable is largely a matter of how well the economy does in coming years, a variable mostly outside the control of any president.
The current business expansion is already the longest the nation has ever enjoyed. Should the combination of healthy growth, low unemployment and higher productivity continue for another eight years -- by no means a certainty, even if the president, Congress and the Federal Reserve make all the right choices -- many if not all of Mr. Gore's goals could be within reach.
Should the economy hit the rocks, they could come back to haunt a President Gore.
The entire exercise was striking for the degree of detail it involved.
Eight years ago, Bill Clinton offered an economic policy agenda titled "Putting People First." It was praised for, if nothing else, being detailed and concrete about his plans and priorities. In its original form, it was a few dozen pages long, an airy pamphlet alongside Mr. Gore's chart-laden presentation.
Mr. Bush has not pulled his proposals together in a comprehensive document. But his campaign released a detailed accounting of his tax and spending plans today, right down to his proposed spending increase for aid to historically black colleges and universities ($900 million over 10 years).
Mr. Bush counterpunched hard, citing support for his approach from conservative, Nobel Prize-winning economists like Milton Friedman, and asserting that Mr. Gore's long list of initiatives would blow a hole in the budget.
But Mr. Gore's camp is happy to have the campaign fought over economic management issues, seeing that as ground on which Mr. Gore is both comfortable and right.
It remains unclear how much credit voters will give to the vice president for the current prosperity -- whether, as is traditionally the case, the good times will lead voters to think hard before throwing the incumbent party out of the White House.
Mr. Gore left little doubt about how he wants to put prosperity to work, but some of his more ambitious goals were vaguely defined.
He said he would seek to create 10 million "high-tech, high-skill" jobs during the next decade. But he did not define how those jobs would differ from other jobs, or how much better they would presumably pay than flipping hamburgers.
And his prescription for creating them encompassed such broad initiatives as improving education and training and continuing to open new foreign markets to American goods and services.
He said he would work to raise family incomes by a third over 10 years, largely by fostering continued improvement in the growth rate of productivity, the basic measure of economic efficiency. As productivity increases, wages and profits can rise without setting off inflation, and much of the economy's recent strength can be traced to productivity improvements.
But there is no simple recipe for nurturing productivity.
Productivity dropped sharply in the early 1970's for reasons that economists still do not fully understand, and has rebounded only in the past few years. The spread of computers and other information technology has obviously played a role, but no one knows for sure how long the improvement will last.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN NEW YORK;
The Words of Many Government Leaders, and Many Views of the World

 BODY:
These are excerpts from speeches of world leaders yesterday at the United Nations, drawn from official transcripts:
 
'There can be change. There can be hope for Africa.'
TONY BLAIR
Prime Minister, Britain
There is a dismal record of failure in Africa on the part of the developed world that shocks and shames our civilization. Twenty-one of the 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa are affected by conflict which undermines efforts at development. Even worse, 10 times as many people died of AIDS in Africa last year as were killed in all continent's wars combined. 
 Nowhere are more people dying needlessly from starvation, from disease, from conflict. Deaths caused not by acts of fate, but by acts of man. By bad governance, factional rivalries, state-sponsored theft and corruption.
Nowhere are more people being left behind on the wrong side of a growing digital and educational divide, children being denied the opportunities that will transform the lives of their contemporaries elsewhere in the world. Yet, 30 years ago, the same depressing analysis might have been made of parts of Asia or Latin America. There can be change. There can be hope for Africa.
There is political leadership, business opportunity and above all the will on behalf of people for a better future in Africa. We must be partners in the search for change and hope.
 
'Blind laws are offered like divine norms.'
FIDEL CASTRO
President, Cuba
There is chaos in our world, both within the countries' borders and beyond. Blind laws are offered like divine norms that would bring peace, order, well-being and the security our planet so badly needs. That is what they would have us believe.
Three dozen developed and wealthy nations that monopolize the economic, political and technological power have joined us in this gathering to offer more of the same recipes that have only served to make us poorer, more exploited and more dependent.
There is not even discussion about a radical reform of this old institution -- born over a half-century ago when there were few independent nations -- to turn into a true representative body of the interests of all the peoples on Earth; an institution where no one would have the irritating and anti-democratic right of veto and where a transparent process could be undertaken to expand membership and representation in the Security Council, an executive body subordinated to the General Assembly, which should be the one making the decisions on such crucial issues as intervention and the use of force.
It should be clearly stated that the principle of sovereignty cannot be sacrificed to an abusive and unfair order that a hegemonic superpower uses, together with its own might and strength, to try to decide everything by itself. That Cuba will never accept.
 
'A moral and humane world with liberty and progress.'
MOHAMMAD KHATAMI
President, Iran
Democratic principles have gradually become the criteria of good-governance domestically. They deserve to become the new norm governing global interactions.
Therefore, the exigencies of a few power holders should not supersede the interest of humanity through familiar practices of endorsement of undemocratic governments, not responsive to the will and needs of their people, and application of double and multiple standards of response to incidents around the globe.
Moreover, the structure of power in our contemporary world must be reformed. In a global society whose constituents, much like equal individuals within nation-states, are nations of equal right and dignity, diverse cultures and civilizations can and should work collectively to build a moral and humane world with liberty and progress for all.
 
'We live in a society, not a marketplace.'
BERTIE AHERN
Prime Minister, Ireland
The statistics of poverty and inequality in our world are shocking and shameful.
Half the world's population struggling on less than $2 a day; over a billion on less than $1.
A quarter of a billion children of 14 and under working, sometimes in terrible conditions.
Death from preventable and treatable diseases; 10 people will die of malaria in the five minutes I take to address you. There was much talk some years ago of a "new world order."
A new order is indeed dawning. The capacity of globalization to transform our economies and societies is enormous.
But, unless shaped by a value system, globalization will mean an ever more lopsided world. The level playing field will remain an illusion as long as a majority of players are ill fed, ill trained and ill equipped.
Perhaps the phrase "fair world order" better sums up what we should strive for. It recognizes that we live in a society, not a marketplace. It admits concepts of justice and human solidarity. It acknowledges that, while not everyone will live in the same way, we are all entitled to dignity and decency.
 
'At the Rubicon, and neither of us can cross it alone.'
EHUD BARAK
Prime Minister, Israel
The opportunity for peace in the Middle East is now at hand, and must not be missed.
We envision a peace that will preserve the vital interests and the dignity of all sides. But no one side can achieve 100 percent of its dreams if we are to succeed.
My own government has shown, in negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians, as in our full implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, that it can make painful decisions for the sake of peace.
It remains to be seen whether our counterparts are also capable of rising to the magnitude of the hour.
The member states of the United Nations can lend a pivotal hand by encouraging the difficult process of reconciliation, and by opposing any unilateral measures, which may well spark a renewed cycle of violence and obliterate the prospects of peace.
I call out to Chairman Arafat to join me in this historic passage.
We are at the Rubicon, and neither of us can cross it alone.
 
'New horizons for secure life on the planet.'
VLADIMIR V. PUTIN
President, Russia
The new century of the United Nations should prolong itself into a millennium of effective stability. It has to enter the annals of history as the period of real disarmament. . . .
We should reliably block the ways for spreading of nuclear weapons. We can achieve this by, inter alia, excluding usage of enriched uranium and pure plutonium in the world atomic energy production.
This is technically quite possible to implement. But more important is that incineration of plutonium and other radioactive elements creates prerequisites for the final solution of the radioactive residues problem. It opens fundamentally new horizons for secure life on the planet.
In this connection Russia proposes to work out and put into practice a relevant mechanism with the participation of the I.A.E.A. Particularly alarming are the plans for militarization of the outer space. In spring of 2001 we shall celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first flight of man to the outer space.
That man was our compatriot, and we suggest to organize on that date, under the umbrella of the U.N., an international conference on prevention of the outer space militarization. I think that the most proper place for it shall be Moscow.
 
'As part of a global village, we should work together.'
HASINA WAZED
Prime Minister, Bangladesh
Can we afford islands of prosperity in an ocean of suffering and darkness? Let us resolve that as part of a global village, we should work together so that all can benefit from the process of globalization and we can have a win-win at the end.
Globalization and a borderless world are not a panacea for all social and economic ills. While they can reinforce the rich and the powerful, they can also impoverish the weak and the vulnerable.
 
'We all know that the U.N. plays a major role.'
JACQUES CHIRAC
President, France
Our world, which is still fraught with political, economic and financial crises, does not suffer from a surfeit of rules, but from the problems of keeping international law and practices abreast of change and progress.
If we are to build a world order that meets the needs of our times, we must strengthen and improve the coexistence of great institutions such as I.M.F., the World Bank, the W.T.O. and, first of all, the U.N.
We all know that the U.N. plays a major role. In its first half-century of existence, this universal, democratic institution has become irreplaceable.
We must let it adapt to today's world. By modernizing the methods of the General Assembly, which is the world's Parliament in a way. By supporting the reforms undertaken by our secretary general, Mr. Kofi Annan, whom I would like to salute here. By making the best use of the information revolution.
And finally, by providing the necessary resources, as the European Union countries do, supplying more than one-third of the budget and half of the financing for U.N. funds and programs. This will enable the U.N. to fulfill its duties and influence the course of world history.
 
'There should not be only one color in the universe.'
JIANG ZEMIN
President, China
The world is diverse and colorful. Just as there should not be only one color in the universe, so there should not be only one civilization, one social system, one development model or one set of values in the world.
Each and every country and nation has made its own contribution to the development of human civilization. It is essential to fully respect the diversity of different nations, religions and civilizations, whose co-existence is the very source of vigorous development in the world.
We should promote the exchanges between different civilizations in a spirit of equality and democracy and encourage them to learn from one another in order to attain common progress.
Dialogue and cooperation in the field of human rights must be conducted on the basis of respect for state sovereignty. This is the fundamental and most effective way to protect and promote human rights.
So long as there are boundaries between states, and people live in their respective countries, to maintain national independence and safeguard sovereignty will be the supreme interests of each government and people. Without sovereignty, there will be no human rights to speak of.
 
'Inaction speaks louder than words.'
MAUMOON ABDUL GAYMOOM
President, Maldives
To those who learn from mistakes the past is a good guide for the future. But let us not go back a thousand years. Let us go forward to a hundred years hence.
When the U.N. meets to usher in yet another century, will the Maldives and other low-lying island nations be represented here?
Not only a sobering thought, but an alarming one.
Now, I have only 30 seconds left. It would be a pity to disperse from this gathering without a final commitment to save the earth. I don't wish to be cynical, but, are we to believe that the world really cares? Are we to believe that all humanity is one?
Inaction speaks louder than words.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN NEW YORK: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Warns U.N. of a New Age of Civil Wars

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton opened the summit meeting of world leaders at the United Nations today, urging the huge gathering to prepare the institution for a new age in which international forces will have to reach regularly and rapidly inside national boundaries to protect threatened people.
With his own time in the front rank of the 149 world leaders gathered here drawing to an end, Mr. Clinton also used the moment to try to settle some of the disputes that have dogged his presidency, from the Middle East to Russia to Southeast Asia. Excerpts, Page A16. 
 The president met separately into the evening with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and then with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, in hopes of picking up the broken pieces of the peace agreement to which they came tantalizingly close at Camp David in July. Mr. Clinton had warned earlier in the day that "like all life's chances," the moment for an accord "is fleeting and about to pass."
Tonight, the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, gave no indication that the meetings had resulted in any progress on the question of control of Jerusalem or other issues dividing Mr. Arafat and Mr. Barak. He said that as of now no meetings were scheduled this week among the three leaders.
Also today, Mr. Clinton sparred anew with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, who is using the gathering here to propose a ban on military uses of space, another effort to terminate American efforts to develop a national missile defense. Mr. Clinton's aides gave Mr. Putin a summary of American intelligence gathered during the Kursk submarine disaster, which suggests that Mr. Putin's own naval forces may have misled him in the days after the accident.
Mr. Clinton was deliberately vague on the question of when the United Nations should step into civil wars or ethnic and religious disputes -- an argument that has come up repeatedly during his presidency. "These conflicts present us with a stark challenge," he said. "Are they part of the scourge the U.N. was established to prevent? If so, we must respect sovereignty and territorial integrity, but still find a way to protect people as well as borders."
Just hours before he spoke, three United Nations relief workers were killed in West Timor, apparently by Indonesian militia forces. The news, underscoring the risks to United Nations workers as they insert themselves into uncontrolled disputes, put a chill on the opening ceremony. As the session began, the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, called for a minute of silence to remember the three international aid workers, as Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman Wahid, struggling with a clear erosion of his authority at home, sat in the hall.
Mr. Clinton clearly relished one of his last hurrahs as president in front of what the United Nations called the largest gathering of world leaders in history. Rarely has he had a chance to talk to both adversaries and allies at the same moment, a group as diverse as President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and President Fidel Castro of Cuba, who listened to Mr. Clinton but never got close enough to talk to him.
Mr. Clinton stayed in the hall after his speech and, because of an unexpected change in the order of speakers, heard President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, with whom the United States still has no formal dialogue, talk about the clash of Islamic and Western cultures.
As Mr. Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright sat listening at the back of the huge hall, Mr. Khatami declared that in coming years the world could no longer be ruled by "monopolies of power and capital," a clear reference to the United States. It was one of several expressions of frustration about America's global power that was a subtext of the gathering.
Shortly after Mr. Clinton spoke of the need to intervene strongly when a nation's leaders abuse their own people, the president of China, Jiang Zemin, described a very different concept of how the world should operate. "Respect for each other's independence and sovereignty is vital to the maintenance of world peace," he said.
Striking a theme often heard from Chinese leaders who fear that intervention in Kosovo or East Timor could provide the precedent for one day intervening in Tibet or Taiwan, Mr. Jiang added: "Dialogue and cooperation in the field of human rights must be conducted on the basis of respect for state sovereignty. Without sovereignty, there will be no human rights to speak of."
Perhaps because of the growing suspicions about America's use of that power -- or perhaps because of the constant conflict between the United Nations and Washington over the payment of dues to the organization -- Mr. Clinton did not receive the kind of standing ovation that greeted him in 1998. During his speech, he made an oblique reference to Washington's $1.7 billion in arrears to the United Nations, saying that as the organization expands its missions, "all these things come with a price tag, and all nations, including the United States, must pay it."
He also took a clear shot at conservative Republicans who have attacked the United Nations, saying, "Those in my country or elsewhere who believe we can do without the United Nations, or impose our will upon it, misread history and misunderstand the future."
Shortly after Mr. Clinton spoke, he met in the United Nations building with the president of Vietnam, Tan Duc Luong. He reassured him that a recent trade accord between the United States and its enemy of three decades ago would remain a top priority for the United States, even though he has decided not to try to win approval of the agreement from Congress this year. The two men also discussed Mr. Clinton's desire to visit Vietnam before the end of his presidency, which would make him the first American president to set foot on Vietnamese soil since the end of the war nearly 30 years ago.
While the White House made no announcement of such plans, senior administration officials say Mr. Clinton is likely to visit Vietnam just before Thanksgiving. He is planning to attend the annual Asian economic summit meeting in Brunei, and would make a symbolic -- and highly emotional -- visit to Hanoi on the same trip.
Such individual meetings and initiatives always dominate the opening of the United Nations session in September. But the stated purpose of this vast meeting of leaders is much broader: to set new priorities and directions for the United Nations, which at age 55 seems creaky and unprepared for a host of new challenges.
On Friday the leaders are scheduled to sign a millennium declaration, calling for a new peacekeeping structure; a report to Mr. Annan calls for a strengthened corps of commanders in New York, ready to organize peacekeeping operations in a week or two. The declaration also sets goals for reducing poverty and illiteracy during the next 15 years, and contains carefully formulated language about guiding economic globalization so that it benefits the poor as much as the rich, and small, uncompetitive nations as much as the developed world.
But as with any document that is signed by so many, the language is so watered down that discerning its specific meaning is difficult at best. And it is particularly difficult to pin down the United Nations' role in managing economic globalization and development. More and more, that role has fallen to the institutions that were created at the end of World War II to manage the world economy -- the World Bank, which focuses on poverty, and the International Monetary Fund, which seeks to prevent and manage economic crises.
Their growing role leaves the United Nations increasingly on the sidelines when it comes to the crucial questions of economic development -- who gets capital and under what conditions -- and even their efforts are often overshadowed by the billions in private capital that now slosh through the emerging markets on a daily basis.
In such an environment, the United Nations' role is chiefly hortatory. And exactly because the United Nations does not impose the kind of conditions on its aid that the World Bank and I.M.F. require, from fiscal prudence to Western-style accounting methods -- it has become the forum to which many nations want to move the debate over the rules of globalization.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
Bush Says That the Bottom Line on Gore's Proposals Would Consume the Surplus

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush opened a new line of attack against his Democratic rival today, accusing Vice President Al Gore of making so many promises in this campaign that he would devour the entire $4.6 trillion federal surplus projected for the next decade.
Mr. Bush chose to fight on the economy and fiscal policy on a day when Mr. Gore unveiled an ambitious and detailed economic blueprint and called for the creation of a $300 billion rainy day fund to be set aside as an emergency source of money if the economy slows down. 
 The Bush campaign took out a full page advertisement in some regional editions of USA Today quoting six Nobel laureates and nearly 300 other economists praising Mr. Bush's approach to fiscal policy. The Texas governor also seized on an analysis released by Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee, who said the cost of the vice president's programs could be as high as $906 billion more than he has estimated.
"I want America to add up all the promises my opponent has made," Mr. Bush told a crowd at an early morning airport rally in Scranton, Pa. "All the promises over the course of this campaign. He has the easy style of campaigning. Go to one community and make a promise here, go to another community. When you add it all up, he's spent the entire surplus on bigger government. He won't admit it."
Mr. Bush stood before a large blowup poster of the USA Today advertisement and used it to contrast his economic plan with Mr. Gore's.
"My plan has been endorsed by these Nobel prize winners and leading economists," Mr. Bush said. "His plan has been endorsed by Bill Clinton."
Mr. Bush's accusations were a mirror image of the Gore campaign's own assertions that it is the Republican candidate who is threatening the surplus because of his proposal to enact a $1.3 trillion tax cut over 10 years, and his spending programs. When Mr. Bush unveiled a $198 billion plan on Tuesday to change the Medicare system, Mr. Gore said, "There is no money to pay for it if you give away all of the surplus in the form of a giant tax cut for the wealthy."
At every campaign rally Mr. Bush is now featuring blue-collar families who he says would receive large reductions under his tax cut plan but would get little to nothing from Mr. Gore's proposals for smaller, more targeted tax cuts for such expenses as college education or home health care.
"We trust you with your money," Mr. Bush told crowds today as he promoted his tax cut in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Indiana. "We trust you to make decisions with your lives. We don't trust bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. We don't believe in planners and deciders making decisions on behalf of America."
At another airport rally here he appropriated Mr. Gore's theme of helping "working families" and thundered, "Guess which plan is on the side of the working people? It's our plan. It's our plan."
Mr. Bush's turn to economic themes today was echoed by his running mate, Dick Cheney, who campaigned before a chamber of commerce in Wilmington, Del. Mr. Cheney said he believed that the economic policies of President Ronald Reagan should get a strong measure of credit for the booming economy of the last eight years.
Answering a question from a member of the audience, Mr. Cheney compared Mr. Bush's tax cut proposal to Reagan's own income tax cuts of two decades ago, saying it was "exactly what we did to get this prosperity begun in the first place, back in the early 80's under President Reagan."
Later, speaking to reporters, Mr. Cheney said that the boom was created by 20 years of strong leadership of the Federal Reserve Board, reductions in military spending after the cold war and the tax policies of President Reagan and even those of President George Bush.
"My analysis would be a 20-year look at the economy and policy, not just the last eight years," he said.
Still later in the day, an aide said Mr. Cheney wanted to clarify that he also gave a measure of credit to President Clinton for "reluctantly signing" fiscal measures approved by the Republican Congress,
The argument over surpluses and deficits is a muddy one because accounts of how much each candidate will spend depends on estimates and projections.
The Senate Republican analysis found, for example, that Mr. Gore's proposals would overshoot the available surplus by as little as $27 billion over 10 years if the costs of Mr. Gore's spending plans are assumed to be at the low end of credible estimates.
If the costs of the spending plans are assumed to be at the high end of estimates, Mr. Gore's budget would be in the red by as much as $906 billion over 10 years, the report said. For example, the report noted that Mr. Gore says his plan to increase retirement savings would cost $200 billion over 10 years, while other estimates put the cost at as much as $750 billion. The Gore campaign dismissed the report as partisan.
The Bush campaign says that the governor's own plan leaves a $265 billion surplus. But John Cogan, an economics adviser to Mr. Bush, acknowledged today as he briefed reporters on Mr. Gore's spending, that the Bush figures do not account for the costs of deploying a missile defense system, but only for research and development. Mr. Bush has called for a far more robust system than the one that President Clinton had been contemplating at a cost of $60 billion.
Mr. Cogan argued that Mr. Bush could offset the cost with other military spending savings.
Mr. Bush also appeared today before the national convention of the American Legion, where he repeated calls for better military preparedness and better health care for veterans. Before he spoke, Alan Lance, the national commander, told the veterans' group that Mr. Gore had declined to appear before it because of a scheduling conflict.
Mr. Lance said the vice president had offered a substitute, but was turned down because it "isAl Gore Jr. who is running for president of the United States, not a substitute."
To applause, he added, "I believe you deserve better than that and America deserves better than that."

HEADLINE: In Two Weeks, Lazio's Tax Plan Undergoes Deductions of Its Own

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: GREECE, N.Y. Sept. 6

 BODY:
With television cameras and photographers crowded around him, Representative Rick A. Lazio settled behind a green plastic picnic table in the Caracci family backyard here to talk up what he calls the most dramatic component of his tax cut plan: allowing taxpayers to deduct their payroll tax from their federal income taxes.
"If you had an extra twelve hundred bucks, what would you do with it?" the Suffolk County Republican asked four Rochester area taxpayers recruited by his campaign for an orchestrated conversation designed to draw attention to the tax cut that he has presented as a cornerstone of his campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
 But the tax plan Mr. Lazio promoted again today was not precisely what he first proposed two weeks ago, his aides acknowledge. The aides have offered some new details on the plan since then, the effect being to lower the plan's potential cost. Those changes occurred as some of Mr. Lazio's economic assumptions were challenged by some independent analysts, and after Mrs. Clinton's aides said he underestimated the plan's price tag so he could distance himself from the $1.3 trillion tax cut proposed by George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate.
The payroll tax deduction that Mr. Lazio has proudly highlighted in his speeches would, in fact, be phased in over 10 years, meaning that it would be 2011 at the earliest before the four people seated at the table with Mr. Lazio today would get the $1,200 tax cut he promised. What is more, in a bit of tax policy that several independent analysts described as highly unusual and extraordinarily complicated, the tax deduction, for Social Security contributions, would only be permitted for taxpayers who, after computing their gross adjusted income, found themselves in or below the 28 percent income tax bracket. They would then proceed to subtract the additional deduction.
Without those provisions, the cost of making the payroll tax deductible would be $500 billion over 10 years. With these provisions, its 10-year cost would be about $300 billion.
The idea of making the payroll tax deductible has been considered, but discarded, in Congress, both because it is highly expensive and because deductions favor taxpayers in upper brackets. And in Albany, Frank J. Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a group that studies government finances, contended that Mr. Lazio's proposal, even with its upper-income limit restrictions, would still benefit wealthier taxpayers because they are statistically far more likely to itemize deductions.
Mr. Lazio made no mention of those restrictive provisions when he outlined what he described as a "bold" idea to the Chamber of Commerce in Amherst, N.Y., on Aug. 24, and there was no mention of it in the detailed briefing papers his campaign provided about the plan that day. "I propose allowing people to deduct their payroll taxes on our 1040 forms -- the same way we do our state income taxes and real estate taxes," he said in his speech. "This pro-family tax cut will reduce the average two-income family's tax bill by $1,200."
At a news conference afterward, Mr. Lazio described his tax plan in even more generous terms, saying that with other provisions -- including the elimination of the so-called marriage penalty, and an increase in the amounts families are allowed to contribute to IRA's -- the average family would save close to $3,000 a year. Bryan W. Flood, one of Mr. Lazio's senior advisers, said that these provisions were always part of Mr. Lazio's plan, though Mr. Flood acknowledged that the candidate did not mention them in his speech, or in appearances since then.
"There was no intention to mislead," Mr. Flood said. 'We talked about about the fact that the payroll tax deduction plan is aimed at lower and middle-income voters. In retrospect, I guess, we could have been more clear about that. But certainly we're talking about it as a middle-class tax cut."
Mr. Flood said disputes about numbers aside, Mr. Lazio had put forward the plan as a way to draw one of the sharpest distinctions between the congressman and Mrs. Clinton: How much of the nation's surplus should be used for tax cuts. The first lady has offered a much more modest, and less detailed, tax cut plan that adheres to the Democratic program that would provide targeted tax cuts for specific income groups.
"One of the ideas of putting out an economic plan is to spark a discussion of the candidates' approach to economic issues and taxes," Mr. Flood said.
Several elements of Mr. Lazio's tax cut plan are under fire from analysts and Democrats, who contend that their costs are significantly understated. From a political perspective, this is more than just a bookkeeping dispute because Mr. Lazio has gone to some lengths to distinguish his plan from the $1.3 trillion plan offered by Mr. Bush, putting the cost of his own plan at $776 billion over 10 years.
For example, he put the cost of eliminating the marriage penalty at $89 billion. But analysts said that figure accounts for just the five-year cost of the tax cut: the 10-year cost is $293 billion, according to the bipartisan Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. Similarly, Mr. Lazio put the cost of repealing part of the Social Security tax at $56 billion. Mr. Flood acknowledged, though, that that figure was "several years old"; the joint committee's estimate is $117 billion over 10 years.
Mr. Flood said that his campaign stood by its estimates, suggesting the different views were nothing more than customary disputes between Congressional Democrats and Republicans over numbers. If Mr. Lazio were to accept the Congressional figures, the cost of his plan would clearly jump over $1 trillion, complicating his efforts to distinguish himself from Mr. Bush and providing Mrs. Clinton with a clearer target.

HEADLINE: U.S. Urges OPEC to Increase Oil Production

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
With oil prices surging to their highest level in a decade, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson called on oil-exporting nations today to increase their production.
"My hope is that OPEC seriously considers increasing production," Mr. Richardson said, referring to the 11-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
 As crude oil prices rose to $34.90 a barrel in New York today -- the highest level since the 1990 military buildup before the Persian Gulf war -- Mr. Richardson said that energy costs were "unacceptably high." American officials voiced concerns that home heating oil prices this winter could be 30 percent more than they were last year.
In remarks to reporters, Mr. Richardson said OPEC should increase production enough to reduce prices to $20 to $25 a barrel or risk further disrupting the world economy. OPEC ministers are scheduled to meet in Vienna on Sunday.
World markets "are very clearly insisting that there's not enough oil on the market to bring stability," Mr. Richardson said.
The Clinton administration is under increasing pressure to do something about oil prices. The White House has prepared a contingency plan to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, although it has not yet acceded to demands from some lawmakers to do so.
On a trip in February to the Middle East, Mr. Richardson secured a promise from Saudi Arabia to raise its output. The Saudi oil minister reported today that his nation had increased production by an additional 600,000 barrels a day since July, a 7 percent increase.
American officials have so far declined to say exactly how much additional production they are seeking from OPEC nations.

HEADLINE: MORE INDICATIONS HAZARDS OF TIRES WERE LONG KNOWN

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Documents released today provided additional evidence that Bridgestone/Firestone and possibly Ford knew about a pattern of tire failures long before a recall was announced in August, and lawmakers began calling for tighter regulation of the auto and tire industries.
The disclosures came in a long day of hearings on Capitol Hill in which Masatoshi Ono, the chairman and chief executive of Bridgestone/ Firestone, the American unit of Bridgestone of Japan, read apologies in halting English. "I come before you to apologize to you, the American people and especially to the families who have lost loved ones in these terrible rollover accidents," Mr. Ono told senators in the morning, squeezing in a reference to what some tire industry officials describe as an excessive tendency of Ford Explorers to roll over when they lose a tire. 
 Republicans and Democrats alike refused to accept Firestone's apologies or each company's efforts to blame the other. Members of Congress accused both companies of having at least blithely ignored public safety, and perhaps of conspiring to do so. "Ford and Firestone had at a minimum a moral obligation to make sure that the products they sell to the American public and other people in other countries are safe," said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama. "And yet they both failed to bring this issue to consumers' and the federal government's attention, at the cost of dozens of lives, I am afraid."
The lawmakers also called for a larger budget for safety regulators and proposed federal criminal penalties for any future cases in which companies might be found to have sold products with lethal defects.
After Mr. Ono's statement, Ford's chief executive, Jacques Nasser, jabbed back at Firestone later in the day, saying, "This is a tire issue, not a vehicle issue."
But the central issue of the hearings was what did each company know and when. House investigators showed reporters a Firestone financial statement indicating that the tire maker had found a pattern of tire problems earlier than it had acknowledged. In the document, dated Jan. 19, 2000, Firestone's financial managers calculated that $1.84 million of the $2.88 million in claims in 1999 against the company for tread separation problems, or 64 percent, was for tires made at just one of its 10 North American factories.
The statement identified Firestone's factory in Decatur, Ill., as making the problem tires. Previously, Firestone said it had not noticed the problems in Decatur until early August, when Ford conducted an analysis of Firestone quality data.
Firestone is now recalling and replacing 6.5 million light truck tires installed mainly on Ford Explorers, including all 15-inch Wilderness tires made in Decatur for the Explorer since 1996. The Firestone data shows that the Decatur plant had its worst quality problems from 1994 through 1996, when hundreds of replacement workers were employed there during a long dispute between Firestone and its unionized workers.
Before the financial statement was disclosed, Gary Crigger, Firestone's executive vice president for business planning, told a Senate panel that Firestone had immediately notified regulators in early August upon becoming aware of a problem.
Representative Heather A. Wilson, Republican of New Mexico, challenged Firestone officials this evening on why their safety officials did not act if the company's financial staff was aware of a problem. "So you looked at it from a financial point of view and not a consumer safety point of view?" she asked.
Mr. Crigger responded, "I'm sorry to say that's the case." Firestone switched production of tires for the Explorer from Decatur to other factories last January for reasons the company has never explained.
Ford also gave House investigators today a complete copy of an internal memorandum from March 1999, describing how the company handled the replacement of problem Firestone tires on Ford Explorers in Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, Congressional investigators gave reporters a copy of the memo with one section previously blacked out by Ford.
That version showed that Firestone officials had been leery of sending a letter to tire owners in Saudi Arabia for fear that it might have to inform the United States Transportation Department and that it might be banned from the Saudi market. "They feel that the U.S. D.O.T. will have to be notified of the program, since the same product is sold in the U.S.," the Ford memo said.
But in the section of the memo that was previously blacked out by Ford, the memo's author, a Ford official named Chuck Seilnacht, mentioned that a colleague at Ford shared Firestone's worries.
Corey MacGillivray, an official in the general counsel's office at Ford, "was concerned about the implications," as well, the memo said. "He was going to check with one of his colleagues to get more info."
Mr. Crigger said he had been aware of talks within Firestone's legal department of how to handle tire problems in Saudi Arabia but was not familiar with the details.
Unlike Firestone, Ford sent a letter to owners of Explorers in Saudi Arabia, several months after the memo, that they should get new tires, Mr. Nasser pointed out in testimony tonight. Ford also took out advertisements to promote the tire replacement and covered the program's expense after Firestone refused to do so on the ground that the tires were failing because of customers' misuse.
But Ford did not tell American regulators about the recall after Firestone officials assured the automaker that the tires did not pose a problem in the United States. Both companies still take that position: all tires replaced in Saudi Arabia were 16-inch Wilderness tires, a size that has not been recalled in the United States, though some plaintiffs' lawyers say they should be.
If Ford and Firestone knew of problems and did nothing, federal regulators could impose up to $925,000 in fines. But the companies and possibly their executives could face criminal charges by state and local prosecutors, who could accuse them of culpability in deaths that occurred after the companies clearly became aware of problems, said Joan Claybrook, who was administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration under President Jimmy Carter and is now the president of Public Citizen, an advocacy group. A prosecutor in Indiana tried to charge Firestone officials with criminal negligence after the company's huge tire recall in 1978 but was unsuccessful, she said.
If the public comes to perceive Ford and Firestone as culpable, that could also help plaintiffs' lawyers win larger punitive damages in lawsuits against the companies. The biggest potential damage to both companies, however, is that their images could be so sullied that customers start shying away from their products. Ford and Firestone both say that their August sales showed little effect from the recall, but some independent tire dealers say that many customers are now avoiding Firestone tires.
Ford officials said today that they had repeatedly asked Firestone over the last two years to check the tires for defects and had been assured every time that any problems had resulted solely from customers' abuse of the tires. But senators and representatives were unsympathetic, saying that Ford had a responsibility to make sure that it put safe tires on vehicles.
"Ford, too, when faced with hundreds of complaints of major tire defects on the Explorer, failed to respond with the sense of urgency that one would expect when the safety of so many people rested on its shoulders," said Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., Republican of Virginia.
Mr. Nasser announced tonight that Ford would set up an "early warning" system with the tire industry to identify tire problems as they emerge. He also said Ford would tell United States regulators of all foreign recalls.
Proposals by lawmakers today emphasized harsher punishment for violators of safety rules and closer government monitoring of the auto industry, with little attention to new safety rules for tires. A few of the proposals put forward were so far-reaching that even safety activists spoke against them at the hearings.
Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, proposed that the Transportation Department assign inspectors to auto factories much as the Agriculture Department assigns inspectors to chicken processors, and that automakers be required to forward their quality-control data to the government. Ms. Claybrook said that regulators did not have the staff necessary for such an ambitious undertaking.
Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said that he planned to introduce legislation as soon as Thursday to establish federal criminal penalties, possibly including second-degree manslaughter, for the executives of companies that knowingly sell defective products that kill consumers. Automakers narrowly turned back a similar measure in 1966, when the nation's auto regulatory system was set up.
Violations of federal auto safety rules are currently punished with a fine of the manufacturer of no more than $925,000, plus a mandatory recall of the defective vehicle, auto part or tire.
Senator Shelby, who is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee for transportation, which held one of today's hearings, said he would consider an immediate increase in the budget of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department. The agency's budget was cut almost in half at the beginning of the Reagan administration and remains a third lower than it was in the Carter administration, after adjusting for inflation.
For years, auto defects have received little attention on Capitol Hill. Sue Bailey, the safety agency's administrator, pointed out that it recommended on March 24 that Congress enact stiffer laws, including an increase in the limit on civil penalties to at least $1 million. No member of Congress has yet introduced a bill with these proposals, she added.
The current session of Congress is scheduled to end a month from today, with only 21 more working days. Bills and budget changes introduced this late in a session usually have little chance of passage, but Senators Specter and Shelby said in interviews that Congress and the nation were so interested in the tire issue that legislative action was possible and even probable.
The tire recall appears to have had fairly little effect on sales of sport utility vehicles. S.U.V. sales rose 5.1 percent in August from the level of a year earlier, while the overall auto market was flat. But all of the growth in sport utility sales occurred in small car-based models like the Chrysler PT Cruiser, which the auto industry classifies as sport utilities so as to qualify for the more lenient regulations that cover light trucks.
Sales of larger models like the Ford Explorer, which tend to be based on pickup designs, fell 0.9 percent in August, partly because the Explorer, the nation's top-selling sport utility, had a drop of 0.8 percent. Sales of pickup-based sport utilities soared in the mid-1990's, but the growth has been slowing since 1997.
"I see it leveling off; I don't see anything drastic happening," said Mark Cornelius, an auto sales analyst in West Olive, Mich.
 Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, said he would use the Firestone and Ford issue to seek quick passage of legislation barring companies from sealing information relevant to public safety in court settlements of lawsuits. Plaintiffs' lawyers contend that Ford and Firestone have hidden many documents with such secrecy orders.
Helen O. Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for safety and environmental issues, said Ford only sealed the amounts of settlements and did not seal engineering information.
Plaintiffs' lawyers said it does not appear that Bridgestone/Firestone has softened its litigation stance the last week, despite the threat of criminal prosecution in Venezuela, pressure from federal regulators to recall additional tires and blistering hearings in Congress.
The heightened scrutiny "has had no effect whatsoever," said Bruce R. Kaster, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Ocala, Fla., who has been a leader in suing Bridgestone/Firestone over tread separation problems. "There's no indication of any willingness on their part to soften their position on discovery or settlements or anything else." Firestone is only settling cases, he said, "when they start getting nervous."

An Overload On a Party Circuit
The powwow of presidents and other potentates at the United Nations is not just causing gridlock on the city's streets but also overloading the diplomatic party circuit.
The American ambassador to the United Nations, RICHARD C. HOLBROOKE, had a dinner on Tuesday night honoring the president of Mali, ALPHA OUMAR KONARE, whose country also holds the presidency of the Security Council this month. 
 President Konare decided to deliver his after-dinner remarks, hailing renewed Unites States attention to Africa, in French. With no official translators on hand, Mr. Holbrooke's wife, the writer KATI MARTON, stepped up to provide the simultaneous English version for guests like the REV. JESSE JACKSON, ED BRADLEY from CBS News and several African-American congressmen, including DONALD M. PAYNE of New Jersey.
The United States Secretary of State, MADELEINE K. ALBRIGHT, and one of her predecessors, HENRY A. KISSINGER, swept in late from another soiree to catch the end of the toast.
Not everyone in New York City is participating in the festivities, especially its most renowned nondiplomat, MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI. Asked yesterday if he was invited to a bash being thrown by President Clinton, the mayor said he was too busy making sure that everyone's limousine arrived securely and on time to bother attending himself.
"And given my political views and everything else, I'm not sure that it would have been the nicest evening," the mayor said, adding, "And you got some people there who have murdered a lot of people." He did not elaborate.
Another New York politician, GOV. GEORGE E. PATAKI, was one of the featured speakers at a fete for businessmen at the Jacob Javits Convention Center on Tuesday given by China's vice premier, QIAN QICHEN.
Governor Pataki told the audience that he planned to go on a trade mission to China this year, noting that China is the state's sixth-largest trading partner, with $2 billion in trade annually. "We intend to seize this opportunity, so economic opportunities between New York State and China grow stronger and stronger," he said.
Asked about China's human rights record, Mr. Pataki responded: "It is important we use these ties to reiterate our respect of the rule of law and respect for human rights. I think stronger ties will lead to greater political freedom." His aides seemed to think facing traffic might be a better bet than any more questions on that score and hustled him away.
 
Singer Settles Malpractice Suit
Lawyers for JULIE ANDREWS announced yesterday that the singer had settled her medical malpractice lawsuit against a Manhattan throat specialist, DR. SCOTT M. KESSLER.
"I am delighted to have settled this case in a favorable manner and am glad to close this chapter on an event which was unfortunate for all concerned," Ms. Andrews, 63, said in a statement.
Her lawyers, ORIN SNYDER and PETER PARCHER, said the settlement reached last month specified that the terms could not be disclosed. Dr. Kessler declined to comment.
The case had been scheduled to go to trial Tuesday before JUDGE LEWIS A. KAPLAN in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The settlement was reached privately, without arbitration.
"She is still having profound difficulties singing as a result of the surgery," Mr. Snyder said.
Ms. Andrews was starring in "Victor/Victoria" on Broadway in 1997 when she underwent surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center to remove noncancerous nodules in her throat. The lawsuit alleged that she was not told that the operation carried risks of permanent hoarseness and other complications that might leave her unable to sing.
At the time, her husband, BLAKE EDWARDS, was widely quoted as saying that her voice had been all but ruined.
Initially, Mount Sinai and DR. JEFFREY D. LIBIN, Dr. Kessler's partner, were named in the suit, but Ms. Andrews later agreed to drop them. NEIL MacFARQUHAR with Julian Barnes

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
GORE OFFERS VISION OF BETTER TIMES FOR MIDDLE CLASS

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Unveiling a book-length plan that hinges on optimistic fiscal forecasts, Vice President Al Gore today offered his economic vision for the future, painting an image of a prosperous middle class that enjoys higher incomes, with more home ownership, more high-tech jobs and more people going to college.
"My cause is hard-working, middle-class families," he declared at the start of his speech here today at Cleveland State University. 
 Mr. Gore outlined a series of social and economic goals that he said were attainable given the nation's current prosperity, and he presented a mountain of supporting detail that his campaign hopes will make Gov. George W. Bush's financial plan pale in comparison.
The speech reflected a shift in language and approach for Mr. Gore, who has in recent days replaced the "working families" he courted so assiduously during the Democratic National Convention last month with "middle-class" families.
"The Gore-Lieberman economic plan," he said, "has one guiding purpose: to help the middle-class families who have always been America's purpose and pride, the people who pay the taxes, bear the burdens and live the American dream."
In his convention speech Mr. Gore used the phrase "working families" nine times. In today's speech, , he used "middle-class" 12 times and "working families" only once.
The release of Mr. Gore's economic blueprint reignited a debate with Mr. Bush over whose plan can best manage the projected budget surplus over the next decade without ruining the economy. News Analysis, Page A26.
Mr. Bush wasted little time yesterday attacking the plan, saying Mr. Gore had made so many spending promises that he would eat through the surplus.
To deflect such perceptions, Mr. Gore included in his glossy, 191-page plan a pledge to set aside $300 billion as a hedge against overly optimistic fiscal projections. Aside from the rainy day fund, Mr. Gore's plan is largely a synthesis of many specific programs he has described over the last several months. But today was the first time the vice president had drawn all of these stray threads together into a broader theme.
Mr. Gore said his 10 goals were to: eliminate the debt by 2012; protect the Social Security and Medicare surpluses; double the number of families that have more than $50,000 in savings; reduce income taxes on the typical family to the lowest level in 50 years; raise family income by a third over the next decade; enable seven in ten families to own their own homes; increase the number of people who go to college; reduce poverty to below 10 percent for the first time since poverty statistics were kept in 1959 (it was 12.7 percent in 1998); cut the gap between wages earned by men and women; and create 10 million new high-tech jobs.
Some aspects of the plan beget others. For example, eliminating the debt by 2012 would reduce interest rates and thus make school loans more affordable so that more people could attend college.
The economic blueprint that Mr. Gore offered today is a road map of middle-class life. It envisions expanded income in continuing boom times, with more people going to college and working in well-paying, high-tech jobs.
Mr. Gore's focus on the middle class is something of a turn away from the more combative populist language he has relied on for weeks. It reflects, in part, the arrival of a new pollster, Stanley Greenberg, who has written extensively about the middle class and helped Bill Clinton capture that broad swath of voters in 1992.
Mr. Gore's advisers said he had deliberately used the phrase "middle class" in this speech because he was also talking about reducing the number of people in poverty and wanted to distinguish between the two.
But the vice president has been using the term "middle class" in speeches for days now, and has been losing "working families." The plan he distributed today was titled "Prosperity for America's Families."
Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who at one time advised Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, on word choice and language, said that Mr. Gore appeared to have moved deliberately away from "working families" to the "middle class" to broaden his reach. Mr. Luntz said that voters perceived "working families" as applying to young couples and excluding people who were retired or about to retire. This is a huge block of voters who are especially important because they tend to go to the polls in larger numbers than younger people.
"The battleground in this election is for the 30-somethings and the near-retirees," Mr. Luntz said.
He said focus groups with voters he has conducted for MSNBC have found that the phrase "working families" was working against Mr. Gore, not only because of its connotations of youth, but also because of its suggestion of class distinctions that Americans are loath to acknowledge.
Mr. Gore's plan, particularly the goal of raising family income by a third over the next decade, assumes an annual growth rate in incomes of 2.9 percent -- a fairly ambitious goal, although the most recent figures available show that from 1997 to 1998, median family income grew 3.3 percent, to $46,737 from $45,262. Mr. Gore's budget advisers acknowledged that the country had never sustained such growth over a 10-year period.
Mr. Gore told his audience to "read my plan," a pointed reference to the infamous pronouncement by former President George Bush, father of Mr. Gore's current rival, who told voters, "Read my lips: no new taxes."
"My plan wasn't built on cross-your-fingers economics that says we can give more to the people who already have the most and then just hope the benefits trickle down to the middle class," Mr. Gore said, again contrasting himself with the Reagan-Bush era.
To demonstrate a fiscally conservative approach, Mr. Gore said his $300 billion rainy-day fund would be a hedge against overly optimistic surplus projections.
"If today's economic forecasts fall short, this new reserve fund will guarantee that we will not have to cut education or health care," Mr. Gore said. "And unlike the promises made on the other side, we won't be running deficits and endangering America's prosperity."
Robert D. Reischauer, President Clinton's former director of the Office of Management and Budget -- now an analyst with the Urban Institute -- said the plan, especially the rainy-day fund, was "fiscally prudent and politically sound."
He said that Mr. Gore's goals would essentially "fall in his lap" if the economy continued its expansion, and that these goals appealed to most voters.
"The vast majority of people view themselves as middle class," he said. "Those who are not in the middle class have aspirations to be there, and they view those aspirations as realistic, so you don't offend anybody."
 
In His Own Words
AL GORE
 
Remarks prepared for delivery yesterday at Cleveland State University about his economic plans.
"I propose to take 1 out of every 6 dollars of the budget surplus, and put it aside. So it will not be used for new spending. It will not be used for new tax cuts. It will not be spent on promises or proposals of any kind.
So if today's economic forecasts fall short, this new reserve fund will guarantee that we will not have to cut education or health care. And unlike the promises made on the other side, we won't be running deficits and endangering America's prosperity.
If you entrust me with the presidency, I will make sure the resources are there to invest in our families and build a more prosperous future. . . .
I'm fighting for a full range of targeted tax cuts for middle-class families. To help you save for college and retirement. To pay for health insurance and child care. To reform the estate tax, so people can pass on a small business or a family farm. And to end the marriage penalty -- the right way, the fair way. . . .
Taken together, these middle-class tax cuts will bring the typical family's tax burden to its lowest level in 50 years.
But let me say it plainly: I will not go along with a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else and wreck our good economy in the process."

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Thursday about Vice President Al Gore's economic plan misstated the title of Robert D. Reischauer, who spoke of it favorably. He is president of the Urban Institute, not an analyst there. In some copies, the article misidentifed the office of which he is the former director. It is the Congressional Budget Office, not the Office of Management and Budget.

HEADLINE: CABARET GUIDE

 BODY:
A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.
 
"BERLIN TO BROADWAY WITH KURT WEILL," Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 279-4200 until Thursday; after that, (212) 239-6200. If this is not a flawless revue, it is nevertheless an ingratiating tribute to his achievement. Fridays, Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Wednesdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; no show this Monday but an added performance Sunday at 4:30 p.m. Tickets: $45 (Lawrence Van Gelder). 

QUEEN ESTHER, Joe's Pub, Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. The artist exudes an impish charm that recalls the sorely missed comedian and performance artist Danitra Vance. But by the end of the show her musical identity remains undefined. Her nondescript versions of "The Lady Is a Tramp" and "Lush Life" fail to illuminate either the material or her ideas. And when she caps her show with two more vintage lounge songs, "I've Gotta Be Me" and "The Good Life," it isn't clear whether she's making fun of them or embracing them. The best moments of "Unemployed Superstar" are the nonmusical monologues in which Queen Esther impersonates embittered neighbors she met when she moved to Harlem. Characters like these could form the basis of an unsettling evening of serious political comedy. Tonight at 8:30. Tickets: $12. Also at Joe's Pub, tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Liza Jessie Peterson, singer, in the funk opera "Chiron's Homegirl Healer Howls" and new work. Tickets: $12. Sunday at 9 p.m., Eszter Balint, singer and songwriter. Tickets: $10 (Stephen Holden).
 
 * "OUR SINATRA," Reprise Room at Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes. He focuses on what he calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, whose creamy baritone echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock concentrates on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves that there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Tonight, Monday and Tuesday nights at 8, tomorrow and Wednesdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m., Sunday nights at 7:30. Tickets: $50 and $55; ringside seating, $75 and $80 (Holden).

That Mystery That No One Wants to Think About Is Getting More Complex

BYLINE: By Julie Salamon 

 BODY:
In America, a nation of strivers, people want to believe that everything is subject to improvement, even dying. But while death remains (presumably) a constant, the act of dying has become more complex. Medical advances have prolonged life, but often in an undesirable form, forcing doctors to reconsider their roles and obligations. Terminally ill patients may think they want to take control of their mortality with physician-assisted suicide, then find they are afraid.
So dying remains a mystery, subject to legal, medical, theological, emotional and economic considerations. No one wants to think about it, but eventually everyone must. To help, Bill Moyers has provided an extraordinary guide with "On Our Own Terms," his panoramic and often profoundly moving vision of how we die in America today. 
 In this four-part, six-hour PBS series, Mr. Moyers and his crew cover a lot of physical as well as emotional ground, featuring doctors and patients from all over the country in all kinds of financial and family circumstances and uncovering heart-wrenching and sometimes surprising stories of fortitude and fragility, indifference and love.
While many of the intimate case studies Mr. Moyers presents offer the intense emotion of great drama, he always aims to instruct. So in addition to the six hours presented on television, PBS has produced elaborate amplification at www.pbs.org, making this program a vivid illustration of how television and the Internet are becoming increasingly linked. Throughout the program, references to corresponding links on the PBS Web site appear on-screen. The Web site offers comprehensive information on both practical and intangible matters, including financial planning for terminally ill patients, various treatment alternatives and "taking a spiritual inventory."
Unlike the new genre of hospital documentaries like ABC's excellent series "Hopkins: 24/7," Mr. Moyers and his producers don't try to mimic the fast-paced style of prime-time television dramas -- though these cameras also follow patients into conferences with their doctors and into their homes. Often the cameras stop to show pictures of the patients before, when they were happy and whole, and these ordinary snapshots take on layers of poignancy and meaning. Viewers meet people who face death with humor as well as resoluteness, like the retired math teacher who refers to each weekly gathering with her children and grandchildren as "the last supper."
Mr. Moyers isn't afraid to linger, to acknowledge the knotted layers of his subject. Introducing the third episode, "A Death of One's Own," which deals with assisted suicide, Mr. Moyers notes that the subject is often sensationalized by the media and pointedly observes that in this program "Dr. Kevorkian is not heard from."
Generally, Mr. Moyers is an unobtrusive but steady presence, introducing each episode and then occasionally appearing on camera to ask a gently leading question. ("Is it hard to have to focus on him all the time?" he asks a dying man's wife.)
The producers have assembled a remarkable array of subjects, people whose obsession with death -- whether personal or professional -- provokes multifarious thoughts about it. They found Thomas Lynch, the Michigan undertaker who is also an author on the subject, a homespun poet and philosopher, and a smart, sensitive doctor specializing in palliative care at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She requires her medical students to read Tolstoy's "Death of Ivan Ilyich," about a man who is dying without anyone's acknowledging that his death is imminent.
The undertaker from Michigan wonders why so many people ask for funerals without flowers, but when Diana, Princess of Wales, died, strangers offered flowers in abundance. A doctor in Charlottesville, Va., tries to convince a group of medical students that to stop giving a patient food and air through tubes isn't killing him, just letting him die. In New York City, a young man's family, refusing to acknowledge that their son is dying, wants to reduce his pain medication so that he can be alert enough to fight the disease that will kill him anyway.
The series falters only in the last episode, "A Time to Change," which becomes preachy as it poses important questions about the financial challenges of providing good end-of-life care to everyone. In part because many of the patients featured here are too far gone to make a connection, some of the immediacy of the earlier episodes is diminished.
The series shines with its individual portraits, some of which have the resonance of good literature. In "A Death of One's Own," Jim Witcher, a veterinarian in Louisiana, and his wife, Susie, are living their lifelong dream of owning a horse farm in retirement -- a dream fulfilled except that he is dying of Lou Gehrig's disease, a creeping paralysis that will steadily destroy every function. He wants to be put to sleep before he dies a miserable death, the way he often relieved the suffering of animals when he was in practice, but assisted suicide is illegal in Louisiana and against his family's religious beliefs.
His wife sympathizes enormously but can't promise him she'll fulfill his wishes. It's too much for her to be both a grieving wife and an ethicist. So she does what she is able, caring for him at home because, she says, clearly loving, she can't bear the thought of a stranger "wiping his bottom." It is wrenching to watch her struggle to hoist her husband from his wheelchair onto a plastic chair for his shower, then bathe him with the same strong hands she uses to soap and rinse their horses.
The first episode, "Living With Dying," begins with Bill Bartholome, a pediatrician in Kansas City, an articulate observer of his own dying. It reveals no secrets to say that Dr. Bartholome dies at the end of the program. That's the point of his presence.
But first, he engages the audience with his matter-of-factness, which transmits deep intelligence and bravery. When he received his diagnosis, it seemed appropriate to him that he should be stricken. "Why not have it be somebody who can deal with it?" he says.
Dr. Bartholome possesses the mixed blessing of being able to diagnose his illness (esophageal cancer) and to monitor its progress. After initially experiencing "a kind of grief I had never known," he says, he determined to live with vibrancy as "a terminal person." He doesn't want to kill himself as he nears death; nor does he want to prolong his life. He just wants to die at home, with his wife present, as comfortably as possible.
For him, this is a personal decision, though Mr. Moyers demonstrates that Dr. Bartholome is part of a wider movement to humanize the dying process. Hospitals like Mount Sinai have established palliative care units whose focus is not on curing patients but on easing their pain, though patients still may request medical treatment beyond painkillers. Then there are hospices, where the emphasis is strictly on comfort, not cure.
Mr. Moyers meets with Dr. Bartholome and his wife over a period of months, and the patient is visibly losing ground, dropping 20 pounds in less than a month. By the end this tall man weighs 154 pounds, a shadow of the hearty 216-pound fellow seen in a snapshot happily holding a freshly caught fish.
He writes a journal about his experience and confesses in one interview that he is in pain, but decided not to take his medication that day so he could think clearly. "I want to be master of ceremonies at this thing," he says of his death. Perhaps we dare not ask for anything more.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Sisters, for a Time, in Revolution

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
GIVE credit to Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim's director. He remains a genius hustler. For the opening yesterday of "Amazons of the Avant-Garde," the exhibition of paintings by six Russian women from around the time of the Revolution, Mr. Krens invited President Vladimir Putin of Russia to stop by.
Mr. Krens's latest multinational enterprise links the Guggenheim and the cash-challenged Hermitage in St. Petersburg. This is a big deal potentially. The two museums plan jointly to franchise themselves (the Hermitage, like the Guggenheim, has already been multiplying, with an outpost in London and one coming in Amsterdam), and to swap pictures and exhibitions. A permanent, tourist-ensuring Hermitage section would be installed at the proposed Guggenheim near the Financial District. (Are you listening, City Hall?) There would even be more non modern art shows uptown. 
 You can bet that all such historical forays, should they materialize, will further infuriate the Metropolitan and other colleagues on whose territory Mr. Krens blithely poaches. He doesn't care, obviously. It's a new world he is designing for museums. Survival of the fittest. Perfect for Wall Street.
And why complain? Cultural economics works in funny ways these days, but the system incidentally benefits the public, sometimes.
Witness "Amazons," a concise exercise, organized by Matthew Drutt, a Guggenheim curator, with Zelfira Tregulova and John Bowlt. Monographically arranged, it tendentiously focuses just on the years before and after the Revolution and on painting; several of the artists continued to work much later and did more than paint. The women (Aleksandra Exter, Natalia Goncharova, Liubov Popova, Olga Rozanova, Varvara Stepanova and Nadezhda Udaltsova) are familiar, thanks to a slew of Russian shows. Only a couple of them, Goncharova and Popova, are great painters; the others are not, but the exhibition isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. In one way or another, each nudged Russian culture, briefly anyway, into the 20th century, a testament to the impact of women on modern art before the word feminism came around.
Except for Stepanova, they weren't especially political, at least not before the Revolution, meaning that they wanted artistic change, which was not the same as being Bolsheviks who wanted to knock off the czar. Mostly they were well-off. (Stepanova was the exception again.) They traveled around Europe, absorbed new French and Italian art and moved in connected circles, but often competitively.
They didn't paint alike, so they certainly weren't a unified group. Goncharova mixed Russian folk art, Chinese and Byzantine art with German, French and Italian modernism to make neo-primitive, Cubo-Futurist, mystical masterpieces. As that list implies, her section of the show is a mad dash through different styles.
Stepanova gravitated from Cubo-Futurist illustrated poems to images of dancing robots based on some sort of mathematical calculations she made. Udaltsova was a Cubist turned Suprematist. Exter was a colorist -- like her friends in Paris the artists Robert and Sonia Delaunay -- who was influenced not only by Cubism but also by Ukrainian embroidery. Popova, next to Goncharova, was the finest painter. She began with Cubism, then absorbed one idea after another before she, like several of these other women, decided in the revolutionary spirit that easel painting had had its day, and switched to utilitarian, proletariat-friendly textile and stage-set designing.
The show doesn't pursue the story that far. Popova and Rozanova both died young. Goncharova left Moscow for Paris to design for Diaghilev and stayed. Exter moved to Paris in 1924 and taught at Leger's studio. Stepanova's career fizzled under the Soviet regime, as did the career of Udaltsova, branded a formalist by Stalin. She died in 1961.
Linda Nochlin, the art historian, recently joked that before it all came apart, this was at least "one avant-garde that featured women working rather than just taking off their clothes and lying down." True enough. They operated alongside their male counterparts without anybody seeming to consider it remarkable. If any of the women felt strongly about their role vis-a-vis the men, they kept their opinions to themselves. That wasn't their concern. Russia having had a tradition of female patrons, gallery owners and artists, they tapped into it naturally. On this issue the rest of Russian society was stuck in the middle ages, but the avant-garde provided a cocoon of comparative enlightenment and equal opportunity. The story in the exhibition seems if anything more, not less, remarkable, for having as little to do with gender as it does, and almost everything to do with painting.
And that is what unites these women, despite the differences: they were all modern painters at a moment of incredible upheaval.
If it were possible to have met any one of them, it would probably be Goncharova, the Damien Hirst of prerevolutionary Moscow, who issued crazy decrees, appeared in outrageous films and cabarets and scandalized the public with pictures that the police repeatedly confiscated as pornographic and blasphemous. She became a sensation and great success, her inspiration having been the Futurists. She aspired not just to Futurism's aesthetic but also to its mastery of hype, its worship of change for its own sake. At the same time her art came from a mind saturated in fantasies of homeland, mystical religion, primitive art, peasant society and the peculiarities of the human body.
"Peasants Gathering Grapes" typifies at least two of her fixations, ancient stone idols and native Russian subjects, which she combines into a purely modern image whose god (Futurism's god, too) was the machine.
The other women achieved Goncharova's imaginative level sporadically. Rozanova ended up painting a couple of amazing abstractions, one of them a single quivering green stripe against bare white, Barnett Newman before the fact.
Udaltsova, who studied in Paris under Jean Metzinger and Henri Le Fauconnier, made solid, unremarkable Cubist pictures with exceptions like "At the Piano": its fragmented forms, in syncopated rhythm, imply movement ingeniously. Stepanova's illustrated poems and dancing figures are crudely painted, which becomes a virtue in one striking self-portrait in which she grimaces, a tick-tack-toe board and black dots for her eyes, eyebrows and nose.
Popova's legacy is obscured without the textiles, typography and stage designs, although the paintings, even this show's uneven selection of them, give an idea of her gifts. As with Udaltsova, she studied in Paris under Metzinger and Le Fauconnier, and she must have scrutinized Leger from the beginning, because "Composition With Figures," its mechanical figures locked in a shimmer of gold-blue faceting, is very close to his style. But it is far from secondhand because of Popova's extraordinary way of building space and her exquisite touch.
She was said to have been inspired by Italian Renaissance art, too, and this composition, the figures in a landscape, is so basic that it goes back at least to Giorgione, typifying, perhaps, the ambition of the Russian avant-gardists to evoke the old Renaissance to bring about a new one.
"The world has been transformed into a single, monstrous, fantastic, perpetually moving machine," wrote the poet Aleksander Shevchenko in 1913. "We, like some kind of ideally manufactured mechanical man, have grown used to living, getting up, going to bed, eating and working by the clock -- and the sense of rhythm and mechanical harmony, reflected in the whole of our life, cannot help but be reflected in our thinking and in our spiritual life: in Art."
It sounded good at the time, the promise of mechanization and modernity. In the paintings of these women it clearly flourished, unspoiled, before Stalin flipped Shevchenko's vision on its head, making mechanized society a dystopia.
The works in "Amazons" have a surprising fortitude even now. Revolution. A brave new art world. The idea persists although the form it takes continually changes. Ask Mr. Krens.
 "Amazons of the Avant-Garde" is at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Jan. 7.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Nasdaq Index Climbs 2.1%, but Blue-Chip Shares Fall

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
High-tech stocks rebounded yesterday after a two-day downturn, while blue chips fell following another spate of corporate earnings warnings.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 85.01 points, or 2.1 percent, to 4,098.35, buoyed by the same stocks that investors could not wait to get rid of earlier this week. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 50.77 points, or 0.5 percent, to 11,259.87, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 10.26 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,502.51.
"This is a continuation of the rotation the market has become accustomed to," said Bob Streed, senior vice president at Northern Trust in Chicago. "The money seems to flow back and forth. Yesterday, investors took their money out of technology and put it into blue chips. Today, they're taking it out of blue chips and putting it back into technology."
Technology stocks had their best day so far in a trading week abbreviated by the Labor Day holiday. The chip maker Intel was up $1.74, to $67.44, after tumbling for two days on an influential analyst's downgrade.
Micron Technology, another chip maker that was downgraded by an analyst on Wednesday, was up $4.75, to $73.50.
And Sun Microsystems rose $6.31, to $123.94, gaining back nearly all of its loss from Wednesday, when investors bid the stock down from $124.75 to less than $118.
Investor enthusiasm did not extend to blue chips, however, where a mix of profit taking and corporate warnings contributed to investor flight. Shares of DuPont fell $4.88, to $42.13, after the chemical company said earnings would be below expectations because of decreased demand and higher costs.
"DuPont essentially said today it is going to have the same kind of earnings as it did four years ago," said Mike Weiner, a managing director at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. "Because DuPont is down, a lot of other companies are, too."
Campbell Soup, Circuit City Stores and May Department Stores also warned yesterday that their quarterly earnings would be flat or below expectations. Circuit City fell 81 cents, to $26.94, and May was down $1.31 at $22.38. Shares of Campbell were up 25 cents at $25.13.
Shares of Restoration Hardware dropped nearly 20 percent, falling $1.19, to $4.81, after the home furnishings retailer said it was in need of additional financing and had hired an investment bank to help it find a new source of capital.
Analysts have been warning investors to expect flat or lower earnings because of the slowdown in economic growth. The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times since last summer, and recent data suggests the economy is indeed slowing.
Also yesterday, MP3 continued to decline, falling $1.69 -- or more than 21 percent -- to $6.19. A federal judge ruled Wednesday that MP3.com, which allows people to listen to songs over the Internet but not download them to their computers, violated Universal's copyrights.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasury Prices Decline
 (By Reuters) -- Treasury bond prices fell yesterday as increasing oil prices and growing corporate debt sales put the market in a sour mood.
An outright purchase of shorter-dated Treasury securities early in the session by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York helped push shorter paper higher.
But concerns over corporate supply, rising oil prices and the European common currency's tumble sank in shortly afterward.
"We had the world's biggest buyer here come into the market this morning -- the Fed. That lifted people out of some positions. And then we went back to anticipating a monster corporate calendar," said Chris Rupkey, senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
"There might have been some hedged selling ahead of the corporate supply where people took advantage of the higher prices," he said.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 7/32, to a price of 100 1/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.75 percent from 5.72 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4/32, to 107 21/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.71 percent from 5.70 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Odd Couple of German Politics: Left-Right Alliance

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Sept. 7

 BODY:
They are the unlikeliest of allies a former West German Army officer trained in the United States and a longtime member of the East German Communist Party who spent much of his life teaching Marxist theory.
But Udo Voigt, who still sports a military mustache, and Michael Nier, who still quotes Lenin, have found common cause in the rightist National Democratic Party, creating the heady platform of nostalgic nationalism and "German Socialism" that the movement now proposes. 
 Since neo-Nazi violence, much of it directed against foreigners, became the chief object of debate here after a bombing on July 27 in Dusseldorf, the government has discussed at length a possible ban on the party, whose youth wing is widely seen as providing a meeting point for rightist thugs.
But little of the talk has focused on the diffuse makeup of a party that has tried to broaden its support by grafting East German grievances onto its West German tradition of revisionist nationalism. In their different frustrations, Mr. Voigt and Mr. Nier suggest the diversity of German anger and the potential difficulty of quelling it.
They also display how the extreme right in Germany, as elsewhere in Europe, awkwardly mixes traditional conservative values like nationalism with traditional left-wing values like the defense of workers in an effort to build a new power base.
The migration of center-left parties toward the embrace of the market has opened new opportunities for such parties with the less well-off, as Jorg Haider's Freedom Party has illustrated in Austria.
For now, the odd alliance -- Mr. Voigt is the party leader and Mr. Nier is its chief theorist -- seems to have had some limited success. The party has doubled its membership, to 6,600 members in the last three years, with many new members younger than 30 and coming from Mr. Nier's state, Saxony.
Thousands of inquiries about membership have poured in since the discussion of a ban began, and the party's new aim is to attract 20,000 members. "Then we could have real influence," Mr. Voigt said.
Portraying himself as the defender of the "ordinary German under siege by foreigners," Mr. Voigt, 48, traced his convictions from the time when his father, Richard, slapped him in a dispute over the Nazis.
"I was about 12 and I had been shown films of Auschwitz at school, so I believed that anyone who fought with Hitler was evil," he said. "I came home and confronted my father. I told him he was a criminal.."
Richard Voigt had served as a Wehrmacht soldier in a tank division, first on the French front and then in Russia. He told his son that he had known nothing of Auschwitz or other camps until after the war.
He told his son that ordinary Germans like himself were not criminals. He recalled, in defense of the army, how he had witnessed the execution of a German soldier condemned by a military court for the rape of a Polish girl.
So began Udo Voigt's transformation into a nationalist, convinced that his father's generation had been unfairly sullied, that the Holocaust had become an industry intended to impose permanent shame on Germany and that other genocides, including "killing the native Indians in America," had been forgotten.
"When the Jews speak of collective German guilt for the Third Reich, we get angry," he said. "Their aim is an extension of the Morgenthau plan for the dismemberment of Germany, an attempt to paralyze us by passing guilt from generation to generation."
In World War II, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. proposed turning Germany into a politically meaningless state by destroying industry and allowing only an agrarian economy. His ideas were rejected.
"The generation that was responsible for Hitler's crimes has had to pay for them, and the criminals were judged," said Mr. Voigt, who spent 12 years in the West German Army, rising to captain. "We have handed out more than $100 billion in reparations. I was born in 1952, and my generation had no responsibility. Those who are young today have even less. But the imposition of guilt continues."
Mr. Voigt said the constant "intimidation" of Germany is intended to ensure that no new national sentiment is possible. It is also meant to create a guilt complex feeding a sense of obligation in Germany that leads it to take in more and more foreigners to prove its tolerance.
But foreigners, to Mr. Voigt, are Germany's chief problem. In his time in the United States in 1973 and 1974, training on missile systems in El Paso, he saw what he called severe racial problems in the United States Army. There lay one seed of his opposition to a "multiethnic and multicultural state."
He said that if his party gained power -- an extremely remote possibility, given that it has about 1 percent of the vote -- any foreigner without work for three months would immediately be sent back to his home country. Foreigners would not be allowed to own real estate and would be excluded from welfare, "because that is one of the main reasons they come to this country."
"We would have a five-year plan to send foreigners back," he said. "A large number will go. Not in 24 hours. But I believe that in the end 80 to 90 percent would leave."
There are more than seven million foreigners in Germany, 9 percent of the population.
Mr. Voigt deplored recent anti-immigrant violence and said his party had nothing to do with it. But, he said, high unemployment and high immigration were bringing Germany to a breaking point.
"Our course of action now is to represent the frustrated German worker," he continued. "The Social Democrats have deserted the worker for foreign capitalist interests. Yet poverty is growing. Ours will be a new German Socialism."
Enter Mr. Nier, born into the Third Reich in Dresden in 1943, the son of a convinced Nazi, a member of a family traumatized by the Allied bombardment of Dresden that forced them to flee, a child of the postwar East German Communist state.
His is a different frustration, far from that of a Rhineland military man who feels Germany has been on the receiving end of American- or Jewish-led claims and criticism for too long. Mr. Nier's is the frustration of a man who feels he lost his Communist home. Both frustrations are potent and, in some degree, widespread, if seldom expressed publicly.
Mr. Nier joined the Communist Party in 1965, worked in an automobile factory and moved on to study philosophy in Dresden. "Then," he said, "I started teaching at the Technical University in Chemnitz and other technical institutes, before the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, and I lost my job like just about everyone else."
Holding a succession of jobs -- he describes the latest as "teaching history to 15 women who have no reason to learn history" -- Mr. Nier remained in his party until two years ago. Then he abruptly switched to the extreme right and the National Democratic Party.
"Look, Voigt is a former officer and I'm a former Communist, but we have one shared perception," he said. "That is, that the Social Democrats and Christian Democrats have abandoned ordinary people. The only party for the simple people today is ours. That is why I developed the slogan, 'Socialism in Germany.' "
Mr. Nier insisted that the party should have nothing to do with the terror of the Third Reich and said a pivotal battle was engaged between "the destructive Nazi side of the party, which is stronger for now, and my battle for a progressive people-based national movement."
He added that German pride would have to be restored by "building back the European Union to acceptable levels," making clear to immigrants that "this is our land, clear and simple" and preventing German soldiers' serving as "pawns" of Americans in places like Kosovo.
That message would eventually prevail, Mr. Nier insisted, adding that he would welcome a party ban, because it "would be seen as antidemocratic and give us a huge boost." He smiled confidently and said, "Even Lenin had small beginnings."

HEADLINE: Fuel Shortages Grow as Truckers' Strike Spreads in France

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 7

 BODY:
A strike begun three days ago by truckers who blockaded fuel depots to protest spiraling fuel costs spread today as workers from other sectors of the economy joined the demonstrations, disrupting transportation systems throughout the country.
Farmers, airline workers, bus drivers, taxi drivers and even the owners of river barges and sightseeing boats that cruise the Seine have now joined in the protest. Their actions, along with the truckers' blockade, have combined to produce the growing fuel shortages and varying degrees of inconvenience for consumers. 
 In Bordeaux, for instance, farmers set fire to piles of tires on train tracks, leading to havoc with train schedules in the area. In the north, they blocked border posts between France and Belgium. In other towns, private ambulance drivers used their vehicles to block streets.
Paris had largely been spared in the last few days. But today hundreds of taxis poured into the city in a slow-moving column that created a traffic jam that lasted hours.
In addition, the truckers' blockade of the country's fuel depots has begun to be felt the pumps. France's three major oil companies said that up to 80 percent of their stations were reporting shortages. Some drivers also found it difficult to get fuel because police officers were patrolling gas stations to make sure that police, hospital and emergency service vehicles got the first chance to buy the gas that was available. In other towns, officials sought only to limit hoarding by putting a cap on the amount of fuel that could be purchased.
The strike has quickly become a huge political problem for Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who on Wednesday broke off negotiations with the truckers after two of the country's three major unions refused to ratify an offer of a 15-cent reduction per liter in fuel taxes.
Today, Mr. Jospin did not comment on the strike. But his transportation minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, talked tough, saying, "If we let things go on, that could break the process of growth and development that's going on in our country."
The protest began gathering steam on Sunday after a week in which the government offered a series of financial measures to fishermen, who had also blockaded the country's ports in August because of rising fuel prices.
Many of the truckers believed that they would get relief in a long awaited package of tax cuts that Mr. Jospin's government unveiled last week. But the government instead chose to use a budget surplus from a booming economy in other ways. The plan included only a cut in the taxes on home heating oil.
The cost of fuel has been rising even faster in Europe than in the United States because of the decline in the value of the Euro. On top of that, fuel carries a government surcharge of more than 70 percent in France.
The cost of diesel fuel in France has risen about 40 percent in the last year. A gallon of diesel fuel costs about $2.84 here.
Part of Mr. Jospin's problem in negotiating with the truckers is that even his latest offer has been sharply criticized by environmentalists in his governing coalition. The Greens say his concessions break earlier promises to continue to push France toward using rail traffic over more polluting trucks.
In addition to blocking various border posts, farmers scuffled with the authorities at the Channel Tunnel as they tried to block freight trucks from boarding trains to Britain.
In Brussels, the European Union asked France to prove that it was taking measures to ensure the free movement of goods and access to its ports.
The truckers' blockades, set up at some 80 depots throughout the country, were beginning to take a heavy toll in some areas. One French newspaper reported that school cafeterias in the Vosges region, in eastern France, faced shortages because food suppliers ran out of gas for their delivery trucks. And some school bus routes were shut down in the central city of Lyon.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The Secret Oil Talks

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN; Gail Collins is on vacation.

 BODY:
The heads of state from the OPEC oil countries will gather in Venezuela Sept. 26 to 28 for only their second top-level meeting since OPEC was founded in 1960. The meeting comes as oil prices hit a 10-year high this week at $34 a barrel. Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, the host of the summit, just broke the ring of isolation around Iraq and personally flew to Baghdad to consult Saddam Hussein. Here's what I imagine was their conversation.
Saddam: Hurricane Hugo, how are you? I love the way you snub the Americans. You remind me so much of Fidel. I'm sorry I can't attend your OPEC summit, but the minute I get on a plane, the Americans will either shoot it down or force it down. Just promise me you won't let the Saudis talk everyone there into keeping prices low. The Saudis keep repeating this mantra to OPEC: "The stone age didn't end because they ran out of stones. People invented alternative tools. And the oil age won't end because of a shortage of oil, but because we drive the price up so far, so fast, we stimulate alternatives." But the fact is, the price of oil today, in real terms, is a fraction of what it used to be in 1973. That's why Americans all drive S.U.V.'s. Why should we subsidize their gas guzzling? 
 Chavez: Brother Saddam, I couldn't agree more. Let's face it, I need the money now. Iran needs the money now. You need the money now. We all have soaring populations, we've all, frankly, destroyed the entrepreneurial middle class in our countries, and none of us want to go through the restructuring, deregulation or privatization required for globalization, because it would mean ceding power. So pushing up oil prices is our only means of economic survival. Bush and Gore say, how dare we raise prices? Oh, give me a break. I think we should propose this at our summit: We'll stop acting like a cartel if Microsoft stops acting like a monopoly. We'll cut the price of oil to its real production cost when Microsoft cuts the price of Windows 2000 to its real production cost. How's that?
Saddam: I love it! And the Americans are just playing into our hands. You'd think I was their energy secretary. They're totally unprepared for winter: U.S. heating oil inventories are down nearly 40 percent from a year ago, and crude inventories are at a 24-year low! Heating oil prices have jumped to a 10-year high because of panic that U.S. refiners won't be able to produce enough fuel to heat homes by winter. I read one story where U.S. experts were quoting something called The Farmers' Almanac as predicting it was going to be a mild winter, so they don't have to worry about us. Can you imagine? Betting your whole economy on some almanac written by farmers?
Chavez: They're cocky. They think everything runs on silicon now -- it's all this new-economy stuff. The fact is, we're still the biggest threat to their prosperity and new economy. Without oil, baby, there ain't no bits and there ain't no bytes. We're the real dot in dot-com.
They're just depending on the Saudis to increase production. The fools don't understand the Saudis' real situation. The Saudis are $140 billion in debt, with a huge public payroll and an electricity grid so in need of upgrading they had blackouts this summer. They need cash too. Show me the money, baby! Moreover, the excess capacity the Saudis have is largely in heavy oil, not in the sweet crude the market wants. If Iran, Iraq and Venezuela cut production just a bit we could soak up any Saudi increase.
Saddam: Maybe it's time for a little October surprise. I've waited nine years to get revenge on George Bush. Now I'll get it on his son. Can you imagine if we make oil prices an issue in this U.S. election, with Bush Jr. and Cheney -- the embodiments of Big Oil -- running for office? Gore and Liebowitz, or whatever that Jewish guy's name is, will eat them alive.
Chavez: If either of these candidates was a real leader he would be telling Americans that they actually need to push energy conservation immediately, by raising gas taxes and aggressively reducing their dependence on us. Look who their dot-com economy depends on today -- Iran, Iraq, Venezuela, Russia and Nigeria. Hah! The rogues' gallery! No serious U.S. presidential contender would tolerate that.
Saddam: Then we're safe -- $40 here we come!

HEADLINE: U.S.-China Trade Bill Inches Closer to Passage in the Senate

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
The Senate took an important step closer today to a final vote on President Clinton's major trade bill with China, as momentum built for final passage next week after months of delay.
In a victory for the White House and the business community, senators voted, 92 to 5, to end preliminary debate and proceed to final consideration of a measure that would establish permanent trade relations with China and end Congress's annual review of Beijing's trade status. 
 The Senate then rejected the first of several amendments that threatened to undercut the bill. An amendment by Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, calling on China to increase religious freedom was defeated, 69 to 28.
"The Clinton administration is focused on trade, which it is now promoting as its human rights policy," Mr. Wellstone said. "But trade alone will never guarantee change."
A Republican, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and one of most conservative senators, joined Mr. Wellstone, one of the chamber's leading liberals, in support of the amendment.
"We in America still stand for something -- something other than profit," Mr. Helms said. "We don't believe China should be welcomed into international organizations such as the World Trade Organization while China continues to repress and to jail and to murder and to torture their own citizens."
Another amendment, this one by Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, to support the export of nonpolluting energy technology to China, lost by 65 to 31.
A third measure, by Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, to continue Congress's annual review of China's trade status, was defeated, 81 to 13.
The House approved the contentious trade bill in May, 237 to 197, and more than 70 senators are likely to support the measure in the final vote.
The only mystery left is whether senators will vote to link passage of the trade measure to concerns over China's record on human rights, religious freedom and the environment.
In any other context, many of the amendments would have broad support. But if the Senate adopts any amendments, the bill would have to be returned to the House, where supporters say there is not enough time to reconcile differences before the November elections.
Passage of the legislation is a necessary step for American companies to benefit fully from a deal reached last year by the United States and China that paves China's way into the World Trade Organization, the 135-member trade group that sets the rules for global commerce.
Regardless of how lawmakers vote, China will enter the W.T.O. But without the blessing bestowed by Congress, Beijing could withhold some trade benefits from the United States that it extends to other members of the group.
The biggest obstacle to passing a clean bill is a possible amendment by Senators Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, and Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey.
It would require the administration to monitor China's record on the spread of nuclear, chemical, biological and missile technology, and would impose sanctions if there was evidence of certain types of prohibited weaponry.
President Clinton's top aides oppose the measure, arguing that the legislation would hamper the administration's efforts to combat proliferation.
Support for it as an amendment to the trade bill appeared to be eroding today. Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, who backs the idea, met with supporters and opponents today to try to arrange a separate vote on it.
Spokesmen for Mr. Torricelli and another sponsor of the original legislation, Senator Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho, said the senators had strong reservations about supporting it as an amendment to the trade bill.
Opponents of the Thompson measure expressed optimism they had enough support to defeat it..
"I'm hopeful that we've got the votes, and I'm reasonably optimistic that we do," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader. "But in any election or any vote, only the paranoid survive, and I think we've got to be sufficiently paranoid."
The Senate will debate other potentially crippling amendments through next week.

HEADLINE: The Economic Scoreboard

 BODY:
Ronald Reagan turned "tax and spend" into a near-fatal label for traditional Democrats. One of President Clinton's big achievements has been to rebuild his party's reputation for budgetary restraint and fiscal discipline. Vice President Al Gore, with his carefully crafted economic plan, has been careful to preserve the political capital inherited from Mr. Clinton's success in reducing the federal debt. To be sure, the hefty document Mr. Gore released on Tuesday is as much a campaign manifesto as it is an economic blueprint. Indeed, by combining his previously proposed spending and tax-cutting ideas in one package, he directed attention to the stark differences between his policies and those of Gov. George W. Bush. What emerges is an economic program that is cautious almost to a fault, yet determinedly progressive in its general thrust. Mr. Gore has, properly, focused spending on families most in need.
On the tactical level, Mr. Gore was smart to provide specifics, nearly 200 pages of them. Mr. Bush has so far refused to lay out his plans with equal precision, and his campaign advertisement saying that nearly 300 prominent economists endorse his general approach is not, in campaign terms, a totally satisfactory substitute for specific details. 
 Mr. Gore sets down 10 goals, including cutting poverty to an all-time low, eliminating federal debt by 2012, doubling the number of families with substantial savings, raising home ownership from its current 67 percent to 70 percent of the population by 2004 and college attendance rates from 66 percent to 75 percent by 2010. These goals are only loosely tied to the plan's specific provisions. The important directions are set by the big-ticket items.
Over the next 10 years, the surplus is expected to exceed $4.5 trillion. Mr. Gore proposes to use about $3 trillion to reduce federal debt. By contrast, Mr. Bush's plan would reduce the debt by at most $1 trillion. Traditional Democratic liberals would much rather put this money into social programs, and we share a concern for the nation's unmet needs in health, housing and education. But debt reduction is clearly popular with centrist voters, who see it as a component of today's prosperity. Mr. Gore would be foolish to give away the Democrats' hard-won advantage on the issue of fiscal trustworthiness.
The vice president would devote about $500 billion to "targeted" tax cuts, including a poorly designed tuition tax credit that will do more to enrich colleges than low-income families. But he also includes a $200 billion tax cut for retirement savings that heavily favors low-income families. He proposes to increase tax credits for low-paid workers and to provide a refundable tax credit to offset child care expenses. Mr. Bush would devote about four times as much to tax cuts, reducing revenues by almost $2 trillion. About 40 percent of that would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of families.
Mr. Gore's spending proposals are also designed to help low- and moderate-income families. He wants to spend $340 billion on prescription drugs for Medicare enrollees, with the largest subsidies going to poor families. He proposes to spend $50 billion on preschool programs for needy families and about $100 billion on health coverage for uninsured children. The design of these programs largely avoids election-year handouts to well-off voters.
Mr. Bush has criticized Mr. Gore for outspending the projected surplus. True, Mr. Gore's proposals to subsidize drugs and retirement savings are likely to cost far more than he concedes. But the better way for Mr. Bush to press the economic policy debate is to publish an equally detailed plan instead of asking the public to depend on reassurances from economists in his own ideological camp.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN NEW YORK: GLOBALIZATION;
China's New Culture Starting To Take Shape, Minister Says

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
For Sun Jiazheng, the Chinese culture minister, the emergence of a global culture wears many faces. On the one hand, moviegoers in Beijing can swoon at screenings of "Titanic." On the other, computer jockeys in Shanghai might surf Web sites that carry "unhealthy" material.
"I would say that to a considerable extent, China has opened up its cultural market," Mr. Sun said in a speech on Wednesday night at the Museum of Television and Radio in Midtown Manhattan. "However, China's market economic system is newly established, and its cultural industry with a market mechanism has just started to take shape. Therefore, we face both opportunities and real tough challenges." 
 Mr. Sun, in an interview after the speech, trumpeted foreign investment opportunities in China's electronic media, but emphasized that certain sectors, particularly the Internet industry, would have to open up "gradually" and with continued government monitoring of content.
As part of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations summit meeting, Mr. Sun was giving his talk in celebration of an agreement that permits the museum to acquire programming from the Chinese government's audiovisual archives. He was introduced to the audience by Henry A. Kissinger, former secretary of state.
At its heart, Mr. Sun's speech heralded China's impending entry into the World Trade Organization and called for foreign investment in the country's media infrastructure, from opening theater chains to distributing videotapes and music recordings. One example of openness, he said, is that China will soon import 20 American movies a year instead of 10.
At the same time, foreign cultural materials would be allowed into the country only "as long as they abide by Chinese laws and regulations, and cater to the tastes of the Chinese people," Mr. Sun said.
The last decade has seen a gradual emergence of civil society in China, with an attendant rise in forms of cultural expression not sponsored by the state. Punk bands perform at nightclubs, guerrilla filmmaking is not uncommon, and experimental painters have toured their exhibitions abroad. Yet, the government continues to try to exercise control over the media, occasionally shutting down journals and asking prize-winning directors to cut their movies.
The booming new media industry is an especially sensitive area, given the growing number of Internet users -- more than 17 million -- and the anarchic nature of the medium. Mr. Sun said that the government was working on a policy that would encourage growth, but that officials had not settled on details. Americans have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into start-up enterprises, even though government rules sometimes keep the Internet companies mired in paperwork.
"Personally, I believe that the development of the Internet is definitely, absolutely a good thing," Mr. Sun said. But "the content contained in the Internet is mixed," he said. "The Chinese government has called attention to this development, the fact that there exists some unhealthy content on the Internet."
Except for pointing to pornography, Mr. Sun did not specify what might be deemed unhealthy. The government continues to block access to certain Web sites, including those of several foreign news outlets, even though many savvy computer users can get around the firewalls. This summer, the government announced that local officials would start Internet surveillance units and track down people who post political dissents. The authorities have made several arrests in the last few months for such offenses.

HEADLINE: Rickety Japanese Banks;
As Borrowers Collapse, Is New Bailout Needed?

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
First, there was the failure of the Sogo Company, a lumbering department store chain that was crushed earlier in the summer by its $17 billion in debt.
Then, a construction contractor, Inoue Kogyo, was rescued from a similar fate when its banks forgave $136 million in debt; Hazama, another construction company, may receive similar treatment for about $1 billion worth. 
 Most recently, the central bank moved to raise interest rates, if only fractionally.
Any one of those events increased the strain on Japan's rickety banking system. The question now is whether their combined effect will be toxic, forcing the government to intervene as it did two years ago when the financial system came close to collapsing.
So far, 25 trillion yen in tax money has been spent, or $238 billion at current exchange rates, on a government overhaul of the financial system, out of $666 billion allocated for that purpose in 1998. Even more has been spent to prop up banks and other financial institutions indirectly, through credit-guarantee programs and the like.
"We are standing at the same divide where we were standing two years ago, when we recapitalized the banks," said Yasuhisa Shiozaki, a youngish legislator from the governing Liberal Democratic Party, who has been a rather lonely advocate of painful financial restructuring. "We can either recapitalize the banks again, or we can just let them go bust."
Mr. Shiozaki is perhaps the boldest of a growing group of politicians, economists and government officials who think that Japan never entirely repaired its banking system after many banks stumbled into crisis in autumn 1997, falling victim to profligate lending policies and social pressure to maintain relationships, whatever the cost.
Senior officials at the watchdog Financial Supervisory Agency have been telling reporters and analysts that three or four more big banks should have been nationalized in 1998, along with the ones that were -- the Long-Term Credit Bank and the Nippon Credit Bank. But politicians, they say, would not sanction such radical surgery.
Mr. Shiozaki doubts that the government has the will for a second round of refinancing in the wake of Sogo's collapse, when a plan to spend close to $1 billion to waive debt and keep the company afloat was swamped in an outcry of public disapproval.
Ruling-party politicians quickly scrapped the plan, and Sogo failed, blowing away the fig leaf that covered Japan's supposedly resolved bad-debt problems. "What we found out with Sogo and afterward is that the essential and fundamental problems of the Japanese economy were still there or perhaps even worse," Mr. Shiozaki said.
Although a second injection of public money into the banking system may be unlikely, the government has proved itself adroit at devising bank rescue programs in disguise.
A decision to postpone a deposit-insurance program that would limit government protection to about $95,000 a depositor, rather than the unlimited protection in place since 1996, was aimed at protecting the regional banks and local lenders that might easily see their customers flee for bigger, sounder institutions if the plan were to start in March 2001 as originally intended.
And the government's $285 billion credit-guarantee program for small and midsize enterprises is as much about supporting banks as about helping struggling mom-and-pop businesses.
Takatomo Nakagawa, a researcher at Teikoku Data Bank, remarked: "The companies using this program were, in many cases, using the money especially to pay back existing bank loans, not only for the operations of the company. The money was used for the banks."
As of March, the major banks had more than $40 billion reserved against bad debts, but James P. Fiorillo, senior banking analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo, estimates that those reserves would cover only about 2.5 percent of their potential problem loans. He says he doubts that all bad debt has been properly classified and that real estate collateral has been properly valued.
Officials are more optimistic. Statistics show that the big banks have enough reserves to cover 25 percent of the roughly $188 billion in bad debts held at the end of March.
In the fall of 1998, the government enacted sweeping financial overhaul legislation aimed at setting the banking system -- which had nearly collapsed within the preceding year -- back on its feet.
In exchange for an infusion of public money totaling eight trillion yen, or $76 billion, the banks were forced into a wholesale re-evaluation of their loan portfolios, urged to consolidate and exhorted to focus on profitability rather than the relationships that determined past business decisions.
The government spent an additional 6.8 trillion yen, or $64.7 billion, rehabilitating the nationalized Nippon Credit Bank and Long-Term Credit Bank. "I think people forget how much has been accomplished in less than two years," said Yoshimasa Hayashi, a young member of the upper house of Parliament. "The commitment to financial reform continues to be strong."
While an impressive wave of consolidation in the last two years has reduced the number of Japan's biggest banks by half, to 10 from 20 two years ago, it has yet to produce obvious efficiencies. Nor has consolidation noticeably changed the type of business that banks in this country do or the way they do it.
The banks have yet to incur the costs of bringing their technology up to date; in the meantime, nimbler new financial institutions that have linked their fortunes to the Internet are plowing new ground.
To make matters worse, the banks' basic lending business remains in a prolonged slump. Borrowers are either desperately trying to reduce their debts or increasingly relying on the capital markets for their borrowing needs.
And the banks are struggling with negative forces over which they, and the government, have little or no control. Credit-rating agencies warn that bankruptcies, ratcheting up every month, are likely to reach a high this year as bigger and bigger debtors collapse. Bankruptcies rose 21 percent in July compared with July 1999, according to Teikoku Databank, and the total debt owed by companies that collapsed tripled, to $2.4 billion.
"If we see an avalanche of new bad debts into the system," Mr. Fiorillo said, "the banks do not appear to have enough resources to cope comfortably with the problem."
The wave of bankruptcies is forcing banks to sell shares they hold, seeking to raise money to cover losses. That, along with sales by foreigners, has contributed to a drop in stock prices -- further eroding the value of investment portfolios.
ING Barings estimates that the more than seven trillion yen in profit that Japanese banks boasted last year, when the stock market had a miniature recovery, had as of July turned into roughly 500 billion yen in losses with the market's fall.
In addition, the agency charged with overhauling the financial system, the Financial Reconstruction Commission, has been buffeted by a series of scandals that created a revolving door in its leadership and undermined its power and credibility. In the last 10 months, the commission has had four chiefs, two of whom were forced to resign.
"The head of the organization has been changed too frequently, and that is not good," said Hakuo Yanagisawa, the member of Parliament who served for a year as the commission's first chief before he was replaced in a routine cabinet shuffle.
To critics, all this suggests that the government must find some way of overcoming popular resistance to injecting more money into the banking system. "Public funds are going to be used," Mr. Shiozaki said, "either through the Deposit Insurance Corporation or by letting banks go bust, or injecting more capital into them."
 Friday morning, Moody's Investors Service cut Japan's domestic-currency credit rating one notch, to Aa2, saying the government was running up too much debt in its efforts to ignite economic growth.
But others think that Mr. Shiozaki and his like are alarmists. "The problems emerging now are more or less within the scope of what we anticipated," Mr. Yanagisawa said.
Still accorded a great deal of respect, he is credited with forcing the consolidation that has reconfigured the landscape of Japanese banking. Bankers feared him and reformers praised him.
It was during his tenure that Long-Term Credit, once the flagship of the Japanese banking system, was sold to a group of foreigners led by Ripplewood Holdings L.L.C., a private equity firm based in New York. That move has had significant repercussions. Long-Term Credit, now known as the Shinsei Bank, refused to participate in the debt restructuring plan for Sogo.
Ripplewood seemed aware when it bought the Long-Term Credit Bank that many of its loans were effectively unrecoverable. It demanded that the government promise to fully compensate the bank on any loans that fell in value by 20 percent or more for three years after the sale -- even though Tokyo had supposedly transferred all bad loans from the bank to the Deposit Insurance Corporation long before.
Many politicians now argue that the government agreed to that provision because it also knew that a good portion of Long-Term Credit's loan portfolio was suspect, but could not win political sanction to pull the plug on well-connected companies like Sogo, Daiei, Kumagai Gumi and the Saison group -- which have strong ties to leaders of the ruling party.
Yoshimi Watanabe, a Liberal Democrat in the lower house of Parliament, says that this failure to weed out bad debts thoroughly and consign them to the Deposit Insurance Corporation was a basic flaw in the whole bank rescue program.
"The original evaluation of those loans was totally wrong," he said. "The banking bureau at the Ministry of Finance was claiming these loans were 'gray' loans, not bad loans, but in fact these loans were to companies that had a high probability of going bankrupt or were effectively bankrupt already."
Mr. Yanagisawa acknowledged that some assumptions made when the Financial Reconstruction Commission was established have proved faulty. "We had hoped that those companies would have made strenuous efforts to restructure themselves in the period before their loans were transferred to Shinsei," he said. He also said government economic forecasts had been too rosy, skewing projections about corporate recovery.
But Mr. Yanagisawa insists that today's problems are largely ones of perception, not asset quality.
"There is no one who can explain to the Japanese public that these problems are within the bounds of what we had anticipated," he said. "Government authorities had envisaged this scenario."

As Prices Rise, Nations Ask For More Oil

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
As OPEC prepares to meet this weekend in Vienna, it finds itself on familiar ground, with oil prices hovering at worrying heights and nervous industrialized nations demanding more oil, fearful of an end to good economic times.
A little more than two months ago, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries convened under similar circumstances and responded by increasing production by 708,000 barrels a day. In fact, since the beginning of the year, OPEC has raised production by nearly three million barrels a day, a significant amount over a short period. 
 Yet the price of crude oil, despite occasional dips, has stayed stubbornly high. Yesterday in New York, the price of oil rose as high as $35.46 a barrel, the highest price since the Persian Gulf war, before slipping back to $35.39, a gain of 49 cents, or 1.4 percent.
At a United Nations summit meeting in New York yesterday, President Clinton said the price of oil was too steep and encouraged OPEC to raise output. On Wednesday, Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, said that energy costs were "unacceptably high" and that oil-producing nations should increase production enough to reduce prices to $20 to $25 a barrel.
Facing such pressures, OPEC is expected to open the taps once again when its session concludes on Sunday or Monday.
But the price of oil will most likely remain high, with few analysts expecting it to fall far below $30 a barrel in the coming months.
"If there is a cooling-off, prices will go from $34 a barrel to maybe $31, not $25," said Roger Diwan, managing director of the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting group in Washington. "The problem is not, are prices going to stay high, but more, are they going to go up? How will OPEC avoid a flare-up to $40 a barrel?"
Concerned about the political fallout from high heating oil prices in an election year, the Clinton administration has increased pressure on Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the cartel, to coax a large production increase from OPEC. But the cartel is already exceeding its official quota by about 670,000 barrels a day, industry experts estimate. An increase of 700,000 barrels a day would preserve the status quo, making the "cheating" official. Oil traders say that an increase of at least 800,000 barrels would keep prices stable, and one million barrels a day would dampen them a bit.
But the persistence of high prices has as much to do with conditions within the countries that import oil as it does with OPEC's tinkering on the supply side. The increased OPEC supply has been quickly consumed by thriving economies that demand greater amounts of fuel to keep goods and people moving.
In the United States, the anxiety that has buoyed oil prices has less to do with OPEC and more to do with federal statistics that show supplies of heating oil, especially in the Northeast, are far lower than last year.
"Since gasoline inventories were low going into the summer driving season, refiners concentrated their efforts on producing gasoline, which meant they have not been able to rebuild distillate stocks ahead of the winter heating season," said Vincent Lauerman, senior economist with the Canadian Energy Research Institute in Calgary, Alberta. "We were playing catch-up with gasoline stocks before and we're playing catch-up with heating oil now."
Moreover, United States refineries are now exporting more heating oil than the country imports, industry experts say. A Kuwaiti refinery that supplies much of the world's heating oil was disabled by an explosion this summer, which drastically cut the amount of heating oil available. In Europe, Mexico and Brazil, tight supplies of heating oil have driven prices higher than they are here, drawing fuel to those regions and out of the United States. The federal government is now looking at ways to curb such exports.
Because of the great lag in stockpiling, few think that even a drastic increase in production by OPEC will allow American refineries to replenish their heating oil reserves by the winter. If the weather turns bitter, the Northeast, which consumes most of the country's heating oil, could face the same price increases as it did last winter.
OPEC members, while publicly agreeing that crude prices are too high, have also said that it was a problem of demand, not supply. The fragmented priorities of the 12 sovereign states within OPEC have made it hard for the cartel to answer the pleas of oil-hungry nations like the United States.
Nearly all the OPEC members are producing at capacity, except for Saudi Arabia. If overall production rose sharply and prices fell, few countries could make up for the loss in revenue by increasing volume. That revenue, in turn, often constitutes up to 75 percent of the budgets of OPEC nations.
"We think there is a good balance at this point between offer and demand," said Hector Ciavaldini, president of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., the state oil company.
With revenue so high, there are also differing views about a fair and favorable price for a barrel of oil. "The reasonable price keeps shifting," said Leonidas E. Drollas, chief economist for the Center for Global Energy Studies, a British research group. "When the price was $10, OPEC said $15 would be reasonable. When it was $17, they said $20. Now some think $30 is reasonable."
The cartel is also afraid of overproducing and touching off a free fall in prices, which occurred two years ago. Cartel members and non-OPEC countries are developing new wells as fast as possible to take advantage of the high oil prices. Over the next year or two, new fields will bring supply closer in line with high worldwide demand and probably lead to a downturn in oil prices, experts said.
"OPEC is terrified that if they push too many barrels out now, in three months they'll be looking at rapidly falling prices," Mr. Drollas said. "And then, it won't be easy to pull things back."

Skipping the Charm, President of Iran Chastises His Country's Reformers and the U.S.

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

 BODY:
President Mohammad Khatami of Iran criticized his country's democratic reformers yesterday for their unrealistic expectations and urged his people to avoid extremes in the name of promoting either security or freedom.
At a news conference in a meeting room of the United Nations Plaza Hotel, Mr. Khatami also criticized the international outrage over his country's prosecution and conviction of a group of Jews as spies and ruled out an official dialogue with the United States until Washington changed its ways. 
 Mr. Khatami, a mid-level cleric trained in philosophy, was swept into office in an upset landslide victory in 1997 on a platform promoting tolerance and the rule of law. But between smiles, he was defensive as he fielded tough questions about the recent setbacks in Iran's fledgling reform movement.
Speaking in Persian and dressed in the turban, robe and cloak that identify him as a cleric, Mr. Khatami made little effort to charm journalists, as he did during his maiden voyage to the United Nations two years ago. Back then, he told journalists how he had started out as a journalist and editor, expressed his admiration for the American Puritans, summarized the definition of justice in Plato's "Republic" and said he wished he could be a tourist and spend up to a month in America.
Yesterday, he stressed that his country's moves toward democracy should not be compared with countries in the West with two to three centuries of experience, and he called for moderation.
"You cannot endanger security for the sake of freedom and you cannot endanger freedom for the sake of security," Mr. Khatami said. "This is a delicate balance."
Describing his people as "impatient," he said that "the demands of the people should not rise beyond possibilities." Complicating matters are the constant complaints about the country's inflation and high unemployment, especially among young people, which, he said, "add to certain expectations not in sync with the possibilities of the times."
He warned against extremism, which he said "in any form, any direction is unwanted, whether in the name of freedom and supporting people's rights or in the name of security and suppressing people's rights."
Mr. Khatami suggested that he might not run for re-election next May, although Iran's state-run television quoted him recently as saying he would run again. And he seemed to distance himself from the reform movement that was sparked after his victory, saying, "Let me remind you that I did not come in the name of reform."
The Iranian president is caught in the middle of an intense and dangerous power struggle between reformers and conservatives in Iran. Increasingly, conservative forces opposed to democratic reform who enjoy the financial backing of well-placed power brokers have been willing to use any means, including violence, to maintain a hold on various spheres of power.
Most recently, vigilantes, many of them armed with batons and other weapons, took over the airport and forcibly prevented two reformist leaders from speaking in the western industrial city of Khurramabad, sparking days of rioting with students in which a policeman was killed and more than 100 people were injured.
In addition, in the past several months, more than a score of Iran's reformist newspapers and magazines have been shut down, many of its reformist journalists and clerics have been put into prison, and its judiciary, dominated by ultraconservative clerics, is determined to punish any behavior it considers un-Islamic.
Mr. Khatami has struggled to prevent violent confrontations by calling over and over for calm. But since nationwide riots last year, students have become more organized and are beginning to say that passive resistance will no longer work.
In his news conference yesterday, Mr. Khatami also said the international reaction to the case of ten Iranian Jews and two Muslims convicted in July of espionage was overblown.
"Why do you never mention the Muslims convicted by the same court and who are still in prison for the same reasons?" he asked, adding, "If instead of these Jews they were Christians would the world still react as it did today?"
Asked why he did not intervene in the case, Mr. Khatami stressed that the executive branch should not interfere in the work of the judiciary. But he added that the cases are before the appeals court, and expressed the hope that "no one will be convicted beyond their actual guilt."
Mr. Khatami played down the importance of a recent meeting in New York between Iranian parliamentary deputies and American Congressman as "unplanned."
He also ruled out the possibility that the meeting might be a prelude to higher level meetings with American officials. Citing "serious issues" dividing the two nations, Mr. Khatami called on the United States to "confess" its involvement in the coup orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency in 1953 that overthrew the government of Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh and restored Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to power. "This confession will be a big step forward," he said.
When reminded that Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright essentially apologized for the 1953 coup in a speech on Iran last March, Mr. Khatami listed other grievances against the United States, including economic sanctions and the Clinton administration's opposition to the construction of a pipeline through Iran to ship oil and gas from the Caspian Sea.
"In the West, people still refuse to understand that the cheapest, fastest route transferring energy from the Caspian is through Iran," Mr. Khatami said. He also cited American "allegations" against Iran, a reference to American assertions that Iran is involved in sponsoring international terrorism and is developing weapons of mass destruction, including a nuclear weapon.
He called on the United States to offer "apologies" and "practical measures" to prove that the nature of the relationship has changed. "Unfortunately, the Americans have been less inclined to do that," he said.
Earlier in the morning, at a breakfast with a small number of journalists, many of whom Mr. Khatami knows, he was more relaxed. When Christiane Amanpour of CNN asked him a pointed question, just as he dug into his cornflakes, he replied: "Is this an interview or a friendly conversation over breakfast? Allow me to continue our friendly chat."

HEADLINE: An Overlooked Beauty: Corporate Bonds Are Very Cheap

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
WHICH market do you believe?
A look at the American equity market shows a generally positive picture. Valuations are high, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index is near record levels. Clearly, productivity and profits are expected to stay high for the indefinite future. 
 But in the credit markets, the outlook appears much bleaker. There, money is becoming harder to find, and the price is expensive. Lower-quality borrowers always have to pay more than safe ones, but this year the spreads have widened significantly. That would be expected if people feared a recession, but then one would also expect to see the stock market doing much worse than it is.
Part of the explanation for this split is simple supply and demand. The government is buying back Treasury bonds, so yields on those securities may have been pushed lower than they otherwise would be. But companies are borrowing at a rapid pace even though investors have not been very eager to buy bonds. Bob Prince, the research director at Bridgewater Associates, a money management firm, says higher rates have been needed to lure overseas buyers, who now buy about a third of corporate debt.
Until recently, the widening spreads meant that borrowers paid more, but credit to companies that are willing to pay the tab did not really seem restricted. The banks have been willing lenders, but there are now scattered signs that they are growing more cautious. Since late last year, more and more banks have been telling the Federal Reserve that they are tightening credit standards. The default rate on junk bonds has been creeping up, even as the economy hums along with rapid growth.
This fall may prove to be the testing time for capital markets. Wall Street is gearing up for another big dose of initial public offerings, and Europeans -- who have provided a lot of the capital to finance American markets -- need to raise a lot of money to finance wireless telephone licenses that have fetched amazing bids at government auctions in Europe. If investors don't put up enough capital, stocks could suffer far more than bond prices.
For investors, something can be said for buying what others don't want. Just now, that is debt. Corporate bonds won't do well if the economy goes belly up, and they will not perform as well as stocks if corporate profits keep booming for years and years. But within that range of economic outcomes is a middle ground that favors bonds.
Martin Fridson, Merrill Lynch's junk bond guru, reports that the spreads of junk bond yields over Treasuries are now far higher than his economic model would forecast -- higher, in fact, than at any time in the past save for a brief period in 1998-99 after the Russian default and Asian crisis, when investors feared a worldwide recession.
Mr. Prince, the Bridgewater analyst, calculates that the divergence between the pricing of stocks and of corporate bonds "is near a 40-year high" because the bond market has priced in plenty of risk of economic disappointment while the stock market sees little risk.
That situation is not likely to last forever. There is plenty of reason to conclude that corporate bonds are a better buy than stocks right now, and investors may be starting to do just that. Though mutual fund buyers have shunned corporate bond funds this year, AMG Data Services last night reported a surge of money into such funds in the week ended Wednesday, with junk bond funds doing particularly well. The tide may be turning.

HEADLINE: Vitriol Flows in Race for Congress;
Accusations Overshadow Issues in Bronx Contest

SERIES: NEW YORK PRIMARY: 17th Congressional District

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
First came the tax returns.
In just one afternoon in a week that he will not soon forget, Larry B. Seabrook saw his race for Congress rocked by a tabloid revelation that he had filed joint tax returns even after he and his wife were divorced. There was the added tidbit that both Mr. Seabrook, a state senator from the Bronx, and his former wife maintained that they were unaware of their divorce until years after it became official. The day wasn't over yet, and neither was his opponent, who accused the senator of breaking the law and called for a criminal investigation. 
 It was in that same tumultuous week that Mr. Seabrook went on to accuse his opponent, United States Representative Eliot L. Engel, of being so conniving and desperate to win re-election that he had illegally obtained the information from sealed divorce records and leaked it to the news media. And it was during that week that Mr. Seabrook said he would go to court himself to seek criminal charges against Mr. Engel for illegally obtaining his most private information.
Mr. Seabrook then took his complaints to the doorstep of Mr. Engel's office, holding a news conference to accuse his opponent of a list of misdeeds. But Mr. Seabrook was ultimately upstaged by a woman who brought the news conference to a screeching halt by falling to the ground and screaming incoherently about being Mr. Seabrook's wife. That sent a frightened Mr. Seabrook dashing from the scene, fearful, he said, that the woman might have been carrying a weapon.
As that single week in its life would indicate, this primary battle in the 17th Congressional District, which includes parts of the Bronx and some of Westchester County, is not your typical political contest. With a seemingly endless stream of vitriol, the campaign has provided voters with a box-seat view of everything from charges of racism on one hand to anti-Semitism on the other. There have been accusations of sabotage from one side, of malfeasance from the other; complaints about political betrayal from one camp and of demagoguery from the other. And added to that mix have been enough revelations about Mr. Seabrook's marital woes to provide a season's worth of scripts for a soap opera.
The race features Mr. Engel, a 53-year-old white incumbent, who is working feverishly -- some say desperately -- to get re-elected in a district whose demographics have shifted dramatically, from the mostly white electorate that first sent him to Congress 12 years ago to its current overwhelmingly black and brown majority.
And it is also the story of Mr. Seabrook, 49, a black state senator, who has invoked the theme of black political empowerment in a campaign that has been marred by a string of embarrassing revelations that have portrayed him as acting injudiciously at best -- and illegally at worst.
"It is not a pretty thing to watch," said J. Philip Thompson, a professor of political science at Columbia University. "The effect of all this activity has been to push issues completely out of the campaign. This is a district that has a crime problem and a drug problem," Mr. Thompson said. "There are important issues regarding job opportunities, and how to provide them. But none of that is really being addressed in this campaign. It's more like some strange circus. And for most voters, it's disheartening and discouraging."
It has also been highly political. For years, Mr. Engel, who was first elected in 1988, has been preparing for the possibility of a challenge by Mr. Seabrook. In previous election years, Mr. Seabrook, whose State Senate district covers about half of the Congressional district, talked about running for the seat, only to change his mind before the nominating petitions were due.
But this year was different.
Mr. Seabrook said he had long watched the changing demographics of the district and concluded that a black candidate could win the seat, based on the minority population. The 17th Congressional District was about 60 percent white when Mr. Engel first ran. But it is now only about 22 percent white, with the balance being mostly black and Hispanic.
For years, Mr. Seabrook has criticized Mr. Engel as an inattentive incumbent who spends far more time at his home in Maryland than in the district. And he has routinely ridiculed Mr. Engel, saying that the congressman's major accomplishment had been to get to the House of Representatives chamber early enough each January to get an aisle seat during the State of the Union message so that he could be seen on national television shaking the president's hand.
Having raised more than $100,000, Mr. Seabrook entered the race this year with his slogan of "History in the Making," his campaign's expressed proposition of electing the first black congressman to represent the Bronx.
But as Mr. Seabrook was busy putting together his campaign for Congress, Mr. Engel's aides were also busy, collecting information on Mr. Seabrook. They chronicled, for example, Mr. Seabrook's attendance record in the State Senate and his high rate of absenteeism. They gathered records indicating that Mr. Seabrook sought reimbursement for travel expenses to Albany for more days than the Senate was in session.
And Mr. Engel -- and not a few of his supporters -- suggested that, in appealing to black pride, Mr. Seabrook had injected race into the campaign in a bold and racist appeal to black voters.
The next shoe to drop came at the hands of the Democratic organization in the Bronx. Mr. Seabrook, who has long had an arm's-length relationship with the party, was suddenly endorsed by its chairman, Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez. Mr. Ramirez, who had never before withheld his support from a Democratic incumbent congressman, explained his decision by saying that Mr. Engel had grown ineffective and that he had gotten out of touch with the district's constituents.
Mr. Engel responded by suggesting that Mr. Ramirez's decision was based more on ethnic politics. He said that Mr. Ramirez had entered a deal under which Mr. Seabrook's endorsement by the party would require the senator to publicly support the mayoral bid of Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president. That move, Mr. Engel reasoned, would draw Seabrook supporters -- meaning black voters -- to Mr. Ferrer's camp.
More stinging, however, was the charge by some of Mr. Engel's supporters that the endorsement was an anti-Jewish maneuver, aimed at sabotaging the career of a promising liberal representative. Mr. Engel lent his own voice to that view, even suggesting that Hillary Rodham Clinton was harming her standing with Jewish voters by not supporting him (Mrs. Clinton has refused to take sides in contested Democratic primary races).
Not surprisingly, the race has split Democrats in the district and beyond. Mr. Engel has been endorsed by former Mayor Edward I. Koch, as well as the Democratic Party organization of Westchester County. Mr. Seabrook has been endorsed by the Rev. Al Sharpton, as well as most Democratic officials in the Bronx.
There is a third candidate in the race: Arsenio Zayas, 59, a former police officer and retired lawyer.
At times in their campaigns, Mr. Engel and Mr. Seabrook have discussed views they have in common. They talk about the need to lower class sizes, for example, or to find money to rehabilitate the schools in the district, to support federal initiatives to make health care more widely available and to enhance economic opportunities for small businesses in the district. But they have been far more vocal in their condemnation of each other.
Many of the dozens of pieces of campaign literature Mr. Engel has sent to voters bear nothing about voting for the congressman's re-election. Instead, many are devoted entirely to exposing what they say are Mr. Seabrook's flaws and ethical troubles. And Mr. Seabrook shares with anyone who will listen his description of Mr. Engel as being chronically absent from the district and unconcerned about its voters.
"Eliot Engel offers nothing to the people of this district," Mr. Seabrook said. "To those of us who live here, he is a ghost."
Mr. Engel has a ready retort. "Larry Seabrook is the biggest scofflaw in the New York State Legislature," the congressman said this week. "He fails to file campaign disclosure information, and there is always some ethical cloud hanging around his head," Mr. Engel said. "He is the one going around saying that he should be elected because he is black. He started this campaign on a negative note."
All that said, both men deny that they are operating negative campaigns.
"Throughout this campaign, I have stressed the positive things in my record," Mr. Engel insisted. "And I think things are going very positively for me. I have been talking to people about the fact that I have put in more than $200 million into this district in the last four years. And I talk to people about the fact that I have five district offices, which is more than any other member of Congress from New York."
Mr. Engel has denied having any responsibility for disseminating information about Mr. Seabrook's taxes or his divorce. Still, it is clear that many voters, particularly black and Hispanic ones in the district, find that difficult to believe.
"A lot of people in the community believe that Mr. Engel bears responsibility for the negative tone of the campaign," said City Councilman Adolfo Carrion Jr., who represents the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx. "Early on, they sent out a barrage of negative campaign literature. And that set the tone."
And many other voters, particularly white ones, see Mr. Seabrook as a divisive figure, more inclined to rely on race than merit in presenting himself before the voters.
"Many people in this area believe he is running for the wrong reason," said Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, an Engel supporter who represents the Riverdale and Kingsbridge areas of the Bronx. "And that reason is simply demographics."
To many Democrats in the district and beyond, the biggest question is how either will be able to emerge after the primary election on Tuesday as a unifying voice, regardless of the outcome. All of this has made this unusual and peculiar campaign something that many politicians and voters are already lamenting, despite the uncertainty of its outcome.
"This race has been mostly about mudslinging," said the Rev. Hillary Gaston, the pastor of the Parkchester Baptist Church in the Bronx. "Neither one of them has put forth a meaningful agenda that would excite anyone. People want to know, 'What are you doing for our community?' "

HEADLINE: Veto of Estate-Tax Repeal Survives Vote in the House

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Supporters of a bill to repeal the federal tax on large estates failed today to overturn President Clinton's veto of the measure, killing the issue for the year in legislative terms but leaving it very much alive politically.
Republicans said they were eager to take the debate to the campaign trail, where they said a repeal would attract support from small-business owners, farmers, entrepreneurs and other voters who object to having part of their wealth taxed when they pass it to their heirs. 
 Democrats, the majority of whom lined up with Mr. Clinton in opposition to the bill, said they would continue to make their case that while the estate tax should be reduced for family-owned farms and businesses, the measure that failed today would eat up too much of the projected budget surplus and disproportionately reward a tiny percentage of the richest families.
The bill passed the House and the Senate earlier this year, with the support of nearly all Republicans and some Democrats. Mr. Clinton vetoed it last week.
Overriding the veto would have required a two-thirds vote in both chambers, and in the House today supporters of the bill fell well short.
The vote was 274 votes in favor of overturning the veto and 157 in favor of sustaining it. It would have taken 290 votes to overturn the veto if all 435 House members had voted, or 288 of the 431 votes cast today.
When the House passed the bill in June by a vote of 279 to 136, 65 Democrats voted in favor. Today, despite pressure from party leaders and phone calls to some of those 65 from Mr. Clinton, 53 Democrats still bucked their party to support an override.
In a statement after the vote, Mr. Clinton commended those representatives who had voted to uphold the veto and kept up his attack on the bill and the overall Republican effort to push through a series of tax cuts.
"This is a misguided bill that provides a huge tax cut to the most well-off Americans at the expense of working families," Mr. Clinton said. "It is a key ingredient of a Republican tax plan that would leave nothing for Social Security, Medicare, education or a voluntary, affordable prescription drug benefit."
Next week the Republican leadership in Congress is expected to try to override the president's veto of its other main tax bill this year, a tax cut for married couples. Republicans acknowledged that they would probably fail, but said that again highlighting Mr. Clinton's opposition to tax cuts would help them retain control of the House and help put Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the White House.
Vice President Al Gore opposed the estate tax bill passed by Congress, but has supported a smaller plan to reduce the tax on family-owned farms and businesses. Mr. Bush, who included repeal of the estate tax in his $1.3 trillion tax cut proposal, said in a statement today that if he is elected president, "there will be no veto to override" because he will "sign the abolition of the death tax into law."
The legislation would have phased out the federal estate and gift tax over the next 10 years, with much of the tax disappearing only at the end of that period.
Under current law, the tax is levied only on estates valued at $675,000 or more, an amount already scheduled to rise to $1 million by 2006. Family-owned businesses and farms have a special exemption up to $1.3 million. Above those levels, estates are subject to a graduated tax with a top rate of 55 percent.
Because of the exemptions, the tax actually effects relatively few estates -- fewer than 48,000 this year. But it concerns groups with considerable political leverage, including the small-business and farm lobbies, as well as the wealthy.
Democrats renewed their call today for a compromise measure they offered earlier. The Democratic alternative would immediately raise the exemption for family-owned farms and businesses to $2 million per person, or $4 million per couple.
But Republicans again rebuffed the Democratic plan, saying that it was built around tax rules that are complicated and narrowly drawn, and that it would benefit only a tiny percentage of people.
"There is only one way to rid the code of this immoral, unfair and economically unsound tax, and that's to eliminate it," said Representative Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington.
Democrats said that Congress should be concentrating on issues that are of concern to all voters, not just to the 2 percent who have to worry about estate taxes.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, said his constituents never mentioned the estate tax when talking to him about their concerns. Instead, he said, they press him for action on adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, and on education, shoring up Social Security and keeping guns out of schools.
"People do not want to spend the majority of this surplus on tax cuts, and they sure don't want to spend it on tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans," Mr. Gephardt said.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Gets Powerful Help From Cabinet

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: CARBONDALE, Pa., Sept. 7

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore may be trying to rid himself of President Clinton, but he is making no attempt to escape from the Clinton cabinet.
In fact, the vice president is relying more and more these days on the expertise, advice and support of a gallery of members and former members of the cabinet. 
 Nowhere was this more evident than in Cleveland on Wednesday, when Mr. Gore delivered a major speech laying out his vision of the economy for the next decade. At his side was Robert E. Rubin, who, as Mr. Clinton's former treasury secretary and one of the most respected figures who have played a role in the current prosperity, is regarded as the administration's economic superstar.
Mr. Rubin provided not only his presence and reputation to vouch for Mr. Gore's ability to keep the economy sound. He helped put in place the fundamental principles -- chiefly, paying down the debt and heeding the bond market -- that underpin Mr. Gore's own economic plan.
Mr. Rubin was not the only Clinton appointee helping Mr. Gore on his economic blueprint. The list of brainstormers reads like a who's who of the Clinton administration's economic elite -- Lawrence H. Summers, the current treasury secretary; Erskine B. Bowles, Mr. Clinton's former chief of staff; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, former chairwoman of Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers; and Gene Sperling, the president's top in-house economic adviser.
The degree to which Clinton appointees are campaigning on behalf of the vice president is rare in modern political history and reflects the confluence of several factors: Mr. Clinton's serious investment in getting Mr. Gore elected; Mr. Gore's need to have people with policy expertise and marquee names vouching for his participation in important decisions within the Clinton administration; the desire by the cabinet members themselves to use to the fullest their waning months in the limelight and, perhaps for some, a desire to improve their chances of appointment to a Gore administration.
There is nothing illegal about cabinet secretaries' electioneering. The Hatch Act prevents government employees from spending official time on political work, but presidential appointees are exempt from that restriction.
Having cabinet-level experts at his disposal is an enormous advantage of incumbency, and Mr. Gore has not been shy about using it.
While Mr. Gore is deeply familiar with policy details, his ability to call forth the armies of the administration to speak on his behalf have bolstered one of the central tenets of his candidacy -- that he is, as Bill Clinton has often argued, the most qualified person in history to run for the presidency.
Greg Simon, a senior Gore adviser, said the campaign was thrilled to be able to showcase the cabinet. "We've had the most stable cabinet of any recent administration, so these are people who have become authorities," he said. "There's no substitute for having Bob Rubin talk about economic prosperity or Donna Shalala talk about health or Andrew Cuomo talk about inner cities. Each of these people is a shining star."
He also said that the cabinet's campaigning for Mr. Gore was a benefit of his having been so involved in the administration. "This isn't a situation where you have a vice president and cabinet warring among itself, the way Johnson and Kennedy did, or an office kept in the dark, the way Quayle was," he said. "You have a vice presidential staff that was fully integrated into all the cabinet agencies." Marshall Wittmann, a conservative policy analyst at the Hudson Institute, said that the extent to which current and former members of the administration were working for Mr. Gore appeared "unprecedented."
"I don't know of a single former official who has come back and worked so prominently for a vice president," he said.
He suggested that such action showed both an extraordinary degree of loyalty within the administration as well as the degree of determination in helping Mr. Clinton establish a political legacy.
Moreover, he said, Mr. Gore's election would provide some "vindication" of Mr. Clinton's mixed tenure.
This is a tricky area for Mr. Gore to navigate. On the one hand, he says he is not running for a third Clinton term, and he has sought to close the Clinton chapter of his career.
He often says, as he did here today at a high-tech company, that he is not running on the "past performance" of the economy but on his own plan for a stronger economy in the future.
For months, Mr. Gore has routinely relied on Mr. Clinton's political appointees to advance his cause. Mr. Rubin even stumped with him in New Hampshire last winter. Many have been with the Clinton administration for years and are seen not so much as auditioning for a Gore administration but as making themselves more marketable for the private sector as the end of the Clinton era nears.
Virtually the entire cabinet has participated in one form or another in the Gore campaign. Most commonly, they are hosts for conference calls with reporters. Frequent conference-callers are Dr. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, who conducted one on Tuesday to critique Gov. George W. Bush's plan for prescription drug coverage.
A few days before, Dr. David A. Kessler, former head of the Food and Drug Administration and now dean of the Yale School of Medicine, took part in a conference call to preview a week of Gore speeches on health-care issues. A few days later, Ms. Tyson, who had served on the 1999 Medicare Commission, conducted a conference call to discuss Mr. Gore's plan to save Medicare.
Alexis M. Herman, Mr. Clinton's secretary of labor, has been one of the most visibly involved in Mr. Gore's campaign, particularly in his efforts to reach out to black voters. She and Rodney Slater, the transportation secretary, who is also black, were on hand to brief reporters when Mr. Gore addressed the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People last month in Baltimore. Ms. Herman also played an advisory role as part of Mr. Gore's vice-presidential screening committee and is part of the team working out the debate schedule.
One of the most striking examples of Mr. Gore's reliance on the Clinton cabinet was his selection earlier this summer of William M. Daley, Mr. Clinton's commerce secretary, as his campaign chairman to replace the ailing Tony Coelho.
Dr. Shalala, the health secretary, is one of the cabinet members most actively campaigning for Mr. Gore. She says she is doing so because she believes in Mr. Gore's proposals and admires his wife. "It's both a personal commitment to them and a real commitment on my part to the programs," she said in an interview.
She said she had made it clear that she was not interested in a job in a Gore administration. Moreover, she said, she just flat-out loves politics.
"I love the rough and tumble," she said.
She also said she closely follows the rules about having the campaign, not the taxpayers, pay for her political trips. But she also noted that cabinet secretaries are on duty 24 hours a day and get no vacation, and that part of their jobs are political.
One of those who seemed to be trying openly to parlay his position into a Gore administration was Bill Richardson, Mr. Clinton's energy secretary.
He was widely considered a possible vice-presidential running mate for Mr. Gore until problems within his department's purview derailed him.

HEADLINE: THE SUMMIT IN NEW YORK: THE OVERVIEW;
LEADERS DEBATE BROAD NEW ROLE FOR U.N. COUNCIL

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 7

 BODY:
With President Clinton and other government leaders filling seats usually occupied by their envoys, the Security Council moved today toward a new role for itself in a world where the rules have been rewritten by warlords, and the poor kill the poor over dwindling resources.
The unusual meeting, with 14 heads of government and a foreign minister gathered around the Council table, was intended to concentrate on peacekeeping problems, with a special emphasis on Africa. 
 But it very quickly turned to a far broader discussion about the causes of war in an age when ethnic cleansing, rape and mutilation have become the tactical hallmarks of pickup armies that terrorize populations often already weakened by poverty or disease. The issue was raised most prominently a year ago by Secretary General Kofi Annan, and was addressed vigorously today.
"Timing makes a big difference in the type of debate we will have today versus what it might have been 15, 20, 30 years ago," said Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
He told the Council that peacekeeping was often all that stood "between anarchy and some form of stability." Sierra Leone, where Britain has sent hundreds of peacekeepers, was an example, he added.
"Whether it is poverty or debt or aid and development, or infectious diseases or governance and the rule of law, we need a far broader concept of how we deal with these security issues for today's world," Mr. Blair said. "We cannot isolate conflict from the root causes of it."
But as the Council moved into new territory, other leaders addressing the summit meeting in the General Assembly kept to familiar attacks against the deep disparities between rich and poor nations. They demanded that the industrialized world offer more tangible aid to countries that have been left behind.
Like Mr. Annan and Mr. Blair, Mr. Clinton argued that peacekeeping meant thinking not only about weapons but also about water, schools, health and the environment.
"Some people will listen to this discussion and say, well, peacekeeping has something to do with security, but these other issues don't have anything to do with security and don't belong in the Security Council," he said. "This is my last meeting -- I just have to say I respectfully disagree. These issues will be more and more in the Security Council. Until we confront the iron link between deprivation, disease and war, we will never be able to create the peace that the founders of the United Nations dreamed of."
Mr. Clinton soon discovered he was not alone. Except for President Jiang Zemin of China, who argued stonily for the most restrictive definition of the Security Council's role, and Vladimir V. Putin, who in an unspoken reference to NATO was more preoccupied with opposing the use of force outside the Council's control, a significant number of national leaders echoed Mr. Clinton's call.
China and sometimes Russia argue that social issues should be left to the Economic and Social Council, which was established by the United Nations Charter to be a parallel body to the Security Council. It was given wide authority in social issues, including human rights and crime.
But Ecosoc, as it is known, has proved unwieldy with 54 members, ineffective and rarely innovative, despite the considerable efforts of American and European diplomats to reform it and give it greater authority.
Today, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh and President Jacques Chirac of France spoke at the Council of large-scale human rights abuses and disasters of other kinds affecting large numbers of vulnerable people.
It was talk like this that moved the Council to its first high-level debate on the thorny subject of when it has the right to intervene to save citizens, even if that means intruding on national sovereignty.
And at the end of the discussion, despite the lingering differences of opinion, the leaders unanimously adopted a resolution that called for, among other things, the development within the United Nations of "comprehensive and integrated strategies to address the root causes of conflicts, including their economic and social dimensions."
In the last year, since Secretary General Annan first raised this issue in the General Assembly, it has been the fodder of academic and policymaking debate. Today, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada told the Council -- meeting at head-of-state level for the first time since 1992 -- that it could not back away from the debate.
"Because if the Security Council is unable to adapt," Mr. Chretien said, "it will seriously undermine its credibility as a guarantor of peace, credibility that is essential to maintaining the moral authority of the U.N. as a whole."
Later, in a speech in the General Assembly, Mr. Chretien announced that Canada would establish an international panel of legal and political experts to study the issue of military intervention on humanitarian grounds, taking a major step toward making the discussion more concrete.
The credibility factor lurked behind much of what was said about peacekeeping and how the United Nations has been stumbling disastrously in trying to meet new challenges.
In opening the Council session, Mr. Annan laid bare the background against which United Nations peacekeeping has to work when he said, "Many in the present generation are losing confidence in the ability of the United Nations to make the difference between war and peace." This week's withdrawal of United Nations refugee workers from West Timor gave weight to his remarks.
Mr. Annan, a former head of peacekeeping who moved into the top job just as the United Nations was floundering over its role in the post-cold-war era, has ordered reviews of peacekeeping debacles in Rwanda and Bosnia and of the overall functioning of the department. The results have been very critical not only of the organization but also of its leading members, especially the United States.
"Too many vulnerable communities in too many regions of the world now hesitate to look to the United Nations to assist them in their hour of need," Mr. Annan said today. "No amount of resolutions or statements can change this reality. Only action can -- prompt, united and effective action, pursued with skill and discipline to halt the conflict and restore the peace. Only such determined action can restore the reputation of the United Nations as a credible force for peace and justice."
The United Nations peacekeeping department has 32 officers to provide military planning and guidance for 27,000 troops. An additional 8,600 civilian police officers are supervised by only nine police experts in New York. There are 15 political desk officers looking after 16 operations. Only 1.25 percent of the peacekeeping budget goes to headquarters administration, far too little, experts say, to allow for adequate planning.
The Security Council itself -- or at least its leading members -- are often the problem, said Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister who was chairman of the expert panel that studied overall United Nations peacekeeping and issued a critical report last month.
In an interview, Mr. Brahimi said interference from powerful nations in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations -- known in the parlance by the letters D.P.K.O. -- should stop.
"The big boys on the Security Council come through the back door and tell the D.P.K.O. and all of us here: 'Don't say this; don't say that. Don't ask for this, don't ask for that,' " he said. "They really influence us into self-censorship."
The Council's resolution today addressed some of Mr. Brahimi's concerns by speaking of better training and equipment for peacekeepers, a restructuring of the peacekeeping department and a search for new ways to finance the troops.

HEADLINE: The Big City;
A Liberal Case For Vouchers (No Kidding)

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
ROBERT B. REICH, the Democratic policy guru and friend of organized labor, entered enemy territory this week with a peace proposal of sorts. He wrote an article on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal proposing a scheme for school vouchers.
Mr. Reich is not the first liberal to come out for vouchers, but it is startling to see a defector with his credentials -- a former labor secretary, co-founder of the liberal magazine The American Prospect -- breaking with the Democratic Party and its union allies on a critical issue in an election season. Politically, it's a little like Milton Friedman coming out for bigger government. 
 But it's actually not much of a philosophical stretch for Mr. Reich, now a professor at Brandeis University. He sees vouchers as a way to achieve classic liberal goals. He wants to integrate schools, redistribute educational dollars and help the poor escape from inner-city schools. Besides revolutionizing education, his idea could be one of the most radical urban renewal programs ever.
Mr. Reich wants to scrap the entire current system of school financing. Tax revenues would be pooled, maybe at the state or the federal level, and given directly to parents in the form of "progressive" vouchers pegged to family income. The vouchers, redeemable at any certified private or public school, might be $12,000 for the least affluent students and $4,000 for the richest.
Public schools in the suburbs, which now often spend $9,000 per pupil, couldn't cover their costs with $4,000 vouchers. They would have to collect extra tuition from well-off students. They would also, Mr. Reich expects, look for another source of revenue: those $12,000 vouchers in the hands of city kids.
"The large vouchers would make it worthwhile to send vans to pick up and drop off groups of inner-city students," Mr. Reich writes. "Although the most intensive competition would center on the best-behaved poor kids whose parents were most aggressive in seeking out good schools, the large vouchers would spur schools to recruit and retain more difficult children as well."
Mr. Reich does not pretend that Greenwich's schools would be sending caravans down to the South Bronx. But it would be realistic, he said in an interview yesterday, to expect some Westchester schools near the Bronx to profit by taking in 5 or 10 percent of their students from across the city line. And there would presumably be a growing number of private schools eager for those vouchers.
"It's important to get central city kids out of public schools where social problems are concentrated," Mr. Reich said. "Americans are segregated by income more than ever before. It is a huge and growing problem. We know that forced busing doesn't work. Using vouchers is the only way I see to solve the problem."
THE voucher plan could be enormously valuable to cities in retaining the middle class, because parents would no longer see a house in a suburban school district as the only affordable way to get a good education for their children. That change would hardly gladden the suburbanites who already paid a premium for houses in those districts and now could be facing extra tuition payments, although some of them might welcome vouchers good for partial tuition at private schools.
So far, Mr. Reich has not been excommunicated from the Democratic Party. "I've been very surprised by the reaction," he said. "There have been several hundred phone and e-mail messages, and not a single one has been negative. People who are quite liberal Democrats say they like the idea because it deals with the central inequity of education, which is that less money is spent per pupil in poor communities than in rich communities."
Social justice for liberals, market incentives for conservatives -- the plan has everything going for it, except for one slight problem. No one expects it to be adopted any time soon, including Mr. Reich. "It's too radical a change for any politician to seriously entertain at the national level," he said. "It would have to bubble up from below. There would be have to be some experimentation at the state level."
It's hard to imagine New York politicians starting the experiment, given the power of the teachers' unions and the Democratic Party. But recent polls found that most voters in the city and the state supported vouchers, with support especially strong among blacks and Hispanics. Some Democrats may consider Mr. Reich a traitor to the party, but he seems to have a lot of company.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;
While Lieberman Baits Bush on Stump, Gore Rarely Mentions Him

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Mo., Sept. 6

 BODY:
On a day the Democrats devoted to trumpeting their economic goals, Vice President Al Gore, speaking in Cleveland, never mentioned the Republicans.
But in a speech on the same topic today at Southwest Missouri State University here, Mr. Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, spoke in dire terms of the economic plans of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee. Mr. Bush's proposals would "send us back down the drain of deficits, rising interest rates and rising unemployment," Mr. Lieberman said. 
 Mr. Lieberman has adopted the traditional role of the ticket's No. 2, taking the lead in attacking the opposition, allowing Mr. Gore to remain, if not above the fray, then less deeply mired in it. At every stop, Mr. Lieberman vows not to make personal attacks on Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, and so far he has not. But he has not hesitated to tear into their policies and strategies.
"He's running around signing a book of blank checks drawn on an account that his tax cuts have already depleted," Mr. Lieberman said today of Mr. Bush.
On Monday, he lit into Mr. Bush much more strongly than Mr. Gore did for refusing to take part in two of the three debates proposed by a bipartisan commission, stopping just short of accusing Mr. Bush of being afraid to debate.
"I think that Governor Bush is making an end run around the established rules of presidential debates," he said. "It's like one of the teams in the Super Bowl, a few weeks before the Super Bowl, saying, 'I don't want to play in that city, I don't want to play by those rules, and I don't want to play in front of so many people.' "
Democratic campaign officials acknowledge the difference between Mr. Lieberman's approach and Mr. Gore's but say it is not a result of any grand strategy. "It's what they're comfortable with," one aide said.
 
Campaigning High on a Hog
For the last two weeks, Medicare has been front and center in the national campaign. There have been days when the Democrats have talked about little else. So it must have been a surprise to Senator Lieberman when he took questions today from workers at a Harley-Davidson motorcycle plant in Kansas City, Mo., and the first query, from a young man, was this: "I notice none of you guys who are running are talking about Medicare."
Instead of becoming agitated, Mr. Lieberman gently corrected the misimpression and reiterated the points he and Vice President Gore had made dozens of times.
The senator seemed a bit out of place on the factory floor. Harley workers, it turns out, look a lot like the stereotype of Harley riders, with a sizable quotient of black T-shirts over jeans, beards, ponytails, sunglasses worn indoors and people who generally looked as if they might be auditioning for ZZ Top.
Mr. Lieberman, in jeans and a blue dress shirt, even went for a spin around the parking lot on the back of a hog driven by a company employee -- while wearing a helmet, of course. When it was noted that Michael S. Dukakis's image suffered when he was seen wearing a helmet -- in his case, while driving a tank -- during the 1988 presidential campaign, Mr. Lieberman said, "It was another act of courage."
 
Learning to Grin and Bear It
When Mr. Gore picked Mr. Lieberman as his running mate, the focus -- both in the news and in the senator's comments -- was on his being the first Jew nominated by a major party for national office.
Lately, Mr. Lieberman has shifted somewhat away from the topic, but others raise it so often that he could not drop it if he wanted.
At the motorcycle plant, a woman asked him how, if he became president, his religion would influence the selection of Supreme Court justices. He said his Judaism "doesn't specifically relate to these kinds of decisions."
This theme has led to some of the campaign's more awkward moments. At a recent rally in Claymont, Del., Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, pointed into the audience and said to Mr. Lieberman: "Joe, you see that woman over there? She's Jewish, you're Jewish, we're Catholic. But I say no purgatory for her. Straight to heaven."
The senator's smile never wavered.
 
Evoking an Unpopular War
At every stop, Mr. Lieberman mentions that Mr. Gore "volunteered for service in Vietnam." It seems an odd tribute, given that Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman came to oppose United States involvement in the war, as did tens of millions of other Americans.
But the explanation may lie in the fact that the line always draws hearty applause. And this mostly from crowds of Democrats, people who, presumably, would be less inclined than Republicans to view the war favorably. It is, if nothing else, a sign of America's continued ambivalence about the war.
Arnold Schmidt, a 49-year-old construction worker who heard Mr. Lieberman speak at a Labor Day festival in Detroit on Monday, said he was opposed to the war when it was under way and had not changed his views. But he cheered loudly at the mention of Mr. Gore's tour in the Army.
"He served his country, and you've got to respect that," said Mr. Schmidt, who escaped the draft by having a high lottery number. "If he didn't go, someone else would have went, like me."

EUROPE
 
AUSTRIA: E.U. REPORT DUE
A report commissioned by the European Union to help it decide whether to continue sanctions against Austria is to be presented today to the current holder of the rotating E.U. presidency, President Jacques Chirac of France. The sanctions were imposed in February after the far-right Freedom Party joined Austria's ruling coalition. The report was to evaluate the "respect" of the Austrian government for "common European values" as well as the evolution of the Freedom Party. Suzanne Daley (NYT) 

YUGOSLAVIA: GREEK MEETS MILOSEVIC
Foreign Minister George Papandreou of Greece met in Belgrade with President Slobodan Milosevic, the first NATO foreign minister to do so since the alliance bombed Yugoslavia last year. There was speculation about what larger message from the West Mr. Papandreou, left, might be passing on to Mr. Milosevic, given the lavish pre-election coverage his meeting with Mr. Milosevic, indicted for war crimes, received on state television. Mr. Papandreou also met opposition leaders. Steven Erlanger (NYT)
 
GREECE: TERRORISM ACCORD
Public Order Minister Michalis Chryssochoides will sign an accord in Washington today providing for cooperation with the F.B.I. in the fight against terrorism, organized crime, Internet espionage and drug smuggling. The government had resisted signing the accord for two years, but changed its position after a British military attache was assassinated in Athens in June and Greece was awarded the 2004 Olympic Games. Anthee Carassava (NYT)
 
TURKEY: GAY AMERICANS SEE SITES
The police provided extra security in Istanbul for about 800 gay Americans who toured historic sites without incident after being refused access to other locations in Turkey. The group told the State Department they were discriminated against after the police in the Aegean port of Kusadasi refused to allow them to tour Ephesus and other sites. Douglas Frantz (NYT)
 
ALBANIA: DESTROYING ARMS
With the help of the United States, Germany and Norway, Albania will destroy 100,000 small arms collected from civilians who stole them from army depots in 1997, officials said. More than 600,000 weapons were looted in the 1997 anarchy caused when fraudulent pyramid schemes collapsed, wiping out the savings of thousands of Albanians. (Reuters)
 
AFRICA
 
SOUTH AFRICA: PRESIDENTIAL BREAK-IN
A homeless man broke into President Thabo Mbeki's Cape Town residence and lived there for days before being arrested on Tuesday, The Star reported. A presidential spokeswoman said the 27-year-old intruder had not gained entry to the private quarters of Mr. Mbeki, who was away when the man broke in last Friday. (Agence France-Presse)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
CANADA: DEFECTION TO RIGHT
In the latest sign that Canada's new right-wing party is emerging from its western base, the Canadian Alliance won the loyalty of Jim Jones, the lone Tory member of Parliament from Ontario. The defection came two days after Brian Mulroney, a former Tory prime minister, described the dwindled state of his party as "difficult and challenging" and called Stockwell Day, leader of the Alliance, a "fine gentleman." Mr. Mulroney does not support the Alliance. James Brooke (NYT)
 
ARGENTINA: IMMUNITY VOTE
The lower house of Congress, under pressure from a bribes-for-votes scandal, voted to end a sweeping immunity protecting lawmakers, judges and government ministers from prosecution. It will now go to the Senate, where it is expected to be approved. (Reuters)
 
MEXICO: AIDE COMMITS SUICIDE
An undersecretary in the Commerce Department killed himself in a growing controversy over the management of a national car registry, senior officials said. The registry was run by a former Argentine military officer, hired by the Commerce Department, who stands accused by a Spanish judge of murder and torture under Argentina's military junta two decades ago. Officials said the undersecretary, Raul Ramos Tercero, left behind six suicide notes denying culpability. (NYT)
 
CUBA: NEWS BUREAUS ALLOWED
The Chicago Tribune and The Dallas Morning News learned that they will be allowed to open offices in Havana, joining The Associated Press and CNN as the only United States news organizations with bureaus in the country. (AP)

ISRAEL: GUARDS IN BEATINGS DETAINED
A Jerusalem court ordered the detention of three Israeli border police officers after they beat three Palestinian laborers on Wednesday and photographed one another stepping on their victims. The swift legal action against the officers, who confessed under questioning, was taken after Israel Radio broadcast graphic accounts of the beatings by one of the laborers and their Israeli supervisor. Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, above, called the officers' behavior beastly. Joel Greenberg (NYT)
 
ISRAEL: GENERAL STEPS DOWN
Israel's military commander in the West Bank will leave his post as a result of a bungled raid in the West Bank in which three Israeli soldiers were killed by their own men, Israel's army chief said. Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz said he had accepted the resignation of Brig. Gen. Shlomo Oren. (Reuters)

AFGHANISTAN: NEW TALIBAN GAINS
The ruling Taliban militia claimed more gains against opposition forces in the northern province of Takhar as thousands of people fled the region to escape the fighting. Taliban fighter jets pounded opposition positions, said the opposition spokesman, Muhammad Abil. It was not possible to confirm the number of dead, reported by the Russian news agency Interfax to total 800. (AP)

THE POLLS
 
BUSH AND GORE VIRTUALLY TIED
In the first spate of post-Labor Day national polls, traditionally considered among the most important of the campaign season, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas are locked in a tight race, with Mr. Gore retaining the momentum he gained after his party's convention and having made great strides among women, Democrats and independents. He also appears to have made considerable headway in turning around negative views of his personality and demeanor. In addition, he maintains an advantage on the issues. One poll has Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush absolutely tied, one has a virtual tie, and one has Mr. Gore leading but by a margin well within the margin of error. A poll of 810 likely voters by ABC News and the Washington Post shows Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush at 47 percent each. A Gallup Organization poll of 750 likely voters for CNN and USA Today has Mr. Gore leading 47 percent to 44 percent. And a Zogby poll of 1,001 likely voters shows a six-point lead for Mr. Gore, 46 percent to 40 percent. All three polls have margins of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points and were taken Monday through Wednesday. Janet Elder (NYT) 

THE RUNNING MATES
 
LIEBERMAN IN TEXAS
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut ventured deep into Bush country yesterday, showing up in Houston, and he plans to return on Monday, signaling the Democrats' new-found confidence and boldness to campaign in a state they have almost no hope of carrying. Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, plans to hold a campaign forum in Houston on Friday on children's health care, an event that will no doubt include a few digs at George W. Bush's record on the subject as governor of Texas. On Monday, Mr. Lieberman will be the draw at a Democratic National Committee fund-raising luncheon at the home of Thomas J. Meredith, the former chief financial officer of Dell Computer and now the managing director of Dell's venture capital unit. The Democratic committee expects to raise $500,000 at the lunch. Vice President Al Gore's campaign aides concede that he has no chance of winning Texas, but they note that an opponent's home state can be a useful forum for attacks, as Michael S. Dukakis learned in 1988, when Mr. Bush's father showed up in Massachusetts to lament water pollution in Boston harbor. Richard Perez-Pena and John Broder (NYT)
 
CHENEY DUCKS A BULLET
The suspense was palpable. When Dick Cheney took a tour yesterday through a Londonderry, N.H., optics firm to emphasize his ticket's commitment to building a higher tech military, all eyes fell on an outsized gray helmet festooned with the latest in panoramic night vision goggles that was sitting on a table in the middle of the factory floor. Visions of one of the most-ridiculed images of the 1988 campaign, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts donning an unbecoming helmet in an ill-fated photo opportunity aboard a 63-ton tank, danced through cameramen's heads. As Mr. Cheney handled the helmet at Insight Technology Inc., an eager photographer called out, "Do you think it's the right size?" "Come on, guys, you don't think I'm going to try it on, do you?" Mr. Cheney replied, before walking over to a table of laser devices. Michael Cooper (NYT)
 
THE STATES
 
FISTICUFFS IN FLORIDA
Two Republican Florida legislators from feuding families traded punches early Wednesday morning after one's father reportedly insulted the other's father on live radio. The Miami Herald reported that State Representative Renier Diaz de la Portilla and Representative Carlos A. Lacasa, both of the Miami area, duked it out in the parking lot of Radio Mambi, a popular talk radio station, after Mr. Lacasa's father insulted Mr. Diaz de la Portilla's father on a talk show on primary election night. After the comments, Mr. Diaz de la Portilla went to the station and demanded to be let in to defend his family's honor, frightening Martha Flores, the radio host, who exclaimed into the microphone, "Hail Mary Mother of God, the Diaz de la Portillas are out there!" Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, Renier's brother, had just been badly beaten in his race for mayor of Miami-Dade County, and had complained that the radio was unfair to him in favor of his rival, Mayor Alex Penelas. Renier Diaz de la Portilla and Carlos Lacasa met in the parking lot and fought, although each says the other started it. Ms. Flores begged her listeners to call the police, and so many listeners responded that the flood of calls caused the 911 system to crash. Rick Bragg (NYT)
 
HAYDEN SEEKS CITY COUNCIL SEAT
Tom Hayden has spent close to 40 years rocking the political boat, first as a college student and later as a California assemblyman and senator. The state's term limits law is forcing him out of the Senate this year, but he is not giving up on public life. He announced yesterday that he would run for Los Angeles City Council next year, for a seat covering the Westside and parts of the San Fernando Valley that is being vacated by Mike Feuer. Mr. Hayden, a Democrat, joins a crowded field in the nonpartisan race. Todd S. Purdum (NYT)
 
THE CONVENTIONS
 
PHILADELPHIA'S RED SCARE
More than a month after the Republican convention ended, Philadelphia residents learned yesterday of the police department's rationale for a raid that resulted in 75 arrests at a warehouse where demonstrations were being planned. In a newly unsealed warrant, the police said some of the protesters had "communist and leftist" sponsors and others were sympathetic to "the former Soviet-allied World Federation of Trade Unions." Stefan Presser, legal director of the state American Civil Liberties Union, called the warrant an outrage today. "That document could have been written by Hoover's F.B.I. in the 40's and 50's," he said, complaining that it failed to justify the raid and served as a pretext for one of the largest instances of preventive detention in modern American history. Some of those arrested were kept in jail for more than two weeks after the convention and more than 300 cases are pending against demonstrators. The warrant also disclosed that the city police, who had been under court order not to infiltrate protest groups, used state troopers as infiltrators. Mr. Presser complained that the use of the troopers was "an end run" around basic civil liberties. The police declined to comment. Francis X. Clines (NYT)
 
THE REFORM PARTY
 
A VICTORY FOR HAGELIN
A Superior Court judge in Long Beach, Calif., declined yesterday to block John Hagelin, one of two men claiming to be the Reform Party presidential nominee, from campaigning under the party's banner. Supporters of the other claimant, Patrick J. Buchanan, had asked that the judge, James L. Wright, name him the true nominee and order Mr. Hagelin and his loyalists to halt their political activities. Judge Wright refused but said he was willing to hear further arguments on Wednesday. The Reform Party split at its convention in Long Beach last month, with the faction dominated by hard-right conservatives nominating Mr. Buchanan and the faction made up mainly of those advocating government reform nominating Mr. Hagelin.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
Bush Planning To See Voters, And to Be Seen

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush today dismissed criticism from some Republicans over the direction of his campaign. But he also called himself the underdog in the race and said he would restyle his campaign to include more intimate gatherings with voters.
Mr. Bush and his aides said he would start appearing at town hall meetings again as early as next week. Such sessions disappeared in March after Senator John McCain dropped from the Republican race. 
 Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, said the Texas governor was also likely to start dropping into coffee shops and cafeterias and might begin to visit families to discuss how his tax cut plan would affect them.
Asked why he wanted to hold such events, Mr. Bush said, "Well, it's a better picture." He said that if his unscripted encounters were mostly with reporters on his campaign plane, "people don't get a sense of my ability to relate to people. They don't get a sense that my plan has got real purposes for real people."
Ms. Hughes repeatedly used a similar phrase, "real plans for real people," making it clear that this was the Bush campaign's new slogan.
Mr. Bush made his comments at an impromptu news conference on an airport tarmac in Detroit after prominent Republicans across the country expressed concern over the state of his campaign and after a series of national and state polls showed that Vice President Al Gore was solidifying the gains he had made after the Democratic National Convention.
A poll released today by ABC News and The Washington Post found the race tied, with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore each attracting 47 percent. A Gallup Organization poll for CNN and USA Today found Mr. Gore leading Mr. Bush, 47 percent to 44 percent, a result that is also essentially a tie, since it is within the margin of error.
While Mr. Bush said today that he would change some campaign events, he also waved off some of the second-guessing. "That's Washington," he said. "That's people getting ready to jump out of the foxhole before the first shell is fired."
Mr. Bush used the military analogy on a day when he campaigned with two of the most prominent figures of his father's administration, Colin L. Powell, the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and J. Norman Schwarzkopf, who commanded United States troops during the Persian Gulf war of 1991.
Both voiced support for Mr. Bush's contention that President Clinton had allowed the military to deteriorate, leaving it unprepared for post-cold-war conflicts. And Mr. Powell called Mr. Bush "a man with a mission, a man with vision, a man who is committed to making sure the armed forces of the United States will always be the best."
Many of the Republicans who had voiced concerns about the shape of the Bush campaign seemed particularly concerned about Mr. Bush's refusal to agree to debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. They said his stance had made him seem timid and had taken him into an unproductive fight over political process rather than issues.
While he continued to criticize Mr. Gore for rejecting his offer for a different set of debates -- two of them shorter and to more limited audiences than the commission debates -- Mr. Bush for the first time gave some suggestion that there was give to his position. "There will be debates," he said. "I am confident there will be debates. As to what they look like and where they are, it will be worked out in due course."
Mr. Bush even joked that he "may go more alpha male coming down the stretch." That was a dig at Mr. Gore, who had a feminist author on his payroll last year, advising him how to dress and act like an alpha male. "I'm under no illusions and neither should our supporters be -- it's going to be a tough contest," Mr. Bush said.
Asked if he was the underdog, Mr. Bush jumped at the label. "Yeah," he said. "I'm the underdog. But I was the underdog when I first started."
Mr. Bush's new campaign style is reminiscent of the retooling of his primary campaign in South Carolina in February after his drubbing by Mr. McCain in New Hampshire. Mr. Bush began holding town meetings, which had been his opponent's trademark. And he tried to appropriate Mr. McCain's reform mantle, calling himself a "reformer with results."
The events Mr. Bush and his aides were describing today, similarly echoed of the style of Mr. Gore, who has been holding town hall meetings, visiting teachers in their homes and stopping into coffee shops to talk to workers. Mr. Gore often talks of fighting for "working people." Mr. Bush is now speaking of working for "real people."
Ms. Hughes said the governor and his aides had thought they were not being "creative" enough. She said the campaign had fallen into auto-pilot, simply using the rally formats that had worked so well for the governor on his ride into the Republican National Convention. She said Mr. Bush wanted to put a human face on his policy proposals by meeting with people and showing how they would benefit under his plans.
The Gore campaign derided Mr. Bush's portrayal of himself as an underdog.
"This is a guy who raised $100 million in this campaign, a record, from the special interests -- the H.M.O's, the prescription drug companies and the big oil industry," said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman. "It's Al Gore who has an agenda that represents the underdog and George W. Bush who has an agenda that represents the special interests."
Mr. Bush's new style was not visible today, however, as he turned to military themes and showcased at his side Mr. Powell and Mr. Schwarzkopf. At Wright University here, under a banner proclaiming "Respecting America's Military," Mr. Bush introduced the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Desert Storm commander, and each one gave him a strong endorsement as the best man to be commander in chief.
Mr. Bush also hinted at stops across the day that should he be elected, he would name Mr. Powell to his administration. "The general talked about being retired from public service," he said here, then glanced at Mr. Powell and added puckishly, "If all goes well. . . ." The crowd erupted in cheers and applause.
Mr. Bush pledged that he would push for modernization of the military to meet the new threats in the world.
And he said that the nation had the chance to "redefine how war is fought and won in the future, and therefore we have the opportunity to redefine how the peace is kept."
Mr. Bush said that if elected, he would assemble a task force of military leaders to come up with a "strategic plan" for what the military of the future should look like.
"We know it's not going to look like the great American moment of Desert Storm and Desert Shield," Mr. Bush said. "A military of the future is not going to be that heavy, and it's not going to be that hard to move."
Today's events were designed to put the gulf war leaders at center stage in order to endorse the son of the man they served under. General Schwarzkopf called himself proud to "stand up and endorse" Mr. Bush.
Mr. Powell lambasted the Clinton administration for hurting military readiness, a theme that Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney, who was defense secretary under President Bush, have been hitting hard.
"I was shocked and frankly deeply disappointed the other day when the president's spokesman attacked Dick Cheney because he dared to tell the truth about the state of readiness, and said he was attacking the military," Mr. Powell said. "Dick Cheney has never attacked the military."
Mr. Cheney pressed the same theme in appearances at military contractors in New England. He recalled a telephone call he had made to former President Ronald Reagan after the gulf war, saying he had thanked Mr. Reagan for the money his administration had spent on the military. "I ask myself," he said, "is anybody going to call Bill Clinton or Al Gore in the future to thank them for what they did to the U.S. military? I don't think so."
The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, challenged several of the assertions Governor Bush made in his speeches today. Mr. Bacon said that the administration, along with Congress, had increased military spending by $150 billion over the next several years. That included an increase in spending on weapons and other equipment -- an area where Mr. Bush was sharply critical -- from $43 billion in 1998 to $60 billion today, as well as three straight years of pay raises.
Mr. Bacon also noted that the number of troops qualifying for food stamps -- which Mr. Bush has often cited as evidence that the Clinton administration has neglected men and women in uniform -- had declined significantly.
Mr. Bacon said that 19,400 service members, nine-tenths of 1 percent of the total, collected food stamps in 1991, when Mr. Bush's father was president and his running mate, Mr. Cheney, was secretary of defense. Today, Mr. Bacon said, 5,100 are on food stamps, or four-tenths of 1 percent of a smaller force.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
A Tower With Housing And a Publishing House

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Reflecting the strong demand in Manhattan both for luxury housing and for new office space, the tower taking shape on the west side of Broadway from 55th to 56th Street will contain the new headquarters for Random House on its lower floors and be topped by 111 luxury condominium apartments.
Upon completion, which is expected in the summer of 2002, the building will be 630 feet high, about the same height as the 50-story office tower nearby at 9 West 57th Street. The new building's 26-story commercial component will house 650,000 square feet of offices for the publishing company, a division of Bertelsmann A.G., the German media giant. Bertelsmann will own that part of the tower, which will be called the Random House Building and have its entrance on Broadway. 
 The 23-story residential component, to be known as the Park Imperial, will have its entrance at 230 West 56th Street. Its one- to three-bedroom apartments, including five penthouses, will range from 811 to 2,975 square feet. All the units will have 10-foot-high ceilings and, since they start at 360 feet above street level, clear views of the Manhattan skyline, the Hudson River or Central Park.
The building is being marketed as a 70-story tower -- with the first residential floor labeled the 48th --based on the developer's calculation of the number of floors it would have if it were entirely residential. The Related Companies, which is developing the $425 million project, is not the first to take such an approach: Trump World Tower, near the United Nations, is billed as a 90-story building, although it has 72 floors.
At the Park Imperial, "the views became the keystone for our plans for the building," said David J. Wine, vice chairman of Related. Though the company is best known for rental housing, it chose to build condominiums on the West 56th Street site "because we knew people would be willing to pay a lot more money to own an apartment with those views than to rent one," Mr. Wine said.
Prices for the units are expected to be $575,000 to $4 million, or an average of $927 a square foot, said Louise Sunshine, president of the Sunshine Group, the project's sales agent.
According to preliminary figures for the second quarter from the Real Estate Board of New York, the median price for condominiums in the Midtown West neighborhood was $575 a square foot, up from $392 for the same period in 1999. At the high end, Ms. Sunshine said, prices go as high as $3,000 a square foot at the Trump International Hotel and Tower at 1 Central Park West.
The monthly common charges, including real estate taxes, at the Park Imperial are expected to be $725 to $2,720. The Park Imperial is eligible to receive a 10-year tax abatement from the city; without it, the charges would be $1,365 to $5,100 a month.
Related cannot sell the units until its offering plan is accepted for filing by the state attorney general's office; acceptance is expected by the end of this month. But since the Sunshine Group started marketing the units in August, 71 letters of intent have been received to buy specific apartments, Ms. Sunshine said.
Related assembled the Park Imperial site from 1997 through 1999, buying air rights from owners of adjacent structures at the same time. That allowed the company to increase the height of the building by 10 residential stories. The building is being constructed "as of right," meaning that no special permits or approvals were needed.
While Related decided early on to construct condominiums on the building's higher floors, Mr. Wine said, "the strength of New York's economy gave us many options for the lower portion," including hotel rooms, rental apartments or offices.
Ultimately, "the prestige and financial strength of Random House persuaded us that office use was the best way to go," Mr. Wine said. He added that the mix of uses was ideal for the neighborhood, given the emergence of Broadway in the 40's and 50's as an entertainment, media and corporate corridor.
Because of the Park Imperial's location, Ms. Sunshine said, the apartments have drawn interest from the buyers for whom it was intended: empty-nesters and professional singles and couples. She said there was also strong interest from foreign buyers.
The developers say that in addition to its views, the Park Imperial's contemporary style will help distinguish it from the crop of condominiums, many designed to resemble prewar buildings, being built for prosperous buyers. The building's facade, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, will be clad in a reflective glass curtain wall. It will have a rectangular base and will be topped by a setback residential tower with a sawtoothed silhouette.
Because of the eight-cornered shape of the tower, the apartments, designed by Ismael Leyva, a Manhattan architect, will lend themselves to distinctive layouts. Along with high ceilings, all the units will have galleries and central foyers and most will have at least two corner glass walls.
Related has also hired the interior designer Adam D. Tihany, whose work includes Le Cirque 2000, to design the building's lobby, which will feature curved wood walls, a frosted bronze mirror and a terrazzo floor with onyx inlays. Mr. Tihany is also designing the Imperial Club, a business, entertainment and fitness center for residents. Other planned amenities include valet service and garage parking for 100 cars.

Dance Group Gets Grant

BYLINE: By Terry Pristin 

 BODY:
The Dance Theater of Harlem will receive a $2.3 million matching grant to help it pay off its debts, strengthen its management structure and perform more frequently in Harlem, officials announced yesterday.
The money was awarded to the struggling 31-year-old ballet company on Aug. 21 by the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, a federal, state and city program devised to stimulate economic development. Under the terms of the grant, the dance company will be required to raise $5.7 million on its own to receive the $2.3 million, said Terry C. Lane, the president of the Empowerment Zone. 
 The Dance Theater's season at City Center began on Wednesday and will end on Sept. 17. Mr. Mitchell said that the grant would enable the company to perform more frequently at the Aaron Davis Hall and other sites in Harlem. Terry Pristin (NYT)

HEADLINE: Schools Try To Smooth The Bumps On Day 1

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
As Harold O. Levy, the freshman chancellor, arrived at Central Park East, a public elementary school in East Harlem, on the first leg of a back-to-school tour, he was startled yesterday morning to find the school's administrator mopping up spilled coffee in a cafeteria swirling with excited children and their anxious parents.
"The first thing I thought was, this is a custodian I could love," Mr. Levy said. 
 The administrator, Bruce R. Kanze, shrugged off the mistaken identity. "If there's a spill in the cafeteria, I'm going to mop it up," he said later. "It's just a reflex."
Yesterday was a day for mopping up spills large and small, as 1.1 million New York City schoolchildren began classes, from prekindergarten to high school, after the summer.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mr. Levy, in a ceremonial joint visit to a school in Queens, hailed the opening as smooth and untroubled. And it was true: the day seemed unmarred by the kind of crises -- from asbestos contamination to overcrowding -- that have become as much a back-to-school ritual as new book bags and the right hairstyle.
But across the city, principals, parents and teachers coped with the kinds of opening-day disruptions and disappointments -- classes in trailers, inexperienced teachers, a false bomb scare in a Bronx school -- that have become almost institutionalized in many public schools.
At Central Park East, Adrienne Mason, the mother of a second grader, was alarmed to see the chancellor, thinking that it was better for the school she loved to be left alone by the central bureaucracy.
"The Board of Education has a policy," Ms. Mason, a health care marketer, candidly told the chancellor, buttonholing him in the hallway. It destroys anything that works, she said.
One shadow was lifted yesterday when Mr. Levy said he was ending a hiring freeze that prevented the more successful schools from hiring the certified teachers they wanted. Mr. Levy said that the board had complied with a court order requiring it to hire certified teachers for vacancies in the worst elementary schools. Some vacancies, he said, may remain in middle and high schools.
The need for qualified teachers is particularly acute this year because children face new Regents mathematics examinations this year, in addition to the one-year-old English examinations, as a requirement for graduating from high school. The system must also show that it can help more than 20,000 students who were held back at the end of this summer, under a tough new policy to end social promotion.
"This year's asbestos crisis is personnel," said Noreen Connell, executive director of the Educational Priorities Panel, a nonprofit group that monitors city schools. "There is a shortage of good teachers, and this is a good economy. Many of them can walk with their feet, going to easier, higher-paying jobs in the suburbs."
Among districts with opening day problems was Washington Heights in Manhattan, where Dominican immigration has swelled enrollment. At P.S. 192, elementary school classes were going smoothly, but more than 300 middle-school students waited nearly two hours in a cramped auditorium for buses to take them across town because their local schools could not accommodate them.
As distraught and angry mothers waited outside, some ducking into nearby bodegas to buy orange juice for their captive children, district officials said the charter company that ran the buses was late, but they could not explain why.
At P.S. 25 in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, one of the city's lowest-performing schools, a small group of parents complained that the new principal, Leroy Johnson, had previously presided over a school that had been forced to close because of poor performance, Intermediate School 74 in the Bronx.
Irwin Kurz, instructional superintendent for the Chancellor's District for troubled schools, said Mr. Johnson had a history as a trouble-shooter and had been hired to turn P.S. 25 around with the help of 13 teaching fellows -- teachers recruited from other professions this year through a program established by Mr. Levy.
In Queens, 80 children who had failed eighth grade, under the new policy on social promotion, were quarantined in trailers behind an elementary school, P.S. 100 in Ozone Park. There they became instant pariahs -- resented by parents at the elementary school, surrounded by security guards and forbidden to enter the main school building, even to eat lunch.
Matthew Bromme, the district superintendent, said that the 80 students were part of the Eight-Plus program established by the board as a transition between middle school and high school, and that they would move on by February.
In Manhattan, middle-class parents at successful yet fragile schools, like Middle School 54 and P.S. 163, both on the Upper West Side, worried that their best teachers were being reshuffled to failing schools in the Bronx and Brooklyn, robbing Peter to pay Paul, under the court order agreed to by the state, the city and the teachers' union.
Although Mr. Levy, now entering contract negotiations with teachers, has made hiring and keeping qualified teachers a theme of his new administration, the city has not been able to meet its goal of hiring only certified teachers throughout the system. The teachers' union reported yesterday that of the teachers hired this fall, 4,100 were certified, and 2,500 were uncertified. That is in a system where about 15 percent of all teachers are uncertified, and more in the most troubled schools.
Randi Weingarten, president of the union, the United Federation of Teachers, said that she had met with 800 teacher leaders yesterday and heard many accounts of budget reductions that had forced high schools to cut back on teaching positions.
Board officials said they could not confirm the union's figures on uncertified teachers. They added that additional money had been allocated to high schools over the last two weeks.
Several principals said that the school system was being overly dogmatic in its push to hire certified teachers, a position that Mr. Levy has hinted he agrees with.
At Central Park East, Mr. Levy waxed a bit rhapsodic, but steered clear of any grand claims for the day, perhaps realizing that they might come back to haunt him. "What I'm satisfied with is that there are 78,000 teachers doing God's work," he said before moving on to three other schools in three other boroughs. "We should celebrate the fact that schools are opening. School opening is a new beginning."

HEADLINE: Should a Fetus's Well-Being Override a Mother's Rights?

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The war on drugs arrived with a vengeance in the obstetrics department of the Medical University of South Carolina in the fall of 1989. Distressed by evidence of increasing cocaine use by women receiving prenatal care at the university's public hospital in Charleston, and fearing for the fate of abandoned or impaired crack babies, the staff began testing the urine of patients who aroused their suspicions. Positive test results were turned over to the local prosecutor and the police, and women were arrested on the spot, sometimes at the hospital just after giving birth.
The acute concerns that led to such a punitive approach have eased since then, as cocaine use has dwindled and the worst fears for a generation of crack babies have proved unfounded. Challenged in court and criticized by medical organizations for criminalizing a public health problem, the policy evolved into a statewide program that emphasizes treatment rather than punishment for pregnant drug abusers. 
 But the issues raised by the Charleston experience reverberate still -- and far beyond the confines of a Supreme Court case, to be argued on Oct. 4, on whether the warrantless drug tests amounted to unconstitutional searches. The case, Ferguson v. City of Charleston, is one of the most closely watched of the court's new term. But however the justices rule, the Fourth Amendment, with its prohibition against unreasonable searches, cannot provide an answer to the deeper questions raised by what happened in Charleston and what is happening in various contexts across the country.
When does a pregnant woman -- or even a potentially pregnant woman, given increasing medical knowledge about reproductive health -- cross the line between autonomy and obligation? In an age of reproductive freedom, when no woman has to carry a pregnancy to term, when if ever should society intervene to protect the future interests of a child whom a woman has chosen to bear?
If fetal health is the issue, what about a pregnant woman who smokes two packs of cigarettes a day, or who abuses alcohol, given that the American Medical Association has identified fetal alcohol syndrome as "the leading cause of mental retardation in the western world"? And fundamentally, whose interest is it, anyway?
Some 200 women in 30 states have been prosecuted on various legal theories of "fetal abuse." A woman in Georgia was charged last year with capital murder for the death, moments after birth, of one of a pair of premature twins; the mother, who tested positive for cocaine and methamphetamine, had received no prenatal care. Her lawyers are seeking dismissal of the charges.
The troubling scenarios are extremely diverse, extending far beyond criminal law. Women have been forced to undergo Caesarean sections when doctors have convinced judges or hospital committees that the patient's refusal of surgical intervention was ill advised, and medical ethicists are debating the implications of fetal surgery that can correct some serious problems before birth but that some women are likely to reject.
Last week a state juvenile court judge in Massachusetts ordered a pregnant member of a fundamentalist sect to be taken into custody and held until she gives birth several weeks from now. The sect rejects modern medical care, and a baby born to the woman last year died five minutes after birth.
A decade ago, declaring that women "may not be forced to choose between having a child and having a job," the Supreme Court invalidated the "fetal protection" policies that employers were using to bar pregnant or potentially pregnant women from workplaces with toxins or other known hazards to fetal development. The decision, one of the court's more important sex discrimination rulings of the 1990's, settled the legal question. But it could hardly resolve the personal dilemma facing a woman whose need to earn a living may risk the health of the child she hopes to have.
Dawn Johnsen, a law professor at Indiana University who formerly served as legal director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said that those cases needed to be seen in the "broader context of women's equality and liberty rights." "Whenever the law uses the fact that a woman is pregnant to treat her differently, it's important to be suspicious," she said, given the history of using women's fertility as a reason for excluding them from economic and civic life.
While the language of rights in conflict -- "maternal rights" versus "fetal rights" -- pervades much of the discussion, this, in the view of many people, is a misleading way to frame the question.
It is a misperceived conflict and a "false dichotomy," said Rachel Roth, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis and the author of "Making Women Pay: The Hidden Costs of Fetal Rights." The book argues that a result of emphasizing the ways in which women fail their fetuses has been to take society off the hook for providing better medical care, drug treatment and safer workplaces, and to "privatize responsibility for the next generation."
The focus on the fetus, Ms. Roth maintains in her book, "reduces women to incubators" who are seen not as "full-fledged human beings, but merely better or worse vessels for fetuses," their bodies no longer seen as nurturing sanctuaries but "as a form of solitary confinement for the fetus."
In an interview, Ms. Roth said that the Charleston experience was an example of "the personification of the fetus at women's expense." She said that while the policy "was supposed to be for the fetus's benefit, arresting the woman after delivery doesn't improve life for the baby or the woman."
Any emphasis on the fetus as a focus of public policy makes supporters of abortion rights nervous. Yet the question of harmful behavior during pregnancy is logically quite separate from the abortion debate, according to John Robertson, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Texas.
While it is clear from the Supreme Court's precedents that "fetuses don't have rights as such to be born," Mr. Robertson said in an interview, that is hardly the end of the discussion. The "real party in interest," he said, is neither the woman nor the fetus, but "the child who will be born" and who will be affected, after birth, by the prenatal behavior. "A pregnant woman, if she chooses not to end the pregnancy, takes on a moral and perhaps a legal obligation to refrain from clearly harmful prenatal conduct," he said.
But even someone whose ethical stance favors intervention sees no clear answers when it comes to applying principle to policy. Charleston "went overboard" in its original, punitive approach, Mr. Robertson said: "As a matter of principle, I don't see why the state should be prevented from taking action. As a policy judgment, it might be another matter."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN NEW YORK;
In Statement By the U.N.: The Need For Balance

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the United Nations Millennium Declaration from the General Assembly:
We believe that the central challenge we face today is to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world's people. For while globalization offers great opportunities, at present its benefits are very unevenly shared, while its costs are unevenly distributed. 
 We recognize that developing countries and countries with economies in transition face special difficulties in responding to this central challenge.
Thus, only through broad and sustained efforts to create a shared future, based upon our common humanity in all its diversity, can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable. These efforts must include policies and measures, at the global level, which correspond to the needs of developing countries and economies in transition, and are formulated and implemented with their effective participation.
We consider certain fundamental values to be essential to international relations in the 21st century. These include:
FREEDOM -- Men and women have the right to live their lives and raise their children in dignity, free from hunger and from the fear of violence, oppression or injustice. Democratic and participatory governance based on the will of the people best assures these rights.
EQUALITY -- No individual and no nation must be denied the opportunity to benefit from development. The equal rights and opportunities of women and men must be assured.
SOLIDARITY -- Global challenges must be managed in a way that distributes the costs and burdens fairly in accordance with basic principles of equity and social justice. Those who suffer, or who benefit least, deserve help from those who benefit most.
TOLERANCE -- Human beings must respect each other, in all their diversity of belief, culture and language. Differences within and between societies should neither be feared nor repressed, but cherished as a precious asset of humanity. A culture of peace and dialogue among all civilizations should be actively promoted.
RESPECT FOR NATURE -- Prudence must be shown in the management of all living species and natural resources, in accordance with the precepts of sustainable development. Only in this way can the immeasurable riches provided to us by nature be preserved and passed on to our descendants. The current unsustainable patterns of production and consumption must be changed, in the interest of our future welfare and that of our descendants.
SHARED RESPONSIBILITY -- Responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social development, as well as threats to international peace and security, must be shared among the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally. As the most universal and most representative organization in the word, the United Nations must play the central role. . . .
We resolve further:
*To halve, by the year 2015, the proportion of the world's people whose income is less than $1 a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger; and also, by the same date, to halve the proportion of people who are unable to reach, or to afford, safe drinking water.
*To ensure that, by the same date, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling; and that girls and boys will have equal access to all levels of education.
*By the same date, to have reduced maternal mortality by three-quarters, and under-5 child mortality by two-thirds, of their current rates.
*To have by then halted -- and begun to reverse -- the spread of H.I.V./AIDS, the scourge of malaria and other major diseases that afflict humanity.
*To provide special assistance to children orphaned by H.I.V./AIDS.
*By 2020, to have achieved a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers as proposed in the "Cities Without Slums" initiative.
We also resolve:
*To promote gender equality and the empowerment of women, as effective ways to combat poverty, hunger and disease and to stimulate development that is truly sustainable.
*To develop and implement strategies that give young people everywhere a real chance to find decent and productive work.
*To encourage the pharmaceutical industry to make essential drugs more widely available and affordable by all who need them in developing countries.
*To develop strong partnerships with the private sector, and with civil society organizations, in pursuit of development and poverty eradication.

HEADLINE: Politics Without Piety

BYLINE: By Geoffrey Wheatcroft; Geoffrey Wheatcroft is the author of "The Controversy of Zion: Jewish Nationalism, the Jewish State and the Unresolved Jewish Dilemma."

DATELINE: BATH, England

 BODY:
Across the Atlantic, the role of religion in the American presidential race has been followed with a mixture of interest and polite puzzlement. What Europeans find so striking is not that there is a Jewish vice presidential candidate, but that Joseph Lieberman wears his piety on his sleeve, just like other American politicians of recent years.
Nothing so vividly illustrates the gulf between America and Europe. After all, a Jewish leader is not new for Europe. France had a Jewish prime minister in 1936, England in 1868, and Spain, of all countries, in 1835, but none of them -- Leon Blum, Benjamin Disraeli or Juan Alvarez Mendizabal -- were devoutly observant, as Mr. Lieberman is. Indeed, Disraeli had been baptized as an Episcopalian, just like Barry Goldwater. 
 Europe is the cradle of institutional Christianity, but today, institutional religion in Europe is on the point of collapse. Fewer than one French person in 10 goes to church even once a year, and the Roman Catholic church has never been less influential in the life of the nation.
In my country, we have a Church of England "by law established," with the queen as its supreme governor. And its services are now regularly attended by a mere 2 percent of the population. So it goes across Europe; the collapse of organized Christianity, for better or worse, can be seen from Ireland to Italy.
Of the advanced industrial world, only in the United States does religion thrive. Polls have shown that a remarkable 40 percent of Americans claim to worship in various churches, synagogues and mosques.
This gulf is reflected in politics on either side of the Atlantic. European politicians invoke God rarely if at all, and not many of them even pretend to be personally devout. Tony Blair is a pious High Episcopalian who often goes to Mass with his Catholic wife, but he is an exception. Indeed, only a minority of British prime ministers in the 20th century could be called Christians in any serious sense. Winston Churchill, for example, went to church on formal occasions, but was privately agnostic.
Even in the days when European statesmen were more often privately inspired by faith, as Gladstone and Bismarck were in their different ways, they did not parade their religious devotion, as this year's presidential candidates have all felt obliged to do. The only one who didn't was Bill Bradley, and look where it got him.
There was a time when an American politician could have publicly echoed the Italian nationalist Cavour's phrase about "a free church in a free state." He might even have privately agreed with H. L. Mencken that you respect the other guy's religious faith in the way you respect his belief that his wife is beautiful and his kids are smart.
No longer. Today, Mr. Lieberman continually calls on the Almighty and asserts that religion is the only true basis for morality, a claim that makes us very uneasy here. George W. Bush excites derision among English commentators when he says God is his favorite philosopher, and so does Al Gore when he says he asks himself, "What would Jesus do?"
What indeed? What would Jesus do about the budget surplus, China trade or Sierra Leone? The gospels provide remarkably little guidance about practical conduct, certainly not in military or economic matters.
No doubt European bafflement at American religiosity has overtones of condescension toward American cultural "backwardness," a condescension that often thinly conceals envy and resentment. But in this case, the cynical Old World may have a point.
Instead of preaching, Mr. Lieberman could simply say, "I take my religion from the Torah and my politics from America." He could recognize that plenty of unbelievers lead highly moral lives and that some religious people don't. He might reflect on what his people went through in vehemently religious societies. He might note that his political career, like those of Disraeli and Blum, has benefited from the defeat of political sectarianism.
And instead of saying that "I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing because I believe it's the American way," he could acknowledge that the free exercise of religion is truly part of the American way -- and one of the blessings of a free, open and secular society.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES;
Oil Slips From 10-Year Peak As Saudis Talk of More Output

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Crude oil fell for the first time in five sessions yesterday, retreating from a 10-year high, after Saudi Arabia signaled that OPEC would agree to expand production to trim prices at a meeting this weekend in Vienna.
Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, said Saudi Arabia wanted to bring prices down to $22 to $28 a barrel for the group's oil benchmark -- the price was $33.84 yesterday. OPEC is expected to increase daily supplies 500,000 to 800,000 barrels, or about 2 percent of its output, in an attempt to reverse a 24 percent rally since the end of July. 
 "The market is starting to embrace a rise of 700,000 barrels coming out of the meeting," said William Brown, president of W. H. Brown & Company, an oil market consulting firm in New York.
Crude oil for October delivery fell $1.76, or 5.0 percent, to $33.63 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the biggest one-day drop since April 10, when OPEC was preparing a previous output increase. Prices yesterday reached $35.46 a barrel, the highest level since the Persian Gulf war in November 1990.
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said today that he was concerned that rising oil prices could lead to recessions that would hurt all countries, including the oil exporters.
Nations in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries want the governments of oil-importing countries to cut taxes to lower the burden of rising energy costs on consumers, Mr. Naimi said. In some European nations, taxes represent almost three-fourths of the cost of gasoline at the pump.
"OPEC will do its part to lower the crude price within the target band," he said. "We hope the consuming countries will do their part to lower the product price."
Oil prices that are close to the highest in a decade and steep government fuel taxes have produced protests in Europe. In France, truckers calling for a cut in fuel levies blockaded oil depots for a sixth day yesterday, causing many service stations to run out of gasoline.
Travelers can expect to see higher air fares because of fuel costs. Yesterday, Continental Airlines Inc., the fifth-largest United States carrier, announced a $20 fuel surcharge on round-trip domestic air travel, after a 27 percent increase in jet fuel prices in the past month.
Winning support for an increase of more than 500,000 barrels a day -- less than 1 percent of world output -- from other members of the 11-nation group may be difficult for the Saudis. The Kuwaiti oil minister, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah, said that oil markets were adequately supplied and that the nation would back a "marginal" change of about 500,000 barrels a day, the official KUNA news agency said.
Iran, OPEC's second-biggest oil producer, said it would support an increase in production although the country favored increasing output by less than 700,000 barrels, The Financial Times reported.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
In a Style Change, Bush Talks More Directly to the Voters

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Mo., Sept. 8

 BODY:
First thing this morning, Gov. George W. Bush stared out at a group of workers and said, "I have a confession to make. I'm here to ask for your vote."
He described how he had run for Congress from Texas in 1978 and "came in second in a two-person race." A woman came up to him in his hometown afterwards and told him she had not voted for him. "And I said, 'Well, why not?' " Mr. Bush recalled, "and she said, 'Because you didn't bother to ask for my vote.' " 
 So today George Bush was asking.
It was the debut of the more accessible style that the governor had promised as a way of addressing concerns among prominent Republicans and even some of his own aides that his campaign was slipping in the polls. For the first time since the Republican primaries, Mr. Bush held a sustained question and answer session with voters, running longer than some recent campaign events.
At the same time the Republican National Committee unveiled its strongest commercial yet against Vice President Al Gore in a drive to make voters doubt the Democrat's credibility.
In the commercial a woman announcer speaks of Mr. Gore's pledge to overhaul the nation's campaign finance system and then runs through a litany of the indictments and unanswered Congressional subpoenas resulting from the campaign finance abuses of 1996 when the Democratic National Committee returned several million dollars in contributions because of questions about the money's origins.
"Al Gore's promising campaign finance reform," the announcer says. "Can I believe him? Because of Gore's last fund-raising campaign, 22 people have been indicted, 12 convicted, 70 took the Fifth Amendment, and 18 witnesses fled the country." The advertisement then goes on to cast doubt on Mr. Gore's proposals for school accountability and ends, "Just more politics from Al Gore."
The juxtaposition of Mr. Bush's new style and the advertisement showed how the campaign is seeking to move ahead: plant questions about Mr. Gore's credibility and the validity of his promises and then showcase Mr. Bush in informal settings open and accessible and speaking of "real plans for real people."
Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, said of the commercial: "I think it highlights a fundamental question of the election and that is: if you can't trust the vice president's credibility on an issue like campaign finance reform, how you can trust his credibility on an issue like education reform?"
Mr. Bush's visit to the Marconi Communications company, about a half-hour's drive outside Pittsburgh, had been planned as a venue for Mr. Bush to speak in a swing state about his plan to divert some of the Social Security payroll tax into private investment accounts as a way to refashion the program for the retirement of the baby boom generation.
"Instead of being a retirement system gone bust, it's a retirement system that's robust," he rhymed.
In keeping with his decision to get closer to the people, Mr. Bush headed quickly to the company cafeteria, where he bought a cup of coffee and began greeting employees who applauded him from their tables. And after his prepared remarks to a group of employees, he took an array of questions, talking of his relations with the news media and with Democrats, his efforts to give the golden cheek warbler a place to nest on his Texas ranch, his tax policy and plans for education.
His first questioner was almost inaudible, but it was clear that he did not think that journalists portrayed Mr. Bush fairly.
"I respect the media," Mr. Bush replied, but then he suggested that he would not dare say otherwise, noting, "Of course, it's about 60 days before the election."
"I do" respect the news media, he emphasized. "I think it's been fair to me. But the best way for me to get my message out is to speak directly to the people."
When another man wanted to know about Mr. Bush's relations with Democrats, he spoke about working with Bob Bullock, the late Democratic lieutenant governor of Texas.
"We had a rocky relationship at times, but let me tell you how it ended," Mr. Bush said. He said he had gone on his very first campaign trip to Iowa and New Hampshire, "and I came back and this good man was on his death bed and he asked me to eulogize him at his funeral. It was one of the most touching moments I've had in my life, frankly."
Mr. Bush talked at length, gesturing emphatically, about his ideas to bring more testing and accountability in schools. "It's kind of a long-winded answer," he said, "but it's my passion. Thanks for the question."
By the time it was over, his audience had also learned that he is keeping a grove of cedars standing on his ranch because the golden cheek warbler nests in them -- though he said he would not want the federal government ordering such environmental steps by fiat. And he also told of his commitment to tax cutting in good times and bad.
"If we ever went into a recession -- which I certainly hope we do not do and I don't think we will -- I'm going to increase the pace of tax relief," Mr. Bush said. "The best way to grow out of a recession is to accelerate tax relief to people."
Later, Mr. Bush announced that he had won the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, and held an airport rally, opposing Mr. Gore's populist cry that the vice president is "for the people, not for the powerful" with some populism of his own. Mr. Bush showcased people who would get substantial tax cuts under his plan to cut taxes by $1.3 trillion, but little under Mr. Gore's tax cut plan.
"Now you tell me, Who's standing on the side of the people?" Mr. Bush said. "You tell me, Whose plan is a real plan with real solutions? It's our plan. It's our plan."

HEADLINE: Jesse Jackson Confronts Leader Of Peru Over Prisoner's Case

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
The Rev. Jesse Jackson said yesterday that he intended to go to Peru to meet with Lori Berenson, a New Yorker who has been imprisoned on charges of treason for more than five years, and to negotiate with the Peruvian authorities for her release.
Ms. Berenson's life sentence for treason and terrorism, handed down in a military court there, was overturned last month. A new trial in civilian court is planned. 
 Mr. Jackson made what he called a mercy plea for Ms. Berenson's release in front of a surprised President Alberto Fujimori of Peru at a Midtown Manhattan luncheon, at which Mr. Fujimori tried to review his nation's economic and social progress before a gathering of New York investors and bankers.
Mr. Jackson called on Mr. Fujimori, who stood stone-faced on the podium, to consider the years that Ms. Berenson has already spent in prison as time served and to release her immediately. He told Mr. Fujimori that doing so "would be a smart thing to do," and that it would represent "no threat to your sovereignty."
Mr. Fujimori said that the judicial branch of the government would handle the trial, "not the executive."
Then he left open the possibility of a visit by Mr. Jackson. "Of course we are always willing to dialogue," Mr. Fujimori said, adding that the discussions could continue when Mr. Jackson was in Peru.
Mark L. Berenson, the imprisoned woman's father, said in a telephone interview that he had met Mr. Jackson last week in Chicago after appearing on the Oprah Winfrey program to talk about the new trial.
"It's uplifting to us and to many Americans who have seen how Reverend Jackson has worked for the release of prisoners in Liberia, Kosovo, Cuba, Saudi Arabia and Iraq," he said. "We're pleased that in the name of humanity, justice and dignity he's doing the same now."
Mr. Jackson has spoken publicly about Ms. Berenson's case several times since meeting Mr. Berenson in Chicago. But during the confrontation with Mr. Fujimori yesterday, at the St. Regis Hotel, Mr. Jackson made it clear for the first time that he planned to intervene directly.
It was unusual for Mr. Jackson to put a foreign leader on the spot so publicly. He said later that he wanted to link the issues of human rights with the kind of economic performance that Mr. Fujimori had been so eager to discuss at the event.
"Economic growth without human rights is like a bucket with a hole in it," Mr. Jackson said. All of Mr. Fujimori's attempts to bring attention to any improvements in his country's economic or social situation will be ignored, he said, until Ms. Berenson is released.
"You can't hear any of what he's saying as long as Lori's in jail," Mr. Jackson said.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN NEW YORK: THE OVERVIEW;
U.N. MEETING ENDS WITH DECLARATION OF COMMON VALUES

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Three days of brainstorming by the leaders of virtually all the world's nations ended tonight with a brave attempt to agree on a set of goals for the next millennium, and common values by which to govern.
It was not easy, but more than 150 leaders and few stand-ins tried to mesh the demands for universal democracy, the rule of law and human rights, including the equality of women -- all important to the developed world -- with demands by poor nations for better balance in the world's economy and more benefits from the rise of globalization. 
 "We will spare no effort to make the United Nations a more effective instrument for pursuing all of these priorities," a declaration issued today said. "The fight for development for all the peoples of the world; the fight against ignorance, poverty and disease; the fight against injustice; the fight against violence, terror and crime; and the fight against the degradation and destruction of our common home."
Few would expect the eight pages of ambitious pledges to be fulfilled, any more than citizens of any one country would believe the same promises from politicians. But the endorsement could not come from any higher authorities.
"This has been the mother of all summits," Kishore Mahbubani, Singapore's representative at the United Nations, said. "It also confirmed that the U.N. provides the only viable setting to develop a village council for a global village."
Stripped of the ceremony usually associated with events like this, the largest gathering of leaders ever held had in the end turned into an impromptu forum for examining the performance of the United Nations.
There were many who felt that the organization could be doing more to help the poor and keep the peace.
The final round of speeches was its own corrective, illustrating the passions that still run high on both sides of the divide between the north and south, the rich and poor. President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe was the most blunt.
"If the new millennium, like the last," Mr. Mugabe said, "remains an age of hegemonic empires and conquerors doing the same old things in new technological ways, remains the age of the master race, the master economy and the master state, then I am afraid we in developing countries will have to stand up as a matter of principle and say, 'Not again.' "
President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, taking a more optimistic line, said he thought that a lot of listening was going on and that the sheer number of government leaders gave the meeting "the sort of weight that it needs."
"Because of that kind of participation," Mr. Mbeki said in an interview, "it becomes possible to say what are the matters around which there is consensus in the world." He sees agreement that all nations have to deal with the challenge of world poverty and an understanding "that in fact the resources and the means are there within the world economy to deal with this matter."
"I think that's a very important conclusion, because it gives the possibility to say what is the next step we then take," he added.
That step, he said, is to reform the major international institutions like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations and the World Trade Organization.
"Some people might say this is cynical," Mr. Mbeki said. "But if you look at the almost 60 Chinese whose bodies are found in the port of Dover in England, they traveled all the way from China, pushed out of China by poverty. So you can't sit in the United Kingdom and say we're insulated from poverty in China because it's far away. When those bodies land at the doorstep, then you know that you actually are not insulated from that poverty."
In a week of meetings that brought together not only political leaders, but also corporate executives, religious figures and all varieties of protestors, many more events were outside the General Assembly hall than in it. At roundtables, government leaders exchanged ideas more informally than in set speeches.
Secretary General Kofi Annan met dozens of leaders privately to discuss situations confronting the United Nations around the world. At least 185 meetings between government leaders took place at United Nations headquarters, to add to the dozens of others held in hotels and diplomatic missions around New York.
About 85 nations signed or ratified a total of nearly 300 treaties and conventions. The most attention was given to two conventions, one that bars children younger than 18 from participation in armed conflict and the other a prohibition on the sale or use of children, particularly for sex or pornography.
A memorial to child soldiers killed, wounded, missing or taken prisoner of war on several continents was announced at Unicef, the United Nations children's fund. An aluminum slab inscribed with the names of scores of children, the memorial will travel around the United States to spread awareness of the more than 300,000 children thought to be fighting in wars in 30 countries. Many are forcibly conscripted or abducted by rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka and several groups in Colombia.
Inside the iron fence that separated the people riding in limousines from the ones who were swamped by the traffic jams that the motorcades left in their wakes, the United Nations headquarters groaned a little, too. A 50's-era building with vintage elevators and escalators designed for 51 member nations whose leaders did not travel with small armies, the complex is under increasing strain, now with 189 member nations. It was 188 until this week, when the flag of Tuvalu (population 10,000) was raised.
New York will have a chance on Sunday to bask in some gratitude for shouldering the inconvenience and expense of security, blocked intersections, intrusive motorcades and booked-up restaurants caused by all of the high-level caucusing. Windows on both sides of the Secretariat Building, the glass box on the East River, will be lighted to spell out, "Thank you, N.Y." Mr. Annan, who must not have left the building very often, thanked New Yorkers today for their "courtesy, understanding and support."
A spokesman for the meeting, Therese Gasteau, said today that 8,000 delegates and 5,500 journalists swelled the ranks of 4,500 Secretariat employees who run the United Nations. The final tally of leaders included 100 presidents or other heads of state, including the president of Switzerland, which is not a United Nations member; 47 other government leaders; 3 crown princes; and a few vice presidents, deputy prime ministers and some "high ranking officials," a category that included Yasir Arafat.
United Nations officials, especially the protocol and security staffs, have abundant experience handling plumed personalities and ruffled feathers, so there were no major diplomatic incidents that anyone could think of today. There was only that glitch in the group picture, which showed a few more faces than expected. Most of them were quickly identified as invited extras. But one, at first known officially as "the interloper," was not. Fred Eckhard, Mr. Annan's spokesman, spoke today of a diplomatic decision not to put a name to the face, but the man in the upper left corner was Count Carlo Marullo di Condojanni, of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which is not a member of the United Nations..
Outside a church in Harlem on Thursday night, Mr. Mugabe was served with papers from a suit in federal District Court in Manhattan that complains of widespread abuse of power before parliamentary elections this year in Zimbabwe. The lead plaintiff, Adella Chiminya Tachiona, says in the suit that her husband, Tapfuma, was killed on April 15 by members of Mr. Mugabe's governing party under his direction, according to Theodore M. Cooperstein, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.
While leaders dined in hotel suites, ballrooms and banquet rooms, many others, from United Nations officials to New York City police officers, headed for the United Nations cafeteria.
The run on the cafeteria meant long days for Michael Friend, who manages most of the building's eating and drinking places. He and his cooks had to show up by 4 a.m. to fire up the breakfast grills, squeeze the oranges and prepare for the daily attack on the espresso corner.
At the sandwich counter, Elaine Rivas and Nicky Glasgow said they were making 500 sandwiches a day instead of the usual 200. The summit meeting ate its way through 3,000 pounds of chicken, 2,000 pounds of beef, 300 pounds of pasta and 100 gallons of tomato sauce.
Mr. Friend took a philosophical approach. "I think of those people in their offices moving a pile of papers from one box to another," he said of the work going on upstairs. "What do they have to show for it? Here people are happy. People are fed."

HEADLINE: Modern-Day Slavery

 BODY:
By a conservative estimate, there are 27 million people working under various forms of slavery in the world today, and the number is growing. In contrast to the slavery America knew, today's slaveholders mainly exploit people of their own race. But as in the American past, they use violence and threats to force people to labor for no pay. Slavery is illegal everywhere, but it thrives because of the corruption of police and government authorities. Many people are unaware that modern slavery exists.
People held in some form of bondage pick sugar cane in the Dominican Republic, make the charcoal used in Brazil's steel industry and work as prostitutes in Thailand. In Mauritania and Sudan blacks are forced into domestic and agricultural slavery in Muslim households. Similar forms of oppression are not unknown in developed nations. The Central Intelligence Agency estimates that 45,000 women and children are smuggled into the United States each year with false promises of decent jobs. Instead, most find that their passports are stolen and they are forced to work as prostitutes or maids, on farms or in sweatshops. 
 But the majority of people who are treated like slaves, perhaps 20 million, according to the United Nations, are South Asians in debt bondage. The system is chillingly described in "Disposable People," a survey of contemporary forms of slavery by Kevin Bales, who teaches at the University of Surrey in England. Whole families, including children, are trapped into peonage to pay debts incurred by medical expenses, a funeral or crop failure. Their debts are inflated by outrageous prices for food and usurious interest rates. Families can essentially be enslaved for generations.
Slavery and related kinds of servitude are a growing business because the number of desperately poor people is increasing and globalization has disrupted rural communities. In many nations, children, mainly girls, must drop out of school to work. A girl in a northern Thai village can be sold into prostitution for $2,000 -- a huge sum there. A Thai survey found that many families knowingly sold daughters into prostitution because they felt pressure to buy consumer goods such as televisions. Girls stay until they contract AIDS, and are then sent back to their villages to die in disgrace.
While slavery is illegal, it is hard to eradicate. Even the United States lacks adequate criminal penalties for those who traffic in human beings. Moreover, the victims -- the potential witnesses -- are usually deported. This may change, however, as both houses of Congress recently passed a bill that would criminalize trafficking, end the rapid deportation of victims and provide help for them here and modest programs to prevent slavery abroad.
Slavery and forced labor are even more difficult to fight in nations where they draw support from traditional structures of power and corruption, the devaluation of women and, in India, the caste system. Educating the poor about how to avoid falling victim helps, as do small loans and skill training. India has an excellent program to pay off laborers' debts and give them training and land. But Dr. Bales argues that local officials and judges often sabotage it.
The first step in combating modern variations of slavery, however, is education. The developed world needs to realize that slavery exists, and that its victims may have helped produce the clothes, rugs and other goods we buy. It is especially important for people in nations where it is widespread not to accept it as a traditional practice but to see it as one of the most serious abuses of human rights.

HEADLINE: Japan Wonders What Became of Quality Control

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Since a crisis at Firestone over dangerously faulty tires erupted in the United States early last month, shareholders of Bridgestone, the large Japanese tire maker that owns Firestone, have watched in horror as the value of their shares has been sliced in half.
At virtually the same time, Japanese prosecutors raided Mitsubishi Motors twice in a single week over its systematic cover-up of manufacturing defects stretching back 30 years, and public confidence in a once proud automaker quickly evaporated -- as did more than 25 percent of its stock value. 
 Mitsubishi's president resigned today, and DaimlerChrysler, which had agreed to acquire a huge interest in the company, installed its own executive as chief operating officer and renegotiated a lower price for its stake. The German automaker plans to send more managers to try to improve the quality of Mitsubishi's car and trucks.
Coming so soon on the heels of another quality-control crisis in Japan this summer -- the sickening of nearly 15,000 people by contaminated products sold by the leading dairy producer -- many in this country once credited with perfecting quality control have begun to shake their heads over what they fear may be the most worrisome sign of decline yet in Japan: an end to its sterling reputation in manufacturing after a decade without growth.
Like the latest crises, the Snow Brand milk debacle carried a strong whiff of scandal about it.
After the outbreak of a summer staphylococcus epidemic afflicting consumers of Snow Brand products, an investigation of the company showed that workers had routinely recycled milk returned from stores, falsifying the certificate of freshness that accompanies dairy products.
News of the Snow Brand scandal has inspired a wave of consumer complaints against other food producers, and the press has been filled recently with the unsavory details from the discovery of dead lizards in potato chips to flies in canned juice.
At a recent parliamentary hearing, Deputy Health Minister Yukata Fukushima deplored the spate of defective products, calling it the result of "sloppiness and complacency."
Although they often disagree fundamentally on the details, other commentators have begun drawing much broader conclusions from the decline in product quality controls and safety, saying they reflect profound changes at work in Japan.
The theories about declining standards in industry here range from simple smugness to a lingering managerial inability to negotiate the transition from the dizzying prosperity of the 1980's to the era of downsizing and cost controls in the '90's.
Perhaps most sweeping, though, is the idea, carried in newspaper editorials and discussed seriously by noted economic experts, that Japan's prosperity has destroyed its old work ethic, casting things like the Japanese worker's vaunted attention to detail and dedication to the task into history's dustbin.
A recent column in Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest-circulation daily newspaper, deplored what it called the "disdain for hard work" among young adults. Among other facts, it cited government statistics showing that about half of the country's university graduates prefer temporary jobs and part-time work to full-time employment or graduate studies.
"The first generation of Japanese are those who rebuilt the economy amid the postwar confusion," wrote the columnist, Norio Mochizuki, Yomiuri's business news editor. "The baby boomers are the second generation. The baby boomers' children are the third generation, unwilling to work after graduation and yet strangers to poverty."
This generational theme to the hand-wringing over the recent industrial scandals, and over Japan's economic doldrums generally, has become almost fashionable, and comes in as many varieties as flavors at an ice cream shop.
With much talk of national drift in Japan, government and industry leaders have recently begun a huge drive to promote information technology, with some even saying the goal should be to quickly surpass the United States. But adherents of the generational decline theory scoff at that notion and say it overlooks basic problems with people that must be addressed first.
"For the 30 years that we struggled to rebuild the country, we were blessed with high-quality workmanship and great discipline," said Masao Kamei, 84, the chairman of Sumitomo Electric Industries and a senior adviser to past governments. "If we want to recover, we will have to recover these virtues. Without them, information technology cannot save us."
Far from simply having a problem of workers, Mr. Kamei said, Japanese managers have been made arrogant by success and lost all sense of accountability.
"We had a motto, 'Visit the manufacturing floor often,' " he said. "If this kind of principle is established, the kind of incident that happened at Snow Brand would never have happened."
Other experts dismiss the theory of a generational decline. To them the problem lies in Japan's failed adjustments to its changed circumstances, dating back to the explosion in the value of the yen in 1985.
For these experts, blame for the country's steady decline lies at the feet of the managerial class and the government. Supposed changes in social values or the work ethic are merely excuses.
According to this view, Japanese management put a heavy emphasis on cost controls during the yen's steep rise in the mid-80's, more often cutting corners on the shop floor than paring back increasingly lavish corporate spending.
Then suddenly, during the wildly speculative "bubble" period when land and stock prices soared in the late 80's, management practices became as loose as the period was overly optimistic.
Facing unexpectedly intense economic competition from a revived United States during the last 10 years of drift here, Japan has again turned its focus to cost-cutting, with the worker and the workplace suffering the sharpest cuts.
"The overemphasis of cost reduction over so many other things a firm has to think about is the common thread linking all of these recent crises," said Hiroyuki Itami, a professor of management at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo.
Mitsubishi, he said, was seeking cost savings by avoiding expensive recalls. Snow Brand was recycling a stale product and passing it off as new. And Bridgestone was trying to revive the Firestone brand and recuperate its investment at the lowest possible cost.
"I have seen so many examples of false cost reductions in quality control circles recently," said Mr. Itami, who is writing a book on Japanese corporate governance. "The end result of this kind of thing is the kind of abuses that no engineer would advocate. This is about a failure of management: a failure to weigh cost and quality considerations in the right perspective."
Yet another view of Japan's recent industrial scandals holds that things were never as good as the country's manufacturing reputation would have had it in the first place. Instead, only now for the first time, given a coincidental spate of product quality crises, consumers are stepping forward in large numbers demanding accountings from companies for a broad range of defective products.
In the past Japanese consumers were patient and accepting. And without a strong consumer movement, companies have been able to get away with things like discriminatory pricing, or quality controls that favor export markets, and handle consumer complaints as individual grievances, ignoring systemic problems with products.
"The fact that people are finding things in their food and complaining doesn't mean that these kinds of problems have suddenly skyrocketed," said Hiroko Mizuhara, secretary general of the Consumer's Union of Japan. "There have been these problems all along. It is just that in the past the companies would replace the products to the individual consumer and put a lid on it.
"The consumer is getting stronger, and now the companies cannot avoid acknowledging these crises. With the help of the media they are being forced to deal with it."

Re "The Economic Scoreboard" (editorial, Sept. 8):
Prescription drug coverage for those of us under Medicare would be wonderful! But doesn't anyone realize that the plans of both presidential candidates are like a stamp of approval for the drug companies? 
 George W. Bush and Al Gore have to guarantee some form of price controls to keep Medicare, and its beneficiaries, secure.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
In a Verdict, a Sign That His Town Is No Haven for Hate

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

DATELINE: COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho

 BODY:
STEVE JUDY was all of 28 years old, and less than a month into his job as mayor of Coeur d'Alene, when he had his first official brush with the Aryan Nations, a white supremacist group that he and countless other people in this northern Idaho city describe as an awful thorn in the side of the community. The group wanted a permit for a parade down the town's main street.
"I'm 31 now, though some days I feel 70," Mr. Judy said. "It's going to be a great book someday, I keep telling people. 'So You Want to Be a Mayor?' That's going to be the title." 
 If he ever does write a book, Mr. Judy says, then Sept. 7, 2000, will mark a jubilant chapter: the day a local jury delivered a $6.3 million verdict against the Aryan Nations, a damage award that lawyers for two victims of a 1998 attack by members of the group hope will bankrupt the organization and drive it out of the area.
Jurors made clear in interviews yesterday that the question in their 10 hours of deliberations was never really whether to punish Richard G. Butler, the self-styled pastor of the group, and his deputy, but rather by how much to punish them; for a while, some jurors held out for a judgment of as much as $100 million. In any event, the mayor said yesterday, the community sent a message with the award.
"It's the message we've always tried to give out: This is a place that cares about human rights," he said. "Maybe now we'll be known as the place that got the verdict against the Aryan Nations."
People in Coeur d'Alene seem palpably frustrated that northern Idaho has acquired a reputation as a haven for neo-Nazis and other extremists like the 82-year-old Mr. Butler, a retired aeronautics engineer who moved to his compound 20 miles north of here in the 1970's to escape what he once called the "alien scum" in Southern California. He has described the compound as the "international headquarters of the white race."
Mr. Judy says he contends with the region's image wherever he goes. "It's up there with the floating green" -- a signature hole on a golf course in this resort town -- "and the beauty of the place as a whole," he said. "Tons of people know how beautiful Coeur d'Alene is. But you also hear, 'Oh, is that where those skinheads or the Aryans are from?' "
What is less reported by the national media, he says, is the community's response to the fringe groups. First of all, there is the revulsion that most people feel for them. There is also the human-rights education fund set up with local donations, establishing a curriculum to teach schoolchildren, the mayor said, about "dignity, tolerance and respect." There are also the various honors given the town, including the Raoul Wallenberg Award, usually given to an individual but presented to the entire community in 1987 for its efforts to counteract the Aryan Nations' message.
Although some 80 skinheads and other young men gathered here in July 1998 for a march sponsored by the group, Mr. Judy feels some frustration that the community's response, a quaintly named "Lemons to Lemonade" campaign, was less well reported. Thousands of people attended a counter-rally, and some devised a pledge program for human rights that raised more than $1,000 a minute for every one of the 32 minutes the extremists marched.
MR. JUDY, citing the loss of merchant business and the added security costs created by such hubbub and tension, says the Aryan Nations has committed "economic terrorism" against his city. (Police security for the 1998 march, which ended without violence, cost more than $100,000.)
"I'm a big believer in the Constitution," the mayor said, sitting in his office at City Hall, which has a magnificent view of Lake Coeur d'Alene. "I studied constitutional law" at Gonzaga University, and "the community's rights are really second place to any organization's right to free speech." But "it just seems to fly in the face of this Republic we have that those folks can come and portray a message here that hurts people, that hurts our community, that hurts a lot of people economically. What are the community's rights in this? It just doesn't seem fair."
As for the reputation that extremists have bestowed on the area, Mr. Judy said: "We can't compete with the free media that they receive that's negative. We all want the headline to read, 'Coeur d'Alene, the city known for human rights, has this problem,' and the problem's two column inches and the rest of it is all about Coeur d'Alene and how great it is and how we respond. That's what we want. We deserve it."
But whether the jury's award will help change perceptions is an open question. A leader of the Jewish Defense League from Los Angeles recently criticized Coeur d'Alene for what he called its "placid" response to the Aryan Nations over the years. And even if the group's members leave, northern Idaho will remain one of the least ethnically diverse places in the nation: the black population is 0.2 percent, according to census figures, and the Hispanic population about 2.5 percent.
Mr. Judy is up for re-election next year but says he has not yet decided whether to run. He certainly seems politically inclined -- he worked for five years as a Senate aide in Washington -- but he has a family with three young boys to support. At $1,000 a month, his salary is far from lavish, and he and his wife are hoping to establish a business soon.
Still, he said, Coeur d'Alene sent a powerful message with the verdict on Thursday, and he is proud to be a public official here.
"I think we've struggled against hate and against the Aryans for so long here," he said, "a victory like this is a big deal to all of us."

To the Editor:
Re "Competing to Make Things Worse," by Richard A. Epstein (Op-Ed, Sept. 7): Mr. Epstein aptly criticizes both candidates' proposals to cover prescription drugs for the elderly. The economies achieved by privatization versus the security afforded by government-financed programs has become a partisan issue. This is good fare for debating, but the kiss of death for federal action. 
 Why not enliven the debate over adding prescription drug coverage by throwing in controlled tax-cutting for the elderly?
By giving the wealthy elderly a tax credit for their prescription coverage, by paying for the prescription coverage of the poor, and calculating a sliding scale for everyone else, we might have an experimental stalking horse for subsequent Medicare reform.

To the Editor:
It is incomprehensible that George W. Bush would make health maintenance organizations and insurance companies central to his prescription drug plan (front page, Sept. 6). Most Medicare recipients have rejected H.M.O.'s in favor of fee-for-service, and both consumers and companies are turning away from H.M.O.'s because of increasing premiums, financial failures and discontent with restriction of care. 
 Insurance companies have indicated their unwillingness to take part in a government-subsidized prescription drug plan as an economically undesirable venture. Why, then, does Mr. Bush endorse this course of action? Perhaps it is more of a tactical maneuver as a political spoiler rather than a genuine desire to improve the lot of the elderly.

The Surplus

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "2 Candidates, 1 Plan: Spend the Surplus," by Stephen S. Roach (Op-Ed, Sept. 5): 
 Mr. Roach says Al Gore and George W. Bush "seem determined to spend a significant portion of the nation's budget surplus." And while he acknowledges the differences in how each would spend it, by proposing to spend primarily on health care and education, Mr. Gore aims at investing directly in human capital. Such overdue investments would likely result in long-term benefits in quality of life and productivity. The ensuing productivity gains are bound to stimulate sustainable economic growth.
In contrast, the tax cuts proposed by Mr. Bush will have a much smaller and only indirect effect on improvements in education and health.

HEADLINE: Negative Impressions Influence a Senate Race

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

DATELINE: TROY, N.Y., Sept. 5

 BODY:
Ellen Lehman really wanted Rick Lazio to be her man. Though she identifies herself as a Democrat at heart, Ms. Lehman said she was fed up with the Clintons and hoped that Mr. Lazio, the young Republican congressman with the nice family, would be the one to represent her in the United States Senate.
"I thought anyone would be better than Hillary," said Ms. Lehman, 56, a retired data entry operator sitting in front of a faded brownstone in downtown Troy. But as she learned more about Mr. Lazio, mostly from newspaper articles and television ads, she decided she did not like him much, either. "Now I'm going to vote for Hillary, which I never thought would happen." 
 Many voters in this small, industrial city on the Hudson River, just north of Albany, are struggling to hold down jobs and raise families in aging neighborhoods. They say they view politics as the means to improve their lives, but do not necessarily stick with a particular party or candidate. Along with the 7,500 registered Democrats and 5,300 Republicans in Troy, there are 9,500 voters who are independent or have not declared a party affiliation.
In the last Senate race, in 1998, Troy gave Charles E. Schumer, the Democrat, about 50 percent of its vote, and the Republican incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato, 48 percent. But this was offset by the rest of Rensselaer County, where there is a stronger Republican tradition (26,900 registered Republicans, 23,800 Democrats). In the county as a whole, Mr. D'Amato received 52 percent of the vote and Mr. Schumer, 46 percent.
Whatever their politics, voters in Troy said they wanted tax cuts, health care improvements and an infusion of money for public schools and redevelopment projects. But in conversations on sidewalks, at bus stops and inside one cozy diner, they were more likely to cite the shortcomings of Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr. Lazio than any of their policy initiatives.
As upstaters, they remain deeply suspicious of Mr. Lazio, from Suffolk County on Long Island, and even more so of Mrs. Clinton, who moved to Westchester County just before she formally announced that she would run for office. They question whether either candidate truly grasps the needs of a city that was literally broke five years ago. Times are better now, but Troy is hardly the thriving manufacturing center it was in its heyday in the 1800's.
Though some voters are still withholding judgment, Ms. Lehman and others have already decided to vote for the candidate who seems least offensive to them in a race that has been rife with hostility. In recent weeks, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio have sought to take the high ground while accusing each other of underhanded campaigning and at the same time firing off a new round of inflammatory charges.
But in and around Troy, the negative tactics seem to be working.
Ms. Lehman, for instance, said she could no longer support Mr. Lazio because she disagreed with his votes on Medicare and education issues in Congress. "I think his campaign was misleading," she said. "He said he was for these things, but they dug up that he really wasn't."
In recent ads, Mrs. Clinton's campaign has accused Mr. Lazio of voting against Medicare spending, when in fact he had voted to cut increases in the spending. Her campaign has also criticized Mr. Lazio for voting against a Democratic bill to provide financing for 100,000 more teachers, though he voted for a Republican bill that did much the same thing.
Mr. Lazio's unflattering portrayal of Mrs. Clinton -- as a carpetbagger without a political record -- has also resonated with voters. "You just hear that people don't like Hillary, you don't hear about the issues," said James Moore, 22, a building materials salesman who was walking through the nearly deserted downtown last weekend. "Unless you're really into politics, they're not doing a good job of explaining the issues and what they stand for."
Mr. Moore, a recent graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, said he considered himself a voter without a party, or a candidate. To earn his loyalty, he said, a candidate must address education issues, like college loans, and revitalizing the upstate economy. "I don't see myself voting for either of them," he said. "But I could be swayed if I heard something that would impact my life."
Both candidates have recently proposed tax cuts -- Mr. Lazio's to spur the economy and Mrs. Clinton's to be aimed at specific income groups. And Mrs. Clinton has even put together a specific upstate revival plan. But most voters interviewed around Troy seemed unaware of those proposals. Instead, they spoke of the candidates in general terms and struggled to discuss any specific campaign issue or platform.
Mrs. Clinton remains better known to Democrats and Republicans alike after her nearly eight years in the public spotlight as the first lady and because of her head start in the Senate race. She has been campaigning for more than a year around the state, including several times in Troy. Mr. Lazio jumped in this spring after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani withdrew from the race to undergo treatment for prostate cancer.
But voters continue to raise things that Mrs. Clinton has tried to leave behind: her husband's dalliance with an intern, his impeachment, Whitewater. They said those embarrassments had left a negative impression. "I've heard a lot about Hillary," said Audrey Slocum, 71, a retired cook waiting at a corner bus stop. "It's not all negative, and she's probably a very smart woman, but I just don't like her. I don't trust her. She wants power; I think that's obvious."
Ms. Slocum, a longtime Republican, had heard much less about her own party's candidate, even though her state senator, Joseph L. Bruno, who represents Rensselaer County, was one of the first political leaders to back Mr. Lazio publicly. "He seems to be a very nice man," Ms. Slocum said of Mr. Lazio. "He follows the Republican line, and I tend to be conservative."
At the counter in Barb's Coffee-Tyme in downtown Troy, the regulars talked more favorably about Mrs. Clinton between bites of scrambled eggs and sips of steaming coffee. Judy Grugan, 51, a housekeeper sitting on a black vinyl stool, praised the first lady for focusing attention on special education. Her 15-year-old son has a reading disability. "That's one of her main goals, her and the kids, and the schools have improved even around here," said Ms. Grugan, a Democrat who decided to vote for Mrs. Clinton long before Mr. Lazio entered the race.
But other coffee shop regulars said they knew too much about Mrs. Clinton for comfort. When asked which candidate they would most likely vote for, most said they did not know or named someone altogether different: Mayor Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki, even the retiring incumbent, Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
"I don't like Lazio because of his political philosophy," said William Sullivan, 75, a retired truck driver and lifelong Democrat as he stared morosely at his empty plate. "She's all right but I don't think she's the best candidate either. It's unfortunate that our present senator is going to retire. They just don't have the political skills that he has."
