HEADLINE: A Small Border War Turns, but Is Not Yet Won 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: DOUGLAS, Ariz., Feb. 17 

 BODY:
A year ago, this small town on the border with Mexico was in chaos. 
 Federal law enforcement officials had clamped down on other, more popular border crossings, effectively funneling illegal immigrants, many with children, into the Douglas area at a rate of hundreds of thousands a year. Angry ranchers responded by arming themselves and patrolling their property. The Ku Klux Klan showed up to lend support. 
 Today, downtown is quiet, and the number of illegal immigrants seized while crossing here was 40 percent lower in the four months from October to February than in the corresponding period a year earlier, among the steepest such declines along the 1,952-mile border.
Stepped-up operations by the Border Patrol, as well as new economic hope in Mexico, are responsible for the change, officials say. But while the flow of immigrants across the border has been slowed, it has not been entirely stanched, and the Border Patrol has earned only the slightest hint of praise from residents here.
"They've decreased the flow of people across my property by maybe 40 to 50 percent, but they're just coming on everyone else's place," said Roger Barnett, who owns a 22,000-acre ranch northeast of town. 
Moreover, Border Patrol agents and local officials alike say the new efforts have driven many illegal immigrants into the rugged mountains and arid desert to the east and west, where there is a greater risk of dying of exposure and thirst. Seventeen border crossers have died in the area around Douglas during the last four and a half months, compared with 18 during the previous 12.
"The strategy is working in terms of keeping illegal immigrants out of the community, but in essence all they've done is pushed them out to the extremities," said Raymond A. Borane, mayor of Douglas, a town of only 17,000 across the border from Agua Prieta, Mexico.
As it had in San Diego and El Paso, two other cities inundated by illegal migrants from Mexico, the Border Patrol bolstered security sharply here. Now every few hundred yards for six miles -- along much of which lies a 12-foot-high black metal wall that gives way on either end to a gnarled barbed-wire fence in the desert -- armed agents are stationed in sport utility vehicles as round-the-clock sentries against illegal crossing.
Before the wall went up, only a chain-link fence erected more than half a century ago separated the two countries at this part of the border. 
The Border Patrol also doubled the number of its agents here last year, to 600, and rushed in seismic sensors, pole-mounted cameras and night-vision scopes. 
All this helped bring a calm, however tenuous, to Douglas's streets. But that calm belies larger problems facing the Bush administration, which must now grapple with an array of immigration-related challenges, including a border strategy.
The White House has proposed cutting $1 billion from the 2002 budget of the Justice Department, parent agency of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which includes the Border Patrol. How the White House wants to distribute those cuts has not yet been announced, but reductions at the I.N.S., immigration officials say, would hurt its ability to deal with new responsibilities Congress added last year to adjust the status of as many as 700,000 immigrants. 
Then there is the immigration service's future shape. President Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft want to split it into two agencies -- one to deal with law enforcement, the other to provide services to immigrants.
But Mr. Bush has so far offered no other details for revamping an agency troubled by scandal and poor morale, other than to promise an additional $500 million over five years to improve services, a pledge that could be jeopardized by the proposed budget cuts. 
Further, the president has yet to appoint an I.N.S. commissioner, a choice that will probably signal whether he bows to influential Republicans who want to restrict immigration or hews to a mostly pro-immigrant position he took as Texas governor. 
The signal he sends is crucial to states like this one, where, according to a recent University of Arizona study, four border counties spend $23 million a year on law enforcement and health care related to illegal migrants. Those counties -- Pima, Cochise, Yuma and Santa Cruz -- want the federal government to reimburse them for those expenses. 
In Santa Cruz County's largest city, Nogales, on the border 80 miles west of Douglas, Border Patrol agents in helmets and short pants patrol downtown streets on bicycles. The agents say they give chase daily to dozens of illegal immigrants who wend their way through a maze of sewer tunnels and squeeze out onto the streets from manholes and drainage grates. 
One grate is across the street from Sacred Heart Church. I.N.S. policy bars agents from pursuit into churches and schools, and migrants and those who smuggle them across the border know it.
"There's a big cat-and-mouse game between the bike patrol and the smugglers, who make a mad dash for the church," said Todd Jewell, a supervisory agent. 
Here in Douglas, the step-up in operations last year was accompanied by a change in tactics. Instead of roving around on patrol, some agents are now stacked along the border, much as if it were the Maginot Line. Behind this generally stationary line, plainclothes agents prowl in unmarked cars, while other, highly visible squads also watch the roads. 
On the 3-to-11 shift the other night, Supervisory Agent Ross DeLacy's radio crackled with reports of people trying to slip through a hilly area east of the main, legal crossing. "Want to go up there and do some battle?" another supervisor ordered his agents. 
A few miles to the west, two other migrants dashed across the border into thorny mesquite brush. Mr. DeLacy's S.U.V. barreled through winding gullies, while two other agents gave chase on foot. In the control room back at the Douglas station, dispatchers monitored the chase on banks of televisions linked to remote cameras and sensors. 
The border crossers briefly eluded the agents but were captured within an hour, adding to a night's statistics compiled by 100 agents on duty: 187 people arrested, 182 deterred from crossing, 63 who turned back after crossing and 13 who got away on this side of the border. An average night, agents said. 
Over in Nogales, at a Border Patrol detention center -- a stark holding area with separate cells for men, women and children -- Efraim Mesquita, a 35-year-old laborer who had been picked up trying to sneak in on a truck, mulled his next move. 
Agents ran a computer check that showed he had no criminal record in the United States, so he was to be fingerprinted and sent back to Mexico, a process that would take a few hours, agents said. 
But Mr. Mesquita seemed ready to try again. He said he had traveled nearly 1,000 miles from his home in the state of Guanajuato, where, he said, he could not earn enough to support his wife and five children. 
"Yeah," he agreed, "it's getting tougher to cross. But I will do whatever I can."

HEADLINE: Spy-Hunt Team Followed Trail To F.B.I. Agent 

BYLINE:  By JAMES RISEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
A secret investigative team established in 1994 to identify the source of a series of damaging intelligence losses played a crucial role in the counterespionage probe that led to the arrest on Sunday of an F.B.I. agent, Robert Philip Hanssen, officials said today. 
 The "mole hunting" unit -- a joint operation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency whose existence has never before been disclosed -- was formed because investigators could not explain why intelligence operations against Russia continued to be compromised even after the arrest of Aldrich H. Ames, a senior C.I.A. covert officer. 
 Shortly after Mr. Ames's capture in February 1994, they concluded it was unlikely he could have been responsible for all the intelligence losses of the previous few years. 
The most damaging was the apparent disclosure of an elaborate and costly technical intelligence program that focused on Russian activities in the United States, officials said. The apparent compromise of that program -- which remains highly classified and which officials refused to describe -- may have cost the United States hundreds of millions of dollars, according to current and former American officials. 
Other unexplained breaches -- including the 1989 disclosure to Moscow that the F.B.I. was conducting an espionage investigation of Felix S. Bloch, a State Department official -- helped prompt a new search for a spy inside the federal government, officials added.
Yet some officials said that the driving force behind the formation of the new counterespionage unit was the need to learn what had happened to the technical intelligence program; they believe that Mr. Hanssen's arrest may solve that mystery.
In addition to K.G.B. officers working as double agents for the F.B.I. whom Mr. Hanssen is believed to have betrayed, officials say that the loss of that one program represents the most severe damage he did to the United States during what they say was a 15-year career as a Russian spy.
The special investigative unit, which works within the counterespionage group at the C.I.A.'s Counterintelligence Center, was created by Paul Redmond, who had led the earlier effort to apprehend Mr. Ames. The unit was responsible for a series of investigations that led to the arrests of other significant spies caught after Mr. Ames, officials say.
Those include two cases concluded in 1997, when Earl Edwin Pitts, an F.B.I. agent, was sentenced to 27 years in prison for spying for Russia, and Harold J. Nicholson, a former C.I.A. station chief in Romania, was sentenced to more than 23 years. 
Officials indicated that the Pitts and Nicholson cases were byproducts of the C.I.A.'s and F.B.I.'s shared desire to solve the mysteries that remained after Mr. Ames's arrest.
Most notably, American intelligence officials began an aggressive effort to recruit Russian intelligence officers who could identify the source of the leak of United States secrets. The effort to find talkative Russians was made easier by the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and the severe economic and political troubles of post-Soviet Russia.
That effort paid dividends in the Pitts case. Information from a Russian source led the F.B.I. to run a 16-month sting operation against Mr. Pitts, with F.B.I. agents posing as Russian spies.
Information from Russia also played a role in the Nicholson case, though his troubles in passing a polygraph exam helped identify him as a spy, officials said. 
But the two cases were unable to explain the earlier losses, officials said, and the mole hunt continued. 
Officials said that the investigation took a series of wrong turns. Some reports from Russia prompted investigators to look for another Russian spy within the C.I.A., former officials said.
In fact, the post-Ames hunt for spies within the agency led to what some former intelligence officials considered crippling excesses, with C.I.A. officers who had worked on Russian operations forced to undergo repeated polygraph exams.
One officer, placed on administrative leave, has been the subject of an investigation to determine whether he spied for Russia. With Mr. Hanssen's arrest, officials said, the status of that case is uncertain. 
Over the years, there were also suggestions that the losses could be attributed to a source inside the F.B.I. There was evidence, for example, that the Russians knew of a particular F.B.I. technical intelligence operation that a C.I.A.-based mole probably would not have known. 
"It was plain that the K.G.B. knew what it was and went right to it and found it, and it was obvious that a source had to have told them about it," said one former intelligence official. "That was completely an F.B.I. operation, which had produced very good counterintelligence information for the bureau, and it was inconceivable that Ames knew about it."
After the Ames case, though, the F.B.I. did not impose the scrutiny that the C.I.A. did, officials now acknowledge.
Yet officials said that there had also been some effort to analyze the possibility of a mole in the F.B.I's ranks. Counterintelligence experts were starting to focus on the possibility that the Russians had a source in the F.B.I. before evidence was provided to the United States from a Russian source pointing to Mr. Hanssen, officials said.
The efforts of the joint mole hunt were finally rewarded late last year, when a Russian source provided what seems to be virtually the entire K.G.B. file on the Hanssen case.
The special investigative unit was a successor to an earlier and equally secretive C.I.A. internal investigative team that helped uncover Mr. Ames. The unit is still in operation today because officials believe it is possible other foreign agents continue to operate within the federal government.
The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence plans to hold its first closed-door hearing about the Hanssen case on Wednesday. According to the committee, Attorney General John Ashcroft, Director Louis J. Freeh of the F.B.I. and George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, are scheduled to testify.

TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES WARNS OF LOWER EARNINGS

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 Teledyne Technologies Inc. forecast lower first-quarter and full-year earnings yesterday and said it would temporarily lay off about 2 percent of its work force as sales and profits fell in the aerospace engines and components division because of the weakening economy. Teledyne, based in Los Angeles, said it also expects an earnings decline in its electronics and communications division as it does not expect demand for its relay products for semiconductor test equipment to recover in the near term. The company estimated first-quarter earnings at about 15 cents a share. Wall Street analysts had on average estimated a profit of 25 cents.

HEADLINE: S.& P. Lowers Its Rating on Japanese Debt 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, lowered its rating on Japan's debt today, citing the country's growing fiscal inflexibility as public spending rises while an economic overhaul remains stalled. 
 The downgrade, the first by Standard & Poor's since it initially assigned a rating to Japan in 1975, caused only a few ripples in the currency, bond and stock markets here. 
But the rating is yet another sign that Japan's economic outlook is growing steadily bleaker. 
 S.& P., after similar moves by its rival, Moody's Investors Service, lowered its rating on Japan's long-term yen-denominated and foreign currency debt to AA+ from its highest rating of AAA. Of the Group of Seven leading industrial powers, only Italy (AA) has a lower rating. (The United States, Canada, Germany, France and Britain all have triple-A ratings.)
The downgrade, analysts said, was a clear criticism of Japanese politicians who have shown little political resolve to tackle structural problems and set a path toward fiscal reconstruction.
"It is a fairly justifiable step given that the politicians are doing nothing to stop the public debt from mounting," said Richard Jerram, an economist with ING Barings here.
The yen weakened briefly against the dollar after the rating downgrade was announced, but the Nikkei stock index of 225 issues ended up 1.32 percent today, and bond prices also rose slightly.

HEADLINE: Motorola Says It May Post Quarterly Loss, First in 15 Years 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
Its shares already battered by a yearlong profit slide, Motorola Inc. said today that weakening demand for its products could result in the company's first quarterly loss in 15 years.
 Motorola, one of the world's biggest makers of cellular telephones and semiconductors, blamed a sharp economic slowdown in the United States and widespread inventory buildup in the technology industry. 
 The company also said it would sharply reduce its capital spending this year and was considering closing at least four additional manufacturing plants, after shutting six or so others in the last two months.
Wall Street analysts were surprised by the announcement, which came with more than a month to go in the first quarter. They were also stunned by the extent of the revision, which could shave the company's previous $250 million profit estimate for the first quarter down to zero. 
"It's a pretty big hit," said Greg Teets, an analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "It's a cost structure problem. They're built to volume, so they can't take out the costs fast enough."
Shares of Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., dropped another $1.04, to $16.25, on the New York Stock Exchange, slightly above their 52-week low of $15.81.
The announcement comes just weeks after Motorola closed its last domestic cell phone manufacturing plant, eliminating 4,000 jobs, and announced the closing of several other plants in an aggressive effort to rapidly lower its costs.
More cuts and job eliminations are expected because the company said that preliminary first-quarter figures showed that sales and orders were down significantly in its cellular phone and semiconductor units, making it increasingly unlikely that the company would meet its own earnings forecast of 12 cents a share on sales of $8.8 billion. The company gave no further guidance on a first-quarter profit or loss.
A year ago, in the first quarter of 2000, the company earned $449 million, or 59 cents a share. If Motorola registers a loss in the first quarter of this year, it would be the first operating loss since 1985. The company did, however, take a nearly $2 billion charge in 1998.
In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, however, Motorola executives said similar problems were plaguing other cell phone and semiconductor companies.
"We believe that this weakness is the result of current industrywide conditions and not a loss of market share," Robert L. Growney, the president and chief operating officer of Motorola, said of the cell phone and communications division. "These conditions include excess inventories in the distribution channel, slowing overall market growth and some resulting increase in pricing pressures."
The company said, however, that several other divisions, including its broadband unit, were faring much better.
Yet for Motorola, whose shares have tumbled nearly 75 percent in the last year, the news has been almost entirely bad. The company has acknowledged that its cost structure is out of line, and that it is suffering, in part, because of pricing pressure and growing demand for lower-cost cell phones and not the more expensive models it makes.
Indeed, Wall Street analysts say that Motorola, the No. 2 cell phone maker, has not been as adept at manufacturing as Nokia, the Finnish cell phone maker that is No. 1, and that it has also underperformed in the semiconductor market.
"I just visited Nokia, and there were a lot fewer people at their plants and things were a lot more automated," Mr. Teets at A. G. Edwards said. "I think part of this is a management problem. Motorola has done a lot of interesting things over the years, they just haven't done it profitably."
Scott Searle, an analyst at SG Cowen, agreed: "Motorola's been losing share in handsets and semiconductors, and they've been struggling with profitability. Motorola was turning out too many products, and I think they were overdesigning too many products."
Still, most analysts say that the company's competitors, like Ericsson and Texas Instruments, are also struggling with slowdowns, and that Motorola could see significant improvements in the second half of the year. 
Motorola, which has reshuffled its management and restructured many of its operations, said that some new alliances, like one with Nortel Networks, one of the biggest suppliers of telecommunications equipment, and new products could lead to improvements later in the year. 
For now, analysts say the already depressed shares of Motorola probably will not move much higher or lower. "The stock is probably not going to go a lot lower in the near term; I see no catalyst," Mr. Searle said. "It's probably dead for the next 90 days, until we know more."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Bush Backs Turkish Efforts To Resolve Economic Crisis

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ with DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
Seeking to bolster a struggling ally, President Bush telephoned Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit of Turkey today to offer his support for the country's efforts to cope with its second economic crisis in three months.
 Mr. Bush, in a five-minute conversation, expressed support for Turkey's economic overhaul and discussed the importance of continuing to work with the International Monetary Fund, the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said. 
 The Turkish currency extended its slide today, falling an additional 10 percent in value against the dollar. Turkish authorities decided on Thursday to abandon currency controls after a financial crisis was ignited by a political dispute between Mr. Ecevit and the country's president, Ahmet Necdet Sezer. The Turkish currency, the lira, has now fallen more than 35 percent in two days.
The message of support from Washington was notable because Mr. Bush, during the presidential campaign, expressed deep reservations about the I.M.F.'s programs, and strongly suggested that he would hesitate to bail out countries or investors who found themselves caught in an economic downturn.
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill has gone further, saying in an interview that the 1998 bailout of Russia was "crazy" and adding that he did not understand why it would be beneficial to intervene to stabilize a country's currency.
But today, Mr. Bush and Mr. O'Neill received a quick lesson in why politics, as much as economics, may drive such decisions.
Turkey is a NATO partner and allows its bases to be used by American planes patrolling Iraq. It says it has been harmed by the economic sanctions against Saddam Hussein, and Mr. Bush is struggling to keep a coalition together that will enforce such sanctions. Unrest in Turkey could imperil that effort.
The effects of the devaluation of the lira are now being felt. Prices for cigarettes and bread were higher in some Istanbul neighborhoods today, and manufacturers were warning of price increases for imported goods.
Turkey's banks also were hard hit by the weaker lira, which meant that their foreign debts were suddenly more expensive.
The I.M.F. was forced to bail out Turkey with a $7.5 billion loan in December after a retreat by foreign investors threatened the country's year-old economic initiative, which has been aimed at curbing inflation and government spending.
Mr. Bush did not promise any new money today. But the call was important because the United States is the largest shareholder in the I.M.F. and can effectively stop aid to a country.
Experts said the damage caused by the latest crisis and the devaluation would continue until strong measures were announced by the government, which was in talks with officials from the I.M.F. today.
Deputy Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz made a tentative step today, when he said the government had agreed to make unspecified economic changes. "As a government, we have already reached agreement on the need for a reordering in economic management," Mr. Yilmaz said, according to the state-run Anatolia news agency.
But in the financial markets, the lira continued to be attacked.
"What the markets need at the moment is a strong political dedication to restore the economy and a new program that could gain the support of the related circles," said Oner Ayan, an investment manager with Raymond James & Associates in New York.

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
When President Andres Pastrana travels to Washington this weekend for his first meeting with President Bush, he will ask for trade preferences to spur his country's economic growth, rather than pressing ahead with earlier plans to request $600 million a year in new aid.
 In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Pastrana said he wanted to steer the discussion away from the fight against drug trafficking and the annual aid Colombia would need to finance the effort. 
 "The idea is to show another face, so that the topic is not just narco-trafficking, but rather the commerce theme," said the president, who will leave for the United States on Sunday and meet with Mr. Bush on Tuesday. 
"For that reason, we are saying to the United States, 'We are not interested in the dollar from the United States,' " Mr. Pastrana said. "If you give us the possibility to compete, to engage in global commerce, we will compete with the world."
Mr. Pastrana, whose presidency ends next year, said he wanted Colombia to receive the same tariff reductions given to Caribbean and Central American nations through last year's Caribbean Basin Initiative. Colombia, not covered by that trade pact, is instead one of four countries included in the Andean Trade Preference Act, a decade-old accord that is up for renewal in December.
But the Andean pact, which was intended to stimulate commerce in drug-producing countries, does not offer benefits for textiles and apparel, important products of Colombia. And Colombia's government, locked in a grinding guerrilla war while trying to extricate itself from its worst recession in 70 years, says it needs immediate trade preferences to save jobs, especially in the textile industry.
Mr. Pastrana said that unless Colombia received trade preferences, some 200,000 jobs could be lost here as American buyers rush to import goods from Caribbean Initiative countries. That could have dire consequences, he said, for a country that has come to recognize that economic and social problems must be resolved if a 37-year-old conflict is to end.
The president said Colombia needed economic accords that would "protect jobs for Colombians, which is what will prevent that a good part of the young men and women go off to the conflict, that they go to war."
His comments were in contrast to earlier comments from Colombian officials who said they wanted the Bush administration to provide, for the foreseeable future, about $600 million in annual assistance for economic and social programs, especially in coca-producing regions. 
Last year, the United States Congress approved a two-year $1.3 billion program to the Andean region, most of it in military aid to Colombia. The aid, intended to wipe out 50 percent of Colombia's coca crop by 2005, made Colombia the third-largest recipient of American foreign aid.
But Colombian officials, as well as Congressional leaders, voiced concern that unless Colombia received sustained aid in the coming years, the country would be unable to resolve deep-seated problems that led people to grow coca in the first place. Colombia's ambassador in Washington, Luis Alberto Moreno, was among those who said his country needed $600 million annually in the coming years.
In recent weeks, American policy makers and legislators have talked about a smaller package, perhaps $400 million for Colombia and $600 million more to be spread among Colombia's neighbors, which are suffering spillover from Colombia's conflict. Even that proposal, however, may be pared back because of the Bush administration's proposed tax cuts.
"That's still under debate in Washington," said a high-ranking United States official who has worked on the proposals. "What I've heard is, it's under very close scrutiny."
The meeting between the two presidents, both sons of former presidents, comes as American aid in the form of helicopters and training for counternarcotics battalions of the army has wiped away about 75,000 acres of coca in Colombia's coca-growing provinces of Putumayo and Caqueta in two months. Fumigation has destroyed nearly a third of that southern region's coca crop, a feat that has American and Colombian officials boasting about the success of eradication programs.
But in formulating a policy toward Colombia, the Bush administration will have to contend with a series of new problems that have arisen since the Clinton administration won support for its antidrug program here.
American and Colombian officials say, for instance, that earlier estimates of coca production in Colombia were too conservative. Instead of 300,000 acres of coca, they say, there were probably 370,000 acres or more when spraying began in late December. And much of this was situated not in rebel strongholds, but rather in regions run by right-wing paramilitaries.
All of this comes at a time when Colombia is struggling with a 20 percent unemployment rate and the flight of capital out of the country.
Experts say the Bush administration must decide whether to maintain the Clinton administration's program, or re-engineer aid and look for other ways to bolster the Colombian state.
"I think for Bush it has to be a real question of, is this a first step to a larger, continued plan?" said Russell Crandall, a political scientist at Davidson College in North Carolina whose book on American policy toward Colombia will be published this year. "Or will they say, 'Well, this is Clinton's plan, and we're going to try something different?' " 
Some in Congress have seen the need for legislation to help Colombia -- which until the mid-1990's had one of Latin America's healthiest economies -- out of its doldrums. Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, has introduced a bill that would renew the Andean trade pact sooner, cutting tariffs for textiles and other products that Colombia and its neighbors produce, like oil and petroleum byproducts.
Said Michael Shifter, a Colombia expert at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy research group, "If you're really serious about turning around Colombia, and one of the instruments is to eradicate the coca fields, then certainly the other instrument is a trade bill that creates employment."
Mr. Pastrana said he considered a quick expansion of the Andean pact a necessity if Colombia was to recover economically. 
"We cannot wait until next year or we'll get killed," he said, referring to textile manufacturers covered by the Caribbean initiative. "People will prefer to make their investments in Central America rather than come to Colombia because they can now begin to capture the market."

HEADLINE: Our Iraq Policy Is Not Working 

BYLINE:  By Robert A. Pape; Robert A. Pape teaches at the University of Chicago and is author of "Bombing to Win: Air Power and Coercion in War."

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
America's policy to contain Iraq is rapidly unraveling. The package of coercive levers used in the 1990's -- economic sanctions, weapons inspections and the no-fly zones -- is coming unglued. Indeed, this containment policy has not succeeded in its goals of ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction or ousting Saddam Hussein. The policy only antagonizes our coalition allies, and it should be abandoned. 
 After the Gulf War in 1991, the United States and its coalition partners put Iraq in the three-sided box of sanctions, inspections and no-fly zones. After 10 years, the record is mixed: Mr. Hussein still stands and still has weapons of mass destruction, but Iraq has not rebuilt its conventional army or acquired new missile technology. 
 It's time to acknowledge that this strategy has lost any hope of achieving its most ambitious goals. Oil sanctions are no longer working. The sanctions began to unravel in the late 1990's as Western demand for oil rose and as it became clear that Iraqi civilians were the primary victims of an economic embargo. Under an oil-for-food program, Iraq was allowed to sell oil and use the proceeds to buy food and medicine. By 2000, as world demand for oil rose, the upper limits on oil exports were eliminated. Recently, Iraq opened a new oil pipeline through Syria, bypassing the United Nations system completely and contributing some $2 million a day to Mr. Hussein's coffers.
New weapons inspections are also unlikely to work any better than those in the past. After almost a decade of the most intense inspection regime ever, the inspectors still believe Saddam has secreted away thousands of pounds of materials, more than enough to threaten every Israeli and many Arabs. Even if we found them, Iraq could always make more. Since many of our allies recognize these hard facts, the odds of strong support for new inspections are exceedingly low. 
Even the no-fly zones over southern and northern Iraq are not working. They increasingly antagonize our allies, anger our rivals, and cause diplomatic problems throughout the Arab world at a moment of heightened conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. 
The problem is simple. Every time Saddam Hussein improves his air defenses, the United States must attack them or accept greater danger to American pilots on routine air patrols. Indeed, since January 1999, the United States has carried out more than 190 air attacks on Iraq. 
Our allies never agreed to weekly bombing runs, and many have had their fill. France and Turkey have questioned the latest air strikes and the legality of no-fly zones, which are not under United Nations authority. Turkey's reaction is important, because it provides the key air base for the northern no-fly zone. The coalition that has held together since the Gulf war is in danger of coming apart.
Given these facts, shouldn't we try something else? American leverage is fast eroding. The United States should therefore stop pursuing the futile goals of weakening Mr. Hussein's rule and ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. Instead, we must concentrate on keeping the coalition together. That means finding something we can all agree on, and that means maintaining American forces in the region to deter Iraqi aggression over the long haul. Maybe then, instead of conducting bombing that does little but barely maintain the status quo, we will have international support when, and if, a real crisis erupts that requires our immediate intervention.

HEADLINE: BUSH TELLS BLAIR HE DOESN'T OPPOSE NEW EUROPE FORCE 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: THURMONT, Md., Feb. 23 

 BODY:
President Bush today endorsed a European rapid-reaction force, telling Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain that the United States had no objections to a separate military arm to help keep peace in Europe as long as that force was clearly secondary to NATO.
 The announcement, at the opening of Mr. Blair's two-day visit at Camp David, was notable because both Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had indicated reservations about the European force, which would make use of NATO equipment and could be dispatched on missions that the United States did not endorse, or chose not to join. 
 During a news conference at a rustic lodge just outside the gates of the snow-covered presidential retreat, Mr. Bush also said China's leadership had responded this morning to his complaints that Chinese workers were detected building a fiber-optic communications system linking Iraq's air defenses. 
Mr. Bush said that "if I could paraphrase" the Chinese answer, "it was, 'if this is the case, we'll remedy the situation.' " 
While Mr. Bush and his national security aides declined to elaborate on the message, the president said he would accept the Chinese response -- unless the United States gathered further evidence of Chinese aid to the Iraqi military. "I think you've always got to begin with trust until proven otherwise," Mr. Bush said.
The informal setting of today's meeting and the message of solidarity between Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair -- especially on how to contain Iraq's leader, Saddam Hussein -- were clearly intended to dampen fears on both sides of the Atlantic that Mr. Bush would prove unable to strike the kind of close, easygoing friendship with Mr. Blair that former President Bill Clinton enjoyed.
The prime minister and Mr. Clinton shared a political philosophy and spent hours discussing their search for a "third way" in politics that bridged traditional arguments between liberal and conservative philosophies. That phrase never came up today. But Mr. Bush talked about how he and Mr. Blair had walked the grounds of Camp David, including to the lodge where Churchill and Roosevelt had met. The two leaders' wives came along for the visit.
When asked what they had in common, Mr. Bush reached for a laugh line, saying, "Well, we both use Colgate toothpaste," leading Mr. Blair to say, "They're going to wonder how you know that, George." 
In fact, there were differences, mostly over Mr. Blair's polite but carefully constructed effort to avoid endorsing Mr. Bush's plan for a national missile defense, which would require British cooperation to make the system a reality.
Mr. Blair coolly said he would "welcome a dialogue" on the subject and added, "It's important that we look at every single way we possibly can of dealing with this threat."
But clearly both sides had concluded that it was unnecessary to debate the issue now, before the United States had settled on a plan. That gives Mr. Blair some political room to maneuver in Britain, where the project appears unpopular, derided by some as ineffective and others as a sign that the United States is seeking to hide behind a high-tech shield no matter what course its allies want to choose.
A joint communique split the difference: it spoke of deterring "new threats with a strategy that encompasses both offensive and defensive systems," and continued reductions in nuclear arms and greater control over the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
In the dispute over both the missile shield and the rapid reaction force, Mr. Blair finds himself caught in the middle. He must appease the new administration of a strong and longstanding British ally. But he must also show leadership within the European Union as it moves from an economic unit to a more cohesive military alliance -- leadership all the more important because of Britain's decision to delay adoption of the euro, the common European currency. 
Mr. Bush appeared to be trying not to push his guest too far at a first meeting. Both he and Mr. Blair, for example, know that Britain would likely have no choice but to make available at least one British radar site for use as part of any American missile shield. The United States already runs numerous radar and intelligence-gathering sites in Britain. 
But the Blair government clearly does not share Mr. Bush's enthusiasm for the system. "It's only a partial solution," one British diplomat said last week. "Not much help with a suitcase bomb, or biological weapons, is it?"
Similarly, Mr. Blair has been trying to satisfy Europeans' yearning for their own rapid-reaction force, without setting off fears in Washington that 60,000 or so European troops on call for interventions around Europe would ultimately undermine NATO's effectiveness.
Mr. Blair described the purpose of the rapid-reaction force quite narrowly. "This is in circumstances where NATO as a whole chooses not to be engaged," he said. "It is limited to the peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks that are set out. It is not a standing army." 
Mr. Blair insisted it could "strengthen NATO" by offering an alternative when "NATO doesn't want to be involved." He was referring to Bosnia- or Kosovo-style operations, which President Bush is clearly cautious about joining. Mr. Bush has talked about pulling American troops out of the Balkans, after consultations with NATO -- to the consternation of European officials. 
Mr. Bush said he had been assured "that NATO is going to be the primary way to keep the peace in Europe." 
In their discussions today, administration officials said, the two leaders took up the question of how to both narrow and strengthen the sanctions against Iraq -- a subject discussed during lunch with General Powell, who left hours later on his first trip to the Middle East as secretary of state. 
Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair offered no specifics of how the sanctions might be reconfigured. Mr. Bush fell back on precisely the same words he has used previously to describe the problem. "As you know I made the famous statement that our sanctions are like Swiss cheese," he said. "That means they're not very effective. And we're going to work together to figure out a way to make them more effective."
Mr. Blair took the subject a step further, saying that President Hussein should not interpret any eventual relaxation of some elements of the economic sanctions as weakness.
Mr. Bush leaped onto the point, saying "a change in sanctions should not in any way, shape or form, embolden Saddam Hussein. He has got to understand that we are going to watch him carefully and, if we catch him developing weapons of mass destruction, we'll take the appropriate action."

HEADLINE: Money Sought for Pilot Project To Improve Teacher Training 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Harold O. Levy and Matthew Goldstein, the chancellors of the New York City schools and of the City University of New York, have turned to Washington for help in creating a "Teacher Empowerment Zone" to improve teacher training. 
 Under the proposal, classrooms would have cameras so that teacher trainees could watch master teachers teach, and later talk to them about things like how they had tried to calm down an angry student or encourage a withdrawn one to take part. 
 Last week, Dr. Goldstein and Mr. Levy presented the idea to Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E. Schumer, and Representatives Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of Westchester, and Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of the Bronx. They plan to present the proposal to other Congressional representatives.
The chancellors are seeking about $15 million to pay for a pilot project, and are also trying to raise additional money from private foundations. 
The idea is for the schools in the empowerment zone to foster better teaching in the same way that economic empowerment zones use government money to stimulate business development.
Dr. Goldstein said that many young teachers dropped out after just a couple of years because they were "not ready for the culture of the classroom." The new plan, he said, would use classrooms led by master teachers to give prospective teachers more exposure to classroom life earlier in their training. He said it was not practical to send all trainees into real classrooms at the start of training.
Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said the proposal recognized "that current teachers can provide a tremendous amount of support and expertise for teacher trainees." While she supports the idea, she said, "clearly it is not a substitute for having a much more enriched teacher internship program."

HEADLINE: Michael Oksenberg, 62, China Expert in Washington 

BYLINE:  By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Michel Oksenberg, an American authority on China who as a member of President Jimmy Carter's National Security Council helped establish full diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing, died on Thursday at his home in Atherton, Calif. He was 62.
 The cause of death was cancer, his family said. 
 As the China expert on the Security Council from 1977 to 1980, Dr. Oksenberg played a crucial role in the negotiations that led to the start of full relations on Jan. 1, 1979. 
After President Richard M. Nixon's visit to Beijing in 1972, the United States and China agreed to set up liaison offices in each other's capitals, but not embassies, as the United States continued to recognize the Nationalist government on Taiwan. In early 1978, Dr. Oksenberg accompanied the national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, to Beijing, where, with the help of Leonard F. Woodcock, head of the liaison office there, they laid the groundwork for the full normalization of relations announced in December 1978.
The agreement involved severing full diplomatic relations with Taiwan by substituting a liaison office for the embassy in Taipei. Dr. Oksenberg helped negotiate an intelligence-sharing arrangement with the Chinese when China's top leader, Deng Xiaoping, visited Washington in early 1979.
In 1980, after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which Beijing and Washington strongly opposed, Dr. Oksenberg was involved in negotiating with China on helping the Afghan resistance movement. 
"Throughout all that period when relations with China were high on our agenda, Mike was my right hand," Dr. Brzezinski, now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said yesterday in a telephone interview.
At the end of last year, when his health was failing, Dr. Oksenberg helped mobilize opinion in the United States government against President Bill Clinton's expressed interest in trying to arrange a visit to North Korea. Mr. Clinton was hoping to announce an agreement to limit missile development and sales.
In a letter to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, Dr. Oksenberg cautioned that the United States should not appear overly eager to draw closer to North Korea and that a presidential visit there just before an election risked tying the hands of Mr. Clinton's successor in the White House.
The visit was not made, largely because the United States was unable to reach the understanding on missiles that Mr. Clinton had sought.
Born on Oct. 12, 1938, in Antwerp, Belgium, Dr. Oksenberg was the son of a diamond cutter. The family moved to the United States the next year. He earned a B.A. from Swarthmore College in 1960 and an M.A. in 1963 and a Ph.D. in political science in 1969 from Columbia University. He taught at Stanford University from 1966 to 1968, transferring to Columbia until 1974. He was also on the University of Michigan faculty from 1973 to 1992, taking a leave to work on the Security Council.
From 1992 to 1995, Dr. Oksenberg was president of the East-West Center, a federally financed research and training institute in Honolulu, before moving to the Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford.
In 1988, Dr. Oksenberg wrote "Policy Making in China: Leaders, Structures, and Processes" with Prof. Kenneth Lieberthal of the University of Michigan. The work argued that despite China's authoritarian reputation, its bureaucracy strove for internal consensus on major decisions. His other publications included "Shaping U.S.-China Relations: A Long-Term Strategy" (with Elizabeth Economy, 1997) and "China Joins the World: Progress and Prospects" (with Elizabeth Economy, co-editor, 1999).
Surviving are his wife, the former Lois Elinor Clarenbach; a son, Maj. David Oksenberg of the Army; and a daughter, Dr. Deborah Oksenberg, a physician in San Francisco.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Imaginative Leaps Into the Real World

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
IN architecture, it is always the Thirties. Buildings can never be entirely divorced from social reality, since they make up a good chunk of it. Nor can they be isolated from the world of ideas. They make up a hefty slice of the intellectual sphere as well. With luck, there will always be openings for those who wish to debate whether architecture is best seen as a form of art or one of social service.
 Edmund Wilson's idea of the triple thinker, a Thirties concept imported from literature, offers a useful way to look at the debate. First published in 1938, "The Triple Thinkers" set forth Wilson's ideal of the writer's relationship to society. The book, a collection of essays, reflected Wilson's disenchantment with Marxism as a way of reforming society or even adequately describing it. 
 Wilson's triple thinkers (they include Pushkin, James, Shaw and Flaubert, from whom Wilson borrowed the phrase) are unwilling to renounce responsibility either to themselves or to their society. They reject confinement in a private garden of self-cultivation and the frustration of political action. Instead, they seek meaning in the tensions between their inner and outer worlds. These tensions stimulate imaginative leaps into the triple thought: the work of art that functions as a moral guide. 
Art for art's sake. Its antithesis (the double thought) is the dedication of art to social reform. The triple thought is the realization that beauty is not some transcendant, eternal abstraction but something that arises from historical circumstances and that can enlarge the historical awareness of an audience. 
What brought Wilson's idea up again for me is the recent announcement that the Whitney Museum of American Art has hired Rem Koolhaas to work on a vision plan for the museum's future development. This is the second important commission Koolhaas has received in New York in recent months. He is already working on a plan, which will include a new building, for the cultural district now being developed in Brooklyn by Harvey Lichtenstein, chairman of the Brooklyn Academy of Music Local Development Corporation. Along with Frank Gehry's design for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in lower Manhattan, these projects will raise New York architecture to a level that hasn't been seen since the 60's.
No one has done more to draw architecture back to the cultural arena than Gehry and Koolhaas. The concept of the triple thinker helps explain why. The forthcoming projects by these architects will be art works for the public exhibition of art works. They will not help house the homeless. They may even drive up rents. But as practitioners of triple thinking, these two architects have demonstrated how the art of building can be a morally illuminating act.
Koolhaas and Gehry are both poets. The sources of their lyric gifts are unknowable. Still, when their work is set against the field of architecture today, some qualities stand out. Both, for example, have powerfully ambivalent attitudes toward authority. With Gehry, it comes from the tradition of the modern artist, with Koolhaas from the counterculture of the 60's, but the two have ended up with the same confidence in the architect's expertise.
In an interview more than 30 years ago, Gehry said: "Our architectural vocabulary is better than our clients'; our visual intellect is more highly evolved; we are the experts and that is why we are hired. I want to provide services at the highest possible level, and to do so I have to deal with the real issues, the clearest statement of the problem uncluttered by 'How was it done before?' or 'Give them what they want' hang-ups."
These hang-ups signify social as well as architectural norms. Gehry's great gift is to present aesthetic disobedience and urban disturbance as pure exercises in social responsibility. His irregular forms evoke the heated discussion between self and society. Often, his imaginative process resembles an exchange between a piece of modern sculpture (de Kooning's "Clam Digger," say, or Brancusi's "Kiss") and the rusted remains of the 19th century industrial city as it morphs into the global cultural marketplace of the 21st.
The sculpture is a sign of subjective perception. The city stands for objective fact. Gehry's expertise is to mediate between these two conditions. Robert Rauschenberg's famous description of himself as someone who works in the space between art and life helps explain the importance this American artist has long held for Gehry. Both negotiate deals for space between imperfect selves and flawed social worlds. These spaces are dedicated to the idea of transforming both self and society.
All great modern building -- from the individual monument to the vernacular urban ensemble -- is the product of triple thinking. If that's an overstatement, it's still as reliable a criterion as any I can think of.
Our time is rich in triple architecture. James Ingo Freed's United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington is a masterpiece of the genre. So is Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown have been triple thinking for 40 years. Projects by Jean Nouvel, Philippe Starck, Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, Daniel Libeskind, Peter Eisenman, Thom Mayne, Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos, and other members of the so-called avant-garde, should also be seen as expressive interactions between the architect's creative process and his or her social contract.
As these examples indicate, triple thinking does not produce a particular set of forms or a recognizable style. What it produces is a way of thinking about relationships, on the social and the artistic plane. What it produces is disturbance. 
Rem Koolhaas is the most verbally articulate triple thinker in architecture today. A book, not a building, established his reputation, the so-called retroactive manifesto of 1994, "Delirious New York." The book's title fused the two halves of his dialectic. New York is the capital of advanced capitalism. In the absence of a superior analytic tool, the city demands a Marxian interpretation. Delirium, a mental disorder, invites a Freudian reading. These two schools of thought place Koolhaas on a Surrealist playing field. Most architectural games are played on this field today, in fact, even those acted out in ignorance of the boundaries. And, like some Surrealist painters, Koolhaas has the genius to make us forget where we are and know where we are at the same time. We're at once inside our minds and in a post-cold war world, and both of these places have been damaged by history.
The Freudian history is personal, the Marxian history is social, but in both instances a diagnosis is called for. It often seems to me that the architect's task today is to shape spaces that don't make the world more diseased than it is. Koolhaas is a diagnostician who presents his findings in architectural relationships. His rendering of analysis into sensuous form gives these buildings their startlingly immediate sense of life.
Koolhaas's work has long revolved around a dialogue between Europe and the United States. In the early years, it resembled a mid-Atlantic exchange between Mies van der Rohe and Wallace K. Harrison. Mies made light, precise, rational, reductive envelopes of space. Harrison embodied grand, iconic, theatrical gestures, like the United Nations Headquarters and the Trylon and Perisphere at the 1939 New York World's Fair. From these two figures, Koolhaas fashioned a vocabulary of spirals and grids that still informs his designs.
His house for a family in Bordeaux, for instance, is approached by a concrete driveway in the shape of a spiral. The house itself is a rethought, three-story version of Mies's Farnsworth House. The rear wall is punctured with round port-hole windows that recall Harrison's control tower at La Guardia Airport.
New York is no longer the standard bearer of liberal conscience that it was for most of the 20th century. No single art work is going to change this. But imperfect social relationships are the content of the triple thinker's art.
IN his study project for the Museum of Modern Art's 1997 competition to redesign its midtown campus, Koolhaas took circulation as his organizing idea. Using the new Odyssey escalator technology developed by Otis, he proposed a system for moving stairs, platforms and rooms vertically and diagonally through interior space.
He also excised the ground floor from the existing museum, creating a slab that floated over an outdoor space extending from 52nd to 53rd Streets, allowing the city to penetrate the museum envelope. Thus, the design linked the mechanized vertical transport to New York's great horizontal public space, the street.
Koolhaas's notes for the project, which have been privately published, show that he began working out these spatial relationships before arriving at the visual forms of buildings. His goal was to weaken the existing boundaries between private (the museum) and public space (the street). His design resumed the modern task of relaxing the conventions of social and psychological encounter.
You will not need "Das Kapital" or "The Interpretation of Dreams" to find your way around Koolhaas's vision plan for the Whitney. Koolhaas excels in conveying the idea that architecture is an art of organizing urban relationships, not the styling of discrete objects in space. Whether as journalist, screenwriter, teacher or architect, he has done nothing all his life but study the differences between cities, the extent to which it is in their nature to grow and the role architects play in its unfolding. That is his area of expertise.
Yours, too, perhaps. You are invited to assign your own voices to the spatial and formal sequences Koolhaas devises. In fact, as in a classical course of psychoanalysis, you are expected to do so.
But Americans get spooked when people refer to Marx and Freud in a positive light. This is one of the joys of mentioning them. Freud and Marx! Marx and Freud! Trick or Treat! In our public discourse, one stands for the gulag and nuclear warfare, the other for quackery and the insanity defense. They're unwelcome reminders of imperfection on the golden field of success.
I see no cultural advantage in dismissing the schools of thought initiated by these thinkers. As scientific systems, political parties, substitute religions and sources of illustrational art, they're silly or worse. But they continue to provide useful techniques for describing certain features of historical continuity. Along with the continuing debates over their ideas, Marx and Freud still figure in the cultural landscape where European architects build.
Our dismissal of them, in fact, supports the view, advanced by the London School of Economics professor John Gray, that the United States can no longer be regarded as a Western country. We've rejected the modern tradition of self-examination that holds Western societies together. It is as if freedom, equality, accountability and other strands of social tissue have frayed beyond repair. Or, as some have put it, the United States didn't win the cold war. We were just the second to lose it. Instead of mass famine, we've got reality TV.

HEADLINE: SPRING THEATER; 
How Karaoke Conquered Broadway

BYLINE:  By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
Go ahead. Pick up the microphone. You know you want to. What difference does it make if you can't sing? Or dance? Or act? We're all friends here. Everybody loves you. Anyway, it's only Broadway.
 WHEN Rosie O'Donnell recently stepped into "Seussical" -- the financially struggling, critically dissed Broadway musical -- for a limited run, she was officially portraying a creature called the Cat in the Hat. 
 It is true that she wore that preposterously tall, striped stovepipe that is the signature of Dr. Seuss' troublemaking feline. But there was no doubt in anyone's mind that the character Ms. O'Donnell was really playing was everybody's Rosie, the popular talk-show host, sometime actress and stand-up comic regarded by much of the United States as an intimate acquaintance. 
For those who had watched Ms. O'Donnell on television that morning, the effect of her entrance in "Seussical" -- in which she hovered like a beaming bull's-eye in a Technicolor target of a drop curtain -- must have been like finding someone you had gossiped with during breakfast suddenly ruling over a flashy personal playground that just happened to be a big Broadway theater.
"Did you ever imagine you would see me on a stage?" asked Ms. O'Donnell, and the audience roared. For the record, when that line was spoken by the show's original Cat, David Shiner (who conveniently left for a vacation a month after the production opened), it didn't get anything like the same response.
There was, after all, something so vicariously satisfying in the very sight of Ms. O'Donnell, whether she was standing still while she flicked her fingers in rhythm to the people dancing around her or (in some Act II ad-libbing) rattling on about her kids just as she does on television. If good old Rosie, whose singing voice is only average and dancing skills dubious, could star in a Broadway musical, why not you or me?
Ms. O'Donnell is the uncrowned but undisputed queen of what has become the biggest little karaoke bar in the country, an area otherwise known as Broadway. She is its pre-eminent karaoke artist, the ordinary gal with the chutzpah to get up there and perform, and its foremost promoter.
Indeed, she is a tireless cheerleader for Broadway on television and has probably done more to bring mainstream audiences to New York theater than any other individual. And once she starred in the revival of "Grease!" in 1994, she helped open the doors for a new breed of Broadway stars. For such luminaries, performance skills are of less significance than Q ratings. And they reign over a world in which the currency of celebrity, far more versatile than the euro, can be cashed in in almost any field. (Don't forget that Ms. O'Donnell, like Oprah Winfrey, is now the figurehead of an eponymous women's magazine.)
It says much that in the Playbills that were distributed at the performances in which Ms. O'Donnell appeared, you could flip to the alphabetized ads and find, above the listing for "Seussical," the following blurb: " 'Absolutely amazing, I loved it!' -- Rosie O'Donnell, 'The Rosie O'Donnell Show.' " More significantly, Ms. O'Donnell represents a sea change in the nature of Broadway stardom, which is now less a celebration of the inimitable, highly skilled artist than of the interchangeable everyperson. Having formed her professional identity as a fan for all seasons, Ms. O'Donnell still exudes the gosh-gee enthusiasm of the stage-struck girl from Long Island who grew up chirping along with records of show tunes. You can imagine her lip-synching to "Funny Girl" or "Hello, Dolly!" in front of the mirror.
And it is still that girl before the mirror whom you see when Ms. O'Donnell is onstage. Never mind that as the Cat in the Hat she is giving essentially the same performance she gave when she played Rizzo, the class bad girl at Rydell High, in "Grease!" The deadpan New York drawl, straight-backed strut, what-me-worry facial expressions: they're all the same. The point is that she seems so happy up there, as if to say, "Look at me! I'm on Broadway, everybody! Don't you want to try it, too?"
The ancient art of karaoke, in which your average schmo in a bar stands up to sing familiar songs to prerecorded instrumental tracks, dates back many millennia -- well, at least a few decades, when it caught on big in Japan. In the United States, where it washed ashore in the 1980's, karaoke has been around long enough to zoom in and out of fashion and, going the way of all flash in this age of recycling, to be reborn as an ironically hip entertainment in fleetingly fashionable nightclubs, like Moomba in Manhattan.
No matter what its actual cool status, karaoke remains a perfect cultural metaphor for this country at the turn of the century, a time that emphasizes the pursuit of fabulous fame as a constitutional right. It's the implicit premise of all those "reality" shows on television, which can transform a corpulent corporate consultant into a People cover boy.
The same sensibility comes across in the "behind the scenes" magazine and television stories that regularly anatomize the creation of starry images. Old Hollywood took infinite pains to present its celluloid deities with their masks carefully painted and in place.
Today, a teenager can watch not only the latest music video about her favorite cute-guy group but also the documentaries about how the video was made and even how the group itself was manufactured. Celebrity-worshiping magazines often have footnote features explaining the styling (a word that assumed new significance from the 1980's on) that transformed the celebrity in question into an exotic cover icon. It's a process that is replicated for less illustrious folk on television shows like "Fashion Emergency."
Of course, not everyone with good hair highlights and the perfect leather jacket becomes an entertainment idol. If the camera doesn't love you, you're not going to become a movie star, even if Tom Ford is designing your wardrobe. On the other hand, you might try your luck in a Broadway musical, which has become a remarkably accepting platform for the marginally talented.
What's more, many of the recent high-profile shows ("Footloose," "Saturday Night Fever," "The Rocky Horror Show") have been worked around rehashes of familiar numbers that you might already have sung on a karaoke stage. Then there is that popular karaoke trick of doing a dead-on imitation of the person who first made your songs famous. Witness Craig Bierko's eerie channeling of Robert Preston in "The Music Man." Originality, it seems, is hardly at a premium.
The old Broadway insisted that its stars have that extra something -- in both presence and sheer talent -- that was so extreme, in many instances, that it bordered on the freakish. Hollywood, accordingly, was never very hospitable to Ethel Merman, Gwen Verdon or Carol Channing, women whose real electricity became apparent only when they sang or danced in live performance. Obese, grimacing Zero Mostel and hyperslick, silver-tongued Robert Preston never ruled the screen the way they did the stage.
Even all-American, plain-pretty Mary Martin never got the career in movies she longed for. Her magic seemed to evaporate without footlights and a live orchestra. In the film version of the show that secured her stardom, "One Touch of Venus," the part of the goddess went to Ava Gardner, whose singing voice had to be dubbed.
Musical comedy stars were like opera stars, in a way: their sex appeal and their character came from how they mated with music. Even if their voices (like Ms. Channing's or Mostel's) were hardly pretty by conventional standards, they were able to make song sound like a privileged extension of speech, with even greater possibilities for expressiveness.
It's a gift that Barbara Cook, the ultimate Broadway ingenue of the 1950's and current cabaret idol, showed she still has in her recent concert at Carnegie Hall, at which you could not only hear every word she sang but understand what she meant by it. (Compare this approach to a song with that of Linda Eder, star of the late "Jekyll and Hyde" on Broadway, in which meaning is secondary to flashy "Star Search"-style pyrotechnics.)
You get the same sense of spontaneity achieved through precise technique in Bebe Neuwirth's elegant, hieroglyphically angled dancing in "Chicago," the long-running revival to which she has returned for a short rejuvenating visit. Ms. Neuwirth still turns the show's cool Brechtian irony into four-alarm heat.
In a more sentimental but equally compelling vein, there's the country singer Reba McEntire, now making a spectacular Broadway debut in the revival of "Annie Get Your Gun." Her miraculously felt performance makes you think that of all the musical genres popular today, country -- with its emphasis on narrative and emotion-parsing lyrics -- may be the closest kin to traditional Broadway fare.
These women are exceptions, however. It is telling that the current edition of "Forbidden Broadway," the ever-acute satiric revue created by Gerard Alessandrini, has to reach backward to find figures with stage identities large enough to satirize: Merman, of course, and veterans like Patti LuPone and Liza Minnelli. Among the new crop of performers, only Heather Headley, the vibrant Tony winner of "Aida," has a personal style distinct enough to be easily parodied.
Even such appealing marquee-toppers as Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie, who created the leads in the hit revival of "Kiss Me, Kate," have yet to develop presences that make them the natural subjects of immortalizing caricature, whether by Mr. Alessandrini or Al Hirschfeld. As their parodied selves sing (to the tune of "Wunderbar") in "Forbidden Broadway," they remain fixedly "would-be stars."
A lot of this has to do with the paucity of new musicals that would allow performers first ownership rights to memorable roles. (Being in a revival like "Annie Get Your Gun" or "Cabaret" means wrestling with the ghosts of your predecessors.) Only Audra McDonald, of "Ragtime" and "Marie Christine," has achieved a secure identity as an interpreter of the new generation of moodier musical composers like Michael John LaChiusa and Ricky Ian Gordon. Small wonder that performers who seem born for musicals, like Donna Murphy and Kristin Chenoweth, wind up instead in television sitcoms.
There is also the unpleasant but inarguable fact that technological progress, the great god of the global community, is no friend to the Broadway musical. Labor-saving devices, after all, tend to dilute the impact of an art form whose appeal rests on the expenditure of human energy. Spectacular, hydraulically powered scenery has a way of shrinking the performers who stand before it. And head mikes, in addition to looking like distracting cybermoles on their wearers, homogenize and distance voices.
Artificial amplification, of course, is part of what has allowed performers not trained in musicals to appear on Broadway stages. It's the technical part of the karaoke equation. No matter how faint or jagged your voice is, there will be a machine to enhance and, to some degree, smoothen it. Hence the Broadway debuts of television-bred icons like the former Charlie's Angel Cheryl Ladd (Ms. McEntire's predecessor in "Annie") and the "Baywatch" stud David Hasselhoff (seen in the last weeks of "Jekyll and Hyde").
The energetic, P. T. Barnum-ish producers Fran and Barry Weissler, of "Seussical" infamy, have become the ultimate practitioners of the pick-a-star-any-star formula. Their revival of "Grease!" turned into a revolving door through which fumbled a succession of celebrities in career limbo, from Brooke Shields to Maureen McCormick of "The Brady Bunch."
The exploitation in live theater of those famous in other fields isn't new, of course. The showgirl Evelyn Nesbit's career got a serious, uh, shot in the arm after her husband, Harry K. Thaw, fatally wounded Stanford White. Marla Maples landed a plum role in the "The Will Rogers Follies" after figuring in tabloid melodramas as the other woman in Donald Trump's life. The very plot of "Chicago" hinges on turning notoriety into theatrical celebrity.
The current lowering of the talent bar doesn't apply exclusively to the famous and infamous. The karaoke influence shows up even in productions without recognizable names on the marquee. It is, in fact, really dispiriting when an unknown is given a chance to carry a show and still registers as a cipher. The ill-advised Broadway versions of "Footloose" and "Saturday Night Fever" were inspired by movies that celebrated dancing. Yet their leading men -- Jeremy Kushnier and James Carpinello, respectively -- had little kinetic charisma. They weren't even the best dancers in their shows. It was as if the producers had wanted only to provide theme-park-like mnemonic triggers, letting theatergoers fill in the life-giving detail with their memories of the original movies. And again, perhaps the very ordinariness of the central performers let audience members feel a part of things, as if they might run up on stage and join in.
This, for the record, is exactly what happens in the current "Rocky Horror Show," another production trading brazenly on the popularity of a cult movie. The paid performers painstakingly re-enact the events and numbers made famous in midnight showings of the film. But it is the response of the cultists in the audience, who recite and sing along with the people onstage, that creates the only show worth watching in the Circle in the Square Theater.
Two new musicals, and they may be harbingers of others, ingeniously incorporate the karaoke idea into the texture of the show itself: "The Full Monty," which follows the transformation of a group of unemployed blue-collar lugs into dancing strippers, and the Broadway-bound London hit "Mamma Mia!," in which an amateur girl group of the 1970's reunites to perform the disco-era hits of Abba, the Swedish pop group.
The ostensible klutziness of the performers here is part of their characters. They are doing astutely professional, and often quite charming, renderings of nonprofessional awkwardness. Ineptitude, for once, is an artistic choice.
These shows are about all that can be offered as evidence of an upside to the karaokization of Broadway. In the meantime, it is worth noting that the program cover for "Seussical," which originally featured what looked like Mr. Shiner's striped-hatted forehead rising from a manhole, now shows only an anonymous arm brandishing the same hat. Who, indeed, will be the next Cat to crawl into view? Richard Hatch? Monica Lewinsky? Marc Rich? Hey, why not you?

Forget Voting Them Off the Island. They're Just Shot.

BYLINE:  By JAMIE MALANOWSKI; Jamie Malanowski's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about the comedian and actor Chris Rock.

 BODY:
TALK about timing. A smorgasbord of reality programs is being presented on the big 100-channel buffet, and the post-Super Bowl premiere of "Survivor II" racked up the season's highest rating for an entertainment show.
 Into this embracing environment comes "Series 7," a movie opening Friday that consists wholly of six back-to-back episodes from the seventh series of an imaginary hit tabloid television show called "The Contenders." Fortunately, the film has more going for it than timing. 
 Conceived and shot in the heyday of relatively low-concept reality shows like "The Real World" on MTV and "Cops" on Fox, in which the subjects' circumstances are only minimally contrived, "Series 7" anticipates the current wave of higher-concept shows like "Survivor" and "The Mole" and "Temptation Island," in which people are plopped into elaborate petri dishes and asked to seem natural while skydiving, eating bugs and fomenting betrayal. 
Indeed, "Series 7" not only anticipates these shows; it skips ahead to portray the most cynical contrivance of all. In "The Contenders," a handful of ordinary people in an ordinary town -- in this case, Danbury, Conn., masquerading under a stage name, Newbury -- are given handguns and pitted against one another until there is only one survivor. (And they mean survivor; the losers don't show up later grousing to David Letterman.)
It's a satire, smart and funny, but as Daniel Minahan, the film's 37-year-old writer and director calmly acknowledges, it's not a nice movie. "The movie keeps you off balance," he said recently in New York. "The audience wants to laugh, but it's not sure, so there's a kind of uncomfortable laughter first, and then there's this real laughter. The movie shames you and pokes you even while it amuses you."
One delight of "Series 7" is the way it perfectly mimics the visual grammar of tabloid TV -- the quick cuts, the mix of emotional commentary and you-are-there action, the pedal-to-the-metal pursuit of anything that whiffs of dramatic possibility. It's no surprise that after producing documentaries at the Kitchen, an arts center in Manhattan, and news programming at the BBC in London (where he met a fellow filmmaker, Mary Harron, with whom he co-wrote the screenplay of the 1996 indie success, "I Shot Andy Warhol"), Mr. Minahan spent two years working on tabloid shows at the Fox network. The guiding principle there, he recalled, was "economy, economy, economy.
"You never stop telling the story," he said. "The funniest thing I remember from the experience is the executive producers coming in and looking at a piece I was working on and saying, 'That's great -- now take out all the pauses.' 
"I always felt like I was a spy when I worked there," Mr. Minahan said. "I had the idea for 'Series 7,' and I was always getting ideas, tucking away little bits to use in the film."
The economy Mr. Minahan learned in Fox's cutting rooms rules the movie. There are no artful or leisurely setups explaining the premise -- immediately they're recapping the last kill of Dawn, the angry, 8-months-pregnant defending champion and killer of 10, played by Brooke Smith ("The Silence of the Lambs," "Vanya on 42nd Street"). The horrified new contestants are handed their guns. No explanation is provided, nor do they seem to need one.
"We talked about this a lot," Mr. Minahan said of the film's narrative strategy. "The more we explained the rules, the more questions that were asked and answered, the less the conceit held up. So we made it that the show was this thing that was in the consciousness of people, a game, and that everybody knew what it meant when you said 'I'm a Contender.' "
This recognition -- that veteran channel-surfers would be sufficiently steeped in the vocabulary of TV to grasp the story -- was the key to pulling "Series 7" off. It was, however, a realization that took some time coming. 
"Originally Daniel set it up as a show within a show, as a TV program within a movie," said Jason Kliot of Blow Up Pictures, a producer of the film, "but it kind of bogged down over the question of how you show the difference between what's the TV show and what's the movie. Finally we suggested to him that he just never leave the show. Make it like 'War of the Worlds,' and never leave the construct. And after we suggested that, you could see this almost electric transformation in Daniel, and he went off and rewrote the entire script." 
The performances Mr. Minahan got from his actors also serve the conceit extremely well. "Dawn is a character who is at once very fierce and very vulnerable, and Brooke had those qualities," he said. "Of all the things in 'Silence of the Lambs,' I remember her performance best, because it was so shocking, so stripped bare. She was the girl in the pit. She totally knew how to go to that place."
Ms. Smith said: "It was interesting working with Dan because we knew he wanted this nonacting thing in our performances. But at the same time, he would show us episodes of 'Cops,' and he would point out how the people on the show, the people on the screen, were in fact acting. Because a camera was on them, they changed. They started to act for the camera. There was one episode, the police were arresting a drunk guy. His friend came over to help, and a police officer pushed him out of the frame. Not out of the way of the arrest, out of the frame of the camera."
Mr. Minihan recalled, "I had to remind the actors that the cameraman was a character in the film. Film actors are taught not to look at the camera, but these characters needed to show an awareness that the camera was in the room and that everything was being witnessed by someone. That really changed the performances. And I would use that. Two characters would be playing a moment where they were discussing a secret, and I would tell the cinematographer to go in closer. The proximity of the camera, the invasion of privacy, completely changed the tone of the performance."
Mr. Minahan said he was particularly pleased with the performance of the actress who played the mother of a teenage contender, a woman who knows a thing or two about cameras and invasions of privacy, Donna Hanover, the estranged wife of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York.
"She was really good at it," Mr. Minahan said. "She and another character would be having a private moment, and I would remind her that the camera was there, and she would glare right at it."
In directing "Series 7," Mr. Minahan had to undergo the usual rigors of directing a low-budget feature ("We got permission to shoot at a Qwik Mart in Danbury," Ms. Smith recalled, "but the Qwik Mart wouldn't close. We had customers coming in, stepping over a body, and saying 'Gimme $10 on Pump No. 2"). But he also had to serve another, very subtle, function for the film. As Joana Vicente, a partner in Blow Up Films, put it: "Daniel had to be the network, And of course, the network is the villain."
N ONE of the characters are villains," Mr. Minahan said. "The real villain is the producer who pushes people into these terrible situations. My model for 'The Contenders' were shows like 'Cops' or 'The Real World,' which are mean shows. The invasion of privacy in 'Cops' is a violent act. There's a tendency in 'The Real World' towards humiliation, towards ostracizing the person you don't like. 'Survivor' and 'Big Brother' are completely mean-spirited, all about singling out the person the group hates. And now there's 'The Mole,' where there's a spy in the group. To me that's completely antisocial, and it's because the producers want it that way.
"It's interesting that these shows have chosen to be about mistrust and hatred," he added. "They could easily all be the other way around. They could all be about people trying to work together."

HEADLINE: SPRING THEATER/LIFE AND ART; 
The Timeless Dance Of Art and Money Takes Center Stage

BYLINE:  By CELIA WREN; Celia Wren is the managing editor of American Theater magazine.

 BODY:
THERE must be a cost!" Benvenuto Cellini cries to his benefactor, the Duke of Florence, in John Patrick Shanley's new play, "Cellini," about the 16th-century Florentine sculptor. A study of the creative temperament, "Cellini" resounds with thematically freighted artist-patron squabbles. In the interest of holding down expenses on a bronze statue of Perseus, the Duke -- a member of Florence's Medici family, noted for supporting the arts -- suggests eliminating one component: the body of the slain Medusa, on which Perseus stands. 
 But that idea is anathema to Cellini, for whom the pairing of hero and monster represents all the yins and yangs of the creative process: control and freedom, impulse and tenacity, ecstasy and pain. Gain and sacrifice, too, of course -- metaphorical, but also monetary: before Cellini's bronze masterpiece emerges from the furnace (represented in the production by a scaffold, a bright light and a sheet), the Duke must fork over a significant amount of cash. 
 Even at its most sublime, art rubs shoulders with filthy lucre, as "Cellini" and a host of other dramas remind us this season. Indeed, if you favor plays that might spark a brawl at an auction house, this may be your year. 
In New York, Mr. Shanley's play, inspired by Cellini's autobiography and directed by the playwright, runs at Second Stage through next Sunday.
Jumping forward a couple of centuries, Jon Robin Baitz's newest work, "Ten Unknowns," about a world-weary painter who catches the eye of a greedy art dealer in the early 1990's, opens March 8 under the direction of Daniel Sullivan at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center. 
Yasmina Reza's international hit "Art," about three male friends who quarrel after one of them purchases an all-white painting, will be mounted at no fewer than 30 nonprofit theaters across America this season, according to American Theater magazine.
In California, a play about John Ruskin, seen at South Coast Repertory in December, will be mounted at the Globe Theaters in San Diego beginning in March. The play, "The Countess," by Gregory Murphy, about the Victorian art critic who championed the Pre-Raphaelites and, later in his life, railed against laissez-faire economics, was an Off Broadway sleeper that closed last year after more than 600 performances. It is currently being turned into a film.
If you count plays that by dint of their very subject matter might be said to challenge assumptions about art and value, the total rises. Opening at the Actors Theater of Louisville on March 23 as part of the annual Humana Festival of new plays is Charles Mee's "Bobrauschenbergamerica," a fantasia inspired by Robert Rauschenberg, who incorporated items like a stuffed hen and a scavenged ventilation duct into his found-object "combines."
And the music-theater piece "Jennie Richee," written by the playwright Mac Wellman with a score by Julia Wolfe, had its world premiere earlier this month at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. (The production will visit the Kitchen in New York in April.) The work portrays the outsider artist Henry Darger, whose watercolors and collages, discovered amid hundreds of empty Pepto-Bismol bottles after his death, now sell for up to $100,000 each.
A few of these plays take frank stock of the tension-fraught relationship between art and money: "You haven't bought this painting for 200,000 francs?" expostulates the shocked philistine Marc in "Art." Others -- like "The Countess," with its barbed portrait of Ruskin the tastemaker -- reflect on the preconceptions that may make viewers less likely to admire (read: buy) a certain work.
More profoundly, the plays explore aesthetic, philosophical and social questions. What makes art authentic? Do patrons and price tags inevitably compromise a creator's vision? Does a painting have inherent value -- even if it is all white and looks just plain blank? Or is value a market-conjured mirage? Is the connoisseur who hands over a wad of cash for a canvas -- or a Broadway ticket, for that matter -- just a gullible snob, "dazzled by what he believes to be culture," as Marc scoffs in "Art," the Tony-winning comedy of ideas?
The theater's scrutiny of such matters may relate to the notable buoyancy of the art market in recent years, says Malcolm Goldstein, who has written books on American drama and just published "Landscape With Figures: A History of Art Dealing in the United States" (Oxford University Press). He points out that detective novels about art theft and fraud have also proliferated of late, a trend he attributes to impressive auction prices splashed across the headlines. "When people see those figures in the newspapers, they become fascinated," he said.
"Appalled" might be a more accurate word, to judge by popular culture's frequent depiction of art dealers and connoisseurs as pretentious mercenaries who race after fashionable trends. A telling piece of conceptual art spelled out this attitude in pink lights in Timberlake Wertenbaker's "Three Birds Alighting on a Field," which played at the Manhattan Theater Club in New York in 1994. "ART IS MONEY-SEXY-SOCIAL-CLIMBING-FANTASTIC," it said. 
Speaking by telephone from London recently, Ms. Wertenbaker said that the play, which contrasts a cynical gallery owner with an idealistic painter, was inspired by the skyrocketing art prices of the late 80's. To her at that time, she recalled, "The art market represented something about society -- that things have no value except when attached to a price." Nevertheless, art remains "humanizing and enriching," even in the temple of Mammon, she said, adding, "Art can -- you hope it can! -- survive the marketplace."
This season Mr. Baitz strikes a few of the same notes in "Ten Unknowns," whose plot pivots on the way artistic movements eclipse one another in popularity. In the play, Malcolm Raphelson (played by Donald Sutherland), a bitter 72-year-old figurative painter, must confront terrifying questions about his own motives and talents when he finds himself in vogue, several decades after being thrust into obscurity by the Abstract Expressionists.
"Ten Unknowns," Mr. Baitz said just before a rehearsal, echoes some of his own ambivalent feelings about modern-day America and the theater's rivalry with film, television and popular culture. While cautioning that the play is about more than art -- it is also about relationships and endurance and aging -- Mr. Baitz allowed that Raphelson's resentment of Abstract Expressionism reflected his own "sense of being part of a form that's been blotted out by the electronic."
Most playwrights, Mr. Baitz said, tend to feel they are "doing something very small and out of step -- which I don't mind; out of step doesn't mean unnecessary to me."
Being in step, by contrast, means marching in sync with commercialism. "There's a world pressing in on the world of the play, and it's the world of merchandising," Mr. Baitz said. "I do have a sense that the culture has succumbed to salesmanship entirely."
Artistic integrity, he suggested, is particularly vulnerable in a greenback-fixated environment pulsing with questions like: "What is the photo op? What are the market conditions? What are the numbers? What is the zeitgeist doing now? What little twist will pique the curiosity of a ravenous consumer body?"
"I think you're sunk, obviously, if you're hypnotized by that," Mr. Baitz said. "For me, art comes out of grief and exaltation and rage. It doesn't come out of being smart or hip."
But if Raphelson is "a self-portrait to some extent," Mr. Baitz said, so too is the play's art dealer, Fabricant, whose "not particularly competent attempt at self-promotion reminds me of a failing version of myself."
Other playwrights have similarly used the art market theme as a way to address self-doubt. "Artists often have this question about their own fraudulence," said Brad Rosenstein, whose "Vermeer Room," a play about an art dealer in 1945 Amsterdam based on a historic forgery case, won the National Repertory Theater Foundation's National Play Award last year and was presented at the foundation's festival in Los Angeles in November. The scenario, he said, allowed him to dramatize such misgivings, while questioning "what is real, what is fake, what we value in art and in human beings, and how we make those judgments about things we prize."
ANGST also lurks behind the brush strokes in "Sight Unseen," the 1991 play by Donald Margulies, whose "Dinner With Friends" won a Pulitzer Prize last year. Mr. Margulies said that by centering "Sight Unseen" on an acclaimed but troubled painter named Jonathan Waxman, he was able to underscore the play's broader concerns with "lost values and compromise."
Gallery and atelier trappings, easels and pretentious critics deck out "Sight Unseen," but Mr. Margulies said he was more interested in Waxman as "a lapsed Jew who had assimilated into mainstream culture at the same time that he was being embraced on a large scale in his profession -- the compromise that entails, the feelings of emptiness and fraudulence."
Why is the museum and gallery world a magnet for playwrights musing about the genuine? Reality, after all, teems with confidence games and dubious vendibles, from dot-com stocks to black-market caviar. The playwright Michael Frayn, the author of "Copenhagen," whose recent novel "Headlong" depicts a hoax involving Bruegel paintings, pointed to the "interesting questions raised by the uniqueness of works of art."
We treasure paintings and sculpture, he said, because "we need to have repositories of value." That symbolism becomes all the starker, he said, to the extent that in the art world "originals are extremely valuable and even extremely good copies have almost no value at all."
Concern with value, in all its subtleties, lies at the root of the public's fascination with the art world, said the gallery owner Mary Boone. In the case of a painting, she said: "The thing that defines the difference in price is quality. How do you define that quality? It's not size or weight or the amount of money. It's about the reputation of the artist, and that's mysterious to people."
While it is intensely competitive, she added: "The art world in general is not as trend-fixated or money-fixated as the media makes it appear. This misconception rests on the media's habit of using price as shorthand for quality. To try to describe why the art of Jasper Johns or Jackson Pollock is considered great is very elusive. The simplest way of distilling all this information is dollars and cents."
Mr. Wellman, the author of "Jennie Richee," said he saw a connection between the current batch of art-themed plays and theater's relation with the press.
"Theater is in a state of despair," said Mr. Wellman, who takes a dim view of the field's reliance (as he sees it) on facile middlebrow fare. "It doubts its purpose," he said, "because for decades it's been trying to function journalistically. There are 'hot topics' determined by journalism in a stricter way than has ever happened before." Stranded at this impasse, he suggested, people in the theater have begun looking for inspiration to "other arts and how they function." Mr. Wellman mentioned last season's crop of plays with themes involving mathematics and science as an example of this phenomenon.
John Patrick Shanley has a less gloomy take on the theater's scrutiny of the art world and art-world finance. "Part of playwriting," he observes, "is about tricking yourself into thinking that you're not writing about yourself." Not only did he identify with Cellini's struggle to "express something inward in an outward art," he also saw parallels between Renaissance-era artist-patron rapport and partnerships in modern American theater and film.
"There are things in this play about my relationship with Joe Papp, Lynne Meadow, Steven Spielberg," he confessed, listing impresarios (from the Public Theater, Manhattan Theater Club and Hollywood, respectively) with whom he has collaborated. 
When it comes to the purse-string holder, Mr. Shanley added, the artist's question is usually, "Why can't he just give me the money and leave me alone?" But the subsequent give and take, he said, resembles the dialectic Cellini saw in Perseus and Medusa. "The struggle between those two opposing forces is the struggle between the patron and the artist, which can ultimately be a very fruitful friction," Mr. Shanley said. 
And when the friction between muse and money is not fruitful -- well, there is not much the artist can do about it.
"Hasn't it always been thus?" rejoined the playwright John Guare when asked if plays like "Cellini" and "Ten Unknowns" reflect widespread anxiety about art's niche in a commercial world. Mr. Guare -- who said he made an art dealer a central character in his 1990 play "Six Degrees of Separation" because "it's a real cutthroat world" -- theorized that "the minute art became a commodity for the grandeur of the patron, whether pope or Medici, it's always been, 'Who's going to get that commission? My palace is better than your palace!' "
And before the Medicis? "My cave is better than your cave!" Mr. Guare said.

HEADLINE: SPRING THEATER/A ROUNDTABLE; 
Talking Shop (Which Takes In the World)

 BODY:
 ON a Saturday morning last month, four playwrights whose work is being seen in Off Broadway theaters this year gathered at the Joseph Papp Public Theater to talk about their plays and, as it turned out, other subjects: Kia Corthron, 39, the author of "Force Continuum," which closes today at the Atlantic Theater Company, and "Breath, Boom," at Playwrights Horizons in May; Rebecca Gilman, 36, whose "Boy Gets Girl" runs through April 8 at the Manhattan Theater Club; Suzan-Lori Parks, 37, whose "Topdog/Underdog" will be at the Public Theater in July (Ms. Parks and Ms. Corthron also each have plays in the current "Urban Zulu Mambo" at the Signature Theater Company); and Kenneth Lonergan, 38, whose play "Lobby Hero" opens March 13 at Playwrights Horizons (and whose screenplay for the movie "You Can Count on Me," which he also directed, has been nominated for an Academy Award). The moderator was Pamela Renner, manager of editorial services at Variety in New York. Following are excerpts from the discussion. 

PAMELA RENNER: Has everyone been watching "N.Y.P.D. Blue" or is there something going on here? In three of your plays there are characters who are New York City police or security guards. Kia, your play, "Force Continuum," is about a Harlem family, three generations of cops----

KIA CORTHRON: Black cops.

RENNER: A black family who have made their lives in the force. In "Lobby Hero," your play, Ken, there are four characters: two of them are cops and two are security guards.

KENNETH LONERGAN: I just like blue.

RENNER: In Rebecca's play "Boy Gets Girl" there is a police officer who is the repository of experience. And interestingly, in Suzan-Lori's play there are two adult brothers who have no parents, and no police officers: a total absence of authority.

LONERGAN: Always swimming against the tide----

SUZAN-LORI PARKS: That's true. I heard you all were writing about the police so I went 180.

LONERGAN: I just wanted to write a cheap police melodrama. There is so much cop stuff on television that I get very nervous about saying words like alibi on a stage and having them sound cheesy. But real cops are kind of interesting, and real police issues are pretty interesting. I thought it might be kind of theatrical: uniforms with guns and sticks and stuff. I don't know. I don't watch those shows. Nothing against them, but I like "Larry Sanders."

REBECCA GILMAN: I don't know either. I've never seen "N.Y.P.D. Blue." But pragmatically the situations are going to be heightened, there's going to be more drama attached to them. And I have to tell you, for the sake of disclosure, that my newest play is about two cops. For me, when the police are involved it's usually because it's an extreme situation, and in extremity you have extreme conflict, and in conflict you have drama.

CORTHRON: I wrote my play because I'm a black woman living in Harlem, and there are issues all the time of black people and the police. It was somewhere between Louima and Diallo when I started writing it, and I said then I thought I'd address police brutality. It wasn't until we were close to production that I stopped saying that, because I felt it was not really what the play is about. It's part of it, but the play is about the relationship between the black community and the police.
Off the bat, I knew the main character was going to be a black cop, because it would be too easy for it to be a white cop, and I wanted to explore the complexity of the situation and its pressures. There's a line I have where the grandfather character says something like, "A black man in a police uniform -- it's like you're a black man in a Confederate uniform."
When I wrote this play the most important thing to me was not to say that there's a problem in this city with police brutality, because we know that. I talked with some cops and they actually feel there are ways out of this. Whatever I write, I hope there is hope at the end of the play, not just tragedy and devastation.

PARKS: I just write tragedy and devastation.

CORTHRON: I just want to stay off of Suzan-Lori's turf.

PARKS: Tragedy and devastation. It's like bleeding, like when they used to bleed folks. The play creates a wound that is actually the first stage in the healing process. So there are no cops in my play, there are just two people who can't get along.

RENNER: Rebecca, can we talk a little bit about your play and how you're using this policewoman, this figure of authority, who comes in both to give the main character comfort and to give her fear?

GILMAN: When I started the play I was reading a newspaper article specifically about women who were stalked by their policemen husbands and/or boyfriends or ex-husbands.

CORTHRON: That's the worst problem -- people you know.

GILMAN: Who are you going to ask for help in that situation? With the article was one of those public service pieces: "Things to do if you're being stalked." Since then, I've done research and gone to police departments, and there was always some printed-up pamphlet for this. And the suggestions were all so defensive and reactive and frightening. Yet it was presented so straightforwardly that I found that much more frightening than if there was something melodramatic about it.
With the police officer, I tried to incorporate that sense of business as usual as being a frightening thing. Sometimes the calmness doesn't always make you feel better. And so the officer who comes to talk to the main character, Theresa, is doing her best to alarm her to save her life, if that makes sense.

RENNER: Ken, your cops are not in such a tragic kind of situation -- they are dealing with a lot of messy human problems.

LONERGAN: I was interested in people's personal behavior versus what they expect of themselves professionally, and also what other people expect of them professionally. I had this idea of a young woman police officer who's trying very hard to be a police officer but she happens to fall in love with her partner. She doesn't want to be seen as a woman, she wants to be seen as a cop, but she's a human being and she falls in love. So which is she supposed to be?

RENNER: The people in these plays are not members of messy Eugene O'Neill families, drinking themselves to death, but are working in offices, in police training, in journalism or even in a shooting arcade dressed as Abraham Lincoln. Is there something that is interesting to you as writers in portraying people trying to hold down a job?

GILMAN: It's a big issue with me because I think -- especially in our country, the way the economics is evolving -- that people spend a huge amount of their life at work. I do tend to write about people who have work lives that are meaningful to them; in "Boy Gets Girl," Theresa is very invested in her work as a journalist.
But in reality I don't think that's the case. I think most people spend their time doing jobs that they hate and doing things that they hate and that they feel alienated by. When I look at the world now, I see people whose family life is impacted by work to the degree that a lot of them define their families as the people they work with. They spend so much time at work that they are disconnected from their immediate community.

CORTHRON: A lot of my plays involve teenagers, so there is no regular work life. But besides "Force Continuum," "Digging Eleven" -- it was done at Hartford Stage -- was about workers' rights in a factory and a strike in which two men -- friends and, though they keep it secret, lovers -- go separate ways politically.

PARKS: In "Topdog/Underdog" Lincoln works in a shooting gallery playing Lincoln. And his brother wants to develop some skill in three-card monte. The questions they're asking are: "What am I doing here? How do I fit? And how do I make life work for me?"
I think these are the questions in every play. "Who am I?" and "What am I doing here?" Basically, "Who are we?"

RENNER: So maybe the bigger question is, "How do I become enfranchised in America as myself, whoever and whatever I am?"

PARKS: America is this sea and we have to somehow swim and negotiate. You can get a job that you love and feel like you're making things happen. Or you can have another kind of experience. The people in my plays always seem to have that other kind of experience.

RENNER: You can lose it, too, whatever you have.

PARKS: My characters are struggling to lose it. They're trying to let it go. And it won't let them go, it has its hand around their neck. That's what I mean about America. It can cradle you, and it can grab you by the throat.

CORTHRON: Gloom and doom.

PARKS: Gloom, despair and tragedy. Nothing but the truth.

RENNER: Is it harder now to create a character across racial lines? Is there a self-consciousness about if you're a black playwright writing white characters, or a white playwright writing black characters, or a man writing a young woman?

LONERGAN: I worry about that sometimes. Mostly you try to put yourself in the position the character's in and use your imagination. The audience puts themselves in the place of the characters. That's what theater is in a way, and what novels are. You're getting inside somebody else's head who has gotten inside these imaginary people's heads. And that's the fun of it. But some things you just don't know anything about.

PARKS: Because "Topdog/Underdog" has two guys in it and only two guys, people keep asking, "Well, where are you in the play?" That's the joy of it for me.

RENNER: Do you think audiences are hungry for plays that grapple with social issues that they've read about in the newspapers or heard on the news?

LONERGAN: I don't know. I sometimes feel like audiences just want to see a good show, and I don't mean it in a crass way.

PARKS: I hope they're hungry for more than what they read in the newspaper -- deeper things than a newspaper has the space or the time or the finances to talk about.

CORTHRON: There's a potential audience that doesn't go to the theater because they think it doesn't speak to what they want to hear. There should be discount ticket prices. At the Royal Court in London there were $:5 Mondays. And Mondays it would be packed.

LONERGAN.: Every theater should do that. But they can't with commercial productions because the margin of profit is so narrow.

PARKS: If you're spending $45 or $50 for a ticket, seeing a show is a big deal.

LONERGAN: Even if you go to a movie for $10 and it's lousy you feel burned.

GILMAN: And if you pay $ 70: "That's it, forget it. I'm not going to go see any more plays."

PARKS: For the rest of your life.

GILMAN: What you end up with is a more and more elite audience. And right now, of course, an older and older audience. You don't get the kind of diversity or the young crowd that you want, and theater starts to feel like some sort of rarefied art form.

RENNER: Ken, you mentioned movies. Are they friend or foe to a playwright?

LONERGAN: Financially, if you're working for Hollywood, one job can support you for two years. So you can do a lot of theater writing in that time if you want to. And if you want to try to work in the independent world and have some artistic control, it's a wonderful outlet. The obvious difference is that once you get out of the theater, the writer is no longer the last word on what happens; the director or the producer is.
A lot of people go to Hollywood for the money -- to write for television shows and movies -- and their work is mostly thrown away or rewritten. So that's time spent that they can't spend doing things they might care about more. And that's a shame.

CORTHRON: But you directed "You Can Count on Me," so you did have----

LONERGAN: Yes, the same basic control over the situation. I met a couple of people at Sundance last year who seemed like directors with whom you might be able to work as you do in the theater. Miguel Arteta, who directed "Chuck and Buck"; he's doing another movie now that Mike White wrote. I had a long talk with him. I don't know if you saw that movie, but it's very clearly directed the way you'd direct a play.
You could develop relationships with movie directors that were more like those you have in the theater with directors, where it's not just raw material they take to do with as they will, but a script that has its own integrity, that they're supposed to be serving in some way, supposedly. It doesn't always work that way in the theater either. But that's the stated goal.

RENNER: What about working commercially in the movies, like writing "Analyze This," which I understand you have never wanted to see?

LONERGAN: No, I never saw that movie. It's just a really good day job, you know? It's like just better than speech writing -- for me anyway. And it's fun to work on movie scripts. But I always try to keep them pretty separate because everybody knows what happens. There were 14 writers on "Analyze This." I'm sure it turned out very well, but it's not a situation you would tolerate as a playwright. So you have to be willing to make that trade-off. The more they pay you, the less control you're going to have over the material.

RENNER: So you divorce yourself from the final product?

LONERGAN: Yeah. Which is somewhat painful but not as painful as if you went into it not knowing that could happen or expecting something different. I'd be unlikely to sell a play to the movies because they'd just rip it to pieces. I mean, that's sort of their job.

RENNER: As a playwright yourself what would you say to younger playwrights who might say to you: "I've been writing a couple of little plays here in my notebook. What do you think?"

LONERGAN: Don't listen to anybody.

CORTHRON: Actually, I was going to say that seriously.

LONERGAN: I don't really say, "Don't listen to anybody." I say, "Find two or three people and listen to them if you think they know what they're talking about."

PARKS: Listen to no one and learn how to listen to yourself, which isn't just the process of not listening to anyone. It's tuning your ears.

GILMAN: I think that's really important for a playwright, because sometimes you lose the sense of who you were when you were, say, 8, and you wanted to tell stories. That's the person you've got to get back to.

HEADLINE: Midway Airport Is Undergoing a Major Expansion 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT SHAROFF 

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
MIDWAY AIRPORT, the very distant -- No. 2 airport in the Chicago area behind O'Hare International, is getting a $761 million makeover that includes a new terminal and a number of other improvements aimed at both increasing capacity and smoothing out the congestion that has been a growing problem in recent years.
 The city is also hoping that a revived Midway will act as a catalyst for new development on Chicago's southwest side, a depressed residential and industrial area that has largely missed out on the economic boom of the last decade, which has transformed a number of other inner-city neighborhoods. 
 "It's going to be a radical change both in terms of the look and feel of the facility," said Thomas Walker, the city's commissioner of aviation. "We're more than tripling in size and adding a lot of new services and amenities that will have a significant effect on the surrounding community."
John Tague, chief executive of Indianapolis-based Amtran Inc., the parent company of American Trans Air (ATA), which will be one of the largest tenants at the expanded facility, expects the airport improvements to be pronounced. "We're going," he said, "from what was probably the worst facility in the country to what will be one of the best." 
Midway, which occupies a square mile of land, has a history that stretches back to the dawn of commercial aviation. Dedicated in 1927 as Chicago Municipal Airport, it was, in its early years, the world's busiest airport. 
Renamed Midway in 1949 after the World War II naval battle in which planes played a decisive role, it was the leading airport between the coasts until the early 1960's, when the explosive growth of air travel led to the development of the much-larger O'Hare International Airport 20 miles to the north. 
Midway declined for most of the next two decades and by the early 1980's was almost abandoned. Then, in the early 1990's, it started to come back to life as a hub for value-priced airlines like Southwest Airlines and ATA.
"We provide a lot of service from Midway," said Peter Houghton, director of properties at Dallas-based Southwest Airlines. "The expansion will allow us to grow in a more orderly manner. Right now, we have 121 daily flights to 25 cities. The potential after the expansion is for 190 flights."
Midway's current terminal dates from 1947 and was designed to accommodate about 3 million passengers a year. Last year about 15 million passengers passed through the facility. (By contrast, O'Hare, which by some calculations is the busiest airport in the nation, handled 72 million passengers last year.)
The design of the new Midway facility -- which will open in phases starting next month and finishing in 2004 -- is unusual. It straddles Cicero Avenue, a broad commercial street, with a new check-in and ticketing area on the east side of the street and a food court and two new gate concourses on the west side. The two buildings -- which total just under a million square feet -- are connected by a covered pedestrian bridge. In terms of capacity, Midway will expand to 41 gates from 28. 
THE architect of the four-story, 939,000-square-foot facility is Steven Reiss, a principal with HNTB Architects and Engineers in Alexandria, Va. "Because of its location -- you can see downtown even on a foggy day -- we thought it was important for Midway to be an architectural extension of the city," Mr. Reiss said. "The main materials are brick, painted steel and glass, and the colors are a little warmer than is typical for an airport terminal." 
The old Midway was notably lacking in amenities. The new terminal will have 48,000 square feet of retail space, including a 23,000-square-foot food court with skylights. The city has decided to feature primarily local concessionaires. Of 10 restaurants in the food court, nine are branches of local establishments, including Harry Caray's, Gold Coast Dogs and Potbelly Sandwich Works. (The one exception is a Ben & Jerry's ice cream store.)
"We want Midway to show off the best of Chicago," said Eric Griggs, the department of aviation's deputy commissioner for concessions. He added that concessionaires are being offered 10-year leases at a rent of about 13.2 percent of gross sales. "Right now, Midway's concession sales are about $17 million," he said. "We expect that to jump to $38.9 million in the future."
Midway has always been an economic catalyst for the southwest side. According to Mr. Walker, the facility currently contributes about $2.5 billion to the local economy and is responsible for 50,000 jobs, both on and off site. After the expansion, however, that is expected to grow to $3.4 billion and 94,000 jobs.
"The area is very underutilized," said Christopher Hill, former commissioner of planning and development for the city and currently senior vice president of the suburban Northbrook office of the Grubb & Ellis Company, the real estate services concern. "Right now, there are a lot of warehouses and one-story buildings that are not the kind of thing you normally see around a major metropolitan airport. The opportunity at Midway is for ancillary services such as hotels, restaurants and meeting spaces."
To encourage new development in the surrounding area, the city recently established six tax increment financing districts along Cicero Avenue and other streets, and it is actively courting new businesses with promises of city assistance. Tax increment financing districts, within which owners of new developments receive rebates of part of their property taxes over a period of years, are used by many cities to encourage new development in blighted neighborhoods.
The first beneficiary of the program is ATA, which announced earlier this month that it would build a new 220,000-square-foot training center for pilots and other personnel and participate in constructing a 100-room hotel on about 10 acres of land just north of Midway on Archer Avenue.
"We'll be opening for the first time a facility that will consolidate all of our training in one place," Mr. Tague said.
The project will cost about $98 million -- of which $24.5 million is coming from the city -- and will involve both new construction and renovation of an existing industrial building.
According to Kenneth Wolff, ATA's chief financial officer, ATA would prefer to lease the facility, but Illinois tax laws may require the airline to own the property to qualify for the tax increment financing money. Either way, construction is expected to start later this year and be finished in 2003.
AS for Cicero Avenue, the area's main commercial street, the city recently completed an extensive streetscape renovation on the blocks that stretch from the Stevenson Expressway to Midway. The project installed islands and planters down the middle of the thoroughfare in an effort to make it more attractive to retailers. 
"We see it as an area with a lot of opportunity," said Alicia Mazur Berg, the city's commissioner of planning and development. "You don't just make a $761 million public investment and not have a substantial spinoff in the community."
In a move that many see as a barometer that the neighborhood is taking a turn for the better, the first new business to move onto the formerly blighted strip is a 1,700-square-foot drive-through Starbucks Coffee at the southeast corner of Cicero and 47th Street. The restaurant is one of two Starbucks in the Chicago area that are co-owned by the Johnson Development Corporation, a division of Magic Johnson Enterprises in Beverly Hills, Calif.
"We studied the traffic counts and realized it could be a very successful location," said Kenneth Lombard, president of Johnson Development. "The traffic counts we did prior to opening the store were very good even without the boost we'll get from the expansion of Midway. We always look for underserved inner-city markets, and Cicero Avenue is a good example of that."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New Jersey; 
In Jersey City, an Industrial Park by the Hudson

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
IT may seem that every inch of the Hudson River waterfront in this old industrial city is filling with new office towers or apartment buildings. But a 50-acre patch overlooking the river on the far southern reaches of the shoreline is being returned, after a sluggish start, to the city's roots as an industrial park with up to a million square feet of commercial space.
 The park, Greenville Yards, was conceived in the late 1980's and is being built by Barrett Urban Renewal of Fort Lee, which was designated the redeveloper by the Jersey City Redevelopment Authority. It took nearly 10 years to gain clear title to the property, work through the environmental issues and bring utilities and roads to the park, which is not far from Exit 14A of the New Jersey Turnpike. It is also just south of the Port Liberte housing project and four miles south of the Newport mixed-use complex. 
 The first building, with 120,000 square feet on 10.2 acres, was completed in September for Summit Import Corporation, a distributor and importer of Asian foods. The company is using the building at 100 Summit Place for its corporate headquarters and a refrigerated warehouse distribution center. 
Construction is to start next month on a second building, with 137,000 square feet, on 8.5 acres that will be built for Preferred Freezer Services, a cold storage food distribution company in Perth Amboy that is expanding. Its president, John J. Galiher, said he is also negotiating for another building, of up to 60,000 square feet on three acres, for MCST Preferred Transportation and MCST Preferred Logistics, wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
In addition, Thomas Barrett, president of Barrett Urban Renewal, said that contracts are being or will soon be negotiated for three more buildings, with a total of 500,000 square feet, that will also be built for specific users. And he said that discussions are under way with tenants for the rest of the space, adding that the park would be completed in 16 months at a cost of more than $50 million.
Because of the recent boom economy and the "resurgence of development in the metropolitan area," Mr. Barrett said, there is need for distribution facilities close to markets like New York and northern New Jersey.
The activity reflects the strength of Jersey City's industrial market. At the end of 2000 its vacancy rate was 6.02 percent, down from 6.32 percent in 1999, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the commercial brokerage and real estate services company. During that same time the average annual per square foot rental rate rose to $6.15 from $5.85.
Many of the older existing buildings in the city have low ceilings and are considered unsuitable for some users, and there has been limited construction of new buildings, like those at Greenville Yards, with high ceilings, sprinkler fire-fighting systems and super-flat floors, which make it possible to stack products higher.
Jason Goldman, an associate director at the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield, said that while "the demand is there" for such buildings the supply is constrained by the lack of readily available land on which to build. 
ONE of the few other new construction projects is a 75,000 square foot addition being built for USCO Logistics at its existing 275,000 square foot building on Caven Point Road. And on 10 adjoining acres work is under way on a 172,000 square foot building. 
The developer of both projects is Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus, among the state's larger industrial landlords with 15 million square feet, 800,000 of it in Jersey City. 
Emanuel Stern, president of Hartz, said that with almost no vacancy in its industrial portfolio his company is "confident users will continue to chase a declining inventory." Hartz started the 172,000 square foot Jersey City building on speculation, he said, adding that discussions are under way with a food distribution company to lease the entire building.
The appeal of Jersey City's industrial market, like its office market, is its location. Industrial users that want quick access to Manhattan as well as nearby Newark International Airport and area seaports will choose Jersey City, said Bill Waxman, first vice president at the Paramus office of CB Richard Ellis, another commercial brokerage company. 
The area seaports have grown more attractive to some users, especially importers, since last June, when the governors of New York and New Jersey approved a 30-year lease that the Port Authority had signed with the Maersk-Sealand shipping line at the Elizabeth Marine Terminal.
Otherwise, Mr. Waxman said, potential tenants would travel to Exit 8 of the New Jersey Turnpike in the central part of the state, where new space is more readily available and less expensive. Rents in Jersey City are, however, lower than those in Manhattan, he added. 
Greenville Yards is meant to capitalize not only on that geography but its location within a federally designated foreign trade zone as well as in a state-designated urban enterprise zone. 
FOREIGN trade zones provide companies such benefits as decreased or delayed customs taxes; enterprise zones offer, among other things, a tax exemption on services and goods, including construction material, that companies buy to use in the zone. Mr. Barrett said there is at least a 7 percent cost saving to companies moving to Greenville Yards. 
Mr. Galiher, the president of Preferred Freezer Services. said that the tax incentives make the deal more cost-effective.
Sanford Greenberg, project coordinator at the Jersey City Redevelopment Authority, said that Greenville Yards is in the area south of Port Liberte that "Jersey City continues to see for industrial growth." In turn, he said, it will help meet the city's goal for balanced development, jobs and revenue.
Getting to this point has not been easy. The 50-acre site was part of a roughly 200-acre area once owned by Conrail and used as a train switching station until the early 1980's. Through the next decade the Port Authority developed about 110 of those acres for such uses as Tropicana's Northeast distribution center, and BMW's car-preparation facility. 
In that same period the authority contracted to sell the Greenville Yards site to the city with a deed restricting it to industrial use. Then the recession of the early 90's hit, dampening the industrial market in northern and central New Jersey and leaving it with a surfeit of space. 
Mr. Greenberg said there were other challenges, such as conducting an environmental investigation of the site, which "took a lot longer than anticipated." Ultimately, Mr. Barrett said, the site will be remediated as it is developed, with each building, landscaping or parking lot serving as a cap to seal in contaminants, including hydrocarbons, from the train operations. Ground water at the site must also be monitored.
It also took time to gain clear title to the property, part of which was still owned by Conrail and occupied by an active rail line. (That became more complicated when CSX Corporation along with Norfolk Southern Corporation began negotiating to acquire Conrail and take over its tracks and equipment, a deal that became final in 1999.) 
Finally, railroad tracks running through the center of the redevelopment site had to be relocated to its southern border, and another line on the northern side of the property was moved off site. That work was not completed until early 1999, Mr. Barrett said.
The annual asking rental rates for space at Greenville Yards are $7 to $8.50 a square foot -- but users so far are buying their buildings, Mr. Barrett said, noting that, in general, sale prices are $60 to $70 a square foot but could be higher depending on the use.
The first user at the park, Summit Import, distributes its food products mainly to Manhattan and the tri-state area. It relocated from Greenwich Street in TriBeCa in Manhattan and ultimately will employ about 100 people. 
Whiting Wu, Summit's president, said he had looked at other locations in New York, including Brooklyn, Long Island City and Staten Island, before settling on having a new building put up for his company at Greenville Yards. "We need to be near our customer base, so logistically it makes sense," he said, adding that retrofitting an existing building "would not have fit the bill." 
Mr. Greenberg of the Jersey City Redevelopment Authority said his agency is "planning other industrial developments on smaller areas in the city." He said those plans "could take off in the next few months."

HEADLINE: ART; 
Gallery Hopping Under a Single Roof

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

 BODY:
THE membership of the Silvermine Guild in New Canaan keeps growing, and one of the benefits of membership is an exhibition. The problem then is how to present a coherent display of disparate work by a lot of artists.
 The solution at the moment is to have five separate shows, each with a cogent theme decided on by the guild's exhibition committee. 
 The shows seem like disciplined vignettes. Two of them are on the small side. Lou Hicks, Juliet Holland, and Sharon Wandel are in "Winter White" a show that seems a harbinger of spring. 
Ms. Hicks and Ms. Holland are painters who complement each other. Ms. Hicks aims for subtlety and recession. Her color range here is grey and white, and the use of close values creates a Tonalist atmosphere that is deliberately ephemeral, just as a winter storm is. One painting is an exception: "Trees in Winter" employs outline, to make the trees distinct, and momentarily Ms. Hicks's contribution to the show loses the quality of reverie. 
On the other hand Ms. Holland adds extraneous materials to her paintings on wood to make them into reliefs. Her work is sere and viewers might be reminded of snow with a crust. But she also divides her paintings into sections reminiscent of Rothko's clouds, a factor that tames the innate aggressive quality of adding on material.
Ms. Wandel sculpts small stylized birds out of bronze. They are as small as robins but have the demeanor of falcons and, mounted on steel poles, act like sentries. If Ms. Hicks and Ms. Holland provide fleeting weather, Ms. Wandel contributes sharp actuality.
"Back Home Away from Home," the second small show, is characterized by a deliberate uniformity -- at least in size. All the photographs of both Nash Hyon, who works in Italy and Tertuliano Delgado, whose subject is his homeland, the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of West Africa, are postcard size.
In a bit of interaction with the audience, viewers are asked to draw their own postcards (materials are supplied) and to put pushpins on maps to identify their own home away from home. The relentless lineup of similarly sized images effectively reminds us of the old lesson: our one planet is one of splendid variety.
The first show encountered in the larger galleries, "Neo Madonna" contains some interesting images even though it is puzzling over all. "Where's the Madonna?" the literally minded might justifiably ask, or better in the current era, "What is a Madonna?" The inspiration of the Renaissance is hard to find and the contemporary singer isn't really here either.
Leslie Giuliani offers large charcoal drawings that are stately over all and small garish ones using encaustic that are more frenetic. Everything in this show addresses, sometimes obliquely, the issue of femaleness, but occasionally in the charcoal drawings the artist evokes the strangeness of Frida Kahlo.
Partick Maisano echoes Ms. Guiliani in his black and white diptychs. They contain figures with text written all over them. Mr. Maisano's inclusion here is daunting: a viewer can't quite make out the figures, and is hardly tempted to plow through the writing. Eve Stockton's marble and alabaster sculptures seem to be incipient figures, and her drawing, "Fertility Figure" underscores the theme of tentativeness by evoking conception. In the drawing a droplet seems to be touching a leaf.
Joan Wheeler, who used to stage narrative tableaux with toy dolls has moved on to larger, almost life-sized, but faceless figures freed from the box. But she has retained the creepiness inherent in her former work. Three of the figures seem to be penitents; they are dressed in coarse cloth and wear religious symbols. The fourth, a merry contrast, is made of flowers.
The fourth show, "Art Noir," is about darkness and intense light. David Boyajian tells the story of Persephone in the underworld and her rebirth in four stainless steel sculptures. Ann Chernow continues her interest in old movies, and in scumbled grisaille she recreates posters for lurid films of the 1830's and 1840's. Mitchell Friedman, who has mastered a black-and-white idiom, is a good complement to Ms. Chernow. If the atmosphere she resurrects is one of ominousness in basically urban or civilized settings, Mr. Friedman conjures up rural unease. His largest work is "Swamp."
"Industrial Archeology," the last show, is also the meatiest. In the middle of the last century the style called Precisionism chronicled and celebrated American industry and factories. Smoke from factory chimneys often served as a soft-edged counterpoint to the angular shapes of the buildings, silos and other structures. The inherent excitement of this is revived in watercolors by Alex McFarlane. While his watercolors are ideal -- they're named after elements such as copper and iron -- Christy Gallagher thoroughly examines the once-and-always industrial city of Bridgeport in 20 oil paintings and watercolors.
Jim Felice's tall cylindrical black steel "Smoke Stacks" are imposing; a lineup of them cuts across the gallery.
At the other end of the scale, Robert Dancik displays jewelry made of industrial materials on mannequins' wrists. Mr. McFarlane contributes sculptures representing streamlined industrial buildings, made from an unusual material: solid graphite.
 "5 Gallery Shows" runs through March 18 at the Silvermine Guild Art Center, 1037 Silvermine Road, New Canaan. Information: (203) 966-5617.

HEADLINE: The View From/Darien; 
Wanted: A Rink of Their Own Just a Stone's Throw Away

BYLINE:  By DARICE BAILER 

 BODY:
IN the Ardsley Curling Club's bright white rink, Anne Wiggins knelt behind a bull's-eye painted red, white and blue at one end of the ice while her teammate Jim Meinhold awaited instructions at the opposite end before attempting his next shot.
 In front of Ms. Wiggins, an opponent's granite stone rested on the bull's-eye in scoring position. 
 "Take it out," Ms. Wiggins said to Mr. Meinhold. 
Mr. Meinhold slid forward and released his 42-pound stone, which glided down the ice like a bowling ball. Two of his teammates on the Nutmeg Curling Club, Marianne Moore and Carleton Cleveland, furiously swept the ice in front of the stone to help smooth its path.
With its silver handle, Mr. Meinhold's stone looked like a whirling tea kettle. Takeout accomplished: he had whacked his opponent's stone off the scoring circle. But alas, Mr. Meinhold's stone sailed off, too.
It was a scoring dud.
"It's O.K.," Ms. Wiggins, who is from Redding and is the team's captain, said during the Sunday afternoon game. "If something doesn't go as you planned, you always look for Plan B."
And that is just what the Nutmeg Curling Club was forced to do after losing its home site at the Country Club of Darien, where the team had leased space from 1963 to 1998.
Mr. Meinhold, who is 53 and lives in Wilton, is part of an $800,000 fund-raising campaign by the curlers to build a facility in Fairfield County where over 95 percent of the club's 89 members reside. He is also the vice president of the Nutmeg Curling Club, which for the last three years has rented the rink at the Ardsley Country Club in Westchester County.
The Nutmeggers lost their home rink after the Darien club became concerned about the declining membership of the curlers and the lack of income generated from the group. For a prorated fee, curling members were granted winter membership at Darien during the curling season (October through March), including dining privileges.
Jill Owens, 47, of Bridgeport, who started curling at Nutmeg in 1968, estimated that in the early 1980's, the Nutmeg Curling club had around 220 curlers. But, as some members moved on, the club had trouble recruiting. The membership shrunk in half, and the country club began to take in less money from the dining room and the bar.
Ian Fetigan, the general manager at the Country Club of Darien from 1989 to 2000, said board members were reluctant to kick out the curlers because the sport is so uncommon, but they began to realize that "we had potentially better use of that space."
In 1997, when the lease was up, Mr. Fetigan said the curling club was given an ultimatum to bring in new members. But the membership increased by less than a handful, and in 1998 the Darien club began converting the area where the curling club played into locker rooms.
"Economically it made sense to them, but it left us out in the cold," said the 50-year-old Ms. Wiggins, who has a one-hour commute to Ardsley.
The Nutmeggers are not the only curlers asked to leave a country club site. It seems that participation in curling is leveling off across the country and the world.
In Chicago, for example, three to four clubs have suffered the same fate as the Nutmeggers, according to Rick Patzke, the communications director of the United States Curling Association, the sport's governing board.
Mr. Patzke said that curling participation swelled after World War II and in the 1970's "at a time there weren't so many sports competing with people's leisure time."
In the United States, there are 130 curling clubs (Connecticut also has the Norfolk Curling Club). The number of members in the United States, about 15,000, has remained stable for the last 10 years, Mr. Patzke said. 
There are 36 nations in the World Curling Federation with the United States membership ranking third behind Canada and Britain, Mr. Patzke said.
Canada has 800,000 curlers, said Warren Hansen, the Canadian Curling Association's manager of event operations and media. And, while Canadian interest in curling has increased based on television viewing audiences and attendance at the men's curling championship, membership is a different story. "I don't think it's changed so much since 1990," said Mr. Hansen said, who added that Canadian curling teams also had to work hard to keep their clubs going.
Even without a place to call home the last three years, the Nutmeggers keep rolling. And the club has not lost many members, despite the lengthy commutes to Ardsley.
"That's pretty impressive from my perspective," Brian Lawless, 44, a curler from New Fairfield, said. "It's a bigger time commitment to stay active."
The Nutmeggers have raised $450,000 through member donations. They have formed building and site committees to find a new home, which will require one and a half acres of land. The game is played on sheets of ice 15 feet 7 inches wide and 146 feet long. Mr. Cleveland, a past president of the club and a Darien resident, estimated that it would take one million dollars to build a new facility.
James O'Boyle, a club member from Norwalk, said that the major problem has been finding a piece of land in Fairfield County that is affordable. Deals to buy land in Wilton or lease space in Norwalk have fallen through. Club members are trying to lease land in South Wilton to build a rink.
Mr. O'Boyle said he would have a hard time even estimating the number of hours he had spent hunting for building sites.
"A lot of people put in a lot of hours," said Mr. O'Boyle, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. 
Curlers call the sport chess on ice because it involves strategy, and they liken it to golf because it is a sport where courtesy and good sportsmanship prevail. After a two-hour game, the winners buy the losers drinks, and then the losers reciprocate. Players linger in the lounge before a crackling fire discussing key shots like bridge players reviewing their hands.
"You never talk about bad shots; you only talk about good ones," Mr. O'Boyle said.
The players look forward to tournaments against other clubs, and their love for the sport bonds them with curlers around the world. "You can walk in any club in the world and instantly there are 50 people who are all your friends," Mr. Lawless said.
He hopes the club will soon find a home.
"You can only go so long with an organization before it finds a home or it falls apart," Mr. Lawless said. "Every organization, every church or synagogue, we all need homes."

HEADLINE: Rental Season For Summer Stays Hot 

BYLINE:  By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
APPROACH David Jones, a broker with Prudential Connecticut Realty in Old Lyme, Conn. and tell him you have $15,000 to spend on the rental of a summer house on the coastline of Long Island Sound, and he will respond ever so politely, "That's nice, but I have nothing left."
 Make the same request across the sound on the North Fork of Long Island, and Suzanne Hahn, who owns two real estate agencies, will probably say: "Yes, I have a variety of rentals from seasonal cottages to waterfront estates. The summer rental market is just about starting now." 
 On the Jersey shore, Diane Turton, president of the real estate brokerage that bears her name, keeps a waiting list of hopeful renters for whom she has nothing at the moment. "We tell people houses are scarce and if something becomes available, we will show it to them," she said. Asked what advice she would give prospective renters facing empty inventories, she said, "I tell them to buy something -- and then rent it out." 
No matter how far along they are in depleting their summer inventories, brokers up and down the East Coast say business is thriving. Even as sales and rental prices for apartments in New York City have eased their angle of ascent somewhat, the quest for summer weekend and vacation rental houses shows no signs of abating, with prices up slightly from last year or at least constant.
Some landlords are content to get what they got last year, but others are asking for -- and getting -- increases that can fall anywhere between 3 and 30 percent, brokers say. In Saltaire on the western end of Fire Island, for example, Ali Beqaj, owner of Beqaj Real Estate, said, "Houses that went for $8,000 to $9,000 a month last year are $10,000 to $11,000, and houses on the ocean that were $30,000 for the season last year are getting $35,000 this year without even a question."
Nowhere are rents as stratospheric as they are in the Hamptons, with rentals for castles on the beach commanding $500,000 or more. A price tag of $30,000 a season -- Memorial Day through Labor Day -- is considered modest there. 
But, Jay Flagg, manager of the Southampton office of Prudential Long Island Realty, has detected a hint of restraint lately. "We're not seeing the increases in asking rents that we saw a year ago," he said the other day. "This year, landlords are not as ambitious for two reasons. The market was so hot last year that there were many sales, and some of them had increased their prices by such substantial amounts that they did not rent at all. This year they are more willing to negotiate." 
Mr. Flagg has one client now completing his second rental spec property in the Hamptons, a four-bedroom center hall colonial with pool and sunken tennis court in Sagaponack, which he has listed at $135,000 for the season. 
"He has bought two other lots with the same intention," Mr. Flagg said. "He will have spent $1.6 million per house by the time he's finished and will get $125,000 to $150,00 each per season, so as an investment he is making 10 percent. He exemplifies confidence in the rental market." 
How long rentals will continue to be impervious to the gyrations of the stock market, the demise of many dot-coms and the spreading wave of layoffs remains to be seen. But, for now at least, three months before Memorial Day, brokers up and down the East Coast from Kennebunkport, Me., to Kiawah Island, S.C., say they have sensed no surge in the number of owners seeking to recover from economic setbacks by renting out their houses nor any resistance among tenants to asking prices. In fact, demand has risen since last summer in many communities, and houses are being snapped up faster. 
"What is happening defies logic," said Jeff Akers, the general manager of Kiawah Island Villa Resorts, which handles rentals of 550 homes and condominiums on the barrier beach island off the coast of South Carolina near Charleston. "Last year was flat or maybe just a little bit up, but this year the forecast is terrific. Right now rentals are running 20 to 25 percent ahead of last year, and when you read the papers, you wonder why."
On Nantucket, Craig Hawkins, a broker with Maury People, a Resort Quest company and a Sotheby's affiliate, which has more than 1,000 rental houses on its roster, said the gross value of rentals had already outstripped those of last year by $100,000. 
"Last year at this time we were at $1,831,245," he said. "This year we are at $1,935,120." 
"I see no indication whatsoever of a slowdown and if we have a recession, rentals will continue to chug along full speed," he said. "They carried this and other companies through the last recession. People still go on vacation." 
IN fact, brokers agree that the uncertain economy is helping to fuel the rental market as prospective buyers wait to see what will happen to their portfolios or decide that renting offers a good holding pattern until sales prices decline. 
"If the sales market takes a downturn, that means more people will be renting," said Andrew Hart, managing broker in the East Hampton office of Cook Pony Farm, which has 11 offices spread over the Hamptons. "Judging by the leases I've seen coming through, we're probably doing the same volume of work as last year at this time and have done more high-end rentals early." 
Mr. Beqaj said he had few properties on Fire Island to show clients. 
"A lot of houses were sold over the last two years," said Mr. Beqaj, whose primary market is Saltaire, but who also does business in the less expensive communities of Kismet and Fair Harbor. "Now they are owner occupied and no longer rented."
Or if they continue to be available, "most are taken by the same people who keep coming back," he said. "And if they want a different house, they look in August or in the fall. Right now I have about a dozen houses available."
The same situation prevails in Ocean Beach, the island's most densely populated village and the hub of its night life. "A tremendous number of houses were sold in the last three years, and most of those had a history of renting for the full season," said Dana Wallace, owner of an agency there that bears his name. "Most new owners want to use them, so you're looking at a shrunken market. At the end of January, we had the full season's rental list done." 
However, people who envision themselves relaxing on a sandy beach or hiking up a mountain need not despair. But they may have to compromise about their expectations or be flexible about the time periods. 
"There is always some inventory," said Diane Saatchi, president of Dayton-Halstead in the Hamptons, which has offices in Bridgehampton, East Hampton and Sag Harbor. "There is always some property that comes on the market. We have rented houses in June that people have been very happy with."
But, she continued: "If someone came to me now and said they wanted to spend $50,000 for a four-bedroom house with air-conditioning, a heated pool and tennis court, I would say the few houses like that are already gone. For $50,000 we could probably get them a tennis court and three bedrooms or no tennis court and four bedrooms. Of course, there would be a pool at both."
On Long Beach Island off the New Jersey shore, John Franzoni, owner of Oceanside Realty, which has offices in Harvey Cedars and Surf City, offered much the same assessment. 
"It's not true that everything is gone," he said. "I might not be able to get you the oceanfront you want for the price you want in the first week in August, but the good houses are not all gone and we continue to get new authorizations as the season goes on."
In a typical year, Mr. Franzoni said: "We do about 2,500 leases, with the average lease for two weeks. We have an enormous range in rentals, from a two-bedroom duplex in a two-family home on the bay side of Surf City for $1,000 a week to a six-bedroom house with a pool on the beach in Loveladies for $30,000 a week."
On Long Island's North Fork, Ms. Hahn had a varied selection of houses to show a visitor recently as she drove around the nautical environs of Orient and Greenport and the farmlands and vineyards of Cutchogue.
"The summer rental market is different every year, and you can't make predictions until March," said Ms. Hahn, who owns Hahn Realty in Greenport and Marion R. King Realty in Cutchogue. "With President's Day weekend over, we are now starting the prime rental season," she said. "Over the weekend a lot of places were rented, but we still have a good amount available." Prices in her area range from $75,000 for a beachfront estate with four bedrooms, down through $25,000 to $35,000 for a waterfront home with three bedrooms and no pool or one off the water with a pool, and on down to two-bedroom cottage for $10,000 to $15,000 a season. 
As elsewhere, "the price of summer rentals varies with the proximity to water," she said. "The most desirable is sandy beach front and expansive Long Island Sound front. Houses located on creeks, of which we have a large variety, may offer docks or vistas over tranquil inlets and bay access."
Her agencies do not handle leases for less than a month's occupancy. Although she does have some monthly rentals listed now, Ms. Hahn said, "Sometimes if a house hasn't rented for the season, they split it up. But that doesn't usually happen until April." Monthly rentals on the North Fork tend to range from $5,000 to $25,000. 
In some communities, the successful search for a house is as much the product of good timing as anything else. In Bethany Beach, Del., Sue Cooper, rental manager of Crowley Associates, which handles 275 properties that rent mainly for week and two-week periods, said: 
"I am turning people away, one call after another. By Jan. 15 we had everything on the three blocks from the ocean from June 9 to the first week of September booked. Since then we have picked up about six new listings and have rented the majority of those. Now I have a few things that are within six blocks of the beach but not much else. And the few seasonal rentals we get, maybe 15 a summer, were gone by the first week in January. Normally that is not true until February." 
By contrast, it is still early in the hunting season in areas like Dutchess and Columbia Counties in New York.
Kevin Battistoni, principal broker with Leigh Ponvert Real Estate, a Christie's affiliate, which has offices in Millbrook and Rhinebeck, N.Y., did not get many inquiries until about two weeks ago. 
"The weather was an inhibition to people who want to come north and not a lot of people look in the dead of winter," he said. 
Of course, a good number of renters forgo looking altogether, in particular those who rerent houses they have already occupied or who rely on the Internet for photographs and description. 
REPEAT business is thriving in Montauk at the eastern tip of Long Island, where John Keeshan who has been in business for 30 years said: "Almost every rental that has been taken by one family for the last two years has been rerented by the same family. All we have to do is call the tenant from last year, who says, 'Yes, send me the lease and I'll send you the check.' "
But, he went on, "Fifty percent of the rentals for the season are still available at prices ranging from $18,500 to $25,000. There are also a few houses with pools on the ocean available by the month, starting at $100,000."
Procrastinators might find something as late as May 1, especially those seeking leases of two weeks. "No matter how good the market, not every one will rent and those people may be more amenable to short rentals then," Mr. Keeshan said. 
People who prefer inland countryside settings to the beach may find more meager choices.
"We do rentals on a limited basis because there are not a lot of them available," Mr. Battistoni said about northern Dutchess and southern Columbia Counties. "People who own properties here own them to use them during the summer. At the moment, there is so little rental inventory that it is scary."
When houses are available, he said, they tend to run from a low of $15,000 for the season to as much as $50,000, but the larger properties with acres of rolling grounds are rarely put up for rent. 
Farther south on the Hudson River, Nora Preusser, president of A. D. Preusser Real Estate in Garrison, Putnam County, said: "We have very few summer rentals, and many of what we have are repeat customers. If people don't buy, they just continue to rent. There are less than a dozen houses available, and people are looking at them right now."
Nor is there much to buy. "You have to wait for someone to die, divorce or change houses," she said. Rentals in Garrison range from $4,000 a month for what Ms. Preusser described as "an average American home" -- three bedrooms on two acres with no pool -- to $75,000 to $90,000 a season for four bedrooms with pool, tennis court and river view. 
Farther north, as ski areas are increasingly transformed into year-round destinations, more houses and condos for up for rent. 
"No more than 15 percent of the homes are used regularly by the owners," said Jim Collier, owner of Loon Reservation Service in Lincoln, N.H., that covers the Franconia Notch area. "People tend to use them either as ski houses or summer vacation homes, opting to rent them in the opposite season."
There are a number of programs that draw tourists to the White Mountains who subsequently become regular renters, Mr. Collier said.
Among the events he cited: the Inside Out Soul Festival, which is a Christian rock music festival; a Chevrolet Corvette rally; a trained bear show; and the New Hampshire Highland Games, which bring some 60,000 people of Scottish ancestry for cultural and athletic events, including the tossing of the caber, a large log. 
"Every time you get a new feature like that, you bring people to the area who have not been here before, and then they tend to return," he said. 
Noting that the average stay in his corner of New Hampshire is six days, Mr. Collier said the most expensive accommodation would be a four-bedroom house with sleeping space for 10 to 12 people at $1,469 a week. The least expensive would be a town house with a master bedroom and sleeping loft for $729 a week.
"We limit reservations to no more than a year ahead, and people start booking then," he said. "We probably have about 40 percent of the 240 homes we list booked so far, so there is still space left."
IN Manchester, Vt., Chester Kasnowski, owner of CondoHome Rentals, who has listings for 80 southern Vermont houses from restored farmhouses to cabins in the woods, said the pace of inquiries he was getting for summer rentals was stepping up. 
"In February and March we get calls from retirees from Florida, who make a straight track up here for July, August and September and are looking for high-quality condos. They come to Manchester for its designer outlets, music and dance programs and antiquing." 
But with prices half what they are in the winter, owners are more likely to occupy the premises themselves, so inventory can be tight. 
"A three-bedroom house within 10 minutes of Stratton Mountain would go for about $1,000 for two nights from November through April and even more on holidays," Mr. Kasnowski said. "In the summer, the same house goes to $2,000 a month."
"The clientele is completely different," he went on. "Skiers tend to be young, stockbroker guys in their 30's and 40's with more discretionary funds. The summer people are on fixed incomes and are looking for the $2,000 a month or less bargain." 
What they can find this year ranges from a five-bedroom restored farm house for $5,000 a month to mountainside condos for $2,300 a month to rustic chalets for $1,500. 
Whatever the economy brings, Mr. Kasnowski remains unflaggingly optimistic about his business. 
"Unfortunately, I do better when the economy gets worse because the population on the East Coast decides not to travel so far," he said. "They come to Vermont rather than going to Europe or Aspen. Even in a recession, you still have to have fun. You just don't spend as much -- or go as far."

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME; 
Rent Rules: Codification Or Stretch?

BYLINE:  By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
LAST December, the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal adopted numerous amendments to the rules enforcing rent laws in New York City and the rest of the state, and some details in the changes it made are causing heated debate. Lawyers who represent landlords say the amendments accurately reflect changes in the law passed by the State Legislature; tenant advocates contend that in some cases the housing division may have overstepped its authority.
 The changes, which took effect on Dec. 20, were adopted as amendments to the New York City Rent Stabilization Code (which governs rent-stabilized apartments in the city); the Emergency Tenant Protection Regulations (which govern stabilized apartments outside the city); the New York City Rent and Eviction Regulations (which govern rent-controlled apartments in the city); and the State Rent and Eviction Regulations (which govern rent-controlled apartments outside the city). 
 Rent control applies to apartments in buildings put up before Feb. 1, 1947, and occupied since before July 1, 1971, by the same tenants or their successors. Rent stabilization generally applies to apartments in buildings with six or more units built between 1947 and 1974 and to tenants who moved into pre-1947 buildings with six or more units after June 30, 1971. Post-1974 buildings that were built with various forms of government subsidy or tax relief may also be subject to rent stabilization. 
Officials say the amendments were adopted to bring the regulations in line with existing rent laws, judicial decisions and housing division interpretations of those laws. Some of the more contentious changes -- on base rents, vacancy allowances and roommates -- are examined in this column, and other provisions will be discussed next week.
Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, a tenant advocacy organization, said that what he called one of the most "harmful" changes relates to the way the "legal rent" for an apartment is determined when a tenant files a rent-overcharge complaint. In the past, Mr. McKee said, the maximum allowable rent for an apartment would be calculated by taking the last rent registered with the housing division and adding to that any allowable increases that followed the registration.
Under the new regulations, however, Mr. McKee said, the "base date" for determining the rent used to calculate an overcharge claim is defined as the rent four years before the filing of the complaint. Thus, he said, the housing division will look back only four years from the complaint date, whether or not there was a registered rent on file at that time. 
So, even if the last rent registered for an apartment was filed, say, six years ago, the agency will now look back only four years -- to the rent that was actually being charged then -- to establish the last "legal regulated rent" for the apartment, whether or not the rent being charged at that time was, in fact, legal. In other words, Mr. McKee said, under the new regulations, an illegal rent would automatically become legal if no complaint had been filed within four years.
However, he said, since the Rent Stabilization Law provides that no base rent can be established unless the rent has been properly registered with the housing division, the agency appears to have exceeded its powers by creating what amounts to a new "base rent" based upon a four-year statute of limitations. Accordingly, Mr. McKee said, his organization intends to challenge the change in the regulations in court.
Sherwin Belkin, a Manhattan lawyer who represents landlords, countered that the four-year statute of limitations on rent-overcharge complaints had been created by the Legislature in the 1997 law. 
"All the D.H.C.R. has done was codify what the Legislature has already deemed to be an appropriate way to eliminate ancient record keeping," Mr. Belkin said. He added that while tenant advocates might argue otherwise, applying the four-year limitation to the calculation of the last legal rent was within the agency's power.
Debbie Del Pino, a spokeswoman for the housing division in Manhattan, said the amendments were a result of the Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1997, which requires the agency to update the codes to take into account changes in the law, judicial interpretations of existing law and various operational bulletins and policy statements issued by the division.
Ms. Del Pino said the agency believes the regulations contain "some of the strongest tenant protection provisions in the nation" and will withstand challenges in court.
Another amendment that disturbs tenant advocates is one that permits landlords to collect multiple vacancy allowances during a single "guidelines period. 
Mr. McKee explained that under the former regulations, when a rent-stabilized apartment became vacant, a landlord could obtain a 20 percent "vacancy allowance" if the new tenant signed a two-year lease or an 18 percent vacancy allowance if the tenant signed a one-year lease. Such increases, however, were limited to one increase per "guidelines period," the one-year time period between rent increases granted by the Rent Guidelines Board. 
Now, however, there is no limit on the number of vacancy-allowance increases a landlord can obtain during a guidelines period. And that, Mr. McKee said, will make it easier for some landlords to increase rents.
"It's no secret that the buildings with the highest turnovers are those in the worst condition," Mr. McKee said. "So what you're going to end up with now is higher and higher rents in the worst-maintained buildings."
Mr. Belkin argued that the potential increase in the number of vacancy allowances a landlord can obtain had also been addressed by the Legislature.
"The vacancy increase is now statutory," Mr. Belkin said, explaining that before the 1997 change in the law, the Rent Guidelines Board awarded such increases once each year. "The Legislature said that the vacancy increase is permitted every time a tenancy changes, and that is exactly what the D.H.C.R. regulations now provide," Mr. Belkin said. 
Another controversial amendment has to do with the rent a tenant can legally charge a roommate. 
Sandra Russo, housing law coordinator for Legal Services for New York City, a not-for-profit organization that represents poor clients in civil actions, said that in the past, financial arrangements between roommates were the business of only the roommates themselves. Under the new regulations, however, Ms. Russo said, a tenant may charge a roommate only for the roommate's "proportionate share of the rent."
Thus, she said, if a tenant living alone in an apartment takes in one roommate, the roommate cannot pay more than 50 percent of the rent.
"Not only does this interfere with the private relationships between individuals, but it allows the landlord to pry into their personal finances," Ms. Russo said, explaining that once a landlord discovers there is a roommate living in an apartment with a tenant, the landlord will then have the right to find out how much rent the roommate is paying. If a landlord learns a tenant is charging a roommate more than the proportional share of the rent, this could conceivably be grounds for eviction, but Ms. Russo said that the issue is so new, it has not yet been tested. 
"I've seen plenty of cases where an elderly person living on a fixed income takes in a roommate to help with the rent," Ms. Russo said. "And many times the roommate agrees to pay more than half the rent in exchange for the tenant keeping house and taking care of other chores. Why should the landlord be allowed to interfere with that kind of arrangement?"
Mr. Belkin said that concerns about the impact of allowing tenants to charge roommates only for their proportionate share of the rent seemed to ignore the impact that prior practice had on roommates.
"In a tight housing market, it is not unusual for roommates to be charged excessive rents by tenants," he said, adding that the original purpose of the law was to allow for companionship and shared expenses.
"All the D.H.C.R. has done with this amendment is ensure that a tenant's rent-stabilized apartment cannot be turned into a profit-making enterprise," he said. 
Mr. Belkin added that while there may be different views about the legitimacy of many of the amendments, "the courts will be the ultimate arbiter."

Fasten Seat Belts, But Expect a Soft Impact

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JAMES 

 BODY:
The slowdown in the economy isn't an abstraction for Oneil Taylor. A week and a half ago, it became very real. He was laid off, one of 10,000 employees -- 1,500 in New Jersey -- let go by Lucent Technologies. 
 But despite such highly publicized layoffs and a slowdown in the national economy, the New Jersey economy, which is finishing a ninth year of very robust growth, still appears to be healthy. 
 A report by the New Jersey Council of Economic Advisors completed last week says New Jersey just finished a boom year but can expect to experience slower growth this year and in 2002. Still, economists say, even with a big national downturn, the state is in position to land softly.
With unemployment still low, many companies are scrambling for skilled workers even as others like Lucent are laying them off. This dichotomy has not escaped Mr. Taylor, who until he was handed his pink slip Feb. 15 was a network systems engineer for Lucent just since September and before that a 19-year employee of AT&T.
"It is kind of strange," said Mr. Taylor, a 43-year-old father of two, from his home in Irvington. "I still think -- even though I know there is a downturn in the economy -- that there are still a lot of opportunities out there. I don't think the economy is at a point it's so bad folks can't find a job. I think for me it's finding the right one."
Nationally, manufacturing jobs have been disappearing, high-tech stocks have been dropping in value and the stock market in general has been in a funk. The gross domestic product registered its weakest growth rate in five years: 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter. And wholesale prices climbed 1.1. percent in January, the steepest monthly gain in more than 10 years. 
So in the midst of all this, how is New Jersey faring, and what is the outlook? Not bad, according to a number of experts.
"The slowdown is here, but we are well positioned to weather it and, when the national economy picks up again, to continue the strong growth we've seen over the years," said Joseph J. Seneca, an economist at Rutgers University who serves as chairman of the New Jersey Council of Economic Advisors. "The New Jersey economy has been so good for so long, any slowing feels like a shock, but we're still growing and our economy is fundamentally sound." 
James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said, "The downturn or slowdown is going to be much softer in New Jersey than the nation as whole." He noted that New Jersey has become more diversified and less dependent on manufacturing, which accounts for 11.5 percent of jobs -- down from 33 percent in 1970 -- compared with 14 percent for the nation. 
Caren Franzini, executive director of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, a state agency that provides financing for business development, said: "We have not seen a decline in businesses seeking finances. What we've seen is businesses being more cautious just in terms of their borrowing needs."
Christopher Biddle, a spokesman for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said, "While the layoffs are dramatic, the unemployment rate is still low -- so low that employers will have no difficulty finding work for people who have been laid off."
Noting that a survey released by the association found that 80 percent of businesses reported having trouble finding skilled workers, Mr. Biddle said, "Even with additional workers, employers are still going to have difficulty finding the workers they need to fulfill their business expansion plans."
Dr. Seneca's report cited a tight labor market as a problem area for the economy. Others include inflationary pressures like rising prices for fuel and homes, low office vacancies and declining retail spending.
On the plus side there is "a diversified portfolio of vibrant growth industries," so-called "growth clusters," including information technology, research and development, pharmaceuticals, finance/insurance, logistics and entertainment, which added jobs at a 2.3 percent annual rate.
The report says the economy should continue to grow because of continued economic gains in New York City, which affect the region, decreased reliance on manufacturing and a substantial backlog of nonresidential construction. Commenting on the construction, George Nagle, secretary of the Council of Economic Advisors, said, "It will provide a very good basis for continued investment in the state." 
The report says that employment last year grew by 61,000 jobs to a total of 3.9 million, an increase of 1.6 percent. It was the fourth consecutive year the number of new jobs exceeded 60,000. But the report also predicts job growth will dip somewhat, growing at a rate of 1.1 percent this year and 1.2 percent the next, by about 45,000 jobs a year. 
New Jersey ended the year with an unemployment rate of 3.8 percent, according to the New Jersey Department of Labor, the lowest since 1988. At year's end, the national rate was 4.0 percent; it is now at 4.2 percent. January figures for New Jersey are scheduled for release on Tuesday.
"There may be less fizz in the boom," Dr. Seneca said. "Certainly the national economy is slowing, particularly in manufacturing, but New Jersey completed a very good year. For 2000 there were over 60,000 jobs added, very strong retail sales, strong income growth, but certainly a slowing in all those numbers by the end of the year."
The report noted that the gross state product, the measure of all goods and services produced in New Jersey, grew 6.0 percent in 2000. The growth rate is expected to be lower, 4.8 percent this year and 5 percent in 2002. Personal income grew 5.8 percent last year but is expected to grow at more slowly in the next two years, 5.2 percent and 4.7 percent. 
The consumer price index, a measure of inflation, rose 3.1 percent last year, owing mainly to energy price increases, but the report foresees inflation remaining at 2.5 percent for the next two years.
Dean Hughes said the real danger was that fears of recession on the part of the public could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. "We can summarize that in a phrase," he said. "Can gloom doom the economy?"
Oneil Taylor, who lost his job at Lucent, is not planning to go the gloomy route. He sees the time he spent at AT&T and Lucent as giving him valuable experience he can build on and has faith he will find a job quickly.
"I can look at the negative and I can look at the positive," he said. "I tend to focus more on the positive aspects."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
When You're No. 3 (Maybe), It Pays to Take a Long View

BYLINE:  By Iver Peterson; Iver Peterson reports from New Jersey for The New York Times.

DATELINE: LAWRENCEVILLE 

 BODY:
Undaunted by a solid record of almost nonexistent election support, the Green Party has jumped back into state politics by recently nominating Jerry L. Coleman, a consultant, as its candidate for governor in this year's campaign. 
 Never mind that nobody who was not either a Democrat or a Republican has won the governorship of New Jersey since Charles S. Olden was elected in 1859 on the Opposition ticket, which combined Whig, Republican and Know-Nothing elements. On top of that daunting record of two-party dominance, no third party in New Jersey has yet managed to even become a minor player, either by winning a solid minority of votes or by forging mutually helpful ties to a big party, the way the Liberal and Right to Life parties in New York often ally themselves with the Democrats and Republicans. 
 If that weren't discouraging enough for an insurgent in New Jersey, the two parties this year are comfortably aligned in the way that leaves hardly any cracks to pry open since Jim McGreevey, the likely Democratic candidate, and Donald T. DiFrancesco, the Republican, largely agree on major issues like gun control, abortion rights, open space preservation and reducing the impact of property taxes. 
None of this discourages the many people who dislike having their choices limited to the Big Two, as the number of minor parties that fight their way onto the ballot each election cycle proves. They may not agree on much, but they all believe they are building a movement, and Joseph A. Fortunato, a Montclair attorney and the chairman of the Green Party, is no exception.
"Basically we're in this for the long haul," Mr. Fortunato said, "and it may take us 25 years to establish ourselves as other Green parties have around the world."
Mr. Coleman said, "Jim McGreevey didn't win the first time but he might this time, so who knows how I'll do the next time."
It's true that there is a tradition in New Jersey of "losing to win," or running once to get name recognition and again to win, but only if you're a member of the Big Two. Even if the Greens are willing to be patient, they are certainly off to a slow start, especially for a party claiming to motivate disaffected voters. 
In the last gubernatorial race Madelyn R. Hoffman, the Green candidate, got 10,700 votes, barely a third as many as Richard J. Pezzullo, the New Jersey Conservative Party candidate, and a fraction of the number won by the dominant "third" party candidate that year, Murray Sabrin, who won 114,000 votes in a race that Christie Whitman won with 1.13 million votes.
It's hard to motivate the unmotivated in times of general tranquillity, said Ross K. Baker, a Rutgers political science professor.
"Minor parties serve as a safety valve for people who have a 'curse on both your parties'," Dr. Baker said, "but in New Jersey there have not been a lot of issue around which minor parties can galvanize."
Insurgencies worked well for Ross Perot in 1992, when the economy was faltering and Mr. Perot was able to mobilize a lot of voters over his opposition to economic pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement. But on other issues, notably taxes, the major parties have managed to usurp the terms of the debate and left the minor candidates jumping up and down at the fringe of the debate, waving their arms for attention.
The Greens face another problem this year, in the bitter aftermath of Ralph Nader's raid on Democratic votes in last year's presidential election. The resulting anger among rank and file Democrats, especially among key groups like union members and environmentalists, is going to work against the Greens this fall.
So far, Mr. McGreevey seems unconcerned about being Naderized by Mr. Coleman. His spokesman reacted to the announcement of Mr. Coleman's candidacy with a Zen-like yawn, saying that the Mayor of Woodbridge was working on an approach that went beyond party labels.
Still, it would be a mistake to regard the Greens as uniformly addlepated lefties who are unable to adopt more mainstream positions, since some of the party's candidates appear to have taken up causes that are downright appealing to New Jersey's famously middle-of-the-road voters.
Bruce I. Afran, a Princeton lawyer who was the Green candidate in last year's United State's Senate race, campaigned in part on maintaining a strong military and defense of Israel, and Mr. Coleman said he would steal a page directly from the Republican playbook by promising a tax cut, in his case, a one-third cut in the state sales tax, to 4 percent.
"I think we can live with a reduction in the sales tax," Mr. Coleman said, sounding a little bit like Christie Whitman in 1993. "The important thing is to run on the issues the people think are important."

More Space for Children to Swing a Bat

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
Little Leaguers celebrated an early victory two weeks ago when the Battery Park City Authority agreed to build two green ball fields with stadium lighting along Warren Street on the north end of Battery Park City.
 The authority, which is the state agency that oversees Battery Park City, has also agreed to set aside nearly twice as much indoor recreational space in nearby buildings as it had proposed last year. 
 Parents and children had pushed hard for the deal, in which a temporary playing field will be replaced by the two new permanent baseball and soccer fields. 
"I'm thrilled," said David Feiner, a Little League coach who is on Community Board 1's youth committee. "There are so many kids here that the league started turning some away."
Timothy S. Carey, the authority's chief executive, said the agreement balanced the needs of the community and economic realities.
Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, whose district includes the growing neighborhood, said the plan was expected to get the City Council's support on Tuesday. Financing for the project, which will cost $29 million, needs approval from the city. DENNY LEE

Quick Lessons in the Fine Old Art of Unwinding

BYLINE:  By ANDREA HIGBIE 

 BODY:
GOT stress?
 Of course you do. And you are in very good (and very crowded) company. Competition is driving many people to work harder and run faster -- in both good and not-so-good economic times. 
 While it is known that stress can make you ill -- causing heart, stomach and headache problems, along with sleeplessness, fatigue and depression -- not everyone may realize the heavy toll that it also takes on the economy.
Stress costs American businesses about $10,000 annually per employee, in absenteeism, lower productivity and increasing health and workers' compensation costs. That's an overall economic impact of about $300 billion, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health estimates that 40 percent of the nation's work force is affected by stress, making it the No. 1 reason for worker disability. 
In recent years, many employers have tried to roll back the tide by offering perks like stress-management classes, in-office massages, nap times during the workday and even laughter clubs. Well-meaning as they might be, not everyone can take advantage of them. (For some people, taking any time off from work or from responsibilities at home is, well, too stressful.) And not everyone is disciplined or knowledgeable enough to handle stress on his own by setting up a daily exercise regimen, learning to meditate or modifying a diet.
Solutions to the problem, as with so many others these days, can be found on the Internet. One self-help Web site, www.stressdirections.com, was created in 1999 by Alma Dell Smith and Lyle H. Miller, clinical psychologists who run the nonprofit Biobehavioral Institute and Treatment Center in Brookline, Mass., which each week counsels 150 clients, referred through corporations and physicians. They also head Stress Directions, a six-clinician consulting company. The Web site includes a "stress navigator" that measures a person's stress and helps to treat it by advising changes in behavior.
Dr. Smith and Dr. Miller offer an uncommon perspective on handling stress in both the workplace and at home. They have worked together over the last two decades, collaborating on the books "The Stress Solution" (Pocket Books, 1993) and "Stress and Marriage" (Pocket Books, 1996). And they have been married to each other for 16 years.
They also have their own way to relieve stress. "We love to dance, especially ballroom dancing, and that's very important to us," said Dr. Smith, 54. "Dancing is fun. It keeps me alert, on the ball and it feels good."
She and Dr. Miller, 73, said they spent 12 years developing the navigator. More than 500 companies, universities and government agencies have used it, including I.B.M., Gillette, BellSouth, AT&T, Polaroid, the Navy and the passport agency of the State Department, said Carolyn L. Krusinski, who founded Stress Directions with Dr. Smith and Dr. Miller. 
Dr. Smith describes stress management as a three-legged stool, with the legs representing work, family and community. If someone is stressed or burned out at work but has a solid home and community life, life goes on. If he has a good connection with his community but problems at work and home, things are getting shakier. When all three are amiss, get ready to topple. "That's a hard situation for anyone," Dr. Smith said.
More than 25,000 people have used the stress navigator online and 500,000 have taken the test in its original, pencil-and-paper format, Dr. Smith said. The navigator identifies sources of stress, susceptibilities and symptoms. It also provides specific suggestions as well as resources like books, other Web sites and organizations to help alleviate stress and treat its symptoms. "It's not like having a one-on-one talk with me," Dr. Smith said. "But it is tailored and relevant to the person taking it."
EMPLOYEES of participating companies can take the test at their desks. The responses and results are confidential, so employers receive only a group overview, not a specific employee's test results. "We give companies an organizational stress profile, saying 'out of your 1,000 people, X percent have this level of stress and here's why and here's what to do,' " Dr. Miller said. 
Stress is increasing over all, Dr. Miller said, with half of adults suffering negative effects and having trouble managing their stress levels. Ms. Krusinski says the highest stress levels are found among people who deal with the public, including police officers, teachers and social workers, and employees in financial services.
The navigator stress profile is intended to help businesses find the roots of stress in the workplace and to reduce its effects on the bottom line by lowering health benefits costs and employee turnover.
At BellSouth about five years ago, managers suspected that job-related stress was hurting productivity in certain departments. After the employees took the test, Dr. Smith and Dr. Miller pinpointed the stress as originating mostly at home instead of at work. They advised BellSouth to address the problem by offering workshops on family issues. Employees could participate at no cost but on their own time, Dr. Smith said. As a result, stress levels dropped and productivity rose; health care costs and absenteeism also declined. The company said it was unable to provide specific numbers.
I.B.M. has also found the program useful, said Jana Weatherbee, a vice president for corporate issues. "It's customized for I.B.M. and points you to I.B.M. resources that might help you," she said. "If you're experiencing financial stress, it might point you to the I.B.M. program that reimburses you up to $250 for financial planning assistance from Merrill Lynch or American Express. We've offered the program for about two and a half years, and the fact that it's a Web program works well because a large portion of our work force is remote or mobile."
Anyone can take the test on the Web site at a cost of $70. The 264 questions are divided into three sections: susceptibility to stress, or how well you take care of yourself; sources of stress, including job, financial or child-care problems; and symptoms, including headaches and sleep difficulties. After completing the test, clients receive an on-screen assessment with advice.
Correcting stress-related problems, however, takes time -- around six weeks for acute stress to a year for chronic stress -- whether through therapy, medical help, job training or the willingness of the stressed person to make changes, according to Dr. Miller. People often stay in stressful situations because the thought of changing is scarier than not changing.
ONE key to relieving stress, Dr. Miller and Dr. Smith say, is to have fun. Participation in at least one enjoyable activity a week helps to cancel out some of the week's stress and to build optimism. 
At least twice a month, without fail, the couple, who live in an 1850 Victorian town house in the South End of Boston, go ballroom dancing. "The music is beautiful," Dr. Smith said. "We laugh. We see our friends."
Dr. Miller also plays basketball and follows other sports in order to relax. Dr. Smith does gardening and yoga and refuses to work more than 30 hours a week. "I go off duty," she said.
"Perfectionism can be a major stressor," Dr. Smith added. "Change what you can. And avoid stresses like difficult individuals, even traffic jams, if you can. Having a good sense of humor is so important. Don't take things too seriously."
"I still get rattled," she said. "I just try to recover quicker."
What advice might they have for a mother of two school-age children who works full time, has next to no time for herself, is regularly sleep-deprived and is, coincidentally, facing a deadline for this article?
"Start with getting more sleep," Dr. Smith said. "Go to bed even 20 minutes earlier a night than you have been."
That may be easier said than done, but Dr. Smith and Dr. Miller say the best insurance against stress may be as simple, and complicated, as love.
"Giving and receiving love and affection," Dr. Miller said, "is powerful medicine for mind, body and soul."

Taming the Tension
A test from Stress Directions, a consulting company, includes a section on stress susceptibility. Test-takers respond to these sample statements on a 1-to-5 scale, with 1 meaning almost always, and 5 meaning never. The higher the score, the higher the susceptibility. 
* I eat at least one balanced, hot meal a day, and get at least seven hours of sleep a night.
* I am in good health.
* I exercise at least twice a week.
* I regularly give and receive affection.
* I have at least one relative within 50 miles on whom I can rely.
* Income meets basic expenses.
* I organize my time effectively.
* I get strength from my religious beliefs.
* I do something fun at least once a week.
* I speak openly about my feelings.
* I take quiet time for myself.
* I have an optimistic outlook on life.

Asking Americans To Build Their Savings

BYLINE:  By Vivian Marino 

 BODY:
There is no denying that the decade-long economic expansion has enriched many Americans. Yet huge numbers of people have little to show for those years of prosperity, other than the homes they own. 
 In fact, more than half of American households continue to live virtually from paycheck to paycheck, according to the Consumer Federation of America, which last week announced a campaign to encourage people to save and invest more. 
 The federation, a nonprofit group, released results of two studies showing the tenuous financial condition of many families. One of the studies, based on a federation-sponsored survey of 1,637 adults, found that 53 percent said they often lived from paycheck to paycheck. The percentage rose to 64 percent for households with annual incomes of $20,000 to $50,000 and to 79 percent for those with incomes of less than $20,000.
Over all, 60 percent said they needed to save more.
The other study analyzed the latest Federal Reserve survey of consumer finances and found that the typical American household had total net assets of $71,700 -- most of it in home equity. But net financial assets, or assets minus debt, totaled only $9,850 per household, including money in retirement savings plans. Among low- and moderate-income households, the median net financial assets amounted to less than $1,000.
Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation, said he was concerned that a weakening economy would worsen the situation. "A slowdown will persuade many American families to make a greater effort to pay off consumer debts and increase their savings," he said. "But it will be more difficult."
The federation's campaign, partly financed by the Bank of America, is scheduled to begin in Cleveland next month and in Kansas City, Mo., in April. It will be expanded nationwide. Vivian Marino

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
What Brings A Bear Back to The Market

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
IN nature, bears hibernate in winter. But on Wall Street just now, it is hard to find many of them asleep.
 Pessimism and doubt have trumped irrational exuberance. Worries abound over corporate profits, stagflation and overleveraged consumers. Once clear and bright, the future of technology stocks is out of focus. 
 Bears prey on this sort of stuff. But now and then, they feel like shopping.
Steve Leuthold, president of Leuthold/ Weeden Capital Management in Minneapolis, has been a notable bear for years. But lately he has been buying a lot of stock. He took some time last week to talk about why he came out of his cave. Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. You have been a market pessimist for years, yet the fund you manage, the Leuthold Core Investment fund, invests in stocks. When did your equity holdings bottom out? And when did your attitude start to change?

A. My bias is to be a buyer, not a seller. But in April of last year, equities were down to 17 percent of the portfolio. The fund was up 23 percent in 2000, and that is one reason why. We were playing defensively.
Our attitude started to change around the first of the year. I feel more constructive about things. We are finally getting rid of some of the terrible excesses in technology and the Internet. The rest of the market is reasonably priced. 
We raised our stock exposure then, and increased it again at the beginning of February. Now the fund is 60 percent stocks.

Q. So you think the market is poised for a rally? Aren't you worried about a recession?

A. I am looking for a kind of bifurcated bull market, with not much action in the technology stocks but with a fairly decent market in many other areas, including consumer goods and health care.
I think the economy will probably contract this quarter and again in the second quarter, but I don't think things will get too bad. 

Q. So when do you expect stock averages to start turning up?

A. Normally, two cuts in the discount rate by the Federal Reserve Board has been a pretty good buy signal, and we have had that. Usually, the market bottoms out about midway through a recession. So you may be approaching the bottom toward the end of this quarter.

Q. What do you make of the fact that pessimism seems awfully deep right now?

A. One of the things that concerns me is that most Wall Street analysts have never dealt with a recession.
We just did a study from 1947 to date. During that period there were nine years where earnings on the Standard & Poor's 500 fell by 5 percent or more. In each of those nine years, the stock market was up. By contrast, there were nine years when S.& P. earnings were up 20 percent or more. Five of those years were up years in the market. Three were down years. 
One of the things younger people don't realize is that markets turn up in the middle of recessions. They have all become so earnings-momentum oriented they overlook that. You have to remember the market is a discounting mechanism, and you have to look ahead.

Q. You said that some of the excesses have been wrung out of technology. Do you expect prices in that sector to fall farther? Also, do you own any technology stocks?

A. Historically, the median price-earnings ratio for the tech sector, which includes 500 stocks, is 33 times earnings. Right now we are at about 47 times earnings. That is a lot closer to the norm than the 114 times earnings they were at the peak. Technology stocks are getting interesting. At the moment 4 or 5 percent of our portfolio is in some technology stocks that have been beaten up.
Avant is one; Park Electrochemical is another. Milacron, the old Cincinnati Milacron, is a third. 

Q. What have you been buying recently?

A. Earlier this month, we bought a package of department-store stocks, including Federated Department Stores, Nordstrom and Dillard's. An industry play.
A lot of our analytical work shows the stocks are selling at 50 percent of sales.

Q. Are there other areas of interest?

A. I think life insurance stocks look really cheap. They have been beaten down recently due to concerns that the estate tax will be abolished. People were saying estate planning represented 60 percent to 70 percent of their business. But it is really only about 10 percent. I don't think the estate tax is going to get eliminated. And stocks like Lincoln National and Torchmark look pretty cheap.

Q. Have you sold out of any positions?

A. We recently sold the drug stocks. We had been in them for a year and a half, and I am beginning to think there are going to be some interesting constraints put on the drug companies in terms of pricing.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Subaru Outback H6-3.0 L. L. Bean Edition; 
A Melting Pot With All-Wheel Drive

BYLINE:  By BOB KNOLL 

 BODY:
WHEN Subaru introduced the Outback version of its midsize Legacy six years ago, the traditional station wagon seemed headed for oblivion, elbowed aside by the minivan and the sport utility. Who would have thought that all-wheel drive, an evocative Australian name and some rugged-looking trim could transform an innocuous Japanese wagon into a cult car for the Snow Belt?
 Whatever the reason, the Outback proved to be a tremendous hit, and it revived the formerly slumping automaker. Before long there was a whole range of Outbacks -- there are six variations for 2001 -- that account for the majority of Subaru sales. 
 A significant redesign of 2000-model Legacys and Legacy-derived Outbacks brought many improvements. (The smaller Outback Sport is a different animal, based on the compact Impreza.) The wagons grew three inches longer and became smoother and sleeker. A revised rear suspension added 5.2 inches to the width of the cargo hold. The familiar four-cylinder engine got more power and became more fuel-efficient. The ride was made smoother and the handling crisper. The brakes were enlarged and improved. And a Subaru trademark, full-time all-wheel drive, remained as functional and unobtrusive as ever. 
So for 2001, as Subaru faced the task of improving on a successful redesign, it did what car companies usually do: it added power and came up with a marketing gimmick. The power comes from a new six-cylinder engine -- the company's first six since it discontinued the sporty SVX coupe in 1996. The gimmick is an agreement with L. L. Bean, the Maine-based purveyor of outdoor gear, to use that company's name on a fancier Outback, the H6-3.0 L.L. Bean Edition.
This car is a cross-cultural experience: a station wagon designed by a Japanese company partly owned by General Motors; named for the Australian interior; built in the heartland of the United States (in Lafayette, Ind.); and embellished by the designer label of a Yankee outfitter from New England.
The 3-liter, 6-cylinder engine is all new, and at 212 horsepower it has 47 horses more than the four-cylinder power plant in lesser Outbacks. But like that engine, it is horizontally opposed, or "flat," an anomaly for a family car.
Subaru says the engine has inherently little vibration, and the six is indeed smoother and quieter than the four. The "chuffle" sound familiar to Subaru owners is gone, and the engine delivers smooth and powerful response, especially at medium speeds.
The new six is used in two new Outback models, the L. L. Bean Edition and the H6-3.0 VDC. The VDC has the company's first stability-control system, which it calls Vehicle Dynamics Control. The system applies the brakes at individual wheels to keep the car going where it is pointed -- potentially preventing a spinout -- but its operation could have interfered, under certain conditions, with the two existing all-wheel-drive systems (one for automatic transmissions and one for manuals). So Subaru developed a third drive system that operates as smoothly and easily as before and is also compatible with the stability control.
The L. L. Bean Edition has that retailer's logos affixed to each front fender, embossed on the leather seatbacks and embroidered on the floor mats. Ford has done essentially the same thing for years with its Eddie Bauer versions of the Explorer and Expedition. An association with an outdoor outfitter is a natural fit for a vehicle marketed as an enhancement to outdoor recreation; oddly, L. L. Bean's Web site includes only a brief mention of its namesake Subaru.
As befits its designer status, the $29,990 L. L. Bean wagon has a high level of standard equipment, including a power driver's seat, security system, auto-dimming rear-view mirror with compass, and air filtering for the cabin. Both the L. L. Bean and H6 VDC models have leather-and-mahogany steering wheels by Momo (which designed steering wheels for expensive racecars). One wonders how many Outback customers actually know or care about Momo.
The H6-3.0 VDC is priced above the Bean, at $32,390 including shipping. The Bean does not come with the VDC's stability control or its new drive system; it retains the excellent all-wheel-drive system previously used on Outbacks with automatic transmissions. The Bean also comes with free scheduled maintenance for three years, oil changes and tire rotations included.
All midsize Subarus have done very well in government and insurance industry crash tests. Safety improvements for 2001 include a front passenger air bag that inflates at one of two stages, depending on the severity of a crash; pretensioners and force-limiting features for the front seat belts; and attachments for new child-seat anchorages, which are easy to find because of labels right on the rear seatbacks.
Although the two new high-end Outbacks push Subaru prices into what the company calls "entry luxury" territory -- a land populated by the likes of Lexus and BMW -- less-expensive models are still around. Four-cylinder Legacy Outbacks run from $23,390, including shipping, for the base model with manual transmission, to $26,490 for the Limited with its standard automatic.
The two new six-cylinder Outbacks are nearly as expensive as several excellent all-wheel-drive wagons from Europe, including the Audi A4 Avant 2.8, the Volkswagen Passat 4Motion 2.8 and the Volvo Cross Country.
The L. L. Bean Edition that I tested felt familiar, since last year I drove a 2000 Outback Limited with the four-cylinder engine. The new six was most noticeable for its smoothness and silence on the highway. The extra horsepower was not all that evident, especially when not driving at full throttle, which I seldom do anyway. What was apparent, compared with four-cylinder Subarus, was the extra response at moderate speeds.
The fuel economy I achieved during my test drive was only about one mile a gallon less than with the smaller engine (about 23 m.p.g., compared with 24). According to the owner's manual, the six requires premium gasoline "for best performance," though regular may be used. When a manufacturer gives you that option -- another reason to read the manual -- I suggest that you take advantage of it, unless you think your wagon should behave like a racecar.
Ride and handling were the same as in the 2000 model: responsive and stable. The ride was especially impressive on secondary rural roads that tend to toss cars about unless their suspensions are well designed.
The automatic temperature setting for the heating and air-conditioning system worked quietly and unobtrusively, although I personally prefer to set the controls myself. The eight-way power seat was a welcome addition, allowing a comfortable fit behind the wheel.
Is the new H6 engine a significant step up that justifies the extra $2,400 to $4,800 over the four-cylinder Outback Limited equipped much the same way? Personally, I doubt it.
The lesser Outbacks can be dressed nicely, and they are worthy competitors. The L. L. Bean trim is so understated that the neighbors will have to look carefully to discern the status of your purchase. And the look of the H6 VDC is even more subtle.
Although a stability control is a wonderful device -- I think it should be mandatory on truck-based sport utilities, which need all the extra stability they can get -- it is hardly needed on a car as stable as an Outback. Unfortunately, the new government stability rating system gives no credit to manufacturers that equip their vehicles with this excellent equipment.

INSIDE TRACK: Crocodile Dundee goes Down East.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
A 'Miracle,' But Maybe Not Always A Blessing

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
RISING productivity is a wonderful thing. Income and living standards improve when companies find ways for their workers to produce more in each hour they spend on the job. But sometimes surges in productivity backfire, and this may be one of those times.
 The productivity miracle of the last five years takes for granted that people will buy the rising output of goods and services. Take away demand or reduce it, and the productivity payoff turns sour. The economy slows, as it is slowing today, and companies shed workers or cut hours, or both. Because they are more efficient, they need less labor, and unemployment becomes more of a problem than it would have been had productivity not surged. 
 "We are surely going to experience a pop-up in the unemployment rate," said Dale Jorgenson, a Harvard economist and expert on productivity. "The rise in January, to 4.2 percent from 4 percent in December, was just the beginning."
A pop-up in unemployment assumes that there really has been an enduring surge in productivity since 1995; that a new economy actually exists. Those who think so have concluded that widespread deployment of very fast computers and of innovative information technologies has raised permanently the level of corporate efficiency, in downturns as well as in booms. The unemployment rate will be a test, unfortunately, of the new economy's endurance. More endurance means fewer workers.
Productivity often rises in good times. Pressed to fill orders and to satisfy strong demand, employers push their employees to work harder and faster. Then, when the economy slows and demand eases, so does the extra effort and the productivity. The issue is how much easing. For many decades, there wasn't much. The productivity growth rate averaged nearly 3 percent a year. 
But then, in 1973, corporate America lost its knack for efficiency, and for more than two decades, productivity grew at an insipid 1.3 percent a year, on average, and the growth rate of the entire economy fell in tandem. The White House and the Federal Reserve shifted their focus. They stopped concerning themselves with ways to augment demand, so that it would keep up with the ever-rising supply of goods and services. Instead, they discouraged demand, usually through higher interest rates, so that it would not outstrip supply and increase inflation. Then, in 1995, productivity revived, to the old 3 percent level. 
Now the revival, a k a the new economy, is being tested in its first downturn. If the new economy proves its endurance, the unemployment rate is likely to jump -- by one or two percentage points more than it would have risen in the old, less-efficient economy. On the other hand, if the wonders of the new economy have been exaggerated, then we are in for another stretch of meager productivity growth and thus meager improvements in living standards for most Americans. 
The mathematics of this process are easily illustrated. A company employs 100 people to assemble 1,000 refrigerators an hour. By installing computerized machines or reorganizing the assembly line, the company raises the output to 1,030 refrigerators, a productivity growth rate of 3 percent. Through raises, the workers can share in the income from the sale of the extra 30 refrigerators. 
They are likely to keep their raises in a slowdown. But if demand falls back to 1,000 refrigerators an hour, and the assembly line maintains its newly acquired efficiency, then jobs disappear, often through layoffs. The company no longer needs 100 workers to assemble 1,000 refrigerators an hour. Five or six jobs are lost, and this process, multiplied across the economy, can help to turn a mild downturn into a very painful one. 
That happened during the Depression. Numerous innovations and market efficiencies raised the productivity growth rate in the 1920's and 1930's, and as unemployment rose so did the outcry about "the effects on employment of increased productivity and technological change," according to a history of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Under pressure, the bureau began to measure productivity and job displacement in many industries. The information was deemed by the unions of the day to be "necessary in collective bargaining for dealing with the problem of technological unemployment."
Public works projects in the 1930's eventually absorbed hundreds of thousands of displaced workers. That sort of government spending is out of fashion today, of course. The main tool for reviving the economy is concentrated in the Federal Reserve's power over interest rates. And the surge in productivity, which the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, has welcomed so joyously, is now, in the short run, a potential burden.

HEADLINE: Is a Battered Dell Ready to Rebound? 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

 BODY:
AFTER years spent basking in the sun of booming sales, makers of personal computers are finding their industry to be a cold, cheerless place.
 Demand has plummeted as the market reaches saturation. With consumers and corporations less eager to spend money on new machines, the resulting price wars have cut into profits, making the PC business increasingly difficult. 
 But the industry's growing pains may prove profitable for bargain hunters. Looking for deals among the gloom, investors are starting to place bets on the company that many analysts consider the most likely to emerge a winner: Dell Computer. 
"I think what the investor gets is very good value with limited downside," said Don Young, an analyst at UBS Warburg, speaking of Dell stock. He has a strong buy recommendation and a 12-month target of $35 on the shares, which closed on Friday at $23.06.
"He won't be hurt if he's early, and he's going to miss a heck of a ride if he waits," Mr. Young added.
Dell's strength lies in the efficiency of its business model. The company, based in Austin, Tex., sells built-to-order computers directly to customers. That allows it to keep little inventory and to take advantage quickly of falling component prices. As a result, Dell can offer lower prices.
The company used this model to increase sales 30 percent to 40 percent a year during its glory days, as the Internet made the PC indispensable for millions of people. For the 1997-98 period, the company's stock outpaced competitors like Compaq and Gateway and was the No. 1 performer in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Shares hit a high of $59.68 in March 2000.
By the end of last year, however, weakening demand for PC's, combined with a general economic slowdown, sent shares of most computer makers tumbling hard. Still, Dell and Hewlett-Packard were the only major producers to beat the industry's average unit-sales growth of 14.5 percent in 2000, according to the International Data Corporation.
Choosing to cut prices to gain market share, Dell has warned analysts to lower their profit expectations for the current quarter, the fourth warning in the last six quarters. Dell shares lost 66 percent of their value in eight months, hitting a low of $16.25 on Dec. 21, before rallying.
"We haven't executed over the last several quarters as crisply as we can," said T. R. Reid, a Dell spokesman.
Despite the general slowdown, which dragged down its shares more than those of most rivals, Dell has managed to strongly outsell many of its competitors. While the PC industry grew 10 percent in unit sales during the last quarter, compared with the year-earlier period, Dell said that its gain was 43 percent and that it increased market share in every part of the world and in every sector of the business.
Howard Ward, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Asset Management, which manages the $3.8 billion Gabelli Growth fund, attributed the stock's decline to a worldwide economic downturn, not to Dell's management. He praised the company as having "an impeccable balance sheet" and said it had used its buyback program to reduce outstanding shares by more than 300 million in five years. Mr. Ward has increased his stake to 2.5 million Dell shares, 1.4 percent of the fund's assets.
"You get the opportunity to buy the good stocks when the news is a little negative, a little cloudy and uncertain," he said. "If everything were rosy, we'd be talking about a $60 stock."
Many companies and industry experts have said they expect a general rebound in PC sales in the second half of the year, when Microsoft releases its new operating system and Intel distributes its new Pentium 4 chip more widely. Others warn that the year may end as dismally as it began.
Mr. Reid, the Dell spokesman, said desktop PC sales accounted for half of the company's revenue, which was $31.88 billion last year, and two-thirds of its operating profit of $2.77 billion. To lower risk in the face of the slowdown, Dell has pushed hard into more lucrative enterprise, or professional, markets, like servers and storage systems. Those sales rose 42 percent last quarter.
"Over time, we would like to continue to change our mix away from PC's," Mr. Reid said, though he said Dell would not abandon PC sales.
Richard Chu, a managing director at SG Cowen Securities, said he expected Dell's stock price to dip further before it recovered. It might slip into the high teens, he said, a level he suggested would be "a good entry point" for investors. "I think they have a fundamental strategy," Mr. Chu said of Dell, "that will result in them becoming more important, rather than less important, in the computer systems space."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 4, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about investing in the Dell Computer Corporation misstated the type of products that accounted for half of the company's revenue and two-thirds of its operating profit. They are nondesktop products, like servers, storage systems and laptops, not desktop personal computers.

HEADLINE: THE BUSINESS WORLD; 
At aFrench Factory, Culture is a Two-Way Street

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: VALENCIENNES, France 

 BODY:
FOR both Toyota and the workers at its new French plant, cross-cultural communication was a learning process.
 The French gave up red wine, a lunchtime staple, in the company cafeteria, while the Japanese, accustomed to docile company unions, accepted four trade union representatives on a company labor board. 
 And on Jan. 31, the first Yaris, a bulbous subcompact, rolled off the assembly line of the new, $570 million Toyota Motor factory near this northern French industrial city. The plant, designed to employ 2,000 workers, is Toyota's most modern and efficient factory, and its first on the Continent. 
The issue of wine arose when French labor ministry inspectors ordered Toyota to justify the ban. "We had to explain why -- health, working conditions," said Claude Boulle, a former labor ministry official who is now a Toyota vice president for administration. "This is a young generation; they drink to celebrate, not for nourishment." At ceremonies celebrating the production of the first Yaris, there was no Champagne, he said, a faux pas if there ever was one.
In addition to avoiding alcohol during the workday, employees gather for calisthenics -- at 8 each morning, before the first shift. The exercises are voluntary, but Georges Pierru, 35, a team leader, says he usually attends. "To avoid accidents, you don't start cold," he said, picking at a lunch of poached fish, rice and mineral water.
Mr. Pierru worked for Peugeot, the French automaker, before joining Toyota a year ago. Toyota, he says, is not Peugeot.
At Peugeot, there were early-morning meetings to discuss the day's production run. At Toyota, he said, there are meetings whenever a problem arises. Moreover, Toyota designed the Valenciennes factory to be 30 percent more compact than other factories with similar output, to curb building and operating costs and enhance communication. "Peugeot factories were bigger, so you were on the phone all the time," Mr. Pierru said. The Toyota factory's unusual layout, in which production lines meet at a central point, lets workers talk more easily.
Big stakes are riding on Toyota's getting it right here, as it struggles to increase its European market share, which, at 3.7 percent, is less than half its share in the United States.
The Toyota way differs from the French from the start. Unlike French companies, where diplomas and qualifications loom large, Toyota goes after unskilled workers, preferably with little or no auto industry experience, preferring to train them itself. And in a country where seniority is smart, at Toyota youth is king. The average age here is 27.
Cedrix Gut, 21, who has a degree in visual arts, works in the paint shop, after training for several weeks at Toyota's assembly plant at Burnaston, in central England. He had little trouble fitting in, except perhaps for the food. "There's an awful lot of rice," he said.
WHILE alcohol is absent, the cafeteria food is still largely French. On a recent day, there was steak, pizza, pasta, poached fish and a large selection of salads and cheeses -- as well as miso soup and steamed rice. There were few takers, though, for the chopsticks.
The cafeteria line was a wave of blue-and-gray windbreakers, with "Toyota" in red letters on the back and the employee's name on the front. Company attire is unusual for the French, who value individuality. Not even Toyota's offer, equally unusual for France, to supply free company work clothes has led most workers to accept more than the windbreaker. 
Toyota says the names on the clothing foster communication by making employees easily identifiable. But French workers, coveting privacy, shy from the practice.
If factory workers find names on clothing offensive, French executives find the lack of private office space equally intrusive. "It's very difficult, if you're not used to it, especially if you have to concentrate," said Mr. Boulle, 49, who sits at a low-slung desk in a large hall with dozens of other white-collar workers. Senior executives cluster in the center, with lower-ranking managers around the edges.
And Toyota, unlike French companies of its size, has no executive dining room. Managers dine in the same cafeteria as other employees do, but on a later shift.
Although much is at stake for Toyota here, the fate of the plant is also important for the Valenciennes area, a former coal and steel region of about 300,000 people where other heavy industry shut down in the 1980's. It now has an unemployment rate of 16 percent. Catherine Lenoir, who runs Toyota's hiring office, said that more than 30,000 people had applied for the factory's 2,000 jobs.
That has made relations with French unions, often cantankerous, more relaxed. Though the Communist union, the C.G.T., boycotted the labor-management council, other union leaders are conciliatory. "We want dialogue, to identify problems and put them on the table," said Pascal Honvault, 29, a team leader who represents the moderate C.F.D.T. labor federation. "Of course, we don't expect to resolve them all."
Hiroaki Watanabe, 59, who had managed plants in Canada and Britain, spent only 3 of the last 15 years in Japan before he was put in charge of the Valenciennes plant. "I thought this would be a very different experience," he said. But it wasn't really.
"I had knowledge of France," Mr. Watanabe said, "but in general more information is available in Japan about the English-speaking countries."
To prepare himself, he traveled to France as a tourist, discussed France with French Canadians at Toyota in Canada and even visited Toyota factories in Brazil and Argentina. "I came to the conclusion," he said, "that you had to learn French."
His first contact with the French, he said, was on trips to France to interview management candidates, meeting several dozen executives before choosing two vice presidents. "I was impressed," he said. "They were all very serious candidates."
WORKERS in northern France, he said, strike him as not very different from those in Britain and North America. "Perhaps more spontaneous, less inhibited," he said, adding: "That makes my work easier."
Like Mr. Pierru, Didier Leroy, 43, is an industry veteran. At Renault, he became the company's youngest assistant plant manager ever when he was 37, before Toyota made him vice president for manufacturing in 1998. For training, Toyota sent Mr. Leroy to visit its factories in Japan, North America and Britain. At Valenciennes, about 30 interpreters stand ready to interpret in French or Japanese. But much business is conducted in English, he said.
For the moment, about 200 Japanese are working at Valenciennes, including about 150 temporary trainers. When the plant is in full operation, by late next year, 24 Japanese executives will remain.
Toyota sent almost 400 newcomers to factories in Japan, Britain and Canada for training. Some knew bits of English, while others required interpreters. 
For his part, Mr. Watanabe, while fluent in English, insisted on conducting an interview in French, through an interpreter, to hone his comprehension. 
"I can understand most everything," he said, "but still find it difficult to express myself."

Putting 'Hostile' Back Into Takeover

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

DATELINE: WEST BEND, Wis. 

 BODY:
ANNOYED by the biting questions hurled at him at an industrial technology conference last November, William D. Gehl cut his presentation short. He gathered his materials, stuffed them in his briefcase, bolted out the back door of the conference room and walked briskly toward the exit of the Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.
 Behind him, two well-dressed men raced down the hall to catch up. Cutting him off at the escalators, Mark E. Schwarz introduced himself. "We're some of your biggest shareholders," he said. "We really should talk." 
 Mr. Gehl, the chairman and chief executive of a small manufacturer of construction equipment that bears his family's name, stopped. But he soon grew frustrated with the needling questions from Mr. Schwarz and his partner, Paul DeRobbio. 
"Gentlemen, this conversation is over," Mr. Gehl said he told them, shoving his way through the hotel's revolving door into the cold. 
A little more than a month later, the Gehl Company became the target of a fierce hostile takeover. In what may be a harbinger, with the stock market depressed, Mr. Gehl and his tiny $80 million company here are at the center of a takeover campaign not seen since the heyday of corporate raiders in the 1980's and early '90's. It features, besides shareholder attempts to oust Mr. Gehl and his board, a class action lawsuit, potential greenmail and, of course, bitter personal attacks.
Mr. Schwartz, 40, and Mr. DeRobbio, 41, were not just any shareholders. They had been quietly accumulating stock in the company since the summer. With more than 6 percent of Gehl -- which makes machines like forklift trucks and manure spreaders -- they had their own plans for it.
And they happened to hold an ace card: the backing of Harold C. Simmons, the Texas billionaire who made his name and at least some of his fortune taking on the management of Lockheed (now Lockheed Martin) and taking over NL Industries, a Houston chemicals company.
"This guy Gehl is a big fish in a small pond -- he's tapped out," said Mr. DeRobbio, chuckling as he sped around downtown Dallas on a recent Saturday, weaving between cars in his black Range Rover, the music blaring, after an interview at Mr. Simmons's office.
"We're Bill Gehl's worst nightmare," Mr. Schwarz said later. Mr. Schwarz, Mr. DeRobbio's more tempered alter ego, had been driving behind him -- though with more caution -- in a silver Jaguar.
How this small industrial company just north of Milwaukee could get caught in the cross hairs of one of Wall Street's most legendary raiders may appear odd. Odder, perhaps, this was not the first time.
Two years ago, the company became the target of another classic 1980's mover and shaker, James Dahl. Once a star salesman for Michael R. Milken's junk-bond operations, he later received immunity for testifying against him. Gehl bought out Mr. Dahl's 10 percent stake -- which he had bought on the open market -- for $14.9 million to send him on his way with a promise to keep quiet.
AND last summer, before Mr. Simmons, 69, decided to get hostile, he had teamed up with the investment fund of another Texas billionaire, David Bonderman, who years ago took Continental Airlines out of bankruptcy, to make an unsolicited offer for Gehl. But Mr. Bonderman's fund bowed out of the partnership in the fall, realizing that the takeover effort could get dirty.
Yet if any takeover fight brings back memories of the hard-charging, fist-pounding, corporate-raiding 1980's, it may well be the one for little Gehl. After expanding quickly to meet booming demand, last year Gehl found itself overextended and with too much capacity just as the economic cycle started to turn down.
"Are we corporate raiders or shareholder activists?" Mr. Schwarz asked rhetorically, his feet now propped up on a long mahogany boardroom table at Mr. Simmons's offices.
"These guys have every defense in the world," he said of Gehl. "He's got a fortress around him. It's the most egregious I've ever seen. They've got a poison pill. A staggered board. They've got it all."
In the lobby of Gehl's headquarters, a computer monitor flickers with the company's latest stock price of around $15 a share, up about $5 since Mr. Simmons made his buyout offer of $18 a share.
Mr. Gehl's office is on the second floor of the plain, two-story brick building, just off of Main Street in this town of about 28,000 people.
The wood-paneled office is modest; toy models of Gehl excavators and other equipment are proudly displayed on a shelf behind his desk.
"The approach to our business has been very studious," he said, seated with his suit jacket still buttoned. He took over the company in 1992, he said, when it was on the brink of collapse, saddled with $90 million in debt and wounded from $18 million in losses the previous year. "It was definitely a turnaround job," he said.
Indeed, Wall Street largely credits Mr. Gehl, 54, not only with saving the company from ruin, but also with reinvigorating the business for which his grandfather, Michael Gehl, worked as a sales manager and helped to build. Mr. Gehl refinanced the debt, hired managers, added plants and developed new products. He also made an acquisition of his own in 1997: the Mustang Manufacturing Corporation, for $28 million. A graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, he is not naive. 
During his tenure at the company, Mr. Gehl, who commutes to West Bend from Milwaukee's North Shore suburbs, has become a town hero. Besides participating in civic events and making donations to local charities, he -- unlike his father, who was a dentist -- is the first Gehl family member to work at the company since his grandfather retired in the late 1940's. 
And at a time when West Bend's other major employer, Amity Leather, was being bought out and broken up, Mr. Gehl managed to keep Gehl afloat. The company, with roots here dating to 1859, employs a more than 1,100 people at its various operations. Some 450 of the employees work in West Bend.
Still, in early 1998, the company began to feel pressure to sell out.
Mr. Dahl, who now operates his own private investment firm in Jacksonville, Fla., bought 5 percent of Gehl in mid-1997, starting when the stock was trading at $10.50 a share. Almost immediately, in an effort to drive the stock price higher, he began pushing Mr. Gehl to sell the company to the highest bidder. At one point, he tried to be appointed to the company's board, an idea that Mr. Gehl summarily rejected.
Upset at Mr. Gehl's refusal to consider selling the company, Mr. Dahl went on the offensive, speaking out against him and his motives. "If Bill were a rational, smart businessman -- he'd received enough overtures to know -- the big guys out there are willing to pay big prices," Mr. Dahl told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel then. "It's his own fiefdom."
At the time, his industry was in a consolidating frenzy, and Gehl was facing new competition from the likes of Caterpillar and Deere & Company, both of which announced plans to compete in Gehl's markets. Komatsu, one of the industry's giants, was seeking an alliance with, or outright acquisition of, Gehl, and Mr. Gehl traveled to Tokyo for talks. He came back to West Bend empty-handed, however, having rejected Komatsu's offers.
As the rumors spread that there were offers for the company, other shareholders also wanted Gehl to consider selling out. At the company's annual meeting in April 1999, James S. Schmitt, a Gehl shareholder, silenced the auditorium when he shouted out to Mr. Gehl, "Have you ever played musical chairs?"
"Yes," Mr. Gehl responded, irritated.
"Have you ever lost?" Mr. Schmitt shot back. 
Pausing, Mr. Gehl grinned. "No," he said.
But Mr. Gehl was under the gun. By the summer of 1999, Mr. Dahl had pressed Mr. Gehl's buttons so hard -- threatening to unload his entire position in the company -- that Mr. Gehl had to come to the bargaining table. Gehl's stock is thinly traded; only 5,000 shares change hands on an average day. If Mr. Dahl had tried to sell even half his position at once, there clearly would not have been enough demand, and the stock price would have dropped sharply.
GIVING into Mr. Dahl, Gehl bought out his stake at the market price of $20.50 a share, or $14.9 million. In exchange, Mr. Dahl agreed not to buy stock in Gehl for 10 years and not to speak publicly about the company.
So did Mr. Gehl get taken? Was he "greenmailed"? "They call it that," he said. "But we felt it was in the best interest of the shareholders. Jim Dahl decided he wanted to liquidate his position. He's history."
Other shareholders, though, were not as happy about the deal with Mr. Dahl as Mr. Gehl was. "He hasn't offered to buy back my shares," said William J. Nasgovitz, president and chief executive of Heartland Advisors, whose value fund started investing in Gehl in 1994 and has 330,400 shares. The value of his stake has dropped by about 25 percent in the last year. "I believed in Bill Gehl," Mr. Nasgovitz said.
Mr. Gehl countered, "He's had opportunities to make money and sell at higher prices."
The same summer, Mr. Nasgovitz began applying his own pressure on Mr. Gehl to consider selling the company. In July, Mr. Nasgovitz sent a critical letter with a proposal: he wanted the company to elect a committee, independent of Gehl's management or board, to explore selling the company. The letter also asked Mr. Gehl to relinquish his role as chairman -- arguing that he was unfairly controlling the fate of Gehl for his own benefit.
"Requiring a corporation's chairman of the board to be independent of its management ensures the independent judgment that applicable legal standards require of a board," Mr. Nasgovitz wrote. He received no response.
Gehl marched on, its stock price hovering at about $20. The company appeared on Forbes's list of the 200 best small-capitalization companies. It also made Fortune's undervalued businesses list of "Big Bargains in Small Companies." Then the market started to plummet. Gehl was overextended; its debt level jumped from about $30 million to about $60 million. Its stock began to drop.
"Heck, if I had my name on the door, I wouldn't want anyone to mess with my deal, either," Harold Simmons said of Mr. Gehl last weekend, as he stood in the lobby of his Dallas office with his golf spikes still on. "It's just human nature."
Mr. Simmons was paging through Fortune last year when he spotted Gehl on the undervalued list. He wrote away for the company's annual report. Coincidentally, Mr. DeRobbio, just two doors down, had already began researching the possibility of buying it. Mr. DeRobbio, a muscular, 6-foot-4 inch deal maker, went to Mr. Simmons with his idea. 
"When Harold and I got this harebrained scheme, I didn't know where it would take us," he said, sipping a 7Up in the kitchen of Mr. Simmons's office complex.
Last summer, they decided to approach the company. The plan would be to try to buy the company and then to resell it for even more to a competitor in the industry. With the backing of one of Mr. Bonderman's investment funds, Halifax, they contacted a banker at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (now a unit of Credit Suisse First Boston) to help set up an introduction. A brief meeting with Mr. Gehl proved fruitless. The company would not entertain an offer.
Undaunted, Mr. Simmons and Mr. DeRobbio, through their company, CIC Equity Partners, started buying stock in Gehl in bulk; the price was then about $18 a share. Mr. DeRobbio also called on Mr. Schwarz, the president of a Dallas hedge fund called Newcastle Partners, who is known for his feisty approach to waging proxy contests against obstinate management. Mr. Schwarz, too, began buying Gehl shares.
"Nobody in power owns stock at Gehl; that's the primary problem," said Mr. Schwarz, a boyish-looking 40-year-old dressed in a blue blazer, jeans and loafers. "You've got a chairman who's got his name out in the front and he only owns 1 percent of the company. He likes to match his initials on his shirt to the outside of the building." Indeed, Mr. Gehl only owns a small portion of the company, though a slightly higher figure than Mr. Schwarz stated -- 3.4 percent.
Mr. DeRobbio and Mr. Schwarz approached Gehl, sending a letter seeking to buy the company; they had planned to even offer Mr. Gehl a chance to continue running it.
They sent the letter to Mr. Gehl and to the company's eight-member board. "There was a concern that the directors weren't being informed, that Bill was acting as a gatekeeper," Mr. Schwarz said.
They waited for a reply. "He won't return my phone call," Mr. DeRobbio said, playing with a toy model of a Gehl earthmover. "By the way, that's the first thing I'd cut," he joked about the toy. "How much are they wasting on that?"
The last week of December, they decided to go all the way. They named a price: $18 a share in cash, a premium of 57 percent. On Dec. 22, a formal offer was on the table and made public.
Within four hours, Gehl's board publicly rejected the offer, deriding it on more than a half-dozen points. 
Mr. Nasgovitz of Heartland Advisors went ballistic. In a letter to Mr. Gehl and its board, he wrote, "It is difficult to comprehend how the board and management could have convened and given due consideration to an offer in a four-hour period on a Friday evening before a holiday." He asked: "Were all board members fully informed of the offer? Were any shareholders consulted? We certainly were not!" 
He added, "A board is elected to represent shareholders, not management."
Within weeks, two shareholders filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of all Gehl shareholders. The group accused the company of failing to duly examine the offer. And some shareholders accused the company of trying to later cover its tracks by saying it had commissioned a fairness opinion from an outside adviser, Robert W. Baird & Company, a Milwaukee brokerage firm.
MR. GEHL defended the action. "First of all, their move was not unexpected," he said. "This was not a knee-jerk decision. We were fully prepared. It is a ploy to put the company in play," he said of the offer. 
"We're under no obligation to sell," he added. "Our interest is not in satisfying vocal shareholders. We have the entire shareholder base to consider."
Mr. Schwarz begs to differ about Gehl's quick response to their offer. "They're trying to paper it over," he said. "Three weeks ago, I got a call from Steven Booth at Robert Baird," he said. "They said they were just hired to examine our proposal," he added. "It was a new engagement for them. Don't you think it's a little odd that they dismissed the offer and then hired the bankers after?"
Mr. DeRobbio and Mr. Schwarz are preparing to wage a proxy fight against Gehl. A typical proxy fight for control of Gehl would be almost impossible because of the many protection mechanisms that the company has set up under its corporate governance structure. Among them are a poison pill, which makes a traditional hostile takeover prohibitively expensive, and a staggered board, which prolongs proxy fights.
Instead, Mr. DeRobbio and Mr. Schwarz hope to take control of the company from the inside -- by trying to have themselves elected to Gehl's board at the next annual meeting in April and to vote Mr. Gehl off the board. Coincidentally, Mr. Gehl's three-year term ends this year. Mr. DeRobbio and Mr. Schwarz have filed their intentions to seek election.
"The board's not as independent as it might seem," Mr. DeRobbio said. "The blood runs thick in Milwaukee." 
But before the Texas buyout clan has a chance to get its way, analysts speculate that Gehl may resort to a common defensive measure: making a big acquisition of its own, to become less attractive. In its announcement of its fourth-quarter results, Gehl made a point of discussing such a possibility. Mr. Gehl went even further in an interview, hinting at doing a deal in Europe.
But he made one thing very clear. "The company is not for sale," he said. "Period."
As for the jabs thrown at his character, Mr. Gehl said nonchalantly: "I don't take these things personally. I don't view it as a personal attack. If you're operating a public company it comes with the territory."
What will happen to Gehl? An analyst at Credit Suisse, J. Blair Brumely, said in a recent report, "We are not entirely sure that the stalemate the company seeks to construct with this strategy will materialize, nor do we think an eventual sale of the company is guaranteed because of the management's deep-seated desire to remain independent."
His take on the situation: "We continue to find our greatest comfort on the sidelines as this piece of theatre unfolds."
On Friday, Gehl's stock closed at $14.63, up 37 percent since the offer was placed on the table. The market seems to be siding with -- or perhaps cheering for -- Mr. Simmons.

HEADLINE: TALKING MONEY WITH: MONICA SELES; 
Dual Focus: The Ball, the Nest Egg

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

DATELINE: SARASOTA, Fla. 

 BODY:
ANGER can be a destructive force, but for Monica Seles, rage over an attempt on her life eight years ago had a hidden benefit. It brought home to her the value of money.
 In 1993, at 19, she was already the No. 1 professional female tennis player in the world. That spring, Gunther Parche, a fan of her rival, Steffi Graff, stabbed Ms. Seles at a tennis tournament in Hamburg, in full view of the stunned crowd. 
 The wound sidelined her for two years, cost her the No. 1 ranking and led to severe depression. It also cost her more than $1 million. 
Today, Ms. Seles, now 27, is recovered and in control of her life. But the experience made her aware that she could suddenly lose the ability to earn money and left her determined that her earnings would be invested to provide financial security. These days, she watches her spending, monitors her investments closely and, occasionally, even suggests investment strategies -- like the "Dogs of the Dow" theory -- to her advisers.
At a recent interview over lunch at a country club near her home here, she wore a blue-jean skirt and a cotton blouse and carried a Kate Spade handbag, projecting the image of the generally cool, businesslike and somewhat distant woman that even her friends describe as "private."
In the mid-1980's, at the age of 13, she left Yugoslavia for the United States, armed with killer strokes and her trademark hefty grunts. There was no time then to think about investing. Ms. Seles's older brother, Zoltan, handled the family's funds conservatively, watching the contracts that she signed and investing her winnings safely. That was fine with her.
"I never asked about the finances," Ms. Seles recalled. "I wouldn't dare." When it came to spending, she was similarly uninvolved, just wanting enough money, she said, "to get the teddy bears that I liked." Mostly, she added, "I just wanted to play tennis." 
The stabbing halted both her playing and her income. Under German law, when she sued the German Tennis Federation for lost income and damages, she had to post a percentage of the $16 million she was seeking. Then, when she lost the case, Ms. Seles had to forfeit the money she posted and pay the federation's legal fees. (She also brought a suit against Mr. Parche, who was given a two-year suspended sentence on the assault charge.) 
The experience hit Ms. Seles hard. "I realized: 'Grow up here. Money talks at the end of the day,' " she said with a trace of a Hungarian accent -- reflecting her upbringing as part of the Hungarian minority in northern Serbia.
"From that point, I just wanted to know where every dollar goes." Ms. Seles added in a soft but firm voice.
The trauma -- and the gradual realization that Mr. Parche would never be punished -- also proved emotionally devastating. Ms. Seles experienced a series of severe depressions over nearly two years. Only psychiatric help and the support of her family brought her back to competitive tennis, she said.
During her long physical and psychological recovery, however, she had both the desire and the time to consider her financial affairs more closely. "I realized that there is no justice in it at all, and I thought I better look into everything," she said.
Ms. Seles certainly did not want for money. At the time of the stabbing, she was worth several million dollars. Today, her lifetime tour winnings total about $13 million, and there have been many product endorsements, including a five-year, $25 million promotional contract with Nike that just ended and an $18 million deal from Yonex, which makes sports equipment. She also earns an estimated $1 million a year from exhibition matches and appearances. All told, Ms. Seles is probably worth about $40 million, several people close to her estimate. 
Of that, roughly $5 million is invested in real estate: her walled, 5,500-square-foot, French chateau-style home, complete with a tennis court, in a gated community here; a beach house in another Florida city and an apartment in Europe. (For security reasons, Ms. Seles declined to provide locations.)
MS. SELES is usually a cautious consumer, too, friends say. Tony Decello, the financial account executive who handles Ms. Seles's investments at McCormack Advisors International of Cleveland, said: "She is fastidious about what she spends. Many athletes look at how much they make and how their investments are doing, but they ignore budgeting and lifestyle. They end up growing into a lifestyle that they can't sustain. It is a very slippery slope.
"Monica is not like that," he added. "She is always asking about inflation, about whether she will be able to maintain her lifestyle. She's aware that her income is coming down."
Ms. Seles is now the fourth-ranked woman tennis player in the world, and will compete next month in the Ericsson Open in Miami.
"Ever since she came back from the attack, she has wanted data on her total tennis income and off-court income, and her expenses and receipts," Mr. Decello said. "She tracks things in a very strict fashion -- what she spends and what she makes."
In fact, he added, "she is just like the people in 'The Millionaire Next Door' who drive old cars and save money," referring to the best-selling book by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko. 
Martina Navratilova, a longtime friend, says the same cautious attitude is evident in Ms. Seles's tennis game. "She is not necessarily a risk taker," Ms. Navratilova said. "She plays her points as aggressively as possible while being as safe as possible."
And Mr. Decello, who has known his client since 1988, added, "In a world where many athletes have three cars or more, and lust after private jets, she is unusual." Ms. Seles drives a Toyota Land Cruiser that she won in a 1998 tournament in Japan. The only car she has ever bought was a Ford Explorer, which she has since sold.
Her investments are equally conservative. Following Mr. Decello's advice, Ms. Seles has placed 44 percent of her approximately $35 million in liquid assets in stocks. An additional 29 percent is in tax-free bonds, 8 percent in real estate investments and the remainder in cash. Her stock portfolio includes large-capitalization, blue-chip stocks like General Electric, Coca-Cola, American International Group, Home Depot and AOL Time Warner. The average annual return of the equity portion since 1996, counting dividends, was 19.03 percent through 2000, Mr. Decello said. In 2000, when the market was down sharply, it declined 20 percent. 
Ms. Seles has an overall goal for that portfolio: "What I put in the stock market, I don't have to touch in my lifetime," she said. "I want to live off my bonds. I want to be that safe." 
That means that she has about $450,000 a year -- the income generated by her tax-free bonds -- for her personal life. She keeps well within that limit, spending about $360,000 a year on her homes and private expenses. 
Mr. Decello says Ms. Seles calls him more than most of his other clients do. "We send her a monthly check, and she will ask questions about things like the interest rate on her bank account or her retirement plan and how it works for her," he said.
Ms. Seles says she asks other questions, like: "Why we are picking stocks right now? And, why we are buying more shares of the same stock when it is so high? Why don't we sell some shares and buy real estate?" 
To educate herself, Ms. Seles said, she has read some books on finance, including "What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School" by Mark H. McCormack, "One Up on Wall Street" by Peter Lynch and John Rothchild, and "Only The Paranoid Survive," by Andrew S. Grove, the Intel chairman. "I read that because he is also from Hungarian descent," she explained, "so it made me see how these people came out of a very difficult time."
Ms. Seles, whose father, Karolj, died of cancer in 1998, said she has developed a close relationship with Mr. McCormack, who heads IMG, the sports marketing firm that is a co-owner, with Merrill Lynch, of McCormack Advisors International. 
She can sound almost childish in her deference to him. "I get to pick a certain amount of stocks out of my portfolio," she said. "The rest of them Mr. McCormack picks. I am lucky to have advisers whom I trust." Mr. Decello, working with the firm's investment team, actually picks the stocks, which Mr. McCormack approves. Ms. Seles also talks about her finances with Jerry Glauser, a family friend in Sarasota. 
A year ago, she grew interested in the Dogs of the Dow theory, an investment strategy that picks the 10 stocks of the Dow Jones industrial average that begin the year with the highest yields, typically because their prices have lagged behind those of other Dow stocks. "If the dividend yield is high, that means the share price is down," Mr. Decello said. "The theory is that it will go up."
Under Mr. Decello's direction, Ms. Seles has bought ExxonMobil, Kodak, J. P. Morgan Chase, 3M and others. "It is 3 percent or 4 percent of her portfolio," Mr. Decello said. "We usually recommend that you do a little investing with your own money." 
Currently, that group of 10 stocks is down 1.75 percent. 
Typically, investors who use the theory swap those stocks for the new "dogs" at the start of each year. "We are starting to do that now," Mr. Decello said. 
Sometimes, Mr. Decello has to talk his famous client out of an investment. "They hear stuff in the locker room," he said of athletes. "A lot of our time is spent telling them not to do things." He talked her out of Transmeta, a chip maker that went public last year. It began trading last November at $45 a share, failed to rise and is now trading at $30.94 a share. 
But that was unusual. Usually, Ms. Seles tends to err on the side of caution, in large part because of her upbringing. 
She was born in Novi Sad, in northern Serbia. Her father was a well-known cartoonist for a local newspaper, Magyar Szo, and did freelance work. Her mother, Ester, did office work for a government agency.
ALTHOUGH not wealthy by American standards, her family was part of Yugoslavia's upper middle class; it even had a small summer house in Croatia. 
But she soon learned that living standards were far higher in the West. When her brother Zoltan decided, after seeing Bjorn Borg play on television, that he wanted to learn tennis, her father drove 10 hours to Italy to buy his son a tennis racket -- children's rackets were not available in Yugoslavia. Later, he did the same for his daughter.
The children practiced in a parking lot behind their apartment building, guided by their father, who had found a 20-year-old book on tennis at a local bookstore. To make practice amusing, Mr. Seles, who would remain his daughter's trusted coach for years, painted cartoon characters' faces on the tennis balls. 
When it came to spending, her father "was into nice things," Ms. Seles recalled. It was her mother, who still lives with Ms. Seles, who worried about budgets. "She was the bookkeeper and a big saver," Ms. Seles said. "She taught that money didn't grow on trees, and you have to sensible." 
Ms. Seles played in her first tournament when she was 6, and soon began winning tournaments across Europe. Later, she made the plane reservations for her trips because she spoke the best English in the household. She always found the cheapest fares, having learned quickly that her family's finances did not go far in other countries. 
That awareness deepened after she arrived in the United States. Nick Bollettieri, who runs the Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Bradenton, Fla., invited her to train there in 1986. The school's roster of stars includes Jim Courier, Anna Kournikova and Andre Agassi.
There she found how frugally she would need to live. "It was different when I came to the States," she said softly. "If I wanted a blanket, I couldn't get it because the dollar is so different. Plus, at the academy there were very wealthy kids. It was different for me. 
"I had to think: 'Gosh, we can't have this. We can't afford this right now.' "
But money was not her driving force. What Ms. Seles wanted was to win, and she said she realized that "back home in Yugoslavia, in December and January, you couldn't practice; I would take Florida any day."
Even after she started winning big money in 1989, she never became a big spender, though she has had her share of indulgences. There is the green Chanel suit that she bought for herself after defeating Ms. Graf in the 1992 French Open. "I think it cost about $2,500 then," she said. She tried it on the day before the match, promised herself she would get it if she won, and went right back to Chanel the morning after her victory to fetch her reward. But she has worn it only once. "I felt it looked too grown-up for me," she explained.
A friend, Mary Joe Fernandez, a former professional tennis player, says Ms. Seles likes to shop, especially for jewelry ("We like to go to Tiffany's"), handbags (Kate Spade), and shoes (her current preference being is J. P. Tods). Ms. Seles said she used to be a "Manolos" addict, referring to Manolo Blahniks, the super high heels favored by the fashion-conscious. In fact, she accumulated more than 30 pairs. But no more. "I don't have anyplace to go in them," she said, "and they destroy my feet." 
When it comes to big-ticket expenses like travel and homes, Ms. Seles watches costs assiduously. Even today, she keeps a "tickler" file to remind her of her totals of frequent-flier miles, which she uses to drive down air travel costs.
When she travels for matches, she always takes along a small entourage, including her mother.
"I have to worry about expenses: my coach, my trainer, my physical therapist, airlines and hotels," Ms. Seles said. "That adds up to a huge number. I will fly coach and I will fly first. You don't want to get too comfortable. No matter what people say, you do get spoiled. If I am going on a trip and I am not doing anything for five days, then I always fly coach. My people fly business or coach -- never first." (Her mother sits next to her.)
Perhaps it is her mother's influence, but the staff at the Sarasota home does not include a housekeeper or a gardener. Ms. Seles and her mother clean the house themselves, and they employ a groundskeeping company to care for the property.
HER desire to hold on to capital is deeply ingrained. "For me, the biggest thing with money has always been independence -- just the biggest," Ms. Seles said. "It has always been freedom. I don't care about anything else. If I find the person that I love, it is because I love them, not because I will be dependent on them."
She does not necessarily view this obsession with independence as positive.
"My mom asks me about it," she acknowledged. "I am trying to an extreme to be independent. I know it is too much and I am trying to change it and let people in." 
Her only public romance was with Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft. One friend of his, who requested anonymity, said the pair appeared very happy together at Mr. Allen's birthday party in Venice in 1998, but that romance is long over.
The death of her father, and her role as the sole support for herself and her mother, clearly weigh on her. After all, she competes in a sport in which most players retire in their early 30's. 
"I don't know how long I'll play," she said. "Part of me would like to fall into business," she said, "and part of me would like to do something with kids. Maybe I will do an internship at some company that I really admire." For now, she acknowledges, "I don't know where life will take me."
Her parents always taught her that "money comes and goes," she said, and that "you've got to be the same person regardless of whether or not you have it." 
She also lives by the words on a plaque that Mr. Glauser gave her, a financial take on the Ten Commandments. "The first commandment is, 'Never underestimate the value of money,' " she said. "and the second is, 'Never overestimate the value of money.' "

HEADLINE: Fighting AIDS in Africa 

 BODY:
The recent announcement by the Indian drug company Cipla that it would sell AIDS therapy for $600 a year or less to African countries is a step toward commuting the death sentences now hanging over the 25 million Africans infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. A year and a half ago, few people even dreamed that the citizens of poor nations would be able to get the antiretroviral drugs that have turned AIDS into a manageable disease in rich countries. Now, each week brings new developments on fighting AIDS in poor nations, and a stronger international consensus that poor countries can provide treatment to those infected and improve their prevention campaigns to slow the spread of the virus. None of this will be possible, however, without leadership from the Bush administration, which must take a more aggressive role in combatting AIDS abroad than its predecessor.
 One reason for the worldwide movement on AIDS is that the dimensions of the apocalypse are beginning to sink in. The AIDS virus is a plague that now afflicts one in five adults in South Africa. Throughout Africa, it is eroding economic growth and killing the most productive people. It could bring about the social collapse of many countries, creating instability and humanitarian crises. 
 Bush administration officials recognize that AIDS has become a foreign policy issue for the United States. Secretary of State Colin Powell has called AIDS an economic and national security problem and said Congress has been generous. But Congress's allocation amounts to only $315 million this year for all AIDS programs worldwide -- vastly inadequate to prevent the catastrophic scenarios looming in Africa. An effective prevention program throughout Africa -- the very minimum necessary -- would cost $1.5 billion, according to the United Nations program on AIDS. Relieving the pain of AIDS sufferers and treating their infections would cost a similar amount, and providing drugs to attack the AIDS virus would cost even more.
The Cipla offer has greatly increased the possibility that poor nations will be able to treat AIDS, especially if it provokes brand-name drug makers to lower their prices, as it seems to be doing. A year of therapy costs $10,000 or more in the United States, but several multinational drug companies have negotiated far lower prices with some African countries, as low as $1,000 a year, and now Cipla will sell generic drug cocktails for less. But even at $600 a year, these drugs are out of reach for most Africans. Wealthy nations are going to have to pay for the drugs -- which could initially cost $3 billion a year for Africa, and more as a greater number of patients are reached. The West must help African nations improve their health care delivery systems so they can properly administer these drugs -- an effort that would reap many other health benefits as well.
America need not take on this financial burden alone, but it must assume part of the responsibility. That will require the Bush administration to multiply its allocation for AIDS in the third world substantially. Just as important, the administration must abandon its predecessors' policies that blocked access to cheap drugs in poor countries in the name of protecting the patent rights of American drug companies. 
The pharmaceutical industry, whose donations favor Republicans, is likely to be even more influential with this president than it was with Bill Clinton. But the first sign from the Bush administration is encouraging. Trade officials indicated last week that Washington will not use trade to pressure poor nations that seek to make or buy generic AIDS drugs, as long as their efforts fall within world trade rules. The Clinton administration had used such tactics but abandoned them after criticism from AIDS activists. Many feared they would now be revived. The Bush administration should also work with Unaids and the World Health Organization to improve access to needed medicines. The means now exist to treat the sick, if America will help.

Firm Foundations for Disaster

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia 

 BODY:
THE number of killings in this country's grinding civil conflict tops 5,000 a year. Paramilitary gunmen, once shadowy killers who operated in a few regions, have spread across the country. And rebels, despite agreeing to resume peace talks, continue to threaten the state.
 To many in America, Colombia's problems can be summed up in one word: cocaine. But the strife tearing at Colombia has roots that predate the drug trade, anchored in festering, decades-old disputes over land, worsened by the lawlessness of Colombia's vast countryside. 
 They reach back into the 19th century, when land-owning strongmen ruled like feudal lords. Indians were pushed off tribal lands; whole communities were driven into the Andes. 
In the 20th century, the problems solidified and spread, with peasants driven from their plots as demand rose for the commercial production of coffee and other crops. Land struggles evolved into the country's greatest blood-letting, La Violencia, a 10-year orgy of violence in the 1950's that pitted members from the traditional Liberal and Conservative parties against each other. It started here in Bogota, with the 1948 murder of a populist Liberal presidential candidate, and quickly moved out to the countryside. 
Today's rebel movements began then, as did early versions of today's right-wing paramilitaries, who worked at the pleasure of the land owners. In the end, some 200,000 people died -- all decades before Colombia became the center of cocaine trafficking. 
And though the power-sharing agreement that officially ended La Violencia greatly diminished the conflict, it created a deeply flawed political system that excluded millions. These problems afflict every corner of Colombia by virtue of the simple fact that the central government has never really governed much of this country, a land of towering mountains, jungles and wide-open plains twice the size of France. In hundreds of towns, government officials have been inefficient or corrupt. In others, government is completely absent.
The result has been economic stagnation, poverty and violence in much of the countryside, leaving millions stuck in a feudal world in which coca farming, or membership in one of many armed bands, makes perfect sense. In cities, too, violence has increased since the 1980's, when cocaine kings began rising to prominence and drug gangs battled for the spoils. 
"We live under a state that has no presence," said Ivan Marin, a historian at Javeriana University in Bogota. 
"You can attack the problems of narco-trafficking and make a case for it, but the problem of narco-trafficking isn't just the illicit activity or the coca crop," he added. "It's also finding a suitable economic activity for peasant farmers that gives them enough earnings to have social benefits, like education, health care, communication, justice."
Human rights activists point out that Colombia is awash in conflict-related violence, massacres and selective assassinations. The deaths are often said to have their roots in the drug war; the reality is that most are political. 
And the numbers keep rising, mostly in the countryside. The Colombian Commission of Jurists, a respected human rights group, says the number of conflict-related deaths now exceeds 5,000 annually, possibly nearing 6,000. On average, only 4 of the 14 daily conflict-related deaths occur in combat. Most, they note, are perpetrated by right-wing paramilitary groups, run by one Carlos Castano, groups that have long drawn support from big land-owners. And there is another terrible statistic: criminal homicides, most of them drug-related, number at least four times the conflict slayings.
Colombia experts say American policy would be better if it was informed by the complex history and culture of Colombia, everything from the roots of rural violence to its rich literature and political intrigue, topics often as hard to decipher as the fog-shrouded Andes. 
"People just look at the slices of Colombia's complex reality that they want to look at," said Mr. Shifter, who works at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington research group. "The real challenge, it seems to me, is to get off this inability to see beyond the drugs. It requires a real understanding of magical realism, of the complexities and subtleties. That is not exactly the strength of United States policy toward Colombia." 
AND even if the Bush administration moves toward addressing Colombia's problems more comprehensively, many here find deeply offensive the idea that Colombia -- a country that, despite its problems, has modern, functioning cities, a large middle class and a rich cultural life -- is in need of nation building. 
And yet some try to sidestep that term while hoping for the kind of aid that falls under it: help rebuilding its battered judicial system, economy and government. 
"What preoccupies the United States is drugs, but they should focus on being a good neighbor, in other words showing concern for the other side," said Luis Felipe Gomez, director of the Program for Peace, an organization that works on peace issues in conflict zones. "By de-narcotizing the relationship, we would recognize each other as equals, with dignity for each state."

With a Focus on Israel, It's Business as Usual

BYLINE:  By Robert D. Hershey Jr. 

 BODY:
The combination of acute political tension in the Mideast and a meltdown of the Nasdaq composite index has not dissuaded the sponsors of a new mutual fund that invests in small Israeli technology companies that trade on Nasdaq.
 "You'd imagine we're at a pretty tenuous point," said Cliff Goldstein, president of Amidex Mutual Funds in New York. 
But prospects are actually bright, he contended, citing virtually nonexistent Israeli inflation, healthy inflows of venture capital and the type of stocks -- "no dot-coms, telecom companies with earnings" -- in which the new fund, Amidex Israel Technology, invests. 
 The fund, which has no load, or sales charge, opened to the public on Feb. 15. It is linked to an index of 35 Israeli companies with market capitalizations of less than $1 billion.
Unlike the firm's first Israeli fund, the two-year-old, $30 million Amidex35, which buys large-cap Israeli issues trading in both Tel Aviv and the United States, the new one will have no exposure to the shekel. Expenses run 1.45 percent a year.
But Amidex, founded in 1998, also has its eye on market niches other than Israel. The next entries are to be a fund that will concentrate on companies engaged in the detection and treatment of cancer and a fund to invest in brokerage houses and mutual fund managers, Mr. Goldstein said.

Singing Those Technology Blues, Again

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
The stock market was pounded last week, with two major indexes ending at or near their lowest levels since the market highs last March. But investors managed to limit the damage with a rally late Friday as rumors circulated that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates even before its next policy meeting in late March. 
 In what has become a regular feature of the market slide, there was a steady beat of bad news in technology. Motorola said it would likely record its first loss in 15 years in the first quarter. Sun Microsystems, Brocade Communications and EMC also issued profit warnings. 
 By Friday afternoon, though, speculation grew that the slowing economy would make the Fed cut rates as early as next week.
 The Nasdaq ended the week at 2,262.51, down 162.87, or 6.7 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 finished at 1,245.86, off 55.67, or 4.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average ended at 10,441.90, down 357.92, or 3.3 percent. 
 The sell-off in the equity markets and the rate-cut rumors bolstered the bond markets on Friday, but the yield on the 10-year bond still finished at 5.09 percent, unchanged for the week. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

HEADLINE: Maryland Farmers Turn From Tobacco to Flowers 

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: PRINCE FREDERICK, Md. 

 BODY:
More than three centuries after Maryland took root as a lush English tobacco colony, the last tobacco farmers are renouncing "the money crop," as it long reigned, to take a bittersweet state buyout that guarantees them an income for 10 years. 
 In return for swearing off tobacco, the farmers will be subsidized as they look for ways to survive by growing crops like flowers and organic vegetables for the fancy restaurants just over the suburbanized horizon. They are raising hay and horses, too, for the new country homeowners arriving in this region bordering Chesapeake Bay, about 50 miles southeast of Washington, at a record pace. 
 "No farmer wants to see houses growing on his fields," said Buddy Hance, standing in his barn recently with the last tobacco crop to be raised by four generations of tobacco-growing Hances. It will go to market next month. 
Mr. Hance will become an experimental farmer looking to strawberries and hothouse flowers, having taken the buyout to join the 70 percent of the state's remaining 950 tobacco farmers who have submitted applications in this opening year of the offer.
"By next year, I expect we'll have just about all of them," said Mr. Hance, a leader of the Tri-County Council for Southern Maryland, a regional planning group covering Maryland's three tobacco-growing counties, Calvert, Charles and St. Mary's. 
Perplexed by a shifting world tobacco market and helped by the cigarette industry's mammoth damage settlements with the states, tobacco farmers in the United States have begun trying an assortment of strategies for adapting to new markets, with official help. Virginia and North Carolina, for example, have set up foundations with money from the settlements to help farm communities look for industry and to offer college scholarships to the children of farmers so they can learn new occupations.
"But no other state has anything similar to Maryland's program," said Lee Dixon, who tracks health policy changes for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Maryland's tobacco crop has been dwindling for the last 20 years, Mr. Dixon noted, leaving a smaller group of tobacco farmers more open to sweeping innovation than in the larger tobacco states.
Gov. Parris N. Glendening decided on the buyout approach last year, viewing tobacco as a product without a future in Maryland. With the agreement of legislative leaders, he is tapping 5 percent of the tobacco industry settlement in an effort to keep farmers on the land as part of what he calls a "smart growth" strategy of protecting rustic traditions in development areas. The rest of the state's $4.5 billion settlement is paying for medical research and education programs to ween smokers from cigarettes. 
"I worked barefoot behind a horse in the tobacco fields when I was 12 years old," said Hagner R. Mister, a tobacco farmer who quit two years ago when Mr. Glendening made him state agriculture secretary. Since then, Mr. Mister has helped farmers shape the only direct buyout program for tobacco farmers. It offers guaranteed income for a decade based on each farmer's crop volume for the 1998 season, at a three-year average of recent market prices, which is $1 a pound. 
Those with the largest farms, approaching 100 acres, will receive $60,000 or more a year in the buyout, says Christine L. Bergmark, development director for the Tri-County Council. But the average buyout will be about $10,000 yearly, Ms. Bergmark says, since many farmers were already part-time tobacco growers forced to work multiple jobs after a 1982 drought. 
Since then, with land and labor costs rising, the state's tobacco crop of 35 million pounds has slipped to about 11 million pounds. Nationally, tobacco farms have declined to 89,700 from 188,650 since 1987.
"Farming is a lifestyle but it's also a business," said Mr. Hance, explaining why farmers are accepting the state offer. Tobacco farmers who do not accept the offer immediately will have later opportunities to do so, but for smaller amounts. 
"There are a lot of advantages in knowing you have an income stream for 10 years while you experiment on new things," Mr. Hance said. 
"But the bad part is we've given up the right to ever grow tobacco again," Mr. Hance said, "and we have so many people signing up that we're going to lose our state market. If we don't find anything to replace it, what do we do?"
Historically, the buyout is a major turn from Maryland's heritage as the source of the once-prized air-cured tobacco that the cigarette industry needed for its steady, slow-burning properties, until modern chemical additives. Along with religious tolerance, tobacco was rated the signature virtue of colonial Maryland.
"Tobacco is our meat, drink, clothing and monies, being the standard of trade not only with the merchants but with ourselves," Hugh Jones, rector of Christ Church in Calvert County, declared in 1698.
The attraction of the buyout is strong, although tobacco continues to be the single most profitable crop a farmer can raise in this region, Mr. Hance said. "The labor issue is the No. 1 reason why farmers are signing up for the buyout," he said, referring to the increasing problems of maintaining a reliable flow of seasonal fieldworkers for the crop, which must be cut, stored and stripped by hand. 
The "absolute best" workers, Mexican immigrants who are paid $10 an hour during the summer-to-fall tobacco season, found better opportunities in the booming economy, Mr. Hance said. Now, tobacco is being produced abroad by workers who are paid far less. 
"In the old days, we'd wait for those autumn nights with the big harvest moon when we finished cutting tobacco and you'd walk around the barn and smell that stuff," Mr. Mister recalled. "You'd pick up two tobacco bundles and shake them and the prime stuff rattled like money. Tobacco was everywhere. Now you have to search for it around here." 
One reason the buyout is working is that the average age of tobacco farmers is 62 and the 10-year payout is seen by some as a retirement windfall. But not by Earl Griffith, who is in his 60's but sticking with tobacco -- though his 40-year-old son, Jack, a successful grower, is taking the buyout because his future seems more uncertain. "My Dad's already tried growing everything under the sun, but nothing replaces the profit margin of tobacco," Jack Griffith said. "It's a sin they ever messed with tobacco, the crop this country was built on. Since I was big enough to walk I knew what I wanted: work the tobacco fields with my dad and granddad."

HEADLINE: Palestinians, Hit by Curbs, Foiled in Use Of U.S. Aid 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
Israel's increasingly strict controls on the movement of Palestinian goods and people are paralyzing United States government economic development projects in the Palestinian territories, American officials here said as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell arrived in the region today. 
 Building projects have been paralyzed by Israeli import restrictions, and local participants in economic training programs cannot travel freely to courses within the territories or abroad, diplomats said. The United States has been investing more than $100 million yearly in development projects in Palestinian areas. 
 American aid officials here were especially irked this week when Israel refused to let a high-level delegation of Palestinian economic officials and private business leaders travel to a long planned series of seminars at an American-run economic institute in Rome and the World Trade Organization in Geneva. Financed and organized by the United States Agency for International Development, the seminars were intended to foster Palestinian compliance with international norms regarding intellectual property rights and foreign trade policies. 
"We urge the Israelis to cease their policies of economic pressure against the Palestinians, including limitations on the movement of people involved in important economic or business activity," Larry Shartz, the spokesman for the American Embassy in Tel Aviv, said today.
The delegation needed special Israeli exit permits for 17 of its 21 Palestinian members -- the others held American passports or were residents of Israeli-ruled East Jerusalem -- in order to travel to Ben Gurion International Airport, outside Tel Aviv. Though told initially by Israeli military authorities that the once routine permits would be granted, the delegation was informed shortly before the scheduled departure that all 17 applications had been denied. 
"It would defy logic to identify any legitimate security concerns for the State of Israel to justify its illegal actions in this matter," said Maher Masri, the Palestinian minister of economy and trade, who organized the delegation in collaboration with American aid consultants. 
The seminars were needed to help "the Palestinian Authority's efforts to move the Palestinian economy into the era of globalization," Mr. Masri said. "This will entail a great deal of preparatory work that must be addressed through partnership efforts by the public and private sectors, through the empowerment of a technical advisory team of experts" on World Trade Organization norms and regulations.
Officials in the Israeli prime minister's office said they could not comment on the specific reasons for the decision to deny travel permits to the group, referring questions to the office of the Israeli Army, which handles civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories. 
Spokesmen for the Israeli military's Civil Administration Office said Israeli government policy now is to reject virtually all travel applications from Palestinians, even when there is no indication that applicants pose a security risk, unless high-level Israeli officials specifically endorse the request.

HEADLINE: White Flight, This Time Toward Harlem; 
Newcomers and Good Times Bring Hope, and Fears of Displacement

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
Few people doubted in recent decades that Harlem needed change. Now change has come -- and it is being met not simply with hope but with unease. Residents voice a complex tangle of aspirations and anxieties about class and culture and race that at least in some ways echoes fears expressed by whites during an earlier chapter of racial change in the neighborhood.
 In the restored buildings and new businesses of a reviving Harlem, many see encouraging signs of economic life; in the immigrants and other new arrivals, a welcome energy and flux. But there is also apprehension, talk of displacement, and what some perceive as a threat from outsiders moving in, a small but growing number of whom happen to be white. 
 Gentrification in Harlem is generating a byproduct: some measure of racial integration, although in a reverse form in a country in which integration has for the most part meant blacks moving into white areas. The process has renewed discussion of the virtues and limitations of gentrification and integration, and has exposed ambivalence about each. 
Long seen by most Americans at least in the abstract as a social good, racial integration is getting a mixed reception in Harlem. Arriving hand in hand with gentrification, it has kindled what one scholar called a kind of cultural nervousness that is somewhat reminiscent of the mix of class anxiety, cultural discomfort and racial fear seen in white ethnic communities that resisted integration in the past.
"African-Americans -- especially economically impoverished and socially vulnerable African-Americans -- can be motivated by the same mix of motives when they look at what's happening with intrusions into their neighborhoods," said Jonathan Rieder, a sociologist at Barnard College who specializes in race and identity and in the 1980's wrote a book about black-white conflict in Canarsie, Brooklyn. "And African-Americans, with their long memory of exclusion from white neighborhoods, have much invested in a feeling of comfort with their own kind."
Monique Taylor, an associate professor of sociology at Occidental College in Los Angeles who is working on a book on recent gentrification by blacks in Harlem, said: "The mistake that people make sometimes in these gentrification battles is to simplify who are the insiders and the outsiders and who are the good guys and the bad guys. In the case of Harlem, I think everybody wanted to see whites as being outsiders and as bad guys. Once you get there and realize there are white and black outsiders and white and black insiders, it's a more complicated thing."
Harlem is in some ways unique because of its history and symbolic importance in black culture, a fact that seems to heighten the response to change there. But similar changes have been playing out in varying degrees in neighborhoods elsewhere, from Fort Greene in Brooklyn to parts of the South Side of Chicago and sections of Detroit. George Galster, a professor of urban affairs at Wayne State University in Detroit, said that in that city, "You hear black community leaders literally saying the following thing: 'Now that we have made the city worth something, they want it back.' "
During the 1960's, 70's and 80's, he said, "Blacks saw whites fleeing a sinking ship. But, by golly, it near completely sunk, and in the 1990's it has actually started to rise in the water. And blacks take pride in that. And now they say, 'Gee, wouldn't you know it? Now the rats want back on board the ship.' "
Attitudes in Harlem vary from household to household, individual to individual. It is impossible to generalize about the opinions of homeowners and renters, old timers and newcomers, business owners and customers. All that can be said is that views about the implications of Harlem's revival are widely mixed.
"Some feel if it's not overwhelming, it is good because it does bring some diversity to the community," said Lionel McIntyre, director of the Urban Technical Assistance Project, part of the urban planning program at Columbia University. "Some feel that black folks just can't have anything: 'Every time you look around, they want it' -- that kind of sentiment. Then there is cautiousness about what is the real intent. Does it stop at reaching a racial mix or go to one group taking over the other?"
Mary Pattillo, an assistant professor of sociology and African-American studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and a former Harlem resident, said: "If Harlem becomes integrated, is it still Harlem in the way everybody says Harlem and has a vision of it? My personal opinion is, I would like Harlem to stay a black neighborhood and a strong black cultural space. But my political and policy opinion is that I know that segregation allows neighborhoods to be strangled."
What is happening in Harlem differs in several ways from integration of the more familiar black-to-white form. For example, when black people moved into white neighborhoods, there were in most cases little income or class differences between the two groups. But when middle- or upper-middle-class people move into lower-income, minority communities, what takes place is as much class -- as racial -- integration.
Whereas whites may have feared that the arrival of black neighbors would provoke white flight and depress property values, residents of gentrifying neighborhoods fear rising property values will force them out. If they do not believe they are under the risk of actual displacement, they may worry about a loss of political control and the erosion of customs, rituals and institutions -- what Monique Taylor calls "a way of living in black communities." 
Setha Low, an urban anthropologist at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, said, "I think the anxiety you're interpreting as fear of integration has more to do with the community, the people who have been there and made their neighborhoods their own for long periods of time, and who have close social relationships, losing the power and control they have over their own community." 
Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem said bluntly: "It's not a white and black thing. It's a dollar thing."
Gentrification raises questions even when race is not involved. It has reclaimed deteriorating neighborhoods and brought local economies back to life. But its benefits may be spread unevenly. As Mr. McIntyre wondered, can it be called community improvement if, amid gentrification, the schools and hospitals on which longtime lower-income residents depend continue to decline?
Communities want two contradictory things, said John M. Yinger, a professor of economics and public administration at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. They seek higher-income people to improve their neighborhoods, but want their neighborhoods affordable, to retain existing residents.
"The same conflict plays out probably with even more power when there's race or ethnicity involved," Professor Yinger said. "So if you have an established community of lower-middle-income blacks, for example, and higher income whites are moving in, then all of the feelings that come even without race get magnified."
Integration, too, is seen with some ambivalence. Americans say they believe in principle in equal housing opportunity, surveys show, but in practice, they seem less sure. Many studies have shown that white Americans stop moving into communities once a certain proportion -- roughly 10 to 30 percent -- of residents are black. 
"The current reaction of the African-American community in Harlem is like the reaction of many African-Americans who since the 80's have begun to question the goal of integration for integration's sake alone," said John Goering, a professor of public affairs at Baruch College and the City University of New York Graduate Center who has written about housing segregation and desegregation. "There is a fair amount of uncertainty as to what the African-American community, middle-income or lower-income, actually gets out of it and what the benefits of it are."
For those reasons and others, it has not been easy to maintain stable neighborhoods that are racially and economically mixed. Some believe the examples, though few, are increasing. Others find encouraging evidence in Los Angeles that the dynamics change when there are more than two racial groups in an area and no group dominates.
As for Harlem, Monique Taylor said: "Harlem is a great place to show America that integration can work. But it's not just about 'We move here and you move there.' You have to show people who you are, and be neighborly."

HEADLINE: More Sunshine for Japan's Overworked Students 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
Daichi Zaitsu, a seventh grader, has so much studying to do that he has precious little time to devote to his favorite hobbies: researching passenger jets on the Internet and playing tennis. Still, the 13-year-old thinks that plans to reduce school hours are a horrible idea. 
 "In Japan, the scholastic ability of people is not so high right now, and it seems to be decreasing, so I worry about the future of our country," said the teenager, who puts on a sober navy blue uniform and lugs a heavy book bag back and forth to his central Tokyo junior high school each day, including many Saturdays. 
 "Having more free time is not a particular concern of mine," he said. "I would rather school stay open on the weekend." 
Like it or not, the teenager's class schedule is about to change drastically as Japan undertakes its most dramatic educational reform effort in a generation. Starting next year, instead of piling on yet more work for its famously hard-studying students, Japan will let its young take a rest. 
The changes are in striking contrast to the most recent trends in New York, California and elsewhere in the United States, where schools are considering lengthening the school day or year in order to help children learn -- and to try to keep them out of trouble.
In recent decades, Japanese schools have developed a system that in some respects is what some American schools are talking about now: long hours, emphasis on basics rather than electives, school uniforms and a premium on order rather than on creativity. Yet just as some American schools are taking tentative steps toward such a system, Japan is talking about dismantling it. 
The reason is a growing concern that an orderly and unimaginative school system excels at producing pliant, disciplined workers, which the nation needed for its rebuilding effort after World War II, but is failing to produce the problem solvers and innovators needed for the future.
Japan has been floundering economically for more than a decade, and the change is meant in part to help ensure the country's ability to compete. Somewhat paradoxically, the drive to give millions of students more electives and unstructured time out of school for their personal use comes as public anxiety over dropouts, adolescent crime and what is perceived here as an epidemic of underachievement among the young is higher than ever. 
Some parents oppose the shortened hours for this reason, while many others fear that a lightening of the curriculum by an estimated 30 percent will make it harder, rather than easier, for Japan to compete with its rivals in Asia and the West. 
"The direction that New York City is taking is exactly the right direction," said Ryoko Zaitsu, Daichi's mother. "I wonder why this change is being made in Japan."
She speculated that the all powerful Ministry of Education was trying to remedy the problems of rough schools -- from elementary through high school -- by "trying to reduce everyone to the same level." 
Officials at the Education Ministry acknowledge that the problems of disaffected and poorly performing students enter into the thinking behind the changes. But they say the main issue is that year after year of overworking students has left people exhausted, and destroyed creativity and individual initiative, qualities officials say the country sorely needs. 
"Our current system, just telling kids to study, study, study, has been a failure," said Ken Terawaki, a senior Education Ministry official who nonetheless dismissed the idea that Japan and school systems in places like New York City were going in opposite directions on the scholastic escalator. Instead, he insisted, Japanese reformers were responding to features of their own country's culture and history that had no parallels in America.
"Endless studying worked in the past," he said, "when there were many kids in the school system, Japan was rebuilding and the competition was very fierce. But that is no longer the case, and the kids are far fewer, things are not as competitive anymore, and just telling them to study more will no longer work. 
"Now we are going to try the sunshine approach, giving them more chances to play sports, or read books. We would like to give them some free time and the psychological freedom to do things that they are interested in. In other words, we want to give them some time to think, rather than force everybody to stay in school to study the same thing."
Noboyuki Tose, a professor of mathematics at Keio University in Tokyo, is a prominent critic of Japan's education system, but opposes the planned changes because he fears that they will further drag down performance. 
About two years ago he began testing students at some elite colleges for basic mathematics aptitude and was shocked -- as was the nation when the results were widely publicized -- to find that many students were incapable even of elementary level mathematics. 
Mr. Tose said he traced the inability to Japan's traditional style of learning -- cramming -- and to a subtle shift that began more than 20 years ago that allowed high school students some electives and lighter classroom workloads.
Standardized mathematics tests suggest, he said, that Japanese students are among the best in the world in junior high school, when such classes are obligatory. But by high school, when the students already have more options, their performance in mathematics has already become mediocre.
"What is happening in Japan happened a long time ago in the U.S.," Mr. Tose said. Referring to an American white paper of the early 1980's that warned of a "nation at risk," because of falling educational achievement, he added: "There are a lot of similarities between the two countries, only a time delay of 20 years. 
"Twenty years ago the education in America was like eating in a cafeteria: high school students just chose what they wanted, avoiding mathematics and science and other difficult subjects. Japanese schools at this moment have exactly the same system. We don't need to increase students' free time. We need to reduce it."
At the secondary school level, however, many educators seem more enthusiastic about the changes, even if they harbor doubts about whether the announced restructuring alone would transform Japanese education.
"This reform is almost like an expression of remorse for the way Japanese people had to live after the war," said Eiko Iwatani, the principal of Daichi Zaitsu's Bunkyo Ward Junior High School No. 6, an almost antique seeming but colorfully decorated middle school of about 270 students in the shadow of Japan's most prestigious college, Tokyo University. 
"After the war," Ms. Iwatani said, "education was so important to our reconstruction that we resorted to cramming, education became automatic, and people didn't need to think for themselves. Nowadays, people are feeling that we are lacking in the faculty of creative thinking and problem solving."
The theory seems to have taken little account of parents' penchant for sending children to private after-school classes known as juku. However much bureaucrats plan to increase the free time of students and give them more freedom over their time, anxious parents continue to send their children to the juku, and many students, mindful of keeping up, are themselves eager to go.
Ms. Zaitsu sends Daichi to a juku three times a week, and a private tutor also goes to their home sometimes. All this costs the family about $400 a month, but they see it as a requirement.
"It shouldn't be necessary, but other parents will keep sending their children, so you feel that you have to, too," Ms. Zaitsu said. "Frankly speaking, I would like to start a revolt. But not everyone feels that way, so we are left with a feeling of helplessness. You want to do something but you can't move. In the end, you feel that you just have to take care of yourself."

The rain burst from the heavens and drenched the faces of the jubilant supporters who serenaded the old man at his birthday bash here today. All across town, young women celebrated the leadership of their longtime president, singing, "South Africa will follow you, Mugabe, Namibia will follow you." 
 But after two decades in power, President Robert Mugabe turned 77 this week with his popularity dwindling and his country in political and economic turmoil. The high hopes vested in him when white rule ended in 1980 have soured; at home and abroad, some who lauded him as a liberator say he is turning to autocracy to cling to power and to realize long-cherished goals, such as giving land to blacks. 
 And as they watch Zimbabwe and its leader, the men and the movements who helped end colonialism in this region are shuddering, worrying that they, too, may fall from their people's graces. 
It has been seven years since the last all-white government -- the apartheid regime in South Africa -- was finally voted out of existence. As euphoria at the triumph fades, many countries in this relatively stable corner of Africa are feeling similar strains. Voter apathy is rising; there is a struggle to deliver promised jobs and land to the poor; and opposition parties with large white memberships are wooing black converts.
In recent days, Mr. Mugabe has acknowledged his party's failure to inspire young blacks, who tired of his talk of revolution and flocked last year to an opposition party that promised to ease unemployment, even though it was partly financed by whites who once supported minority rule.
This morning, Mr. Mugabe announced that southern African leaders would soon meet to plot strategy and to rekindle the passion for their parties and ideals. "We feel threatened at the moment, and not just here," he said earlier this week. "In South Africa and Mozambique."
No one is seriously predicting that South Africa or the other law-abiding countries here will go the way of Zimbabwe, where Mr. Mugabe and his followers have been assailed by the United Nations, the State Department and human rights groups for arresting critics, harassing journalists and threatening judges.
And some in the region and abroad view the budding pluralism across southern Africa as a sign of progress in a place where one-party politics is still largely the order of the day.
But there is no doubt that the parties in power, which supported each other when all were battling to end colonial or white minority rule, are seeking new solutions now that putting black faces in City Hall no longer satisfies poor blacks seeking advancement.
"People cannot eat slogans, rhetoric or history; liberty must bring tangible benefits to the oppressed," warned Zwelinzima Vavi, head of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, at a seminar in Johannesburg last week, assessing the lessons of Zimbabwe for its neighbors. "This is also relevant in South Africa."
Mr. Vavi, whose group is closely allied with South Africa's governing African National Congress and with the Communist Party, described Mr. Mugabe's government as a "promising transformation project turned horrible." In the sharpest condemnation of recent developments in Zimbabwe by a South African leader, Mr. Vavi placed the blame for its troubles on the repression of critics and "near-dictatorial governance."
But even South Africa's leaders, who won 60 percent of the popular vote in recent elections, are nervous. A white-led opposition party won slivers of the black vote in that poll.
Officials in South Africa have vowed to root out corruption and to narrow the gap between officialdom and the masses. In Namibia, party members are talking about rallying alienated young people. In Mozambique, officials are warning about the threats posed by opposition parties with links to their old enemies. 
In October, top officials of what were once the parties of liberation gathered to discuss these issues. Today, Mr. Mugabe urged young activists from across southern Africa to stick with their governing parties to guarantee more black economic empowerment.
"We're asking ourselves, 'What lessons can we learn from each other?' " Jeremy Cronin, the deputy general secretary of the South African Communist Party, said in an interview. "It's very important for all of us to start to do that." 
Mr. Cronin noted the low turnout among blacks, especially the young, in last year's local elections in South Africa. "We can't simply expect people to vote because the A.N.C. fought a heroic struggle as if we were some kind of museum piece. Young people say, 'What is that freedom? I'm unemployed and I can't get a job.' And that's a fair question."
These are still burning issues in southern Africa, where the aging guerrillas who were beaten, imprisoned or exiled for demanding the right to vote are still running most governments. Unlike other parts of Africa, where colonial rule ended in in the 1960's, most countries here did not start casting off white rule until 1975, when Mozambique and Angola won independence from Portugal. 
Zimbabwe, then known as Rhodesia, followed in 1980 when the first democratic elections propelled Mr. Mugabe to power. Namibia was next in 1990, then South Africa in 1994.
The governments of South Africa, Namibia and Mozambique are still popular with voters and respected abroad. But Zimbabwe, heralded in the 1980's for building schools and clinics, has become increasingly associated with a contracting economy, corruption and repression.
This week, Mr. Mugabe's face was plastered on billboards here along with the date of his birthday, Feb. 21, just like old times. A special birthday edition of the state newspaper carried more than 45 photographs of him. But, although he reiterated today that he would continue with much-criticized policies of giving land to blacks even if "the white men cry," Mr. Mugabe knows he no longer commands universal respect. His decision not to hold a birthday gala in the capital, Harare, which gave him a hero's welcome in 1980, was a bow to change, for Harare is an opposition stronghold now.
Last year, urban voters here voted for a new, interracial opposition party and ended Mr. Mugabe's overwhelming control of Parliament. And with presidential elections due next year, the authorities have stepped up efforts to silence critics.
Last month, the printing press of Zimbabwe's only independent daily newspaper was bombed after government officials had condemned its coverage. This month, officials expelled two foreign journalists who had been critical of the government and arrested several members of the opposition. The authorities also forced the chief justice of the Supreme Court to resign, saying they could not guarantee his safety from government-backed militants.
The militants have threatened to remove the judges forcibly for ordering black squatters to end their invasions of white-owned farms.
In South Africa and Namibia, where whites still own most fertile land, officials have said they will never tolerate such farm invasions. But the region has still been criticized, especially in the West, for not condemning events in Zimbabwe more forcefully. The countries say they prefer private diplomacy, not public rebukes.
But it is also clear that some officials look askance at the new opposition because these emerging parties have links to supporters of the all-white governments of old.
Zimbabwe's Movement for Democratic Change is bankrolled by white businessmen and farmers -- a tiny minority, which owns more than half of the country's fertile land. South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, includes members of the former apartheid government. Both parties emphatically deny that they have any desire to roll back the clock. 
But for years the apartheid government financed black opposition movements in Mozambique and Angola to thwart the struggle for black empowerment, and that memory makes veterans of the struggle suspicious now.
"These are the avenues used by the former occupiers to frustrate the independence struggle," Alpheus Narused, the secretary for information for the ruling South-West Africa People's Organization, said of the opposition parties in a telephone interview from Windhoek, Namibia. "In our view all those things are aimed at destroying the gains of independence."
Not everyone takes such an ominous view. In South Africa, Mr. Cronin, for instance, sees Zimbabwe's opposition front as a progressive, popular party. Mr. Vavi and others argue that officials here simply want to mask an ugly struggle for power.
Nicholas McNally, a Zimbabwe Supreme Court justice who has resisted pressure to resign, and in the past opposed the all-white government of Ian Smith, expressed sorrow at his country's woes. "I understand the frustration of people who see whites still sitting pretty," he said. "But I'm very sad that this model jewel state that we had is being destroyed."

HEADLINE: Pataki Is Man Behind Curtain, Trying to Keep The Bills Down 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
As sharply higher electric bills have hit New Yorkers over the last year, Gov. George E. Pataki has taken a number of steps behind the scenes to address the problem. But he has largely avoided discussing the issue publicly.
 That has prompted criticism from Democrats, environmentalists and consumer advocates that Mr. Pataki -- the person most responsible for shaping New York's new, deregulated power market -- is missing a chance to prepare New Yorkers for the likelihood that higher prices and a tight electric supply lie ahead, and to make the case to the public for new power plants and energy conservation. 
 In his State of the State address last month, Mr. Pataki made one brief reference to New York's power problems, saying that the federal government should give the states back some market controls they gave up in deregulating their electric industries.
Mr. Pataki says that New York's recent problems are partly deregulation's growing pains and will ease as the market becomes more competitive. In the long run, he insists, deregulation will result in lower energy costs to consumers.
The governor says he has used his bully pulpit, pointing to ads in which he promotes the federal Energy Star program. But those ads, which encourage people to buy energy-efficient appliances, say nothing about conservation generally or high prices, or even suggest there is a problem.
New York's power troubles are already generating a haze of accusations that is remarkably thick, and Democrats want to pin the troubles on the Republican governor, who says he is likely to run for a third term next year. Viewing high rates as a potent issue, Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat who is running for governor, has accused Mr. Pataki of bungling deregulation.
State officials say Mr. Pataki is very much in charge of the state's efforts to head off an electricity crisis, and this month he granted a long interview to The New York Times on the state's power woes.
The state-owned New York Power Authority is hurrying to install 11 small generators in and around New York City before summer. That would raise the city's power supply by 4 percent, take some of the edge off price spikes and lessen the risk, however remote, of blackouts.
The State Public Service Commission, which oversees New York's power industry, voted last month to double its spending, to $150 million a year, on energy conservation measures. It also plans to petition the federal government for more control over wholesale power prices. And several state agencies have accelerated efforts to approve construction of power plants.
"We understand that deregulation is in a transition period right now," Mr. Pataki said. "We don't have the wholesale markets the way they should be, not just in New York, but across the nation, so we have to take steps to make sure the consumer is protected, and we've been doing that."
Each of the state's steps has met with criticism. Some environmental groups have sued to block the Power Authority's generators because they would bypass air quality regulations, and they note that even with the recent increases the state is spending less on conservation than it did when Mr. Pataki took office.
Democrats and consumer advocates say the Pataki administration should have sought wholesale price controls last year, under the Clinton administration, which was inclined to grant them, rather than waiting until the Bush administration, which is not.
Mr. Pataki's handling of the electricity problem is characteristic of his approach to many thorny issues, from transit fare increases to campaign finance reform. He prefers to work behind the scenes until he can emerge with a popular resolution.
Some Democrats, however, accuse Mr. Pataki of avoiding responsibility on the power issue. "The governor wants to pretend this has nothing to do with him," said Assemblyman Paul D. Tonko, a Democrat who is chairman of the Energy Committee. "This whole situation is his creation."
The governor's office counters that Mr. Tonko is a poor judge because he once cited California as an example New York should follow in deregulating electricity.
Ashok Gupta, an economist and energy specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the governor could have won over the public and his critics on the need for new power plants, in part by committing to more conservation. All the plants proposed in the last several years have encountered organized opposition.
"If the administration had only led an effort that brought together business, environmental and community leaders in support of a balanced energy policy," Mr. Gupta said, "we would be in much better shape today."

HEADLINE: Inside Inspiration; 
Get The Picture?

BYLINE:  By William Norwich; William Norwich is the entertaining editor of The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
The last thing I expected when I telephoned Slim Aarons was to end up arrested. 
A mutual friend had given me the photographer's phone number in Bedford, N.Y. 
 "I should have you arrested for invading my privacy!" he growled. 
 "Did you know that New York State has made it against the law to call someone who does not wish to be telephoned? Where've you been?"
Humor is good, I thought. "London. I just got back." 
Aarons sighed. "What do you want with me?" he asked wearily. "I'm against personal publicity. I'm not in the fast lane." 
I tried to recap, without sounding too oily, the recent praise heaped on his work. That his handsome 1974 book, "A Wonderful Time: An Intimate Portrait of the Good Life," has become, in its out-of-print, highly collectible state -- fetching upward of $1,200 a copy -- the reference point du jour for the fashion and design community. That Steven Meisel had surely paid homage to him in his Versace 2000 advertising campaign, with his photographs of leisurely ladies sitting splendidly in their living rooms. That Kinsey Marable, the Manhattan dealer who specializes in hard-to-find style and decorating books, has said that "A Wonderful Time" was one of the two greatest fashion books ever published. (The second, he claims, is Vogue's "Book of Houses, Gardens, People.")
"My book?" he responded. "One of the great fashion books? That's ridiculous."
He added with disdain: "I was a journalist, I was a Life photographer, not a fashion photographer. These are not 'glamour' people in my book. These are not 'style' people. They were just a group of people who had gone through the war. The girls had just come out of boarding school, and the men from the Army. What Tom Brokaw calls 'the greatest generation."' 
I said, "I mean, how the book influences the fashion world nowadays, sir."
"Don't call me sir. That was my father's name."
At least we were talking.
Aarons's "A Wonderful Time" chronicles mostly an American elite, including just a few Hollywood people, as it emerged after World War II, in cities and jet-set watering holes. He documented a time when optimism, not irony, was the driving force of international capitalism.
Aarons shot for Holiday, Town & Country, Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Travel & Leisure and Life. These magazines, especially Town & Country, provided the mother lode for "A Wonderful Time." Because television had not yet made every image except the most shocking seem familiar and repetitious, magazines back then had tremendous energy and offered the sort of intimacy and surprise that you find in Aarons's.
"I believe in fairy tales," 
Aarons wrote in the introduction to his book. "For two decades I have concentrated on photographing attractive people who were doing attractive things in attractive places."
I would later discover that this phrase, "attractive people doing attractive things in attractive places," is Aarons's mantra. 
Maybe "fabulous" is the faster and fleshier superlative now, but "attractive" used to be the chic commendation. Babe Paley made fond use of it. Diana Vreeland did too. "Attractive people doing attractive things in attractive places" is language from a different world. Say it aloud. It connotes something quite different than if you said, "fabulous people doing fabulous things in fabulous places." 
"At some point, Slim fell in love with beauty and had the eyes to see it, whether it was women or places or clothes," said the photographer's friend and former Town & Country colleague Nancy Holmes. "That's why the book is so good, and why he could gather all those people together."
Holmes and Aarons met in Paris in 1949. Having spent the war years shooting for Yank magazine, Aarons was now on assignment in the City of Light, and Holmes was modeling for the couturier Balmain. They were euphoric times. Balmain had gone to Washington, where Holmes lived, to show his first collection after the war. One of the models keeled over with the flu. It was discovered that Holmes fit the clothes. "So Balmain brought me to Paris," Holmes recalled.
She first encountered Aarons one afternoon in the lobby of the Lancaster hotel, where Holmes was having tea with the photographer Robert Capa and the film director Anatole Litvak. As Holmes remembers it, Aarons, the 6 foot 4 inch former soldier from New Hampshire, rushed in "yakking his head off" about a hot, new American model in Paris. "Finally, Capa stood up and pointed his finger at Slim and said: 'Sit down, Slim. You're looking at her.' "
Holmes laughed. "Slim at heart is still a hick from New Hampshire, but he's chic as hell. His dress shirts have a little monogram on them written in Chinese. You know what the monogram says when you translate it? 'No starch, please.' That's Slim."
In the 1960's, when a friend of mine learned from her mother that Aarons was coming to their rarefied town on the North Shore of Long Island to photograph a story for Town & Country, she rushed out and bought a can of white paint. While her Social Registered mother was asleep, she ran to the end of the driveway and painted the two blackamoors white. 
My friend was embarrassed by her family's wealth and politics. She was ambivalent about their pedigree. Her skin would crawl when her mother described something, or someone, as "attractive." As in: "Have you met his people, dear? Are they attractive?" 
The essential world of "A Wonderful Time" was not just jolly and expensive. It was exclusive, if not outright restricted in some communities, against blacks, Jews and gays without long pedigrees or thick closets. But it's not nostalgia for this world of rank and breeding that's made "A Wonderful Time" so popular among fashion people. 
The fashion people who respond to Aarons's "A Wonderful Time" are unlikely to rush out and paint white the faces of the blackamoors that turn up regularly in their favorite antique shops. Or challenge the nostalgic images of Aarons's women, who, 15 to 25 years ago, wandered lost and confused at the threshold of feminism. No, they are more likely to respond by surfing eBay for the Lilly Pulitzer shifts they see in the Palm Beach photographs, or see if they can track down the cool suede jacket that Senator Barry Goldwater is wearing in the chapter on the Southwest. Dizzied by changing trends and the frivolity of consuming, fashion people -- the fans and the practitioners -- hunger for new inspiration, instruction and, mostly, something sacred in shopping.
Aarons decided not to have me arrested and instead agreed to an interview. 
"I'm telling you I don't have any answers," he said. "I was just doing my job."
"Me, too."
Fashion's devotion to Slim Aarons hit its stride about four years ago when word got out that "society girls were back." Park Avenue princesses and sister acts starring siblings with names like Miller, Herrera and Boardman. The pendulum had swung and celebrity worship felt tired. Sort of. 
Of course, society people have always been a subject for photographers. 
"The bigger question became, is this a good thing or a bad thing, are we regressing, or is it just a sign that we are mixing it up?" said Ingrid Sischy, the editor of Interview magazine and a contributing editor to Vanity Fair, where she writes about photography and art.
"Meanwhile, for photographers, the question was how to take this moment and make it stylish and cool. Slim Aarons is the king of that. Otherwise, you should just go around photographing banks, or doormen."
On the appointed morning I got myself to Grand Central Terminal and boarded a train scheduled to arrive just a few minutes before 9 a.m. in Katonah, N.Y. Aarons said he would meet me at the station. How would I know him?
"You'll figure it out," he said.
And just as Nancy Holmes said, Aarons, age 80, was "chic as hell." He wore a red and white cotton scarf around his neck, a red-checked shirt, a Swiss cardigan, denim-style cotton jeans custom made for him nearly 25 years ago by Brioni in Italy and brown loafers made by the shoemaker across the way from the Grand Hotel Quisisana on Capri, where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Lee Radziwill bought their summer sandals. Aarons's automobile, driven by a young woman who assists him with office work in the mornings, was an imported economy number filled with newspapers and grocery store circulars.
"Come on," Aarons said as we drove away from the station. "I'll show you the house and tell you the story. Shouldn't take long. I don't have many pictures around anymore. I used to keep all my pictures in the attic, but Mark Getty has them all now. Getty's picture archive owns everything. Wonderful guy. Grandson of the old man himself. Direct line right down. He came out here to the house about three or four years ago. He was wearing this little windbreaker and I thought he was a guy looking for a landscaping job."
The sale of his archive to Getty, for an undisclosed sum, meant that Aarons could take it easy. "I highly recommend it," he said.
On the way to the house, Aarons extolled the virtues of Bedford, where he has lived since 1953. Near his house there are Vanderbilts and Morgans "and other old families you don't hear about because they don't want you to." Not too far away, a techno-potentate one hears about quite often recently closed on 20 acres of expensive gentleman's farmland. "Got himself lots of manure. Get the picture?" Aarons said, and laughed. 
The car turned up the road that led to his place, a farmhouse built in 1782. "I married a girl from the picture department of Life magazine. When I got married, all the Life photographers chipped in and gave me the money to buy the house." The memory of their generosity is still very sweet to him. 
"I'm a pack rat," he warned as we entered the dining room just to the right of the front door. The sunny room was painted with a wraparound trompe l'oeil mural celebrating the country life of the Aarons family and their favorite neighbors. The photographer's wife, Rita, was not at home today. Their daughter, Mary, works for Horticulture magazine in Boston. 
Off the dining room was a small greenhouse where the photographer likes to sit on winter afternoons and answer his mail. Bougainvillea grew there with considerable success. A long bench in the front hall held piles of magazines, including old numbers of Life, and on the wall you rather quickly notice a Picasso drawing showing Rita pregnant with Mary in 1958 and a thank-you note for a photo Aarons took of the painter. You also notice the framed note from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis thanking Aarons for helping her with one of her projects. 
We headed into the living room lined with bookcases and trompe l'oeil cabinets that hide the television and the bar. All houses in Bedford have bars, but Aarons said he doesn't drink. "If you can get through a war without drinking, you don't need it. I smoked, photographer's habit."
A video of Madonna's "Truth or Dare" was on top of one pile. "No, I stayed in my own pew," he answered when asked if he ever had ambitions to make documentaries. The apartment he kept across from the Ritz Tower on Park Avenue many years ago -- "a walk-up, full-floor, $32-a-month, get the picture?"- did, however, prompt Alfred Hitchcock to change Jimmy Stewart's character in "Rear Window" from a writer to a photographer. Aarons did some scouting photography for the movie.
I said how much I liked his house. Would he ever have it photographed for a magazine?
"You nuts?" he answered.
Aarons sat down. "Sit," the photographer ordered. "You must be tired of looking up my nostrils."
He opened a Manila folder filled with papers. "Here's why I don't shoot anymore." He passed me a 1999 cover of San Francisco magazine showing Robin Williams, his back to the camera, urinating into a body of water. "That's considered witty," he said. 
The next picture he handed to me was a photograph Steven Meisel took of Madonna for a Versace campaign that was torn from the pages of The New York Times Magazine. Madonna was wearing an evening dress, one foot perched on a chair. "I think Meisel is great, to tell you the truth," Aarons said, "but I didn't like this picture. 
What is she doing? Her shoe is on a good piece of furniture!"
If Meisel's advertising work, also including his recent Valentino campaign, was inspired by "A Wonderful Time," Aarons said he was "flattered." He added, "Listen, I've been ripped off for years." He looked for something in his file. "I even ripped myself off. I did some of the first ads for Ralph Lauren in the 1970's and Ralph, who is a neighbor, by the way, told me to 'rip myself off,' and shoot the model like the polo shot of Laddie Sanford in the Palm Beach chapter in the book."
Upset once when an ad campaign by Barneys New York felt too reminiscent of his work, Aarons telephoned the store. "Went right to the top man," he said. "Always do. Got Mr. Pressman on the phone. Said, 'You're copying me.' He said: 'Oh, Slim Aarons? We have three copies of your book and we rip you off every day.' "
Aarons laughed. "At least he was honest."
Aarons is confounded by magazines today. "There's no place I want to put my work," he said. 
"I don't want to shoot a story for a magazine with cover lines like, 'How to Have Multiple Orgasms While You're Camping With Him."' 
The trouble with magazines today, Aarons said, "is the women in the business." He added: "There aren't any Carmel Snows or Diana Vreelands anymore.* At least men had mothers. Get the picture? Women think like Dad. They think like a bunch of men in saloons, the lowest common denominator."
Aarons told me he recently received a phone call from someone writing a piece on Babe Paley. The writer asked the photographer if he ever had eaten with Paley. "Yes, I can manage a fork and a spoon," he responded. "You see, I was one with everybody I photographed. We were basically the same age. I never wore a black T-shirt. I dressed appropriately. I never arrived with a crew of people. I used natural lighting. If it was good enough for Rembrandt, it was good enough for me. Young photographers always ask me how to make it. I say, 'Go to the museums and look.' But I'm not interested in young photographers, although I like Bruce Weber a lot. Good guy. Have a few letters from him. And another thing: I never had a stylist or hair and makeup people. You going to tell Babe Paley what to wear or how to make up?"
Aarons employed only one assistant. "A beautiful girl, always a racehorse from a good family, prettier than anyone you were going to photograph," he said. "Someone who refuses you will change his mind when he sees a beautiful girl. 'Come in, come in, have a drink,' he'd say. 'Mind if I look around?' I'd ask. While everyone was looking at the beautiful girl, I could look around and make decisions about how I was going to do the job." 
When he was 18, Aarons enlisted in the Army. He left New Hampshire "to make my way in the world" and arrived at Governor's Island. He was interested in photography, and volunteered to help in the photo lab. "Know how to dip hypo?" the head of the lab asked.
Aarons learned. War was imminent, and the man running the lab was made a major. Aarons replaced him. Soon he was shooting the cadets' official photographs. "And if a guy committed suicide, I took that picture, too," he remembered, putting the photograph of Madonna back in the Manila folder.
"Frank Capra came through looking for people to help on a magazine called Yank, which was like the Stars and Stripes, and I was off for Africa on the Pan Am Clipper with an attachment to the Eighth Army Division." Slim Aarons received the Purple Heart when he left the Army. "I gave it to a girlfriend of mine at the time. It's all bull, you see."
He rested in New Hampshire for a while and then drove across country to Hollywood with his friend Bill Mauldin, the cartoonist. The war had been hard. "I was really beat by the time I got back to the States," he said. Aarons felt he had paid his dues and decided it was all right to turn his camera away from misery. He chased beauty now. "Attractive people in attractive places doing attractive things," he repeated. 
In Hollywood, through his Yank connections, he started shooting for Life while some friends tried to turn him into a movie star. He appeared in a total of four films. "They wanted to make a cowboy out of me." His only line in the movie "Up Front With Mauldin" was, "Put the chicken in the stew, Willy." 
"That's what they're laughing about in my picture 'Kings of Hollywood,' Louis Auchincloss's favorite photograph of mine," he said. "I'm at Mike Romanoff's joint and Gary Cooper is telling Clark Gable, Van Heflin and Jimmy Stewart how I flubbed my one and only line." He looked away and remembered more. 
Aarons met Jean Howard in Hollywood. The former Ziegfeld showgirl, MGM contract player and Hollywood wife was turning pro as a photographer. Her husband at the time, the legendary agent and producer Charles Feldman, asked Aarons to help her out. Howard ended up going with Aarons to Rome, where Life was opening a new bureau. Although her book, "Jean Howard's Hollywood," does not talk about their relationship, in her second book, "Travels With Cole Porter," she published a letter from Porter that included the remembrance, "Love to Slim." 
"I helped Jean with her flash," Aarons said slowly. 
His beat in Rome was "the pope, movie stars and gangsters." "I shot Lucky Luciano for Life because he owed me a favor and gangsters always pay back," he said. "Remember, I'm not a moralist," Aarons added, and smiled. "When he was in jail he didn't like anyone to call him Lucky because he didn't think it was lucky. So everybody called him Charlie."
Aarons's Christian name is George.
Leland Hayward admired Aarons's Life photographs from Italy and asked him to come back and shoot his theater productions in New York. "Leland Hayward was my role model, a wonderful guy," Aarons said. "I shot Broadway productions for Hayward, Joshua Logan and Mrs. Selznick."
Aarons got up and walked to the kitchen. "I designed the kitchen," he said proudly. He owns a red dishwasher. "Why not? Whimsy is good." He opened a cupboard drawer and out popped an ironing board on a spring. "Everything in life should have form and design," he said. But Aarons doesn't own a computer. "Everyone is trying to get online," he said. "I'm trying to get offline."
We ate tuna fish sandwiches on white bread and drank Canada Dry ginger ale, Aarons's favorite drink. Next to the kitchen table was the photographer's "spike" -- "Like the name?" -- a piece of metal on which he pins notes and invitations, a dinner with Graydon Carter at Diane Von Furstenberg's in TriBeCa and a reminder that he was to dine with Fleur Cowles and Dominick Dunne in town. 
Lunch was over. Slim Aarons had no intention of keeping me from catching the next train. 
Before we left for the station, he opened a Kodak box with prints that were shown recently in a retrospective at the Overseas Press Club of America in New York. He rested a photograph of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on the kitchen counter. It was the one where she is in her early 20's and she is wearing pearls and elbow-length white gloves and there is a scarlet wrap in her lap and she is looking up into the world and smiling like she had just seen a beautiful horse.
"In so many of her photographs Jackie looks hard," Aarons said. "Not here. Like any good photograph, it's all in the eyes. 
You see a young girl who sees a friend and she likes him and it tells you the whole story about how this young girl thinks when she's happy."
I slid into the passenger seat, and Aarons backed the car out of the narrow two-car garage. I couldn't have done it.
"Thank you for today," I said. 
"I had a wonderful time."
"Yeah, yeah," Aarons responded. "Do you know who de Beistegui was?" 
I did. Carlos de Beistegui was a noted host and arbiter who gave marvelous costume balls in places like Venice or at his house, the Chateau de Groussay, near Paris. Particularly famous was the ball de Beistegui gave in Venice in 1951 that convened international society after World War II.
"I think about de Beistegui sometimes," Aarons said as he drove. "I do a thing, and everyone mocks it. But if you don't have the people like the ones I photographed, then your capitalism is shot." 
He then explained how the communist papers in Europe wrote tirelessly about de Beistegui's extravagances. "So de Beistegui finally stopped giving his dances," Aarons said. "Then guess what the newspapers wrote? 
They wrote how terrible it was that de Beistegui and all his rich friends were putting poor people out of work by not having their extravagant parties."
He laughed. "You can't win," Slim Aarons said, "because it's all bull."

 The Imagined Civil War
Popular Literature of the North and South,
1861-1865.
By Alice Fahs.
Illustrated. 410 pp. Chapel Hill:
The University of North Carolina Press. $39.95.
"Is this tremendous epic we are now living to bring forth naught but trash unutterable and bombast?" asked the editor of The Round Table, a New York periodical, in 1864. It was a good question, and one that has, by and large, stood the test of time. The great mass of poetry and fiction produced in both the North and the South during the Civil War has found virtually no place in the history of the era because most scholars have agreed with that observer of 1864. Indeed, Daniel Aaron entitled his influential study of American writers during these years "The Unwritten War," and Edmund Wilson opened his "Patriotic Gore" with the comment that "The period of the American Civil War was not one in which belles-lettres flourished."
But there was another literature -- that "trash" and "bombast" -- that Alice Fahs believes merits our attention. The incredible outpouring of war poetry, sentimental stories, sensational novels, humor, juvenile fiction and war histories that gushed forth between 1861 and 1865 has its own tale to tell, she insists, and by the end of her fascinating book "The Imagined Civil War," we are inclined to agree with her.
Fahs, who teaches history at the University of California, Irvine, opens by looking at the war poetry that filled column after column of both Northern and Southern newspapers and magazines. The initial poetic concentration on the flag, spread-eagle patriotism and the virile manhood of the troops soon gave way to a much more personal focus. The individual experience of war, soldier by soldier, mother by mother, became the dominant theme of both poetry and popular fiction as the civilian population struggled to make sense of the massive bloodletting. The "sentimental soldier," imagining his home and family at the moment of death, or suffering in stoic silence on his hospital bed, provided "an icon of heroism" that linked the experience of combat with the lives of those behind the lines. "A much repeated trope in the North during the war," Fahs writes, "was the idea that every bullet killed or wounded twice, once on the battlefield and once on the home front."
The war also became increasingly "feminized" in the popular literature of both regions, albeit with significant differences. In the North, a "moral economy" emerged that placed the suffering of women on the same plane as that of their soldier husbands, sons, fathers and brothers. In many ways, "women's wounds" became "the emotional center of the nation," Fahs writes -- dramatic vindication of the role Northern women were playing in sustaining the struggle. South of the Potomac, however, the prewar cult of domesticity reigned. Women were expected to sacrifice all for the sake of their new nation, to stand steadfast and unquestioning in the face of terrible loss -- and to do so within the confines of their own homes. Outside work, even nursing, received scant mention and little praise from Southern writers during the war.
Not surprisingly, regional differences emerged most clearly on matters of race. Certainly one of the major strengths of this fine book is Fah's insightful discussion of the changing image of black people in Northern popular literature. Racist stereotypes persisted in the North throughout the war years, but significant new themes emerged. In the summer and fall of 1862, for example, Northern popular writers began to argue that blacks deserved a chance to fight for their freedom. The point might be made with incredible crudeness and insensitivity -- one poem was entitled "Sambo's Right to Be Kilt" -- or it might focus on a man like Robert Smalls, a South Carolinian who, with his crew of fellow slaves, commandeered a Confederate vessel in June 1862 and sailed into Union-controlled waters. But the case for black enlistment emerged just as Abraham Lincoln was making his first moves in the direction of Emancipation, and the argument grew stronger in the summer of 1863. In July of that year, the 54th Massachusetts, the most famous black regiment in the Union Army, stormed Fort Wagner near Charleston, S.C. The 54th established black courage and black manhood in unmistakable terms in Unionist popular literature, but Northern writers ultimately could not come to grips with the full implications of black military service. Almost invariably, Fahs points out, tales of black heroism in battle ended with the death of the hero -- a trajectory that celebrated black bravery without having to imagine the full participation of black veterans in American life. The cultural landscape of the North was already being prepared for the postwar denial of black claims to full citizenship.
Southern writers presented a much different picture of the Negro, of course. In their view, the once happy slave, kidnapped by the vile Yankees and forced into the ranks, only wanted to get back to his former home so that he could "belong to somebody," a return to the Negro's supposed natural state. Poems like "The Contraband's Return" insisted, as paradoxical as it may seem to our ears, that "only slavery allowed true freedom" to black people -- a persistent theme of Lost Cause fiction well into the 20th century. Accompanying this picture of slave loyalty, confusion and docility was a much less benign portrait of the black as a man-child easily corrupted by "Yankee abolitionists" and turned loose on the "fair, unprotected females" of the South. As Fahs notes, "even in the crucible of war, an immutable and intertwined Southern racial and sexual order survived unscathed." Here was a literary tradition that postwar Southern writers like Thomas Dixon Jr. could embrace with unalloyed enthusiasm and popularize across the nation in novels like "The Clansman" and movies like "Birth of a Nation."
Fahs has worked her way through an extraordinary amount of popular poetry and fiction in her effort to illuminate the cultural landscape of these years. Her light shines brightest on the North, it must be said, but this concentration seems unavoidable. Only in one genre -- poetry -- did the volume of Southern literary production come close to rivaling the North, and this was only because newspapers were the principal outlet for Confederate verse. The South did not have the publishing houses, the printing presses or even adequate amounts of paper to sustain a vigorous commercial literary culture. But Fahs has still managed to give us new and valuable insights into the wartime South, and her treatment of Northern popular literature is a signal contribution to our understanding of Civil War America.

HEADLINE: The Close Reader; 
The Romance of Real Estate

BYLINE:  By Judith Shulevitz <BLB>Good real estate novelists drive us out to parts of town we've never seen before. 

 BODY:
Certain subjects change the way we read fiction. Sex is one, which is why some authors are reluctant to write about it directly. Real estate is another, at least for anyone who has ever ridden the heart-stopping roller coaster of the contemporary housing market. The allure of both comes dangerously close to that of pornography or of books about people you know: your prurient interest in the subject matter threatens to overwhelm your attention to anything else.
 I'm not the first to observe that sex and real estate arouse feelings of similar intensity. In a recent book titled "Sex and Real Estate: Why We Love Houses," Marjorie Garber, a Harvard English professor, makes the same point. Garber seems more intent, though, on showing that domesticity is often described in the language of physical passion than in explaining how such desires are put to literary use. On one level, it's simple. Good real estate novelists do what good real estate agents do. They drive us out to parts of town we've never seen before and offer us alternate ways of being in the world. 
 That's what all fiction does, of course, but the appeal of real estate fiction is that it does so in a particular way -- by letting us in on the sometimes sordid secrets of the trade. Countless works of Western literature, from Exodus and the "Odyssey" down to "Paradise Lost" and the entire oeuvre of Marcel Proust, have involved the search for a home, a thing of incomparable value. A real estate novelist can pull out the comparables and tell you its price within minutes. He or she even has data on how long characters should spend looking for it. According to Frank Bascombe, the agent in Richard Ford's "Independence Day," statistics show that it is best to stop after 45 houses: "Clients, after this point, frequently don't buy a house but shove off to other locales." 
It is the relentless commodification of landscapes, exterior and interior, that gives "Babbitt" its comic tone. Sinclair Lewis's 1922 novel about a real estate agent and developer -- call it the founding text of the genre, at least in American literature -- is filled with deadpan inventories of the objects in George F. Babbitt's world, all of which are described in the jarring adspeak of the day. His office building downtown is "as fireproof as a rock and as efficient as a typewriter." His Dutch Colonial house in the suburb of Floral Heights has, to Babbitt's pride, the same appointments and amenities as every other house in Floral Heights, "the best of taste, the best of inexpensive rugs, a simple and laudable architecture and the latest conveniences." 
There's just one thing wrong with the Babbitt house, Lewis says: "It was not a home." This is a perfect summary of Babbitt's spiritual condition. He is ethically, emotionally, at one point almost physically homeless, largely because he can't see through his commercial appraisals of people and things to their true value. He falters and flounders, a victim of his own con man's boosterism. (Babbitt is not a crook, exactly, but he specializes in the surreptitious purchase of land that he flips for an enormous profit.) Though he's Presbyterian, Lewis's Realtor -- a word that by a fluke of trademark law must be suggestively capitalized -- bears a certain resemblance to the type of social-climbing Jew (like Balzac's Baron de Nucingen or Wharton's Rosedale) whose speculations distorted the moral economies of so many 19th- and early 20th-century novels. 
By 1995, when "Independence Day" was published, real estate had clearly lost much of its stigma. The novel is the most thorough examination of the industry I know, and its hero, Frank Bascombe, an agent in the smallish town of Haddam, N.J., is nothing if not an honest broker. He exhibits a high degree of social consciousness -- he buys houses in a black neighborhood in hopes of preserving it -- and a local historian's sense of place. He has a straight-shooting sales technique. He never pushes or exaggerates. He is blunt about the compromises and trade-offs his buyers may have to make. His efforts to sell a house to a couple with unreasonable expectations is a masterly exercise in what Saul Bellow calls reality instruction. 
And yet Bascombe seems as badly anchored as Babbitt. This is partly a function of his rootless times, but there's more to it than that. It's as if Bascombe's psychologically subtle salesmanship had come at the cost of a deeper intimacy. Like the therapist who can't solve his own problems, Bascombe is brilliant at helping his clients figure out where and how to live but can't feel his way into viable relationships with his ex-wife, girlfriend and troubled son. It is not a coincidence that half the action in the novel takes place on the Interstate, from which Bascombe calls in frequently for messages. 
Why is the Realtor such a troubled figure? Perhaps, in part, because he or she has become a stand-in for the author, who uses the real estate profession to raise questions about the literary one. In Ford's case the comparison is explicit: Bascombe used to write fiction. In "Off Keck Road," Mona Simpson's new contribution to the genre, the analogy is implied. Showing a house is like telling a story because both involve sleight of hand and little acts of betrayal. 
Bea Maxwell, one of Simpson's two heroines, is a smart, handsome woman who leaves her job as a copywriter in Chicago in the 1950's to care for her ailing mother in Green Bay, Wis. For lack of anything better to do, Bea becomes a real estate agent, which allows Simpson to give her readers an overview of Green Bay, its old-money downtown, its dirt-poor outlying areas, and their decay or development over the years, facilitated by local agents like Bea. Bea herself winds up in her mother's once glamorous house, unable to maintain it and utterly alone. Her only enduring relationship is a platonic friendship with the boss of her agency.
Bea does have a gift, though, for something that resembles domesticity. The technical term for her art is "staging" -- cleaning and fluffing a house for show -- but she so excels at it that her colleagues coin the verb "to One-Hour Maxwellize" (on the model of "One-Hour Martinizing"). So how could this competent professional get trapped inside a slowly moldering house? The novelist hints at an answer, a note of self-accusation, even self-pity, audible in her voice. There is something soul-destroying about the manufacture of illusions, she seems to suggest, particularly when they are made of material as dear to us as a home. Or, to put it in Simpson's words: "Every so often, Bea wanted to One-Hour Maxwellize her house. She too wanted that clean, chemical, mint quality. But maybe, she thought, houses were ruined for her. She knew too much about the stagecraft of improvement. Perhaps selling anything eventually spoils it for you."

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER; 
A Night's Stay For $80 or Less

BYLINE:  By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
ALONG America's roads today, drivers seeking modestly priced places to stay can encounter a bewildering variety of chains. There are 120 different chain names in the economy and midscale categories, as ranked by Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn., which monitors the hospitality industry. The two categories combined have average rates under $80 a night.
 The total of such lodgings is really far larger, in fact; Smith has a separate category for 48 midscale chains with restaurants attached that also have daily rates under $80 a night, and it encompasses some biggies: Clarion, Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Select, Howard Johnson's, Ramada and Quality Inn. 
 The trade magazine Hotel & Motel Management published a chart this month that showed there were 14,500 properties bearing the names of the 55 biggest chains in the two Smith categories, economy and midscale without restaurants. As has been true for several years, Days Inn was at the top of the list; its sun-up signs have been hung out by franchise-holders at 1,800 United States properties with 152,000 rooms. That is about as far as you can get from a boutique hotel. 
The next four on the list were Comfort Inn and Suites, Super 8, Hampton Inn and Suites, and Motel 6. At the opposite end is Cambridge Suites, a brand name used by the Candlewood Hotel Company of Wichita, Kan., for a chain of one, as of December -- a 64-room property in Wichita.
In this vast marketplace, what separates one brand from another? Most limited-service places, for example, provide free Continental breakfast, but others depend on adjacent fast-food places, and this is worth asking about. Also, when a motel company has taken over many properties with other affiliations, the bedroom design cannot be consistent, although there may be a minimum size.
Here is a scorecard of what a few of the bigger chains offer.

Giant Franchiser
The giant, Days Inns of America Inc., a division of the Cendant Corporation in Parsippany, N.J., owns none of the places bearing its name. Like all other franchisers, it grants rights to its name and reservation service to owners who apply, qualify and pay the required fees. Among the requirements are bedrooms of 288 square feet, about average for motels.
In the 1990's, according to Joseph R. Kane Jr., the company president, the name expanded widely through "conversions" -- transfers by owners from other affiliations. One result is a variety of building designs that meet the bedroom size minimum. Many of the inns are older motels; Mr. Kane said 60 percent have exterior corridors. The safety of this design is disputed in the industry, and as a result, few new motels are built this way.
Last year, the average paid for a night at a Days Inn was $55, which included a Continental breakfast at 80 to 85 percent of the properties. A free breakfast is a requirement for new franchises. Half the chain's guests were business travelers. Mr. Kane said that suites were being built into the new places to encourage travelers who were willing to spend more. In the last five years, he said, the company has dropped 400 motels whose owners were allowing the properties to "languish."
Comfort Inn, No. 2 on the list, is part of Choice Hotels, a franchiser with seven brand names: Comfort Inn and Comfort Suites, Sleep Inn, MainStay Suites, Quality, Clarion, Econo Lodge and Rodeway Inn. The Comfort name appears on more than 1,400 United States properties with 115,300 rooms. The minimum size for a Comfort Inn room is 288 square feet and for a suite room, 396 square feet.
Steven Schultz, Choice's executive vice president for domestic hotels, said that under a recent reorganization, a lot of "reimaging" was planned, with new signs for some brands and other cosmetic shifts. Sixty percent of Comfort's guests, he said, are business travelers. The average rate for both Comfort categories combined, he said, was in the low 60's, but Comfort Suites, all newly built, commanded $10 to $12 more a night. Free Continental breakfast is provided at both. Comfort labels appear on new and converted properties; 80 to 85 percent have interior corridors, a spokeswoman said.
Sleep Inn, another Choice brand, ranked No. 13 with 280 properties. Sleep Inns have all been built to the company's plans in the last 10 years or so, with interior corridors. Rooms have 256 square feet. These motels, with an average rate last year in the high 50's, provide free Continental breakfast.
Mr. Schultz said that for all brands, Choice dropped franchises for 170 operators last year and 200 in 1999.

'Clean and Reasonable'
Super 8, No. 3 in size, another Cendant brand, says it has 1,965 motels. Its average daily rate for 1999 -- Super 8 does not release the previous year's figures until March -- was $44.55. "We focus on offering a clean room with friendly service at a reasonable price," Evy Apostolatos, a spokeswoman, said. She said that 80 to 90 percent of Super 8's provided Continental breakfasts; after April 1, all will be required to do it. The minimum room size is 240 square feet. Two-thirds of guests are men averaging 45 years old with a $50,000 income -- probably travelers in sales, or entrepreneurs. Senior citizens represent a quarter of the market. Motels with exterior corridors constitute 15 to 20 percent of the properties, mainly in the Southeast and California, Ms. Apostolatos said.
Another motel chain with properties built to order is Hampton Inn and Suites, a division of Hilton Hotels. It ranks fourth on the list; the Hampton name, which appeared in 1985, is used by 1,080 places that are either franchised or owned by the company. Judy Christa-Cathey, vice president for the Hampton brand, said that last year's average daily rate was $73 for inns, in the low 90's for suites. The average inn room is 324 square feet; the average two-room suite is 470. She said that 10 percent of Hampton's inns were built with exterior corridors and that 51 percent of its guests were vacationers. "The majority of our business travelers are men," she said, "and they rely on our consistency." Hampton was an early starter with free Continental breakfast, and all its inns offer it.
Last year, Ms. Christa-Cathey said, eight motels were dropped for failure to meet standards, and she said the company monitored a rather large list of places that had been warned about performance. 
Microtel Inns and Suites is a franchise brand with 213 domestic motels, all built to the company's specifications with interior corridors. The average daily rate last year was $46. "It's the same hotel wherever you go," said Microtel's president, Michael A. Leven. "Sameness is very important at the lower end of the price scale." He called the chain "the Volkswagen" of the business, with virtually no amenities. For example, there is no shampoo in Microtel rooms, he said, although the front desk stocks it along with other items that guests might have forgotten. The small Continental breakfast is designed for those who "grab and go." The rooms can also be small: the one designated as a "single" is 192 square feet; the "queen" 288 square feet, and the single-room "suite" -- it has a bed and a sleeper sofa, with a kitchenette on an island between the two -- 372 square feet.
Microtel provides HBO free.
Ninety-five percent of Country Inns and Suites, a division of Carlson Hospitality Worldwide, which owns hotels, a cruise line, restaurants and other travel businesses, is newly built, according to its president, Paul Kirwin. It gets 60 percent business travelers at its 246 properties. Mr. Kirwin said Country Inns' units were designed "to feel like a B & B," with a homey feel, although the motels provide computer hookups, exercise rooms and other amenities not common at bed-and-breakfasts.
Country Inns are popular with "early seniors and empty-nesters," Mr. Kirwin said. The average room is 312 square feet; a suite room is 384 square feet, and a free Continental breakfast is provided. The average daily rate last year was $70, and Mr. Kirwin said the inns got many middle-management people, technicians and other business travelers, as well as upper-middle-income vacationers. The properties are 99 percent interior-corridor design, he said.
Motel 6's average daily rate last year was in the high 30's and low 40's. Eric Studer, senior vice president for marketing, said studies of national chains had found Motel 6 to be the lowest-priced, and "price is our focus." Few, if any, Motel 6's provide Continental breakfast; "we don't encourage it," a spokeswoman said. A room with one bed averages 212 square feet; a room with two, 276 square feet. Mr. Studer said that the chain, owned by the French Accor group, had 816 properties in the United States, of which 109 were franchised. He said the chain was growing "methodically" and turned away 1,300 applicants last year because they were not willing to invest in renovations.
The Smith category omits Howard Johnson's but might just as well include it because it straddles the restaurant-no restaurant border. Of the 420 Howard Johnson's in the United States, 200 are now Howard Johnson Express Inns, which have no restaurants but provide free Continental breakfast. Mary Mahoney, president of Howard Johnson's, said this tier was begun in 1997 because the chain, another part of Cendant, found applicants for franchises did not want to operate restaurants and the chain wanted to continue to grow. The target market is still families with children. Two-thirds of Howard Johnson's properties have exterior corridors. The minimum room size is 245 square feet. Andrew Miller, a spokesman for the chain, would not supply an average daily rate, citing the wide disparity of the chain's markets.

Inside or Outside Corridors
The dispute over the safety of exterior corridors is complex. Ms. Mahoney said that women who traveled did not mind exterior corridors provided the parking lot was well lighted. Mr. Kirwin of Country Inns said women would not stay at places with exterior corridors and his company therefore no longer accepted them.
Anthony Marshall, president of the Educational Institute of the American Hotel and Motel Association, recently wrote in the group's magazine that he felt uneasy after dark going into a motel with room entrances on the outside. But Greg Plank, president of Suburban Lodges, which ranked 12th on the association's list, said his company might continue to build outside-corridor lodgings because they were popular.
A number of executives interviewed for this article said that salespeople liked to back their cars up to their rooms and keep an eye on the contents. Yet no executives interviewed said they were building motels with exterior corridors, so where these are found, they are likely to be older.
"The hotel business is very location-oriented, and the fact is that exterior-corridor properties are in prime locations throughout the country," Mr. Plank noted. "They got there first, and providing they maintain their quality, they will continue to thrive regardless of their flag affiliation."
Travelers who are picking their motels by brand name because they do not welcome surprises may therefore want to add a new question about exterior corridors to the ones they usually ask.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN; 
Natchez

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER MOSES; JENNIFER MOSES, the author of "Food and Whine" (Fireside), lives in Baton Rouge.

 BODY:
Mainly what I love about Natchez is its fairy-tale quality of having been suspended in time. And the fact that it's small enough to explore on foot, which gives you a chance, if you're nosy, to peer behind picket fences into private gardens, gaze through antique-glass windows into living rooms, and daydream about a slower, prettier and perhaps more romantic era.
 Yes, there is the occasional sport-utility vehicle, the odd blast of rap music from an open window, and universal air-conditioning -- not to mention an outer ring of strip malls and fast-food outlets. But Natchez, largely because its economy never recovered from the devastating boll weevil infestation of 1908, was nearly overlooked by the developers who changed the landscape of the South. 
 More to the point, its citizens didn't have the cash to install modern kitchens, affix two-car garages, or upgrade in any way. So, to this day, visitors to one of the oldest settlements on the Mississippi can see it much as it was during its heyday before the Civil War (or the War Between the States as it's still called here) when -- thanks to King Cotton -- Natchez was home to over half the millionaires in the United States. It goes without saying that their vast fortunes were wrenched from the most hideous injustice, and yet the palatial homes -- in a range of styles from Federal to Southern Planter, handsome churches and imposing public buildings that cotton made possible are glorious to behold.
More than 500 of these magnificent structures still stand, their architectural integrity intact, because Natchez was miraculously nearly unscathed in the Civil War. And some 30 of them -- many privately owned -- are on display twice a year during the Spring and Fall Pilgrimages. 
You want the Old South? Dressed in period costume, guides are sure to give visitors plenty of "y'alls" as well as history; mint juleps, an art form in Natchez, are sure to flow; and the gardens will be bursting with azaleas, sweet olive, camellias, tulip poppies, jasmine and dogwood.

Events
This year's Spring Pilgrimage will be March 7 through April 7 (the Fall Pilgrimage will be Oct. 10 to 27). Each tour this spring stops at four houses, and costs $24 a person, half that for ages 6 to 17. There are morning and afternoon tours, eight in all. Morning-tour houses are open 9 to 1, afternoon houses 1:30 to 5:30. Some of the houses are open year-round, but not the ones that are privately owned. A bus runs to three of the four houses on each tour for $26 from any hotel in town.
Pilgrimage information is available from Natchez Pilgrimage Tours, (800) 647-6742, or at www .natchezpilgrimage.com. 
Besides the houses themselves, the Pilgrimage season includes three evening entertainments. The most famous of these is the Historic Natchez Pageant (formerly the Confederate Pageant), during which local performers, again dressed in period costume, dance and sing in a show worthy of "Gone With the Wind." Performances are at the Natchez City Auditorium, 207 Jefferson Street (at Canal), at 8:30 p.m. on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday; tickets are $12. 
Gospel and comedy are featured in the other two shows during Pilgrimage season. The Holy Family Gospel Choir will perform a musical tribute to the African-American struggle, "Southern Road to Freedom." It is presented Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday nights at 8:30 at the First Presbyterian Church, 117 South Pearl Street. Tickets: $10.
"Southern Exposure," a satire about the Pilgrimage, will be presented at the Natchez Little Theater Playhouse Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday nights at 8:30. Tickets: $12. Reservations for all three shows can be made through Natchez Pilgrimage Tours, (800) 647-6742.
On April 20 to 22, the Natchez Bluff Blues Fest, will bring bands from all over the South to Memorial Park, next to St. Mary Minor Basilica, and 13 clubs and restaurants around town. There will be plenty of red beans, rice and other regional foods, too. General admission, $7 at the park, most other shows free; information: (601) 442-2988.
The Natchez Opera Festival, including performances of "H.M.S. Pinafore," "Carmen" and "La Boheme," is held throughout May. Concerts and recitals are in the New Covenant Presbyterian Church, St. Mary Minor and the Margaret Martin Performing Arts Center. Tickets are $20 to $45. There are also free outdoor concerts, and recitals in historic homes; (800) 647-6724 or www2 .bkbank.com/ncvb. 

Sightseeing
The Grand Village of the Natchez Indians, a prehistoric site that includes three ceremonial mounds, a ceremonial plaza and a visitors center, is at 400 Jefferson Davis Boulevard, southeast of downtown. Open daily, free; call (601) 446-6502.
Now a museum, Jefferson College, some 10 minutes' drive northeast of Natchez on Highway 61 in Washington, was chartered in 1802 as the first educational institution in Mississippi. Jefferson Davis, among other notables, was a student there. A visitor reception area tells the story of the college, and a nature trail winds through the woods and past the college cemetery. Free; (601) 442-2901.
The neo-Classical Temple B'nai Israel, 213 South Commerce Street, opened in 1905, is the oldest functioning synagogue in Mississippi. It has stained-glass windows, an ark of Italian marble, and a historic Henry Pilcher's Sons pipe organ. The basement contains a satellite of the Museum of the Southern Jewish Experience, with photographic exhibit. Donations are welcome. Information: (601) 362-6357. 
A permanent exhibit, "Natchez in Historic Photographs," is on display at the First Presbyterian Church, 117 South Pearl, (the lovely wooden church, dating to 1829, with soaring ceilings and wooden pews with doors, is itself worth a trip). Suggested donation, $3; (601) 442-2581.
The walking path that was once Clifton Avenue has magnificent views of the river on the one side and Victorian gems on the other. 
A half-mile north, on Cemetery Road, is the Historic Natchez Cemetery, (601) 445-5051. It includes Jewish Hill, where members of Natchez's once-thriving Jewish community are buried. A quarter-mile farther is the Natchez National Cemetery, established by the Union during the Civil War. Information: (601) 445-4981.

Where to Stay
The Guest House Historic Inn, an antebellum mansion at Pearl and Franklin Streets, (601) 442-1054, fax (601) 442-1374, members.aol .com/gsthous/gsthous.htm, has 17 comfortable rooms with private bath, each decorated individually with reproductions. A two-story veranda wraps around the front and sides, and balconies overlook an inner courtyard. All rooms are $114.94 in the off-season (until the Pilgrimage), then $125, including Continental breakfast. 
Celebrate Victorian excess at the Riverside Bed and Breakfast, 211 Clifton Avenue; (601) 446-5730. Wine-red tones are found throughout the home, which was begun in 1858 and has magnificent views of the Mississippi. There are a suite and two doubles furnished with tester beds and antiques. Rates, $85 to $150, include a full Southern breakfast. 
The 132-room Radisson, in the handsome 1927 Eola Hotel on the corner of Pearl and Main Streets, (601) 445-6000, fax (601) 446-5310, offers standard rooms for $99 during Pilgrimage, $89 in off-season. The hotel's restaurant, Julep's, serves a good Sunday Champagne brunch for under $10. 
Budget: A bluff overlooking the Mississippi is the site of the Ramada Hilltop Inn, 130 John R. Junkin Drive, (800) 256-6311, fax (601) 446-6321. Many of the 162 rooms have views; there is also a swimming pool and restaurant. Doubles are $80. 
Luxury: The queen of luxury inns in Natchez is the seriously lovely Monmouth Plantation, 36 Melrose Avenue, (800) 828-4531, fax (601) 446-7762, www.monmouthplantation .com. The 31 rooms are spread among eight buildings, including the original mansion (1818), on 26 acres with a formal rose garden, duck pond, pebble paths, statuary and moss-draped live oaks. A big Southern breakfast is included in the price of the large, romantic, ornate bedrooms. Rates are $190 to $205 for a double and $365 to $380 for suites; the mint juleps are extra. 
Another lovely old place is the Briars Inn, 31 Irving Lane, (800) 634-1818, fax (601) 445-6037, www .thebriarsinn.com, on 19 acres above the Mississippi. The Briars, built around 1814, was the home where Jefferson Davis married Varina Howell in 1845. The 12 spacious guest rooms and 3 suites are tastefully decorated with antiques, upholstered furniture, framed prints and quilts. Rates, $150 to $245, include a full breakfast, after which guests may want to stroll through the gardens, with magnolias, pecan trees, and thousands of daffodils and azaleas. 

Where to Eat
The talk of the town is the recently opened Castle Restaurant, 84 Homochitto Street, (800) 433-2445, in what was once the carriage house at Dunleith Plantation. The walls are exposed brick, the floors made of fine wide floorboards, the furnishings elegant, the service first rate -- and the breads are out of this world. The food is upscale and quite good, with the pretty, colorful entrees -- like grilled filet mignon on creamed potatoes surrounded by grilled vegetables, and topped by a port wine bordelaise -- framed by big white plates. Dinner for two with wine: about $70. 
Another stylish restaurant is John Martin's, on Silver Street in Natchez-Under-the-Hill; (601) 445-0605, extension 2116. The surroundings are starkly elegant, and simply reading the menu is enticing. Sauteed jumbo crab cakes with Creole mustard lemon hollandaise is just one of more than a dozen appetizers; sauteed shrimp with apple smoked bacon, red onions, roasted garlic, leeks, sun-dried tomato and arugula tossed with penne and extra virgin basil olive oil is one of 15 entrees (not including specials.) Dinner for two with wine: $80. Closed Monday. 
The Pig Out Inn, 116 South Canal Street, (601) 442-8050, is a down-home barbecue joint filled with an aroma so yummy you get hungry even if you aren't. A dinner plate of, for example, barbecued chicken or ribs with baked beans and corn on the cob, costs $10.25. Desserts include pecan and sweet potato pies. Tables have rolls of paper towels for sticky hands. A meal for two with beers will be less than $25. Closed Sunday, except during Pilgrimage. 
Nothing costs more than $8 at lunch at Pearl Street Pasta, 105 South Pearl Street, (601) 442-9284, which serves soups, salads and homemade desserts as well as big bowls of pasta, in a small, pleasant sunlit room. Dinner, with a glass of wine, is about $30.
It's so modest, it's easy to miss the Fare, 109 North Pearl, (601) 442-5299. Those who do are passing up a great breakfast. The Jimmy Carter Special -- eggs, grits, toast, a choice of sausage, ham or bacon, and coffee -- is $5.50. The Fare will also box up a lunch for you -- triple-decker sandwiches, roast beef po'boys, burgers, Reubens and salads. Sandwiches are $5 to $6. Closed Sunday. 
The Downtown Deli, 408 Main Street, (601) 445-7799, is also straightforward, serving po'boys, inventive sandwiches and salads. But it also offers an assortment of sophisticated whole bean coffees, as well as breakfast, in the coffee bar. Sandwiches are $4 to $6; salads are $6.95. Closed Sunday, except during Pilgrimage.

HEADLINE: From Bulgaria to New York, via the Army 

BYLINE:  By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
WHEN Dimitri Kovachev was hired by the New York Life Insurance Company in 1999, one of the first people he met was his new boss, Val Ivanov, the managing partner in the Melville office and a fellow Bulgarian.
 As the two men got to know each other, they swapped stories about their past lives in Bulgaria and their journeys to America, and Mr. Kovachev became fascinated with his boss's rags-to-riches success story. So fascinated, in fact, that Mr. Kovachev, a composer in his spare time, decided to write a libretto about Mr. Ivanov's life and to stage a musical about him. 
 That hourlong musical, "Under Manhattan Skyline," will have its premiere at 4 p.m. today at the Queens Museum of Art in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. The story begins in Bulgaria with the 14-year-old central character modeled on Val, and then follows him from country to country during the 1940's as he and his parents attempt to flee fascism. Finally, they make their way to New York, where the character embarks on a successful business career. 
"I had been working on a play comprised of different made-up success stories, when it hit me: why create a story when there was one right in front of me?" Mr. Kovachev said.
For Mr. Ivanov, the journey to success has been a long one.
Eager to share his memories of a past that bears no resemblance to his life today, he talks about his escape from Bulgaria to Yugoslavia, being wrongly imprisoned in France, getting stuck in a refugee camp while trying to emigrate to America, being recruited to serve in the United States Army and finally, becoming an American citizen.
Mr. Ivanov is now 65, over six feet tall with a full head of white hair. In person, he exudes a charm and charisma that undoubtedly helped him win an unprecedented number of sales awards from New York Life and a record number -- 13 -- of Chairman's Trophies, the highest award New York Life gives. It goes to the mananging partner whose office has the best annual sales performance. 
After more than 30 years with the company, Mr. Ivanov still speaks passionately about his career, as well as about the sprawling waterfront home in Glen Cove he bought six years ago, about his love of travel and golf, and especially about his granddaughter, Sophia Ivanov, who was born last month. 
Mr. Ivanov's second life as an American citizen began when he arrived in New York in 1962, right out of the Army. Most of his Army career, after basic training at Fort Jackson, near Columbia, S.C., was spent in Germany, where he was part of an American effort to recruit foreign soldiers.
"They told me that if I stayed in the Army for five years, I could become an American citizen," Mr. Ivanov recalled. "They took 20 of us, flew us from Italy to Frankfurt, Germany, gave us uniforms, and we were American soldiers. All I really wanted was to get to America."
His Army years served as sort of an apprenticeship. "I learned about the American dream," Mr. Ivanov said. "You can take anything away from me, but I'll be O.K. as long as I have my dreams."
When he finally arrived in New York -- after an extra year in the Army and after being decorated for his recruiting efforts -- Mr. Ivanov was reunited with his parents, who had been granted permission to come to America from Italy in 1958. He moved into their tiny apartment in Greenwich Village. 
Both his parents worked as janitors, his father at the Empire State Building and his mother at the Union Carbide Building. "Between them they made $100 a week, and they loved America," Mr. Ivanov said. 
Initially, Mr. Ivanov, then 28, was at loose ends. He thought about becoming a police officer, but his mother thought the job was too dangerous and persuaded him not to. He finally decided to go back to school.
After being accepted at New York University, Mr. Ivanov drove a taxi and bartended to pay his tuition. He graduated in 1966, majoring in Russian literature and Eastern European affairs.
It was at N.Y.U. that he met a premed student who later become his wife. "I had originally intended to fix her up with my friend," Mr. Ivanov said. "But when he was too shy to call her, I called her myself."
Although she was 10 years younger than he was and lived with strict Cuban parents -- her mother accompanied them on their first date to the movies -- Mr. Ivanov was undaunted, and after several months, he told her, "I'm going to marry you."
As he recalled: "When she asked me how I was planning to support her, I just said, 'Don't worry -- one day I'm going to make a lot of money.' "
In 1967, after earning a master's degree in linguistics from N.Y.U., Mr. Ivanov got a job as a public-school teacher in Manhattan. To make ends meet, he continued bartending and driving a cab; even so, his annual salary came to just $10,000. When his father-in-law heard that New York Life was recruiting agents, Mr. Ivanov, who knew nothing about insurance, was quick to tell him he wasn't interested. 
But driven by curiosity, he decided to go for an interview and was offered a job on the spot. He would be paid only commissions, no salary. 
"That was a problem," Mr. Ivanov said, "but I knew I could do it." There was something about the challenge that inspired him to accept the job, he said. And the rest is history -- almost.
"My only problem was my English," Mr. Ivanov said. "I was self-conscious about my accent and kept taking speech courses to correct it, until one of my teachers asked me what I was doing. When I told her, she said, 'You idiot, people spend money to get accents like yours!' "
Mr. Ivanov soon discovered that she was right -- his accent was a great icebreaker. "When I started making cold calls, people were curious about my accent and always wanted to know where I was from," he said. "From that point, it was easy to make new friends."
Before he knew it, Mr. Ivanov had too many clients and started passing some along to fellow agents in the New York Life office in Queens, where he worked.
"I'd make an appointment," he said, "then call another agent and send him on that appointment, with the understanding that if he closed the deal, I'd get 25 percent. Within six months, I had more money than I had ever seen in my life." 
In 1969, after a year as a New York Life agent, Mr. Ivanov decided to go into management. In a little over a year, he recruited 26 new agents, an unprecedented number for the company, he said. When a New York Life office opened in Carle Place, he relocated to Long Island. 
"I bought a house in Nessequogue, near Stony Brook, that I really couldn't afford," he said. "But I believed I would grow into it. If I worked hard, got along with people, had a positive mental attitude and believed in myself and what I did, I knew I would make it."
And make it he did, continuing to recruit sales agents and outgrowing the company's offices in Smithtown and Syosset. Finally, after winning the coveted Chairman's Trophy for 10 consecutive years, he asked New York Life to build a separate office building. 
"I told them that I wanted my own building, or I'd retire," he said. In January 1997, the New York Life Building opened along the Route 110 corridor in Melville, and today Mr. Ivanov's office employs more than 100 agents.
"They are all my family," he said. "I fight with them, I laugh with them and cry with them."
When New York Life created an honorary title just for Mr. Ivanov, he became ineligible to compete for the Chairman's Trophy, to allow someone else a chance to win.
"But it was such a letdown feeling," he said. "I wanted to be back in the competition." His boss finally agreed, and Mr. Ivanov has won the award every year since. In 2000 he won his 13th gold-plated trophy.
Although Mr. Ivanov and his wife separated five years ago, he maintains a close relationship with his two grown children: his daughter, Tanya, 34, and his son, Val Jr., 32, who now works with him in the Melville office.
A few years ago, Mr. Ivanov became an avid golfer by accident. "I had a boat and thought I was happy," he said. "But then the guy next to me kept asking me to play golf with him. I thought it was so stupid to chase a little ball around, but once I finally tried it, I sold my boat, and now I'll go anywhere in the world to play golf."
Recently, he scaled back his workweek. "Money has never been the goal for me," Mr. Ivanov said. "My goal has always been to be the best. I was thinking about retiring but decided against it because I can come in two days a week and accomplish more than most people do in a week. And besides, for me, this is not really work."

A Diverse Island
This series looks beyond the stereotypes that sometimes taint relations between immigrants and native Long Islanders, examining immigrants' lives and how they are being woven -- or not -- into the social and economic fabric. Previous articles looked at a Filipino video store owner, Indian immigrants' cultural roots, an Irish banker, a Hungarian who owns a construction company, a Trinidadian convenience store manager, an Indian liquor store owner, a Colombian landscaper, a Korean nail salon owner and the Muslim community.

HEADLINE: New York Faces Prospect Of Its Own Energy Troubles 

BYLINE:  The following article is based on reporting by Neela Banerjee, Alex Berenson and Richard Perez-Pena and was written by Mr. Berenson.

 BODY:
For New Yorkers, the electricity crisis in California may seem a continent away.
 It isn't. 
New York's electricity industry has striking similarities to California's. Both have been slow to build new plants and were caught off guard in the last year as demand for electricity jumped. Both depend heavily on natural gas to run their generators, leaving them vulnerable to soaring gas prices. Both states have deregulated their electricity markets, so they no longer control the price of power.
In California, those forces have fed a new kind of power failure: rolling blackouts, huge losses for utilities and businesses hobbled by an unreliable electric supply. 
For New York, the immediate prospects are less dire. Although power supplies may be tight in New York City, blackouts are unlikely this summer, barring a bout of unusually hot weather. The state's six utilities are financially healthy, and New York depends much less than California on out-of-state suppliers.
But the way New York deregulated has left ratepayers in New York City and Westchester even more exposed than Californians to price spikes. Consolidated Edison's rates, which have been high for decades, have risen 40 percent since 1999, largely because of costs for natural gas and oil to fuel power plants. Now the nation's highest, those rates are all but certain to rise further as the weather warms and demand for electricity increases. This summer, monthly bills for the average Con Ed customer could easily hit $120, compared with $95 last summer.
New York's problems are likely to worsen over at least the next three years, industry experts say. A lack of major new plants and transmission lines will put the city at increasing risk of shortages and blackouts as demand rises faster than supply. Rates across the state could surge higher, since California's experience shows that deregulation gives power generators leeway to set prices -- and, critics say, manipulate the wholesale power markets -- when supplies are tight. Last summer, officials say, market manipulation cost New Yorkers at least $100 million.
Those troubles could be costly for the state's economy and officials, who are scrambling to stave off increases and make sure New York City has enough reserve power to handle emergencies like a plant breakdown on a hot day.
"The crunch has come," said Maureen O. Helmer, chairwoman of the state Public Service Commission, which oversees New York's power industry. "The No. 1 priority is keeping the lights on, and we are doing what we have to do to make sure that happens." 
The state-owned New York Power Authority is moving to install 11 small generating plants in or near the city by June, though environmental groups have sued to block construction. Last month, the Public Service Commission doubled spending on electricity conservation efforts. 
For this summer, those measures should protect the city from shortages, said Con Ed's chairman, Eugene R. McGrath.
"We will have the reserve and the capacity that we think we need," Mr. McGrath said, although if the new generators are not running, that reserve will be less than the state requires to reduce the odds of widespread blackouts on hot days. Isolated blackouts, like the one that hit Washington Heights in 1999, are possible, Con Ed officials say, though those are due to failures of local transmission lines during heat waves, and not the system's larger problems.
The state's generating capacity, 35,000 megawatts, should provide a surplus. Peak statewide electricity demand this summer is expected to be about 30,600 megawatts, though a heat wave could push that figure higher. (One megawatt is enough power to light 1,000 homes.)
But Mr. McGrath cautions that the city and state sorely need to encourage the building of new power plants and transmission lines to meet demand and ensure that suppliers do not get even more control over prices. No major plants have been built in New York State since 1994, and none have been built in the city for decades. Since 1998, more than 60 large plants have been proposed, but the state has approved only 2, and both are upstate, far from where new supply is needed most. Transmission bottlenecks mean that most of New York City's supply must be generated close by.
Although government and generating company officials trade blame for the delays, all agree that the state has moved more quickly since last fall, when California's plight began to draw national attention. Still, no major new plants are likely to be approved for construction in or near New York City before late this year, and then they are likely to face opposition from environmentalists and neighbors. New transmission lines would allow the city to import more power, but those encounter even more resistance because they run through many communities. 
In late January, five New York City business and labor groups issued a report warning that 2,000 to 3,000 megawatts of generating capacity -- the equivalent of a large nuclear plant -- must be built in the city before 2005. Con Ed agrees. 
"The state is dealing with the immediate problem," said Kathryn S. Wylde, chief executive of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce. "We need the same kind of urgency applied to our long-range needs."

The Comparisons
Deregulation Differs On Opposite Coasts
The word that echoes most often in California's crisis and New York's jitters is "deregulation." But it means different things in each state, and its effects so far have been quite different from its intent.
Like many other states, New York and California deregulated their electricity industries in the mid-1990's in hopes of lowering prices that were already formidable; New York's rates rose 20 percent between 1990 and 1995, driving away manufacturers.
"Back in the mid-90's, the most important thing was to try to get prices down," said Gov. George E. Pataki, who directed New York's deregulation.
To encourage competition in electricity generation, utilities were required to sell their power plants and instead buy electricity from independent generators in new wholesale markets. Rates for consumers and businesses, which had been set by state regulators, would vary with supply and demand rather than being based on the cost of producing power.
Power generators, the thinking went, would build new plants, and new electricity marketing companies would spring up to give consumers a choice of suppliers and rate plans. The new competitors would have to be more efficient than traditional utilities because they could not count on recovering costs from ratepayers. As the cost of producing power dropped, rates would follow.
But in New York, as in California, theory has not become reality. Because no new plants have been built, the existing generators have little incentive to cut wholesale prices. On the retail level, a few companies have tried to compete, but high wholesale prices and the state's regulations have left them unable to offer meaningful savings. So almost all customers still get power from their old utilities, and most people have no idea that they even have the right to choose.
In other industries, high prices often lead to a drop in demand, lowering prices. But electricity is so vital that consumers and businesses will pay almost any price when supplies are tight.
California caps its consumers' rates, and that is why its utilities, unable to pass on runaway wholesale costs, totter near bankruptcy and are relying on the state to buy power for them. New York, however, allows Con Ed to pass on its costs to ratepayers -- the most crucial difference in the ways the two states deregulated.
As a result, Californians' rates stayed flat last year, even as prices in the state's wholesale power market quadrupled. Rates there average about 11 cents per kilowatt-hour -- half as much as Con Ed's rates last month. (One kilowatt-hour is enough to run a large room air-conditioner for an hour.)
New York's other utilities signed contracts to buy power at fixed prices when they sold their plants in the last three years, so they and their customers are largely protected from spikes in wholesale prices. But the contracts signed by Niagara Mohawk Power, the largest upstate utility, will begin to expire in September, and the company has already asked the state for permission to pass rising costs on to consumers. Otherwise, the company warns, it could face the same squeeze as California's utilities.
Governor Pataki and the Public Service Commission say the state has pushed utilities to lower their prices for distributing power, and rates over all are lower than they would have been under a fully regulated system. They say 70 percent of Con Ed's rate increases in the last year has been due to higher prices for natural gas and oil; even if it had continued to regulate prices, the commission says, it would have had to allow Con Ed to pass those costs to customers. 
Independent industry experts largely agree with that estimate. But they warn that this summer could be very different from the last, when cool weather kept demand down. In a normal summer, power supplies are tight statewide, and they say California's crisis shows that when demand catches up to supply, deregulation allows generators to charge extremely high prices for power.
"I don't think last summer was a good basis for comparison," said Ira Freilicher, a lawyer for the New York Independent System Operator, or I.S.O., a nonprofit organization created under deregulation to run the wholesale power market. "Deregulation will exacerbate the price problem if there is a scarcity and we don't get supply."

The Market
Sometimes 2 Cents; Other Times, a Dollar
The crucibles where electricity prices are forged every day are the wholesale markets run by the I.S.O., where utilities and generators buy and sell power. And the way New York's I.S.O. sets prices -- the same method California uses -- makes price spikes sharper, said Dr. Richard Rosen, an opponent of deregulation and executive vice president of the Tellus Institute, an independent group that studies energy issues.
In New York's two markets -- a "day-ahead market" and a spot market that sells power an hour before it is needed -- the I.S.O. accepts offers to produce electricity at a particular price. The I.S.O. picks as many plants as it needs to keep the lights on, choosing the lowest bids first. Once all the demand for power has been met, the highest accepted offer sets the price all generators receive.
For example, plant owners might offer their power at prices ranging from 2 cents per kilowatt-hour upward, with most offers bunched between 5 and 10 cents. But a few offers might be as high as $1 per kilowatt-hour. On days when demand is close to overall supply, the I.S.O. has to buy that last bit of power, and under its rules every producer gets $1. Something like that happened a few times last summer, and it could happen more often as demand rises.
The idea behind the bidding system is that when supplies of power are adequate, generators will make bids close to their operating costs, because if they bid too high, their power plants may go untapped. In practice, when supplies are tight, generators can be certain almost any price will be accepted.
The system also encourages generators to bend bidding rules to move prices higher, said Richard Schuler, a member of New York's I.S.O. board. Generators that own several plants may even have a perverse incentive to take some of their supply out of service on hot days, since that can push up prices for the plants they do run. Though generators deny that such practices occur, the New York I.S.O. says it discovered 10 instances last year in which power suppliers manipulated the market. The most serious incident occurred June 26, when a generator withheld power from the market, making wholesale prices soar and costing consumers $100 million. 
Given the I.S.O.'s limited enforcement powers -- federal regulations prevent it from imposing fines or even publicly naming the generators that break its rules -- analysts say manipulation will increase if supplies tighten.
"You've kind of given the generators a get-out-of-jail-free card," said Dr. Frank A. Wolak, chairman of the market surveillance committee of California's I.S.O. "If they continue with the pricing in New York, where they pass through the wholesale pricing, and you guys have a hot summer, wow -- I wouldn't want to be at the New York I.S.O."
In theory, Con Ed could protect its customers from short-term price spikes by signing long-term, fixed-price contracts with generating companies, and some consumer advocates fault the utility for not locking up more supply. But Con Ed officials say the terms that generators are offering would lead to even higher rates.
Companies that buy and sell power are already expecting higher prices this summer. Natsource, a local trading company, is offering wholesale power in New York City at 13 cents per kilowatt-hour for July and August. Including Con Ed's transmission charges and other wholesale costs, that translates into a consumer rate of 23 or 24 cents per kilowatt-hour, or a monthly bill of about $120 for the average customer.
Prices may not go that high, especially if the summer is cool. But even at current levels, rates have businesses and consumers worried.
Derek Goins, vice president of operations for Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, said the hospital's electricity bill rose from $2 million in 1999 to $2.8 million last year, even though it used the same amount of power. "I'm frustrated," Mr. Goins said. "It's a piece of equipment you might not be able to buy."
Gene Barrett, a retiree in Queens, said he had adapted to his higher bills. "It's pinching," he said. "What scares me most of all is this summer -- is it going to keep going? There will come a point at which it will cut into more than disposable income."

The Future
Facing the Risks Of Repeating a Crisis
New York's power woes will not go away quickly or quietly. Discussions about how best to proceed are charged with ideology and politics.
Some economists and consumer advocates say controls on wholesale prices are needed to keep generators from overcharging when supplies are tight. In December, the Public Service Commission asked the I.S.O. to cap the wholesale price of power at 15 cents per kilowatt-hour, with limited exceptions.
But the I.S.O. strongly opposes price caps, which it says will lead to supply shortages, push generators to sell electricity to other states and actually raise wholesale prices. It favors a mechanism called a circuit breaker, which would give it more authority to lower generators' bids if it believes there is not enough competition in its markets. Apparently swayed by that argument, the commission has backed away from its proposal.
Deregulation's supporters say that instead of imposing caps, regulators should give the markets time to work. Supply will increase as new plants are built. Industrial customers and businesses will eventually get meters that show electricity use in real time, so they can cut back consumption as prices rise on days of peak demand. Because of the way the I.S.O. sets prices, that could lower rates for everyone. But the Public Service Commission has moved slowly to approve meters, citing complex technical problems. 
Governor Pataki says high prices have been decades in the making, and it is unrealistic to expect deregulation to be an immediate fix. "We want to have a vibrant wholesale marketplace that works," he said.
His critics say the state has not worked hard enough to increase supply or reduce demand. In fact, the most aggressive step the state has taken to increase supply -- pushing to install the small generators for New York City -- has the government intervening in a market it set out to deregulate. Although the plants will ease the city's short-term supply crunch, they put the state in competition with privately owned generators, which may be discouraged from building other new plants.
New York is at "medium to high risk" of repeating California's crisis, said George M. Knapp, a partner at the Coudert Brothers law firm who has studied both states' electric industries. But New York still has a little time, he said, and if it moves quickly to approve new transmission lines and power plants, it may sidestep disaster.
"Otherwise," he said, "you just step back and wait until it's your turn, like California."

Bayonne's Terminal Catches Hollywood's Eye

BYLINE:  By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: BAYONNE 

 BODY:
Can Opie help salvage the Military Ocean Terminal? Can the terminal be magically transformed into the land of Oz?
 Stay tuned. 
 The Military Ocean Terminal is a 437-acre peninsula, partly man-made, that juts two miles out from this working-class city into Upper New York Bay, equidistant from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the south and the tip of lower Manhattan looking north. Both are in spectacular view of the terminal, as are the green robes of the Statue of Liberty, the orange Staten Island ferries that move across the bay and the massive cranes of the Global Marine Terminal on the Port Jersey Peninsula in Jersey City, across a narrow channel. 
The views are no small matter in an effort by Bayonne to sell developers on the potential of the terminal. The Army seized the terminal for military use in 1941, and shipped out troops, armaments and supplies for every major conflict since World War II. At one time the terminal employed more than 3,000 Army personnel. The Army finally shut it down in 1999, at the behest of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission. 
Since the closing, Bayonne has signed a five-year master lease with the Army good through 2004, and beyond that, the city is asking the military to give back the peninsula. While Pentagon officials decide whether to give the city back the property -- a decision is expected this spring -- the lease allows Bayonne to sublet parcels of the peninsula and space in offices and warehouses left behind by the Army. 
In the long run, Bayonne hopes to attract housing, offices, a hotel or conference center, office and retail space and a port facility. In the meantime, the point of the lease is to generate some revenue to offset the loss of economic activity that resulted from the base closing.
That's where Opie and Oz come in. 
One of the subleases is to Universal Studios, which is using the space for production of "A Beautiful Mind," a movie starring Russell Crowe and directed by Ron Howard, who still looks a lot like Opie, the role he played on "The Andy Griffith Show." The film, due out in November, is based on a biography of John Forbes Nash Jr., a Nobel Prize winning economist at Princeton. 
Universal is leasing 20,000 square feet of office space in Building 82, a former Army administration building, plus another 80,000 square feet of warehouse space, where sets are now under construction. The six-month lease is worth a total of $600,000, paid to the Bayonne Local Redevelopment Authority, the entity created to market the property. 
"Oz," HBO's jailhouse drama produced by Tom Fontana, is also helping to tide over the Military Ocean Terminal. The show, which had been evicted from space housing its 60,000-square-foot prison set in Manhattan, is leasing 120,000 square feet of warehouse space, plus another 6,000 square feet of offices. That deal, also for six months, is worth $450,000. 
The production teams like the terminal for its proximity to New York, its large spaces, its affordability and even the fact that, as a military installation, it is still a no-fly zone, minimizing noise interference from commercial aircraft. And, of course, there is the view.
"I'm in SoHo and it took me 22 minutes to get here," said Todd Hallowell, executive producer of "A Beautiful Mind." "This is like driving to Universal Studios, except you can see the Statue of Liberty. You could never afford this at New York prices. 
Clearly, Hollywood has discovered Bayonne. The real-life image of Mr. Hallowell, in his sunglasses and champagne-colored sport utility vehicle, being waved through the terminal gate could have been spliced right into a Robert Altman film.
The Bayonne Local Redevelopment Authority is a public entity whose board members and executive director are appointed by Mayor Joe Doria, and whose dual mission is to market the property for short- and long-term use while negotiating the peninsula's transition from military to city ownership. The lease money pays for the commission's expenses, including a staff of four, plus miscellaneous improvements to the property. 
"A Beautiful Mind" and other productions, which have included various television commercials, benefit more than local officials and film gladiators, say members of the authority.
"They're contracting with local contractors, they're getting their dry cleaning done in Bayonne, they're going to Bayonne restaurants," said Nicholas A. Chiaravalloti, executive director of the redevelopment authority, referring to the production crews. "We're excited about having the film business down here. What we're even more excited about is to have the quality of people down here like Ron Howard and Tom Fontana."
But the Marine Ocean Terminal is not all about glamour. The redevelopment authority also sublets space to Hudson River Village, a 40-room hotel occupied mainly by Continental Airlines flight attendants; the Northeast Auto Marine Terminal, which is occupies 37 acres; and Bayonne Dry Dock and Repair, which uses the military's massive dry dock facility, occupied the other day by a 700-foot freighter. 
Other activity includes the removal of asbestos building panels by teams of Army contractors in white jumpsuits and gas masks, work Mr. Chiaravalloti said is being paid for by a $7 million grant secured by Representative Robert Menendez. It is still uncertain, however, who will pay for other environmental work necessary for development to proceed, like the removal of PCB's that leaked into the soil from old oil and gas tanks. 
Whatever the prospects, there seems to be a buzz. Mr. Chiaravalloti, a lawyer by training, said he is in negotiations with other production companies about leasing space, although he declined to say which ones. Mr. Hallowell said he became interested in the peninsula after hearing that Mr. Fontana had struck a deal here, and that others in the industry have been asking him about the area since he set up shop.
"You could build a back lot here," he said. 
Indeed, the broad alley flanked by old warehouses where Universal and HBO are now building sets has the feel of an old film studio, complete with a water tower ripe for a studio logo. Or at least, so says Lt. Martin Dziubek, a veteran Bayonne Police officer in charge of the peninsula, who drinks his morning coffee every day while taking in the spectacular views from the eastern bulkhead. "You can imagine a big WB logo up there," he said. "just like the old Warner Brothers studio."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Tax Fight; 
Where George Bush Leads, Who Will Follow?

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH was back on the campaign trail last week. This time, however, he was running not to win a job, but to show he could be effective in the job he had won. He wanted a sweeping tax cut -- $1.6 trillion over 10 years. And he strove to convince Americans, along with a critical mass in Congress, that his plan was both fair and prudent.
 For Mr. Bush, this is much more than just a piece of legislation. His across-the-board cut, centered on a reduction in tax rates, is a bid to exorcise family demons, solidify his conservative base and prove his claim that he is a politician who puts principle ahead of polls and popularity. 
 The tax cut is also the ultimate test of whether Mr. Bush can translate his personal charm and ambiguous mandate into the passage of something legislatively significant and politically difficult -- something that would represent a triumph of Republican over Democratic orthodoxy.
Although Mr. Bush's proposals for education get at least equal time in his discussions of his presidential priorities, those have intrinsically bipartisan elements.
"They don't define the Republicans from Democrats in any meaningful way," said Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group that supports tax cuts. "The Democrats could very easily be sponsoring the Bush education plan."
Not so with the tax cut, even though the Democrats have agreed to some sort of cut, and many have moved closer toward Mr. Bush's figure. They are still well below $1.6 trillion; a plan put forward by party leaders in Congress called for $750 million in tax reductions. And the degree to which Mr. Bush can close the gap between those figures -- or, at the least, make certain that any legislation cuts all tax rates, which many Democrats oppose -- will send a powerful signal to lawmakers and voters about Mr. Bush's political skills and powers of persuasion, leaving him stronger or weaker at the end.
"The tax cut is the foundation of the Bush presidency," said Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign. Mr. Reed said that was more true now than ever, because many developments since Mr. Bush first introduced his plan have worked in his favor, giving him fewer excuses for failure or major compromise.
"Between the Democrats embracing the idea of a tax cut, between Greenspan's comments, between the overall slowdown in the economy, between monster surpluses as far as the eye can see, he has gotten every break," Mr. Reed said. "Now's when he has to put the rubber to the road."
The economic conservatives in the Republican party certainly think so, and many of Mr. Bush's advisers acknowledged that, from the moment he began his presidential campaign at least two years ago, he has had more to prove to that part of the Republican base than to social conservatives.
Social conservatives had long recognized, in the way that Mr. Bush talked about giving up alcohol and turning to the Bible after turning 40 in 1986, the language of religious redemption and the cadences of Christian conservatism.
Mr. Bush had also forged relationships with people like Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the Christian Coalition, and James C. Dobson, the president and founder of Focus on the Family, during his father's 1988 presidential campaign, when one of Mr. Bush's roles was as a liaison to religious leaders.
But many economic conservatives were wary. Although Mr. Bush's surname gave him many advantages, it also saddled him with a few pieces of baggage, none heavier than the broken pledge of his father, former President George Bush, not to raise taxes.
The stakes attached to wooing and winning over these Republicans were raised by the publisher Steve Forbes's candidacy in the 2000 primaries. With plenty of his own money to spend, Mr. Forbes ran hard to Mr. Bush's right, advocating a flat tax of 17 percent and aggressively challenging Mr. Bush's commitment to lower taxes.
Several of Mr. Bush's campaign advisers said that the size of Mr. Bush's tax package, determined after considerable internal debate about offering something smaller and perhaps more palatable to centrist voters, was in part a response to Mr. Forbes.
NOW economic conservatives want Mr. Bush to deliver, and many Republican pollsters, including Fred Steeper, who worked on Mr. Bush's 2000 campaign, said these voters are no less numerous or passionate than social conservatives. 
"I think they're about equal," Mr. Steeper said, adding that a Republican who wants to keep his base energized and prevail in national elections cannot afford to disregard or alienate either group.
If Mr. Bush compromises too much during the coming tax debate, economic conservatives might well abandon him. In addition, it might undermine his own claim to sticking hard and fast to his convictions.
Mr. Bush spent much of the presidential campaign emphasizing the fact that he was pressing forward with his tax cut in spite of polls suggesting questionable public support for it. He made it a point of character.
"It's what distinguished him as a candidate in terms of not backing off on it no matter what the chattering class was saying," said one administration official.
Stephen Skowronek, a professor of political science at Yale University, said the scope of Mr. Bush's tax plan is also one of the issues that most starkly distinguishes most Republicans from most Democrats in an era when the two parties frequently look alike.
That makes this legislation a sort of Republican proving ground, given the party's control of both chambers of Congress and the White House for the first time in almost half a century.
"The only excuse now is that they have a slim majority," said Mr. Skowronek, author of "The Politics Presidents Make: Leadership from John Adams to Bill Clinton" (Belknap Press, 1993). "This is their best chance now to show the world what conservatism can deliver."

It's Up, It's Down: Playing Games With the Economy

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
TALK about a role reversal. There was Alan Greenspan, the last line of defense against irrational exuberance, the dour chaperone ever ready to take away the punch bowl, reassuring Congress that the economy should pull quickly out of its downturn and resume its upward trajectory.
 Yet on Wall Street, where bad news is usually repackaged as a buying opportunity, many economists were in a funk. "From our vantage point, both fundamental forces and cyclical indicators still suggest that our recession call is very much on track," economists at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter warned clients the day after the Federal Reserve chairman spoke. 
 And then there was President Bush, he of sunny disposition and breezy confidence, dismissing tentative evidence of a rebound as "one good statistic amongst a sea of pretty dismal statistics," and suggesting that failure to pass his $1.6 trillion tax cut would risk continued economic deterioration.
To some degree, their divergent and uncharacteristic assessments reflected the confusing signals sent out by the economy. But their differing perspectives are also a window into two distinct but related debates, one economic, one political, and both important in determining where the nation goes the rest of the year.
Mr. Greenspan generally tries to steer the economy free of politics, though he has thrown his weight behind tax cuts. But Mr. Bush, knowing full well that the interplay between the economy and politics could help decide the fate of his tax plan, has other ideas. 
Among economists, the question is whether this slowdown is merely a short, sharp period of readjustment to a more sedate pace of growth and a less frothy stock market, or whether it is the first step in the long, painful deflation of a bubble economy.
On that score, Mr. Greenspan is the head cheerleader for the more optimistic school. From his perspective, the United States is enduring a serious but transitory "inventory adjustment." That is when car dealers have too many S.U.V.'s on the lot or the plastics factory decides to hold off on its plan to double capacity.
Once supply and demand come back into balance -- a process Mr. Greenspan said was well along -- production and investment will pick up again. Most important, in the view of the Fed chairman and other optimists, the economy will continue to benefit from the huge sums businesses have spent on technology in a continuing drive to become more efficient. "The prospects for sustaining strong advances in productivity in the years ahead remain favorable," Mr. Greenspan said.
The pessimists think Mr. Greenspan's faith is misplaced. They see the collapse of technology stocks leading to cutbacks in investments by business in new technology -- and forcing retrenchment among consumers who expected stock market gains to pay for the nice vacation or the new BMW. If that happens, productivity gains and economic growth will remain sluggish for the foreseeable future. "Nasdaq giveth and Nasdaq taketh away," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, an investment firm. "We believe the U.S. is now in the grip of a recession." This debate will remain unresolved for months, if not longer. Meanwhile, the lack of certainty is itself a potential obstacle to recovery, some analysts say. 
"You've got confidence eroding daily because of the media treatment of the scary forecasts, and that's not a good thing," said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer for Wells Capital Management, an investment firm. "Then you've got a Fed that says there's no need to panic. So you've got a confidence meltdown and policy officials who are reluctant to address it."
A similar standoff is setting in among politicians.
With Mr. Bush suggesting that a vote against his tax cut could be a vote for higher unemployment, members of both parties are trying to assess just how bad the economy is. Some of them, as well as outside analysts, wonder if Mr. Bush is making it worse by accentuating the negative when consumer confidence is crumbling.
"By continuing to play that up now to get a tax cut, they are potentially making the reality of the economic situation worse than it would otherwise be," Mr. Paulsen said. 
All else being equal, tax cuts tend to give the economy a boost by putting more money into the hands of consumers. But history suggests that the cuts take so long to enact that any recession will have come and gone before any money flows back to taxpayers. And in the case of Mr. Bush's plan, a vast majority of the tax reduction would not take effect for years anyway.
NOT only has the president been criticized for compounding the drop in consumer confidence by emphasizing the negative, but he is exposing himself to a political risk. What if Mr. Greenspan is right and the economy is clearly recovering by summer, when Congress is expected to vote on the tax bill? In that case, Mr. Bush may lose support from moderates in both parties.
"There's always a temptation in advancing a policy initiative to grab any argument that's available," said Daniel Tarullo, a former economic adviser in the Clinton White House who is now a professor at Georgetown Law School. "It's an understandable temptation, but one which might create complications later on."

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania 

 BODY:
CENTRAL and Eastern Europeans think they have a deeper understanding of Russia and the Russians than anyone else, and given their wretched history since World War II, they should. Now they are deeply concerned about Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, who seems not just to be talking the talk of renewed empire, but walking the walk despite his country's manifold weaknesses.
 Mr. Putin has been emphasizing the defense of Russian national interests after the years of kowtowing to the West under Boris N. Yeltsin. While Mr. Yeltsin often seemed indifferent to events in the new countries of the former Soviet Union -- known in Moscow as "the near abroad" -- Mr. Putin insists they are part of Russia's "sphere of influence" and remain vital strategically. 
 That assertion is enough to upset those who used to live under Moscow's yoke, but now Mr. Putin's actions in countries like Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and Azerbaijan are having consequences for future East-West relations, even as they create more pressure for a new round of NATO enlargement. Already, there are increasing desires in Romania and the Baltic nations to get under NATO's umbrella as fast as they can.
While Mr. Yeltsin denounced NATO's expansion in 1999, he was mollified in part because Washington kept the first round small: Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. But then his inability to stop NATO's bombing war against Yugoslavia marked a nadir of Russian influence and set the stage for Mr. Putin to try to revive it.
"There is a new chapter; policy toward the near abroad has changed," said Istvan Gyarmati, a former diplomat who helped negotiate Hungary's entry into NATO. "Putin is a bit like Peter the Great, opening to the West for capital and technology but at the same time recentralizing Russia and reinforcing authoritarian rule, while exercising a more assertive foreign policy in the areas where he can."
Mr. Putin's national security adviser, Sergei Ivanov, recently warned the German defense minister, Rudolf Scharping, that NATO expansion "will create a fundamentally new situation in Europe that objectively infringes on Russia's political and military interests. This could lead to a serious crisis." Moscow has had similarly fierce words for European ears about President Bush's plans for national missile defense. But the harsh talk about the near abroad may be paving the way for even harder bargaining over what Mr. Putin really needs: Western capital and technology, along with an agreement from NATO to stop its expansion at the former Soviet border.
Since November, Russia has been more explicit about cutting natural gas supplies not just to collect on debts, but to influence policies in countries like Ukraine and Georgia, European and NATO officials say. Russia also has found reasons to delay or renege on political and military commitments to withdraw troops and shut bases in Moldova and Georgia. It has imposed visa requirements on Georgians and demanded use of Georgian territory to attack secessionists in Chechnya, a part of Russia itself. It has moved more rapidly toward unifying with Belarus and has discussed a similar treaty with the pro-Russian Communist Party in Moldova, which is expected to be the main part of a ruling coalition after parliamentary elections today.
RUSSIA wants badly to recreate its own early-warning radar system, which was broken by the collapse of the Soviet Union. While the Baltic countries won't play along, Moscow is pressing other nations of the near abroad to participate, including Ukraine. Moscow has also created a collective security organization with several central Asian states and has declared the Caspian Sea and its huge oil resources a Russian strategic interest.
On Jan. 18, Russia signed a military agreement with Ukraine, whose president, Leonid Kuchma, is in deep political trouble over allegations that he ordered the death of a journalist. Mr. Putin was in Kiev a week ago, emphasizing old ties and giving Mr. Kuchma a boost.
But Moscow is also pressing for a new natural gas pipeline to Europe through Poland, bypassing Ukraine -- a course that could put Ukraine at odds with Poland. Mr. Putin, who visited Azerbaijan in January as Russia's Caspian fleet exercised nearby, is also pressing hard for Caspian oil to go abroad through Russian pipelines and ports. He came away with an agreement from Azerbaijan to Moscow's notion of how to divide up the Caspian Sea.
Ukraine signed military cooperation agreements with NATO in 1997 and 1998 and has formed a joint peace-keeping brigade with Poland and Lithuania. But Russia's new military agreement with Ukraine now gives Russia a role in planning foreign military exercises on Ukrainian soil. That makes planned exercises with NATO much less useful, Mr. Gyarmati says, and NATO officials agree.
The elections in Moldova are another good example of the new Putin policy. Recently, Mr. Putin met in Moscow with the leader of the unreformed Moldovan Communists, Vladimir Vorodin; he also met with the centrist prime minister, Dmitru Braghis, apparently seeking agreement to a post-election coalition with the Communists. Romania's prime minister, Adrian Nastase, is carefully watching this. "We're very much interested in not being a buffer zone in this region," he said. "We have our own security interests, which is why we want to become a member of NATO and join by the 2002 summit in Prague."
Despite all the efforts to bring Moscow into a cordial relationship with NATO and the new post-cold-war tasks in the Balkans, the alliance remains the major deterrent to any future Russian expansion. Slovakia and Slovenia are obvious candidates for a next round of NATO expansion. Romania and the Baltic states are now pressing harder, but their candidacies are more difficult. (The fall of Slobodan Milosevic in Romania's neighbor Yugoslavia has made the Balkans less dangerous, and Romania is probably still too unstable. NATO membership for Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania would cross the Soviet "red line.") 
But perhaps the best example of the new Russian squeeze is in Georgia. Russian tactics there range from economic pressure, like cutting gas supplies and insisting on visas for the million or so Georgians who work in Russia, to demands that the Russians continue to use a military air base without Georgian oversight or permission, coupled with charges that Georgia is supporting the rebels in Chechnya.
"There is a definite change in attitude toward Georgia," said an official from a NATO country. He noted that Georgian officials seem frightened and unsure. "They used to talk about joining NATO as a goal," another analyst said. "Now they don't talk that way any more."

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush's First Battle 

 BODY:
After an unusually self-assured first month at the White House, President Bush is certain to get a warm personal welcome Tuesday night when he addresses Congress for the first time. But when Mr. Bush unveils his first budget recommendations on Wednesday, the reception is not likely to be as positive. Until now, he has not had to detail how he intends to pay for his big tax cut while also financing increases for defense and education. He indicated last week that he will urge restraint and even cuts in other areas, something that was not emphasized in his presidential campaign. In other words, once the proposals hit hundreds of desks on Capitol Hill, Mr. Bush and his optimistic White House team, who have shown a sure touch on public relations, will find themselves tested in the legislative arena.
 In the last few years of budget fights, both President Bill Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress preached fiscal restraint. Yet both sides racked up big spending increases for all their priorities. Mr. Bush knows that if that pattern holds, it will eat up the surplus and leave little room for his proposed $1.6 trillion tax cut. So he has to challenge the recent spending patterns. The question is which programs get cut, and how much the public will tolerate such cuts when so much money is being channeled into the tax reductions. 
 Mr. Bush may want to keep in mind some recent history. Back in 1981, an economic crisis and a powerful electoral mandate made it possible for President Ronald Reagan to persuade Congress to enact painful budget reductions along with his tax cuts. President George H. W. Bush was able to fend off Democratic demands for spending increases because there was a general recognition that the money was not there. He also had to agree to some tax increases to get Democrats to go along.
The word in Washington is that the Bush budget planners are already having difficulty selling spending cuts even to some moderate Republicans, especially in the Energy and Justice Department budgets. Any proposals to rein in spending in transportation aid, environmental enforcement, economic development or other areas will likely rankle some Republicans and many Democrats. The resistance will be felt in the appropriations subcommittees overseeing these areas.
Targeted cuts will be especially hard because President Bush wants to increase spending for education by 11 percent next year. It will not be clear how much he plans to increase military spending until the administration's defense review is completed, but he is already committed to $5.7 billion for military personnel and housing. The White House is said, however, to want spending increases of about 4 percent for the entire budget, excluding entitlement programs. That means a lot of programs will need to grow by less than the rate of inflation, translating into a cut in current services. 
Mr. Bush was already complaining last week about potential criticism when he said, "This is a town where if you don't increase the budget by an expected number, it's considered a cut." He is right politically, and while he would not put it this way, he has also defined the fiscal and political impact of his tax cut. It is twisting the entire budget out of shape in a very unhealthy way. It is too big, too weighted toward the rich and too unlikely to be of immediate help to the economy.
As Robert Reischauer, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, observes, the surplus has transformed the old patterns of budgetary debate. It is no longer a question of the wallet being empty. It is a matter of choosing between folks who need government programs and those who would get a tax windfall and saying to one group or the other, "I like somebody else better than you." President Bush has made his main choice clear. He wants to reward high-end taxpayers. He and we will start to see this week whether legislators looking ahead to the 2002 elections are inclined to be equally blunt.

HEADLINE: Bush Set to Offer Budget to Slow Costs and Cover Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
President Bush will present his first budget in the coming week, and administration officials say he will use it to show that he can restrain the growth in government spending, pay for his $1.6 trillion tax cut and make good on his promise to overhaul Social Security.
 Administration officials and budget analysts on Capitol Hill say Mr. Bush's budget, which he will discuss in an address to Congress on Tuesday night and release on Wednesday, will propose holding the growth in government programs outside of Social Security and Medicare to about 4 percent next year, down from 6 percent in the last three years. 
 They said Mr. Bush would assert that the spending increase was enough to address priority needs such as improving education and stepping up the pace of medical research, but not so much that he would have any problem paying for his tax cut, the centerpiece of his agenda this year. 
The projected budget surplus of $5.6 trillion over the next decade is so big, they said, that within as little as five years the government will find itself having paid off as much of the $3.4 trillion national debt as is possible to redeem up to that point.
As a result, they said, Mr. Bush's plan will point out that the government could have as much as $1 trillion in excess revenue from Social Security over the subsequent five years, money that could be used to establish private investment accounts in the retirement system. The creation of such accounts was one of Mr. Bush's main campaign promises, but is a polarizing issue that is sure to draw fire from Democrats.
Mr. Bush's budget will be released as the administration steps up its effort to build support for the 10-year $1.6 trillion tax cut. The president still appears short of the votes he needs in the Senate, where the two parties are divided 50-50.
"My budget blueprint will restrain spending, yet meet growing needs with a reasonable 4 percent growth rate, which is a little more than inflation," Mr. Bush said in his weekly radio address today. "After paying the bills, my plan reduces the national debt, and fast. So fast, in fact, that economists worry that we're going to run out of debt to retire. That would be a good worry to have." His tax plan, Mr. Bush said, "means real help for both American families and the American economy."
Budget analysts said the proposed 4 percent increase in spending for the military, the cabinet agencies and other general government operations would be slightly less than what the Congressional Budget Office calculates would be necessary to keep up with the rising costs of running the programs.
But the increase in so-called discretionary spending, to about $663 billion from $637 billion this year, would be distributed unevenly. Education would get $1.8 billion more than needed to keep up with inflation, and the National Institutes for Health, the government-financed center for medical research, would get $2.8 billion more. 
The Pentagon would get just enough to keep up with inflation next year -- about $322 billion, including money for nuclear programs administered by the Energy Department -- but would almost certainly get a much bigger increase in later years.
A variety of other programs are likely to be cut, from helping localities hire police officers to export subsidies for business. 
Some proposed cuts faced opposition even before they were included in the president's budget. The White House proposed that the Transportation Department cut spending on aviation by $568 million from the level assumed by last year's spending bills. The administration backed off after objections from airlines, private pilots and other groups.
The Energy Department asked for a $5 billion increase from its current level of $19 billion, but got only a small increase in a program to help low-income families insulate their houses.
But the administration has signaled that it does not intend to use its budget to wage the kind of broad ideological battles against big government that Republicans waded into six years ago after taking control of the House. 
Medicare, one of the targets of Republicans in 1995, will get a $21 billion spending increase next year, to $237 billion, Mr. Bush announced this week. The increase includes money for states to help their poorest retirees buy prescription drugs.
The budget will include a contingency fund that administration officials said could be drawn on for a broader prescription drug program and other likely needs such as increased military spending in coming years. It is unclear how much the administration will set aside for those programs. One adviser to Mr. Bush said that if the president's plan were enacted as proposed he would have several hundred billion dollars of unallocated surpluses outside of the Social Securityruity system available over the next few years. 
Including Social Security, Medicare and interest payments on the national debt, the total federal budget for next year is expected to be more than $1.9 trillion, up from $1.86 trillion this year.
Democrats criticized Mr. Bush's plans as unrealistic, and said they would keep up their attack on the administration's tax plan as too big and too tilted to the wealthy. 
"We want to give money back in tax cuts, and so do they," said Thomas Kahn, the staff director for the Democrats on the House Budget Committee. "The issue is who benefits and what programs get cut to finance their big tax cut."
Democrats said the president was substantially understating the cost of this tax cut, which they put at around $2.2 trillion. By delaying until next year his expected proposal for hundreds of billions of dollars in additional spending to modernize the military, the president is understating the nation's real spending needs, Democrats said.
To make his numbers add up, they said, Mr. Bush was relying on the nearly $400 billion of the surplus that was generated by Medicare, money that many members of both parties said should be off limits for tax cuts or new spending.
For the president and for the two parties in Congress, part of the challenge this year will be deciding how seriously to take the possibility that the surplus might be so big that it could outrun the national debt.
Although the total debt held by the public is now $3.4 trillion, about $800 billion of that is in savings bonds and government securities that would be expensive or impossible to redeem within the next decade. 
The level of nonredeemable debt is even higher in earlier years. With the two parties having agreed to dedicate to debt reduction the part of the surplus generated by Social Security -- $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years -- it is possible that the money available for debt reduction will exceed the level of redeemable debt starting as early as 2006. 
The amounts could be anywhere from a few hundred billion dollars to $1 trillion by 2011, the end of the 10-year period covered by current budget projections. If the money cannot be used for debt repayment, White House officials said, it would most logically be used to help establish private accounts through which individuals could buy stocks and bonds for their retirement.
Mr. Bush has said he will act later this year to develop a detailed plan for overhauling Social Security, probably through establishment of a bipartisan commission.

HEADLINE: Pyongyang Memo; 
North Koreans, Belts Tight, Cobble Up a Future

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: PYONGYANG, North Korea 

 BODY:
For most of a decade marked by shortages of food, fuel and other commodities North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, has exhorted his people to do more with less. And today, belt-tightening has even seeped into this capital city's fanciest hotel, the Koryo. Lights are kept dim, making it difficult to read. Well-furnished rooms hover just above freezing, warmed by space heaters.
 In a place where Americans may not leave the hotel unescorted and television sets have only one channel, guests spend a lot of time looking down at Pyongyang from 15 floors up. Insight comes in snippets of conversation and glimpses caught through windows. 
 Along the broad, empty streets in and around Pyongyang, there are two notable forms of transportation: feet and a smattering of high-end cars, many of them Mercedes-Benzes. Buses exist, but they are far rarer. 
Even on a bitterly cold day, what is most impressive in and around Pyongyang is the slow-moving stream of humans along every highway and street: mostly women with brightly colored head scarves and dark padded jackets of gray, blue or brown, lugging large cloth packs, sometimes fixed to frames of sticks.
Where are they going?
In these hard times, they are trading goods with friends or taking food to relatives, foreigners who have lived in North Korea say. They report to work, even if fuel shortages have forced their factory to operate at half speed, because government food allotments are tied to working.
And, on Fridays, they build monuments.
On a recent Friday afternoon, on a road heading out of the capital, white apartment blocks suddenly gave way to huge piles of dirt, and hundreds of busy men and women clustered around red banners. Each flag carries the name of a state work unit and these people -- mobilized from jobs as clerks, engineers and factory workers and the like -- are building a large new monument celebrating the hoped-for eventual reunification of the two Koreas.
They haul tiles, dig and transport dirt -- plugging along in freezing temperatures. In a country desperately short of spare parts and fuel, it is a decidedly low-tech operation. Shovels and picks rather than mechanized backhoes clear the ground.
In this way -- with lots of manpower and few machines -- the North Koreans have completed their public works projects in recent years, including a superhighway from Pyongyang to Nampo.
After a snow, Pyongyang is pristine under a bright blue sky, and it stays that way until the temperature rises, because there are apparently no snowplows. A landscape of whites, grays and tans is broken only by immense colorful portraits of Kim Il Sung, the country's founder (known as the Great Leader), or that of his son, "Dear Leader" Kim Jong Il.
A number of street corners boast these paintings, dominated by bright reds and blues, or statues the size of small houses. Hospital lobbies sport portraits of father, son or both communing with nurses. Schoolmasters treasure their picture of the Kims teaching enthusiastic students. Every person wears an enamel red pin bearing the senior Kim's likeness. No conference room is portrait-free.
Though neither Kim is seen in person by ordinary Koreans (the father is dead; the son famously reclusive), their personal touch is everywhere. At the University Hospital in Pyongyang, for instance, the only CAT scan -- a Hitachi -- was a 1991 birthday gift from Kim Jong Il, a proud doctor said. At the Folk Museum, a beautiful inlaid cabinet he once owned is set apart from the other furniture, displayed in a special glass case.
Kim Jong Il himself ordered the creation of a live-in preschool in Pyongyang to ease the burden on mothers who work -- like journalists, artists and teachers -- the school's headmistress gratefully explained. A middle-aged woman in a flowing traditional Korean dress, she added that it was Mr. Kim himself who wisely advised the teachers of the September 15th Kindergarten to "adjust the routine according to the age of the child."
Mr. Kim composed a piano piece that a young virtuoso performed at a school recital, she said. And in the cafeteria, the weekly menu (framed and hung) was devised for its nutritional content by you-know-who. Apparently no detail is too small for the attention of Mr. Kim, a kind of Leona Helmsley-cum-world-leader.
And on the surface at least, he seems to have won the reverence of North Koreans -- at least those allowed to talk to foreign journalists. When a reporter put her backpack down to tie her shoe in front of a portrait, several people spontaneously rushed over to chastise her for being disrespectful.
But of course, from birth North Koreans are taught whom to believe in. At orphanages and preschools, children sing songs about "trusting the Great Leader." 
They are also taught whom to hate.
At one school, a group of 5- and 6-year-old boys performing for some American visitors sang a brisk, hate-filled ditty directed at the Japanese for their often repressive occupation of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945. With each chorus, the small boys pantomimed shooting Japanese policemen.
(Japan is now a major provider of food aid to the North. An unbidden thought: Had the audience this day been Japanese aid donors, would the target have been Americans?)
At Pyongyang's chilly but interesting Folk Museum, a friendly tour-guide committed the political equivalent of a Freudian slip as she lectured six visiting Americans about traditional fishing techniques: After searching for the English name for a fish (it was perch), and chatting about the difficulties of translating for English speakers, she referred to Americans as "U.S. imperia. . . " -- before catching herself. Old habits. 
And it is, similarly, sometimes hard for a "U.S. imperialist" to see past North Korea's reputation as the world's strangest "rogue state" and perhaps the world's most heavily militarized country for its size.
Foreign experts estimate that about 5 percent of North Koreans -- one million people -- are in the armed forces. And soldiers, like scraggly mountains, are ubiquitous features of the North Korean landscape.
In Pyongyang, soldiers in gray-green padded winter uniforms dot the streets. They shovel snow or repair roads. Unsmiling, they man the checkpoints that ring the capital, deciding who may enter and who will be turned away. 
On one drive out of Pyongyang, several soldiers -- guns in hand and cornstalks waving out of their backpacks for camouflage -- were marching over a low hill, apparently engaged in military exercises. Even at tourist sites, soldiers out to see the sights are numerous enough that the government's prohibition on photographing military personnel can make it difficult to take a snapshot.
Against this backdrop, it is easy for foreigners to jump to conclusions: On a recent snowy Friday, a small group of visitors representing Western aid groups were bused to the Tong Myun Tombs on the outskirts of Pyongyang. (Work and meetings were out of the question because -- it being Friday -- so many North Koreans were busy with monuments.) Suddenly, a distant thuk-thuk-thuk sounded over the hills. The foreigners agreed that it sounded like gunfire. One finally asked: "What's that?"
Their young North Korean minder smiled and said: "Just a tractor. But you Americans! You thought it was a tank! Right?"
Still, here and there, one sees small signs of change. At the Koryo Hotel, staff members who two years ago were by all accounts surly and distant are now warm and hospitable, bringing hot water and extra blankets to compensate for the lack of heat.
With the state providing less food, the government has even tolerated a whiff of private enterprise. City dwellers raise pigs and chickens in apartments. The private farmers markets -- which used to occur two or three times a month -- are now daily occurrences. Along the roadside, a woman was selling cigarettes, most likely smuggled from China, from under her coat.
And money -- even foreign currency -- is creeping into what was previously a nearly cashless economy, where people lived on government provisions. In the past, holding American dollars was dangerous; ordinary people had few places to spend them and faced certain trouble if the security forces found out. But today, dollar bills have become a much-valued currency.
And some people seem to have a lot of them. While the Koryo Hotel is short on light and heat, its first-floor restaurant still serves an impressive bulgogi, a traditional Korean beef barbecue. And though the food is expensive -- and priced in dollars -- the restaurant is generally packed, with foreign guests as well as a number of North Koreans.
At the cashier's desk on a recent night, three young men wearing remarkably well-tailored black Mao-type suits and Kim Il Sung pins chatted casually as the waitress tallied their tab, a long mix of food and alcohol. When she announced the total, no one blinked. One nonchalantly pulled a crisp $100 bill out of his wallet.

HEADLINE: Inside Dope; 
Absolutely Fatuous

BYLINE:  By Horacio Silva, Ben Widdicombe, Melissa de la Cruz and Lee Carter; Chic Happens appears every Wednesday on Hintmag.com.

 BODY:
 Fashion fortunes yo-yoed like the Nasdaq last year, with winners including the model supe du jour Gisele Bundchen, the Guess girl turned millionaire widow Anna Nicole Smith and Donna Karan, who outraged investors but increased her personal wealth when she sold her trademark to LVMH at a marked-down price. Not so lucky was Petey, the Karan family pooch, mauled to death by a swan in Central Park. Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren took a beating of a different kind, being pummeled by plummeting stock prices. But life-affirming moments were just around the corner: Lauren donated $5 million to establish a cancer center in Harlem; Gucci's Tom Ford bankrolled Alexander McQueen's own label, offering him a way out of his messy relationship with LVMH; the new retail conglomerate Pegasus put its money on the designers Daryl Kerrigan and Miguel Adrover; and the organizers of the otherwise emetic Vogue/VH1 Fashion Awards at least had the sense to deny John Galliano permission to present an award naked (he settled instead for an atomic-yellow corset accessorized with an American Indian headdress). Some people love fashion for the frocks, but for us, the monumental egos, backstage back-stabbing and absolutely fatuous goings-on are what make the industry the unrivaled spectacle that it is. 

KLEIN AGAINST NATURE
He's been accused in the press of glamorizing the drug culture and sexually objectifying children, but even Calvin Klein was taken by surprise when he was blamed last February for India's soaring rat population. The Indian minister of social justice and empowerment, Maneka Gandhi, berated the designer for using snakeskin in his fall collection. "The snake is the main ally of the farmer in Asia," said the miffed minister, pointing out that snakes eat rats that would otherwise be gorging on rice crops. Gandhi urged Klein "to withdraw this season's snake collection and vow never again to use any part of the animal." Soon Klein had rats of a different kind on his mind, when he fell out with his longtime brand licensee Linda Wachner of Warnaco. In court papers he accused the company of "the equivalent of counterfeiting" by manufacturing unauthorized goods and off-loading full-price merchandise to discount warehouses. If his lawsuit isn't successful, expect Klein to follow up his latest fragrance, Truth, with Consequences.

IMMACULATE COLLECTION
Not content to parody the homeless with his collection of hobo couture, John Galliano incensed journalists and Christians at his eponymous show in October. The collection -- described by Suzy Menkes in The International Herald Tribune as a "horrendous parade of hideous outfits" -- included five male models dressed as Jesus. The longhaired hunks in athletic shorts, sneakers and thorny gold crowns were intended as a comment on the deification of English soccer stars, but didn't score well with true believers. Journalists were already appalled that Galliano had the gall, or laziness, to plagiarize his own Christian Dior show, sending out warped Cubist renderings of what he had previewed two days before. Galliano also included controversial scribbles on garments, including the words "tax evasion," which many inferred as a swipe at Karl Lagerfeld's tax troubles. Look for Warnaco's knockoff Christian Dior sleeping bags for the homeless.

FASHION STATEMENT
The Austrian right-wing extremist Joerg Haider made his first appearance on the catwalks of Milan last February, to rousing applause. The Italian fashion house Gattinoni showed a skirt with Haider's likeness crossed out, a swastika and the word "No!" in big red print. "Everyone has to stand up and defend human rights," Gattinoni's creative director, Guillermo Mariotto, later told journalists. "I am doing it in my own way -- not with guns but with skirts."

HARD LABOR
Officials at Milan's notorious San Vittore jail -- aka "Hell's Kennel" -- hit on a novel way to distract overcrowded inmates from their famously miserable living conditions. As part of a pioneering prison work program, convicts have been doing time assembling a new range of Giorgio Armani leather handbags. With lira-pinching innovations like these, no wonder Armani is the richest Italian since Caligula. San Vittore is also the current residence of Patrizia Martinelli, who was convicted in 1998 of murdering her fashista husband, Maurizio Gucci. We wonder whether Martinelli might be following the lead of Monica Lewinsky -- who includes the personal message "Made Especially for you by Monica" inside each of her signature handbags -- by sending instructions to her mates stitched inside each bag's lining.

KIDDIE COUTURE
Logomania spread from the catwalk to the creche this year, with top designers launching layette collections. Gucci booties, pint-size Prada, Baby Dior sweaters and even Bulgari Petit Maman perfume appeared on fashion-forward baby shower lists all over the country. The socialite Marie-Chantal of Greece and the model Stella Tennant both launched eponymous collections for newborns: Marie-Chantal's line is embroidered with her husband's family crest, while the Burberry-backed Tennant & Son features cashmere leggings and cardigans. Wee Wolford fish-nets and Helmut Lang baby bondage gear can't be far behind. We bet Mario Testino won't be lining up to shoot that campaign.

TRITE YOUNG THINGS
Speaking of dressing up baby: airhead heiresses came into their own last year, as American designers made a barefaced play for the next generation of Park Avenue matrons. Michael Kors's Spring "Palm Bitch" look took several pages from "The Official Preppy Handbook," while his fall "10021" collection was a shameless suck-up to the ladies who lipo. Josh Patner and Bryan Bradley of Tuleh also churned out insta-couture (ostrich feathers! mink jeans jackets!) for trust-fund twentysomethings. Glossies like Vanity Fair lapped it up with odes to the It Girl, and gossip columns made boldfaced names out of Nicky and Paris Hilton. By the end of the year, the movement had a D.I.Y. handbook in Brooke de Ocampo's "Bright Young Things." But as the economy softens in months to come, expect the media interest in Nicky and Paris Hilton to age about as well as their great-grandfather's hotel chain.

HEAVY PETA
They served Anna Wintour a dead raccoon at the Four Seasons, threw a tofu pie at Michael Kors's spring-summer show and splattered the front-row habitues Elsa Klensch and Phillip Bloch with red paint at the Randolph Duke show. But by June, shenanigans by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals began to wear thin as activists yelled antifur diatribes from the Lincoln Center balcony while Valentino accepted his lifetime achievement award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Even models are tiring of it: the best celebrity mouthpiece PETA could get last year was the pop has-been Carnie Wilson, who has recently been publicizing her gastro-intestinal bypass, which, by the way, was carried live via an Internet Webcast. Look for further trouble later this year around the Los Angeles designer Jared Gold, who had a live jewel-encrusted giant Madagascar cockroach brooch as part of his collection.

ROMANCING THE CLONES
The most star-crossed courtship since Luke and Leia finally came to an end this year when the bland bombshell Claudia Schiffer split with her financially challenged fiance, Tim Jeffries. Having helped shape the Slovakian government in its last elections, and mended race relations in a recent movie, Schiffer just didn't have the time to spend on fixing her troubles at home. She isn't the only supermodel to have slipped through the (generously sized, we hear) fingers of Jeffries: he also loved and lost Elle Macpherson and Ingrid Seynhaeve. For her part, Schiffer within a month was being linked with the former Calvin Klein exec Neil Kutnetz and the film star Robert Vaughn's son, Matthew. The split came in a year of fashion fissures, including one between Anna Wintour and her husband, and DKNY's model couple, Esther Canadas and Mark Vanderloo. Thank heavens Naomi Campbell and Flavio Briatore are still seen together at functions. If it weren't for those two lovebirds, we'd lose hope completely.

SHORT ATTENTION SPAN
Ivana Trump's foray into vanity publishing, Ivana's Living in Style, went the way of her failed marriages after only two issues. Ivana had set a cracking pace with the debut issue, which in its 80-plus pages had, by some counts, no fewer than 56 pics of herself. . . . In what is bound to sweep the industry as a money-saving trend, the British media group IPC (publishers of Marie Claire, Nova and Loaded, among others) told one of its top women's glossies to eliminate restaurant bills by taking sandwiches to celebrity and fashion shoots. . . . "I'm a man, I have a penis," Tom Ford clarified to The New York Times. . . . Wild and ker-azy Alexander McQueen showed his most recent eponymous collection in a space decked out like a mental institution. . . . The boyish braggadocio continued between the Gucci capo Domenico De Sole and his LVMH rival, Bernard Arnault, who traded corporate blows all year. God help them if they should ever meet at a pissoir. . . . In a post-postmodern twist, the bargain-bin bricolage poster kids Imitation of Christ were "sampled" by a renegade fashion group calling itself Imitation of Imitation of Christ (IOIOC). . . . Prada paid a reported $45,000 to the French Communist Party to hold a function at its Paris headquarters. . . . Gisele was served a subpoena backstage at Ralph Lauren by her former agent, John Casablancas.* Pauline Trigere designed a fashion range for seniors, including a strap-on pouch for walking frames. . . . Thieves reportedly broke into the East London studio of the bad-boy artists Jake and Dinos Chapman, taking with them a series of photos of supermodel sphincters, including Kate Moss's. We wonder whether it will show up as the new Versace pattern.

A Lot of Pluribus, Not Much Unum

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
ON the day allied warplanes launched their most recent strikes near Baghdad, an American-Iraqi encounter of a different kind was taking place in Washington.
 Frank Ricciardone, a senior State Department official, met with representatives of Saddam Hussein's exiled opponents, carrying on a relationship that has been unfolding in various guises since the United States began cultivating the London-based exiles after the 1990-91 gulf war. Like the air strikes, economic sanctions and efforts to rid Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, the idea of cultivating President Hussein's opponents is part of the broader effort to oust him and replace him with a gentler, friendlier Iraqi leadership, however improbable that might sound. 
 The Clinton administration earmarked over $100 million in funding for the exiles to promote mildly subversive operations, like a newspaper and a radio station and training for President Hussein's opponents in skills ranging from computer literacy to the art of running a benevolent civilian society -- unfamiliar territory given Iraq's modern history of coups, war and state violence. 
But, as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell meets with Mideast leaders and the Bush administration begins to come to grips with the complexities of this unpredictable campaign, the links between Washington and the Iraqi National Congress exile movement pose two questions for President Bush: should the United States be offering political cooperation or more hard-nosed backing for armed revolt? And will the squabbling factions of the opposition ever be able to deliver?
Indeed, sensing a possible shift under a Republican administration that was quick to prove its credentials in Iraq with the bombing raids, many of the exiled factions are pressing Washington for the kind of aid that would enable them to launch an insurgency from the Kurdish-dominated strongholds of northern Iraq. But that is coupled with a demand for guarantees to come to the aid of the insurgents against a likely Iraqi counteroffensive, a step that Washington, once burned, is twice-shy to contemplate.
The burn was in 1996, when a covert American military training operation in northern Iraq ended disastrously as infighting between two groups of the regime's Kurdish opponents prompted one to invite the Iraqi Army to join the fray, with bloody and humiliating results.
The fighting has eased since then, but the fractiousness endures. The Iraqi National Congress, formally created in 1992, is an umbrella for dissident Iraqi groups of widely ranging political flavors, from constitutional monarchists to Islamists. And it is built around the same two Kurdish groups, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Popular Union of Kurdistan, that were at the center of the 1996 debacle.
While the Kurdish north of Iraq, protected by an allied no-fly zone, represents the only area of Iraq where opponents may operate with a modicum of autonomy, there are other groups that also claim credentials, like the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, an Iranian-sponsored group among the Shiites of southern Iraq, and the Iraqi National Accord, which has sought to foment conspiracy among the Sunni-dominated officer class.
 MODERN history offers the exiles little encouragement.
Where exiled groups like the African National Congress in South Africa have come to power, it is with some credentials as a credible alternative to an unjust regime, often reinforced by military campaigns that, if nothing else, betoken their ability to physically challenge and harass their adversaries. And those adversaries were ultimately prepared to negotiate. Very little of that applies to Iraq.
Over the years, Mr. Hussein has crushed insurgencies, used chemical weapons against his own people and bloodily repressed dissent even within his own family entourage. If he has co-opted adversaries, it has been to neutralize them. 
That same catalog of horrors and inducements also explains his political longevity. The selective, exemplary and often terrible use of violence and the seductions of privilege have driven home to all Iraqis the rewards of conformity and the price of dissent, Charles Tripp, a prominent British scholar, said in a recent study.
Dictators, of course, rarely govern simply by brute force.
In Iraq, said Mr. Tripp, from London's School of Oriental and African Studies, President Hussein's immediate entourage is rooted in a handful of family, clan or regional affiliates, but his largesse spreads outward to a broader community of supplicants, possibly numbering with their dependents up to 500,000 of Iraq's 20 million people. And their loyalty is based on the belief that they would lose everything if he were to be overthrown and a new dispensation of power established in Baghdad.
Indeed, as a new American administration ponders its options in Iraq, there is, perhaps, an example closer to home of the limits on Washington's success in supporting the exiled foes of a repressive regime hobbled by American sanctions -- not in Iraq, but in Fidel Castro's Cuba.
So why bother to support Mr. Hussein's adversaries at all? The answer to that is the only simple factor in the entire equation. "We think that it is important not to discount people who are willing to stand up against Saddam Hussein," said an American official with long experience in the region. "It would be wrong for us to shut these people off as not worth our time."

HEADLINE: Iraq Defiant as U.S. Lobbies Arabs on Shift in Sanctions 

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
As the Bush administration tries to build international consensus around a new, perhaps less punitive sanctions regime against Iraq, the reaction in the Iraqi capital runs from the contempt of Saddam Hussein to something resembling a weary, believe-it-when-we-see-it shrug among the 23 million ordinary Iraqis who have endured a decade of incremental misery.
 President Bush's meeting on Friday with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, which focused on the shift to so-called "smart" sanctions, was dismissed in Iraq's state-controlled newspapers today as a continuation of "Anglo-Saxon aggression." This began, in Iraq's view, when the United States and Britain led an allied military force that ousted Iraqi troops from Kuwait and won endorsement for the harshest United Nations sanctions applied against a member state. 
 With the 10th anniversary of the Persian Gulf war defeat of Iraq being observed in Kuwait on Monday, there is nothing here to encourage expectation that the Baghdad leadership will prove more amenable to the modified sanctions that the United States and Britain have proposed. 
On the contrary, judging by the fulminations from senior aides to Saddam Hussein and from Iraqi newspaper commentaries today, Iraq believes that it can outlast the United States and Britain, using propaganda and diplomacy in the Arab world to win complete abandonment of the sanctions.
The voice of Saddam Hussein's Baghdad was as shrill as ever as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell arrived in Egypt today at the start of a six-nation Middle East tour aimed at winning support from Iraq's closest neighbors for the fresh approach. The new policy has been urged by Washington and London as a means of maintaining pressure on Iraq to stop developing nuclear, biological and chemical weapons -- an effort Iraq says it has abandoned but the United States and Britain say it has not -- while allaying concerns that Iraqis are being deprived of food and medicine.
"The small criminal Bush met with his British tail," the newspaper al Qadissiya, government-controlled like all others in Iraq, said on its front page today.
On the proposal for a new sanctions regime, which Iraqi newspapers have previously described as poisoned, the newspaper predicted that the Americans and British would fail in their bid to round up a new anti-Iraq consensus and thus deepen the hostility engendered by the two nations' bombing of what they said were Iraqi radar installations around Baghdad on Feb. 16.
In a similar tirade on Thursday, the official newspaper of the ruling Baath party, al Thawra, described the effort to shore up the sanctions by abandoning or scaling back those that had been blamed for malnutrition, disease and death as a last-ditch bid to rescue a failed policy. "These 'smart' sanctions are nothing but a desperate and stupid attempt to exit the dead-end road reached by American and British policies against Iraq," it said. 
"The 'smart' sanctions focus primarily on controlling Iraq's financial resources, and restrict Iraq's diplomacy under the pretext of preventing it from arming itself," said the newspaper, which is considered a reliable indicator of the thinking of Saddam Hussein, who is leader of the Baath party as well as president and prime minister. "In other words, they aim at putting Iraq's economic, political and military potential in the hands of American and British enemies -- a complete colonialist hegemony."
The Iraqi leader himself made no reported comment on the Washington meeting. But his trade minister appeared at an international technology fair in Baghdad -- the first ever held here, and a fresh signal, according to Iraqi officials, of how far the old sanctions regime has eroded -- and added his voice to the barrage of contempt.
"Our right is to export any commodity, whatever we can, and to buy any commodity that Iraqis require," the trade minister, Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, said at a news conference. "There cannot be walls between countries."
Judging the mood among ordinary Iraqis was more difficult, given the tight monitoring of foreign reporters and virtually all their conversations, effected through minders assigned to the reporters by the Information Ministry. But on the long overland journey from Jordan, 400 miles across the desert from Baghdad, and in the restaurants, bazaars and hospitals of the Iraqi capital, there seemed to be little enthusiasm at the news from Washington, and little hope that the everyday privations of the last decade will be eased.
How much of this dispiritedness is a result of exhaustion from the years of war and isolation -- Iraq fought an eight-year war with Iran in the 1980's that severely depleted the country's resources before the Kuwait invasion -- is impossible to say.
But along with the denunciations of the United States that are standard coda in any monitored conversation with an Iraqi, there were hints that many people here no longer care, if they ever did, whether their miseries are a result of the sanctions, as Mr. Hussein maintains, or the consequence of a cynical manipulation of the sanctions by the ruling elite in Baghdad, as Washington and some -- but not all -- United Nations sanctions reports have maintained.
Under the sanctions imposed after the gulf war, Iraq is allowed to sell a certain amount of oil, with the money going into United Nations-administered accounts that can be used for buying vital supplies like food and medicine.
Rising oil prices have increased revenue from this system sharply over the last year. Western officials also assert that Iraq is smuggling oil abroad and possibly using the revenue from those sales to rebuild its weapons program, allegations that Iraq denies.
At the al-Karam border post, at the frontier with Jordan, chaos runs through the night as traders, middle men and opportunists of every stripe elbow for the favor of Iraqi frontier officials, and the entry into Iraq that gives them access to an economy grotesquely distorted by the corruption and back-pocket dealings that have proliferated under sanctions.
One Iraqi official, momentarily out of earshot of his colleagues, sighed when asked about the possibility of sanctions being eased. "You know, mister," he said, "sanctions don't hurt governments, they hurt people. Presidents are not hurt by sanctions."
Much the same mood seemed to prevail at the Saddam Children's Hospital in Baghdad, where case-wearied doctors do rounds with reporters without, in some cases, bothering with the praise of Mr. Hussein or denunciations of the United States that have been routine for years. What matters most is that children suffering from bacterial meningitis or lymphocitic leukemia -- often fatal conditions that have mushroomed in recent years, by Iraqi and United Nations counts -- lack basic medicines and equipment to help keep them alive.
Whether this is because the government fails to buy medical supplies through the United Nations, as Washington contends, or because of the sanctions themselves, seemed secondary. Only after being asked several times did one mother, Suha Jassim, tending to a 6-year-old son with meningitis in the intensive care ward, say who she blamed for the situation. "America," she said, finally. And George W. Bush, the new president? "Him, too," she said. "He hates the Iraqi people, and that's why he sent his planes to bomb us."

HEADLINE: U.S. AND RUSSIANS MEET ON DEFENSES AGAINST MISSILES 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
On his first overseas trip as America's chief diplomat, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell plunged into talks today with the Russian foreign minister over differences on plans for a missile defense. They agreed to hold an expert-level dialogue on both offensive and defensive weapons, officials on both sides said. 
 The 90-minute discussion with Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov, who met General Powell at his initial stop in Cairo, was part of a three-day tour by General Powell of five Arab countries, the Palestinian territories and Israel. The Bush administration describes the tour as part of a reassessment of American policy in which it hopes to gain new support for sanctions against Iraq. 
 The meeting with Mr. Ivanov was the first encounter between the Bush administration and the Russian government of President Vladimir V. Putin. It came at the end of a week in which the Russians began floating an alternative before America's NATO allies to the more ambitious missile defense plan of the United States. 
Afterward, General Powell described the talks as "very, very excellent," though Mr. Ivanov was less exuberant and officials provided few details of the discussions. 
A senior State Department official said the talks covered "the waterfront" -- from Washington's concerns about Russian abuses in its war against separatists in Chechnya to questions of press freedom in Russia. The Russians made a request to continue meetings between experts on both sides about offensive and defensive weapons, and the Americans agreed. 
"We agreed it needs dialogue on all levels, including at the expert level, and we agreed that we should begin such a dialogue as soon as possible," Mr. Ivanov said through an interpreter at a separate news conference after the meeting, which took place at a motel adjacent to the Cairo airport. 
Groups of experts had already been set up during the Clinton administration and used to discuss reductions in offensive weapons and ideas on defensive systems, the American official said. He said no date had been set on the first new meetings of these groups, which would be reconstituted by the Bush administration with its own officials. 
On Iraq, the official said, Mr. Ivanov agreed on the American goal that the sanctions should be used to eliminate Saddam Hussein's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. 
Before traveling on to Israel, General Powell met in Egypt with President Hosni Mubarak and, the official said, Mr. Mubarak told the secretary that the sanctions against Iraq were not working in their current form and were harming the Iraqi people, and not the Iraqi leadership. 
The Egyptian leader, however, also agreed that the goal of the sanctions should be to eliminate Mr. Hussein's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. The American official said Mr. Mubarak offered no new ideas of how to reshape the sanctions -- a prime goal of General Powell's trip -- and said simply, "I hope you succeed." 
At a news conference with the Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa, Egyptian journalists were extremely critical of American policy toward Iraq, and Mr. Moussa himself said he did not believe that Iraq presented a threat to Egypt, but that he understood sentiment was different in Kuwait, which Iraq invaded a decade ago. 
In Israel, General Powell was scheduled to meet tonight with the caretaker prime minister, Ehud Barak, and on Sunday with Mr. Barak's successor, Ariel Sharon. He was also scheduled to meet with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, at his West Bank headquarters in Ramallah. The meeting was originally planned for Gaza, where anti-American protests have been particularly virulent, but moved because of security concerns. 
General Powell will discuss with both the Palestinian and Israeli leaders ways to reduce the months of violence between the two sides, which has left hundreds dead. But in contrast to the last years of the Clinton administration, a peace deal is not high on the agenda. 
Speaking to reporters on the plane en route to Cairo, General Powell said his discussions with Mr. Ivanov were part of what he described as a long, and probably arduous, process of explaining to the Russians the Bush administration's determination to move ahead on missile defense. 
His early impression of the Russian proposal on missile defense, first given to the NATO secretary general, Lord Robertson, earlier this week, was that it was quite thin in content, General Powell said. 
"There isn't a lot there yet that we can get our teeth into," he told reporters on the plane. 
The Russian proposal concentrates on "theater" missile defense for Europe, which the secretary described as "a different kind of system" from the more ambitious one proposed by the Bush administration. 
But General Powell acknowledged that the Bush administration had not yet determined precisely what kind of missile defense it would ultimately like to build. "We're still working on our concept and program," he said.
Because of the very early stages of the administration's plans, "there's more than enough time before we have to move forward with our concept and programs to discuss this with the Russians and the Chinese," General Powell said.
Before meeting Mr. Ivanov, General Powell, who has already seen 25 foreign ministers and heads of state since taking office, set a slightly warmer tone than that of Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld. 
The defense secretary caused a stir in Moscow by calling Russia "an active proliferator" of weapons technology to countries like "Iran and North Korea and India." In reply, Russian officials had said the Bush administration should stop likening Russia to the "evil empire."
En route to Cairo, General Powell recalled his "long record of interaction with Russian leaders over the years," as national security adviser and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the first Bush administration. "If one speaks openly and candidly," he said, "you can make progress as long as you don't shy away from the tough issues and as long as you don't forget that there are many areas of interest that we have in common."
He said that he did not expect the arrest this week of an F.B.I. agent, Robert Philip Hanssen, as a spy for Russia to come up in his talks with Mr. Ivanov. 
General Powell's trip to the Middle East coincides with the 10th anniversary of the Persian Gulf war, which drove Iraqi forces from Kuwait but left Mr. Hussein in power. Along with Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf and former President George Bush, General Powell will be among those saluted in a ceremony in Kuwait on Monday. 
But the State Department emphasized that General Powell was in the region because of the urgent need to consult about Mr. Hussein and repair Washington's relations with the rest of the Arab world, not because of the pageantry on Monday. 
While General Powell would like the focus of his trip to be how to retarget the sanctions against Iraq, Arab leaders are still more likely to stress the violent conflict between the Palestinians and Israel, which have produced rising anger among Arab populations. 
In addition, the American and British airstrikes against Iraq eight days ago has generated varying criticism from all Arab states, something General Powell acknowledged could complicate his mission. 
"To the extent that makes my job and my work a little more difficult, well, so be it," he said. 
The secretary said he may not have an easy time persuading the moderate Arab states about the need to tighten some sanctions against Mr. Hussein. The leaders in Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Egypt have all complained that the economic sanctions have failed to punish Mr. Hussein, but have succeeded instead in punishing ordinary Iraqis. 
General Powell acknowledged in his briefing with reporters that the United States was "taking the heat, losing the support of the Arab on the street" in its efforts to counter Mr. Hussein. 
"We need to turn the debate onto his actions as opposed to our actions," General Powell said, adding that it was Mr. Hussein who was "threatening the region, not the United States."
In outlining his approach on Iraq to the reporters, General Powell described what amounted to preventing Mr. Hussein from obtaining military equipment as well as items that can be used for both civilian and military purposes. 
That approach appeared to hint at a move away from the blunt tool of economic sanctions and toward more targeted military sanctions as a way of getting at the most important threat from Mr. Hussein: his programs to develop biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. 
On the question of Chinese telecommunication workers helping Iraq with its defense abilities, General Powell said the Bush administration had sent the Chinese government a second demarche this week following one delivered in January. The Chinese replied that they were "looking into the matter," the secretary said.

HEADLINE: What Kind of Party for the Democrats? 

 BODY:
The continuing controversy over President Clinton's pardons of Marc Rich and others has placed leaders of the Democratic Party in a quandary. In some ways, the last few weeks have been harder on Mr. Clinton's supporters than even the battle over impeachment. Some have strongly criticized his pardon decisions, and many were embarrassed by questions over gift-taking as he and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton left the White House. 
 Yet Mr. Clinton's legacy of economic prosperity and his record on welfare reform, the environment and civil rights remain central to the Democratic agenda. The Op-Ed Page asked prominent Democrats and political commentators how the party can refashion its message, regain the public's trust on ethical issues and position itself to become the majority party in Congress in two years.

Robert B. Reich, secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton and author of "The Future of Success."
 The seemingly interminable Clinton scandals are not the Democrats' biggest problem, and merely distancing themselves from Bill Clinton (or Hillary Rodham Clinton) won't restore the party's soul. 
The Democratic establishment in Washington is no longer connected to the grass roots. The national party is nothing but a fund-raising machine. Terry McAuliffe, head of the Democratic National Committee, is distinguished mostly by his ability to wrestle dollars from donors. The Democratic Leadership Council is distinguished mostly by its opposition to organized labor. Congressional Democrats who flock to the vacuous "center" of a rightward-creeping agenda lack the courage of any strong conviction. 
Yet strong conviction is exactly what's needed. Three million more Americans voted for Al Gore or Ralph Nader than voted for George W. Bush. Most Americans don't want a giant tax cut for the rich. They'd prefer health care, good schools and quality child care for all; stronger Social Security; and a tax cut mostly for men and women of modest means.
They don't want a giant missile defense against the world; they'd rather join the world in slowing global warming and reducing global poverty.
A third party won't get there. (Nader was a disaster.) But neither will the poll-driven, money-grubbing Democratic establishment in Washington. Reviving the Democratic Party will require rebuilding a party rooted in our communities and fiercely opposed to what the Republicans are pushing. In short, a political movement that inspires Democrats to be the party of the people who have been left out.

Kevin Phillips, author of "The Cousins' Wars: Religion, Politics, and the Triumph of Anglo-America."
The tacky side of Bill Clinton outweighed his achievements last November, and the balance keeps worsening. Quiet but serious Democratic exorcism is in order. Ralph Nader was right about the Democratic Party losing its soul to big donors and corporate money. The party needs to reclaim the legacy of Jefferson, Jackson, Franklin Roosevelt and Truman.
The two Democratic presidential nominees to lose to the Bushes -- Michael Dukakis and Albert Gore -- were both centrist, technocratic policy wonks with Harvard degrees. Enough said.
The most important Clinton legacy may be 1993-2000 as a prosperity period between two Bush recessions. No other legacy is more important to burnish. Historically, the G.O.P.'s vulnerability comes when a major economic downturn and the bursting of a speculative bubble catch the party in top-one-percent partying mode -- for example, upper-bracket tax cuts, glorying in globalization, fat-cat fund-raising. The near future could prove to be such a period of vulnerability. On top of which, our first-ever Restoration -- the quirky, risky selection of the previous Republican president's eldest son to establish the dynasty -- doubles the stakes of a G.O.P. failure.

Maynard Jackson, national development chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
Our party must distance itself from tabloid politics and focus on the business of working to restore the grass roots of our party. Although former President Clinton is beleaguered right now, we Democrats cannot abandon the leader who brought us America's greatest economic expansion. Now we must concentrate our energy and efforts on the people in the precincts. Democrats have a proud tradition of people politics.
Our Democratic Party is not an end; it is a means to an end. The end is a greater America -- where individual worth is valued and no person is left out; where every vote counts; and where "inclusion" is not a catchword, but is a passion. That must be our preoccupation, and that is our action plan.

Geraldine Ferraro, former congresswoman from New York and 1984 Democratic vice-presidential nominee.
The party should lie low and let the raging pardon fire burn itself out, as it inevitably will. When all is said and done, Bill Clinton will rise from the ashes and still be able to help Democrats running for office to raise money and get elected. Because of this amazing talent of his, his positive impact on the Congressional and Senate races in 2004 could be profound.
But it's quite another thing for Hillary. She worked hard for 18 months to win the Senate seat from New York with very little help from her husband, and voters responded to her agenda. She leads a separate and independent political life from her husband. She's done the Washington press conference, which was necessary to respond to the revelations about her brother. Now she should go back to the voters around the state and start telling them what she's doing in the Senate to deliver on her promises. Only by successfully changing the subject will the senator be able to move on and be her own woman.

Al From, founder and chief executive of the Democratic Leadership Council.
For most ordinary Americans, the last eight years meant better jobs and higher incomes, more opportunities and less inflation, more work and less welfare, safer neighborhoods and better schools. As long as Democrats stick to the New Democrat formula that produced that progress -- furthering our party's first principles by modern means to tackle America's new challenges -- we'll retain the confidence of the American people.
We must honor Andrew Jackson's credo of opportunity for all by spurring economic growth. That means fiscal discipline, paying down the debt, expanding trade, and investing in education and new technologies. We must honor John Kennedy's ethic of civic responsibility by expanding AmeriCorps. And we honor Franklin Roosevelt's legacy of innovation by modernizing Social Security and Medicare for new circumstances and by expanding programs that empower citizens, like charter schools and community policing.
So long as we keep our attention focused on solving the real problems facing people in their daily lives, the politics will take care of itself.

Donna Brazile, 2000 campaign manager for Al Gore.
As a Democrat, I believe my party has a future -- a future built on Bill Clinton's successes and beyond his disappointments.
The immediate task is to renew the discussion that Al Gore began in the campaign: to fight for working families, protect and expand our prosperity and invest in improving education and cleaning up the environment. This discussion, which also included paying down the debt, support for a modest tax cut for the middle class and strengthening and saving Social Security and Medicare, was on the right issues and holds the right ingredients to put together another winning coalition in 2001, 2002 and beyond. 
So, it's time to let Bill Clinton go -- go on and live the rest of his life and allow a new generation of Democratic leaders to renew their fight on behalf of working families in America.

Jesse L. Jackson Jr., Democratic representative from Illinois.
The 2000 election revealed that Americans are united on goals but divided over means: they chafe at the constraints of a two-party system and the limiting philosophies of conservatism, moderation and liberalism. We need to reach beyond these constraints to achieve the goals of the people.
In 1948, Hubert Humphrey said it was time for the Democratic Party to rise above states' rights and fight for human rights. Humphrey's insight has validity for our own time. Both candidates, and both parties, campaigned on providing every American with a good education and health care -- to "leave no one behind." I believe public education and health care are human rights and should be codified as American rights in the form of Constitutional amendments. Fighting for these rights is a nonideological, nonprogrammatic and bipartisan way of uniting the American people, and both parties, around common goals.

Dale Bumpers, retired senator from Arkansas.
I well remember pundits predicting that the impeachment of President Clinton would wipe the Democrats out in 2000. The Democrats proceeded to win/lose (whichever you prefer) the White House and make significant gains in Congress.
The investigations of the Clinton pardons are important, but to suggest that President Bush will get his program through in a cakewalk because of this issue is a stretch.
The pardons have been soundly condemned by Democrats as well as Republicans, taking away party advantage. And it would be very surprising if the pardon story has a life long enough to distract the public three or four months from now.
My own prediction is that once President Bush's programs hit center court, they will meet the same strong resistance they would have met had no pardons ever been granted. I know how strongly the Democratic Congressional leaders oppose them. More important, the American people always have a greater interest in matters that directly affect them, like income and estate taxes, education and medical care, than in a repeatedly hyped story on television. Democrats need to argue now that for the first time in our history, we are on the threshold of a golden age where affluence makes it possible to attack problems with solutions once thought unaffordable and to free our children of debt -- and that we must not fritter it away by adopting huge tax cuts. If Congress doesn't seize this opportunity, it won't be because the Democrats didn't make the case.

Warren Beatty, movie actor and director.
The Democratic Party has abdicated much of its soul to raise the money necessary to be elected. To regain its historic mission and activate its natural constituencies, the party must, above all, face the fact of its own culpability in the odor of the legalized bribery that constitutes the way we finance our campaigns. Why bemoan the Bush restoration if fund-raising has turned the Democrats into slightly kinder and gentler Republicans?
The present discussion of bribery should focus less on detecting those we feel might be culprits under the letter of the law and more on favorable treatment exchanged for campaign contributions that now technically qualify as legal.
Blackstone, in his "Commentaries," says: "Plato therefore more wisely, in his ideal Republic, orders those who take presents for doing their duty to be punished in the severest manner; and by the laws of Athens he that offered was also prosecuted as well as he that received a bribe."
How do we encourage honorable people to enter or remain in a profession in which success is so often achieved by dishonorable conduct? I hope the revelations of the last few days will dramatize for the public the dire necessity of having, and the high cost of not having, public financing of political campaigns.

Nita M. Lowey, a congresswoman from New York and chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Democrats can best move beyond this moment by drawing clear contrasts with Republicans on the issues. We must argue for a responsible budget that pays down the debt, provides a sensible tax cut for working families, and reflects our values. Over the past eight years, Democrats have been justly defined as the true party of fiscal responsibility and sound economic policy, and the American people acknowledged this last November when we gained seats in Congress and Al Gore won a plurality in the race for president. The challenge Democrats face is whether we can continue to articulate an agenda that keeps America on the path of economic prosperity by investing in our key priorities -- education and health care.

Mario Cuomo, former governor of New York.
The tsunami of media coverage unleashed by the Clinton pardons will be spent only when the current investigations conclude there is no provable criminal conduct. And that is likely. The suspicious conjunction of quid and quo -- gifts or contributions to politicians and decisions by politicians that favor the givers -- is an everyday occurrence in Washington and state politics, but rarely does it produce investigations, and even more rarely, convictions.
This week President Bush will describe his program for America. Its most important piece will be a tax cut mostly for wealthy Americans that is dangerously large and will leave us inadequate resources to deal with our education, health care and debt problems.
Distracted Democrats have already ceded much of the argument and are quibbling over the amount of the tax cut and who should benefit. As a result, they are in a precarious political position.
If they give the president a clear victory in the tax cut debate, they may forfeit any real chance to win either house of Congress in 2002. What a sad mishandling of the political situation that would be. Al Gore received half a million votes more than Mr. Bush -- a statement of preference for the Democratic agenda.
The Democrats have 50 votes in the Senate and are only nine votes from parity in the House. Theyshould forge a powerful alliance, supporting only a much smaller tax cut, one that benefits the working poor and middle class, and stay with their position until hell or the Republicans freeze over.

HEADLINE: A Quick Tax Cut 

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 A most important point is missing from the tax-cut debate (editorial, Feb. 20): the need for a very fast, temporary tax cut right now to prevent recession. The permanent tax cut can come later. This tax cut should be simple, to get it passed in a hurry -- a proportionate tax cut across the board or, better yet, a temporary proportionate cut in Social Security taxes. Failure to act swiftly would put the onus of a recession on an uncomprehending, phlegmatic Congress.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Brazilian Company Is Hacking Its Way Up

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER L. RICH 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
The first time Rinaldo Ribeiro hacked into the computer, he did it in less than three minutes.
 Vendors from the largest information security companies in the world had rigged the system, a Windows NT server, to try to keep him out, but that did not faze him. Nor did the several dozen people who were watching his every move on a large overhead video screen. What bothered him was that it had been too easy. 
 "I talked to the guy in charge afterwards to ask if they had left the flaw in on purpose because it was really simple and quick," said Mr. Ribeiro, whose boyish grin makes him look younger than his 26 years. 
Mr. Ribeiro is a professional hacker with Modulo Security Solutions, an information security firm here. He broke into the system in New Orleans 16 months ago while attending a conference sponsored by the Sans Institute, a leading research center for the security world. Each year, the institute challenges industry professionals from around the world to try and hack into a secure Internet server.
Of the 40 or so people who tried to beat the computer in New Orleans, only Mr. Ribeiro and two others succeeded. When Mr. Ribeiro defended his title last March at a conference in Orlando, he was the only one. That time, it took him eight minutes. He plans to defend his title again in May, at a conference in Baltimore.
"He seems like he really knows his stuff," said Christopher Pettit, a senior security officer at the Computer Sciences Corporation and a designer of the Sans Institute's challenge. "I would tend to hire a company like his because I know I would have somebody who understands what is going on."
That is exactly what Modulo is counting on. The company, with employees like Mr. Ribeiro, and with a second round of venture capital financing expected to close any day, is a market leader for information security in Brazil, serving clients here like Microsoft and ABN Amro. Having acquired five smaller security companies the last year, Modulo is setting off to conquer new markets elsewhere in Latin America and in the United States. Its goal is to become one of the largest security companies in the world. 
Modulo, with revenues of $13.6 million last year, is housed in a nondescript office building in downtown Rio, and it still has a long way to go to catch up with current leaders. The major consulting firms, like KPMG, provide security services, as do big software vendors like Oracle. But analysts say that the market is ripe for new contenders.
"There are so many mom-and-pop information security companies out there, like the software industry 25 years ago," said Darren Lacey, managing director of the Information Security Institute at Johns Hopkins. "If you are good at it and you can get a few flagship customers, you are a player."
Though technology companies are suffering, the information security industry is booming, thanks in part to a growing number of high-profile attacks. Last month, for instance, vandals broke into the computer system of the economic summit in Davos, Switzerland, and downloaded files filled with personal information on the participants.
With companies scrambling to protect their privileged information, the worldwide market for security services is projected to grow to $17.2 billion in 2004 from $5.5 billion in 1999, according to the International Data Corporation, a market research firm. The United States is expected to account for nearly half that spending. 
Modulo was founded in 1985 by 13 students at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, home to one of only two mainframe computers in the country at the time. With computers only trickling into the protected Brazilian market, the partners recognized the potential security risks in allowing a number of people to share the same computer, and they set about developing software that would limit each user's access.
As Brazilian banks started automating, they became Modulo's first big clients, and the company's security services grew along with its clients' needs. 
By 1993, the company had developed a patented method, called security analysis and certification, to evaluate a company's security risks -- a process that involved everything from debriefing employees to staging hacker attacks. 
"We find all of the vulnerabilities that a company might have -- networks, laptops, palmtops and especially personnel," said Jaime Araujo, vice president for marketing and business development at Modulo. "We had a client once who had information stolen because a competing company hired away the driver of the C.E.O.'s car." 
The next year, Modulo got its big break, winning a contract from the Brazilian government to secure a nationwide project to computerize voting. In last year's municipal elections, Modulo trained 2,000 poll workers and provided security for more than 13,000 electronic voting machines throughout the country. The company also won a federal contract in 1997 to provide security for income tax filing over the Internet. Last year, 11 million Brazilians filed tax returns electronically. 
But according to Mr. Araujo, the fortunes of the company really changed when the partners decided to enter a business plan contest sponsored by the Brazilian government in 1997.
During a trip to a trade show in San Francisco a couple of months earlier, the partners met with venture capitalists at Hambrecht & Quist, who, despite declining to invest in the company, allowed them to take home a handful of business plans from successful start-ups like Amazon and Real Networks. 
"None of us slept the whole way home on the plane devouring those plans," he said. "We were miles away from having a business plan like those." 
Using the plans as guides, Modulo eventually won the government contest's $350,000 first prize from among hundreds of competitors, providing the seed capital for the company's international expansion. It also provided a structure for the company's growth. 
"Without a doubt, it was the culture of the business plan that allowed us to triple our revenues every year for the last four years," Mr. Araujo said. 
In 1999, Modulo opened a small office in the Silicon Valley city of San Rafael, Calif. Rather than tackling the entire security market, the company decided to concentrate on its strongest area of expertise -- electronic elections. Modulo set up a company called SafeVote, and in January 2000, it was invited to the White House to address an electronic commerce working group led by Vice President Al Gore's staff on computerizing voting. 
At the time of the presidential elections last November, SafeVote ran its first live test in the United States, organizing a mock election with several hundred voters in Contra Costa, Calif., under a contract with the California secretary of state. Although the company published the specifications of the system and invited hackers to try to disrupt voting, SafeVote said the test went off without a hitch. The company is hoping that, after the Florida ballot debacle, the new interest in updated voting systems in the United States will provide a market opportunity. 
At the same time, Modulo wants to branch out in the United States to offer a full range of security services. Because hundreds of security companies already operate in the United States, though, analysts say that competition in the American market will be stiff for Modulo. To create a foothold, the company said it had decided to use its newest round of financing to buy at least two security companies in the United States. It declined to identify them, other than to say that one is in New York. 
"There is still space in the market for people who know what they are doing," said Mr. Pettit of Computer Sciences. "What's going to happen is that there is going to be a shakeout because of lack of talent." 
As part of the company's Latin American expansion plans, Modulo is also in talks to buy companies in Argentina, Chile and Mexico. It has also created a Web portal, Modulo.com.br, and is selling training courses over the Internet. 
Mr. Araujo has found that the hardest thing to overcome in the United States market is the bias that he said American companies had against Brazil. Unlike Israel or Japan, he said, Brazil is not known for being technologically strong. To go around the problem, he said that the company had hired an American financial adviser to do most of its negotiating for acquisitions. 
And then, of course, there will be the inevitable culture clash.
"While a Brazilian spends a half an hour talking about a problem over a coffee," he said, "an American will discuss it in two minutes and want an answer in the third."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
How Agencies Read Signs of a Slowdown

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
As Madison Avenue anxiously watches the faltering performance of the national economy for signs of a recession, executives have been keeping their eyes on the calendar as well as the clock.
 Why? This year marks the 10th anniversary of the last recession, which inflicted significant damage on agencies as advertising spending fell for the first time in 30 years. Industry leaders fear that history could repeat itself if the current slowdown in ad spending spirals into an actual decline. 
 But a Rip or Dame van Winkle who went to sleep a decade ago would probably be totally disoriented if he or she were to awaken now and try to use the lessons of the last recession to navigate through the current uncertainties. That's because the ways that the advertising, marketing and media industries operate have undergone significant changes since 1991 -- some for the better, others perhaps not. 
What that means for managers today is that they will need to decide how to solve problems using very different tactics from those that may have worked before and, of course, make those decisions far faster than they had to be made 10 years ago before ubiquitous e-mail and express-mail deliveries by 8 a.m.
Among the most noticeable differences: fewer but larger advertising agencies with fewer staff members devoted to each assignment; fewer but larger marketers, many spending freely in industries that were minuscule or nonexistent a decade ago; more emphasis on pleasing existing customers than hunting for new ones; a more diverse and fractionated consumer population; and a more diverse and fractionated media universe to reach those consumers.
"The megachanges in our business have all occurred in the last five or six years," said Brendan Ryan, chairman and chief executive at FCB Worldwide in New York, the global advertising agency owned by True North Communications that works for marketing behemoths like AT&T, Compaq Computer, J. P. Morgan Chase, Merck and Samsung.
One major change is "the degree to which we have to hire people with specialized depth of expertise," Mr. Ryan said, "in industries like information technology, telecommunications, financial services and drugs." Such industries, he said, are far more important to Madison Avenue now because they spend far more now to advertise than they did in the past. 
Drug makers, for example, spent $2.1 billion last year to advertise prescription products directly to consumers, an avenue not even open to them a decade ago.
"In the past, the skill sets were much more readily transferable, and you could more easily move from one packaged-goods account to another," Mr. Ryan said. "Now, you just can't walk on to a Compaq and know it, or move on from Compaq to Merck or Chase."
That is true not only in terms of the complexity of client tasks but in terms of the services the agencies provide. In 1991, traditional advertising, which is aimed mostly at wooing potential customers, was mainstream agencies' stock in trade. Other offerings -- like direct marketing, interactive advertising, consulting, corporate identity, public relations, sales promotion and sports marketing -- were played down as the province of smaller, specialty shops.
A decade later, agencies that have failed to diversify into services outside the realm of traditional advertising risk losing out to more broadly based competitors. Such services now account on average for 50 percent or more of revenue for the industry leaders, two to four times the portion as the 1990's began.
And a waking van Winkle would be startled by the growing portion of the work that agencies produce nowadays that is intended to help nurture the relationships between marketers and current customers rather than to lure would-be customers to switching brands. 
This new emphasis in customer coddling could make advertising more recession-proof than in the past because it is a type of spending that is less likely to be cut in lean seasons.
"Marketers today are much more conscious of needing to build and maintain those brand relationships than they were in the early 90's," said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive at the American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York, the trade organization.
"After the last recession, we collected a body of evidence showing that it's not very smart to cut your advertising and marketing budgets," he added, because companies that maintain or even increase spending in bad times rebound faster and higher once good times return.
"Even if spending cutbacks happen," Mr. Drake said, "agencies are in a much better position to weather whatever storms come" than when the recession hit a decade ago. That downturn came after a period of profligacy marked by what turned out in retrospect to be costly overexpansion in hiring and office space -- not unlike the bender Wall Street went on before the stock market crash of 1987.
Now, Mr. Drake said, "guys like John Wren, John Dooner and Martin Sorrell keep a tight rein on expenses, particularly in real estate." His reference was to the chief executives of the three largest agency companies: in order, the Omnicom Group, the Interpublic Group of Companies and the WPP Group.
Because of consolidation in the last decade, those giants now control a much larger share of the industry's revenue and billings than in the last recession. That's another eye-opening change for the van Winkles.
"Many of the senior executives who did manage their way through" the recession a decade ago "have collected handsomely from the mergers and buyouts" that consolidated the ranks of agencies, said Gary Burandt, executive director at the International Communications Agency Network in Rollinsville, Colo., a network of independent local and regional shops.
"There are not a lot of people around in the advertising business who remember the last hard downturn," he added. "The ones that are were so junior then that they didn't have to worry about the agency's balance sheet."
Of the agencies that remain, they "are not as fat as before," Mr. Burandt said, "and there is more productivity thanks to the rapid application of technology." In other words, he said: "Fewer heads and more computers."
Along with those additional computers are additional media choices for agencies when they determine where to spend their clients' dollars.
"More TV channels, more radio stations, more titles on the newsstands," Mr. Burandt said. "And there is the Internet." Indeed, that is an entirely new consumer medium -- with powerful effects on all the others -- that only a clairvoyant van Winkle could have imagined in 1991.
And fewer of those media introduced in the last decade are aimed at mass markets, seeking instead to focus narrowly on niche or specialty readers or viewers. That reflects a desire to capitalize on the variegated changes in the last decade in the American consumer population. 
There are now more two-income households, and many more of them without children. There are more black households and households with residents of Asian ancestry as well as more households where Spanish is spoken, many with more children than the average family. There are more households where men or women identify themselves as gay or lesbian. There are more households in faster-growing Sun Belt states. 
And the media -- whether over the air, via cable, on the Web or in print -- are aiming at all of these narrower demographic segments.
"We have so many more titles that are targeted to special interests, who are more passionate audiences," said Nina B. Link, president and chief executive at the Magazine Publishers of America in New York, the industry trade association.
"For the advertiser, it's more of a direct connection, because these readers really want their magazines," she added. "As a medium, that will help us come through whatever softening there is because we have stronger assets than in '91."
Operationally, magazines now offer advertisers opportunities they could not in the last recession, particularly what is called a faster close -- that is, later deadlines for submitting ads before publication, made possible by the greater computerization of publishing.
"That's a big benefit to advertisers in these times," said Ellen Oppenheim, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the magazine association, "because dollars are often released later" as plans change because of changing economic conditions "and you may need to be more fleet with the content of your ads."
For instance, an auto maker can switch the model to be peddled in a print ad to a faster seller from a slower seller or add details about a new rebate meant to counter a sudden sales slump.
If the van Winkles were to ask what the main difference is between 2001 and 1991, the answer wouldmost likely be that "there is now a greater belief in the power of advertising" among top marketers, said Nancy L. Salz, president at Nancy L. Salz Consulting in New York, which sponsors training seminars in agency relations and advertising development.
Believing that "advertising is even more important to their sales" than they perceived it to be a decade ago means "budgets might be more stable," she added, and therefore "the relationships between advertisers and agencies would weather a recession better."

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
Corporate credit managers have long warned about Internet companies' shaky math. Now, people are listening.

BYLINE:  By Gretchen Morgenson 

 BODY:
STOCK analysts like Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch still wax enthusiastic about the prospects for many of the troubled Web companies they follow. But with the capital markets closed to cash-short Internet companies, bullish analysts no longer hold the key to a company's ability to raise money.
 The control of the cash drawer has shifted to corporate credit managers, the decidedly less prominent people at companies that sell products to retailers and other concerns. 
 They decide how much credit to extend to their corporate customers and under what circumstances. And they are much tougher in their analyses of companies' financial strengths or weaknesses than most of Wall Street has been. 
"For valuations of Internet companies, people talked about earnings, and when they didn't have earnings, they talked about sales," said Gary W. Emery, a professor of finance at the University of Oklahoma's Price College of Business, who specializes in analyzing credit risk.
"But when it comes down to short-term survival," he said, "sales and earnings are not all that impressive to a vendor. They want to know if there's cash flow there."
Every day, it seems, another couple of Internet companies fail. So it is perhaps not surprising that corporate credit managers are scrutinizing the financial standing of Web companies much more closely and demanding more security from them before handing over merchandise on credit.
No "new economy" metrics like revenue growth or numbers of visits to a Web site will satisfy these hard-nosed managers. They prefer quaint measures like a company's working capital levels.
Lyle Wallis is vice president for research at the Credit Research Foundation, an organization in Columbia, Md., that studies the management of credit among businesses. He said that credit managers were approaching even their biggest Internet customers with great skepticism. 
"There has been a fair amount of doubt in the minds of credit people right along as the Internet mania evolved," Mr. Wallis said.
"The problem. he added, "is management within these companies saw the potential for increased revenue and put a tremendous amount of pressure on the credit person to ship. So the credit person was doing so on blind faith."
Now, the days of blind-faith shipping are over, Mr. Wallis said. Vendors are curtailing shipments and limiting their financial risk by demanding complete or partial security from their customers.
Some suppliers, for example, are demanding that their Internet customers sign notes stating that the goods delivered to them serve as collateral for the transaction. That way, if the dot-com becomes bankrupt, the creditor will have a slightly better standing among those who are owed money. 
In addition, Mr. Wallis said, some vendors might supply goods to a dot-com only on consignment, with the vendor retaining ownership of the goods until they are bought and paid for by a third party. 
Vendors worry about Internet companies' lack of tangible assets.
For example, the primary assets of most dot-coms are their customer lists. But investors in bankrupt dot-coms are finding to their dismay that, unlike the lists owned by catalog companies, Internet concerns' customer rosters often have no resale value. That is because most privacy agreements stipulate that consumers are providing the information to the Internet company for its use only. 
"Other assets may be technology related to the site and the Web site itself," Mr. Wallis said. "But dot-coms are very shallow where assets are concerned, so it is hard to figure out whether there is any equity in the business."
Paradoxically, the lack of hard assets, once viewed as a benefit to Web companies because it would allow them to be more nimble and profitable, is now a decidedly negative attribute.
Beleaguered investors in these stocks must now consider how credit managers might deal with their Internet customers. Ravi Suria, a convertible bond analyst at Lehman Brothers, was the first to raise the issue on Feb. 6 when he published a report predicting that Amazon.com would face a creditor squeeze later this year. Mr. Suria based his assessment on the fact that Amazon's working capital -- defined as its near-term assets minus its short-term liabilities -- would turn negative later this year. If that happened, Mr. Suria wrote, the companies whose goods Amazon sells on its site would cut back on the credit they extend to Amazon, causing a squeeze.
When the report came out, Amazon spokesmen called it "silly and chock full of errors." But last week, The Washington Post, citing unidentified sources, reported that certain suppliers to Amazon.com were growing concerned about the company's finances. Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company's chairman, was quoted in the article saying that Amazon had never been in better shape.
Trying to dispel the gloom that Mr. Suria's analysis created, Mr. Blodget of Merrill Lynch issued a report about Amazon.com on Feb. 12, arguing that he did not believe that vendors would be concerned if Amazon's working capital fell into negative territory. After the Post article appeared, Mr. Blodget said that he remained comfortable with Amazon's liquidity.
The difference of opinion between the analysts strikes at the heart of whether Internet companies are still operating, as they did during the mania for their stocks, under a more forgiving set of financial standards. And it is the subject of a meeting on Wednesday in New York sponsored by the New York Society of Securities Analysts. The forum, Amazon.com: Responsibility for Investment Information, will feature investors and analysts discussing this question: How will the real-world credit managers employed by Amazon's suppliers make the decisions that count? A representative from Amazon has been invited to the meeting. The company did not return a phone call inquiring whether it would send someone.
The forum will be conducted by the society's committee for corporate governance and shareholder rights, whose chairman is Peter F. Brennan, co-founder of MidCap Investors; Gary Lutin, an investment banker at Lutin & Company in New York, is the co-sponsor. 
"The world economy has been going through changes which will probably prove to be much greater than those of the Industrial Revolution," Mr. Lutin said. "Nobody's really sure what old rules still work and what new rules might apply. And that makes it harder to distinguish fantasy from reality." 
Reality has already set in where Internet stocks are concerned, of course. But with vendors making crucial credit decisions about the Internet companies they supply goods to, a bigger dose of reality will very likely set in fast.
Mr. Wallis of the Credit Research Foundation said that during the mania for Internet stocks, credit managers felt perplexed: "They were sitting there scratching their heads saying, 'What are we missing? Obviously the investment community sees something we don't see that makes it viable to take a risk.' But we never really came to an answer."
The answer has now become clearer. What investors were seeing in Internet companies was never really there at all.

As Income Climbs for Rich, Share Paid in Taxes Falls
The income gains of the richest Americans are far outstripping those of everyone else, yet the share of their incomes that they pay in taxes is declining, according to data that the Internal Revenue Service gave a Republican member of Congress.
 The 1998 incomes of the top 1 percent of taxpayers increased at more than three times the rate of the bottom 90 percent, according to an analysis of this data by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Over a longer period, from 1989 to 1998, the incomes of the richest 1 percent, adjusted for inflation, grew about eight times as fast. But the share of their income they paid in federal taxes in 1998 was at its lowest level since 1992. Page C2.

HEADLINE: Wealthiest Pay Declining Share of TheirIncomes in Taxes 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The richest Americans are paying a declining share of their incomes in taxes, even as their incomes grow more rapidly than everyone else's, according to data that the Internal Revenue Service gave a Republican member of Congress.
 The 1998 incomes, after taxes, of the top 1 percent of taxpayers increased at more than three times the rate of the bottom 90 percent, according to an analysis of this data by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit research organization in Washington that seeks to advance the interests of the poor. 
 Over a longer period, from 1989 to 1998, the incomes of the richest 1 percent, adjusted for inflation, grew about eight times as fast. But the share of their income they paid in federal taxes in 1998 was at its lowest level since 1992, the year before Congress added two higher tax brackets that apply only to top earners. 
This group, whose 1998 gross income averaged $816,189, paid 27.1 cents of each dollar earned in federal income taxes, down from 27.9 cents in 1997 and 28.9 cents in 1996.
These figures come from data the I.R.S. gave to Representative Jim Saxton, a New Jersey Republican and chairman of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee.
For the other 99 percent of Americans, the share of income going to taxes was nearly unchanged, at 11.5 percent of income in 1998 and 1996 and 11.7 percent in 1997.
Christopher Frenze, the committee executive director, said the declining average tax rate for the top 1 percent reflected the booming stock market, and the reduction in long-term capital gains tax rates that began in 1997. The top rate is now 20 percent, down from 28 percent in 1996.
About a third of all long-term capital gains taxes are paid by fewer than 13,000 taxpayers each year.
With data available only through 1998, it was unclear whether the income gains and tax savings for the wealthy have continued during the stock market's recent retreat.
Opponents of President Bush's proposed $1.6 trillion tax cut say that most of the breaks would go to the rich. Mr. Bush has said that the benefits would be widely distributed.
In a report to be issued today, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that Mr. Bush's plan will further increase the share of after-tax income going to the wealthy. That is because the top 1 percent would get 40 percent of the tax breaks, more than their 18.5 percent share of income taxes paid.
"It is extremely interesting that the largest income gains were among the portion of the population whose marginal tax rates were raised in the 1990's," said Isaac Shapiro, a policy analyst at the center. "This suggests that higher marginal tax rates have not been a barrier to economic activity and risk-taking activity within this group."
Backers of Mr. Bush's plan say that high marginal tax rates reduce wealth creation by discouraging investment, an effect that has serious long-term economic consequences.
The center's analysis showed that the top 1 percent of taxpayers had an average after-tax income of $594,814 in 1998, up $69,000, or 13.1 percent, over 1997. The bottom 90 percent -- everyone who made less than $83,220 in 1998 -- saw their average income rise by $984 from 1997, just 3.9 percent.
From 1989 to 1998 the incomes of the top 1 percent, adjusted for inflation, grew by 40.4 percent, nearly eight times the 5.2 percent increase of the bottom 90 percent.
As a result, the top 1 percent earned 15.7 cents of every dollar of personal income in 1998, up from 14.7 cents in 1997 and 12.5 cents in 1989, the I.R.S. data show. Those near the top -- on the 90th through 99th rungs of the income ladder -- saw their incomes rise at less than half the rate of the top 1 percent from 1989 through 1998, yet their tax burden increased by a percentage point.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Monday about the declining share of income paid in taxes by the wealthiest Americans misstated the share of all federal income taxes paid by the top 1 percent of taxpayers in 1998. It was 34.75 percent; 18.5 percent was their share of total individual income.

HEADLINE: In India and Africa, Women's Low Status Worsens Their Risk of AIDS 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
The poverty and powerlessness of women in Africa and Asia are combining to make them increasingly vulnerable to AIDS, which some research groups are now calling a women's disease. 
 Despite years of international conferences and declarations about women's rights, in many cultures and in the most disadvantaged societies girls and women do not have the power to reject unwanted or unsafe sex. 
 A lack of individual power, or even basic human rights, has already condemned many women to death in Africa, where more than half the people affected by AIDS are women, according to United Nations reports. 
As the epidemic grows in Asia -- particularly in South Asia, where by virtually every international measure women have the lowest status in the world -- the results are expected to be catastrophic. 
A report last week from Secretary General Kofi Annan concluded, "The gender dynamics of the epidemic are far-reaching due to women's weaker ability to negotiate safe sex, and their generally lower social and economic status." 
The report will be taken up on Monday at a meeting to prepare for a special General Assembly session in June devoted to AIDS. As that session approaches, women's groups are increasing their efforts to get attention for women's vulnerability, which occupies only one paragraph in the secretary general's 29-page report. 
The issue rekindles debates about women's rights in personal relationships, including whether they are able to insist on the use of condoms, an issue that dominated the 1994 United Nations population conference in Cairo and the international conference on women the following year in Beijing. 
"We are working extremely hard to save five years of gains," said Adrienne Germain, president of the International Women's Health Coalition in New York, which assists groups in the developing world.
At Unifem, the United Nations development program for women, Stephanie Urdang, the adviser on sex and the virus that causes AIDS, said the voices of women in the third world are clear on this issue: women there cite property laws and cultural practices among the obstacles to protecting themselves against the disease, which is particularly ravaging sub-Saharan Africa. 
"For example," Ms. Urdang said, "there is the belief in Africa and Asia that if a man sleeps with a virgin, he'll be cured." 
She also noted the practice in which a widow is married off to her deceased husband's brother. "Of course," she said, "in many cases the husband will have died of H.I.V.-AIDS, and she might be infected and will infect his brother."
Ms. Urdang continued: "Another practice that is very, very devastating is that women do not have land rights and property rights in most of sub-Saharan Africa, which means they are allocated a plot of land to work on in order to produce food for the family. 
"But if the husband dies, they have no right to that land anymore, or even the house that the husband would have built for them. It's taken over by the husband's family, which is within customary law, and then they are left destitute. 
"And if he's died of AIDS, what regularly happens is that the first person to be diagnosed in the family is the pregnant wife, because she'll go to a clinic and will be tested. Then she'll be looked at as the cause of the disease." 
Noeleen Heyzer, executive director of Unifem, argues that to combat AIDS, governments and international agencies will have to focus on the particular needs of women, who are often denied medicines. 
"We've talked for so long about the need to really look at gender in all aspects of development work," Ms. Urdang said. "With H.I.V.-AIDS, it is so much clearer because it is an issue of life and death." 
"When you look at why this is happening," she added, "it's so much the cultural practices and values and beliefs that underlie our societies that discriminate against women." 
Ms. Germain, who formerly directed programs in Bangladesh for the Ford Foundation, said women's groups there and in India and Nepal were raising similar warnings about the folly of ignoring social attitudes. She said that in South Asia, the disease was spread in somewhat different ways. 
In India, for example, "there is quite a bit of unrecognized homosexuality, especially early among men, who then marry later, with their wives not having any idea that they had earlier relationships" that might have involved risky sex. 
She added that women in India are often totally uninformed about sex when they are married, that the marriages are often to older men and arranged by their families. Women are then under great pressure to produce sons, and the use of contraceptives, specifically condoms, is out of the question. 
And across Asia, Ms. Germain continued, "you have intravenous drug use, which in itself is a very important part of the picture, but can also lead into sexual prostitution and trafficking." Migrant labor, long-haul trucking, rail networks and the military all move infections around India, she said. 
In most of South Asia, illiteracy among women is the highest anywhere, and there are few health centers attentive to the needs of women in rural areas. 
The American Foundation for AIDS Research (Amfar) reported recently that as many as 30 million Indians could be infected by 2010. 
Prostitutes in Asia, some of them now organized in self-help organizations, have long complained that their customers refuse to use condoms, which in any case are not always available. This month the government of Vietnam said it had found that 20 percent of prostitutes it had studied were H.I.V.-positive. 
"In India," Ms. Germain said, "the low status of women, the economic dependence, the marriage patterns, all of these factors are going to mean that women are much less likely than even women in Africa to be able to negotiate condom use or to have any say at all about when sex occurs. Much more needs to be understood about the relationship between women's status and the epidemic."
Family-planning programs in India have played down the use of condoms, though a new government program for fighting AIDS is now trying to make them more accessible, Ms. Germain said. "We need to work with young people and get to both girls and boys early," she said, "and not in just the conventional sex education mode." 
She recommended more education in sexual behavior that "emphasizes gender equality and power relations and sexuality more broadly, not just biologically." 
"But there are a lot of taboos against doing that," she said. "The need to get information to young people is critical. But the political will doesn't yet exist."

HEADLINE: School Privatization Foes Say Chosen Company Unfairly Gets Board's Help With Vote 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT and ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Opponents of a plan by Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy to let a private company manage five low-performing public schools are accusing the Board of Education of unfairly skewing the process because the private company, Edison Schools Inc., is being given board resources to try to persuade parents to support the plan. 
 The privatization plan was first promoted by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. In December, Chancellor Levy announced that he had selected Edison, which manages more than 100 public schools in 45 cities, to convert three schools in Brooklyn, one in Manhattan and one in the Bronx to charter schools, which would free them from many state and local regulations and allow Edison to use its own curriculum and teaching methods. 
 But to convert a school to charter status, Edison has to get parents of more than 50 percent of the schoolchildren to vote for the process -- no easy feat in a city where barely 5 percent of the electorate typically turns out for a school board election. If, for example, only 49 percent of a school's parents cast ballots, Edison loses, even if all those voting cast their ballots for Edison. 
Shortly after Mr. Levy announced Edison's selection in December, opponents began complaining that parents were not being given enough information about how the vote would be conducted, about the company and about the instructional and management methods it planned to use. Edison, whose stock is traded on the Nasdaq market, aims to earn a profit eventually from managing the schools.
Once Edison started to meet with parents and community groups, opponents complained that the company had an unfair advantage because only Edison, and not opponents, was given the names and addresses of parents at the schools.
Yesterday, Mr. Levy said the Board of Education would pay to print and mail material opposing Edison to be produced by the New York chapter of Acorn, an education reform group. While the group intends to take Mr. Levy up on the offer of three mailings, its executive director, Bertha Lewis, said Acorn still intended to file a lawsuit against the Board of Education this week to halt the election process. The vote is to take place March 12 to March 23.
So far, the opponents have been largely successful in defining the battle in terms of community control of local schools; Ms. Lewis and several other opponents have likened their effort to the divisive school decentralization battles of the late 1960's.
"People still harken back to the Ocean Hill-Brownsville days," Ms. Lewis said, referring to the Brooklyn school district that was at the center of the fights over community control of local schools. "The parents now feel they're being overlooked and not really considered" in the decision-making process. "In a very real way, the current debate shows a lack of accountability by the central board in this system."
There are differences, though, between the current debate and the school decentralization battles of the late 1960's, which often pitted ethnic groups against one another, as when Jewish teachers were protested by black parent groups. In the current battle, an anti-Edison group, the People's Coalition to Take Back Our Schools, includes both the Black Radical Congress and Jews for Economic and Racial Justice.
The current proposal also crosses different racial lines than did the debates of the 1960's. Three of the five schools -- Public School 161 in Harlem, Intermediate School 111 in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and Public School 66 in Crotona Park East, the Bronx -- have overwhelmingly Hispanic student bodies. The two other schools, Middle School 320 in Wingate and Middle School 246 in Flatbush, both in Brooklyn, have largely black student populations.
The current debate, though, is no less intense. At a meeting last Tuesday night between community groups and Edison officials at the headquarters of the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network in Harlem, Hazel Dukes of the New York State N.A.A.C.P. said Mr. Levy should "be put in a dungeon, and let us get on with the education of our children."
Irving S. Hamer Jr., the Manhattan representative on the Board of Education, who opposes the privatization initiative, said he thought it was "abominable" that Mr. Levy would choose schools whose students were mostly poor, black and Hispanic for the program. In a recent essay, Mr. Hamer drew parallels between this "privatization experiment on low-performing schools" and infamous projects like the Tuskegee experiment, in which poor black men with syphilis were recruited by federal health researchers and then left untreated. 
In an interview, Mr. Levy said he was not bothered by the strong rhetoric. "In any debate concerning public issues, there are people who stake out ideological points of view," he said. "In that give and take, the truth will come out."
Edison officials have tried to focus on their plans and avoid ideological questions like whether a for-profit company should be managing public schools. Last week, officials said Edison would give the five schools more resources than they now receive, like the home computers that every Edison student in third grade and above gets in the second year of its management.

HEADLINE: From Under a Couch, an Effort to Stop Ukraine Corruption 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
The security officer who released secret recordings made under the couch of the president of Ukraine -- which now receives more American aid than any post-Communist nation -- says he is on a one-man quest "to stop all the corruption and all the nastiness" that have followed the Soviet collapse.
 In his first meeting with a journalist since he went into hiding three months ago, Mikola Melnichenko, whose revelations have shaken the government of President Leonid D. Kuchma, said that when he finished transcribing hundreds of hours of tapes spirited out of Ukraine last fall, he will be able to trace virtually all high-level corruption, repression and some acts of violence to Mr. Kuchma. 
 If so, Mr. Melnichenko might become something of a hero across the ruins of the Soviet empire. Millions of impoverished people are embittered that instead of experiencing the promised market economy and democracy, their newly independent states fell under the sway of men -- many, like Mr. Kuchma, former Communist bosses -- who have attained enormous power and wealth at the expense of national prosperity. 
"My goal is to totally expose the level of corruption in Ukraine as an independent Don Quixote and ensure that thieves will never come to power again in Ukraine," Mr. Melnichenko said.
On Saturday, the 34-year-old Ukrainian arrived at a clandestine rendezvous in a Central European country wearing a pageboy wig and a heavy coat to disguise his identity. Six hours later, he left the same way, asking his guests to wait five minutes before leaving the inn 250 miles outside the capital of the country, which he asked not to be identified. 
He charged in a long interview that Mr. Kuchma had pocketed at least $1 billion for personal or political use, and that the full transcript of recordings made since at least 1998 in Mr. Kuchma's office would establish that "there is no greater criminal in Ukraine than Kuchma."
Mr. Kuchma at first denied that his voice was heard on Mr. Melnichenko's tapes, whose contents have caused a political crisis in Ukraine, the recipient of $2 billion of American aid since Mr. Kuchma, a former director of a Soviet-era missile factory, won the presidency in 1994. 
Ukraine's prosecutor later acknowledged that the voice heard was that of the president, but said Mr. Melnichenko had tampered with the recordings to distort their content.
Mr. Melnichenko praised the United States for its support of Ukraine and said American intelligence services had helped to support democracy there and to investigate corruption. But he said most of that evidence had simply been presented to Mr. Kuchma, who then took steps to cover up and protect the circle of oligarchs who finance his rule. 
"All of these people are working on Kuchma's orders," he said. "They laundered money on Kuchma's orders, and they divided it up."
He said Mr. Kuchma had established a "krisha," or roof, that protected oligarchs and businessmen who, he said, kicked back millions of dollars in cash to accounts controlled by Mr. Kuchma through his banker and confidant, Oleksandr Volkov, a powerful member of Parliament. "Everyone who works for us should pay money for his krisha," he quoted Mr. Kuchma as saying on the tapes. 
Mr. Melnichenko, who said he had attended a military academy in Ukraine and served in the Soviet Army, worked in Mr. Kuchma's presidential security detail for six years. Before that, as a K.G.B. bodyguard, he spent a year in the Kremlin serving the last Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
Today, Mr. Melnichenko describes Mr. Kuchma as a leader so all-powerful that he can call in prosecutors, tax officials and intelligence chiefs and order them to guarantee, for instance, a sizable margin of victory in the last presidential election in 1999, to open criminal investigations of political foes, or to "ruin" businessmen who support his opponents.
"What I find personally disgusting is that businesses that could have been successful and provided the people with jobs, Kuchma closed down for personal political reasons," Mr. Melnichenko said. "One of the greatest evils that Kuchma has done has been to turn the whole country into his private little racket."
In one case, he said the recordings showed that Mr. Kuchma was involved in discussions of how to orchestrate a grenade attack by government agents on an opposition candidate and hard-line populist, Natalya Vitrenko. He said he had "before and after" recordings of Mr. Kuchma discussing the attack on Oct. 2, which wounded Ms. Vitrenko and 33 others during a rally in the industrial city of Krivy Rih. 
Mr. Kuchma hoped to place blame for the attack on Oleksandr Moroz, the Socialist Party leader who was also considered a threat to Mr. Kuchma's election, Mr. Melnichenko said.
He refused to discuss whether other security officers collaborated in the recording, but he described an atmosphere of cynicism and treachery in Mr. Kuchma's inner circle, where his intelligence chiefs wiretapped one other and provided Mr. Kuchma with evidence that the others were engaged in corruption.
In hiding, Mr. Melnichenko says he is transcribing the audio record, but will not release more tapes until the recordings are judged authentic by independent experts. A panel assembled by the International Press Institute in Vienna, and supported by Freedom House in New York, is reviewing hundreds of recorded conversations that Mr. Melnichenko gave them last month.
Since he fled in late November, Mr. Melnichenko has twice been interviewed over the telephone by the American-financed Radio Liberty. He said he had routed his telephone calls through several phones to prevent being traced by Ukrainian security services, which have been trying to locate him and force his return to face criminal charges for illegally bugging Mr. Kuchma's office.
Mr. Melnichenko said that his legal status in the country where he is hiding expired on Tuesday and that he would like the United States or Britain to help protect his family while he completed his work.
Mr. Melnichenko expressed concern for the safety of his wife, Lilia, and their 4-year-old daughter, Lesya, who are with him in hiding. He said he was reluctant to request political asylum in the West for fear of being accused of being a Western agent.
When he left Ukraine, he said, he took only about $2,000 in savings, thinking he would be gone only a few weeks. He assumed that his initial disclosures about Mr. Kuchma's role in ordering the kidnapping of a journalist, Georgy Gongadze, who was later found dead, would have been enough to drive the president from office.
Mr. Gongadze disappeared in September. His headless body was found in early November outside Kiev, the Ukrainian capital. 
The journalist's disappearance shocked Mr. Melnichenko into listening to the recordings that he -- and perhaps others -- had been compiling. He came to the recordings on which Mr. Kuchma, he said, ordered his minister of interior, Yuri Kravchenko, to "get rid" of Mr. Gongadze, by orchestrating a kidnapping that could be attributed to "Chechens," whose republic has been notorious for its kidnapping trade.
Mr. Melnichenko said he was going to pass a note about what he knew to the outgoing and incoming American ambassadors to Ukraine, Steven Pifer and Carlos Pascual, when they visited Mr. Kuchma last fall. But there were too many onlookers, he said. (Mr. Pascual has since criticized the slow pace of the investigation into Mr. Gongadze's death; on Friday, Mr. Kuchma said Ukraine would accept F.B.I. forensic help.) 
Foiled, Mr. Melnichenko then passed a cassette to Mr. Moroz, the Socialist leader and former Parliament speaker. For his colleagues, Mr. Melnichenko developed a cover story of resigning for a private security job and going to London for training; he left just before Mr. Moroz on Nov. 28 played in Parliament the first recordings of Mr. Kuchma's demands to remove Mr. Gongadze.
"I really believed that when some of these things were made public, Kuchma would go," Mr. Melnichenko said, "I can't believe he is still around."
One of the most serious allegations of official corruption arises from a recording on which Mr. Kuchma discusses how to destroy records and cover up multimillion-dollar transactions through which Igor Bakai, the former head of Ukraine's energy monopoly, reportedly stole $30 million in natural gas revenues. 
Mr. Bakai was forced out of his job last April and entered Parliament -- which grants immunity from prosecution -- but he has not been seen for months. Mr. Melnichenko said the American C.I.A. and F.B.I. had presented evidence to Mr. Kuchma of Mr. Bakai's diversion of funds to the United States, where Mr. Bakai is said to have amassed millions of dollars in real estate, including a multimillion-dollar compound in Naples, Fla. American officials said Mr. Bakai, like Mr. Volkov, was barred from traveling to the United States because of alleged involvement in money-laundering.

HEADLINE: Reversing Decades-Long Trend, Americans Retiring Later in Life 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
For nearly a century, Americans were able to retire at ever-younger ages and in greater prosperity. But over the last few years, they have begun staying on the job later into life.
 As companies cut pensions and retiree medical coverage, many aging employees doubt they can afford to retire, several experts and workers say. 
 While tight labor markets are also keeping older people at work, other causes appear likely to outlast the current worker shortage. "We have entered a new era," said Joseph F. Quinn, an economist and a dean at Boston College. 
Government data show that the percentage of people over 65 who still work has been rising since the mid-1990's. Last year, at 12.8 percent, it was higher than at any time since 1979.
Economists and specialists on aging cite forces that include changes in the Social Security system, a ban on most forced retirements and the economy's shift away from back-breaking jobs like those in mining and heavy manufacturing. There have also been advances in medicine, so that even as more elder-friendly jobs in the service sector appear, more people are healthy enough to fill them.
To many workers approaching the end of their careers, however, the most important factor has been the erosion of pensions, health insurance and other retirement benefits they had expected.
"Lots and lots of people's expectations are being dashed," said Norman Stein, a law professor at the University of Alabama who specializes in pension issues. "Getting rid of a retirement incentive will, of course, have some impact on employees."
Jerry Michels, 49, is a case in point. As a late-in-life father of a young son, Mr. Michels thought he had a good plan for balancing work and parenthood: In 2007, he would be 55 and eligible for early retirement. His company, then a market research division of Dun & Bradstreet, linked pensions to pay and seniority, and Mr. Michels, who has spent his career at the company, figured he would get about $52,000 a year. That would be more than enough to finance a cozy interlude of football games, driving lessons and heart-to-heart talks before young Matthew left for college.
But late last year, Mr. Michels realized that his pension plan was revamped in 1996, when his division was spun off by its corporate parent. The stipend that he had been counting on was replaced by a smaller one under a new plan that built benefits more slowly.
Now Mr. Michels says he cannot afford to retire at 55 -- maybe not even at 65, if he wants to rebuild his new pension to the value of the one he lost. By then, Matthew will be gone.
"It would have been a nice life," Mr. Michels said.
But Mr. Michels will not be wanting for company as he plugs on.
"The increase in participation rates translates into a million more people over 65 in the labor force than there were in 1985," said Sara E. Rix, senior policy adviser for the AARP.
Economists say that these workers' payments into the Social Security system will be largely offset by the higher benefits they will receive.
Companies have reduced their retiree benefits not only to save money, but also to address labor shortages. Many of the pension conversions of the past decade have eliminated incentives to retire at some age before 65, as companies have seen a need to retain the 50-something workers they might have wanted to remove from their payrolls a decade ago. Companies have also been snapping up older workers who have taken early retirement bonuses from other employers. 
A century ago, when the first major pension plan was created, for Union veterans of the Civil War, few people could afford to save for retirement. They feared outliving their ability to work.
"In many cases, they faced a life of impoverishment," said Murray Gendell, a former Georgetown University professor of demographics who continues to track the average retirement age in his own retirement.
But over the past century, rising incomes permitted more workers to save for old age. Fewer kept working. The advent of private pension plans and the growth of Social Security added momentum.
In 1950, 7 of every 10 65-year-old American men were working, but by 1985, just 3 were.
"Gradually, the fear was replaced by an attitude that retirement was a reward for the work you have done for 35 or 40 years," Mr. Gendell said.
As vast numbers of baby boomers entered the work force in the mid-1960's, employers, spotting a mother lode of cheaper labor, offered early retirement packages to the preceding generation to clear the way.
"Employers found older workers expensive and expendable, so they got rid of them," said Eric Lofgren, global director of the benefits consulting group at Watson Wyatt Worldwide, which has advised many large American companies on their pension plans and other benefits.
So eagerly did companies buy out older workers, he said, that in the 1980s, "two-thirds of all retirements were through early retirement windows."
Then something changed. The proportion of the elderly in the work-force, which had been falling so steadily, leveled off in 1985. And in the latter half of the 1990's, it began edging up. Only 1 in 10 retirees today leaves as part of an early retirement program, Mr. Lofgren said.
Mr. Quinn, of Boston College, noted that 1986 legislation prohibited most forms of mandatory retirement. 
About the same time, the Social Security Administration began to change rules that had reduced the benefits to workers who stayed on the job late in life. "If you think about the carrot and the stick, the stick is gone," Mr. Quinn said.
These changes have been welcomed by the many healthy older Americans who like their jobs. Marguerite Beck-Rex, for one, works nine-hour days as an archivist at the United States Senate. She is 69 and wants nothing less.
"It's important to me to remain connected to the things that make a difference in everybody's life," she said. 
Ms. Beck-Rex is a widow with a mortgage, but she says her decision to work has little to do with a paycheck. Last year, she said, when she was working as an editor of newsletters, she started writing a book on what she calls croning, or the process of gaining stature with age.
"I thought I was going to enter another part of my life, where being older and wiser and less the active person was going to be my role," she said.
But then she heard about the opening for an archivist, and the book took a back seat to the more compelling work of organizing public documents for scholarly research.
"I don't want to be just the mentor," Ms. Beck-Rex said. "I want to continue with an active role in seeing that the world gets to be a better place."
Economists say that many others, however, stay at work because they see no other choice.
"We've got to look at different groups and how they experience retirement," said Eric R. Kingson, professor of social work at Syracuse University. "I think many people can't retire."
Diane Savage, a retirement planner for Watson Wyatt, said that earlier in her 25-year career, her clients often had solid assets and predictable cash flows.
"They would have the option of taking payouts of $400,000," instead of receiving a monthly pension, she said. "I'm talking about average people, like steelworkers. People would have their pension. They would have Social Security. They would have their medical coverage, and they'd have a little bit of extra money."
Not the aging workers at her seminars today. Their employers have cut back or eliminated health insurance for retirees. Nor do her mostly middle-class customers have six-figure payouts coming, or livable pensions. The tendency in recent years for employees to move from job to job has kept some people from building up much of a pension anywhere, she said. And many employers have eliminated traditional pensions.
People thinking of retiring before they turn 65 -- when they become eligible for Medicare -- often discover that their pensions will not be enough to buy their own health coverage, Ms. Savage said.
"I was speaking to someone yesterday," she said. "His premium for his medical insurance was going to be $100 more than his pension payment. He looked at me and said, 'Well, you know what I'm going to do.' He had been doing hard, physical work for 20 or 30 years, and I think otherwise he'd have liked to quit."
Mr. Lofgren urges his corporate clients to retain older workers by treating them well, offering flexible schedules, "phased retirement" programs and other favorable conditions, despite the costs. But not all of them listen. Many just go for the pension cuts.
"Employers have developed a very tough nut for themselves," Mr. Lofgren said. "They've spent the last 20 years doing all these downsizings, very convincingly sending the message to older workers that 'we don't value you.' Now they want to keep older workers, so they're not paying them to leave, and everybody's yelling."
Mr. Michels, who planned to retire early, thinks cutbacks in retirement benefits are what are keeping so many older Americans at work.
"The pension conversion seems to be this silent thing happening out there in America," he said. "If you see a 65-year-old person waiting on you at a McDonald's, it might be because it's nice to have something to do during the day. But I've got to believe that, hey, it's because they still need that check."

HEADLINE: El Salvador Says Earthquake Aid From Foreign Nations Is Lagging 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: VERAPAZ, El Salvador, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
Six weeks after a disastrous earthquake and two weeks after a second major quake, Salvadoran officials say assistance from abroad, especially the United States, is lagging.
 With 1.2 million people left homeless -- one of every six Salvadorans -- officials say they are racing against time and running out of patience. They are worried about an all but guaranteed third disaster when the rainy season begins in May, bringing with it a very real danger of mudslides, floods and disease that could overwhelm them. 
 Foreign aid -- volunteers, donations of food and medicine and outright grants -- has helped this country recover from the first quake, on Jan. 13, which killed more than 800 people, and another on Feb. 13 that killed close to 300. 
But officials say they need more sustained help from governments and international groups that are juggling priorities and emergencies, like helping India after its own major earthquake last month. 
An equal concern for many people here has been what they view as a relative lack of leadership shown by the United States, which has so far provided $10 million in aid, less than half of what Spain has provided. 
They contrast the United States contribution with the money and attention lavished on this embattled nation during its 12-year civil war, when Washington-backed soldiers fought bitterly against leftist rebels in the name of building democracy.
President Francisco Flores will go to Washington in a few days to seek more help from the United States, not just in direct aid, but in a grant of temporary protected immigration status to Salvadorans who are working in the United States and sending home more than $1.5 billion each year.
"In all the other natural disasters here, the United States was with us," Mr. Flores said in an interview on Friday. "Today, unfortunately, the first earthquake happened at the worst time for the United States, one week before the end of one president's mandate, and we understand the transition has affected their capacity to respond."
In El Salvador's second quake, exactly a month after the first, entire villages, like this one east of the capital, were almost destroyed. Officials estimate losses from both earthquakes at almost $3 billion. Tens of thousands are jobless, left without homes that doubled as barbershops, stores or restaurants, or without fields to till after landslides roared down the slopes of hills and volcanoes.
Today, in this devastated town that was nearly destroyed by the second quake, Emilio Jose Santos, who is blind, shuffled along with a broomstick and a child to lead the way. 
He was oblivious to the piles of rubble on every block, the lines of people waiting for food or even the pale yellow clouds of dust swirling about his weary head. He was searching, with his heart rather than his eyes, for someone to help ease the suffering he has endured since he lost his home and store in the quake.
"I'm not giving myself up for lost, and I'm blind," he said. "I'm trying to see if some institution can give me a hand."
But Salvadorans say that helping hand is becoming harder to find. Officials of international aid groups said that while the response to the first earthquake was fast and generous, the second earthquake came just when people thought the worst was over. And while international aid givers have not reached their limits, attention can quickly shift to other problems. 
"Governments have to make choices where to give funds," said Abby Spring, spokeswoman for the United Nations World Food Program, which has received only $2 million of the $10 million it requested from donor nations to feed 200,000 of the most vulnerable victims for the next six months. "We're kind of in this Russian roulette."
This is not an entirely new experience for El Salvador. After the havoc wrought in 1998 by Hurricane Mitch, government officials said, billions of dollars were pledged by donor nations, but much less was received.
With tens of thousands of people living in temporary shelters, some with as little as a carpet stretched on a rope between trees for protection, the rush is on for temporary housing. Several international aid groups have already begun building temporary homes of wood and zinc panels, but supplies of lumber, metal and even nails are low.
"Traditionally, we had the capacity to build 20,000 houses a year," Mr. Flores said. "Today, we need to build 200,000 in one and a half months."
He received some good news on Friday from the Inter-American Development Bank, which gave permission to redirect $200 million in loans destined for development projects to emergency construction.
After weeks of arguing with his political foes in the legislature -- former rebel leaders he faulted for seeking concessions on everything from the economy to aid distribution -- Mr. Flores finally was able to get them to approve other needed loans. 
Soon after his trip to Washington, he will go to Madrid, where a consortium of 20 donor nations will consider other grants and loans to help the country rebuild.
"The trauma of two earthquakes means that those who were most vulnerable have passed from poverty into misery," he said. "What happens in a country after a catastrophe this big is the gap between resources and need is widened. We will have to close that gap with some aggressive steps." 
In the town of San Agustin, sacrifice is all that the residents have known since the first earthquake destroyed most of their houses. They talk about punishment or providence and say they lost their homes but clung to life, such as it is, surrounded by the debris of their past.
About a dozen listless families are still living in makeshift tents spread out in the town square, where pigs and dogs root through the dirt. The plaintive sound of accordion music mixes with that of hammers on metal as some of the more fortunate have begun to build temporary houses. About 55 homes have been built, a fraction of what is needed.
"There was some help but not enough, and it slowed down after the second earthquake," said Juan Antonio Leon, a farmer who is now without crops to tend, as he nailed a metal panel to a post. "We're just waiting for the winter so maybe we can go back to the fields." 
Although donor nations have praised the response of the Salvadoran government, some aid groups have said its apparent reluctance to concede any political or financial power has delayed aid efforts in some areas.
William Keh, a New Yorker who is a leader of a Buddhist volunteer relief group based in Taiwan, said that his group had enough money to build 1,400 homes but that only 300 might be built before the rainy season.
"We are trying to make it faster, but the bureaucracy is killing us," he said, taking a break from a food distribution project in Verapaz. "We are trying to persuade the government to allocate the land to us to build permanent homes." 
In the nearby town of Guadalupe, families have yet to hear when they might be able to leave behind the makeshift tents they set up in a shaded clearing. Children run about the yard, where an altar has been set up with a crucifix and a poster of a guardian angel has been tacked to a tree in thanksgiving for their survival.
"My daughter has changed," said Maria del Socorro Mejia. "She is disobedient. She is nervous and her hands tremble. She wants to do everything fast. Sometimes when she sleeps, she talks. 'Mommy, Mommy, it's shaking!' "
Fear is the bond that unites young and old. Juan Antonio Lozano, 62, said he was still too scared to return to the coffee fields where he worked. He and his family remember how the most recent earthquake sent tons of dirt crashing down the sides of the volcano that towers over the fields.
"I'm not brave enough to go back there," he said. "First we had the war. Then Mitch. Then the earthquakes. What is going to happen next, the end of the world?"

HEADLINE: Millions Eligible For Food Stamps Aren't Applying 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND 

 BODY:
As she weighs bunches of purple grapes or rings up fat chicken legs at the supermarket where she works, Fannie Payne cannot keep from daydreaming. 
 "It's difficult to work at a grocery store all day, looking at all the food I can't buy," Mrs. Payne said. "So I imagine filling up my cart with one of those big orders and bringing home enough food for all my kids." 
 Instead, she said that she and her husband, Michael, a factory worker, routinely go without dinner to make sure their four children have enough to eat. They visit a private hunger center monthly for three days' worth of free groceries, to help stretch the $60 a week they spend on food. 
But they have yet to turn to the government for food stamps.
"I've never talked to anyone in government assistance," Mrs. Payne said. "I didn't think we'd be eligible because we own a home and a car."
Workers at the local food bank said it appeared the Paynes might qualify for food stamps. Local welfare officials said their eligibility could not be determined unless the family filled out an application, which the Paynes said they now intended to do.
The Paynes say they have never been solicited to apply for food stamps. In that, they are not alone. In a study last year, the Department of Agriculture reported that at least 12 million people -- including at least a million children -- are not receiving food stamps even though they are eligible. Based on detailed annual surveys of tens of thousands of people, the Census Bureau has estimated that 3.7 million households experience hunger as a result of not having enough money for food, and that many more -- 9.7 percent of all households -- cannot reliably afford all their basic food needs.
"There is no reason that any American in 2001 should go hungry," said Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, who is chairman of the Agriculture Committee. "States should do everything possible to make certain that those who qualify for food stamps know it and are enrolled if they so choose. That was the intent of the law."
Yet that has not happened in most states. Despite studies warning that bureaucratic hurdles discourage the poor from applying for food stamps, states have been wary of streamlining their application processes.
A major reason, some critics say, is that states fear they will be penalized by the federal government for giving recipients too much in food stamps -- or too little. In 1996, Arizona was fined $21 million because of the high number of errors its social workers made in calculating the size of benefits. Those complicated calculations are based on mandates drawn up by the Agriculture Department to deter fraud. But as a result, many states require the poor to fill out long applications and visit welfare offices every three months to make sure the benefits are correct.
"This is a nutrition program and it should be simplified," said Joseph Gauntner, director of Cuyahoga Health and Nutrition, a tough critic of the food stamp program he administers for the county that includes Cleveland. "Now the rules read like a welfare program that is all about preventing fraud with ridiculously rigorous requirements for a benefit that averages only $73 a month."
Food stamp rolls have tumbled to 17 million people from 24.9 million at the time of the 1996 welfare overhaul law, according to Agriculture Department figures. Only half of that drop can be attributed to the strong economy or new restrictions that removed the eligibility of some adults without children and immigrants, according to studies by the Agriculture Department and the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal public policy research group.
"Food stamp participation has fallen much more than the strength of the economy would explain," said Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, the senior Democrat on the Agriculture Committee. "At the same time, the demands on food banks, soup kitchens and similar food sources have increased markedly."
America's Second Harvest, the principal nonprofit source for food banks across the country, has doubled the amount of food it distributes, to two billion pounds in the last two years, says Douglas O'Brien, the group's policy director. 
Ohio had one of the steepest declines in food stamp participation. In 1994, 80 percent of the state's eligible poor received food stamps. Last year, 59 percent got them.
Mr. Gauntner wants the state to streamline application forms and procedures for food stamps and adopt options offered by Congress in November that would adjust rules to reflect the higher cost of living, including a change that would allow a family on food stamps to own a reliable car for work. 
He also wants money for a program to tell people about food stamps.
"Working doesn't mean you're getting out of poverty anymore," Mr. Gauntner said. "The issue isn't getting people to work anymore, it's figuring out how to help them feed themselves after they come home from work." 
Rather than urging an expansion of food stamp programs, Mr. Lugar proposes greater tax benefits for corporations and small businesses that donate food to the nonprofit private food banks. He said that this could encourage producers and restaurants to donate some of the more than 80 billion pounds of food wasted each year in the United States. 
As Ohio's food stamp rolls plunged, demand at private food banks like the Euclid Hunger Center in suburban Cleveland exploded. When it opened 10 years ago, the center was an emergency pantry for 100 families. Last year it helped 1,000 families, giving out 255,000 pounds of groceries -- canned soups, pasta, vegetables -- from the Cleveland Food Bank. 
Fannie Payne signed up there and, with a family of six on an income of $1,900 a month, qualified for three bags of groceries each month.
Lisa Hamler-Podolski, executive director of Ohio's branch of Second Harvest, said that a third of the people at Ohio's food banks last year were first-time users.
"They are a new class of people, mainly working poor, who are running out of resources," Ms. Hamler-Podolski said.
"We're behind on all of our bills," Mrs. Payne said. "We don't pay electricity until they threaten a cutoff. To be honest, I'm behind two months on the mortgage -- that's $600 a month. We owe $800 on the water bill and $500 for heat."
The Euclid Hunger Center helped her seek aid from her parish, St. William's Catholic Church. But it hurt that three cars broke down in six months. 
"They all died and we had to get Mike to work, so we bought a good used car we can't afford," she said.
The first thing to go was money for food for herself and her husband.
"Some nights Mike and I eat our kids' leftovers, and when I don't have any money for milk I feed the kids soup for breakfast," she said.
Discount coupons helped Mrs. Payne stretch her money, but each month the situation got worse. 
Recently her husband volunteered for his factory's latest shift, 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., to earn extra money. She started working four days a week, 5 p.m. to midnight. Now their 13-year-old daughter, Kali, is in charge of the house from 10 to midnight, looking after the sleeping children -- Sara, 9, Joseph, 7, and Alex, 3.
Joseph has noticed that food has grown scarce lately. When he and his mother were shopping recently, Joseph stopped a stranger with food bulging out of her cart and asked her if she was rich.
"No," the woman answered. "I have to feed a big family of five people."
"We're a family of six people," Joseph said, "and we could never buy that much food."

HEADLINE: Urban Renewal For Tower of Babel; 
Bilingual Education in the City Is a Monument to Inconsistency

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
Last fall, Alicia Julian Campos was dismayed when administrators at a public school in Bushwick, Brooklyn, enrolled her 6-year-old daughter, Jennifer, who was born in New York City and speaks English, in an all-Spanish-speaking class for the second year in a row and kept her there against the mother's will for weeks. Mrs. Campos, a Mexican immigrant, later learned that the move was the result of a mistake in interpreting Jennifer's test score, but she believes such mistakes happen a lot at a school where administrators try hard to sustain bilingual education.
 In East Harlem, school administrators called Jose and Maria del Carmen Ortega to a meeting to urge them to pull their son, Johnny, out of bilingual education classes after he scored above average proficiency in English. While the parents, Mexican immigrants, were nervous that he would not be able to make it in an all-English class, they believed in their son and the advice of his teachers. He is performing well in the class. 
 The two tales demonstrate how bilingual education programs operate differently in each of the city's 32 school districts, especially on pivotal issues like parental choice. Tomorrow the Board of Education is expected to approve the largest overhaul of bilingual education in more than two decades and a crucial change will give parents more control over their children's placement in bilingual education programs. Other changes will make it more difficult to keep a child in bilingual programs longer than three years and will give parents more options, including placement in a dual language program that alternates between English one day and a foreign language the next.
The changes are partly in response to the haphazard and inconsistent way that bilingual programs function in various schools and the wide spectrum of quality in the classes themselves. 
Parents and community advocates complain that at some schools children learn too little English, spending almost all their time in front of teachers who themselves may not speak English well or who lack training. Parents say that the exam used to place students in the program is flawed and that the screening process sometimes sweeps children like Jennifer, who do not belong, into the classes. Currently, children who fail a test of English competence are automatically placed in bilingual classes, but parents may request to have them moved to state-mandated classes in English as a second language.
Yet at other schools, like the Bilingual Bicultural Mini School in East Harlem, administrators and teachers do not try to force children into bilingual classes and move bilingual children into mainstream English classes within the state's recommended three-year period. And the classes themselves are regarded by educational monitors as top-notch. Even though Board of Education guidelines say that parents must be consulted before students are moved in or out of bilingual education programs, many parents in Bushwick have had to fight administrators to move their children, said Sister Kathy Maire, an organizer of East Brooklyn Congregations, an advocacy group that has worked with Mrs. Campos and other Latino parents in Bushwick. She and other critics charge that administrators want to keep bilingual education classes filled primarily to keep teachers employed and help bureaucracy perpetuate itself.
"Parental consent would be a significant change in the way the program functions," Sister Maire said. "Sometimes these parents don't realize until their children are in the third grade that they can't read in English."
Administrators at some schools shuffle certain students into bilingual education classes when they run out of space in all-English classrooms, critics say. Others push non-English-speaking special education and middle and high school students into bilingual education classes where they can languish without learning English, they maintain.
Proponents of bilingual education say that it would be a mistake to paint bilingual education with such a broad brush. Bilingual education, they say, is not one program, but an array of programs that have varying degrees of success. They point to schools like Johnny Ortega's, the Bilingual Bicultural Mini School. They also point to Public School 189, the Bilingual Center in East New York, Brooklyn, which has programs in Haitian Creole, Spanish and French that have catapulted students to elite schools like Brooklyn Technical High School and Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan over the years. 
The advocates of bilingual education also note that many recent immigrants enroll in public schools with an assortment of social baggage that makes it difficult for them to assimilate quickly, including the poverty of their homes, learning disabilities and illiteracy in their native languages. 
"Mother Nature is not a Communist, O.K.?" said Ludovic Dauphin, a bilingual education teacher at P.S. 189, who specializes in teaching mathematics. "She made some of us good and some of us bad. Some of us are intelligent and some of us are slow. So, you cannot put up a target date and say, 'Oh, after two years, that child should be speaking English.' I'm not saying you have to leave a child with me indefinitely, either. I'm just saying it takes time."
The barrel-chested Mr. Dauphin is no softy. He has the teaching style of a drill sergeant. A Haitian immigrant himself, the 25-year veteran of the school system expects his students to learn English quickly. While teaching a seventh-grade class how to locate points on a coordinate plane, he sprinkled some English in with his Haitian Creole, a language that is pronounced phonetically. Many of the students had moved to New York recently from Haiti. Some did not have a formal education.
"Ki sa ou te fe la a? (What did you do?)" Mr. Dauphin asked 11-year-old Elizabeth Louis during a math lesson, leaning over her desk and picking up her paper. She had drawn two unequal squares.
"You see that is one, O.K.?" he said, reviewing her work with her. "Look at the other one. They are not the same lengths. Ekri li nan lot fas papye a (Write it on the other side of the paper,)" he said, flipping her paper over.
P.S. 189, a kindergarten-through-eighth-grade school, aims to teach immigrant children major subjects like mathematics, science and other subjects in their native languages to avoid having them miss the basics they need at their grade level.
The schools that function properly help students become literate in their native languages and provide enrichment classes for native speakers to maintain bilingualism, said Eliane D. Clermont, principal of P.S. 189. 
The program has 18 teachers and about 450 of the 1,230 students at P.S. 189 are enrolled in it.
During Mr. Dauphin's lecture the other day, there were two other teachers in the room. Jean Hubert, the special education teacher, walked from desk to desk answering students' questions, and Nancy Dejean, the regular classroom teacher worked with six non-English-speaking students who had moved to New York from Haiti as recently as a month ago.
The staff at the Bilingual Bicultural Mini School is just as diligent, and the school has become one of the city's models for efficient programs that quickly move students into English classes. All 18 of the teachers at the school are certified in bilingual education and the school adheres to a rigorous curriculum, said Lourdes Arroyo, the director of the program. 
Each morning, students in kindergarten through second grade read the alphabet from colorful cards, chanting the alphabet and saying words that match each letter phonetically. For the letter B in some classrooms, voices rise in song, saying "beating heart: B- B- B." 
The exercise is part of a 90-minute literacy block. During that time, students also receive instruction in English as a second language and in their native language, which is Spanish at the Bilingual Bicultural Mini School, part of Public School 83.
The instruction seems to have worked well for Teresa and Rubi Made, 6-year-old twins, who recently moved to Spanish Harlem from Puerto Rico. When they enrolled at P.S. 83 in mid-September they spoke limited English, said their teacher, Jennifer Urove-Martinez.
Now, the shy little girls know the alphabet and can read simple words. On most days, they sit in a semicircle on a rug, heads bowed, reading words like "hello," "the," and "see," from their phonics books in their class of 25 students. They can ask to go to the bathroom and can respond in English to lessons in class, Mrs. Urove-Martinez said. 
"It's a fallacy that children cannot speak or write in English by the time that they leave kindergarten," Mrs. Urove-Martinez said of students who enter kindergarten unable to speak English. "We are living proof. When they leave, they have the foundation necessary to begin the first grade. Some make the transition to an English-speaking class. It all depends on the child." 
Johnny Ortega appears to have adjusted well to his fourth-grade gifted class and benefited from a strong foundation in science, social studies and math, said his teacher, Diane Guiterman. "He's really met the challenge," Mrs. Guiterman said. "He knows his life science from when he was little and being taught in Spanish." 
Mrs. Guiterman said she was certain that Johnny will meet the standard on the state's English Language Arts test.
While stories like Johnny's are plentiful, stories like Jennifer's grab the headlines. Ada Orlando, the principal at Public School 376, where Jennifer goes to school, refused to comment, as did Felix Vazquez, the superintendent of District 32.
Mrs. Campos, who speaks little English, said that the frustration began last year when administrators refused to remove Jennifer from an Spanish-speaking kindergarten class. Eventually, she gave up. Under Board of Education guidelines, administrators can recommend to a parent that a child be placed in a bilingual education program if a language besides English is spoken in the home. But the placement can only be made with a parent's consent. 
The same bilingual placement happened again in September, Mrs. Campos said. This time, she said, a school secretary told her that Jennifer had not passed the Language Assessment Battery test, the exam used to determine English proficiency, and that she could not be placed in an English-speaking class.
Mrs. Campos obtained the test scores from the District 32 office, which showed that Jennifer scored in the 75th percentile -- 35 points above the recommended score to move students out of bilingual education. Shortly after that, officials moved Jennifer to an English-speaking class.
"If a child speaks English, they have a right to be in the English-speaking class and I, as the parent, have the right to choose," Mrs. Campos said.

HEADLINE: United Might Sell 3 Carriers As Part of USAirways Deal 

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
United Airlines is negotiating to sell three regional airlines now owned by US Airways to Atlantic Coast Airlines, one of United's largest commuter carriers, several people close to the talks said yesterday.
 The discussions still could fail, one person said, but a second person said there might be an announcement as early as this week, though a price was still being negotiated. "The feeling was that they were getting pretty close at the end of last week," this person said. 
 A deal involving all three airlines would vault fast-growing Atlantic Coast, which is independent, over a half-dozen competitors to become the country's second-largest regional airline, after American Eagle.
In recent weeks, United has told both Wall Street and its employees that it might sell the three regional airlines, Allegheny, Piedmont and PSA, which United would acquire as part of its proposed $4.3 billion takeover of US Airways.
Representatives of United and of Atlantic Coast declined to comment yesterday. The talks with Atlantic Coast were reported on Saturday in The Washington Post.
Unlike the AMR Corporation, which owns both American Airlines and American Eagle, the UAL Corporation, United's parent, does not own any regional carriers, which fly small jets or propeller planes to connect smaller cities to hub airports operated by the major airlines. Instead, United has agreements with four independent regional airlines, which fly some of their planes as United Express but which also may serve other airlines.
Flight attendants at regional carriers earn far less than those who fly for the major airlines. Under United's contract with its flight attendants, if it bought the regional airlines, it would have to pay their flight attendants the same wage scale as its mainline employees. "It's simply not economical," one of the people close to the talks said.
United could ask the union representing its flight attendants for a waiver, but the two are already in difficult negotiations over a midcontract wage increase. In fact, the union, the Association of Flight Attendants, has threatened to block the United-US Airways deal in court if United does not reach a wage agreement. To avoid any conflict, United is insisting that any sale close at the same time as its purchase of US Airways.
Any deal would be contingent on regulatory approval of United's purchase of US Airways. That deal is still awaiting approval from antitrust officials in the Justice Department. It has come under considerable criticism from members of Congress who say that it will lead to higher fares and diminished service.
Any new deal involving regional carriers would also face scrutiny by antitrust authorities.
United and US Airways executives have assured their employees and political leaders in the communities the regional airlines serve that neither jobs nor service will be compromised as a result of a sale.
The deal could easily cost Atlantic Coast $1 billion. In 1999, Delta bought the stakes it did not already own in two of its regional affiliates. Comair, the second-largest regional carrier, was valued at $2.3 billion. Atlantic Southeast Airlines, the sixth largest, was valued at $972 million.
Atlantic Coast has 106 airplanes, half of which are jets, flew about 3.8 million passengers last year and has about 3,200 employees. Its biggest operation is at Dulles International Airport outside of Washington. It also flies for Delta Air Lines as Delta Express.

HEADLINE: High-Stakes Appeal Could Be Last Court Date for Microsoft 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
After years of bruising setbacks before a deeply skeptical federal district judge, Microsoft moves upstairs in the court house on Monday morning. There it will find an appeals forum that in the past has been receptive to its antitrust defenses, but that now could also present potentially fatal pitfalls.
 Lawyers for Microsoft and its adversaries at the Justice Department will begin two days of oral arguments before seven appeals judges in a case of historic dimensions for consumers, the computer industry and the law. With no guarantee that the Supreme Court would agree to hear any further appeals, the judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit may wind up with the definitive word on the most important antitrust case in a generation. 
 "There can be no doubt, the D.C. Circuit is treating this as an epic case of profound importance to the national economy but also to the law of antitrust," said Kenneth W. Starr, the former Whitewater independent counsel and one of a large group of prominent lawyers who have been drawn into the case. Mr. Starr has filed a brief supporting the breakup of Microsoft. 
Last year, Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered Microsoft to be split into two companies after finding that it had repeatedly bullied rivals and violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. Microsoft has countered that Judge Jackson committed a raft of procedural and substantive errors and that he was biased against it.
For all of the legal niceties that will be explored over seven hours of oral arguments, the overriding issue is whether a decision by the appeals court will rekindle settlement negotiations or push Microsoft closer to a breakup. Bush administration officials have decided to await the decision before considering whether to continue on the same course as the Clinton administration or to retrench and return to the bargaining table.
Microsoft's lawyers are hoping for a big win, forcing the new leadership at the Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general to a beat hasty retreat or accept a settlement less painful for the company. But Microsoft's competitors are lobbying the new administration to hold firm, arguing that since the case began, the market share of Microsoft has continued to grow.
Microsoft's biggest win in this long-running case occurred before a three-judge panel of this same appeals court, which in 1998 struck down Judge Jackson's preliminary injunction that had ordered Microsoft to split its Internet Explorer Web browser from its Windows operating system.
That issue is once again before the bigger appeals panel, but it is not the most prominent one. The appeals court is expected to spend the largest share of its time during oral arguments considering whether Microsoft had maintained a monopoly through anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The court will also consider an assortment of other legal issues, including whether it is appropriate to break up the company and whether Judge Jackson acted properly in making a series of comments about the case to journalists and in lectures after the trial. 
Microsoft's biggest obstacle is the powerful record amassed by the government that detailed a series of incidents involving rivals and other companies -- including Netscape, Apple Computer, Intel and Sun Microsystems -- that Judge Jackson concluded constituted violations of the Sherman Act. 
But some legal analysts say that Judge Jackson's decision is hardly bulletproof. And his comments after the trial, particularly his public acknowledgment that he tried to sweep as many conclusions as possible into his findings of fact, are certain to be scrutinized. 
Like many trial judges, Judge Jackson sought to enlarge his factual findings because federal appeals courts must defer to the factual conclusions of trial judges and can only overturn such conclusions when they are "clearly erroneous." By contrast, the appeals courts need not show any deference to the trial court in considering whether to reverse legal conclusions. 
Thus a central issue in the arguments will almost certainly be whether many conclusions by Judge Jackson -- like one that Microsoft is a monopolist that improperly exercised its market power -- are conclusions of law that can be easily reversed, or conclusions of fact that must be accorded deference.
For months, the appeals court has been eagerly awaiting the case. When the Justice Department moved to skip over the court and take all appeals directly to the Supreme Court, the appeals court rejected that motion -- but announced that it would consider the case quickly, and that the full appeals court would consider the suit, rather than just the traditional three-judge panel. Without providing an explanation, three of the 10 active judges on the court have removed themselves from considering the case.
In recent years, the appeals court has been deeply polarized politically among appointees of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush and those of Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. But on issues presented in the antitrust case, party affiliation is a notoriously poor barometer.
Indeed, Judge Jackson, a Reagan appointee viewed as a judicial conservative, wound up siding with the Clinton administration and against Microsoft on virtually every major point of fact and law.
In a sign of how the case has come to attract legal talent and defy easy partisan labeling, Mr. Starr's brief supporting the breakup of Microsoft was also signed by Walter E. Dellinger III, a Clinton administration solicitor general, and Robert H. Bork, a Nixon administration solicitor general whose nomination to the Supreme Court by President Reagan was blocked by the Senate.
A brief filed by industry groups supporting Microsoft was signed by Lloyd N. Cutler (the White House counsel in the Clinton and Carter administrations), C. Boyden Gray (Mr. Cutler's law partner and White House counsel in the administration of former President Bush), and Griffin B. Bell, the attorney general in the Carter administration.
The new administration has made a calculated decision to await the outcome of the appeals court before deciding whether to rekindle negotiations to resolve the case. 
"After the court rules, the administration will take a look at it," said Mr. Gray, who filed a brief on behalf of the Association for Competitive Technology, a pro-Microsoft trade group. "A review of the litigation posture after an important appeals ruling is typical of any administration."
Mr. Gray, who maintains close connections to senior officials in the new administration, predicted that the case would ultimately be settled on terms far less onerous for Microsoft than a breakup because of the White House's commitment to less regulation.
"I think it's headed for settlement," he said. "I think Microsoft will win some back. Given the fact that they came so close before to a settlement, chances are good that the case will settle."
He said the new administration had little emotional investment in the case and had vowed to have a far lighter hand when it comes to regulatory matters.
"Joel Klein's words, to paraphrase him, were that this was a model of how we intend to regulate the new economy," Mr. Gray said, referring to the chief architect of the case and former head of the Justice Department's antitrust division. "I don't think the new administration wants to regulate the new economy." 
But critics of the company, including those who represent some of the nation's most powerful Internet companies, say the new administration will be hard pressed to settle the case.
"There is a danger that this will be called the Microsoft pardon," said Edward J. Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.

HEADLINE: A Legacy Yet to Be Determined 

BYLINE:  By Michael Beschloss; Michael Beschloss, author of "Taking Charge," the first volume of a trilogy on the Lyndon Johnson tapes, is also working on a book on the Lincoln assassination.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Right now, when most Americans think of Bill Clinton, they seem to think of him copping a plea to escape indictment for perjury, snatching furniture from the White House collection, handing out pardons to drug kingpins and fugitive swindlers whose causes were peddled by his brother-in-law and lavish political donors. 
 The good news for Mr. Clinton is that a president's reputation often changes in the decades after he leaves the White House. The bad news is that sometimes the reputation looks a lot worse. 
 Few presidents have read more presidential history than Mr. Clinton, and it is hard to think of a president who has spent more time thinking of moves that might impress future historians. Mr. Clinton's efforts to "spin" his reputation attracted such attention that by 2000, an Israeli television reporter asked him if he was trying to force a Mideast settlement because he was "looking desperately for the missing chapter of your legacy." 
It should comfort Bill Clinton to know that guessing how future historians will see him is, at least for now, an entertaining but futile parlor game. History provides, above all, two things -- information and hindsight -- and a month after a presidency is over, there is no way to know where the roller coaster will lead. 
During the decades after a president leaves, we learn all sorts of things that were withheld from us when he was in the White House. Dwight Eisenhower's letters, diaries and other private records, released mainly in the 1970's, showed us that he was a far more alert and intelligent manager than most Americans had realized.
If the just-published "Reagan, In His Own Hand" is any guide, Ronald Reagan's private papers may show us that the Great Communicator was a better writer and thinker than even his fans understood. If Jimmy Carter ever decides to publish his private diaries, they are likely to show that the same values that Americans admire in Mr. Carter's ex-presidency were just as vibrant when he was in the Oval Office. 
This process of what lawyers would call intensive discovery can also bounce against a president's reputation. When President Warren Harding died suddenly in 1923, he was passionately mourned in every American city. But within a year, exposes about malfeasance within his inner circle exploded into the Teapot Dome scandal. Harding's ex-lover Nan Britton published a memoir insisting that the president had fathered her daughter. Even the upstanding members of Harding's cabinet soon found that when they were introduced to audiences as alumni of the Harding administration, people giggled. 
The passage of time reveals other presidential warts. Declassified documents told us of Franklin Roosevelt's abuse of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Bureau of Internal Revenue against political enemies. A Congressional committee and a presidential commission unveiled the Kennedy administration's assassination attempts against Fidel Castro. 
In a memoir published long after his service as Richard Nixon's chief of staff, Alexander Haig gave a first-hand account of Nixon's instability during his final days in office and his efforts to grab a pardon from Gerald Ford. A 1990 lawsuit lifted the lid on Nixon's secret financial success as an ex-president; he opened doors for corporate moguls and made business deals with foreign leaders like Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu. 
What we learn about a president is usually less important, however, than how these new facts are woven into his historical reputation with the benefit of distance. For example, when Calvin Coolidge left office, the 1920's boom was still roaring. Many expected Coolidge to be considered one of our greatest presidents. Only after the 1929 stock market crash and the thunderclap of the Great Depression did we comprehend the dangerous practices that undergirded the Coolidge prosperity.
When Harry Truman left office, many Americans were still fuming at him for firing General Douglas MacArthur, perhaps, as Senator Joseph McCarthy alleged, "under the midnight power of bourbon and benedictine." But with hindsight, most historians now venerate Truman for making a brave, unselfish decision that preserved civilian control of the American military. 
At the end of Dwight Eisenhower's presidency, even many of his loyalists feared that his obsession with balanced budgets had caused him to risk letting the Russians surpass us in military might. Nowadays, most scholars believe that Ike's half-century of military leadership enabled him to spend only what was necessary and avoid ruinous inflation -- even though he knew he would be derided by critics as a do-nothing president who was deaf to a growing danger. 
Richard Nixon spent the last 20 years of his life arguing, like the Ancient Mariner, that he had done little wrong. He said that he had not deserved removal from office and that accomplishments like the opening to China were more monumental than what he called "a little bugging." He predicted to friends that 50 years after his presidency, the Watergate scandal would have shriveled to "a footnote." On that, the jury is still out.
Only a month after his presidency, we now know that a historian of Bill Clinton will have to decide how much of his profile should consist of scandal and how much of it should be made up of, for example, whatever role he had in the 1990's economic miracle.
Truman left office under a cloud of misbehavior by some administration officials that had depressed his popularity and helped defeat the Democrats in 1952. A half-century later, the most important thing to know about Truman is, in fact, that he fathered NATO, the Marshall Plan and the strategy of containment that ultimately won the cold war. At the other end of the spectrum, Warren Harding is known as a fun-loving philanderer who oversaw a vigorous economy but was enmeshed in scandal. 
During the next several years, as the period of intensive historical discovery begins, we will gain a better understanding of whether the dark Clinton moments we now know of were isolated instances of atrocious judgment or the tip of an iceberg of consistent and flagrant abuse of presidential power. 
Whatever emerges, Mr. Clinton will surely argue that Clinton the Good should outshine Clinton the Bad. Nevertheless, if the Clinton scandals metastasize, the most important thing future generations may know about the 42nd president will be the pledge he trampled -- to create "the most ethical administration in the history of the Republic."

HEADLINE: Putin in Korea: A Mix of Trade And Politics 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is to arrive here on Monday to cement deals for his hard-pressed economy. It is the first visit by a Russian leader since Boris N. Yeltsin came in 1992.
 The Russians are just as eager now to expand economic ties, and to find a way to pay off debts that have grown to $1.8 billion. But they may also be looking for a chance to expand their role on both sides of the demilitarized zone that has divided the peninsula since the Korean War. 
 "Putin's desire is to reintroduce Russia into the scene," said Robert Scalapino, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and an expert on the region.
Andrei Osmakov, an official at the Russian Embassy here, said, "We need stability on the Korean peninsula because the Korean peninsula is a neighbor of Russia." 
Against that background, President Kim Dae Jung's efforts at reconciliation with the North are expected to be a major topic. Mr. Putin is also expected to stress his opposition to the American plan for a national missile defense. A danger from North Korea has been cited by Americans as one rationale for such a system.
The prospect of discussion of a tradeoff reflecting the policy aims of both leaders means the meeting is likely to be far more pointed than was the last South Korean-Russian summit meeting, in May 1999, when Mr. Kim saw Mr. Yeltsin in Moscow.
"Previously, Korea thought Russia could be a negotiator with North Korea," but those expectations have not been realized, said Kim Duk Joo, a specialist in Russian affairs at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security. "The Russians should participate in a dialogue on peaceful coexistence."
The Russian need for trade and investment is also expected to be high on Mr. Putin's agenda, especially development of natural gas in Irkutsk, with Moscow promoting a pipeline through North Korea to South Korea, and a Russian proposal to rebuild the rail network that once connected the Russian Far East to ports in the South.

HEADLINE: No Downturn at Las Vegas Casinos 

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
It can get very crowded here with people spending money as if they were all rich.
 The walkway connecting Bellagio and Caesars Palace, two of the fanciest casino resorts, got so jammed Saturday night that at one point everyone had to stop and just wait. The mall at the Venetian, which has the same stores found in many upscale malls, was as full as any shopping center could hope to be on Christmas Eve. The Paris, the Aladdin, Bally's, the Strip: all packed. 
 If the economy is flattening out and Americans are cutting back, you would never know it from visiting the easiest place in the country to publicly throw away cash. A week of bad economic news -- inflation increasing at the fastest pace in 10 months, the price of natural gas posting its sharpest recorded increase ever, economists sounding alarm bells about sagging consumer confidence -- did little to deflate the exuberance of the tourists who flock to Las Vegas. Men tossed $100 bills at the craps tables at Bellagio, lost it all in one bad roll of the dice and laughed. The restaurants, the cafes and the buffets had long lines and long waits.
On the weekend before President Bush's address on his budget and his tax proposal to Congress, many tourists here, no matter where they were from, said they were unsure about the need for tax cuts and supported Mr. Bush's plan, if they supported it at all, only if the cuts were limited. Few cared to discuss the president's proposal to repeal the estate tax. And when asked what they thought of the sinking economy, most people said the economy was not sinking at all. 
"I see a lot of people here and they all seem to be spending money and having a good time," said Marie Bruno, while a bride and groom, a family of six and a busload of tourists passed her slot machine at Caesars. 
"I'm not winning, I'm spending," she said in a New York accent that 10 years in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., had not changed. "But I have a great time here. I'm not worried. The economy is in great shape. The stock market is the only bad thing, and that'll bounce back."
Most people interviewed here said the same. Richard Smucker of Medina, Ohio, the president and chief executive of the jam and jelly company that bears his name, was attending a conference for chain restaurants and their suppliers. Mr. Smucker said he was sure that the recent dips in the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq were part of a natural cycle. 
"We've had an unprecedented eight years of growth," said Mr. Smucker, sitting at a cafe at Bellagio. "At some point the economy has to absorb that growth. I honestly don't think it'll be too long."
He said he supported President Bush's tax cut plan "if it's not expanded to appease the special interests." And though he said he believed the estate tax code should be amended so that people are not paying more than half of their estate money to the government, he did not support a repeal of the tax.
"When you have the 120 wealthiest Americans saying they're against the president's plan, you know he has work to do," Mr. Smucker said.
Carlos Joey Darden, 28, an economics major at the University of Utah, said the tax cut would be a hard sell in an economy that is doing "much better" than the professionals economists are saying.
"Bush is going to have his work cut out for him with these tax cuts," said Mr. Darden, who plans to become a day trader. "Any president needs a good crisis, and I think he is trying to make the economy his crisis. This is a superficial negative. Just looking at the economy -- it's been a bit choppy but it should be worse for what Washington is saying about it."
As for a tax cut, Mr. Darden offered an emphatic "No."
"It doesn't really help the lower and middle classes," he said. "I've seen in classic economic models that whenever you've given a tax cut, you have to be prepared to pay for it later."
Rodney Barnes went further. An assistant film director, on location at the shuttered Desert Inn filming "Rush Hour II" with Jackie Chan, Mr. Barnes said he was worried that a tax cut would come at the expense of AIDS research and other programs. A tax cut "sounds great," he said, "but the people who are disenfranchised are going to suffer."
"The swing goes up and down," Mr. Barnes said of the economy. "I think it'll moderate by the summer. Until I actually see it, I'm not sure what the doom and gloom is about."
Mr. Barnes was not gambling or throwing his money around, though he did do a little shopping at Caesars. "Me, being in the business I'm in, I know to be cautious," he said. "We're facing a strike in June or July, so I know to watch myself." Both screenwriters and actors may go on strike this summer.
Two women at the gaming tables expressed concern about the economy. Neither would give her full name. One of them, Marie, 34, who works at a high-technology firm in Houston, said she was limiting her losses to $200 because she worried about her money and investments.
Still, she said the only tax cut she supported was the repeal of the so-called marriage penalty tax. "I'm not in favor of the repeal of the estate tax or Bush's tax cuts," she said. "It will take too long to filter down to the lower end of the economic spectrum."
Several casinogoers said they were watching their losses, but as a matter of course, not as a reaction to the negative economic indicators.
Bonnie and John Johnson of Orange County, Calif., visiting Las Vegas for a cheerleading tournament in which their son Craig was scheduled to compete, said they were playing nickel slots and planned to keep it that way.
"We're not high rollers," Ms. Johnson said. "But it's not because we're worried about the economy. It's a little concerning because a friend of our son's just got laid off in San Francisco. But we think the economy is pretty good."
Mr. Johnson, who installs computer systems for Los Angeles County, said he favored a tax cut, but his wife disagreed. "I'd prefer that that money be used to pay down the deficit," she said.

HEADLINE: White House Memo; 
For the New President, a Chance to Take Back, and Keep, the Limelight

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Until Inauguration Day last month, tourists lingering outside the gates of the White House had the choice of having their photograph taken next to a life-size, cardboard picture of Bill Clinton or his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
 They still have a choice -- between the new cardboard cutout of President Bush and the old one of Mr. Clinton, whose specter won't leave the White House and whose likeness won't leave the sidewalk on Pennsylvania Avenue. 
 So far, Mr. Bush's aides insist that the endless soap opera of Mr. Clinton's exit has posed little problem for Mr. Bush. Yes, they say, the constant stream of chatter about Mr. Clinton's last-minute pardons hogged the airtime, commanding far more discussion about how much it cost to lobby the previous occupant of the White House for a cut in jail time than how much it costs to lobby the current one for a corporate tax break. 
But so far, one of Mr. Bush's top aides insisted last week, "the absence of attention on us has only helped." After a pause, the aide added, "That may be all over on Tuesday night."
In fact, there is concern in the White House now that the honeymoon, while not ending, is beginning to wind down. Suddenly, President Bush finds himself facing a series of real issues, from Iraq to his first unpleasant exchange with China to a budget that Democrats will begin picking at this week. 
Mr. Bush's speech on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, while technically billed only as a "budget message," will look, feel and sound like a State of the Union address. It is certainly being written that way.
And no sooner will it be over, Mr. Bush's aides fear, than the story will turn to one of haggling over real numbers, over the sensitive question of who benefits from the Bush tax cut and over Mr. Bush's assertions that Americans can have it all -- tax cuts, deficit reduction and even new spending.
"There is more than enough room for the tax cut of the size the president's proposed," Mitch Daniels, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said today as he made his way from televised talk show to talk show, offering glimpses of the budget numbers Mr. Bush will begin to specify this week.
 He added that Mr. Bush's $1.6 trillion tax cut plan over 10 years would allow the government to "pay down all the debt that is available to be paid down."
 That is a new formulation the Bush administration is using now that it has discovered, to its joy, that upwards of $800 billion of $3.4 trillion in debt held by the public cannot be redeemed in the next decade because it is held in savings bonds or treasury bills that do not come due any time soon, or are held by foreign governments.
 Mr. Bush has many tasks on Tuesday night. He must make the case for the tax cut, overcoming Democratic arguments that it is too big, too skewed toward the rich and too dependent on budget surpluses that may fade away as the economy slows.
 He must satisfy the right wing of his party, which has always pressed for smaller government, while defending increases for the Education Department, which a few years ago Republicans wanted to wipe out. (Even the Energy Department will be getting a small increase, despite the fact that the new energy secretary, Spencer Abraham, sponsored legislation when he was in the Senate to do away with the whole department.)
 Mr. Bush must also gather support from the business community, which helped get him elected and is now screaming that it gets little out of the White House tax cut proposals. In fact, its perks may be curbed: While the White House has said little about what will be cut in the president's budget, Mr. Daniels and other officials suggested today that loans, guarantees and credit insurance provided by the Export-Import Bank of the United States might be a tempting target.
Such a cut would bring howls of protest from some of America's largest corporations. They obtain the loans and guarantees when selling products abroad. Boeing, for example, routinely uses the government-sponsored bank to finance aircraft purchases by foreign airlines.
But in speeches like this, style always leaves a more lingering impression than statistics. And while the White House is discouraging any comparisons, lurking behind Mr. Bush will be that cardboard cutout of Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Clinton's eight annual appearances before a joint session of Congress ranked among his favorite rituals. 
When he was in trouble, which was more often than not, the speech was also a way to command authority, to take back the platform. 
 Mr. Bush, who does not relish speeches in formal settings, has something of the same task at hand. Some of his aides worry that he still does not seem to fill the room when he speaks, and, more specifically, that he seems to have a hard time making the case for his tax cut. 
He has made some progress, they insist when speaking on background to reporters, by arguing that the economic slowdown will last if the Federal Reserve's moves to lower interest rates are not matched by a $1.6 trillion tax cut, a figure he declared last week was "just right."
 But his renewed emphasis in recent days on paying down the national debt, something he rarely discussed during the presidential campaign, amounts to a tacit acknowledgment that Mr. Clinton's repeated calls for "fiscal discipline" were politically effective. 
And while Mr. Clinton's reputation and legacy have been tarnished in recent weeks, it is not yet clear that Americans are willing to abandon his economic strategy.
Mr. Bush's advisers, however, think the best strategy is to get on with the Bush plan with as little protracted argument as possible.
"We know we are going to cut taxes, so why wait?" an impatient-sounding Paul H. O'Neill, the new treasury secretary, asked a few weeks ago. "Once we've decided what we are going to do, what's the advantage of spending a lot of time doing it?"

HEADLINE: Powell, Meeting Both Sides in Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, Makes Little Headway 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: KUWAIT CITY, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell stepped into the middle of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict today, traveling in an armored van from the elegant King David Hotel in Jerusalem through a barbed-wire crossing into the economic bleakness of the West Bank. 
 At the hotel, General Powell stood in a wood-paneled room alongside another retired general, the Israeli prime minister-elect, Ariel Sharon, and listened to tough talk: no negotiations "under pressure of violence and terror." 
 In Ramallah, at the whitewashed headquarters of Yasir Arafat, General Powell heard similar arguments from the Palestinian leader, making his first appearance at his West Bank office since the latest violence started five months ago. 
The secretary of state made little headway in breaking the logjam. Negotiations toward peace were a long way off -- down the end of a long, locked hallway, he said -- and the situation had unraveled so much that "the best we can hope for in the short term is a reduction in the level of violence." 
Even that was far from a certainty. "Who puts the first key in the door and starts to turn the lock" was still a difficult challenge, he said. 
The general was baptized into the hardening conflict on the second day of a three-day trip largely dedicated to shaping one of the Bush administration's highest foreign policy priorities: more sharply focused sanctions against the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, and rebuilding badly needed Arab support for them. 
So far, the general has found that although he represents a new administration with a more favorable reputation in the Arab world than the last one, his efforts to contain Mr. Hussein are complicated by hostility in the region toward what is seen as American backing of Israel against the Palestinians. 
The detour into Israel and the Palestinian territories gave General Powell a chance to assess two leaders, whom he says he knew years ago, and to figure out how close the Bush administration should get to a conflict that was a driving force of Middle East policy in the Clinton White House.
After meeting the two leaders, General Powell offered some candid assessments to reporters traveling with him. Mr. Arafat had changed little, he said. "He held to positions he has held all along," the general said, after the nearly 90-minute encounter. "The conversation was brisk on a number of occasions."
"Did I see someone I'd never seen before?" he added. "No."
Mr. Sharon, on the other hand, the general said, was very thoughtful, realized the "enormity of the problem at hand," and was aware that "many remembered him from another day," apparently a reference to Israel's own finding that Mr. Sharon was indirectly involved in the killings in two Palestinian refugee camps outside Beirut during Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. 
Asked if Mr. Sharon was a conservative leader who could make a significant breakthrough with the Palestinians, as Nixon had with China, General Powell replied: "It would be wild speculation that we are in that kind of mode. This is the Middle East."
The journey from Jerusalem to the West Bank, over a circuitous back road for security reasons, was the general's first into Palestinian territory, and one that gave him a view through his tinted window of the contrast between the well-being on the Israeli side and a flailing economy on the Palestinian side. 
On the way out of the West Bank to the Tel Aviv airport, the general traveled on a main, four-lane Israeli road that carried only light traffic because of the government's closing of entry points into the West Bank.
General Powell said he had never seen the Israeli settlements around the eastern area of Jerusalem and was taken aback at how "closely packed it all is" and how "difficult it is to sort out the whole situation."
In his breakfast meeting with Mr. Sharon, the general heard the Israeli leader outline the moves the Palestinians must make before the Israelis would consider easing the economic noose they had placed on the Palestinian Authority.
Mr. Sharon was demanding that Mr. Arafat make a public statement in Arabic over Palestinian media outlets renouncing violence and telling his people that it must stop, Israeli officials said. Mr. Arafat had pledged to do that at a conference led by President Clinton in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt, in October, but the Palestinian leader had failed to do so, they said. The Israelis were also said to be waiting for some "practical steps" by Mr. Arafat showing that he had instructed his militia members to stop their activities.
Asked if Mr. Arafat could control the Arab violence -- a question that plagued the Clinton administration -- General Powell suggested that Mr. Arafat might be able to do more. "He certainly has some level of control over much of the activity," he said. "The question is -- is he exercising as much control as he can? That remains to be seen." 
For his part, Mr. Arafat complained to General Powell that he was under such restrictions from the Israelis that he had to borrow a helicopter from King Abdullah of Jordan to fly to his West Bank headquarters. 
"They are preventing me from using my own helicopter," Mr. Arafat said. At particular issue for the Palestinians is $57 million in tax revenues from sales of goods to Palestinians shopping in Israel, as well as from customs duties, that the Israeli government is withholding in what it says is punishment for Palestinian violence. The State Department has asked the Israelis to release the money so the Palestinian Authority can meet its January payroll for civil servants and security officers.
General Powell said he had not pressed Mr. Sharon on the tax revenues because it was clear from their conversation that he would not act in a "rising spiral of violence."
One of the most obvious gaps between Mr. Arafat and the Israelis -- and the Bush administration -- was the Palestinian leader's insistence with the general that peace talks should be resumed at the point where they left off at the end of the Clinton presidency.
The Bush White House has disavowed the proposals put forward by President Clinton, saying they belong to him and no one else. But Mr. Arafat, standing alongside General Powell, said that "no government can basically erase the work of the previous government."
Pointing to the depth of distrust between the two sides, General Powell said he had discovered that exploratory contacts over improving security were so touch and go that he had little confidence they would materialize. "Whether they will bear fruit or not, I don't know," he said. "So many previous starts have not led anywhere."
 --------------------

Israel to Halt Gaza Stops
 JERUSALEM, Feb. 25, (Reuters) -- The Israeli Army announced today that it would remove military checkpoints dividing the Gaza Strip just hours after General Powell urged Israel to lift its "siege" of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The army said it had reversed its decision, made after a mortar attack on a Jewish settlement on Friday, to cut Gaza into two sections because of "increasing humanitarian cases and requests for passage between the two parts."
Israel has cited security reasons for closing off Palestinian territories, but Palestinians call the measures "collective punishment" and say they are choking their economy.

PERSON: Elaine L. Chao 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Family History Forges Labor Secretary's Convictions

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
JUST weeks into her new job as secretary of labor, Elaine L. Chao is reluctant to discuss pressing issues she faces, like new safety regulations meant to reduce ergonomic injuries in the workplace. 
 "I'm still in the process of reviewing them," she said. 
 Expanding the guest worker programs elicited a similar response: "That's only a small part of the question about the major demographic shift coming in the next decades when we will face a shortage of workers." 
But on the question of affirmative action, which touches many programs her department oversees, Ms. Chao speaks comfortably and expansively. She favors outreach and access, she said, not racial quotas or numerical goals, a position that is not only a cornerstone of her political philosophy but also the essential lesson she has drawn from growing up as a Chinese-American. 
"I was very lucky to grow up in a family that believed in hard work and education," she said, recounting her family's story, which begins with her parents leaving war-torn China and explodes with success after success when they reach America. Prosperity for her father's shipping firm. The honor of five of the six Chao daughters receiving degrees from Harvard. The fame of the eldest, Elaine, now 47 years old, being appointed to President Bush's cabinet. 
"The American philosophy is equal opportunity for everyone, but you can't guarantee results," she said. "We are a meritocracy."
As an Asian-American who believes affirmative action has held back her community rather than helped it, Ms. Chao believes her family's life is a testimony to the value of rising on merit and education. "One of my things is to help promote and encourage workers to get into the practice of lifelong learning," she said. 
Her father, James Chao, sailed from Shanghai as an apprentice merchant seaman in 1949 but never returned after Mao Zedong's forces carried out the Chinese revolution. Instead he settled in Taiwan, where he met and married her mother, Ruth, another Chinese refugee. Seven years later James moved to Long Island, where he worked three jobs to prepare for his family's arrival when Elaine was 8 years old.
"Growing up with their stories gave me a tremendous appreciation for the sacrifice of my parents," Ms. Chao said. "The story of China is one disaster after another."
Once the Chao family settled in America, there were few disasters except racial discrimination. Speaking no English on her first day at school, Ms. Chao was accompanied by her father, who instructed her to greet the teacher. A respectful 8-year-old, she bowed from her waist and heard the laughter of her schoolmates. 
"I know what discrimination is," she said. 
Within two years, however, she was elected her class president. With her father reviewing her work, Ms. Chao rapidly adapted to American life. "As the eldest, I was a child with a heightened sense of responsibility," she said. 
She earned an economics degree from Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass., and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. Under President Ronald Reagan she served as deputy maritime administrator and then chairwoman of the Federal Maritime Commission. Under President George Bush she rose to deputy secretary of the Department of Transportation and then director of the Peace Corps. After the Republicans lost the White House, she became president of the United Way of America, reviving the charity from a scandal with her trademark optimism and hard work.
Then Ms. Chao was recruited to serve on an alumni board for Harvard. That experience, Ms. Chao said, showed her how Harvard's racial goals for admission meant that Asian-Americans were held back. Even though Asian-Americans had the highest test scores and highest grade-point averages, she said, they had the lowest admission rate because the school did not want to go over its goals for Asian-Americans.
(In December 2000, when Harvard admitted 1,105 new students on an early basis for the new freshman class, 18.4 percent were Asian-American, 7.2 percent were Hispanic, 6.1 percent were African-American and 0.8 percent were Native Americans, according to the school's admissions office.)
"The goal concept means you'll be subject to a higher standard of achievement for admission," said Ms. Chao, defining the particular glass ceiling and racial discrimination her community has faced since Asians first came to this country. 
Ms. Chao brought her grievances to the national arena in 1997 during an Oval Office meeting on race relations with President Bill Clinton. While acknowledging the good intentions of affirmative action, she asked him, "What happens when good programs in the process hurt other people?"
SHORTLY after Ms. Chao took over the United Way she married Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and a leading conservative in Congress.
His influence could be felt at the Labor Department, where Ms. Chao has hired his former chief of staff and press secretary to perform those jobs for her.
"My husband has one of the subtlest political minds in the country," she said. "I'm interested in finding the best people, and I can't help it if I'm poaching from his staff." 
As one half of Washington's newest power couple, Ms. Chao says she has learned the price of steady striving and achievement. A few years ago she became a fellow at the Heritage Foundation in part to slow down the pace of life and start a family. It didn't work, and she was unable to have child.
"Women think they can order their lives in a sequence, but sometimes nature doesn't cooperate," she said. "That was an important lesson for me."

HEADLINE: Essay; 
Retrograde Movement

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
George W. Bush's foreign policy so far has made three mistakes and missed one opportunity. 
 1. Pretending the easing of economic pressure on Iraq is the imposition of "smart sanctions." Apparently Bush has decided to cave in to France, Russia and Syria and permit resumption of business-as-usual with Saddam Hussein. The trick is to acquiesce while looking fierce; hence our pinprick bombing of radar sites. 
 Although the mission was to "degrade" rather than destroy Iraqi air defense, all it degraded was our air force technology's reputation for accuracy. Bush claimed success, however, in another mission -- "to get his attention." Saddam got the message, all right: Bush the Younger's technique is to conceal a retreat from an inadequately enforced sanctions policy in a loud hail of ineffectual bombs. 
We will now have what the administration labels "smart sanctions" -- that is, few if any penalties for defying the world as Saddam uses new oil revenues to build his germ-war weapon in secret. What Bush thinks is smart about this sanctions policy is that it shows the world he can retreat -- engage in a "retrograde movement" is the military euphemism -- with head held high. 
2. Bowing to Blair. The British prime minister wanted a Washington meeting to endorse Bush's take-that-you-cad slap at Saddam and to shore up ratings in his election campaign against resurgent Conservatives. The deal to be done is for Britain to lead Europe into cooperation with America's inexorable adoption of missile defense; in return, the U.S. would allow Britain to persuade us that the independent European rapid reaction force, so eagerly sought by France, would not undercut the Atlantic Alliance. 
What happened at Bush's first summit meeting? He gave Blair what he wanted, embracing the non-American force, and in return -- when it came to British support for missile defense -- got from Blair only a medium hello. Abandoning U.S. interests in negotiation makes Bush likable to foreign leaders, but let's hope Vladimir Putin doesn't show up at Camp David before our man gets his sea legs. 
3. Undermining Israel's response to the war being waged against its existence. After Palestinians rejected the Clinton-Barak plan to divide Jerusalem (thereby revealing that their hunger would not be satisfied until Arabs "returned" to take over all of Israel), Yasir Arafat's war of terror escalated. 
The Bush reaction to the organized guerrilla war against Israel has been to pretend that both sides are at fault. Clinton-like, he calls for "an end to violence" -- as if the victims of terror were as culpable as those instigating and sustaining it. Such serene evenhandedness in the face of aggression is as strategically foolish as it is morally wrong. 
Israel's caretaker government is trying to limit its reaction to Arab bombings and lethal bus-driver rampages to a strict but nonviolent blockade. Even this restraint is not enough for our State Department, still dominated by the same Clinton crowd that brought us the giveaway peace process that started a war. 
Bush's holdover ambassador in Tel Aviv, even as Colin Powell arrived for his first visit, stated as the U.S. position: "We urge the Israelis to cease their policies of economic pressure against the Palestinians." 
What is Bush suggesting by this -- greater military retaliation? Hardly. Does he propose no Israeli pressure in response to a systematic killing of Jews? Apparently so. Before buying into Appeasement Now, the visiting Powell would do well to read Barbara Amiel's powerful piece in London's Daily Telegraph about Israel's importance to the survival of Judaism. 
4. Failing to respond dramatically to a friend in trouble. Turkey is a secular, Muslim, NATO ally. Its Incirlik base makes possible our patrol of a no-fly zone in Iraq, which protects Iraqi Kurds from genocide. But political strife has led to a financial crisis and investors are fleeing. 
Colin Powell in full panoply is in the neighborhood. Couldn't he extend his trip by one well-photographed day to assure Ankara of our confidence, which would do much more for Turkish stability than Bush's phone call? Is he so frozen into a schedule that he cannot seize the moment? 
This has not been a propitious foreign-policy beginning. Closer attention is needed to right the ship.

HEADLINE: 10 Years Later, Hussein Is Firmly in Control 

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Ten years ago, Saddam Hussein looked at least in the view of the American-led military alliance that defeated his forces in Kuwait -- every inch a finished man, another discredited dictator heading for the ignominy of history's rubbish heap.
 After a 43-day air and land war, the Iraqi ruler's occupation forces were in headlong retreat, perhaps 50,000 of his troops dead, his military and intelligence infrastructure reduced to rubble, his self-proclaimed image as man of steel shattered like his bombed-out palaces, and American advance battalions halted, deeply frustrated, only a few hours' drive from Baghdad. 
 What a difference a decade makes.
On Monday, Kuwait will reach the climax of celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of the end of its occupation. Among those attending will be former President George Bush, who assembled the allied force, saw it through to Kuwait's liberation on Feb. 27, 1991, then decided not to press on to Baghdad to topple Mr. Hussein. 
The hope, then, was that the Iraqi ruler would fall of his own dead weight, weakened by a constricting regime of United Nations sanctions and rejected by a people he had already ruled for nearly 12 years.
But in Baghdad, in February 2001, almost nothing is as Mr. Bush and other leaders of the gulf war alliance hoped.
Mr. Hussein, now 63, is as firmly in power in this nation of 23 million people as ever, and just as harsh in defense of his power, according to human rights reports chronicling the parade of opponents, would-be assassins and "traitors" into Iraq's prisons, and on with chilling regularity to the firing squad or gallows.
Although large swaths of the north and south of his country are no-flight zones patrolled, and sometimes bombed, by American and British warplanes, Saddam Hussein has successfully resisted any United Nations inspection of his suspected effort to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons since December 1998. Baghdad is rebuilt with glittering new palaces and state guesthouses, imposing new statues of Mr. Hussein and scaffolding cladding the few bombed-out government buildings not yet restored.
At one statue today, outside a new 680-foot concrete communications tower in central Baghdad built to replace one obliterated by a 1998 American air attack, self-consciously enthusiastic Iraqis clustered for photographs before a 30-foot bronze casting of Mr. Hussein, a pistol at his hip, a military beret on his head, his right arm thrusting forward as if commanding a new assault.
The statue, like others around Baghdad, has become a favorite stop for Iraqi wedding parties -- a place to get photographs for the mantle that can testify to a family's loyalty to Mr. Hussein.
On the statue's plinth are what are said to be tangled fragments of the Tomahawk cruise missiles that struck the earlier tower. At Mr. Hussein's feet, bronze images, each the size of a bread plate, show former President Bush, Margaret Thatcher, Britain's prime minister at the time of the Kuwait invasion, and Francois Mitterrand, the French president whose forces also joined the war.
Elsewhere in Baghdad, there is another story -- of children begging wretchedly for their families in the street, of former engineers and high school teachers selling cheap clothing and spit-roasted kebabs off handcarts and rusting bed frames for the equivalent of $2 a day, of wards where patients, including tiny children, lie dying for want of medicines and life-support machines. All of this, the Iraqis say, is symptomatic of how a decade of sanctions has reduced the people of this country, at least those lacking the privileges of a pampered elite, to lives of destitution.
But for the moment, the mood Mr. Hussein's loyalists seem keen to promote is one of triumphalism, more than hand wringing for the deprived. In effect, those loyalists say, Mr. Hussein has wrung victory from defeat (a word they never use) by defying the sanctions, by refusing to bow to the United States, by remaining in power long after his gulf war adversaries have retired, or died. Mr. Hussein, the loyalists say, has never flinched, and never will flinch, before American power.
"We've resisted for 10 years, we've survived, we've rebuilt our country without financial aid, sanctions are crumbling and there are no foreign armies on our soil," said Nasira al-Sadoon, editor in chief of the state-owned Baghdad Observer. "We stood alone, against an alliance of more than 30 armies, a third world country against the world's greatest superpower, and it is they who have been defeated, not us. We are very proud of ourselves."
Mr. Hussein himself has been silent in recent days, apparently content with the rambling speech he gave in January, when Iraq marked the war's start with a military parade that showed off some of its new tanks and rockets and rebuilt army battalions.
The Iraqi ruler, using the language of the Koran, spoke of the war for Kuwait as one in which Iraq, "representing those who defend right against falsehood," confronted the Western and Arab allies, whom he described as "the debased, the enemies of Allah, and those who had Satan as a protector."
For years, Iraq has said that a million people died in the war -- almost certainly a huge exaggeration, but a staple of Iraqi propaganda. According to an official translation of his speech, Mr. Hussein proclaimed all who died martyrs, saying: "Much dear blood of the dear ones was shed. But they have become the flagstaff of the banner proclaiming, 'Allah is the Greatest.' They have become the candles that dispel darkness before the march of great Iraq, for generations after generations, and whenever darkness tries to veil Iraq's luminous march." 
He added, "Thus Iraq has remained, the people have remained, the army has remained."
By the standard of some of his acolytes, Mr. Hussein's was the moderate view. In remarks that seemed aimed at drawing support among hard-liners in the ruling Baath Party, Uday Hussein, Mr. Hussein's 36-year-old man-about-town eldest son, took up the issue of Kuwait in a working paper he presented in Parliament in November, demanding that the map of Iraq on the Legislature's emblem be changed to show Kuwait as part of Iraq.
Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister who conducted many negotiations for Iraq before, during and after the occupation of Kuwait, backed the proposal -- an act unthinkable without being sure of Saddam Hussein's support. "Iraq was the victim of a conspiracy against its sovereignty and national interest, and Kuwait was part and parcel of that conspiracy," Mr. Aziz said amid the Iraqi celebrations marking the start of the war. "So Kuwait got what it deserved in 1990."
The instinct for attack, at least in polemical terms, has been encouraged in recent days by what Mr. Hussein appears to have taken as a sign of American weakness: the decision by President Bush -- routinely referred to in Baghdad's propaganda as "the son of a viper," or "little Bush" -- to muster new consensus for a fresh version of the United Nations sanctions.
The American aim is apparently to address concern that existing sanctions are responsible, as Iraq has claimed, for widespread deaths from disease and malnutrition, despite the oil-for-food program that allows Iraq to sell oil for vital food and medical supplies, while maintaining a tight arms embargo that would prevent, or at least inhibit, Iraq from developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
In recent months, one gulf war ally after another -- among them, close American allies like France, Turkey and Saudi Arabia -- have denounced the sanctions, and often openly flouted them. At least a dozen countries have broken the air embargo by flying planes belonging to their national carriers into Baghdad, and three, Egypt, Jordan and Syria, have begun scheduled flights. Each flight has been met with fanfare at the Baghdad airport.
About the only aspect of the sanctions controversy on which Iraq and the United Nations officials who enforce sanctions agree is that Iraq has had permission to spend $9.6 billion under the oil-for-food program, but that a larger sum -- $13 billion of Iraq's oil revenue -- has been spent on reparations to Kuwait, payments to members of the coalition that defeated Iraq and on United Nations costs.
Beyond that, everything is disputed, particularly the number of people who have died as a result of sanctions. Iraq claims the total is 1.5 million -- including 500,000 children; United Nations officials and State Department reports dispute that as exaggerated, and say that Iraqi officials have cynically exploited the sanctions by diverting imported food to government loyalists, or even smuggling it back out of Iraq for re-sale elsewhere, and by going months without ordering any medicines at all.
At the Saddam Children's Hospital on the eastern outskirts of Baghdad, a dark, brooding place that has become the prime stop on the Information Ministry's guided tours, few doctors, patients or relatives seem much interested in the debate over who -- Iraq, the United States or the United Nations -- is responsible. All they see is the abject standards, the lack of basic medicines, the primitive levels of hygiene, the absence of equipment.
The pediatric intensive-care ward, filled with children dying of leukemia, meningitis and other diseases, is Dickensian, with sobbing mothers, a putrid smell, and a pervasive sense of hopelessness.
To listen to Iraqi officials, all this has reinforced popular support for Mr. Hussein. But to a visitor returning to Baghdad for the first time since December 1990, on the eve of the gulf war, there is an air that seems different.
In 1990, fear among ordinary people was palpable. Today, although every conversation in the presence of government-assigned minders produces routine expressions of admiration for Saddam Hussein, there are hints in unmonitored conversations -- irreverent jokes about statues, talk of a "different" and "free" Iraq within 5 or 10 years -- that suggest at least stirrings of dissent.
How to build on such subtleties to press for political change, while relieving the miseries of ordinary Iraqis, remains a complex quandary for Washington and London. But outsiders who know Iraq well say that the sanctions -- by reducing many Iraqis to levels of bare subsistence and adding to Mr. Hussein's formidable powers that of bestowing scarce necessities -- have strengthened, not weakened, Iraq's ruler.
A high-level official in a neighboring Arab country, a man who knows Mr. Hussein personally, said that this should motivate Washington to ease the sanctions, or even abandon them. 
"You've made Saddam the underdog, and that's been an inestimable gift," the official said. "If the aim was to bring Saddam down, you should listen to Iraqis, who will tell you that without sanctions the Saddam regime would never have survived."

HEADLINE: Trying to Tame the Roar of Deadly Lakes 

BYLINE:  By MARGUERITE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
On the evening of Aug. 21, 1986, a cloud of carbon dioxide erupted from Lake Nyos in the mountainous region of northwestern Cameroon. Heavy and deadly, the gas rolled down hills, into valleys and villages, suffocating everything in its path. By the next morning, 1,700 people were dead.
 Because of that eruption, and a 1984 emission at Lake Monoun 59 miles to the southeast, the people of the region have lived with the fear that these lakes will kill again. Indeed, both lakes contain more lethal gas than they did before the eruptions. 
 But now, an international team of scientists has taken the first steps to disarm the killer lakes.
By lowering a polyethylene pipe into the depths of Lake Nyos, the scientists have allowed gas-rich water at the bottom of the lake to froth up in a great fountain. The carbon dioxide, generated by volcanic activity deep in the earth, can now escape harmlessly into the atmosphere rather than building up under pressure and, ultimately, exploding.
"This will be the first time we will have been able to prevent a natural disaster," said Dr. James G. Smith, a geoscience adviser at the federal Agency for International Development, which paid for most of the effort. He called it "truly amazing."
In addition to placing the first of what the scientists hope will be a series of de-gassing pipes, they have installed an early warning system on each lake. If levels of carbon dioxide rise, sirens and strobes will go off and people in the region can try to escape.
"The Nyos people seem very happy," Dr. Gregory Tanyileke of the Cameroonian Institute for Geological and Mining Research said from a satellite phone at the lake shore. "It is the end of a nightmare for them."
Although scientists are pleased so far, they note that the danger is far from over. Lake Nyos still contains enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, and one pipe alone will not be enough to remove it.
The team would like to put four or five more pipes in Nyos to eliminate the hazard there and to install pipes in Monoun, which remains extremely dangerous. Team members estimate that they need $2 million, but they have no immediate money source.
Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun are crater lakes, formed as cooled volcanic craters filled with water. In most such lakes, any gas that enters from underground sources eventually reaches the atmosphere when layers of water in the lakes periodically mix from top to bottom or turn over, said Dr. George W. Kling, a University of Michigan biologist who has studied Nyos and Monoun and is one of the leaders of the de-gassing team.
But these two lakes, along with Lake Kivu in East Africa, which has not erupted, are unusual. The boundary, called the chemocline, between the deep water, rich with gas and minerals, and the fresh upper water stays intact. Gas saturates the bottom water and stays trapped there, like the carbon dioxide in a sealed bottle of seltzer.
Then something -- perhaps a strong wind, cool weather, a storm or a landslide -- causes a pocket of upper water to sink. That movement, in turn, provokes some bottom water to rise. Without the weight of the water above to contain it, the gas comes out of solution, like the bubbles that emerge when a seltzer bottle is opened.
In the case of Lake Nyos in 1986, the jet of gas and water shot up about 260 feet, Dr. Kling said. Moving at about 45 miles an hour, the gas reached villages 12 miles away. The lake released about a cubic kilometer of carbon dioxide -- about 10 football stadiums full, from the field to the top of the bleachers, Dr. Kling said. At Lake Monoun, the cloud was much smaller, but still deadly. It killed 37 people as they walked to work early one morning.
The 672-foot pipe installed last month in Lake Nyos takes some of the pressure off. It spews a jet of gas and water that rises as high as 165 feet. Over the course of a year, it will release about 706 million cubic feet of gas, said Dr. Michel Halbwachs of the University of Savoy in France, who directed the installation and led an initial de-gassing test in 1995.
That amount of gas is about three or four times as much as is thought to enter the lake in that time, said Dr. Kling. Lake Nyos contains 10.6 billion cubic feet to 14.1 billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide -- 16,000 times the amount in an average lake, he added.
The lake and the pipe will be monitored with sensors to see if any change occurs in the stratification of the water. Such a change could set off another explosion. If everything works properly, the information will be transmitted weekly to France by satellite. "If there is something worrisome, we can activate the valves from France, exactly as if we were on the shores of the lake," Dr. Halbwachs said.
Those valves are high up in the pipe, and can open to allow water that is less gaseous to enter the column. This influx of more stable, less gaseous water reduces the force of the fountain and, if all valves are opened, stops the flow altogether. Once Cameroonian researchers have been fully trained, they will do all the monitoring and control from a lakeside observatory and science center that is under construction.
Although the scientists who have worked on this problem for many years say they are pleased with the success of the first pipe, they remain worried.
The CO2 sirens, which are used on volcanoes around the world because they emit deadly gases, will help. "But in terms of mitigating all the danger to the people around the lake, I don't feel good about it," said William C. Evans, a chemist with the United States Geological Survey who would like to see more pipes installed in Nyos soon.
In addition to the pent-up carbon dioxide, Nyos contains another hazard that has not been tackled: a weak dam at its northern edge. If the dam ruptured, it could cause a gas eruption and a flood that could flow as far as Nigeria, drowning or displacing up to 10,000 people.
"I am now a bit more concerned about that erosion than about the gas," said Umaru Sule, who survived the Nyos disaster but lost most of his family, and who now lives in Oklahoma, where he just completed his master's in agricultural education. "They should try to maybe see how they could reinforce the dam."
Mr. Sule's concerns may be addressed this spring. Dr. Halbwachs of the University of Savoy said a team of five scientists from a French group called Hydrologists Without Borders was planning to visit Lake Nyos in April to see if the members could do just that.
"So far, so good," said Dr. Tanyileke of the Cameroonian geological institute. "It looks as if some of our dreams are finally coming true."

HEADLINE: Turkey's Precarious Success 

BYLINE:  By Robert D. Kaplan; Robert D. Kaplan, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, is author of "Eastward to Tartary: Travels in the Balkans, the Middle East and the Caucasus."

DATELINE: STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Late last week in Turkey, the stock market declined by 18 percent and the lira lost a third of its value. Interest rates have soared to several thousand percent, and inflation is around 30 percent. What reportedly scared away investors was a publicized argument between President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, whom the president had accused of being too lenient toward corrupt politicians. But that was merely the beginning of the crisis, not its underlying cause.
 The cause was the very fragility of Turkey's recent economic reforms and the boomlet they had created, sending market indexes up from 5,000 to nearly 20,000 points in 1999 and early 2000. Turkey is building modern democratic and financial institutions that provide stability, but building such institutions can be destabilizing in its own right. Turkey's problems are those of success, but that does not make its problems any less dangerous to American interests. 
 Turkey, along with Brazil, perhaps, is now the world's foremost example of a state whose institutions are struggling to keep up with modernization. The government bureaucracy remains mired in Ottoman lethargy. Some banks, burdened by foreign-currency debts and murky dealings, are close to collapse. Tax revenues are insufficiently distributed to the provinces where they are needed.
Meanwhile, the dramatic liberalization of the Turkish economy begun in 1983 by Turgut Ozal, the late prime minister, has created a vast new population of urban middle-class Turks, who are pressing for better public services.
Stability has so far been maintained by the National Security Council, a mixed regime of military officers and civilian ministers. For decades, this council has prevented Turkey from slipping into the anarchy of new democracies like Indonesia or the stifling autocracy of many nearby Arab states. Nevertheless, that stability has come at an increasing cost, especially as Turkey's society and class structure have become more complex.
The problem is this, simply put: No one in the system is accountable. Turkey's needs for responsive, transparent banking and taxation systems have grown. But who would establish them?
The military has no logical role, and anyway, avoids political responsibility for many problems.
But the politicians also avoid responsibility. They know that in a crisis the military will bail them out through subtle interventions that Turks have come to call "soft, post-modern coups." Such ultimate reliance on the military is what keeps Turkish politics immature, as evinced by the kind of temper tantrums thrown by the president and prime minister last week. 
Another reason that both violence and political breakdown have been avoided in Turkey is the very corruption that is partly responsible for the current crisis in the first place. As Samuel P. Huntington explains in his 1968 classic, "Political Order in Changing Societies," high levels of corruption are endemic to societies undergoing the stress of rapid modernization. Corruption greases the wheels of creaky, unresponsive bureaucracies, creates informal networks of power so that things get done when they otherwise wouldn't, and allows people to purchase power in third world systems that they would otherwise violently revolt against.
Turkey, however, is at the point where such corruption has outlived its usefulness and threatens an Asian-style financial meltdown. Any meltdown in Turkey, however, would be far more serious than an economic meltdown in, say, Indonesia. That's because a Turkish economic disaster would have geopolitical consequences for the United States far more severe than the various economic crises that have affected East Asia in recent years.
Turkey is the political organizing principle of the greater Middle East. It controls the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers that supply Syria and Iraq, and it is the economic lifeline for new democracies in the Caucasus. Any weakening of Turkey's borders would open up the entire nest of questions -- dormant since the end of World War I -- regarding the real frontiers of Syria, Iraq and other countries, all of which were artificially created in postwar peace agreements.
Indeed, the Turkish military has been a fundamental element in the Middle East balance of power. For instance, a new Turkish-Israeli military alliance helped pressure Syria into peace negotiations with Israel in the late 1990's.
A strong, stable Turkish government would be even more needed if Saddam Hussein were to fall. Without Mr. Hussein, Iraq would have few ways to damp down divisive tribal and sectarian conflict, and the country could fall into civil strife. In that event, a stable Turkey would be necessary to safeguard Iraq's northern border with the Kurds. 
Turkey, in other words, is not a country like Thailand, where an economic crisis has only financial repercussions for the United States. Turkey is more in the category of an Israel or Mexico: a place whose strategic importance is too great to allow the White House to trust the International Monetary Fund and other international bodies with the cleanup operation.
The Reagan administration did not leave Israel, when it was ridden with inflation, to its own devices; the United States intervened to restructure the Israeli economy. The Clinton administration took aggressive action, at significant political cost, to bail out Mexico.
Both policies were successes. The Bush administration has stated its reluctance to prop up countries in economic turmoil. But in the case of Turkey, it may find it has no choice but to directly chaperone the Turkish political system toward further modernization, so that the current financial crisis does not expand into a geopolitical one. In short, the Bush administration should see the Turkish financial crisis less as a financial crisis than as a political and strategic one.

HEADLINE: Bitter Strike At Domino Finally Ends 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Strikers at the mammoth Domino Sugar refinery in Brooklyn agreed yesterday to return to work, ending the city's longest labor battle in what even union leaders acknowledged was a stinging loss.
 The 20-month strike had become a major test for the local labor movement, with 284 workers holding out on the picket line for nine months at one of Brooklyn's few remaining large manufacturing operations. 
 But the strikers gradually started crossing the picket line, feeling abandoned by their parent union and the labor movement at large.
"It's a complete loss," acknowledged Joe Crimi, the chief negotiator for the strikers, who work at the 143-year-old refinery, a symbol of New York's onetime manufacturing might. 
Under the new contract, approved on Friday in a ratification vote by members of Local 1814 of the International Longshoremen's Association, Domino will be allowed to cut 110 jobs at the refinery. The three-year contract, union officials said, also provides for a one-time 5 percent raise on top of the workers' average weekly base pay of about $600.
For the first nine months of the strike, the 284 unionized workers showed extraordinary solidarity, without anyone crossing the picket line. But then they cracked, with workers crossing the picket line in fives and tens because their unemployment insurance had expired and because, they said, they were convinced that the walkout was making little headway. 
By last weekend, 104 former strikers had crossed the picket line, and the company insisted that production had long been back to normal. The workers who remained on strike felt so little hope that they voted 56 to 48 to approve the contract, which was little different from a management proposal that they unanimously rejected four months ago.
The strikers blamed their parent union for doing little for them -- it did not even provide strike benefits. They blamed the labor movement for turning its back on them by not rallying to their cause. They blamed their co-workers for crossing the picket line. And they accused the president of their union local of selling them out to put this embarrassing fight behind them.
"We got shafted," said Charles Milan, who has worked for 37 years in the refinery's packaging department. "We got stabbed in the back."
Domino Sugar, a division of Tate & Lyle, a British company that is one of the world's largest sweetener producers, praised the workers' decision to approve the contract.
In a news release, the company said the new agreement "provides substantial improvement in wages and benefits for union employees, and it also contains the operating flexibility which the company sought to improve competitiveness in the volatile U.S. cane sugar market."
The company repeatedly told the workers that it needed to reduce its work force because profits were down and because the company was starting to ship semiprocessed sugar to the Brooklyn refinery, rather than the traditional unrefined sugar.
"The resulting loss of some Brooklyn processing jobs has been eased by a generous enhanced severance package," the company said.
Jim McNamara, a spokesman for the International Longshoremen's Association, defended the role of the parent union, saying it gave the strikers generous support and even paid for union officials to travel to England to protest at a Tate & Lyle board meeting.
While company officials said it was time for union and management to work together, some workers acknowledged there would inevitably be tensions between those who crossed the picket line and those who remained on strike to the end. 
Charles Sekera, a machine operator, said he crossed the picket line last April, after being on strike for 10 months, because the strike was costing him a lot of money and because he was getting little information from his union.
"The union lost big-time," he said. "The union was out for more than a year and a half for nothing."
Denis Hughes, president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the strike seemed doomed from the start.
"It bothered me from the beginning that the union wasn't strong enough to put this together," he said. "It shows that even in the best of situations management has an enormous amount of power. One of the things we have to do better in the trade union movement is to develop strategies at the beginning of a dispute, instead of midway through."
Yesterday afternoon, the trailer that served as the center of the strike activities looked as if a hurricane had hit it. Empty Coke cans were everywhere, and the workers were tearing from the walls solidarity statements from other unions.
Hernando Gallego, a sugar boiler, conceded that he voted to approve management's proposal, saying, "I don't like the contract at all, but there's nothing to hold out for anymore."

MINEOLA: BUDGET SURPLUS PLANS -- Republican lawmakers in Nassau County want to reserve additional money to pay down debt and interest. More than half of the $48.3 million surplus from 2000 has been set aside, and Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader of the County Legislature, said that an additional $11.3 million in 2002 should be used to pay debt. Judith A. Jacobs, the Democratic majority leader, said the idea was "not new." A spokesman for County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta said most of the suggestions were already in the county's four-year plan.

MANHATTAN: KERIK MAKES ANOTHER ARREST -- For the third time since becoming the police commissioner less than a year ago, Bernard B. Kerik, left, took part in a street arrest. Mr. Kerik told reporters yesterday that he was driving around the Hamilton Heights section of Harlem on Sunday with his security detail when they noticed one man chasing another. When one man got into a van on West 142nd Street, Commissioner Kerik and others detained both men. They found that the van had been reported carjacked and arrested the two men on various charges, including unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. Diane Cardwell (NYT)

WHITE PLAINS: CELL PHONE BILL APPROVED -- The Westchester County Legislature, deciding not to wait for a statewide law, voted unanimously last night to prohibit drivers from talking on hand-held cellular phones. "We as local officials have an obligation to protect our own citizenry if we can't get the state to do it for us," said Louis Mosiello, the Republican sponsor of the bill. The measure would authorize fines of up to $150 for using a phone while driving unless it can be operated hands-free or is used in an emergency. The law would go into effect 45 days after the bill was signed by County Executive Andrew J. Spano, who says he supports it. (AP)

EAST ISLIP: ARRAIGNMENT IN ANIMAL SACRIFICE -- Six people were arraigned yesterday on charges that they illegally sacrificed a pig late Sunday during a religious rite at the East Islip Marina. Officials said the six were practicing a religion similar to Santeria. Although a Supreme Court ruling protects animal sacrifices when performed as part of religious practice, law enforcement officials said the pig was not killed swiftly and cleanly, but slowly and painfully. The participants were therefore charged with a misdemeanor violation of the state's agriculture and markets law. Michael Cooper (NYT)

MANHATTAN: TOUR BUS DEMISE CHEERS MAYOR Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said good riddance yesterday to New York Apple Tours, the tour bus company that announced its permanent shutdown on Sunday. "It's a good idea that they went out of business," Mr. Giuliani said. "They were a very, very difficult operation." The red double-decker buses had been cited for more than 1,000 traffic violations. Last May, one of the company's buses struck and killed a man.

CONNECTICUT

HARTFORD: STATE ECONOMY SLOWS -- University of Connecticut professors said yesterday that reduced job growth, falling consumer confidence and higher energy prices are slowing the state's 10-year economic expansion. In a report, the economists criticized what they called an anachronistic government that made statewide strategies for managing growth more difficult. But they said the state's two casinos had produced many new jobs. (NYT)

STAMFORD: SKAKEL HEARING DELAYED -- A hearing on whether to move the murder trial of Michael Skakel, left, has been pushed back a day, to Thursday, State Superior Court announced yesterday. Judge John F. Kavanewsky Jr. is to hear arguments from prosecutors, who want the trial moved to Bridgeport, and from the defense, which is opposed. (AP)

HEADLINE: Trying to Tame the Roar of Deadly Lakes 

BYLINE:  By MARGUERITE HOLLOWAY

 BODY:
On the evening of Aug. 21, 1986, a cloud of carbon dioxide erupted from Lake Nyos in the mountainous region of northwestern Cameroon. Heavy and deadly, the gas rolled down hills, into valleys and villages, suffocating everything in its path. By the next morning, 1,700 people were dead.
 Because of that eruption, and a 1984 emission at Lake Monoun 59 miles to the southeast, the people of the region have lived with the fear that these lakes will kill again. Indeed, both lakes contain more lethal gas than they did before the eruptions. 
 But now, an international team of scientists has taken the first steps to disarm the killer lakes.
By lowering a polyethylene pipe into the depths of Lake Nyos, the scientists have allowed gas-rich water at the bottom of the lake to froth up in a great fountain. The carbon dioxide, generated by volcanic activity deep in the earth, can now escape harmlessly into the atmosphere rather than building up under pressure and, ultimately, exploding.
"This will be the first time we will have been able to prevent a natural disaster," said Dr. James G. Smith, a geoscience adviser at the federal Agency for International Development, which paid for most of the effort. He called it "truly amazing."
In addition to placing the first of what the scientists hope will be a series of de-gassing pipes, they have installed an early warning system on each lake. If levels of carbon dioxide rise, sirens and strobes will go off and people in the region can try to escape.
"The Nyos people seem very happy," Dr. Gregory Tanyileke of the Cameroonian Institute for Geological and Mining Research said from a satellite phone at the lake shore. "It is the end of a nightmare for them."
Although scientists are pleased so far, they note that the danger is far from over. Lake Nyos still contains enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, and one pipe alone will not be enough to remove it.
The team would like to put four or five more pipes in Nyos to eliminate the hazard there and to install pipes in Monoun, which remains extremely dangerous. Team members estimate that they need $2 million, but they have no immediate money source.
Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun are crater lakes, formed as cooled volcanic craters filled with water. In most such lakes, any gas that enters from underground sources eventually reaches the atmosphere when layers of water in the lakes periodically mix from top to bottom or turn over, said Dr. George W. Kling, a University of Michigan biologist who has studied Nyos and Monoun and is one of the leaders of the de-gassing team.
But these two lakes, along with Lake Kivu in East Africa, which has not erupted, are unusual. The boundary, called the chemocline, between the deep water, rich with gas and minerals, and the fresh upper water stays intact. Gas saturates the bottom water and stays trapped there, like the carbon dioxide in a sealed bottle of seltzer.
Then something -- perhaps a strong wind, cool weather, a storm or a landslide -- causes a pocket of upper water to sink. That movement, in turn, provokes some bottom water to rise. Without the weight of the water above to contain it, the gas comes out of solution, like the bubbles that emerge when a seltzer bottle is opened.
In the case of Lake Nyos in 1986, the jet of gas and water shot up about 260 feet, Dr. Kling said. Moving at about 45 miles an hour, the gas reached villages 12 miles away. The lake released about a cubic kilometer of carbon dioxide -- about 10 football stadiums full, from the field to the top of the bleachers, Dr. Kling said. At Lake Monoun, the cloud was much smaller, but still deadly. It killed 37 people as they walked to work early one morning.
The 672-foot pipe installed last month in Lake Nyos takes some of the pressure off. It spews a jet of gas and water that rises as high as 165 feet. Over the course of a year, it will release about 706 million cubic feet of gas, said Dr. Michel Halbwachs of the University of Savoy in France, who directed the installation and led an initial de-gassing test in 1995.
That amount of gas is about three or four times as much as is thought to enter the lake in that time, said Dr. Kling. Lake Nyos contains 10.6 billion cubic feet to 14.1 billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide -- 16,000 times the amount in an average lake, he added.
The lake and the pipe will be monitored with sensors to see if any change occurs in the stratification of the water. Such a change could set off another explosion. If everything works properly, the information will be transmitted weekly to France by satellite. "If there is something worrisome, we can activate the valves from France, exactly as if we were on the shores of the lake," Dr. Halbwachs said.
Those valves are high up in the pipe, and can open to allow water that is less gaseous to enter the column. This influx of more stable, less gaseous water reduces the force of the fountain and, if all valves are opened, stops the flow altogether. Once Cameroonian researchers have been fully trained, they will do all the monitoring and control from a lakeside observatory and science center that is under construction.
Although the scientists who have worked on this problem for many years say they are pleased with the success of the first pipe, they remain worried.
The CO2 sirens, which are used on volcanoes around the world because they emit deadly gases, will help. "But in terms of mitigating all the danger to the people around the lake, I don't feel good about it," said William C. Evans, a chemist with the United States Geological Survey who would like to see more pipes installed in Nyos soon.
In addition to the pent-up carbon dioxide, Nyos contains another hazard that has not been tackled: a weak dam at its northern edge. If the dam ruptured, it could cause a gas eruption and a flood that could flow as far as Nigeria, drowning or displacing up to 10,000 people.
"I am now a bit more concerned about that erosion than about the gas," said Umaru Sule, who survived the Nyos disaster but lost most of his family, and who now lives in Oklahoma, where he just completed his master's in agricultural education. "They should try to maybe see how they could reinforce the dam."
Mr. Sule's concerns may be addressed this spring. Dr. Halbwachs of the University of Savoy said a team of five scientists from a French group called Hydrologists Without Borders was planning to visit Lake Nyos in April to see if the members could do just that.
"So far, so good," said Dr. Tanyileke of the Cameroonian geological institute. "It looks as if some of our dreams are finally coming true."

HEADLINE: Turkey's Precarious Success 

BYLINE:  By Robert D. Kaplan; Robert D. Kaplan, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, is author of "Eastward to Tartary: Travels in the Balkans, the Middle East and the Caucasus."

DATELINE: STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Late last week in Turkey, the stock market declined by 18 percent and the lira lost a third of its value. Interest rates have soared to several thousand percent, and inflation is around 30 percent. What reportedly scared away investors was a publicized argument between President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, whom the president had accused of being too lenient toward corrupt politicians. But that was merely the beginning of the crisis, not its underlying cause.
 The cause was the very fragility of Turkey's recent economic reforms and the boomlet they had created, sending market indexes up from 5,000 to nearly 20,000 points in 1999 and early 2000. Turkey is building modern democratic and financial institutions that provide stability, but building such institutions can be destabilizing in its own right. Turkey's problems are those of success, but that does not make its problems any less dangerous to American interests. 
 Turkey, along with Brazil, perhaps, is now the world's foremost example of a state whose institutions are struggling to keep up with modernization. The government bureaucracy remains mired in Ottoman lethargy. Some banks, burdened by foreign-currency debts and murky dealings, are close to collapse. Tax revenues are insufficiently distributed to the provinces where they are needed.
Meanwhile, the dramatic liberalization of the Turkish economy begun in 1983 by Turgut Ozal, the late prime minister, has created a vast new population of urban middle-class Turks, who are pressing for better public services.
Stability has so far been maintained by the National Security Council, a mixed regime of military officers and civilian ministers. For decades, this council has prevented Turkey from slipping into the anarchy of new democracies like Indonesia or the stifling autocracy of many nearby Arab states. Nevertheless, that stability has come at an increasing cost, especially as Turkey's society and class structure have become more complex.
The problem is this, simply put: No one in the system is accountable. Turkey's needs for responsive, transparent banking and taxation systems have grown. But who would establish them?
The military has no logical role, and anyway, avoids political responsibility for many problems.
But the politicians also avoid responsibility. They know that in a crisis the military will bail them out through subtle interventions that Turks have come to call "soft, post-modern coups." Such ultimate reliance on the military is what keeps Turkish politics immature, as evinced by the kind of temper tantrums thrown by the president and prime minister last week. 
Another reason that both violence and political breakdown have been avoided in Turkey is the very corruption that is partly responsible for the current crisis in the first place. As Samuel P. Huntington explains in his 1968 classic, "Political Order in Changing Societies," high levels of corruption are endemic to societies undergoing the stress of rapid modernization. Corruption greases the wheels of creaky, unresponsive bureaucracies, creates informal networks of power so that things get done when they otherwise wouldn't, and allows people to purchase power in third world systems that they would otherwise violently revolt against.
Turkey, however, is at the point where such corruption has outlived its usefulness and threatens an Asian-style financial meltdown. Any meltdown in Turkey, however, would be far more serious than an economic meltdown in, say, Indonesia. That's because a Turkish economic disaster would have geopolitical consequences for the United States far more severe than the various economic crises that have affected East Asia in recent years.
Turkey is the political organizing principle of the greater Middle East. It controls the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers that supply Syria and Iraq, and it is the economic lifeline for new democracies in the Caucasus. Any weakening of Turkey's borders would open up the entire nest of questions -- dormant since the end of World War I -- regarding the real frontiers of Syria, Iraq and other countries, all of which were artificially created in postwar peace agreements.
Indeed, the Turkish military has been a fundamental element in the Middle East balance of power. For instance, a new Turkish-Israeli military alliance helped pressure Syria into peace negotiations with Israel in the late 1990's.
A strong, stable Turkish government would be even more needed if Saddam Hussein were to fall. Without Mr. Hussein, Iraq would have few ways to damp down divisive tribal and sectarian conflict, and the country could fall into civil strife. In that event, a stable Turkey would be necessary to safeguard Iraq's northern border with the Kurds. 
Turkey, in other words, is not a country like Thailand, where an economic crisis has only financial repercussions for the United States. Turkey is more in the category of an Israel or Mexico: a place whose strategic importance is too great to allow the White House to trust the International Monetary Fund and other international bodies with the cleanup operation.
The Reagan administration did not leave Israel, when it was ridden with inflation, to its own devices; the United States intervened to restructure the Israeli economy. The Clinton administration took aggressive action, at significant political cost, to bail out Mexico.
Both policies were successes. The Bush administration has stated its reluctance to prop up countries in economic turmoil. But in the case of Turkey, it may find it has no choice but to directly chaperone the Turkish political system toward further modernization, so that the current financial crisis does not expand into a geopolitical one. In short, the Bush administration should see the Turkish financial crisis less as a financial crisis than as a political and strategic one.

HEADLINE: Home Resales Slump in January 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Sales of previously owned homes fell sharply for a second consecutive month in January, the National Association of Realtors said today.
 Saying that the numbers are a sign that the Federal Reserve needs to cut interest rates further to keep the economy healthy, the association said existing-home sales plunged 6.6 percent in January, to an annual rate of 4.65 million units. 
That is the slowest sales rate since the 4.54 million in January 2000 and well below the 4.98 million level forecast by economists. 
 January's decline came after a similar 6.6 percent drop in December, when existing homes sold at a revised rate of 4.98 million units. The December figure was originally reported as 4.87 million.
David Lereah, chief economist at the association, said that he was concerned about the declines in existing-home sales, which make up about 80 percent of the overall housing market, and that aggressive interest rate reductions by the Fed earlier this year were not enough to halt the slide. In January, the Fed lowered its target for the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks a full percentage point.
"Further declines in mortgage rates are now necessary," Mr. Lereah said.
"The performance of the housing sector is critical to whether this economy, generally speaking, slips into a recession or not."
The association said the median home price fell to $136,600 in January -- the lowest since $136,100 last April -- from $139,700 in December.

HEADLINE: Happy Skies of Continental; 
Satisfaction Is Up. Morale Is Up. So Is Profit.

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
Kevin Nguyen, a Continental Airlines flight attendant, was worried that he had done something wrong when he was called into the cockpit on a flight from Newark to Las Vegas. After Mr. Nguyen squeezed through the narrow door, one of the pilots told him that Gordon M. Bethune, Continental's chairman, was on the line.
 "Then I really thought I was in trouble," Mr. Nguyen recalled. 
 But Mr. Bethune had good news. Mr. Nguyen had won a new Ford Explorer, one of eight that Continental raffles off twice a year to workers with perfect job attendance for the previous six months. 
"I couldn't believe it," said Mr. Nguyen, who emigrated from Vietnam in 1981 and has worked at Continental since 1997.
Neither could Wendy Pignataro, a Tampa reservations agent, who had been car pooling to work since 1993. Or Fred Miller, a 757 pilot. They and the five other winners received their prizes last month before hundreds of fellow employees at a raucous ceremony at the airline's headquarters here. "All I did was come to work like I'm supposed to, and they gave me a car," Mr. Miller said. "I am so impressed with that."
These are not happy times for most workers in the airline industry. All four of the country's largest carriers -- United Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines -- are facing possible strikes in the coming months by pilots, flight attendants or mechanics. Many workers are so frustrated with management that they have deliberately upset their airline's operations, inconveniencing passengers, to express their irritation. 
By contrast, at Continental, the nation's fifth-largest airline, it is a season of celebration. And one big reason for the turnaround is that the company, once a prime symbol of labor strife, can now lay claim to having the industry's highest morale.
A week before the Explorer giveaway, Continental declared Jan. 22 to be Independence Day. Each of its 54,000 employees received $100 to celebrate the airline's purchase of a controlling stake that had been held by Northwest. On Feb. 14, Mr. Bethune and Greg Brenneman, Continental's president, were handing out checks again, this time a share of Continental's profits equal to about 4 percent of every worker's salary.
Then there are the countless company picnics, ice cream parties, barbecues, and turkey and fried chicken dinners that dot the calendar throughout the year.
The benefits, which add little to the airline's costs, translate directly to the bottom line. Last year, Continental turned a profit for the sixth consecutive year. At the same time, Continental ranked first last year in the Transportation Department's on-time rankings and it consistently scores high in customer satisfaction surveys.
"It is not an accident that the best places to work are also the places that make the most money," Mr. Bethune said.
But only a few years ago, managers at United and Northwest were singing much the same song about their relations with employees. Today, they are widely considered to be the two carriers with the biggest labor headaches.
Executives at rival airlines say Continental's management -- for all its Mr. Nice Guy approach today -- has actually been coasting on the legacy of Frank Lorenzo, the former chief executive who abrogated Continental's union contracts in the early 1980's. Mr. Lorenzo got rid of most of the airline's unionized workers before hiring some back at greatly reduced salaries and benefits. As a result, Continental today enjoys much more flexible work rules and lower wage rates than its rivals.
"That honeymoon in the next two or three years is going to be over," said an executive at a competing carrier, noting that Continental may be experiencing a lull now because its labor contracts come up for renewal after everyone else's.
The airline industry's long boom may also be coming to an end as the economy weakens. Continental's profits, while still better than the industry average, declined last year after five consecutive years of increases.
Continental's pilots are already complaining that their wages and pension benefits have fallen far behind their peers at other airlines and they are looking for big gains when they begin contract negotiations next year. 
"Gordon has done a great job," said Pat Burke, president of the pilots union. "But before he got here, for 17 years since 1983, the pilots have been carrying this company. 
"There might be turmoil if they don't come up to bat," he added. "But I hope that won't happen."
The Lorenzo years have certainly been a boon to Continental's current managers, if only as a point of comparison. Because seniority is so important for many airline workers, few change companies. Many of Continental's current workers remember the lean years of the 1980's and early 1990's, when the airline filed for bankruptcy twice and appeared to be headed for oblivion.
"I started the week we went into bankruptcy 10 years ago," said Gayle Schulze, a crew pay analyst who came to watch the Explorer winners receive their keys from Mr. Bethune and Mr. Brenneman. "It is now 300 times better. What helps a lot is Gordon and Greg. Their personalities enthuse everybody. They're funny. I love listening to them speak."
Happier, more motivated workers, have produced more contented passengers in an industry not known for pleasing its customers. Continental ranked first in the latest customer satisfaction survey conducted by J. D. Power & Associates for both short- and long-haul flights. 
Michael Taylor, director of travel services at J. D. Power, said Continental had won the top rating among more than 6,000 frequent fliers surveyed -- even with one of its three hubs, at Newark, being among the most delay-prone airports in the country. "That is strictly due to the hustle of their people," Mr. Taylor said.
And Continental has won these plaudits despite not adding more legroom in coach, as American and United have done recently. Mr. Bethune, with characteristic bite, said Continental already offered a section with more legroom: "It's called first class."
A former Navy airplane mechanic who can press the flesh as well as any politician, Mr. Bethune delights in being the airline's chief cheerleader. He grew up in San Antonio and landed at Continental in 1994 after working as an executive at Piedmont Airlines and Boeing.
Continental had recently emerged from bankruptcy and was in danger of going broke yet again. After a rocky start, Mr. Bethune, now 59, and Mr. Brenneman, 39, a former management consultant, put together a successful strategy to expand Continental's presence at Newark and Houston and turn around morale. Today, the two men, along with Larry Kellner, 42, Continental's chief financial officer, are considered by Wall Street to be one of the top executive teams in the airline industry. They are also among the highest paid.
Not long after arriving, Mr. Bethune said he realized Continental's workers wanted to succeed but were beaten down by years of cost-cutting and management by fear. To this weary group, he announced that he was going to make Continental an enjoyable place to work.
"It didn't take much," said Mr. Burke, the pilot leader, who was in the habit of changing out of his uniform before leaving the airport in the early 1990's because he was ashamed of working for Continental. "Just a little dignity and respect and some pats on the back."
Cash and prizes did not hurt, either.
Every employee now receives at least $65 for each month that Continental ranks among the top three on-time airlines by the Transportation Department, or completes at least 80 percent of its flights on schedule. (The prize rises to $100 for every month that Continental ranks first.) Over the last six years, the bonuses have totaled $157 million, half of what the airline said delayed flights would cost in terms of hotels and other passenger compensation.
By the same token, the 83 Ford sport utility vehicles Continental has given away since 1996 have saved about $20 million by reducing the airline's rate of absenteeism, Jo Richard, Continental's director of human resources, said.
Mr. Kellner, the chief financial officer, said: "Three to four celebrations a year cost us $20 an employee. Compare that to our payroll, and you can't find it. But those are the things people remember."
Indeed, the Explorer giveaway has been a huge hit with employees. More than 14,000, or about one-third of Continental's employees, qualified in the most recent six-month period.
At Mr. Bethune's instance, the Explorers are the special Eddie Bauer edition with leather interiors and lots of extras. He did not want any worker to doubt that Continental would offer them the top of the line.
He also insisted that the airline pay all the taxes and license fees so that the winners, many of whom make modest salaries, could afford to keep the car. When United offered workers the choice of a Jeep Cherokee or $25,000 in cash in a similar contest a few years ago, not a single worker took the car.
"I want all their friends to see it," Mr. Bethune said of the Explorers, each of which bears a special Continental identification plate. "And when they ask, 'How can I win a car like that?' the answer is, all you have to do is show up for work."
Workers with perfect attendance who are not lucky enough to win an Explorer receive a $50 gift certificate. The amount of the gift increases with each consecutive six-month period that workers go without missing a day of work, peaking at $300 after three years.
When not handing out cash and S.U.V.'s, Mr. Bethune works hard at communicating with employees. He and Mr. Brenneman hold monthly open houses where workers can come and ask questions. They hand out chicken dinners, help load bags on the busiest holidays and generally make the rounds. Every Friday, Mr. Bethune records a voice mail message to employees.
As a result, Mr. Bethune is one of the most visible airline chief executives in the industry. Walking through Bush International Airport in Houston recently, he stopped frequently for dozens of employees who wanted to shake his hand or who called out greetings. A ramp supervisor asked if Mr. Bethune would break away from an interview for a few minutes to meet his crew. He happily obliged.
A master of the down-home aphorism, Mr. Bethune likes to boil things down to simple metaphors, often sprinkling his comments with obscenities. "If your watch stopped every other day, would you wear it?" he asked a new class of flight attendants, many of whom eagerly snapped his picture when he got up to speak. "You would throw it away. It's of no value to you. We cannot be good one day and lousy the next."
Mr. Bethune is confident that Continental's employee relations will not sour the way they have at the other major airlines. He has said repeatedly that he is willing to negotiate a new contract giving his mechanics and pilots what their peers are getting at competing carriers. That is all the unions say they want; the test is still to come. But Mr. Bethune clearly understands what is at stake.
"It's easier to run a good airline than a lousy one," he said. "Why wouldn't we want to keep it up?"

HEADLINE: Cash Crunch Imperils High School Football 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: MOBILE, Ala., Feb. 22 

 BODY:
Harold W. Dodge, the superintendent of the Mobile County school system, is a brave man. At least, that is one way to look at it.
 Facing state-imposed budget cuts because of plummeting tax collections, Dr. Dodge proposed a series of measures last week to bring his $430 million budget into balance. Some were predictable, like not filling vacancies, canceling textbook orders and selling surplus property. Others were not, like delaying the opening of school until Oct. 1, the start of the county's fiscal year, in order to ease the system's cash-flow problems. 
 But one proposal has set this community on fire, making some residents question whether Dr. Dodge has any idea where he lives. To save $1.3 million in supplemental salaries paid each year to coaches and band directors, Dr. Dodge has proposed eliminating all extracurricular activities, including football and other sports. 
That would be a radical notion in any state. In Alabama, it is closer to sacrilege.
Friday nights without high school football in sports-crazed Mobile "would be like having Catholicism without the pope," said Bonnie Hebert, a math teacher at Ben C. Rain High School.
Paul H. Christopher, the manager of Ladd-Peebles Stadium, the city-owned field where Friday night games can attract close to 20,000 fans, said the entire community was up in arms. "Football in this part of the country is more than a sport," Mr. Christopher explained, noting that a dozen active professional players came from the area. "It's first cousin to a religion."
Dr. Dodge's proposal to cut football and other programs starkly illustrates the consequences of the declining revenues that have started to plague state and local governments as the economy softens, particularly in the South and Midwest. Revenues from the sales tax and income tax that support Alabama's education trust fund fell $266 million behind projections in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, and dropped another $72 million in the first quarter of the current year.
Though his cuts have not been enacted, Dr. Dodge insists that he is not bluffing. But he also hopes that the prospect of a fall without football will startle Mobile into raising school taxes -- an idea voters rejected two years ago by a 3-to-1 ratio. 
Clearly, he has succeeded in getting people's attention, although not all of it is welcome.
His nervous security detail has stepped up its patrols of his house. His wife has tired of donning her nicest gowns for the city's famous Mardi Gras balls, only to spend her evenings listening to other partygoers berate her husband. After giving up cigarettes for five weeks, Dr. Dodge has started smoking again. It was the stress, he said.
"I knew it might be superintendent suicide," he acknowledged in an interview. "My secretary's fielded more calls than you can imagine from people saying, 'You've lost your damn mind.' "
But feeling that he has few alternatives, Dr. Dodge has proceeded anyway. Indeed, even after a Circuit Court judge in Montgomery ruled that Gov. Don Siegelman's education cuts were unconstitutional, the Mobile superintendent has continued to press his plan. The court ruling, he reasoned, was simply the first shot in what will surely become a drawn-out legal and political battle.
A state law required Governor Siegelman, a Democrat from Mobile, to impose a 6.2 percent midyear cut in education spending to match the drop in the trust fund. Under that law, the state has little discretion in how to make the cuts, and Mr. Siegelman has called a special legislative session to seek more flexibility.
But the state financial crisis is only part of the problem in Mobile. With 66,000 students, Mobile has the largest school system in the state. In 1999, the county spent $640 per student in local money, almost a third less than the state average, according to state figures.
Simply raising the local contribution to the state average would more than close this year's shortfall of $15 million. But residents of this Gulf Coast city have long resisted the local tax increases needed to finance their schools adequately. Voters have rejected tax increases for the schools three times since 1988. 
Many here hold the school system accountable for a two-decade-old corruption scandal that led to the conviction of several county and school system leaders for malfeasance. 
And though some here disagree, Dr. Dodge says he believes that many white property owners are reluctant to raise taxes to support a public school system that is about half black.
Without a tax increase, Dr. Dodge maintains, his options are limited. Nearly 90 percent of his budget goes to salaries and benefits and cannot be touched because of contracts. In his three years as superintendent, he has cut his budget by nearly $11 million. The school system finished the last fiscal year with only $161,000 in the bank, not enough to support even a single day's operations. 
The county commission has proposed a referendum for May 1 to consider a 69 percent increase in the property tax rate for schools, a larger increase than the one rejected two years ago. The referendum is first subject to the approval of the State Legislature, where passage is far from guaranteed. 
At least, Dr. Dodge said, his proposals seem to have focused the county's attention on the realities of the school system's financial needs. Students and teachers have helped make the case. To illustrate the impact of Dr. Dodge's proposed cuts, the county's music directors pulled their marching bands out of Mardi Gras parades.
"What's incredible to me is that you have to disassemble something to get people to believe you," Dr. Dodge said. "People thought I was the Antichrist when I proposed to cut athletics. But when I said the F-word -- in Alabama that's football -- it was like I had finally hit the mule on the right end."
That provides little solace at the moment to Jamarcus T. Russell, a 15-year-old sophomore quarterback for Williamson High School who is considered one of the most promising athletes ever to play here. In his first two years, Mr. Russell passed for 5,299 yards and 40 touchdowns, leading his Lions once to the state championship game and once to the semifinals.
He has received letters from dozens of major collegiate programs, including Florida State, Tennessee and Notre Dame. But he assumes their interest will wane if he cannot play his final two years. 
Without a football scholarship, Mr. Russell might manage to attend a local college. But even by taking on extra work, his mother, Zina L. Russell-Anderson, a machine operator in a furniture factory, said she would not be able to send her son out of state. 
"They're stealing something that I want to become," Mr. Russell said.
Johnny L. Keith, the quarterback at Murphy High School, said his father would send him to college if he did not receive a scholarship. "But it's just that dream," Mr. Keith said, "of getting that scholarship and taking that burden off of your parents."
Last year, Mobile County students won college athletic scholarships worth $2.4 million. 
But there are other consequences. Teachers and parents here say that football and other sports give students an incentive to make the grades needed to play in college, and that they keep youths off the streets in the afternoon. "The crime rate is going to go sky high," said Kathy C. Dyess, a technology aide at Ben C. Rain High School.
Some parents are considering sending their children to private school. Others have talked about moving to neighboring Baldwin County, where the fiscal problems are less severe.
Ms. Dyess, though committed to her county and to the public schools, is one of them. "I'm thinking about leaving, really," she said. "I've only got a third grader, but he's very sports-oriented and I've got to plan for the future."

HEADLINE: Israel's Unity Government 

 BODY:
Israel's Labor Party acted responsibly yesterday by voting to join a national unity government under the Likud Party leader, Ariel Sharon. Crucial details are yet to be worked out, including Labor's new leadership and the identity of its cabinet nominees. But the important portfolios Labor will hold, including the Defense and Foreign Ministries, should permit it to exert a moderating influence on the new government's policies. 
 This will be particularly important on issues like military tactics against Palestinian unrest and future relations with Yasir Arafat and other Arab leaders. Already Labor has secured a commitment to the principle of trading land for peace and an affirmation of existing agreements like the 1993 Oslo accords with the Palestinians. 
 Labor's decision frees Mr. Sharon from dependence on the narrow coalition of right-wing and religious parties that he would otherwise have needed for a parliamentary majority. Neither he nor Israeli voters wanted to see the new government beholden from the start to these fractious and ideological groups. By joining with Labor, Mr. Sharon commits himself to a broadly centrist course. But for a national unity government to be effective, it must be more than a facade. Labor ministers must be consulted on important policies and given authority to run their departments. 
The new Israeli government will inherit a difficult situation when it takes office next month. Peace talks with the Palestinians have collapsed. Violent unrest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is about to enter its sixth month. Anti-Israeli rhetoric from Syria, Iraq and Iran is becoming increasingly belligerent. Mr. Sharon and his ministers must protect Israel's security while looking for ways to renew the search for peace to which both Labor and Likud have made major contributions over the years. 
To this end, Israel should give serious consideration to Secretary of State Colin Powell's suggestion over the weekend that it look for ways to ease economic pressures on the Palestinians. In a welcome early response to this American suggestion, Israel agreed to dismantle the military checkpoints that had briefly cut Gaza in two. Further Israeli steps, like a release of tax revenues to the Palestinian Authority, would be more likely if Mr. Arafat began living up to his commitments to discourage further violence.
Some Labor leaders argued for remaining outside the Sharon government, so that the party could rebuild its public support and re-energize its strategy for peace negotiations. But they were decisively outvoted by those who felt that forcing Mr. Sharon to form a narrow right-wing coalition would be dangerous for Israel at a particularly difficult moment in its history. That wiser view has now prevailed.

HEADLINE: Chiang Mai Journal; 
A Courageous Editor's Lonely Quest

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: CHIANG MAI, Thailand 

 BODY:
It's not much of a newspaper office three little computers and an ailing 30-year-old printing press squeezed into a converted beauty salon. But it's a pretty good bunker.
 In a tiny inner office, a black .38-caliber pistol lies on the editor's desk near a handful of hollow-tip bullets. A bulletproof vest is slung over the back of a chair. The small, thick-walled press room is just a step away. 
 "If they come after me again," said the editor, Amnat Jongyotying, 46, "there's not much chance they'll walk out of here. I don't care how many times I'm hit; if I can take just one of them with me I'll be satisfied. They know I'm ready for them. I'm a dangerous person now." 
Despite his bravado, Mr. Amnat admits that he is terrified. Last spring, four gunmen almost killed him with a bullet through his abdomen after he refused to stop his relentless newspaper attacks on the local political kingpin.
Now, despite bribery attempts and threats to him and his family, he is going after his attackers in court as well as in print. What was once a journalistic mission of investigative reporting has become a personal vendetta. Mr. Amnat is convinced that he is in a fight to the death.
"I don't have any choice," he said. "If I win I die, and if I lose I die. In Thailand we have a saying: 'If you break the back of a snake, make sure you kill it or it will come back and bite you.' I'm like the snake. Their big mistake was that they didn't kill me."
Thailand has some of the freest news media in Asia. But as in many developing countries, the life of a provincial journalist can be dangerous, far from the sight of the outside world and a long way from the reach of the law. There are two choices: bow to the power of the local politician or go to war.
"My sense of it is that most provincial reporters stay away from that kind of warlord story because they know what is at stake and what they risk," said A. Lin Neumann, the Asia consultant for the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.
"Amnat, for whatever reason, is one of those unusual fellows who is absolutely bound and determined to do the kind of journalism he thinks is right," Mr. Neumann said. "He's not a nut. He is just particularly driven to make that little newspaper of his into something that can change Chiang Mai. And as a result he almost died, and he still could die."
Mr. Amnat said he had told his children, "If I can make Chiang Mai a better place, even a little bit, that is something you should be proud of."
Mr. Amnat's wife, Phongpan, who sold her land, gave up her beauty business and took journalism courses to help him open the paper 11 years ago, is risking her life as well.
"After he was shot, I tried to make him stop," said Mrs. Phongpan, who runs the business side of the newspaper. "When he got out of the hospital, he was afraid. He wouldn't hold me at night. He would only hold his gun and his bulletproof vest."
All but a handful of his staff members quit. The local kingpin spread the word and advertisers withdrew their business. His teenage son and daughter were receiving threatening calls on the office telephone.
"I tried not working and not bringing any money in, but he went ahead and did everything himself," Mrs. Phongpan said. "I stood there and watched him, in his shorts, doing the layout by himself, putting out all 12 pages without staff. That's when I realized I couldn't stop him. His life is the paper. And I said to myself, 'I give in.' "
She smiled at her husband. "Sometimes I joke with him," she said. "He sits in the back office and I'm out front. I'll probably be the one to take the bullet."
But no matter how hard they both work, the little newspaper, called The Northern Daily, may not survive. The paper is deeply in debt and losing money with every issue. It has shrunk from 16 pages, eliminated color and reduced its frequency from every day to once every three days.
Squeezed by Thailand's economic recession three years ago, the paper's circulation in this northern city of 300,000 people dropped from a high of 10,000 to just 1,000. With the attack on Mr. Amnat, demand suddenly rose. "When I was shot, I was hurt, yes," he said. "But it was great for circulation."
But still his print run is limited to 2,000 copies; he cannot afford the cost of paper to print more.
Some of the staff members who have stayed with him now carry guns too, he said, adding, "My reporters are also my bodyguards." Everybody does a bit of everything, gathering in the press room on print days to fold the newspaper by hand.
As he struggles to keep his newspaper alive, Mr. Amnat continues to publish the critical articles other papers leave alone, including the twists and turns of his own case.
"I want people to know what is going on in Chiang Mai," he said. "We have to keep an eye on our politicians, see what they are up to, see how they cheat. During the last election I ran a headline: 'It's Cheaper to Buy a Vote Than to Buy a Dog.' People liked that article."
Chiang Mai is ruled by the kind of old-style clique -- Mr. Amnat calls it a mafia -- that still holds influence throughout much of Thailand. From the start, Mr. Amnat said, he was determined to do the kind of probing journalism that is generally found only in big, powerful national papers.
Although his newspaper may be popular enough, few people want to have anything to do with him. Insurance companies have declined to cover him. People are afraid to sit near him in restaurants. Even his sister and brother refuse to travel in the same car with him. 
"They say, 'If you're going to die, don't take us with you,' " he said.
He is conspicuous around town, looking a bit like a penguin with his oversize shirts buttoned over his bulletproof vest. His fellow journalists have turned their backs, he said, asking him, "Why do you have to make such a big deal out of this?"
In an effort to put pressure on a reluctant prosecutor to proceed, he took 20 local reporters with him last year to demand that charges of attempted murder be brought against the four gunmen. But, bribed or threatened, none of the local newspapers -- apart from The Northern Daily -- reported on his demand.
The assassination attempt itself was a big one-day story in the national press and was condemned by the Thai Journalists Association. But it passed almost unnoticed here in Chiang Mai.
As someone who was a police reporter 28 years ago, Mr. Amnat has high-ranking friends on the force, and some of them are providing protection for him. On the day of the shooting, the police arrested the four gunmen as they waited by their pickup truck, confident of their impunity, at a local carwash.
But that is about as far as things have gone.
Mr. Amnat gathered 30 witnesses who had seen the shooting or could recount the movements of the gunmen. But only two -- one of them his 18-year-old daughter -- are now willing to testify. And like his fellow reporters, his former advertisers, his family members and his witnesses, Mr. Amnat said, local lawyers have shied away from him.
"At the first hearing, the court assigned a lawyer to the case," Mr. Amnat said, "but when he found out who is behind it, he said, 'Well, I'll just stay behind the scenes.' "
Mr. Amnat is still pushing the case in the courts, but he guesses that it may take three years or more to reach any kind of resolution. Even then, it is unlikely that the man he holds responsible will ever be charged.
"It is the rule of gunmen never to disclose the person who hired them," said Thongbai Thongpao, a human rights lawyer in Bangkok who is familiar with the case. "They are also afraid. The hand of the law can never touch the mastermind who is behind hired gunmen."
Mr. Amnat knows that, but it no longer seems to matter.
"Maybe I'm a little crazy," he said. "I've never been afraid of powerful people. Some of my friends say: 'Don't you love your wife and kids? If you love them you should stop all this.' I do love them, but I can't stop."
Mr. Amnat has never confronted the man he believes wanted him killed, but he cherishes a little fantasy about meeting him.
"When I see him in a public place," he said, "I just want to go step on his toe and ask him, 'Why did you have me shot?' But if I did that, I'd probably be dead."

HEADLINE: U.S. Finds Rights Abuses in China, Colombia and Israel 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
The State Department concluded today that despite seven years of deepening American economic engagement with China, the human rights situation there had worsened significantly, with "intensified crackdowns" on religious organizations, political dissenters and "any person or group perceived to threaten the government."
 The department's annual review of human rights in 195 countries and territories, the Bush administration's first, also offered a harsh assessment of how Israel dealt with Palestinian uprisings last year. It described Indonesia as a nation increasingly out of control, where random killings and lawlessness are becoming the norms. 
 And the report concluded that Colombia, whose president, Andres Pastrana, is to meet Mr. Bush in the White House on Tuesday, is far from bringing paramilitary groups under control. 
In what could prove a particularly sensitive section, the report concludes that in Colombia, where the United States is providing a $1.3 billion, two-year aid package, mostly military, "paramilitary forces find a ready support base within the military and police, as well as among local civilian elites in many areas." 
While the report praises President Pastrana, it denounces massacres and abuses by private and government security forces in the struggle against leftist rebels.
The department's report was assembled and drafted largely during the Clinton administration. But Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, had time to review the findings and in a few sensitive chapters, particularly on Israel, to alter some wording, Bush administration officials said.
Today the administration, as expected, announced that the United States would pursue a resolution condemning China's record at the United Nations Human Rights Commission, which is to meet in Geneva next month. The Clinton administration never succeeded in getting enough countries to join in the annual resolution to win passage, and it is unclear how much political capital the Bush administration is willing to expend to win support for a resolution that is almost certain to be defeated once again.
But the report poses a deeper problem for Mr. Bush: He must now choose the best path for influencing the rights records of other nations, a issue that vexed his predecessor for eight years.
Mr. Clinton insisted that over time, economic engagement with China would force the government to loosen its control over the political process. There is little evidence yet that the strategy is working, though the acting assistant secretary for human rights, Michael Parmly, noted today that "the Internet has resulted in some improvements" in China, "largely in spite of government actions to control it."
But he noted that in dealings in Tibet and in the crackdown on the Falun Gong and other religious groups, "the situation has worsened in significant areas."
At the same time, the report is also harshly critical of conditions in three countries where the United States has maintained nearly a full economic embargo: Cuba, Myanmar and North Korea. In each, the report found conditions were no better, and in some cases were worse.
Critics of both approaches -- engagement and isolation -- will find ammunition in the voluminous report (so voluminous that the State Department now publishes it only on a CD-ROM and on its Web site, www .state.gov).
"Their dilemma is the same as the one Clinton faced," said Mike Jendrzejczyk, who follows Asia for Human Rights Watch. "It hasn't changed one iota. The issue hasn't been whether to engage, but how."
An early test of whether the administration plans to turn the findings into new policy may come as General Powell pursues the resolution against China. 
He and Mr. Bush could press Mexico, or European allies, to support the resolution, or they could save their political influence for another issue. Diplomats at the State Department said it is too early to know how far General Powell is willing to go. 
Clinton administration officials who worked on the early drafts of the report said today that after their brief review of it on the Internet, it appears largely unchanged. 
"The key was Israel," one said, "and there they left the main conclusion, which is that there was excessive force on the Israeli side, and human rights violations on the Palestinian side as well."
On Colombia, the report concluded that while "the government's human rights record remained poor," still "there were some improvements in the legal framework and in institutional mechanisms." 
The report for the first time explicitly discussed links between the United States-backed Colombian security forces and paramilitary groups, whose attacks are increasing, saying such collusion ranged from allowing the militia members to pass through roadblocks to sharing intelligence and ammunition.
President Pastrana, who was in Washington today, said his government was developing a strategy to crack down on such groups, including efforts to disrupt their financing. He said conditions "are improving, though there is still much work to be done in this area."
Despite a similarly grim portrait of conditions in Colombia last year, President Clinton waived a series of human rights benchmarks mandated by Congress in order for the military aid to flow. 
Bush officials say their Colombia policy is still under review.

HEADLINE: The Citibank Connection: Real Money, Shadow Banks 

BYLINE:  By TIM GOLDEN 

 BODY:
At the climax of one of the biggest undercover money-laundering investigation in United States history, federal agents seized $1.8 million in 1998 from Citibank accounts in New York that were held by a mysterious Cayman Islands bank that had no corporate offices anywhere in the world.
 But despite indications that the money had come from drug dealers in Mexico, Citibank continued to do business with the Caymans bank for almost two years, moving another $300 million through the accounts before they were finally closed by Citibank. 
 Officials of Citibank and its parent company, Citigroup Inc., said they had not realized that anything might be amiss with the Caymans bank, which was tied to a financial group in Argentina led by the former treasury secretary there. And they emphasized that they have since developed a system for processing official seizures to avoid such mistakes. 
Yet interviews with government investigators and a new study of the case by the Democratic staff of a Senate subcommittee raise questions about Citibank's slow response to the indications that something was wrong with the operations of the Caymans bank, M. A. Bank Ltd.
"They weren't just asleep at the switch -- they were in a deep sleep on this one," Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who oversaw the Senate inquiry, said of Citibank. "Even after the seizure warrant, they continued to accept deposits from M. A. Bank without due diligence."
Both the government investigators and money-laundering experts said the case was striking evidence of how criminals have been able to move illicit funds surreptitiously through accounts that offshore banks keep at big institutions in the United States.
Those so-called correspondent accounts provide tiny foreign banks that are subject to little government regulation with access to the American financial system. As many as 2,000 such banks are scattered around the world, mostly in small island nations in the Caribbean, the South Pacific and elsewhere.
M. A. Bank, which was licensed in 1991, was a classic shell: It never had so much as an office in the Caymans, and its supposed administrative headquarters in Uruguay was nothing more than the address of an accounting firm that processed its correspondence, the Senate report said. At least part of the millions of dollars wired into its accounts in New York were then paid out in cash in Argentina to a local real estate agent later identified by American officials as a representative of the Mexican drug traffickers.
To bankers at Citigroup, however, M. A. Bank drew legitimacy from being part of the Mercado Abierto Group, a financial group based in Buenos Aires that had been a Citibank client since 1989. The group is owned by three well-known economic officials of the military governments that ruled that country until the early 1980's, the most prominent of whom, Aldo Luis Ducler, served as treasury secretary then and is now the group's president.
Federal and Senate investigators suggested that Citibank officials had considerable reason to grow suspicious of M. A. Bank after May 18, 1998, when they were ordered to seize the $1.8 million -- all that was left of $7.7 million that Mexican drug traffickers had funneled through the account. The warrant presented to Citibank cited federal money-laundering laws as grounds for the confiscation. 
The warrant was also delivered just as the Clinton administration was presenting what it called Operation Casablanca, in which Customs agents uncovered a network of Mexican and Venezuelan banks that were helping Mexico's biggest drug traffickers to hide their profits.
The affidavit filed in federal court in Los Angeles in support of the Citibank seizure clearly tied it to the undercover investigation.
Nonetheless, Citibank officials told Senate staff members that it was only when the investigators approached them with questions about their handling of the M. A. Bank account -- 17 months after the seizure -- that they finally linked the seizure to drug trafficking.
Several American officials asserted that the Customs agents who ran the Casablanca investigation could have been more aggressive in pursuing the Argentine connection.
The Argentine real estate agent to whom Citibank paid the money in Buenos Aires had been put in touch with undercover agents by the man then considered Mexico's biggest drug trafficker, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the American officials said.
And according to a forfeiture complaint filed by the federal government, the real estate agent and Mr. Ducler, of the Mercado Abierto Group, set up the accounts on behalf of a former Mexican federal police official convicted in the United States of drug smuggling.
In a telephone interview from Buenos Aires, Mr. Ducler denied ever having met the former police official, and said he never had any clue that the real estate agent, now a fugitive from Argentine justice, was representing Mexican traffickers. 
He emphasized that about one-third of the $1.8 million seized was later returned in a settlement, and that the illegal funds wired to M. A. Bank's account with Citibank had originated in an undercover Customs Service account at Bank of America. 
"No illicit money could ever have come into our bank had it not come in an undercover operation, and from an institution of the first rank, like the Bank of America," he said. "Not only did we not infect the financial system of the United States, but it was the United States' undercover operation that infected us with illicit funds."

HEADLINE: Daimler Anticipates A Hard Year, LosingPerhaps $1.5 Billion 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: STUTTGART, Germany, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
With his career and the fate of the world's biggest auto merger hanging in the balance, the chairman and chief executive of DaimlerChrysler A.G. announced his plans for a turnaround today but forecast a grim year ahead.
 The executive, Jurgen E. Schrempp, warned that Chrysler's American car and truck business would lose $2 billion to $2.5 billion this year and would not break even until some time in 2002. 
 Today's announcement came about four months after Chrysler, in sharp contrast to Mr. Schrempp's ebullient forecasts, startled investors with its huge losses. The presentation today also reinforced that DaimlerChrysler is now a fully German-run company. 
As a light snow fell outside the packed conference hall here, Mr. Schrempp seemed determined to get all the bad news out. To pay for the costs of reducing the Chrysler unit's work force by 26,000, DaimlerChrysler will take a charge against earnings of nearly $3 billion and will report a first-quarter operating loss of about $4 billion. For the full year, executives estimated that the parent company could lose $1.5 billion or so.
But aside from saying that "a few things have not worked out," Mr. Schrempp brushed aside suggestions that his strategy of forming a global company was flawed.
And the tone today was markedly different from that in past presentations. When Mr. Schrempp proudly announced the merger between the former Daimler-Benz and Chrysler nearly three years ago, he declared that the company's official language would be English and he relished switching between English and German as he answered questions.
Today, he and all other executives on the podium spoke only German. There were no American executives on hand. A newly created automotive management committee will be headed by Mr. Schrempp and five other longtime Daimler executives from Stuttgart.
Saying repeatedly that Chrysler's financial troubles stemmed in part from "internal factors," Mr. Schrempp said that "a new competent leadership has been put in place." Indeed, since late in October, he has ousted most of Chrysler's top American managers and installed a trusted lieutenant, Dieter Zetsche, as Chrysler's president and chief executive.
Mr. Schrempp and Mr. Zetsche had already announced the main components of their turnaround plan. They include the 26,000 job reductions over the next two years, demands for immediate price cuts from suppliers, pushing ahead with the introduction of new Chrysler vehicles including a successor to the Jeep and the sharing of more of the underlying auto components among Mercedes, Chrysler and Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, one-third owned by Daimler.
But Mr. Schrempp is fighting fires on several fronts. Industry executives, at Chrysler as well as its rivals, predict that vehicle sales in the United States will decline by slightly more than 10 percent this year, to about 16 million. Deep discounting and other financial incentives can easily cut into revenue.
DaimlerChrysler is also wrestling with problems at Mitsubishi, which announced its own turnaround program today.
And the American truck subsidiary, Freightliner, started losing money in the second half of 2000 amid a downturn in the American truck market similar to Chrysler's problems in auto sales.
Mr. Schrempp seems to be running short on time. DaimlerChrysler's share price has declined by more than half from its peak in January 1999. In New York today, the company's American-listed shares closed down 68 cents at $48.12.
Deutsche Bank, DaimlerChrysler's biggest shareholder, with a 12 percent stake, again said today that it stood behind Mr. Schrempp. But even that statement had a backhanded chilliness, emphasizing the bank's confidence that Mr. Schrempp would begin to produce a turnaround "in the next 12 months."
Earlier this month, DaimlerChrysler hired Deutsche Bank and J. P. Morgan Chase to advise it on potential defense strategies if it became the target of a hostile takeover attempt.
For the moment, there are few signs that any rival is interested in a hostile takeover. But the old security that once characterized Germany's network of cross-shareholdings has largely evaporated, and even Deutsche Bank has said it wants to reduce its industrial company holdings.
Daimler executives took pains today to set cautious expectations. "The year 2000 was very difficult," said Manfred Gentz, the chief financial officer. "We have an even more difficult year ahead of us."
The company predicted that operating profit would decline to a level between 1.2 billion and 1.7 billion euros from about 5.2 billion euros in 2000, or $4.74 billion at current exchange rates. And that estimate does not include a Chrysler restructuring charge of $3 billion. Mr. Gentz, when pressed, said the final operating loss -- including the restructuring charge and possible one-time gains -- could be about 1.7 billion euros, or $1.55 billion.
A big question is whether DaimlerChrysler can make good on the unfulfilled promise of sharing components between Mercedes and Chrysler. So far, executives at Mercedes have been reluctant or downright hostile to sharing important components with Chrysler, fearing that the Mercedes brand might be cheapened.
Today, Mr. Zetsche and others listed a number of areas for greater sharing: electronic controls from seat warmers to monitoring systems, rear axles, transmissions and steering systems. 
Daimler has also said that it will put Mercedes diesel engines into a few Chrysler vehicles, like the PT Cruiser, but only in those sold in Europe.
There will be much more sharing between Chrysler and Mitsubishi. Chrysler already uses a Mitsubishi platform -- the unseen components beneath the body of the car -- for its Sebring and Dodge Stratus sedans. The plan now is to team up in building a new version of the compact Neon. Mitsubishi and Mercedes, separate from Chrysler, plan to cooperate on a new version of Mercedes' quirky subcompact, the Smart car.
But Mercedes' chief executive, Jurgen Hubbert, made clear that he had no intention of going beyond the sharing of components that are largely invisible to the typical car buyer. Mr. Hubbert said the company saw no need yet to supply Mercedes engines for use in American Chrysler cars. As for Mercedes platforms in Chrysler's American cars, he dismissed the idea as "kein thema" -- not a topic of discussion.

HEADLINE: Bitter Strike At Domino Finally Ends 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Strikers at the mammoth Domino Sugar refinery in Brooklyn agreed yesterday to return to work, ending the city's longest labor battle in what even union leaders acknowledged was a stinging loss.
 The 20-month strike had become a major test for the local labor movement, with 284 workers holding out on the picket line for nine months at one of Brooklyn's few remaining large manufacturing operations. 
 But the strikers gradually started crossing the picket line, feeling abandoned by their parent union and the labor movement at large.
"It's a complete loss," acknowledged Joe Crimi, the chief negotiator for the strikers, who work at the 143-year-old refinery, a symbol of New York's onetime manufacturing might. 
Under the new contract, approved on Friday in a ratification vote by members of Local 1814 of the International Longshoremen's Association, Domino will be allowed to cut 110 jobs at the refinery. The three-year contract, union officials said, also provides for a one-time 5 percent raise on top of the workers' average weekly base pay of about $600.
For the first nine months of the strike, the 284 unionized workers showed extraordinary solidarity, without anyone crossing the picket line. But then they cracked, with workers crossing the picket line in fives and tens because their unemployment insurance had expired and because, they said, they were convinced that the walkout was making little headway. 
By last weekend, 104 former strikers had crossed the picket line, and the company insisted that production had long been back to normal. The workers who remained on strike felt so little hope that they voted 56 to 48 to approve the contract, which was little different from a management proposal that they unanimously rejected four months ago.
The strikers blamed their parent union for doing little for them -- it did not even provide strike benefits. They blamed the labor movement for turning its back on them by not rallying to their cause. They blamed their co-workers for crossing the picket line. And they accused the president of their union local of selling them out to put this embarrassing fight behind them.
"We got shafted," said Charles Milan, who has worked for 37 years in the refinery's packaging department. "We got stabbed in the back."
Domino Sugar, a division of Tate & Lyle, a British company that is one of the world's largest sweetener producers, praised the workers' decision to approve the contract.
In a news release, the company said the new agreement "provides substantial improvement in wages and benefits for union employees, and it also contains the operating flexibility which the company sought to improve competitiveness in the volatile U.S. cane sugar market."
The company repeatedly told the workers that it needed to reduce its work force because profits were down and because the company was starting to ship semiprocessed sugar to the Brooklyn refinery, rather than the traditional unrefined sugar.
"The resulting loss of some Brooklyn processing jobs has been eased by a generous enhanced severance package," the company said.
Jim McNamara, a spokesman for the International Longshoremen's Association, defended the role of the parent union, saying it gave the strikers generous support and even paid for union officials to travel to England to protest at a Tate & Lyle board meeting.
While company officials said it was time for union and management to work together, some workers acknowledged there would inevitably be tensions between those who crossed the picket line and those who remained on strike to the end. 
Charles Sekera, a machine operator, said he crossed the picket line last April, after being on strike for 10 months, because the strike was costing him a lot of money and because he was getting little information from his union.
"The union lost big-time," he said. "The union was out for more than a year and a half for nothing."
Denis Hughes, president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the strike seemed doomed from the start.
"It bothered me from the beginning that the union wasn't strong enough to put this together," he said. "It shows that even in the best of situations management has an enormous amount of power. One of the things we have to do better in the trade union movement is to develop strategies at the beginning of a dispute, instead of midway through."
Yesterday afternoon, the trailer that served as the center of the strike activities looked as if a hurricane had hit it. Empty Coke cans were everywhere, and the workers were tearing from the walls solidarity statements from other unions.
Hernando Gallego, a sugar boiler, conceded that he voted to approve management's proposal, saying, "I don't like the contract at all, but there's nothing to hold out for anymore."

HEADLINE: Elizabeth Police Say Man Shot by Officers Wanted to Be Killed 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: ELIZABETH, N.J., Feb. 26 

 BODY:
 A man who yelled that he was armed but was only holding a Bible -- was fatally shot here this weekend by a police officer, the authorities said. They said they believed he wanted the police to kill him. 
 The man, Mark Frederick Venuti, 36, was shot twice and was pronounced dead at 1:39 a.m. Sunday at University Hospital in Newark. 
The Elizabeth Police said they had received three calls about 10 p.m. on Saturday, one of them possibly made by Mr. Venuti, from a building at 819 Canton Street, where he lived in a basement apartment.
When two officers went to the address, Mr. Venuti yelled at them from behind his apartment door that he was armed, the police said. He then opened the door, and, holding a dark object above his head, charged one of the officers, who shot him once, they said. The wounded man then turned to the other officer, the police said, and demanded to be shot. When the officer refused, Mr. Venuti again charged the first officer, who shot him a second time. He fell to the floor, and the officers saw for the first time that the object in his hand was a Bible, the police said.
Robert O'Leary, first assistant Union County prosecutor, said the officers' actions were being reviewed. 
The authorities said Mr. Venuti had a history of depression and may have wanted the officers to kill him. 
One of the callers, Paul Korkidas, 60, a neighbor, said Mr. Venuti tried to break down his door only moments before the police arrived. Another neighbor, Doreen Navarro, 42, an unemployed day care worker, said she had seen Mr. Venuti walking into the building wearing only shorts and T-shirt just before the incident, asking no one in particular to call the police. "He looked upset," she said. 
Mr. Venuti's wife of 10 years, April Anthony Venuti, who was at a wedding when the shooting occurred, said her husband was unemployed and received disability payments for depression. She said the couple had decided to look for a new home.
"Mark did not do suicide by cop," she said. "We had plans."

HEADLINE: As Taxes Rise, Suburbs Work to Keep Elderly 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: WEST WINDSOR, N.J., Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Suburbs have always had one big idea, to be comfortable and safe places for families with children. But local politicians here and around the country are working hard these days to cater to a new generation of suburban V.I.P.'s -- those retired couples in the three- or four-bedroom houses down the street. People like Fred and Mary Froehlich.
 The Froehlichs love the Cape that Mr. Froehlich built with his own hands 46 years ago, when West Windsor was mostly farmland and not the vast plain of expensive houses it has become. They love the way their five grown children still come home for family gatherings. What they do not love are the taxes, $6,000 a year, which happen to be the same as Mrs. Froehlich's annual Social Security benefit. 
 So like a lot of suburban retirees, Mr. Froelich is trying to persuade his wife to move, in their case to a spot in Delaware where taxes are a tenth of what they are here. But Mrs. Froehlich is resisting, and although she may not yet know it, she has an ally in Carole Carson, the mayor of West Windsor. 
For Ms. Carson has done the math and knows what it means when retirees move out and a new generation of families with children move in. It means more children swelling enrollment at local schools, more garbage to pick up, more cars on the road, more services generally.
Since it costs an average of $9,599 a year to send a child to the West Windsor-Plainsboro public schools -- up nearly 28 percent in the past five years -- even with state aid, one new child in the Froehlich's house would more than eat up the taxes the house produces. Two more would present the school district with a $20,000 annual education bill.
The impact of enrollment growth is especially severe in growing suburbs like West Windsor, a bedroom community of 20,000 near Princeton that has seen enrollment increase to 8,500 from about 5,000 10 years ago. While a small increase in enrollment might easily be absorbed in existing classrooms, the growth here has required two school construction referendums, in 1993 and again in 1996, in which voters approved spending a total of $114.7 million to build two new elementary schools, a new high school and an addition to an existing middle school.
So like other communities around the country, West Windsor is scrambling to find ways to keep as many elderly residents in their homes as long as possible. As the population ages, the development is already changing the face of suburbia. 
"It's a matter of cost-effectiveness, especially in a community like ours," said Ms. Carson. "The seniors are a tremendous asset to any community, and if you are not able to retain them, you end up, one, without the values they represent, and, two, with services that are much more expensive than if they stayed. So we need to do what we can to keep our seniors from moving away."
So Ms. Carson is leading a statewide drive to encourage retirees to stay in their family homes by reducing the punishing level of property taxation that, in conversation after conversation with retirees here, emerged as the No. 1 complaint of empty-nesters. 
In November, the New Jersey State League of Municipalities took up her cause and is now lobbying the State Legislature to increase the income eligibility for a state program that freezes the taxes for people over 65. A version of this idea has been introduced by Jack Collins, the speaker of the Assembly, that would double the income eligibility to $44,000, from $22,000. 
Earlier this month, Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco proposed raising the property tax rebate for the elderly, a separate program, to $750, from $500, while urging the Legislature to consider Mr. Collins's legislation without quite endorsing it. This afternoon, the Senate budget committee approved Mr. DiFrancesco's proposal.
In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki has similarly proposed expanding the state's property tax rebate system for the elderly. For married homeowners earning as much as $60,000, he would raise the average benefit by an average of about $300 a year over the next five years.
In Connecticut earlier this month, Gov. John G. Rowland devoted a large part of his budget message to the need to provide more generous in-home care for the elderly, saying that the longer they are able to remain self-sufficient, the less time they will spend in state-subsidized nursing homes.
Efforts like these, plus, perhaps, a waning appeal of Sunbelt retirement communities for some elderly people, have created a new suburban phenomenon some call the N.O.R.C., for "naturally occurring retirement community," said Elinor Ginzler, manager of the Long Term and Independent Living office of AARP, the association for middle-aged and elderly Americans.
"It is a setting where folks have aged in place," Ms. Ginzler said. "And people who live there recognize that in order to encourage that, you have to address the issues like taxes that accompany that development." 
Property tax abatements are hardly the only incentive to stay put that are being offered to the suburban elderly these days. Free or discounted public transportation, free medical screening and the opportunity to audit local college courses for little or no charge are also aimed at keeping them in place.
So are the "senior centers" -- combination social clubs, gyms and clinics -- that according to the National Council on the Aging have become ubiquitous in the suburbs. There are now 16,000 around the country, double the number in 1980, and most of them are in the suburbs. 
Still, here at the leading edge of suburban sprawl, the comforts, convenience and companionship offered by such amenities do not entirely overcome the problem that high taxes present to retirees.
"Taxes are the only expenses that keep going up for them," Mayor Carson said. "Their car insurance stays the same, their houses are paid for and they don't use a lot of electricity. But taxes keep going up, and it makes it hard for them to stay in their homes." 
In 1996, the taxes on a $250,000 home in West Windsor were $6,975, including $4,300 in school taxes, said Kay Reed, the township tax collector. In 2000, the taxes on the same house had risen to $8,450, with school taxes accounting for $5,550. 
For newcomers, West Windsor's well-regarded schools and their high test scores are a source of pride, but to Dick Harbourt and his wife, Marion, the resulting taxes are unbearable. He and Mrs. Harbourt live on $22,000 a year, and even though they qualified to have their taxes frozen in 1998, nearly a quarter of their income goes to pay the $5,000 annual bill. 
"When we built our house in '55, our taxes were less than $200," said Mr. Harbourt, 69, who used to have a small trucking company. "We expanded to raise five kids, and every room I added has a memory, a history. And I feel that all the new citizens moving in here are just confiscating our home to pay for their schools." 
Sitting around a big table at West Windsor's senior center, a clapboard structure designed to look a little like a traditional farmhouse, Mr. Harbourt and a dozen friends acknowledged that an earlier generation of residents, including retirees, had helped put their own children through school 30 or 40 years ago. They said they recognized that they have a similar obligation to today's children. In addition, the quality of the schools has greatly increased the values of their homes.
That said, as communities try to cater to longtime residents, some parents are mindful of empty-nesters' reputation as consistent "no" voters on local school bonds. Indeed, almost all the people at the senior center said they regularly voted against school budgets.
Acknowledging that others had helped support schools for their children, many longtime residents say that things are different now. To begin with, the cost of education has increased much faster than inflation or their incomes.
But also, they say, the newcomers who have doubled West Windsor's population in the last 15 years are too often professional couples whose transient, corporate careers in New York and Philadelphia keep them from developing the kind of commitment to the place, to the volunteer work and to the town boards that people like the Froehlichs and the Harbourts brought in their child-rearing days. 
"You talk to the people who move in and it's always the same" said Oliver Hilpot, who has lived here with his wife, Bette, for 45 years. "They move in for the schools, and as soon as their kids are out of high school, they're gone, because they don't want to pay the taxes. Well, if they don't like the taxes, why should we?" 
A few years ago, the Hilpots gave up their big house and moved to an upscale retirement condominium in West Windsor. A young family with one child bought their house, and now a second baby is on the way. 
At their spotless home on Cubberley Road, the Froehlichs think about the $115 a week it costs them just to stay in their house and wonder. 
"I'm ready to go," Mr. Froehlich, a retired construction supervisor, said. "But she" -- a nod to his wife -- "she's still on the fence."

 NEW YORK

MINEOLA: BUDGET SURPLUS PLANS -- Republican lawmakers in Nassau County want to reserve additional money to pay down debt and interest. More than half of the $48.3 million surplus from 2000 has been set aside, and Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader of the County Legislature, said that an additional $11.3 million in 2002 should be used to pay debt. Judith A. Jacobs, the Democratic majority leader, said the idea was "not new." A spokesman for County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta said most of the suggestions were already in the county's four-year plan. Al Baker (NYT)

MANHATTAN: KERIK MAKES ANOTHER ARREST -- For the third time since becoming the police commissioner less than a year ago, Bernard B. Kerik, left, took part in a street arrest. Mr. Kerik told reporters yesterday that he was driving around the Hamilton Heights section of Harlem on Sunday with his security detail when they noticed one man chasing another. When one man got into a van on West 142nd Street, Commissioner Kerik and others detained both men. They found that the van had been reported carjacked and arrested the two men on various charges, including unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. Diane Cardwell (NYT)

WHITE PLAINS: CELL PHONE BILL APPROVED -- The Westchester County Legislature, deciding not to wait for a statewide law, voted unanimously last night to prohibit drivers from talking on hand-held cellular phones. "We as local officials have an obligation to protect our own citizenry if we can't get the state to do it for us," said Louis Mosiello, the Republican sponsor of the bill. The measure would authorize fines of up to $150 for using a phone while driving unless it can be operated hands-free or is used in an emergency. The law would go into effect 45 days after the bill was signed by County Executive Andrew J. Spano, who says he supports it. (AP)

EAST ISLIP: ARRAIGNMENT IN ANIMAL SACRIFICE -- Six people were arraigned yesterday on charges that they illegally sacrificed a pig late Sunday during a religious rite at the East Islip Marina. Officials said the six were practicing a religion similar to Santeria. Although a Supreme Court ruling protects animal sacrifices when performed as part of religious practice, law enforcement officials said the pig was not killed swiftly and cleanly, but slowly and painfully. The participants were therefore charged with a misdemeanor violation of the state's agriculture and markets law. Michael Cooper (NYT)

MANHATTAN: TOUR BUS DEMISE CHEERS MAYOR Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said good riddance yesterday to New York Apple Tours, the tour bus company that announced its permanent shutdown on Sunday. "It's a good idea that they went out of business," Mr. Giuliani said. "They were a very, very difficult operation." The red double-decker buses had been cited for more than 1,000 traffic violations. Last May, one of the company's buses struck and killed a man.

CONNECTICUT

HARTFORD: STATE ECONOMY SLOWS -- University of Connecticut professors said yesterday that reduced job growth, falling consumer confidence and higher energy prices are slowing the state's 10-year economic expansion. In a report, the economists criticized what they called an anachronistic government that made statewide strategies for managing growth more difficult. But they said the state's two casinos had produced many new jobs. (NYT)

STAMFORD: SKAKEL HEARING DELAYED -- A hearing on whether to move the murder trial of Michael Skakel, left, has been pushed back a day, to Thursday, State Superior Court announced yesterday. Judge John F. Kavanewsky Jr. is to hear arguments from prosecutors, who want the trial moved to Bridgeport, and from the defense, which is opposed. (AP)

RAHWAY: BABY'S BODY FOUND -- A dead infant wrapped in blankets was found in an abandoned car, the authorities said yesterday. Robert O'Leary, the first assistant Union County prosecutor, said the cause of death was not known. Steve Strunsky (NYT)

Inventory Problem Leads To Profit Warning at Nike
Nike said that its third-quarter profit would fall short of forecasts because of problems with an inventory system that led to shortages and late deliveries.
 To compensate for the shortages, the company said, it ordered so many shoes that it will be trying to work through excess inventory for months to come. Nike now expects to earn 34 to 38 cents a share for the quarter -- far below its previous estimate of 50 to 55 cents a share. In after-hours trading, shares of Nike fell as low as $40.30 after closing at $49.17. Page C2. 

Judges Scrutinize Microsoft Ruling
Federal appeals judges sharply questioned the decision that found that Microsoft had repeatedly violated antitrust law. The questioning suggested that many elements of the decision were vulnerable to reversal. A1.

P.& G. Cites Turkey in a Warning
Citing the economic crisis in Turkey, Procter & Gamble warned that its profits would fall as much as 4 percent in the third quarter and about 1.5 percent for the entire year. Because Procter has repeatedly warned Wall Street over the last year to scale back its expectations, some analysts questioned whether the company may have over-emphasized the effect of the Turkish currency crisis. Shares of Procter fell $3.92, to $71.11. C9.

Stocks Gain on Hopes of Rate Cut
Stocks jumped as investors bet that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again soon. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 200.63 points, or 1.9 percent, to 10,642.53. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 21.79 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,267.65. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 45.99 points, or 2 percent, to 2,308.50. C10.

Bush Alters Debate on U.S. Debt

HEADLINE: HSBC Reports Hobbled Profit For Last Year 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
HSBC Holdings reported a full-year profit today that was marred by weakened trading income and undercut by the muted recovery in Asia. The results, below many analysts' expectations, were more disheartening because of HSBC's near-term forecast.
 Sir John Bond, HSBC's chairman, warned that "the outlook for 2001 is challenging." He cited the prospect of an economic slowdown in the United States and stiffer competition in Britain and the deregulation of interest rates in Hong Kong. 
 Keith Whitson, group chief executive, said a slowdown in the United States could "have a widespread knock-on effect in many, many countries," Agence France-Presse reported.
HSBC's stock, which had been trading at a premium compared with most of its peers, fell 7 percent today in London, to 955 pence ($13.90).
Pretax profit for 2000 was $10.3 billion. Though up sharply from the 1999 figure of $8 billion, it was at the bottom of the range of forecasts. 
"Over all, the results were pretty flat, punctuated by areas that were quite poor," said Chris Ellerton of UBS Warburg. He lowered his rating on HSBC today to hold from buy.
Mr. Ellerton plans to trim his profit forecast for 2001 up to 10 percent given the storm clouds and the lack of lift in the equity markets.
Though HSBC mainly focuses on selling asset-management and other products to wealthy individuals and gets more than two-thirds of its operating profit that way, it is not immune from the vagaries of the capital markets. Its profits from trading fell 25 percent in 2000, to $1.6 billion. HSBC made $213 million trading stocks in the first half of the year but only $110 million in the second half.
Soft patches appeared in demand for loans, especially in Asia, which has come back more slowly than hoped from the economic meltdowns of the late 90's. In Hong Kong, where HSBC earns 29 percent of its interest income, loan demand grew just 7 percent last year.
Still, Asia's recovery has allowed HSBC to set aside $932 million less than it expected for problem loans, Adrian Russell, an HSBC spokesman, said.
Most of HSBC's recent growth, though, has come from acquisitions. It has spent $20 billion since 1999 to buy Credit Commercial de France and Republic New York, which together added $1.73 billion in net interest income in 2000. Sooner or later, analysts say, HSBC needs to show that it can deliver growth from existing operations.

A Man With A Plan

BYLINE:  By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
George W. Bush is making his big budget speech tonight. You remember. The president.
 While the nation has been watching the Clintons in fascinated, gaping horror, things have been going great, in an under-the-radar kind of way, for the current incumbent, a Republican who was formerly the governor of Texas. 
 Mr. Bush, whose father once served as president of the United States, lives in a sunny land of low expectations, full of triumphant meet-and-greets. And he looks like a statesman every time he gets through a day without pardoning anybody. 
(PARDON NEWS BULLETIN: Robert Wendell Walker Jr., a bank robber who was pardoned by Ronald Reagan in 1981, is currently on trial on charges of killing his wife and dismembering and burning her body. We now take you back to the previously scheduled column.)
As we were saying, the members of Congress turn out to have exactly the same reaction to Mr. Bush as the country at large. They like everything about him except his ideas. His Medicare drug plan elicited an energetic bipartisan response, with both parties stomping on it until there was nothing left but a thin legislative grease spot.
The voucher part of his education initiative is D.O.A., and the Republicans are probably going to water down the testing part to meaningless gibberish. There is still the spending-more-money part, which turns out to be a spending-less-money part if you compare it with what Congress did in the Clinton administration.
Over the past month Mr. Bush has also come up with a plan to funnel more money to religious groups, which the Scientologists love and Pat Robertson hates. And he bombed Iraq, using ultra-modern precision-guided weapons, which generally missed.
But then, he didn't pardon anybody. And I hear some people he really likes are getting two or even three nicknames.
Tonight Mr. Bush, the father of two whose wife is a former librarian, is going to officially ask Congress to approve his $1.6 trillion tax cut. He says we need it because "a warning light is flashing on the dashboard of our economy," and there will be perilous times ahead unless the consumer confidence cruise control is completely operational.
The president has been selling this plan forever. During the campaign he went all around the nation, announcing that one of his top priorities was to cut the 39 percent marginal tax rate for extremely high-income Americans. When people asked why, he always said, "We don't believe anybody should ever pay more than 33 percent." Amazingly, nobody once yelled back, "Say what?"
No wonder he thought he had a winner. Still, there is not enough support in the Senate right now to pass it, even though the Democrats have not come up with a specific alternative. When the opposition held a press conference the other day to denounce the Bush plan, somebody asked the minority leader, Tom Daschle, what his followers wanted the tax cut to be.
"We want it to be fair," he said helpfully.
But the most interesting part of the tax fight has been the long parade of rich people who've been marching to the Capitol to beg Congress not to give them any more money. Warren Buffett, George Soros, Bill Gates's father -- sometimes it seemed as if the only obscenely rich people in Washington who liked tax cuts were in Mr. Bush's cabinet. "Frankly, I don't need a break," said Senator Jon Corzine, the New Jersey Democrat who estimated that the Bush tax cut plan would save him $1 million a year.
Congress is going to pass a big whopping tax cut, but Mr. Bush has been pretty clear that he wants his version, the one that gives Jon Corzine a million bucks, not some scrawny $800 billion sop to the middle class. "The president wants to see passed the bill he ran on and was elected on," said the chief economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsey, beaming with the sort of confidence normally associated only with chief executives who won the popular vote.
Tonight we'll begin to find out if Mr. Bush, a graduate of Yale and the owner of a dog named Spot, can talk the nation into believing that tax relief "pumps adrenaline into troubled economies," multiplying the endorphins of economic growth and increasing the insulin of employment. Not to mention fixing that darned light on the dashboard.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Energy Bill Is Likely to Set Off Fierce Policy Fight 

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Declaring that the nation faced an energy crisis threatening its security and economy, Senate Republicans today proposed the first major bill in a decade to overhaul energy policy and spur domestic oil exploration.
 The bill, presented by Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is expected to unleash one of the year's fiercest policy debates pitting business groups led by the oil industry against conservationists. The measure's introduction comes after rolling power cutbacks in California, a problem Republicans say will give their bill fresh momentum. 
 Central to Mr. Murkowski's bill is a provision to permit oil drilling inside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a wilderness area in Alaska's north slope. That proposal has met with strong resistance in Congress in the past and is vehemently opposed by many Democrats and some Republicans, who say it would needlessly disrupt the refuge. 
"American dependence on foreign oil threatens our national security and our freedom, and we need to recognize that," Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said today on the Senate floor in support of drilling in the refuge.
Supporters of the drilling proposal say high natural gas prices are the legacy of the country's failure to adopt a comprehensive energy policy. Still, they acknowledge that opening the wildlife refuge to drilling would not produce benefits for consumers for at least five years.
Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, has threatened to filibuster any bill that would permit drilling in the refuge. And in the Senate, any pro-oil industry measure is certain to face legislative hurdles raised by Democrats.
President Bush, a former oil executive, is a strong supporter of drilling in Alaska, but the package of tax breaks intended to encourage exploration goes far beyond the tax credits Mr. Bush mentioned in his own energy plan on the campaign trail. The Senate package could also run into conflict with Mr. Bush's vow to push through in his $1.6 trillion tax cut plan with no changes.
Mr. Bush has directed Vice President Dick Cheney to create a task force on energy policy and to work with Congress on steering a bill through Congress by this summer.
The White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said Mr. Murkowski's bill was off to "a very good start."
Mr. Murkowski's 300-page bill is intended to reduce the nation's use of foreign oil to 50 percent, down from the current 56 percent, by opening up new tracts of land for oil exploration. The bill would also promote the production of natural gas, coal and nuclear energy and increase home-heating assistance for the poor.
The bill includes numerous tax breaks to spur oil and natural gas production, promote solar and wind energy and encourage nuclear power plants to produce more electricity. Some of the provisions are intended to attract Democrats by offering tax breaks for people who buy energy-saving cars and appliances.
But some Democrats instantly cited the bill as an example of the kind of frenzy for tax cuts that could take place this year, calling it an ornament on the Christmas tree," as one Democratic aide put it. Mr. Bush used similar language last week in saying he would resist demands to add more tax breaks to his plan.
Taxpayer groups immediately attacked the bill today as a boon to oil and utility companies, industries that contribute heavily to the Republican Party, and said the bill would cost taxpayers at least $21 billion in subsidies and tax breaks to energy companies. The total cost of the bill is still being calculated by the Congressional Budget Office.
"The bill will not solve the energy crisis, but will make already profitable companies even wealthier," said Cena Swisher, program director for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group in Washington that monitors federal spending.
The legislation, for example, would benefit big oil companies by reducing the federal royalties they pay when the price of oil falls below $18 a barrel and natural gas prices drop below $2.30 per thousand cubic feet for 90 straight days.
Oil companies that deal with small-scale wells would be awarded tax credits when prices fall as a way to provide an incentive to keep such wells operating. Owners of so-called stripper wells would get a tax credit of $3 per barrel when oil prices fall below $15 a barrel and a 50 cent tax credit on each 1,000 cubic feet of gas produced when gas prices drop below $2 per thousand cubic feet.
Mr. Murkowski said he sought to balance the need for a sound energy policy and the concerns of environmental groups and conservationists. 
But Mr. Murkowski, along with other Republican leaders, emphasized that his chief aim was to increase oil production in the United States and reduce the country's reliance on oil imported from "unstable nations" like Iraq and Iran. The United States imports 750,000 barrels of oil a day from Iraq.
For this reason, he said, drilling in the Alaskan refuge, which is often referred to by its initials, A.N.W.R., makes sense. "The reality of A.N.W.R. is that if you are looking to increase supply, you look at where you are mostly likely to find it."
The federal government estimates that the refuge's coastal plain could hold from 3.2 billion to 16 billion barrels of extractable oil. Mr. Murkowski said oil drilling technology had vastly improved over the years and would do little harm to the refuge and the migrating caribou.
"It can replace the oil we buy from Saudi Arabia for the next 30 years," he said.
In 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed a bill that made Alaskan land a refuge of 19 million acres, an area the size of North Carolina. Mr. Carter carved out 1.5 million acres for possible oil exploration if Congress voted to authorize the drilling.
In an interview today, Mr. Carter said that he opposed Mr. Murkowski's bill just as most major environmental groups do. "I feel that this is ill-advised legislation that would despoil a precious area of our country for a very small and trenchant amount of oil," Mr. Carter said. "Just imagine this happening on the edge of Yellowstone National Park or Yosemite."
Mr. Carter and other Democrats also said the bill failed to address fuel consumption by including restrictions on the number of sport utility vehicles and light trucks. 
"We can't even talk about a comprehensive energy policy without concrete policies to reduce oil demand," said Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the ranking Democrat on the committee. "We cannot produce our way to independence from foreign oil supplies."
All day today, Republicans took to the Senate floor and issued news releases to promote their energy bill, saying that California's problems are a harbinger for the rest of the nation. They all cast the debate as a foreign policy issue, raising the possibility that foreign nations could manipulate the United States by withholding supplies or pushing up crude oil prices. 
For decades, Republicans have pushed to open up broad swaths of the United States to further oil and natural gas exploration, only to be stymied by Democrats and environmental groups.
"We have allowed this drift to go on too long," said Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska. "We can't leave this country subject to international blackmail because of our reliance on foreign oil. It's far too dangerous."

HEADLINE: HSBC Reports Hobbled Profit For Last Year 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
HSBC Holdings reported a full-year profit today that was marred by weakened trading income and undercut by the muted recovery in Asia. The results, below many analysts' expectations, were more disheartening because of HSBC's near-term forecast.
 Sir John Bond, HSBC's chairman, warned that "the outlook for 2001 is challenging." He cited the prospect of an economic slowdown in the United States and stiffer competition in Britain and the deregulation of interest rates in Hong Kong. 
 Keith Whitson, group chief executive, said a slowdown in the United States could "have a widespread knock-on effect in many, many countries," Agence France-Presse reported.
HSBC's stock, which had been trading at a premium compared with most of its peers, fell 7 percent today in London, to 955 pence ($13.90).
Pretax profit for 2000 was $10.3 billion. Though up sharply from the 1999 figure of $8 billion, it was at the bottom of the range of forecasts. 
"Over all, the results were pretty flat, punctuated by areas that were quite poor," said Chris Ellerton of UBS Warburg. He lowered his rating on HSBC today to hold from buy.
Mr. Ellerton plans to trim his profit forecast for 2001 up to 10 percent given the storm clouds and the lack of lift in the equity markets.
Though HSBC mainly focuses on selling asset-management and other products to wealthy individuals and gets more than two-thirds of its operating profit that way, it is not immune from the vagaries of the capital markets. Its profits from trading fell 25 percent in 2000, to $1.6 billion. HSBC made $213 million trading stocks in the first half of the year but only $110 million in the second half.
Soft patches appeared in demand for loans, especially in Asia, which has come back more slowly than hoped from the economic meltdowns of the late 90's. In Hong Kong, where HSBC earns 29 percent of its interest income, loan demand grew just 7 percent last year.
Still, Asia's recovery has allowed HSBC to set aside $932 million less than it expected for problem loans, Adrian Russell, an HSBC spokesman, said.
Most of HSBC's recent growth, though, has come from acquisitions. It has spent $20 billion since 1999 to buy Credit Commercial de France and Republic New York, which together added $1.73 billion in net interest income in 2000. Sooner or later, analysts say, HSBC needs to show that it can deliver growth from existing operations.

HEADLINE: A New Script For Greenspan At House Panel 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, will offer revised testimony on the United States economy and monetary policy when he appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, a Fed spokesman said today.
 Mr. Greenspan testified before the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 13, as part of his semiannual briefings to Congress. 
 "Some time has passed since the last testimony," the spokesman, David Skidmore, said. "The chairman is updating the text."
Mr. Greenspan typically repeats the text of his monetary policy report in the Senate and House committee appearances. His statement is supposed to reflect the views of all members of the central bank's policy-making Open Market Committee, not just his own.
Under a law passed last year, the chairman is required to appear before only one of the two Congressional panels, with the House and Senate taking turns. While this year his House appearance was not required, members of the Financial Services Committee -- the former House Banking Committee with additional securities and insurance jurisdiction -- requested that he appear.
Diane Swonk, chief economist at Bank One in Chicago, called the Fed chief's forthcoming remarks "an important development."
"It shows how responsive they are to economic conditions," she said. "They haven't predetermined policy. They want to make it clear they're willing to do whatever's necessary for the economy."
Speaking to the senators two weeks ago, Mr. Greenspan said the United States would probably avoid recession this year as businesses reduced their stockpiles of unsold goods and continued to invest in technology that promoted productivity. "If the forces contributing to long-term productivity growth remain intact," he said, "the degree of retrenchment will presumably be limited."
Since then, the Fed has received mixed signals on the economy, with confidence strengthening but still weak and prices rising faster than expected.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup; 
Justices Press for Clarity in a Property Rights Dispute

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court has struggled for years over how and when to apply the Fifth Amendment's injunction that private property shall not be "taken for public use without just compensation," and an argument today over whether an environmental regulation that barred development on 18 acres of oceanfront wetlands in Rhode Island amounted to a "taking" did not necessarily bring the justices any closer to a clear answer.
 Like nearly all such cases, this 30-year-old land-use dispute reached the court in a tangled procedural state presenting numerous obstacles to a broad, clarifying ruling. 
 But it has drawn wide attention in property-rights and environmental circles because it offers a vehicle for the court finally to create the kind of expansive takings doctrine that recent cases have been inching toward. An expansive definition of a taking would make land-use regulation much more expensive for all levels of government. 
One major question in the case today was whether a property owner who acquired land after a regulation was in place was "on notice" of the development restrictions and therefore barred from claiming entitlement for compensation for a taking.
While there is some dispute about the chronology in this case, the landowner, Anthony Palazzolo, became sole owner of the waterfront property in 1978, several years after both Rhode Island and the federal government began to regulate the filling of coastal wetlands. Mr. Palazzolo and his corporate partners acquired the land, in the town of Westerly, in the late 1950's and early 1960's for about $13,000.
Mr. Palazzolo's lawyer argued that because waterfront owners in Rhode Island historically enjoyed the right to fill wetlands on their property without government regulation, the state could not curb that freedom today, even for landowners who acquired the land with knowledge of the regulations, without paying compensation for a taking.
Several justices found this assertion startling. "If the rights to land use pass from owner to owner, how far back does it go?" Justice David H. Souter asked. "There is no logical stopping place until you get back to Roger Williams and the 17th-century settlement." 
James S. Burling, Mr. Palazzolo's lawyer, replied that a current landowner's rights date "as far back as before the existence of pervasive regulation." A landowner retains the right to development even after acquiring the property with knowledge of modern regulations, Mr. Burling said, explaining that a new regulation "doesn't affect the background principles of the very property itself" like the historic right to fill waterfront land.
"If the background principle of filling wetlands cannot be tampered with," Justice Souter persisted, how about "the background principle of building to the property line?" Could an ordinary zoning setback requirement amount to a taking? he asked.
Mr. Burling replied that "reasonable" zoning requirements would not necessarily be a taking. Leaping forcibly into the argument, Justice Antonin Scalia, the court's leading advocate of a broad theory of takings, expressed alarm that Mr. Burling's answer was not firm enough.
A 60-foot setback might sound reasonable, Justice Scalia said, but wouldn't it be a taking if the property was only 61 feet deep?
"I'd better define 'reasonable,' " Mr. Burling replied, a bit sheepishly. If the regulation "destroys the economically viable use of the property," it is a taking, he said.
Justice Souter found this unsatisfactory. "So it's simply the economics of what came before and what came after?" he asked. "I don't think you want to take that position. Do you look to the reasons for the state regulation? You're going to have to come up with some criteria of what passes muster and what does not."
The Rhode Island Supreme Court rejected Mr. Palazzolo's taking claim on the ground that his lawsuit was not "ripe." In his lawsuit, filed in 1988, he was seeking more than $3 million in damages to make up for the profit he said he would have made by subdividing his property and building 74 single-family homes. 
But he had not sought permission to build the houses. Instead he had filed one application to fill in the land for unspecified purposes and another to use the land for a beach club. Both were denied. One question in the case, Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, No. 99-2047, is how precise a land-use application must be in order for its rejection to be considered a sufficient basis for a takings lawsuit.
Specificity was essential, Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island told the justices, because the takings claim must be evaluated in light of whatever economic value remained in the land after one specific use was rejected. "There is value in this property," Mr. Whitehouse said, "perhaps a good deal."
Denial of the landfill permit left Mr. Palazzolo free to build a single family house on a dry "upland" part of the property, with an estimated value of $200,000. A court must evaluate the entire parcel in any takings case, Mr. Whitehouse said, or else a takings claim "is ipso facto always going to be 100 percent as to the burdened portion," the part where development has been rejected.
Mr. Palazzolo's legal representation was provided by the Pacific Legal Foundation, an organization, based in Sacramento, that specializes in property rights and has brought several takings cases to the Supreme Court. The Clinton administration, in its waning weeks, filed a brief on Rhode Island's behalf, and Malcolm L. Stewart, an assistant solicitor general, argued on Rhode Island's side today.
While the Justice Department in the Bush administration is likely to be more sympathetic to the property-rights side of the takings argument, it may find itself constrained by the financial consequences of a broad takings doctrine. Signing briefs on Rhode Island's side were the National Conference of State Legislatures, the National League of Cities, the National Governors Association and 18 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

Disability Act Cases
In other action today, the justices stepped back temporarily from the federalism debate and, without comment, turned down nine cases that presented to the states a variety of issues concerning the application of the Americans With Disabilities Act.
While several of these were essentially identical to the case the court decided last week, immunizing states from discrimination suits by their disabled employees, others posed new questions under the statute, like the validity of extra fees that some states charge for handicapped parking stickers. New cases under the disability act are likely to reach the court soon, prompted by last week's ruling in Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett.

Abortion Practices Law
Also without comment, the court turned down a constitutional challenge to a South Carolina law imposing a variety of special staffing, administrative and physical requirements on the offices of doctors who perform five or more first-trimester abortions a month. The regulations were upheld by a 2-to-1 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond. Several doctors and abortion clinics had objected that the regulations were medically unnecessary and would raise costs, making safe, early abortions less available. The case was Greenville Women's Clinic v. Bryant, No. 00-798.

A Man With A Plan

BYLINE:  By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
George W. Bush is making his big budget speech tonight. You remember. The president.
 While the nation has been watching the Clintons in fascinated, gaping horror, things have been going great, in an under-the-radar kind of way, for the current incumbent, a Republican who was formerly the governor of Texas. 
 Mr. Bush, whose father once served as president of the United States, lives in a sunny land of low expectations, full of triumphant meet-and-greets. And he looks like a statesman every time he gets through a day without pardoning anybody. 
(PARDON NEWS BULLETIN: Robert Wendell Walker Jr., a bank robber who was pardoned by Ronald Reagan in 1981, is currently on trial on charges of killing his wife and dismembering and burning her body. We now take you back to the previously scheduled column.)
As we were saying, the members of Congress turn out to have exactly the same reaction to Mr. Bush as the country at large. They like everything about him except his ideas. His Medicare drug plan elicited an energetic bipartisan response, with both parties stomping on it until there was nothing left but a thin legislative grease spot.
The voucher part of his education initiative is D.O.A., and the Republicans are probably going to water down the testing part to meaningless gibberish. There is still the spending-more-money part, which turns out to be a spending-less-money part if you compare it with what Congress did in the Clinton administration.
Over the past month Mr. Bush has also come up with a plan to funnel more money to religious groups, which the Scientologists love and Pat Robertson hates. And he bombed Iraq, using ultra-modern precision-guided weapons, which generally missed.
But then, he didn't pardon anybody. And I hear some people he really likes are getting two or even three nicknames.
Tonight Mr. Bush, the father of two whose wife is a former librarian, is going to officially ask Congress to approve his $1.6 trillion tax cut. He says we need it because "a warning light is flashing on the dashboard of our economy," and there will be perilous times ahead unless the consumer confidence cruise control is completely operational.
The president has been selling this plan forever. During the campaign he went all around the nation, announcing that one of his top priorities was to cut the 39 percent marginal tax rate for extremely high-income Americans. When people asked why, he always said, "We don't believe anybody should ever pay more than 33 percent." Amazingly, nobody once yelled back, "Say what?"
No wonder he thought he had a winner. Still, there is not enough support in the Senate right now to pass it, even though the Democrats have not come up with a specific alternative. When the opposition held a press conference the other day to denounce the Bush plan, somebody asked the minority leader, Tom Daschle, what his followers wanted the tax cut to be.
"We want it to be fair," he said helpfully.
But the most interesting part of the tax fight has been the long parade of rich people who've been marching to the Capitol to beg Congress not to give them any more money. Warren Buffett, George Soros, Bill Gates's father -- sometimes it seemed as if the only obscenely rich people in Washington who liked tax cuts were in Mr. Bush's cabinet. "Frankly, I don't need a break," said Senator Jon Corzine, the New Jersey Democrat who estimated that the Bush tax cut plan would save him $1 million a year.
Congress is going to pass a big whopping tax cut, but Mr. Bush has been pretty clear that he wants his version, the one that gives Jon Corzine a million bucks, not some scrawny $800 billion sop to the middle class. "The president wants to see passed the bill he ran on and was elected on," said the chief economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsey, beaming with the sort of confidence normally associated only with chief executives who won the popular vote.
Tonight we'll begin to find out if Mr. Bush, a graduate of Yale and the owner of a dog named Spot, can talk the nation into believing that tax relief "pumps adrenaline into troubled economies," multiplying the endorphins of economic growth and increasing the insulin of employment. Not to mention fixing that darned light on the dashboard.

HEADLINE: POWELL PROPOSES EASING SANCTIONS ON IRAQI CIVILIANS 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Tuesday, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said on Monday that he had won agreement from Arab nations on a plan to modify sanctions on Iraq by letting in more civilian supplies but sharpening controls on strategic items sought by President Saddam Hussein.
 Some American allies in the Middle East and Europe have been calling for a change of the sanctions, but now that his tour of the Middle East is over, General Powell faces a fierce debate in the Bush administration on Iraq policy. He acknowledged that there would be many questions about his plan from hard-liners in Washington. 
 General Powell said none of the Arab leaders he met with in the last three days, including President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, whom he saw on Monday, disagreed with his strategy. "Everyone I spoke to said you've got to go down this track; it's the right thing to do," General Powell said. 
"The message I've consistently heard is that overdoing it with the sanctions gives him a tool that he is using against us -- and really is not weakening him," General Powell said of President Hussein. 
But he said his outline of a plan would be criticized in Washington. "The charges will come that it is weakening," he said. "There will be a lot of people who will want to hear more."
Some hard-liners in Congress and the administration want tougher action, including the arming of Iraqi opposition groups, in an attempt to overthrow Mr. Hussein.
General Powell, speaking to reporters as he flew from Damascus to Brussels late on Monday, seemed to be setting up a test of strength in the administration's foreign policy apparatus, which includes Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, Vice President Dick Cheney and the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Cheney are believed to be more favorably disposed to arming the opposition groups. Mr. Rumsfeld's newly nominated deputy, Paul D. Wolfowitz, has publicly advocated that policy.
There are others in the administration who agree, believing that the unfinished business of the Persian Gulf war 10 years ago should be completed by the ouster of Mr. Hussein. At ceremonies in Kuwait City today, former President George Bush, General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, General Powell and other leaders of the war commemorated the coalition victory against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
General Powell spent his three days in the Middle East soliciting support for his sanctions plan, which he said would tighten restrictions on Iraq so that Mr. Hussein would not be able to arm his nation with weapons of mass destruction.
As part of his new strategy, Mr. Powell said he had won agreement from Syria to place into a United Nations escrow account revenues that Mr. Hussein was receiving from oil flowing through Syrian pipelines. In the last few months, those revenues have been going into Mr. Hussein's pockets, illustrating the fraying of the sanctions. 
The commitment from the Syrian was so firm -- Mr. Assad stated it three times during the meeting, General Powell said -- that the secretary said he had telephoned President Bush to tell him. 
In another development in Syria, General Powell said Mr. Assad had agreed to an American suggestion that peace talks between Syria and Israel could proceed on a parallel track with Palestinian-Israeli talks, if the occasion arose. Talks between Israel and Syria broke down last year during the Clinton administration, which held to the idea that it was possible to conduct only one track of peace talks at a time. 
In outlining his plan, General Powell said a lot still needed to be worked out before an Arab League summit meeting in late March in Amman, Jordan, where he said he would like to see a formal consensus. He said he also wanted to take the plan to Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, and the five permanent members of the Security Council. Two of them, Russia and France, have acted in the past to soften the sanctions. 
Among the details that need to be sorted out, General Powell said, was how to better seal the borders into Iraq in order to control the smuggling of items that could help the Iraqi leader make powerful weapons. He also said he wanted to review items like refrigerated trucks, water pumps and other items with dual uses that have been blocked by the United States and other nations in the United Nations sanctions committee.
As General Powell took his argument to five Arab countries -- Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Syria -- his mission was helped by his personal stature as the top commander in the gulf war, and his ability to renew friendships in the region, senior Arab diplomats said. General Powell is close to King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, and is well known to the Kuwaitis. 
He was received as a "secretary of state plus," a diplomat said. Another said he was greeted as an "old friend." 
Those two diplomats said they believed that General Powell's trip as the first representative of the new Bush administration to visit the Middle East would strengthen his hand in the coming debate among Bush foreign policy officials. 
"He is the only one who can say, 'I have been out there,' " said one of the diplomats, alluding to General Powell's skepticism about arming Iraqi opposition movements. Other administration officials have said they favor that course of action, which would be very unpopular in the region.
In his confirmation hearings last month, General Powell expressed strong skepticism about arming opposition groups, saying it would be very difficult for the United States to do so with any degree of success. In contrast, Dr. Wolfowitz wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine in the spring of 1999 that "the United States, should be prepared to commit ground forces to protect a sanctuary in southern Iraq where the opposition could safely mobilize."
Enthusiasm for the General Powell's ideas varied by country. 
The reception was the coolest in Egypt, an important American ally where President Hosni Mubarak has upgraded diplomatic relations with Iraq and is considering a trade policy with Mr. Hussein. After General Powell's meeting there, a senior State Department official said, the Egyptians offered no ideas.
In Jordan, General Powell said King Abdullah, who rules over the most pro-Iraqi population in the region, wanted to help. But Jordan would need financial assistance in securing its border with Iraq and does not want to be discriminated against as the only bordering state to have to tighten up, the secretary said. 
As he moved form capital to capital, General Powell brought military precision to usually phlegmatic diplomatic schedules. Some meetings with leaders lasted only an hour, and his aircraft often took off ahead of schedule.
Unlike his predecessor, Madeleine K. Albright, General Powell talked frequently on the record to reporters traveling with him as he aggressively pushed his sanctions plan.
 --------------------

Extensive Talks at U.N.
 UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 26 (Reuters) -- Despite harsh statements from Iraq, Secretary General Annan said today that officials from Baghdad were looking for a way to work through the deadlock over trade sanctions.
He made the comment through a spokesman at the end of the first of two days of talks between a high-level delegation from Baghdad and United Nations officials trying to resolve the breach, which is linked to allowing arms inspectors back into Iraq.
"The Iraqis made a comprehensive case in long discussions with the secretary general," said a United Nations spokesman, Fred Eckhard. "The secretary general described the atmosphere as good, and said the Iraqis shared his perspective that we should look for a way out of the current impasse."
The two sides, which reviewed disarmament and relief issues today, will meet again on Tuesday, with Mr. Annan hoping that the Iraqis will share their views "on where we go from here," Mr. Eckhard added.
Publicly, statements by the Iraqi foreign minister, Muhammad Saeed al-Sahaf, appeared harsher than what may have evolved during the meeting. Mr. Sahaf told reporters that no inspectors would return to Iraq even if the sanctions were abolished. If they did, they had to visit all countries in the region and "first Israel because they have atomic arsenals and all other arsenals."
Western diplomats said the meetings would be considered a success if Iraq acknowledged that the sessions were a prelude to further discussions.

U.S. STEEL TO RAISE PRICES, CITING RISE IN DEMAND

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 USX-U.S. Steel, a division of the USX Corporation, said yesterday that it would raise prices $30 to $40 a ton beginning Thursday on most of its steel products in anticipation of an economic recovery. U.S. Steel, based in Pittsburgh, said it would increase its prices for hot-rolled steel by 20 percent, or $40 a ton, and those for cold-rolled and coated steel by $30 a ton. The company also said it had raised prices on Feb. 11 for its plate steel products by $10 to $15 a ton. Hot-rolled steel now sells for $200 a ton and cold-rolled steel sells for $380 to $440 a ton, said Waldo Best, a steel analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. U.S. Steel said it had seen signs, like a small but fluctuating increase in demand, to justify a price increase.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Energy Bill Is Likely to Set Off Fierce Policy Fight 

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Declaring that the nation faced an energy crisis threatening its security and economy, Senate Republicans today proposed the first major bill in a decade to overhaul energy policy and spur domestic oil exploration.
 The bill, presented by Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is expected to unleash one of the year's fiercest policy debates pitting business groups led by the oil industry against conservationists. The measure's introduction comes after rolling power cutbacks in California, a problem Republicans say will give their bill fresh momentum. 
 Central to Mr. Murkowski's bill is a provision to permit oil drilling inside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a wilderness area in Alaska's north slope. That proposal has met with strong resistance in Congress in the past and is vehemently opposed by many Democrats and some Republicans, who say it would needlessly disrupt the refuge. 
"American dependence on foreign oil threatens our national security and our freedom, and we need to recognize that," Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said today on the Senate floor in support of drilling in the refuge.
Supporters of the drilling proposal say high natural gas prices are the legacy of the country's failure to adopt a comprehensive energy policy. Still, they acknowledge that opening the wildlife refuge to drilling would not produce benefits for consumers for at least five years.
Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, has threatened to filibuster any bill that would permit drilling in the refuge. And in the Senate, any pro-oil industry measure is certain to face legislative hurdles raised by Democrats.
President Bush, a former oil executive, is a strong supporter of drilling in Alaska, but the package of tax breaks intended to encourage exploration goes far beyond the tax credits Mr. Bush mentioned in his own energy plan on the campaign trail. The Senate package could also run into conflict with Mr. Bush's vow to push through in his $1.6 trillion tax cut plan with no changes.
Mr. Bush has directed Vice President Dick Cheney to create a task force on energy policy and to work with Congress on steering a bill through Congress by this summer.
The White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said Mr. Murkowski's bill was off to "a very good start."
Mr. Murkowski's 300-page bill is intended to reduce the nation's use of foreign oil to 50 percent, down from the current 56 percent, by opening up new tracts of land for oil exploration. The bill would also promote the production of natural gas, coal and nuclear energy and increase home-heating assistance for the poor.
The bill includes numerous tax breaks to spur oil and natural gas production, promote solar and wind energy and encourage nuclear power plants to produce more electricity. Some of the provisions are intended to attract Democrats by offering tax breaks for people who buy energy-saving cars and appliances.
But some Democrats instantly cited the bill as an example of the kind of frenzy for tax cuts that could take place this year, calling it an ornament on the Christmas tree," as one Democratic aide put it. Mr. Bush used similar language last week in saying he would resist demands to add more tax breaks to his plan.
Taxpayer groups immediately attacked the bill today as a boon to oil and utility companies, industries that contribute heavily to the Republican Party, and said the bill would cost taxpayers at least $21 billion in subsidies and tax breaks to energy companies. The total cost of the bill is still being calculated by the Congressional Budget Office.
"The bill will not solve the energy crisis, but will make already profitable companies even wealthier," said Cena Swisher, program director for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group in Washington that monitors federal spending.
The legislation, for example, would benefit big oil companies by reducing the federal royalties they pay when the price of oil falls below $18 a barrel and natural gas prices drop below $2.30 per thousand cubic feet for 90 straight days.
Oil companies that deal with small-scale wells would be awarded tax credits when prices fall as a way to provide an incentive to keep such wells operating. Owners of so-called stripper wells would get a tax credit of $3 per barrel when oil prices fall below $15 a barrel and a 50 cent tax credit on each 1,000 cubic feet of gas produced when gas prices drop below $2 per thousand cubic feet.
Mr. Murkowski said he sought to balance the need for a sound energy policy and the concerns of environmental groups and conservationists. 
But Mr. Murkowski, along with other Republican leaders, emphasized that his chief aim was to increase oil production in the United States and reduce the country's reliance on oil imported from "unstable nations" like Iraq and Iran. The United States imports 750,000 barrels of oil a day from Iraq.
For this reason, he said, drilling in the Alaskan refuge, which is often referred to by its initials, A.N.W.R., makes sense. "The reality of A.N.W.R. is that if you are looking to increase supply, you look at where you are mostly likely to find it."
The federal government estimates that the refuge's coastal plain could hold from 3.2 billion to 16 billion barrels of extractable oil. Mr. Murkowski said oil drilling technology had vastly improved over the years and would do little harm to the refuge and the migrating caribou.
"It can replace the oil we buy from Saudi Arabia for the next 30 years," he said.
In 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed a bill that made Alaskan land a refuge of 19 million acres, an area the size of North Carolina. Mr. Carter carved out 1.5 million acres for possible oil exploration if Congress voted to authorize the drilling.
In an interview today, Mr. Carter said that he opposed Mr. Murkowski's bill just as most major environmental groups do. "I feel that this is ill-advised legislation that would despoil a precious area of our country for a very small and trenchant amount of oil," Mr. Carter said. "Just imagine this happening on the edge of Yellowstone National Park or Yosemite."
Mr. Carter and other Democrats also said the bill failed to address fuel consumption by including restrictions on the number of sport utility vehicles and light trucks. 
"We can't even talk about a comprehensive energy policy without concrete policies to reduce oil demand," said Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the ranking Democrat on the committee. "We cannot produce our way to independence from foreign oil supplies."
All day today, Republicans took to the Senate floor and issued news releases to promote their energy bill, saying that California's problems are a harbinger for the rest of the nation. They all cast the debate as a foreign policy issue, raising the possibility that foreign nations could manipulate the United States by withholding supplies or pushing up crude oil prices. 
For decades, Republicans have pushed to open up broad swaths of the United States to further oil and natural gas exploration, only to be stymied by Democrats and environmental groups.
"We have allowed this drift to go on too long," said Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska. "We can't leave this country subject to international blackmail because of our reliance on foreign oil. It's far too dangerous."

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT TO SEEK CUTS OF $2 TRILLION OF DEBT IN DECADE 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
In his address to Congress on Tuesday night and in the budget plan he will unveil on Wednesday, President Bush will seek to put the nation on a course to pay off $2 trillion of the national debt over the next 10 years, leaving $1.2 trillion of debt at the end of that period. 
 After several years of bipartisan consensus about the desirability of extinguishing as much debt as quickly as possible, with the goal of bringing it to zero in a decade or a little longer, Mr. Bush will say that bringing it below $1.2 trillion in that period, much less wiping it out entirely, will be all but impossible, White House officials said today. 
 The reasons are technical. But the political and economic repercussions could be substantial, affecting both this year's battle over tax cuts and spending and long-range problems like the dire financial outlook for Social Security. The president is also expected to announce the creation of a commission to make recommendations on how to deal with Social Security's long-term problems. 
The debt issue has been raised in recent months by economists including Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and by budget analysts at the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
But by highlighting it in his first budget, Mr. Bush is starting a new chapter in the debate over how the nation can best use the projected federal budget surplus, estimated at $5.6 trillion over the next decade.
Mr. Bush's budget plan will conclude that the national debt held by the public, which is projected to decline by the next fiscal year in October to just under $3.2 trillion, can be cut by $2 trillion over the subsequent decade, leaving $1.2 trillion in debt at the end of the 10-year period covered by the budget. The debt held by the public is currently $3.4 trillion.
White House officials said their position is not the result of a political or a policy decision, but a reflection of the fact that a portion of the debt in the form of a variety of bonds is not easily redeemable, either because it would be too expensive to do so or because its holders would be unwilling to part with it.
Debt reduction has proven extremely popular with voters, somewhat to the surprise of both parties. Democrats have made it a central element of their economic agenda and a first line of defense against calls by Mr. Bush and other Republicans for a big tax cut. In the presidential campaign, Mr. Bush's opponent, Al Gore, said he would seek to eliminate the debt by 2012.
Although the White House said today that it remains committed to reducing as much of the debt as possible, Republicans generally have been less convinced that debt reduction is any more potent an economic tool than tax cuts. And although economists tend to favor debt reduction as an efficient way of offsetting the nation's anemic savings rate, there is considerable debate among them about whether eliminating the debt should be the policy goal.
"The only debt that remains would be debt that it's not in the interest of the country or the taxpayers or the bondholders to have paid off," said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman.
Democrats said the administration was exaggerating the scale of the problem and undermining one of the pillars of economic progress in recent years. They called the approach a budgetary ploy by the White House to make more room for Mr. Bush's long list of campaign promises, from a $1.6 trillion tax cut to a new generation of weaponry for the Pentagon and private investment accounts for all workers.
"A remarkable consensus emerged at the end of President Clinton's second term to use the Medicare and Social Security surpluses to completely pay off our national debt," said Gene Sperling, who was Mr. Clinton's economic policy adviser and is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. "The new administration is seeking to up-end that consensus with a very questionable and misleading budget presentation to make their tax cut seem more responsible than it is."
White House officials said the $1.2 trillion in debt that cannot readily be extinguished includes a variety of government securities. Among them are savings bonds, bonds held by other nations, long-term bonds that do not mature until after 2011, and special bonds held by state and local governments. To buy back the nonredeemable debt would require paying more than the value of the bonds.
The administration's budget anticipates paying down $2 trillion in public debt that matures no later than 2011 out of the part of the projected surplus coming from Social Security -- about $2.5 trillion out of the total surplus of $5.6 trillion. The debt held by the public excludes $2.5 trillion the government owes to itself, largely in the form of promises to pay future Social Security benefits. 
"The maximum amount of debt the government could repurchase by 2011 without paying a premium is $2 trillion," said Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser. "To buy any of the additional debt would cost the taxpayer more than one dollar for every dollar of debt retired. We'd have to pay a penalty." 
The approach would leave $500 billion or so of excess Social Security surpluses over the next decade. Administration officials said the president's budget would not formally allocate the $500 billion for a particular purpose. But they said it and perhaps other money could be used to help establish private investment accounts within Social Security.
The two parties have agreed in recent years that this surplus should go only to debt reduction or to shoring up the retirement system's finances for the baby boom generation. Administration officials said they would not support using the $500 billion for tax cuts or new spending.
Mr. Bush's plan to create private investment accounts in Social Security has generated intense opposition from most Democrats, who have questioned where the president would find the money to establish the accounts while continuing to pay benefits to current retirees.
"They're talking about raiding the Social Security trust fund to fund privatization in part," said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee. "We say, 'No, no raid on the Social Security trust fund.' "
Gary Gensler, the Treasury Department official who oversaw the government debt markets during the Clinton administration, said the level of debt that could be paid off in the next decade was higher than Mr. Bush's team is suggesting.
He said no more than about $500 billion of the debt would be difficult to buy back, less than half of what the administration said was realistic. As a result, he said, the entire Social Security surplus could be used to retire debt over the next decade.

HEADLINE: Bush Selects An Economist From Columbia 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
After weeks of trying to fill the job of chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, President Bush yesterday nominated Robert Glenn Hubbard, a Columbia University economist and an outspoken advocate of tax cuts. 
 The council chairman was once the president's chief economic adviser. That role has shifted over the last decade directly to the White House, where Lawrence Lindsey has emerged as the chief adviser, as head of the National Economic Council. That council was created during the Clinton administration. 
 "I am Larry Lindsey's very good friend," said Mr. Hubbard, who has known Mr. Lindsey since their graduate school days at Harvard. "You have to see how these things evolve, but my hope for the Council of Economic Advisers is that it plays a very strong participatory role in developing economic policy."
Mr. Hubbard, who is 42, was a deputy assistant secretary in the Treasury Department in 1990 and 1991, during the administration of President Bush's father, and he joined the Bush campaign in 1999, helping to develop the president's economic policies.
Another member of President Bush's economics team, John B. Taylor of Stanford, was the front-runner to be chairman of the council, several economists said, but he declined the post rather than have his access to the White House controlled by Mr. Lindsey.
Mr. Taylor is now the front-runner to be named under secretary for international affairs at the Treasury Department, where his boss would be Paul H. O'Neill, the Treasury secretary. 
Mr. Hubbard, a prolific researcher, is professor of economics and finance at Columbia's Graduate School of Business. Tax law is a specialty. He has argued that high marginal tax rates discourage work effort and also entrepreneurial activity, which he says is mostly undertaken by the wealthy.
"We tend to think of the rich as getting rich by saving their money," Mr. Hubbard said in an interview yesterday. "But the rich get rich by taking risks, and you don't want tax policy that discourages risk taking" by taxing away the gains when the risk-taking pays off.
In other research, he has delved into the obstacles corporations encounter obtaining loans, even for potentially profitable investments, when their cash flow deteriorates. Similarly, he found, creditors become reluctant to lend to farmers, even successful farmers, when their farmland declines in value as land prices fall.
Family savings is another specialty. Mr. Hubbard's research has explored what makes people save or resist saving. 
"Glenn is a pragmatic conservative; he believes in markets, but he is not theological," said Kevin Hassett, a co-author with Mr. Hubbard on several projects and a senior fellow, as is Mr. Hubbard, at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research center in Washington.
Mr. Hubbard's work is known mainly among economists. But one study, published while he was a Treasury official, brought him considerable public attention. Income inequality had risen through the 1980's, while Republicans controlled the White House, and the growing disparity between rich and poor had become a political issue.
Many economists had accepted a finding that the richest 1 percent of Americans had reaped 70 percent of the growth in average family incomes from 1977 through 1988. Government data showed that the gap had widened alarmingly between low-income and high-income families. In his study, Mr. Hubbard countered that the data was misleading. The right approach, he said, was to measure income over a lifetime, not at a particular moment. From that vantage point, income inequality was less than it seemed, he said. People often moved from low incomes as young people to higher incomes in later years, Mr. Hubbard concluded.
His findings and his research were widely challenged, and Mr. Hubbard has given a bit of ground. "There is a great deal of income inequality," he acknowledged yesterday, "but there is also a great deal of mobility."
Born and raised in Florida, Mr. Hubbard earned an undergraduate degree in 1979 from the University of Central Florida and a doctorate from Harvard in 1983. He taught at Northwestern until 1988, when he shifted to Columbia. Since 1997, he has also held a joint appointment as an economics professor in Columbia's Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
"Hubbard is a first-class economist," said Martin Feldstein, a chairman himself of the Council of Economic Advisers, in the Reagan administration, and the thesis adviser at Harvard of both Mr. Hubbard and Mr. Lindsey. But being chairman of a council that once formulated policy and is now more focused on research no longer guarantees influence at the White House.
"What it will actually mean for Hubbard to be chairman will have to be worked out," Mr. Feldstein said. "As long as he is at all the top-level meetings, he can bring his personal views to the table and the analytic work of the council."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Arguments in the Appeal of the Antitrust Case 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
 Following are excerpts from oral arguments today in the Microsoft antitrust case before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House, a private transcription service. Representing Microsoft was Richard J. Urowsky; John G. Roberts Jr. presented arguments for the 19 state attorneys general who have sued Microsoft along with the Justice Department.

FOR MICROSOFT

MR. UROWSKY -- These are appeals from a final judgment finding Microsoft liable under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and ordering a breakup of the company as well as other extreme relief.
 Before turning directly to the government's monopoly maintenance claim, I'd like to make one point that lies at the heart of this case and cuts across all claims asserted in the complaints: Nothing Microsoft did foreclosed Netscape from any portion of the marketplace.
The district court found that Netscape distributed 160 million copies of Navigator in 1998 alone. This was sufficient to saturate the entire marketplace, which consisted of approximately 100 million Internet users at the time. The district court also found that between 1996 and 1998, the period at issue in this case, Netscape's installed base of users increased from 15 million to 33 million. In other words, millions of people chose to use Navigator despite the fact that Internet Explorer was included in every copy of Windows.
In fact, James Barksdale, Netscape C.E.O., testified that Netscape had between 40 and 70 million users at the time of trial, and internal Netscape documents from October of 1997, a year before the commencement of trial, estimate that Navigator's installed base was 65 million, up from 40 million the year before. That's an increase of 25 million users during the very period when the alleged restraints were supposed to be in effect.
This evidence shows that Netscape had unfettered access to consumers. Indeed, Microsoft's inclusion of Internet Explorer in Windows may have facilitated Nagivator's distribution by providing a convenient means of downloading the program from the Internet. The absence of any foreclosure from any part of the marketplace undermines every claim in this case.
I'd like to turn ----

JUDGE JUDITH W. ROGERS -- Foreclosure means more than simply impeding access?

MR. UROWSKY -- It means preventing access, typically in cases like this, by either locking up customers, which is not an issue in this case, or effectively foreclosing all channels of distribution. . . .

CHIEF JUSTICE HARRY T. EDWARDS -- Mr. Urowsky, let me take you back to some threshold questions and make sure that there's nothing the court's supposed to be agonizing over on your theory of the case, save what you've put in the brief. But some of what you're arguing here, I think we're going to assume, are your pressing points of greatest concern. Do you have anything that we need worry about a lot on your arguments with respect to market share or the definition of the relevant market?

MR. UROWSKY -- I think that our position is set out comprehensively in the briefs. Our position on market share is that market share, in and of itself, is not a significant element here. What's significant is whether the market share has been achieved effortlessly because of control of elements of supply or whether market share has been achieved as a result of relentless, unremitting and ferocious competition.

JUDGE EDWARDS -- All right. So that will take us to the conduct questions. What about definition of the relevant market, about which you say some things. Are there any things you think are important that we ought to know now?

MR. UROWSKY -- I think the position, again, is set forth in the brief, but in very summary form, there is a great and not benign contradiction underlying the government's case. On the one hand, the theory of liability is that the most significant forms of competition confronting the Windows operating system are nonoperating system software technologies.

JUDGE EDWARDS -- They're looking to victims in the middleware or alleged middleware market, and you're saying that's excluded from the definition of the relevant market ----

MR. UROWSKY -- Precisely.

JUDGE EDWARDS -- That is ironic, but so what? What do we do with it? Forgetting the causation questions, what do we do with it with respect to the definition of the relevant market, other than observe that it's ironic?

MR. UROWSKY -- I think that we need to take the next step and say that essentially the theory of liability impeaches the market definition. The purpose of defining a market is to identify the locus of effective competition.

JUDGE EDWARDS -- Well, let's assume that we changed the market definition and included the middleware or alleged middleware group, the prospective platform that we're arguing about, and we even included a Mac. What happens to your theory of the case? How does that change our analysis in any important way?

MR. UROWSKY -- I think what it then tells you is that the court cannot rely on a structural analysis to establish market power, because now we have no idea of what market shares any of these participants have, and because, in this case, there is an extraordinary heterogeneity to the participants who are competing to be successful software platforms. Being a successful software platform is a very desirable thing. That's why so many of these companies are investing so heavily in this area of technology.

JUDGE EDWARDS -- Well, let me be more pointed, to see whether we move on or there's something that I should worry about here. You make the claim that the definition of the relevant market is incorrect.

MR. UROWSKY -- Yes, Your Honor.

JUDGE EDWARDS -- Let's assume we agree with you, it is incorrect. If you were writing the opinion, you would say, and therefore, what?

MR. UROWSKY -- I would say and therefore the district court's determination as to monopoly power cannot stand, because there's no analysis of all of the elements that ought to be included in the market which are constraints on Microsoft's ----

JUDGE EDWARDS -- . . . in your argument as well, because while you want the Middleware included in the relevant market, you allow, as we all must, that it is only a hope, it is not an existing market at this point.

MR. UROWSKY -- And then, that brings us ----

MR. EDWARDS -- That isn't going to change the analysis very much. And if you add Mac in, you still have a share that's in the 80's.

MR. UROWSKY -- With great respect, Your Honor, I don't agree with that.

JUDGE EDWARDS -- Which?

MR. UROWSKY -- I don't agree with the part about the inclusion of other technologies in the marketplace not having an impact on the analysis.

JUDGE EDWARDS -- All right, well, then, tell me how?

MR. UROWSKY -- Because in this business, even a competitor who has not achieved mass market success -- and clearly whether some of these technologies have already achieved what borders on mass market success -- I'm thinking particularly at this point of Linux, certainly Apple and Java as well. But even without achieving mass market success, because of the economics of the business, they represent incredible threats. And the reason they -- incredible threats and, consequently, incredible restraints on behavior, on pricing behavior, on research and development, on the initiation of new products ----

JUDGE EDWARDS -- I think we could agree with you that they represent constraints, without saying that they are severe enough to refute the claim of market power.
Surely Microsoft does have a certain amount of freedom to choose its prices, right? I'm not sure that that makes it all that different from most other leading software makers in their particular field, but it does have that.

MR. UROWSKY -- There is no question that like almost every other supplier of a successful software product or any other intellectual property product, Microsoft has some market power and some -- some -- discretion in pricing, but that is not equivalent to monopoly power.

FOR THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL

MR. ROBERTS -- Your Honor, may it please the court, let's begin with the basic question of which test controls, the test articulated by the panel in the consent decree appeal or the test articulated by the Supreme Court in Jefferson Parish and Eastman Kodak.
The panel majority in Microsoft II, the consent decree appeal, stated no fewer than four times in its opinion, that it was construing a consent decree and not interpreting a statute. We think the court meant that. In footnote 14, the panel majority in Microsoft II said that the consent decree does not bar an action under the Sherman Act. We think the court meant that. The particular provision that the court was called upon to construe in Microsoft II referred to integrated products. It was, therefore, natural for the court to attempt to develop a test for integrated products. Under Jefferson Parish and Eastman Kodak that is not the pertinent question. The question is whether there is sufficient consumer demand so that it is efficient for a firm to offer the products separately.
The panel in Microsoft II, because it was construing a consent decree, was not bound by Jefferson Parish or Eastman Kodak. This court, today, confronting the question of the Sherman Act, is.
In addition, the panel in Microsoft II recognized that it was dealing with a very incomplete factual record. It was dealing with an improperly noticed preliminary injunction, and it specifically said that its conclusions were, quote, "subject to reconsideration on a more complete factual record." We now have that more complete factual record, and in a number of very particular respects, that factual record calls into question some of the assumptions that were made by the panel majority in Microsoft II. No fault of theirs; it was an incomplete factual record. I'll take one example to start with.
The panel in Microsoft II addressed the question of separating the browser, Internet Explorer, from the operating system, and said, "If you do that, really all you're doing is taking out four lines of code." That doesn't look like a separate product. It looks like a key to get into Internet Explorer.
Finding of Fact 185 explains that if you run the Felton program to remove browser functionality, it's not just four lines that are left behind. What is left is sufficient code that doesn't have to be loaded when you boot up Windows from the hard drive to the RAM to have Windows 98 take up 20 percent less RAM when it's booted up. So that may start to look like enough to be considered a separate product.
The court, in Microsoft II, focused on how Internet Explorer code was shared with operating system code.

JUDGE EDWARDS -- Mr. Roberts, can you reasonably argue that there is a separate market for browserless operating systems?

MR. ROBERTS -- Findings of Fact 149 to 154 ----

JUDGE EDWARDS -- I'm looking at them right now, and I've read them over and over again. And maybe I'm thinking too much about what I think I know, as opposed to focusing on the record, so I'm being honest with you, all right? It seems to me -- I won't say it's an absurd proposition -- it's a highly questionable proposition for anyone to now suggest that there is a separate market for a browserless operating system, in part because all operating systems include browsers and for lots of other reasons. It's a fairly absurd proposition.
So I was very curious to figure out what the district court opinion had to say about that. And I must say, as I traced what I think are a number of speculative observations about the district court, I can't find any underlying hard information to back up the inference. There's no clear finding. There's some speculation about inconvenience and employers don't like to have the Internet available to employees. There's no data that I can find.
Now, maybe it's there and you can point me to it.

MR. ROBERTS -- Well, there are two separate points, and I want to distinguish between them. The first is the precise question you asked: Is there a market for a browserless operating system?

JUDGE EDWARDS -- Right, and where's the data to support that?

MR. ROBERTS -- But the second point, which is related, and they follow sequentially in the findings, do consumers want to choose their operating systems separately from choosing their browser? And there was the testimony, for example, of the representative from Boeing, that they use different operating systems, they want a standard browser, so they don't want to buy them together; they want to choose them separately.
Now the district court did find that there's sufficient consumer demand for a browserless operating system, particularly referring, as Your Honor did, to companies that their employees have no business surfing the Web or they may, in some circumstances and not other circumstances, so they want some without a browser.

JUDGE STEPHEN F. WILLIAMS -- The makers of operating systems who were willing to remove the browser, did they offer any discount?

MR. ROBERTS -- I'm not aware of that, Your Honor. I do know ----

JUDGE WILLIAMS -- I think that inaudible contention on that has no rebuttal; that the government has done nothing to call my attention to any rebuttal material.

MR. ROBERTS -- First of all, those companies -- that constitutes every other company besides Windows.

JUDGE WILLIAMS -- That's right.

MR. ROBERTS -- Besides Microsoft. Microsoft was the only company that forced the tie.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT TO SEEK CUTS OF $2 TRILLION OF DEBT IN DECADE 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
In his address to Congress on Tuesday night and in the budget plan he will unveil on Wednesday, President Bush will seek to put the nation on a course to pay off $2 trillion of the national debt over the next 10 years, leaving $1.2 trillion of debt at the end of that period. 
 After several years of bipartisan consensus about the desirability of extinguishing as much debt as quickly as possible, with the goal of bringing it to zero in a decade or a little longer, Mr. Bush will say that bringing it below $1.2 trillion in that period, much less wiping it out entirely, will be all but impossible, White House officials said today. 
 The reasons are technical. But the political and economic repercussions could be substantial, affecting both this year's battle over tax cuts and spending and long-range problems like the dire financial outlook for Social Security. The president is also expected to announce the creation of a commission to make recommendations on how to deal with Social Security's long-term problems. 
The debt issue has been raised in recent months by economists including Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and by budget analysts at the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
But by highlighting it in his first budget, Mr. Bush is starting a new chapter in the debate over how the nation can best use the projected federal budget surplus, estimated at $5.6 trillion over the next decade.
Mr. Bush's budget plan will conclude that the national debt held by the public, which is projected to decline by the next fiscal year in October to just under $3.2 trillion, can be cut by $2 trillion over the subsequent decade, leaving $1.2 trillion in debt at the end of the 10-year period covered by the budget. The debt held by the public is currently $3.4 trillion.
White House officials said their position is not the result of a political or a policy decision, but a reflection of the fact that a portion of the debt in the form of a variety of bonds is not easily redeemable, either because it would be too expensive to do so or because its holders would be unwilling to part with it.
Debt reduction has proven extremely popular with voters, somewhat to the surprise of both parties. Democrats have made it a central element of their economic agenda and a first line of defense against calls by Mr. Bush and other Republicans for a big tax cut. In the presidential campaign, Mr. Bush's opponent, Al Gore, said he would seek to eliminate the debt by 2012.
Although the White House said today that it remains committed to reducing as much of the debt as possible, Republicans generally have been less convinced that debt reduction is any more potent an economic tool than tax cuts. And although economists tend to favor debt reduction as an efficient way of offsetting the nation's anemic savings rate, there is considerable debate among them about whether eliminating the debt should be the policy goal.
"The only debt that remains would be debt that it's not in the interest of the country or the taxpayers or the bondholders to have paid off," said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman.
Democrats said the administration was exaggerating the scale of the problem and undermining one of the pillars of economic progress in recent years. They called the approach a budgetary ploy by the White House to make more room for Mr. Bush's long list of campaign promises, from a $1.6 trillion tax cut to a new generation of weaponry for the Pentagon and private investment accounts for all workers.
"A remarkable consensus emerged at the end of President Clinton's second term to use the Medicare and Social Security surpluses to completely pay off our national debt," said Gene Sperling, who was Mr. Clinton's economic policy adviser and is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. "The new administration is seeking to up-end that consensus with a very questionable and misleading budget presentation to make their tax cut seem more responsible than it is."
White House officials said the $1.2 trillion in debt that cannot readily be extinguished includes a variety of government securities. Among them are savings bonds, bonds held by other nations, long-term bonds that do not mature until after 2011, and special bonds held by state and local governments. To buy back the nonredeemable debt would require paying more than the value of the bonds.
The administration's budget anticipates paying down $2 trillion in public debt that matures no later than 2011 out of the part of the projected surplus coming from Social Security -- about $2.5 trillion out of the total surplus of $5.6 trillion. The debt held by the public excludes $2.5 trillion the government owes to itself, largely in the form of promises to pay future Social Security benefits. 
"The maximum amount of debt the government could repurchase by 2011 without paying a premium is $2 trillion," said Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser. "To buy any of the additional debt would cost the taxpayer more than one dollar for every dollar of debt retired. We'd have to pay a penalty." 
The approach would leave $500 billion or so of excess Social Security surpluses over the next decade. Administration officials said the president's budget would not formally allocate the $500 billion for a particular purpose. But they said it and perhaps other money could be used to help establish private investment accounts within Social Security.
The two parties have agreed in recent years that this surplus should go only to debt reduction or to shoring up the retirement system's finances for the baby boom generation. Administration officials said they would not support using the $500 billion for tax cuts or new spending.
Mr. Bush's plan to create private investment accounts in Social Security has generated intense opposition from most Democrats, who have questioned where the president would find the money to establish the accounts while continuing to pay benefits to current retirees.
"They're talking about raiding the Social Security trust fund to fund privatization in part," said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee. "We say, 'No, no raid on the Social Security trust fund.' "
Gary Gensler, the Treasury Department official who oversaw the government debt markets during the Clinton administration, said the level of debt that could be paid off in the next decade was higher than Mr. Bush's team is suggesting.
He said no more than about $500 billion of the debt would be difficult to buy back, less than half of what the administration said was realistic. As a result, he said, the entire Social Security surplus could be used to retire debt over the next decade.

Frazier Assists Are With Words

BYLINE:  By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
THE high school principal, at 43, is old enough to recall when Walt Frazier was Clyde and Clyde epitomized cool.
 "I grew up in Far Rockaway," said Ronald J. Williams Wells. "I remember waiting hours at the mall across the Long Island border in Lawrence for Walt and Willis Reed. Walt had those long sideburns and flashy clothes. In those days, it wasn't the sound. It was the image." 
 At Martin Luther King High School in Manhattan yesterday, Frazier strode onto the stage in the school's auditorium in a plaid jacket and burgundy slacks, still a handsome man, albeit one with thinning hair and a highlight tape that to most teenagers might as well be from 1946.
He showed a film that characterized his championship Knicks of 1970 and 1973 but the kids cackled when they noticed the short shorts and players who broke ahead of the field and laid the ball in gently off glass. Frazier wasn't about to take it personally that in this place -- as a basketball player, at least -- he was just another representation of Black History Month. Heck, Michael Jordan has lost altitude as an icon, while Patrick Ewing, the Knicks' career leading scorer, was wondering Sunday in Boston what kind of reception he would get tonight, nine months removed from the Garden.
No. 10 in your souvenir program of retired Knick legends does not kid himself.
"Basketball was a great life," he said. "But after a while, especially with the kids, it's 'Walt Who?' " 
There was nothing in his closet that would impress the student body, but then, Walt Frazier has crafted a post-playing reputation that is not about image and all about sound, and why Principal Wells wanted Frazier and not some active jock to speak at his school. "As a person who loves language, he represented an athlete who transformed himself into a communicator," Wells said. "He values words, and if he's willing to share that, he helps my students."
Frazier came to the school on Amsterdam Avenue near Lincoln Center bearing gifts, namely his new softcover book, "Word Jam, an Electrifying, Mesmerizing, Gravity-Defying Guide to a Powerful and Awesome Vocabulary" (Troll). A protracted title, yes, but in line with the self-help strategy Frazier adopted several years ago when he began scouring theater and film reviews and even the dictionary after landing a job in the Knicks' radio booth.
He told the students that not long ago, he didn't know the words they would find in the book, and wasn't ashamed to admit it. Personal growth is in knowledge, he said, and he'd prefer words to be his legacy to that part of New York City unfamiliar with his wide-brim hats, and lightning-fast hands.
"When I started doing the words and rhymes on the radio, the kids would see me and say, 'Hey Clyde: ubiquitous,' " he said afterward. "They'd ask me to sign an autograph using one of my words. I could see how they related to me in a different way. It was funny -- I was getting bashed in the press for misusing the words once in a while but I would think, 'What is so bad about that when you're willing to try something different?' "
Go ask the president. Personally, I've enjoyed Frazier's work, his originality in an industry that makes celebrity millionaires out of loudmouths who yell, "Boom!" As Frazier said, he could have held the job for 20 years mouthing the cliches of a thousand others who don't express much opinion either.
Which reminds me: tonight's Garden guest of honor recently revealed his post-playing broadcasting plans, specifically mentioning the MSG network booth as a preferred starting point. Naturally, those of us accustomed to Ewing's economical thought-sharing over 15 years can only imagine what the critics will make of him.
I once asked Ewing if John Thompson had schooled him on being tight-lipped at Georgetown. He laughed and said: "Everyone thinks that. Coach Thompson used to encourage me to talk. It was me." Yes, it was Ewing who chose to give all he had on the court, and next to nothing off it. Of course, he will get his long and deserved ovation tonight, but there is also the issue of his enduring legacy, of what he will evoke when the kids ask: "Who's Patrick?"
There was a lasting void when Frazier left the Garden because he connected with the city, became part of its social fabric. In his time on radio and television, he's managed to reconfigure his niche, make himself relevant more than two decades after his last Knicks' shot, with his collection of words, his straight talk.
"Hey, what's the problem here, man?" he demanded when 16-year-old Triston Jones stood to engage him, and others in the assembly cracked up. "He's trying to articulate something. Show him some respect."
Principal Wells loved Frazier's unflappability with the students, and that he promised to return to find out which of them had made use of the book. Those who did, he said, could become part of Frazier's youth foundation, which locates and sponsors summer internships for teens.
"Most of them don't believe I'll be back," he said, autographing the kids' books. "When I do, if there's only one that I reached, that's cool."

To Trim Costs, 3Com Says It Will Eliminate 1,200 Jobs

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
The 3Com Corporation, the struggling maker of computer networking equipment, announced today that it would eliminate 1,200 jobs as part of an effort to restore the company to profitability.
 The cutback, which had been foreshadowed four days before Christmas, is part of an attempt to save more than $200 million in operating costs this year. 
 3Com, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it would lay off 900 salaried employees, or nearly 10 percent of its 9,200-member work force. The company will also let go 300 of its 2,500 contract and temporary workers. 
"In light of the U.S. economic downturn and turmoil in the telecommunications industry, I announced in December a global cost reduction initiative," Bruce Claflin, 3Com's chief executive, said in a statement. "3Com will focus all of its resources on work critical to market leadership and superior financial returns."
Brian Johnson, a 3Com spokesman, said across-the-board job cuts would affect workers in the United States, Asia and Europe. Many of those employees got word of their dismissals today.
3Com was among the first networking companies to warn of 2001 layoffs, but several other industry leaders swung the ax first. Within the last month, Nortel Networks and Lucent Technologies each outlined plans to eliminate as many as 10,000 jobs, nearly 10 percent of their work forces, through layoffs and attrition. Both companies cited declining sales and profits, complaints common to 3Com as well.
On Dec. 21, 3Com reported a net loss of $142.4 million for its fiscal second quarter, ended Dec. 1. Though the loss was slimmer than Wall Street's lowered estimates, the quarter was the third consecutive one to show a loss. 
At that time, Mr. Claflin said that 3Com intended to save $200 million to $250 million annually by curtailing travel expenses, property maintenance and the use of consultants. He projected then that the company would turn an operating profit in its first fiscal quarter, which ends in August.
Mr. Claflin said then that 3Com would take a one-time charge of $40 million to $60 million during the current quarter, which ends March 2, to accommodate the restructuring.
The mass layoffs are 3Com's second round in a year. In March 2000, the company announced plans to sell or close several of its slower-growing units, including its dial-up modem and high-end network businesses, and accelerated the spinoff of its Palm hand-held computer division. The move left 3Com a much smaller company, focused on broadband and wireless connectivity devices for consumers and small businesses.
By the end of the last quarter, employee numbers had fallen to 9,200 from 11,800. Today's announced cuts will reduce the work force to 8,300 full-time employees, Mr. Johnson said.
Workers will receive severance packages based on the length of their tenure, he said, and all will receive some help finding new jobs.
Michael Cristinziano, a senior vice president with Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company, said 3Com's layoffs should come as no surprise.
"The real question is: Are they cutting too thin or is it a sign of more to come?" asked Mr. Cristinziano, who has a 12-month target of $13 on 3Com shares and rates them outperform. "The swing factor will be the new products."
He was referring to 3Com's new Internet appliances, including the Audrey and Kerbango models, and its new services business, the CommWorks Corporation. 3Com created CommWorks, which builds networks for telephone companies and Internet service providers, in December.
"Until those really start to ramp," he said, "I don't expect the company will grow."
3Com shares gained 47 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $9.50.

HEADLINE: LIFE'S WORK; 
Putting Younger Workers to Shame

BYLINE:  By LISA BELKIN; This column about the intersection of jobs and personal lives appears every other week. E-mail: Belkin@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HUBERT GREEN -- he'd like you to call him Hubie -- is 84 years old and has been an air-conditioning engineer since the end of World War II. That is longer than he ever thought he would work. It's certainly longer than anyone around him has worked, and although he has fleeting thoughts of retirement, he does not know how to make a decision that final.
 "I would never want to work where I'm not wanted," he said. "I guess I'll just get the message when it's time to go." 
 We stumble into the workplace through a mixture of instinct, planning, happenstance and gravitational pull. Then, decades later, we stumble out the same way. Work takes on a different meaning as it nears its likely end. There are those who can't wait to retire. But there are also those who are dismayed to find they can't afford to, and some, like Hubie Green, who wonder who they will be if they do.
"The brain, if you don't use it, goes to sleep," says Gil Weatherly, a 92-year-old businessman from Mountain View, Calif. He arrives at his office at 8 a.m. every weekday.
"I have friends who retired, they had very top positions, and now they don't even know me anymore," he said.
Mr. Green learned his trade in the Army, back when air-conditioners were run on sulfur dioxide, not Freon. He is what's known as an estimator, the math whiz who calculates how to cool large commercial buildings most efficiently. "It's a lot like playing bridge," he said. "You have to use your wits to figure out the best way, the most economical way." He does this today much as he always has, with a slide rule, plain and simple. "My slide rule can do things a computer can't," he said. 
He tried to hang up that slide rule once, at 67, when his boss brought in two sons to learn the trade. A few months later he was back, because "I couldn't stand the nothing days." Then, at the end of last year, the same boss hired a "young fellow" as a second estimator, and Mr. Green tried to quit again. But within a month, the new man was gone and now Mr. Green "has even more work than I had before."
He wants it made clear that he is not a wind-up machine, and that time has taken its toll. He has cut back to a three-day workweek (well, at the moment it's four, but only because he's helping to run the place while his boss is on a cruise). He has also stopped climbing on roofs at project sites, leaving others to report back what they see.
And he hopes he does not sound like an old fogey when says that "my younger compatriots" don't seem to understand what real work is. "I'm disappointed in the younger people," he said. "I've seen young people out of college multiply 50 by 10 and they need a piece of paper, can't do anything in their head."
They also aren't made of his sterner stuff. "They take sick days," he said. "I never take them. I'd feel just as bad staying home as going to work, so I might as well get some work done."
Jordan Lazzari, 77, has watched the work ethic change, too. He has been an insurance claims adjuster since 1950, until he retired in 1986. Bored, he took on a two-week temporary assignment with an insurance company and then stayed for more than 10 years. His grudging concession to age was that he would only work 7 a.m. to noon. But, says Wayne Nolan, the man who recruited him in the first place, "he does more in those five hours than most other people do all day."
Mr. Lazzari and Mr. Green remind me of younger versions of my firecracker of a great-aunt, who celebrated her 100th birthday just last week. Minnie Horowitz kept the books for a series of businesses for many decades, then she retired. While in her 80's she ran into a casting director during a morning at the Laundromat and next thing she knew she was an actress in national TV commercials, making a nice second living. "I never wanted to stop," she said. "Working was more fun than not working."
But Aunt Minnie did stop, because the days became too tiring and she couldn't trust her brain to hold on to her lines. Mr. Lazzari is about to stop, too. He tumbled down a flight of steps several months ago, breaking more bones than he can count.
"I think I've had it," he said. "All I've known is claims, but my bones ache. I think I'm going to pack it in."
Mr. Green realizes he will make his decision the same way. In other words, he will never choose to leave; he will let time decide for him. "Luckily for me, the firm is expanding," he said. "There's plenty for me to do."

HEADLINE: WINE TALK; 
Burgundy's Big Guys Aren't the Bad Guys

BYLINE:  By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
YEARS ago, when I made my first tentative -- and largely unsuccessful -- efforts to understand Burgundy, I did learn one thing. There seemed to be an unbridgeable gulf between the small growers in the villages and the powerful negociants, or shippers, and nothing would ever bring them together.
 Negociants are the merchants who buy grapes, make wine, age and bottle it and sell it all over the world. Some of them, or at least the names, are familiar to anyone who knows even a little about Burgundy: Louis Latour, Joseph Drouhin, Joseph Faiveley, Louis Jadot, Bouchard Pere & Fils, Albert Bichot, Leroy. The negociants make a variety of wines, some with grapes from their own vineyards, others from grapes grown in the many small towns that make up the Burgundy region like Pommard, Fixin, Meursault, Volnay and Gevrey-Chambertin. 
 Burgundy had serious economic difficulties in the years before World War II, and most of the small growers -- peasant farmers, really -- felt abused by the negociants in Beaune and Nuits-St.-Georges, the main Burgundian towns. So, too, did the customers of the negociants from England, the United States, Continental Europe and the rest of France.
Aside from controlling the market, the negociants were often accused of making mediocre wine, of regularly and illegally blending in heavier wines from Rhone and even Algeria. The growers believed they could do better on their own.
"Whole trainloads of wine from the south would roll into Beaune around harvest time," Jacques d'Angerville, one of the great Volnay winemakers, once told me. "The locals would say they 'baptized' the stuff to make it Burgundy." 
Mr. d'Angerville's father was one of the few to protest. By the late 1930's, some buyers, including Raymond Baudouin from Paris, the founder of the influential Revue du Vin de France, encouraged the growers to break away from the negociants and to make and sell their own wines. Mr. Baudouin urged Frank Schoonmaker, an American writer turned wine importer, to buy directly from the growers and later encouraged Alexis Lichine, Col. Frederick Wildman and Robert Haas, other American buyers, to do the same. 
Soon, the best of the Burgundian growers, or domaines, were as well known as the top negociants. From Marsannay in the north of the Cote d'Or, as the most famous part of Burgundy is known, to Santenay in the south, the growers became stars, like small estates more recently in California. Among the best Burgundy domains, then and now, are Lafon, Trapet, Roumier, de Vogue, Grivot, Ramonet, Gouges, Senard, Remoissenet, d'Angerville, Roulot and Leflaive. It was a profound but successful change in the Burgundy market, and by the 1960's, experts said that the days of the negociants, the much-reviled middlemen, were over. 
The experts were wrong. The negociants, after all, owned some of the best vineyards in Burgundy. Drouhin owned most of the famous Clos des Mouches vineyard in Beaune. Jadot owned the equally great Clos des Ursules vineyard, also in Beaune. Louis Latour owned a large part of Corton-Charlemagne, and Joseph Faiveley, in addition to a parcel in the Corton-Charlemagne vineyard, owned pieces of famous vineyards all over Burgundy. What's more, these and other negociants had long made good wines. 
Slowly, even as the estate-bottling trend expanded in Burgundy, the negociants modernized. Steadily, if not quite stealthily, they expanded their holdings until some, like Faiveley, make more than 80 percent of their wines from their own grapes. Jadot, owned by Americans, has expanded into Beaujolais, and Faiveley is known almost as well for Mercurey, Clos des Myglands, as for Cote d'Or wines. Mercurey is in the Cote Chalonnaise, south of the Cote d'Or.
For consumers, Burgundy still has problems. Overcropping, or planting too much in a vineyard, unfortunately a natural reaction to intense worldwide demand, still leads to thin, characterless wines. Prices for the best names meanwhile are unconscionably high. But with the negociants and the estates more or less competing, and with some of the best winemakers working for the negociants, it can no longer be said that estate-bottled Burgundies are always better than negociant wines.
Newcomers to the region have added new life. AXA, the giant French insurance company, owns the Domaine l'Arlot near Nuits-St.-Georges, and Joseph Henriot, who made his name in Champagne, bought the underperforming negociant house of Bouchard Pere & Fils and has vowed to make it a star. 
In the face of withering criticism in the 1980's and early 90's, more producers have reduced yields to make more concentrated wines. Others have converted at least partly to biodynamic farming, producing disease-resistant vines and rejuvenating the overworked Burgundian soil. 
Quality improvements in Burgundy have been spurred by the remarkable success of Burgundian-style wines made elsewhere. All red Burgundy is made from pinot noir grapes. It was once assumed that no one could compete with Burgundy's pinot noir. No longer, with excellent pinot noir coming from California, Oregon, South Africa and New Zealand. In fact, a couple of cheeky New Zealanders have gone so far as to open a shop in the center of Beaune, the unofficial capital of Burgundy, where they sell only New Zealand wines. If Oregonians ever decide to do the same, the Burgundians will know they have their work cut out for them.

Clashing Arias for Berlin Opera

BYLINE:  By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
Rome, Amsterdam, Madrid and Washington have one opera house each, while New York, London, Vienna and Paris can boast two. Berlin, on the other hand, has three, which is a dream for operagoers but increasingly a nightmare for those charged with keeping them afloat. Put simply, Berliners love having three opera houses that they cannot afford. Who, then, is going to foot the bill?
 That question, of singular importance to the opera world and to Berlin's culture officials, is also the stuff of fierce argument and bitter recriminations in the Berlin press. Indeed, such is the passion of opera politics here that a banal battle over spending priorities has awakened residual East-West tensions and exposed simmering German distrust of Berlin as the capital of a united Germany. 
 Simple solutions soon look complicated. Increase ticket prices? Poorer East Berliners would be hurt. Close one opera house? The city's cultural image would be damaged. Seek corporate backing? Private sponsors are suspected of ulterior motives. Beg for more federal government support? Many Germans, mindful of history, object to having their tax money used to turn Berlin into a powerful capital anew. 
Things were easier when Berlin was an occupied and divided city. On both sides of the wall, culture was considered propaganda worthy of generous subsidies. West Germany cheerfully financed the Deutsche Oper, a bunkerlike theater built in 1961, while East Germany looked after the Staatsoper Unter den Linden, founded in 1742 by the Prussian monarchy, as well as the Komische Oper, which was created in 1947 and performs only in German.
But after East Germany disappeared in 1990, a united Berlin suddenly found itself running 3 opera houses along with 8 orchestras and 17 theaters, all accustomed to living off government handouts. These were fine assets for a city with ambitions to become the cultural hub of Central Europe, but they proved weighty burdens when the city lost the financial privileges of being the cold war capital.
In the initial excitement of unification, the federal government in Bonn promised Berlin $500 million a year for 10 years to subsidize its cultural institutions. But after providing just $105 million a year for three years, it cut off the subsidies entirely, forcing the closing of the Schiller Theater in the former West Berlin. Then in 1996 the government restored the annual grant to $30 million and increased it to $50 million after the capital moved from Bonn to Berlin in 1999.
But this was not enough. For all the money that has gone into rebuilding Berlin in the last decade, it remains a poor city by German standards, one largely without industry or a strong tax base. It is poorer than any large city in the former West Germany, too poor to spend heavily on culture. Yet, under Germany's federal system, even as Berlin struggles to make unification real, it is expected to be largely autonomous.
"In 1995, I said to Eberhard Diepgen, the mayor, you have to set priorities," recalled Daniel Barenboim, the Israeli conductor who in 1992 took over the Staatsoper and its orchestra, the Staatskapelle, as music and artistic director. "And in opera, you have to decide for one of the big opera houses. If you decide it is the Deutsche Oper, I may be sad and go, but I would understand. It would be better than gradually reducing the budget."
Such a tough call was never made. The three opera houses were urged to cut employees and seek other ways to saving money, but their annual subsidies, which account for over 80 percent of their income, were effectively frozen -- at $42 million for the Staatsoper, $40 million for the Deutsche Oper and $30 million for the Komische Oper -- with no adjustments for inflation and the annual wage increases required by law.
"The opera houses were earning less and less and were running up deficits," said Christoph Stolzl, who heads Berlin's culture department. "The projection was that they'd go broke. At the end of each year they would ask for extra money from the city Parliament, which would grind its teeth and pay the deficit. Last March the Parliament said opera houses with deficits had to be managed by us. It also asked for a plan to save the opera houses over the long run."
Mr. Stolzl started from the premise that the opera houses could not operate independently of one other, each with its own orchestra, chorus, soloists and ballet corps as well as technicians and workshops. An idiosyncrasy of opera in Berlin is that different opera houses frequently schedule the same opera, not only in the same season but also in the same week and sometimes the same night, and Mr. Stolzl considered this impractical, too.
His plan, vaguely inspired by the Paris National Opera, which runs the Palais Garnier and the Bastille Opera, was to merge the Staatsoper and the Deutsche Oper under one management. The smaller Staatsoper would present pre-19th century opera from, say, Monteverdi to Mozart, leaving the Romantic repertory of, say, Verdi and Wagner to the Deutsche Oper. Mr. Stolzl also imagined eliminating 77 positions from the newly united orchestra. The Komische Oper would not be affected.
Opposition was immediate, with Mr. Barenboim even threatening to resign. "It was a Machiavellian plan cooked up by the West Berliners who still run the city," he said. "They proposed closing the Staatsoper for four years for renovation, then reopening in 2006 with a smaller orchestra. They would have killed the Staatskapelle."
The offstage drama escalated. With Mr. Barenboim organizing a Save the Staatsoper petition signed by opera luminaries around the world, the Deutsche Oper's incoming general director, Udo Zimmermann, was squabbling with the music director, Christian Thielemann. A local Christian Democrat politician made things worse. "On the one hand, you have the young von Karajan in Thielemann," said the politician, Klaus Landowsky. "On the other, you have the Jew Barenboim."
Mr. Barenboim was outraged, waving away Mr. Landowsky's claim that he was being complimentary and had meant to underscore the cultural diversity of the new Berlin. "If you must speak about me, leave my Jewishness out of it," the conductor said. Federal and city officials were in turn terrified that Mr. Barenboim might blame anti-Semitism for his departure from Berlin. Last November, in an undisguised move to appease him, the federal government gave the Staatsoper a $1.75 million subsidy to bring the musicians' wages at the Staatskapelle up to par with those at the Deutsche Oper. The other opera houses viewed this as favoritism.
Finally, later that November, after the German Opera Directors' Conference opposed the merger plan, it was dropped. Triumphant, Mr. Barenboim abandoned talk of resigning and began negotiating renewal of his contract, which expires in 2002, although now as only music director, without the administrative duties of artistic director. An armistice was also declared at the Deutsche Oper where Mr. Zimmermann agreed to renew Mr. Thielemann's contract.
Today, however, Mr. Stolzl still faces the question: who will foot the bill? Radical action, he has concluded, is not politically viable. "If you close an institution in the east, they say the colonists of the west want to smother our culture," he said. "And if you close something in West Berlin, they complain that it's the west paying for unification."
Experience shows that a sharp increase in ticket prices, which range from $10 to $70, is also not realistic. "Attendance is good because ticket prices are cheap," Mr. Stolzl said. 
And more federal aid is unlikely. Julian Nida-Rumelin, Germany's new culture minister, who recently moved here from Munich, said that there was no support elsewhere in Germany for making Berlin the nation's cultural capital. "Can Berlin afford three opera houses of this size?" he asked. "For me, this is a problem for the city to resolve, not the federal government."
And yet, thanks also to the Berlin Philharmonic, music is the one area where Berlin can outshine cities like Frankfurt, Munich and Hamburg. Along with museums, music is perhaps Berlin's principal tourist attraction. On one recent long weekend, opera lovers had the choice of "Otello," "Aida" and "Elektra" at the Staatsoper; "Don Carlo" and "Elektra" at the Komische Oper; and "Madama Butterfly" and "Tosca" at the Deutsche Oper.
But can this continue? Andre Schmitz, the acting general director at the Deutsche Oper, said the theater offered 257 performances in 2000, 60 fewer than in 1994. And despite cutting employees to 740 from 1,100 and modestly raising ticket prices, he said, the Deutsche Oper had a $3 million deficit because of annual wage increases.
Still, there are signs of progress in one area. To commemorate the centennial anniversary of Verdi's death this year, the three opera houses organized a mini-festival in which they avoided duplication and offered 35 evenings of Verdi in January and February. In the future, Mr. Stolzl said, the city will insist on coordination of repertory at the opera houses. "If there is no agreement, their money will be blocked," he added.
New players in the opera arena may prove more flexible than their predecessors. Next year the Staatsoper will have a new artistic director working with Mr. Barenboim. Mr. Zimmermann, who officially takes over at the Deutsche Oper in August, has announced plans to increase new opera productions each season to six from four. The Komische Oper has in turn named a respected opera director, Andreas Homoki, as its artistic director beginning in 2002, when he will succeed Harry Kupfer, who has held the post since 1981.
"I'm eager to find young singers who will have great careers but whom we can still afford," Mr. Homoki said. "I want to introduce more outside directors so that the Komische Oper isn't stuck with the style of one director. I'm also ready to consider not using the German language in some cases. Most of all, I think the three houses in Berlin should offer more choice. I think we should do more operetta. We're the house for operetta."
But Mr. Stolzl said he believed the best solution in the next year or so would be to turn the opera houses into government-owned private companies run by an independent board of trustees. One result might be to depoliticize the opera crisis. Another would be to encourage the houses to increase their budgets through corporate sponsorships, a revenue source largely untapped here.
Mr. Barenboim said that at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, where he is also music director, 80 people worked in the marketing department. "Here we have no marketing department," he said. "We have to professionalize fund-raising." 
Mr. Schmitz said that the Deutsche Oper's budget comprised $40 million from the city, $6 million from tickets and less than $1 million from other sources. "The problem," he noted, "is that even the rich are poor here."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 8, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An Arts Abroad article on Feb. 28 about the problems of financing Berlin's three opera houses gave an erroneous number from the conductor Daniel Barenboim for the marketing department of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. The organization says 12 people are on its marketing staff -- in contrast to the Staatskapelle, which has none -- and that people in related Chicago areas like communications bring the total to 40, not 80.

HEADLINE: EN ROUTE: HAWAII; 
From the Volcano, The Rarest Brew

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: CAPTAIN COOK, Hawaii 

 BODY:
AS you drive south along the west coast of the Big Island, you can't help smelling the coffee roasting. With that, and the slopes of Mauna Loa on your left, bathed in the sumptuous sunlight of a Hawaiian morning, and the whales cavorting in the blue Pacific on your right, who needs roses?
 You are smelling the pride of the Kona coast, the best coffee produced in the United States. It comes from trees growing in the slowly decomposing lava flows that stripe the hillside along a milewide, 25-mile-long piece of land stretching from Holualoa south to Honaunau. One of the most prominent growers in Captain Cook, John Langenstein, calls these 2,500 precious acres "God's gift to the coffee bean." 
 Coffee is grown on most of the Hawaiian Islands, but Kona's well-drained basaltic soil is perfect. The climate pattern is perfect, with sunlight in the morning, which is beneficial, and cloud cover in the afternoon, a natural canopy that blocks out the day's most intense heat, which is not. And the rainfall is perfect -- 60 to 90 inches a year at 1,100 feet, compared with 2 inches on the beaches only a mile away. 
Whether brewed in a drip pot or in an espresso machine, pure Kona produces a cup of coffee with a creamy head and a magnificently full body. Its taste is winy and multidimensional, with enough acidity to give it balance. The first time I tasted it, almost a decade ago, I knew it was something special, and I'm no kind of coffee connoisseur. My choosy wife, Betsey, agreed. 
At a retail price of $20 a pound or more, growers here concede, Kona is one of the world's costliest coffees. Yet no one is getting rich; Mr. Langenstein estimates that he cleared about $20,000 last year. His mill, a ramshackle apparatus made of plywood and galvanized steel, with handmade pulleys and belts, is 100 years old. He sticks at it, he said, because he loves the climate, having grown up in Newark, N.Y., near Rochester, where winters can be brutal, and because "it's such a great place to raise kids."
Mike Craig, another grower, summed it all up in four pithy words: "Life's great, work stinks."
For the dozens of small growers, economies of scale and hip marketing campaigns are beyond reach. So most sell mostly on the Internet. The only producer of pure Kona who seemed to be making it big turned out to be a fraud. Officials of Kona Kai coffee were convicted in 1996 in a $20 million swindle in which cheaper Central American green (unroasted) coffees were put into bags marked "Kona." Not all French bread comes from France, one of the miscreants argued; "why should all Kona coffee come from Kona?"
There is, in fact, no need to flout the law. A perfectly legal way to make money on Kona coffee is to blend it with less expensive coffees and sell the result as Kona.
That's what big roasters do. They benefit from the name while bypassing most of the cost that goes along with using only carefully hand-tended, handpicked beans from the Kona coast. They must label their stuff "Kona blend," and the purists can call theirs "100 percent Kona," but the word "blend" somehow ends up in smaller type.
A University of Hawaii study a couple of years ago estimated that 20 million pounds of Kona coffee are sold annually, although only about 2 million pounds of Kona beans are produced. Legally, a blend containing 10 percent Kona can be called Kona coffee.
"We have a terrible marketing problem," said Merle Wood, a big-time corporate lawyer turned small-time coffee grower. He said it with the air of a man who has spent a lot of time trying to roll boulders up Mauna Kea. Well he might. As the president of the Kona Coffee Council, an alliance of small growers, he and several colleagues, led by Mr. Langenstein and Mr. Craig, have struggled in vain to establish a certification mark for coffee grown in the Kona district.
Such trademark protection exists for Maui and Vidalia onions and for Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee, as well as for many wine regions, but the growers' efforts have been blocked by the big coffee companies.
"Our market is on the mainland," Mr. Wood said. "Starbucks has taught people there about good coffee, but it's a very long way away, and convincing them to insist on pure Kona is a very difficult proposition. This is a poor island, where nobody but the tourists can pay or will pay 20 bucks a pound for coffee. But what tourists take home, if they take food at all, is chocolate-covered macadamia nuts." 
Coffee trees (Coffea arabica, mostly of Guatemalan origin) grow to 20 feet tall in Kona, and they sometimes live for a century or more, developing trunks up to six inches thick. As is often the case with grapevines, the old trees yield the best fruit.
Actually, the trees look more like bushes, with heavily ridged leaves and long whiplike branches that bend toward the ground when heavy with fruit. Members of the gardenia family, they produce amazingly fragrant, brilliantly white flowers that coat the hills 8 or 10 times a year, usually beginning in December or January. "Hawaiian snow," the locals call it.
The fruit that follows is a berry about the size of a cherry tomato, which gradually turns from green to scarlet as it ripens. But this is not an accommodating fruit like the apple or the peach. With so many flowerings a year and a ripening period of seven to nine months, there can be no single harvest.
So the pickers, mostly Mexicans, have to make their laborious way down the rows of trees as many as a dozen times a year, steadying themselves on the steeply sloping mountainside as they pluck the ripe berries from the trees. They squeeze the berries, and out pop the seeds -- fresh coffee beans, coated in a sweet mucilage-like substance. Usually, there are two; when there is only one, it is called a peaberry. (Some growers argue that peaberries make a superior cup of java, but others dismiss that as hype).
At this stage the coffee is known as "cherry," and a lot of arduous processing lies ahead before it is ready for the roaster, let alone the grinder, the pot and the cup. The foamy covering is removed in a pulping mill. Then the beans ferment overnight before drying, either in a gas oven or, preferably, on what the early Japanese farmers here called a hoshidana, or drying deck. This is a series of concrete pads with retractable corrugated steel roofs that can be left open to the sun and closed when it rains. The beans are raked repeatedly during daylight hours to keep them from spoiling.
When the moisture content is reduced to 11 or 12 percent, the beans develop a papery covering called "parchment." At this stage they can be stored for fairly extended periods.
Many small operators among the 600 growers here, lacking the capital to install expensive machinery, are forced to sell their cherry to the big processors for whatever price they can get, which in bad times is not much, rather than waiting for the market price to rise. Others pay a fee to have the raw beans processed for them.
The final stages involve grinding off the husklike covering, grading the beans (Extra Fancy, Fancy, No. 1, Prime) and, of course, roasting.
Mr. Langenstein, who produces 8,000 pounds of coffee on his 8.3 acres in a good year, ages some of his beans for as much as 12 months in parchment. A onetime wine-and-food man at Hawaiian hotels, he thinks this mellows the coffee and brings out subtleties in its flavor, the same way that storage in oak barrels helps mature wine. 
Coffee growers, fierce individualists all, disagree about almost everything. Is gas-drying or air-drying better? Should roasted beans be kept at room temperature, in the refrigerator or in the freezer? And perhaps the most contentious question of all: light roast or dark? Mr. Langenstein thinks dark-roasting caramelizes the coffee too much, thus increasing the caffeine concentration and making it harder to taste the nuances in the brew. Mr. Craig, just a few miles up the road, thinks lighter roasts taste wimpy.
Choose your poison.
A missionary named Samuel Ruggles brought the first coffee trees to this island in 1828 -- for their ornamental value, not to produce a cash crop. But by 1845, the first exports were on their way to California, and starting about a hundred years ago, Japanese farmers came to dominate the growing of coffee in Kona. Some came directly from Japan, but many escaped from slavelike conditions on Hawaiian sugar plantations before their contracts expired, rode here on donkeys along narrow cliffs and changed their names.
Living frugally in tiny frame houses, often without electricity or running water, the farmers were constantly in hock to the stores owned by the big mills. In an exhibition at the Kona Historical Society, a farmer named Yosoto Egami recalled, "The store advanced merchandise for your family . . . and at the end of the year, in return, you had to give your crop to the store."
Restricted by geography to the small zone near Mauna Loa, the Kona coffee industry, and indeed the coffee industry in the islands as a whole, never approached the size of the giant Brazilian, Costa Rican and African plantations. It was plagued by economic collapse in its main markets, the United States and Japan, and later by price volatility. One old-timer recalled the price of cherry falling to 33 cents a pound, from $1.37, in two or three weeks.
Most remaining Japanese-American growers are getting old, and some, like the mother of Eddie Sakamoto, the nonpareil wine waiter at the Canoe House hotel, grow coffee only part time now. They sell their output to the Kona Pacific Farmers Co-Op, which processed about 1.5 million pounds of cherry (from about 300 farmers) last year.
Recently, the historical society acquired and restored the former D. Uchida farm, established in 1913, as the Kona Coffee Living History Farm, which still produces coffee the old-fashioned way. Think you know something about frugality? Then check this: ceiling panels sewn from cotton rice sacks. (Small groups are given tours, by advance reservation only, by costumed guides. Detailed information on the World Wide Web at www.konahistorical.org.)
It was the arrival in the 1980's and 1990's of retirees and others from the mainland, known here as haoles, that transformed coffee-growing. Striving for maximum quality, more than 40 of them now market their own estate coffees -- those grown on a single farm that is owned or leased by the farmer, with careful records kept to establish its origin. Five of these estates have been grouped together for greater marketing efficiency as Pele Plantations (www .peleplantations.com), but most have stubbornly gone it alone.
The new growers are a varied bunch, to put it mildly. One of them, Gus Brocksen, who heads Pele Plantations, hands out business cards identifying himself as "Head Bean." Another, Mischa Sperka, is a voluble former museum curator of Central European origin who farms 10 acres and processes his own coffee and that of 25 neighbors. Nikki Ferrari, who runs a sizable non-estate mail-order business under the name Hawaiian Mountain Gold, says he is a distant relative of the Italian automaking family.
And then there is Mike Craig. I found him at the end of a steep, stony, rutted, twisting road, well up the mountain, where he lives with his family in a kind of treehouse, with its sides open to the breezes, surrounded by towering Norfolk pines and orange-flowering African tulip trees. A burly, bushy-haired man who used to teach and coach at a high school in San Diego, he came here after watching a Pacific Southwest Airlines jet crash there in 1978.
"It was an omen," he said. "When planes start falling on your house, it's time to try something new."
Eight years later, he became the first all-organic producer of Kona Coffee, substituting weed-whacking for herbicides and compost for chemical fertilizer, and enriching the soil further with glacial rock dust. He found in short order that his product, now sold under the Rooster Farms label (www.roosterfarms.com), could command a premium price, he said, "just as it ought to." He charges $25.95 a pound, with shipping extra.
"It's twice as much work," Mr. Craig's wife, Lindy, added, "but it's not near twice as much money."
Like the others, they depend heavily for sales on the Internet, word of mouth and a mailing list built up over the years. Like the others, they do most of the work themselves, and do it well enough that they have a contract to supply coffee to Merriman's, the Big Island's top restaurant.
Mr. Langenstein weighs each bag of coffee he sells on a tiny Directo postage scale, seals it with a gadget that looks like a curling iron and signs it by hand, "so people know what they get." His coffee, labeled Langenstein Farms, sells for $25, shipping included (www.kona-coffee .com).
But the big guys may be coming. A few days before Christmas, a 1,570-acre ranch on the Kona coast, once owned by the actor Jimmy Stewart, was sold to a local investor for $7.4 million. The investor, Guy Cobb, said he planned to replace the pastures, forests and macadamia groves that now cover the land with coffee trees.

HEADLINE: Beijing, Turning Tables, Defends Its Repression of Sect 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
The Chinese government lashed out today in frustration against critics of its harsh crackdown on the Falun Gong spiritual movement, making strenuous new efforts to paint the group as evil and murderous, and accusing the United States and other critics of harboring "ulterior motives."
 The government also responded angrily to the State Department report on Monday that condemned China's rights record in 2000, and issued its own counterreport, "U.S. Human Rights Record in 2000." It detailed, for example, the large number of deaths by gunfire, the role of big money in election campaigns and the growth in the American prison population. 
 China is trying to polish its human rights image in part to aid its bid to play host to the 2008 Olympics. 
Today the United Nations commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson, who is visiting Beijing, said officials had indicated that China might ratify the United Nations Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as early as Wednesday. But it was not clear, she said, whether China would fully accept the most sensitive clause, on free labor unions.
In a meeting with Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, Ms. Robinson made a special plea on grounds of compassion for the release of a prominent democracy advocate, Xu Wenli, who was sentenced in 1998 to 13 years in prison and is said to be ill with hepatitis. She said Mr. Tang had promised to "look into it."
At a news conference specially called today by the State Council, China's cabinet, the head of a new anticult office likened the outlawed Falun Gong to an "illegal drug addiction," with similar deadly risks to practitioners and society. 
"Tens of thousands of families have been destroyed" by the practice of Falun Gong, said the official, Liu Jing, chief of the office for the prevention and handling of cults. The office was established last fall as demonstrations by unrepentant members continued unabated.
Falun Gong, started in 1992 by Li Hongzhi, a former low-level official now living in the United States, attracted millions of Chinese with its blend of traditional meditative techniques and promises of spiritual salvation and physical well-being. It was outlawed in July 1999 after the group staged an audacious demonstration outside the leadership compound in Beijing to demand official recognition.
The widely reported harassment, arrests and beatings of Falun Gong followers have attracted growing international censure, a source of great frustration to Chinese officials, who say that other countries have also taken decisive, even violent actions to control "evil cults" and that the critics apply a double standard.
In meetings with senior officials here over the last two days and in a briefing for reporters, Ms. Robinson described her deep concern over the manner in which the crackdown on Falun Gong has been conducted.
"I emphasized that it's important to bear in mind at all times that individual Falun Gong members have human rights that must be respected," she said. 
"It is very clear that the rights of individual members are being violated," she told reporters after an international meeting on China's system of "re-education through labor." That system, under which police authorities can send people accused of minor crimes to labor camps for up to three years with no judicial oversight, has reportedly been used to detain thousands of Falun Gong believers.
Ms. Robinson said she told China's justice minister that if China is to comply with internationally accepted standards of civil rights, as it says it intends to, then the labor re-education system must be abolished.
"There is no due process," she said at the briefing. "The system is inherently arbitrary."
She said the minister, Zhang Fusen, defended the system -- which is often used to jail drug users, prostitutes and petty criminals as well as political and religious dissidents -- as an important tool for rehabilitating people. But he did say it was open to improvement, Ms. Robinson said. Parliament is currently discussing how to revise the law governing labor re-education.
Mr. Liu, the head of the anticult office, would neither confirm nor deny estimates by rights monitors that 5,000 or more Falun Gong adherents had been taken to labor re-education camps. But he painted a radically different picture of those prison farms than is usually given by former inmates.
"The legitimate rights of people receiving re-education through labor are fully guaranteed by law," he said. The camps are governed by principles of "education, persuasion and redemption," he added, and inmates are treated "like teachers treat students, like doctors treat patients, like parents treat their children."
Mr. Liu also would not comment directly on reports that more than 100 Falun Gong members have died in police custody, instead changing the subject to what he called the high toll the "evil cult" had exacted.
By government estimates, more than 136 practitioners had committed suicide -- seeking a path to heaven "at the instigation of Li Hongzhi's heresies," Mr. Liu said -- even before the group was outlawed in July 1999. At least 103 more have killed themselves since then, he said, including a woman who died in a group self-immolation last month in Tiananmen Square.
Counting those who have died because they refused to seek medical care, believing Falun Gong's mystical powers would cure them, the movement has caused 1,660 deaths, Mr. Liu asserted.
Falun Gong leaders insist that the founder and spiritual master, Mr. Li, has never called on practitioners to commit suicide, that in fact he forbids it, and that he has not demanded that followers forgo medical treatment. 
Of followers known to have died of illness, the government has not tried to determine how many were attracted to the spiritual movement as a last desperate measure after they had already been diagnosed with terminal cancers or other diseases.

HEADLINE: Against a Trend, U.S. Population Will Bloom, U.N. Says 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
Alone among major industrial countries, the United States will continue to grow markedly in population during the next half century, a result of the largest intake of immigrants anywhere and a higher fertility rate than that of other rich nations, says a United Nations analysis to be published Wednesday.
 By 2050 the United States will be the only developed country among the world's 20 most populous nations, an international team of demographers predicts. In 1950 at least half of the top 10 were industrial nations. In 2000 there were still three, including Japan and Russia. 
 In broader terms, demographers confirm that the world is witnessing a huge population shift to the third world, where poverty and limited resources are already hampering development and propelling migration within and between countries. 
By 2050 the population of the less developed countries is expected to grow from 4.9 billion to 8.2 billion, while the more developed countries will hold at 1.2 billion.
"These changing relationships have enormous economic, social and political consequences," said Joseph Chamie, the director of the United Nations population division. "They are basically the foundation for relations among countries and groups within countries. In brief, numbers matter."
At the Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit organization in Washington, Diana Cornelius, a demographer, said population projections were important. 
"One reason is because of links to consumption and therefore to the environment," she said, citing the need to plan for future services like health, housing, education and jobs.
In December, the Central Intelligence Agency's National Foreign Intelligence Board published a set of projections, "Global Trends 2015: A Dialogue About the Future With Nongovernment Experts," which linked population to economic and social trends and security concerns.
As examples of the world's rapidly changing profile, Mr. Chamie compares Europe with Africa and South Asia, dominated by India, which will replace China as the most populous nation within half a century.
"After World War II, Europe accounted for 22 percent of the world population and Africa 8 percent," he said. "Today they are about the same, about 13 percent, but by 2050 Africa is expected to be three times larger than Europe."
Growth in Africa is expected to be so strong, the demographers found, that tens of millions of deaths from AIDS will only slow, not reverse it. In sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa is the only exception. There, lower fertility coupled with AIDS-related deaths could result in a declining growth rate, the survey found.
India, with a population about two and a half times that of the European Union countries, is growing much faster than some earlier predictions suggested. "In 2000, the E.U. had a natural increase of 343,000 people," Mr. Chamie said. "India achieved this in the first week of 2001. If you add migration to Europe, the net growth would be about 1.2 million. India grew that much in the first three weeks of the year."
The United Nations report has calculated higher birth rate estimates than previously for India, Nigeria and Bangladesh, among other nations where efforts to slow population growth are taking longer than predicted.
The United Nations has slightly revised upward the projected world population for 2050, to 9.3 billion from 8.9 billion, based on a possible range from 7.9 billion to 10.9 billion.
At the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, Nicholas Eberstadt, a demographer and political scientist, said population projections had to be viewed skeptically.
"There is no scientific basis to long-range population prediction," he said in an interview, "because no one has figured out how to estimate how many babies currently unborn babies are going to have. So when you look half a century out, you're into science fiction." All demographers can ever do, he said, is provide an educated glimpse of what the world may look like in the future.
The new figures have some thought-provoking information, he said, including a change in an "arbitrary assumption that immigration from poorer to richer areas of the world was going to decrease progressively." But he said immigration alone did not account for America's fertility rate. 
"The U.S. is the most fertile of developed nations," he said, just above the replacement rate of 2.0, to replace two parents. He discounts ethnicity as the major cause.
"Even if you tried to match European-Americans with their country of origins, fertility would be higher than in Europe," he said. "New wealth doesn't explain it. My pet theory -- and you can't prove this -- is that it has to do with greater religiosity than in Europe or Japan." 
Whatever the cause, he said, "We are the only developed country today that is anywhere near replacement level, and nobody has an explanation for it."
One of the findings of the United Nations survey is that the current imbalance of populations between Israel, at 6 million, and the Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, at 3.2 million, is likely to shift dramatically in 50 years, with Israel's population projected at 10.1 million and the Palestinians' at 11.8 million.
At the Population Reference Bureau, Ms. Cornelius said that although projections were not predictions, but the result of "a mathematical exercise," they had to be taken seriously. "The future population is dependent on who is already alive and how old they are," she said. "Children are already born who are going to become parents, so we know there are going to be very large numbers of people in their childbearing years, long into the future."

HEADLINE: Iraqi, Ending U.N. Talks, Dismisses Powell Pledge as a Ploy 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
As the United States tries to revitalize a common front on Iraq in the Security Council, an Iraqi delegation ended two days of talks here today with little to show but their determination to stay in the game as events move around them.
 Iraq's foreign minister, Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf, who led the delegation in the first real discussions with the United Nations in more than two years, dismissed Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's pledges to rethink sanctions to ease the sufferings of ordinary Iraqis as a ploy "to deceive public opinion." 
 For good measure, he also rejected the head of a new arms inspection commission, Hans Blix, as "a detail" of a Security Council plan that Iraq would never accept.
"We are not dealing with a detail," Mr. Sahhaf said as he left the building this afternoon at the end of the talks. "You know our position in regard to Resolution 1284," the Council resolution creating a new inspection system in December 1999. "We are not going to deal with it, and Mr. Blix is a detail of that bad resolution." 
But Mr. Sahhaf, who confined his official contacts in New York to Secretary General Kofi Annan and a team of high-level United Nations officials, said repeatedly that he wanted to keep the door open. He told reporters that another round of talks would be held within a few weeks.
Diplomats are awaiting some outline of what "smart sanctions" the new Bush administration may have in mind for Iraq. Some ideas already floated here have been rejected by the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein.
For example, for years the United Nations has been urging Iraq to accept cash from supervised oil sales -- now nearing a total of $40 billion since 1996 -- to help restart the local economy. The Iraqis have refused to do so, officials say, because it would put even a small amount of economic power into the hands of citizens.
Lifting controls on a wide range of imports to meet civilian needs began more than a year ago, but Iraq has not always ordered the relief goods officials say the country's people need most.
Iraqi officials counter that their goal is not easing sanctions, but rather ending the embargo. Iraq also chafes at the requirement that money from oil sales go into an escrow account administered by the United Nations. 
No Security Council member advocates ending that system any time soon, as long as Iraq refuses arms inspections. The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and are to remain in place until United Nations inspectors have certified that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
Western and Arab diplomats said the timing of Mr. Sahhaf's visit was important, coming as it did while a White House review of sanctions was getting under way and the Arab League was preparing for a summit-level meeting next month, at which the Iraqi embargo would be on the agenda. Some diplomats are suggesting that the Iraqis may not have much time to make some gesture of cooperation, but that it did not necessarily have to be on arms inspections.
Hussein A. Hassouna, the Arab League's representative at the United Nations, said in an interview today that the issue of missing Kuwaiti civilians and soldiers a decade after the end of the Persian Gulf war was still important to Iraq's neighbors as well as a prerequisite to Iraq's freeing itself from United Nations supervision.
"We urge them always to try to move on the question of the prisoners of war, " Mr. Hassouna said. "If they show any cooperation on that, or give any information, this would improve the climate."
As they have done for more than three years, the Iraqis made clear this week their resolve to avoid all contact not only with arms inspectors but with the Security Council itself, and Mr. Sahhaf suggested at one point that Iraq wanted to use the secretary general as a go-between.
Mr. Annan, who will brief the Security Council on Wednesday on his talks with the Iraqis, told reporters this morning that any change in sanctions, which the Iraqis continue to want lifted without conditions, would be a matter for the Council to decide.

Appeals Court Questions Order to Split Up Microsoft
The government suffered a second difficult day in its Microsoft antitrust case when a federal appeals court cast doubt about a judge's order last year to break the company in two.
 Most of the seven judges on the appeals panel posed difficult questions to a Justice Department lawyer about the justification for the breakup, noting that the only companies ever broken up in the 111-year history of the Sherman Antitrust Act had been formed through mergers and acquisitions.

AT&T to Sell Some Cable Systems
Furthering its effort to reduce debt, AT&T said that it would sell some cable television systems in the United States and its stake in Japan Telecom for a total of $3.6 billion. Mediacom Communications, based in Middletown, N.Y., said that it would pay $2.2 billion in cash for cable operations serving 840,000 customers in Georgia, Illinois, Iowa and Missouri. And Vodafone Group of Britain confirmed that it had agreed to buy AT&T's 10 percent stake in Japan Telecom for $1.35 billion. Shares of AT&T rose $1.07, to $22.91. C5.

Nasdaq Drops in Technology Slump
Technology stocks fell sharply, pulling the Nasdaq composite index down more than 4 percent, after more sour economic reports failed to prompt an immediate cut in interest rates. Nasdaq dropped 100.68 points, or 4.4 percent, to 2,207.82. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 9.71 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,257.94, while the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.65 points, to 10,636.88. C16.

Uniquely Suited to Retail Industry
Before Brian K. Devine, the chief executive of Petco Animal Supplies in San Diego, joined the private sector with Toys "R" Us, he worked in government for the National Center for Health Statistics. "I'd spent a lot of years trying to change the world and helped change the world. But I'd lost some of my enthusiasm," he said. As a child, he operated a lemonade stand, worked as a caddy, delivered newspapers by bicycle and set pins in a bowling alley. That wide range of experience may have prepared him for the retail world. "Retail is change," he said. "Every day brings new problems and new challenges, so it's fun." C10.

CBS Executive Confirms Clinton Call
Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, confirmed that he received a phone call from former President Bill Clinton about six months ago in which the president asked him to "be nice" to the Hollywood producer Harry Thomason. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse First Boston, under pressure from clients, distanced itself from an entertainment industry conference at which Mr. Clinton spoke. A15.

A Plaza Few Use But Everyone Wants

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
Apartment dwellers need open space. Investment banks need trading space. And in Lower Manhattan, where every inch is precious, the two needs are colliding over an elevated one-acre public plaza at 55 Water Street.
 The Goldman Sachs Group proposes to eliminate the 28-year-old plaza -- a landscaped expanse of red brick that offers commanding East River views to anyone intrepid enough to ascend -- and replace it with a 240-foot-high building, having at least seven vast trading floors. 
 To make up for the loss of open space, Goldman Sachs would pay for $5 million in improvements nearby. It would furnish a 1,300-foot stretch of East River esplanade, from Old Slip to the Battery Maritime Building, with a bike path, a walkway and seating; landscape a barren public area in front of 55 Water Street; and contribute to the renovation of Vietnam Veterans Plaza on the south side of the tower.
In the eyes of nearby residents and an overwhelming majority of Community Board 1, however, these improvements are inadequate. They would not make up for the loss of what the board last week called a "substantial open public space and amenity" that was "provided to the community as compensation" for a far larger office tower than zoning rules would otherwise have allowed.
Which invites a question as the fight over 55 Water Street goes before the City Planning Commission today: just whose downtown is it, anyway? By community, does one mean the residential pioneers who came to settle an embryonic neighborhood, or a business that can trace its history in Lower Manhattan to 1869, when Marcus Goldman set up shop on Pine Street?
"We view this as much our community as everybody else does," said Barry Zubrow, chief administrative officer of Goldman Sachs. "We've always tried to be a good neighbor in the community and have worked hard to conduct ourselves in a responsible way."
Those who live at 3 Hanover Square, a 205-unit co-op at William and Stone Streets that would lose sunlight and river vistas to the new Goldman Sachs building, do not regard the project as particularly neighborly.
"The city encouraged residents to move into the financial district because there were a lot of empty buildings," said Philip Grieve, who has lived on Hanover Square for 15 years. "Now, after people have done that, they're saying they're going to take away our public space."
But it is a public space with few champions.
"There's no there there," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, which manages the Lower Manhattan business improvement district. "It's not like having a 41,000-square-foot park that tens of thousands of people use."
Joseph B. Rose, the chairman of the City Planning Commission and director of the City Planning Department, which worked with Goldman Sachs to draft the necessary rezoning, said the 55 Water Street plaza was "more of an aspiration than a tangible public benefit."
Fifty-four steps above street level -- and even farther off the beaten path -- the plaza is one of the largest privately owned public spaces in New York. It was designed by M. Paul Friedberg & Partners for Uris Brothers, the developers of 55 Water Street. The plaza yielded a floor-area bonus of 410,000 square feet, based on a ratio of 10 square feet of office space for every square foot of open space.
What the public got was an expansive and imaginatively landscaped space, its curving upper terrace planted with two dozen trees. The plaza was to have been part of an elevated pedestrian network envisioned in the 1960's. But connecting walkways were never built.
Today, it is isolated, barren, usually deserted and sometimes downright scary. A concession stand has long since been boarded up and the fountains silenced.
Escalators to the plaza have frequently not worked in the past (and were not operating yesterday and Monday). In the 1980's, when 55 Water Street was owned by Olympia & York, stairways to the plaza were barricaded for years.
Today, 55 Water Street is owned by the Retirement Systems of Alabama, from which Goldman Sachs would lease the space being vacated next year by J. P. Morgan Chase & Company. The complex includes a 53-story south tower and 15-story north tower; half of Vietnam Veterans Plaza, which is under reconstruction; a public plaza on Water Street; and the elevated plaza overlooking South Street and Old Slip.
To build the new 13-story, 750,000-square-foot trading structure, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, Goldman Sachs would eliminate the elevated plaza and alter the north tower, adding 35 feet to its height. The trading floors would have 56,000 square feet, an extraordinary amount of room in the cramped financial district.
"The need for space that can accommodate trading is acute," Mr. Weisbrod said.
The project's cost has been estimated at $850 million. The company might apply for financial incentives from the city and state. Completion of the building is expected at the end of 2004.
"We continue to be committed to keeping our world headquarters in downtown New York," Mr. Zubrow said. Besides the headquarters at 85 Broad Street, Goldman Sachs leases large blocks at 10 Hanover Square, 1 Liberty Plaza, 180 Maiden Lane, 1 New York Plaza, 32 Old Slip and 77 Water Street.
"We need to look at ways to bring together a number of our trading operations," Mr. Zubrow said. "We want our space to be flexible enough to allow us to adjust to the changing trading-floor environment over the next 50 years."
The Goldman Sachs proposal would increase the size of 55 Water Street to 3.18 million square feet from 2.91 million square feet. Although the trading structure would add 489,000 square feet of physical space, zoning rules generally exempt mechanical space from floor-area calculations and therefore would count the increase as only 267,000 square feet.
To compensate for the loss of the elevated plaza and other changes, Goldman Sachs proposes to acquire 364,000 square feet of unused development rights, known as air rights, from the low-rise South Street Seaport district.
Madelyn Wils, the chairwoman of Community Board 1, said that to earn the extra floor area, Goldman Sachs should create additional public space, perhaps in the form of an indoor recreational area or a renovated East River pier. She added that she was hopeful a deal could be reached.
Although details remain to be settled, Mr. Rose said the proposal would accommodate business needs, provide better public amenities and uphold the "integrity, intent and spirit" of the zoning law.
But Jonathan Greenspan, the president of the co-op board of 3 Hanover Square, sees the proposal as a retreat from sound planning policy. "If you live across the street from a public space that was granted by the city in exchange for bonus floor area, that open space should be guaranteed," he said.
"It is somewhat ironic," he said, "that part of the reward for neglecting a public plaza is giving the ownership the right to not only eliminate the public space but to add a 750,000-square-foot building on the site."

HEADLINE: Report Underlines Risk of Japan Recession 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Japan's industrial production slumped a surprising 3.9 percent in January, the government said today, providing more evidence of a sharp economic slowdown and helping to send the Tokyo stock market to a 15-year low.
 The Nikkei 225 average fell 2.11 percent in the early afternoon to 12,784.17, its lowest since Dec. 10, 1985, as investors shortened the odds of a return to recession after a decade of slow, on-and-off growth. 
 "It's a very bleak number," said Garry Evans, a strategist with HSBC Securities. "The risk of Japan going back into outright recession is a very real risk."
Just as troubling as the drop in industrial production was a 0.6 percent increase in inventories, following a 0.1 percent drop in December, suggesting that manufacturers will have to cut output further to work off stockpiles of unsold goods.
The weakness fanned speculation that the Bank of Japan, whose policy-making board was meeting today, might be jolted to emulate the United States Federal Reserve and try to help the economy by easing credit further.
Even before today's report, Japan was flirting with recession, commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of shrinking production.
Gross domestic product dropped 0.6 percent in the July-September quarter, and figures for the final three months of 2000, due next month, are expected to show modest growth at best.

Revving Up the Search Engines to Keep the E-Aisles Clear

BYLINE:  By LISA GUERNSEY 

 BODY:
IN the real world, the search for something like a red medium-size women's sweater hardly ranks as a shopping challenge. Just go to a clothing store, head for the women's section, scan the sweater aisles or ask for help. 
 Online, the situation is altogether different. Searching for a specific product becomes akin to a quest for the holy grail with the wrong map. You are convinced that the product is out there. But you must rely on the site's search engine to find it -- and the results are either messages about "no matches" or a jumble of irrelevant links. 
 More than two-thirds of online retail sites tested last spring by Forrester Research failed to list the most relevant content in the first page of search results. No wonder sites have suffered from an inability to convert browsers into buyers. Customers are literally being driven away by weak search technology. 
To overcome the problem, some online shops have introduced a search tool that was designed to provide smarter, more relevant answers to queries. Traditional search software retrieves pages of information and then creates indexes using tools like a thesaurus, which ensures that when people type the word "sweater" they also receive results that contain the word "pullover." The new search tool goes a step further by directly searching a company's catalog databases, pulling information into tables and categories that are useful to the customer.
"Search becomes a matter of slicing and dicing your catalog in as many different ways as you want," said Paul R. Hagen, a senior analyst at Forrester.
The technology's strength, analysts say, is that it notes the relationships between columns and rows in the company's databases. This means that a search engine can find a medium-size cashmere cardigan with shell buttons by, say, scanning a table about sweaters, homing in on the rows that feature cardigans with the requested fabric and buttons, and, lastly, checking to see whether they are available in medium. By exploiting that underlying database structure, they say, information can be retrieved more precisely than if the search engine was simply combing through Web pages for some version of the searcher's words.
"If you are missing the structure, you are lost," said Yaron Dycian, director of product marketing for Mercado Software in Fremont, Calif., which provides database search tools.
The approach has another advantage. Because the search results are being pulled out of a company's database, Mr. Hagen said, a company can let its customers re-sort the results by a range of details, like a product's availability. 
Larry R. Harris, the founder and chairman of EasyAsk, a database-search company in Littleton, Mass., considers this the best way of assuring that customers find out when an item is out of stock.
"A text-based search engine would still be displaying those products and letting people try to order them," Mr. Harris said, because many of those engines comb through a premade index of information that might have been compiled hours, if not days, before. 
Other companies that develop database-oriented technology include Fact City in Waltham, Mass., iPhrase in Cambridge, Mass., and Requisite Technology, in Westminster, Colo. 
According to Mr. Hagen's analysis, the cost of buying and putting together sophisticated search systems is about $520,000 for a 20,000-page Web site, the size of online retailers like CDNow and Compaq.
WebVan, the online grocery service, has been using the Mercado system since last fall. To get started, WebVan allowed Mercado to scan its database and build a search tool that understood the categories and levels in its underlying structure. 
Now when a person searches WebVan's site for, say, "Vidalia onions," the search engine pulls up several options, including "Vidalia sweet onions," as well as frozen burgers and ketchup with Vidalia onions. After the user clicks on a photo of the onions, an interactive chart shows how the database was searched. 
A similar strategy appears to be working for Tower Records, another Mercado client. Before using the company's software, Tower officials said 2.5 percent of visitors who browsed the Web site bought something. In 1999, after installing a database-oriented search service, the conversion rate of browsers to buyers jumped to at least twice that. 
Still, not everyone is convinced that continually searching a company's database is the answer to a Web site's search problems. 
Verity, a software developer in Sunnyvale, Calif., that has been creating search tools since 1987, has focused on engines that dig into multilayered indexes of the information in databases instead of extracting data from the database itself. About 25 percent of its customers are applying the search engines to e-commerce sites, including CDNow, Home Depot and the Sharper Image.
"What we hear from customers is, 'Don't probe our database,' " said Prabhakar Raghavan, chief scientist and vice president for emerging technologies at Verity. Some of its clients worry that the performance of the database will suffer or that the search time will increase. 
Mr. Hagen, the Forrester analyst, said he had not seen any evidence that database searching was any slower than other methods. But regardless, he urges Web retailers to take a look at the options for improving the search process. 
When he wrote his latest report on e-tailers' search technology in June, he titled it Must Search Stink? Too often, he said, the tools required searchers to try keyword after keyword to find what they were looking for. Now, he said, he is more encouraged as he sees companies trying to figure out how to make their search engines more sophisticated instead of relying on searchers to become more sophisticated.
"You can choose to blame the user" and lose sales, he said. "Or you can make a smarter tool."

To Guide Hunt, Follow Context
AS Web sites improve their search engines, one question inevitably comes up: Although no one really expects search engines to read minds, is it too much to ask that they at least understand the context behind the queries? 
Any relatively educated person can see that keywords like "tiger" and "woods" mean different things to a zoologist and a golf fan. Could search technology someday make the same distinction?
Maybe so, according to search companies driven by the idea that even though searchers may use only one or two keywords, they provide clues that can be used to make search engines smarter. Here are some examples of how such contextual hints are being used:
WHERE YOU ARE -- "Where the users are searching from has a lot to do with what they are looking for," said Jud Bowman, president and chief executive of Pinpoint.com, a search-engine company in Durham, N.C.
If people are visiting Cancer.org, Mr. Bowman said, and they type "survivor" into its search engine, they probably do not want to see sites about "Survivor," the television program. 
Pinpoint's technology filters out irrelevant links by finding sites that fit a specific profile. The profiles are created by a program that scans a preselected set of Web pages that have been considered relevant to a specific topic.
The software notes the placement and pattern of words and then sends a "crawler" -- an Internet-based software agent -- onto the Web to find pages that match. 
In addition to Cancer.org, Pinpoint's clients include Golf.com and MotorWRX.com, a portal for car enthusiasts.
WHERE YOU'VE BEEN -- Most sites are able to make note of the sites their visitors are coming from. So when a Web user types the word "screwdriver" into a search engine after visiting a home renovation site, it could pull up references to screwdriver, the tool, and play down links to screwdriver, the mixed drink. 
Verity, a search-engine company in Sunnyvale, Calif., has been studying how this strategy can enhance its products, said Prabhakar Raghavan, chief scientist and vice president for emerging technologies. 
"One of the strongest indicators of what a consumer will buy is the site they came from," Mr. Raghavan said.
HELP ALONG THE WAY -- If words can be meaningless when taken out of context, why take them out of context? That is the philosophy behind search services that enable people to highlight a keyword in its natural environment, in a sentence or paragraph, and then hit a "search" button. With the help of those surrounding words, search tools can do a more educated search. 
Using downloaded software, the service kicks in whenever a person highlights a word (whether it is a Web site, e-mail message or word-processing document) and then right-clicks with the mouse.
Some examples of these tools can be found at Zapper.com, Annotate.net and FlySwat.com. 
GETTING TO KNOW YOU -- What if a search engine could get to know its user so well that it knew which results would be most relevant?
David Lowe, an engineering and information-retrieval professor at Southern Cross University in Australia, is interested in developing a system that develops profiles by tracking users over time. That kind of search engine could know that a doctor who often reads medical journals online is probably trying to find more medical journals.
At least one company is developing such a system: PurpleYogi, of Mountain View, Calif. Over time, Purple Yogi learns what its users like and serves up similar pages, avoiding those sites about Bengali tigers that might otherwise pop up in a search for information on golf's top player.

Putting 401(k)'s Online: Add Choice, Save Trees

BYLINE:  By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
TO broaden retirement benefits for his 125 employees, John Maultsby Jr., the president of Florida Plywood Inc. in Greenwood, Fla., began offering a 401(k) plan in 1999. Employee payroll deductions were partly matched by the company, and employees could invest among eight mutual funds managed by First Union Bank of Charlotte, N.C.
 Many of the workers were inexperienced at investing and bewildered by their choices. "You could see on their faces," Mr. Maultsby said, "that they wanted help to make their pick." 
 His solution was to offer online financial advice from mPower Advisors, a San Francisco company that recommends investment allocations to workers at 130 companies. The cost for the service, which is tailored to the employer's funds, is $20 to $50 a worker annually.
To help employees use the site, Mr. Maultsby and another supervisor tutored them personally. A few people made portfolio picks on their own, but most took their cues from mPower, which tailors recommendations according to information supplied by the employee.
Both old and new economy employers are relying more on the Internet to help deliver and manage employee benefits. According to a report by Forrester Research, a third of employers are using Web-based benefit management systems, and more than half of them plan to abandon their paper systems in the next five years.
The reasons for the shift to the Web are many: it eliminates annual printing costs and simplifies the administration of benefits. In addition, as with Florida Plywood, Web-based systems give employees more choices. The systems also serve business owners by shifting the decision-making to employees and taking the employers out of the middleman role.
In response to demand, new online companies that offer benefit networks are moving to compete with established consultants like Marsh & McLennan and Hewitt Associates.
Among the start-ups is Myhealthbank in Portland, Ore., which is partnered with Regence BlueCross BlueShield of Oregon, the state's largest insurer. Aiming to meet the needs of small and midsize employers, Myhealthbank uses a "defined benefit" approach that gives employees discretion over how to spend a set amount of money budgeted by the employer for health care. This approach to health care parallels the self-directed strategies that 401(k) plans offer to retirement savings.
Myhealthbank displays an employer's health benefit in a dollar value in an online account. By choosing different premium levels or "co-pays" for office visits, prescription drugs, dental or vision care, employees can buy the plan that suits their needs.
Last October, Jerry Thenell, the owner of Shelton-Turnbull Printers, a 110-employee union print shop in Eugene, Ore., dropped his insurer for Myhealthbank to avoid a 16 percent increase in health care premiums. Besides keeping costs steady, the service has had another result.
"All of a sudden, they have a choice," Mr. Thenell said of his employees, who were coached by Myhealthbank's staff on how to use its site and enroll for benefits. "Our people totally love that." 
ABOUT 30 younger print-shop workers chose less coverage, thus lowering their premiums and increasing their take-home pay. Four employees with families did the reverse, preferring to pay an additional $50 a month in premiums to eliminate co-payments at the doctor's office.
Large employers, especially ones with intranets, are pushing benefit consultants to provide Web-based services that decrease the paperwork required for each annual employee enrollment period, as well as streamline the continuous bill paying and reconciliation process with insurance carriers.
Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill., has spent millions of dollars creating an online benefits platform, called Sageo.com. Sageo offers employers a standard format for electronic health-and-welfare benefit enrollment that is less costly to administer than a paper system. 
"By using the Web, it puts more at people's fingertips," said Robert A. Toohey, a vice president of Genuity Inc., a computer network builder and servicing company in Woburn, Mass., and a Sageo client. Mr. Toohey said that the majority of Genuity's 4,800 employees across several states made this year's benefit adjustments through Sageo's password-protected Web site.
Putting benefits management online also conveys a message about a company's culture. 
"It would be hard to portray us as a cutting-edge company if we are delivering a phone book to everyone's mailbox," said the company's corporate communications director, Vaughn F. Harring, referring to employee benefit directories.
The gorilla of the benefits business is the Fidelity Employer Services Company, a unit of Fidelity Investments in Boston. Besides managing funds for its eight million retail customers, Fidelity manages 401(k) funds for another eight million people at 7,000 large companies. Using Fidelity's Internet site, 401k.com, employees can obtain portfolio guidance -- for example, calculate their risk tolerance or how a change in income will affect retirement.
"The trend now is to bundle it all in one place," said Peter J. Smail, the president of Fidelity's employer-services unit which, besides providing retirement information, offers payroll and health benefits through intranet portals for clients like the Mead Corporation, a forest products manufacturer in Dayton, Ohio. 
Last year, Mr. Smail said, twice as many companies sought their services than in the year before. "Benefits administration isn't a core business," he said. "It's harder for them to justify the heavy investment."

HEADLINE: What the Web Means In Tougher Times 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
LAST year, even before dot-coms started to splat all over Silicon Valley sidewalks, wise watchers of the Internet liked to say that the real action was elsewhere -- in the hundreds of millions of dollars that old-economy companies were spending to improve their efficiency. These transformations, while less than glamorous, would allow them to grow faster than ever.
 But growth is not a word heard often in any context these days, and companies are reassessing their Web strategies in light of the sudden economic slowdown. Some are pulling back, while others are speeding up spending, hoping to find even greater savings in everything from purchasing to training workers. And some companies are acting on this discovery: a technology that lets you do more with the same number of people also lets you do the same amount of business with fewer people. 
 In other words, Americans who have become used to getting mail, books and even cars online may now be receiving pink slips as a result of the Internet. 
When the mutual fund giant Janus announced earlier this month that it was cutting 468 jobs, it said that part of the reason was the company's successful customer service Web site. Just as automated teller machines have replaced armies of bank workers, Web-based customer service has put the squeeze on Janus's phone staff. "Like many companies, Janus has embraced technology to deliver the kind of service our shareholders want," Margie Hurd, the president of the company's customer-support subsidiary, said in a statement. "We've started to realize significant operating efficiencies, which has inevitably resulted in the elimination of some positions."
Janus acknowledged that some of the job cuts were due to a drop-off in customer calls. But the success of the company's Web site has left those who answer the phone with idle time as well: 62 percent of the investors who contacted the company in December 2000 did so online, compared with just 34 percent in January 1999. Even the time-consuming process of opening accounts is migrating online, with 20 percent of all new accounts being opened on the company's Web site, www.janus.com, since the company began offering that choice.
Technological change has always led to shifts in the workplace, including layoffs. But what is different about the new-economy environment is that automation is reaching higher up the employment hierarchy than before, replacing workers like stock analysts and purchasing-department employees.
Such cuts, to be sure, are only one option that companies are choosing to weather the slowdown, and many economists rate them among the least appealing uses of the Web. Andrew Whinston, the director of the Center for Research in Electronic Commerce at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas, said that the companies making the smartest use of the Internet to prepare for a possible recession were those that are introducing efficiencies at many levels.
That does allow companies to cut their job rolls, either through dismissals or attrition -- "You're substituting Internet technology for labor," Mr. Whinston said. But the point should be cutting waste, not workers, he added.
Similarly, Robert E. Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said that companies should be reluctant to lay off people in light of the struggle in recent years to find good employees in an overheated labor market. Instead, "they'll try to think smarter," he said. "They'll try to think of ways to save money on paper clips, reorganize their office."
But that could change. "If the downturn gets really bad, companies don't care about that," he said. "They'll say, 'Look, we can't pay you.' "
The newest way of saving money on paper clips, of course, is buying them through the Internet, and, in particular, buying them on the Internet through an overhaul of the supply chain. As a result, many companies appear to be willing to continue to spend money to save money, even though companies generally put off making investments like new computer systems during hard times.
This is true even in companies not associated with high technology. The Dana Corporation, an auto parts supplier, for instance, is continuing to put its money down, expecting a payoff in savings over time. "What we're doing is actually accelerating our efforts" to move to electronic purchasing, sales and auctions, said Douglas J. Grimm, the vice president for global strategic sourcing at Dana. The company, based in Toledo, Ohio, will spend "tens of millions" of dollars to complete plans to marry its processes with Internet technology, he said.
Dana announced earlier this month that bad times for automakers had hurt the company's earnings, with its annual net income dropping to $334 million from $513 million the year before. Dana said it would lay off 10,000 people and close 10 plants. But the company also announced that it would try to wring more savings for the company by increasing its use of the Internet. The real focus, Mr. Grimm said, is finding common ground for the 140 companies that Dana has bought in the last 40 years and its scores of incompatible data systems. Connecting all its operations and making them accessible through the Web is transforming the company, Mr. Grimm said. "All of a sudden, my buyers in Taiwan, Germany and Indiana can suddenly see the same data live."
On a larger scale, industry leaders like General Electric say that downturns are the best time to increase spending on information technology.
"Our competitive advantage is in belt-tightening times; we like to throw more money" at information technology investment, said Pam Wickham, a G.E. spokeswoman. "It's good for us if our competition is not increasing spending."
Several companies that sell the tools others use on the Internet are pointing to possibilities that include reduced work forces. The Oracle Corporation has built its current marketing campaign around the money it says it has saved on its operations by using its own software, which helps companies centralize and shrink their information technology departments. The company predicts that by later this year it will have cut the 1,500 people on its information technology staff to 900.
At Cisco, the company that sells much of the hardware that makes the Internet work, its leading e-business consultant said that a slowing economy made companies look more closely at the money they spend on Internet-based efficiency.
"When there's a period of economic uncertainty, all of us become more aware of where we're spending our money," said Susan L. Bostrom, a senior vice president for the company's Internet business solutions group. Ms. Bostrom helps Cisco's customers determine how to make online technologies work.
Most companies, she said, are neither plunging in nor giving up but taking a more cautious, focused approach to technology purchases. Because of such watchfulness, she said, "I see a higher involvement level of the C.E.O. and business executives" in making sure that the companies make the most effective purchases -- a situation that Ms. Bostrom said helped ensure a successful technology initiative.
Two insurance companies that Ms. Bostrom has worked with recently, Farmers and Allianz, focused heavily on improving customer service and training their thousands of agents. Baxter Healthcare, the medical devices giant, invested heavily in improving the company's internal communications so that workers could simplify functions like filing expenses -- initiatives that produce savings relatively quickly and pave the way for broader changes down the road, she said. 
Stephen N. David, the chief information officer at Procter & Gamble, said that he thought that Internet spending by corporations was not slowing down, but "there is certainly a lot more pressure for 'what can this do for me now.' "
"Over the last 18 to 24 months, industries have focused more on activities, not outcomes," he said. "I think right now what we're trying to do is focus on what we're trying to achieve and how to do it faster."
Some initiatives, like simplifying the way employees find information within the company, "certainly could lead to redeployment or downsizing," he said. But there are more important tasks, he said, like reducing the time needed to process orders, making more information available to consumers and speeding up product development. Consumer reaction to new product concepts that used to take two months to gather now takes a day or two to collect on the Web, he said. Sometimes new ideas are tested on one set of customers in the morning, revised and shown to another the same day.
Mr. David also said that concern for speeding up cost-cutting was putting more pressure on the technical groups that are writing the standards that would allow many of the hypothetical efficiencies to actually take place.
New-economy efficiencies are being sought by all kinds of companies. Businesses in the construction trades -- literally brick-and-mortar companies -- are turning to business-to-business marketplaces that are provided by companies like Equalfooting, which automate bidding and buying for half a million products. James F. Fox, a co-founder of Equalfooting, said that his 200,000 member companies realized savings in two ways: by attracting more bidders on sales of everything from hinges and screws to gloves to air compressors, which tends to drive prices down, and by more efficient use of purchasing agents' time. The transition to online bidding from calling suppliers individually for price quotes on an item like work gloves, he said, means "Going from two hours to -- no kidding -- two minutes."
He acknowledged that large corporations might be tempted to take the second kind of savings and use it to cut jobs, but he said that for most midsize and small companies, it did not make good sense unless the country slides into a true recession.
"The cost of hiring good people is so expensive that you really have to be loath to let somebody go," Mr. Fox said. "What you want to do during this time is not have to incur the cost of hiring someone."
Makers of e-commerce software don't brag that their products can put people out of work. But they don't deny reality, either.
"If you make a proposition that says, 'I'm going to make you more efficient,' you are by definition saying, 'I'm going to help you cut people,' " said Shikhar Ghosh, the chief executive of Verilytics, a company that creates software that automates the work of stock analysts.
He describes a meeting with a consultant who was helping the company prepare for pitching its products to a major financial institution. When Mr. Ghosh explained that the company's software, which scours Web sites for financial data and performs calculations, can do in minutes what it takes human portfolio managers hours to do, the consultant saw the light. "He said, 'Therefore, they're going to need half the number of people to do what they did before.' "
Mr. Ghosh insists, though, that the best use of his software is to introduce efficiencies that allow companies to expand without adding jobs. "They'll use the same number of people to do twice as much as they did before," he said. Ideally, Mr. Ghosh added, his products give his customer a competitive advantage. "This company grows faster than another company, and that company fires a portfolio manager."
So productivity, then, can be a double-edged sword. A more efficient economy does, in the long run, spread a measure of prosperity around, and no one gains from economic bloat for long. And Mr. Ghosh argues that even in hard times, the most productive companies grow and add jobs.
Even with unemployment levels still low, someone who has been told to clean out his desk is not exactly going to salute the efficiencies of the new economy on the way out the door.
As Shelly Petersen, a spokeswoman for Janus, said of laid-off call center workers: "Unfortunately, you can't turn these people into servers."

How Staunch Republicans Became a Dictator's Pals

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
NAPOLEON AND HIS COLLABORATORS
The Making of a Dictatorship
By Isser Woloch
281 pages. W. W. Norton & Company. $29.95.
 The French Revolution was of course a stupendous event, one that formed a template for subsequent political earthquakes, or at least a basis for comparison. There is a school of thought that sees the revolution's descent from the overthrow of royalist tyranny in 1789 to the Terror of 1793 as a strangely inevitable and tragic trajectory repeated in other upheavals, most notably the Russian Revolution of 1917. Then there is the emergence of Napoleon and the resurrection of a hereditary monarchy presided over by a tyrant not all that different from those who preceded him. 
 In his thoughtful and learned new book, "Napoleon and His Collaborators," the Columbia University historian Isser Woloch examines the implications of Napoleon's emergence as a new kind of strongman. Mr. Woloch shows, step by step, the manner by which Napoleon recreated a hereditary monarchy. Mr. Woloch's chief interest, however, is in the former moderates who had spent their lives in the service of a more liberal order but then chose to cooperate with the restored dictatorship. He calls them the collaborators, and they serve as points of reference for later figures who, in their own times and places, did much the same thing. 
"Napoleon did not vault onto the imperial throne but moved toward dictatorship gradually," Mr. Woloch writes, in a partial explanation for the complicity of others. "Each assertion of new power came gilded with a veneer of legality and a rhetoric of commitment to the principles of 1789."
In making his case, Mr. Woloch speaks more to readers with a special interest in the revolution and a good deal of knowledge about it than to those coming relatively uninformed to the subject. His writing is clear but often dry, and his focus is rather narrow, on political developments in France from 1799, when Napoleon was named first consul, to the decade following 1804, when, as Mr. Woloch puts it, "Napoleon placed the imperial crown on his own head."
The larger context for this event -- France's foreign relations, Napoleon's military campaigns, social and economic life -- are treated very skimpily here. Napoleon himself, his character, his loves, his generalship, what he was like, do not get extensive attention.
The question Mr. Woloch seeks to answer is why and how men who had devoted themselves to the cause of revolutionary liberty yielded to the ambitions of a new dictator. He begins by examining the group of moderate republican legislators who, tiring of factionalism and of the threat of resurgent Jacobin radicalism, engineered the coup that brought Napoleon to power.
Chief among them was Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyes, one of the theoreticians of 1789 who had largely withdrawn from the political scene. Sieyes, in Mr. Woloch's view, believed that the solution to French instability was a strong executive, represented by Napoleon, a parliament, and what he called a "third force," a body to mediate between the two of them. Though wary of Napoleon's ambitions, he nonetheless believed, as did many others, that only Napoleon could lead France out of its difficulties, and he therefore supported him. 
Still, the men who made Napoleon first consul in a new government created the method that was to be followed as Napoleon steadily increased his power and reduced French liberties. That method was "to cloak their constitutional coup in an aura of pseudo-legality," as Mr. Woloch puts it. 
Napoleon governed with a Senate and a Tribunate and, after he was named emperor, with constitutional bodies designed to curb abuses of power. But these institutions largely, if not entirely, gave the dictatorship that semi-legal gloss. Except in a few circumstances, Mr. Woloch shows, Napoleon was able to control the membership of the legislative bodies and essentially to turn them into rubber stamps. 
The men who allowed that to happen were, as Mr. Woloch shows, rather faceless in subsequent centuries even though their historical role was crucial. Among them was Jean-Jacques-Regis Cambaceres, to whom Mr. Woloch devotes a fascinating chapter. Cambaceres was the second most powerful figure in France, and a devoted servant to Napoleon, a position he maintained, Mr. Woloch argues, out of a mixture of motives: money, a genuine sense that there was no alternative, prestige, even a love of good food and wine, of which his status gave him a steady supply. 
Mr. Woloch goes on to trace the steady growth of the dictatorship and to assess the extent to which it was moderated by remaining revolutionary liberalism. Here he teases a complicated picture out of the historical record, one in which the Napoleonic bureaucracy had little success in curbing the imperial power. 
Napoleon's police minister, the intelligent and sinister Joseph Fouche, resorted frequently to preventive detention to crush popular discontent, a method, as Mr. Woloch points out, that restored practices of the old regime eliminated in the revolution. Built into the Napoleonic constitution was a senatorial commission empowered to investigate complaints of abuse of power, and Mr. Woloch shows that it succeeded in getting some prisoners released, but not very many. A similar commission charged with protecting freedom of the press and of publishing was even less effective.
Mr. Woloch concludes with some thoughtful observations on another time when senior government officials opposed to their leader's policies remained in office rather than resigning, in the United States during the Vietnam War. He concludes with no thundering moral judgments but rather an appreciation of how difficult the question is, of whether to work for something better within the system or to leave it. As Mr. Woloch shows, the issue as it presented itself more than 200 years ago still has a modern and even an urgent feel.

HEADLINE: When California Lights Dim; 
Utilities' Turmoil Also Hits Program That Aids Concerns Owned by Women And Minorities

BYLINE:  By BARBARA WHITAKER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
For years, the engineering company that Oscar Ocampo helped to found has benefited from a California program that pushed private utilities to increase contracts with minority- and women-owned businesses.
 Since 1986 when the company, the Ocampo Esta Corporation, was formed, it has grown from a company with three employees that grossed about $300,000 into one with 55 employees grossing more than $3 million last year. But with the energy crisis threatening the solvency of Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, which account for 90 percent of its business, Ocampo Esta is also facing uncertainty. 
 The company, which specializes in designing power plants and substations, has laid off 15 engineers and designers since December, and has scaled back the workweek for others.
"If they don't send out additional work soon, most of us will be unemployed," said Mr. Ocampo, who is Filipino. 
Ocampo Esta, based in Vallejo, Calif., is one of thousands of businesses participating in a state-directed, voluntary contracting program that for more than a decade has fostered relationships between California's investor-owned utilities and women- and minority-owned businesses. And some of these companies are now getting a very personal look at the reverse side of such relationships.
While companies doing business with the two utilities are being hurt across the board, participants in the state's supplier diversity program are typically small businesses and therefore highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the economy. And the more narrowly a company's services are tied to the utilities, the harder they seem to be hit. Pacific Gas and Southern California Edison faltered under deregulation when their retail rates were capped as wholesale energy prices soared.
The program, the Women, Minority and Disabled Veterans Business Enterprises Program for Public Utilities, grew out of legislation that made the California Public Utilities Commission responsible for carrying out guidelines to encourage the use of such enterprises.
Despite challenges over the years from opponents of affirmative action, the program has made California's utilities a national model for minority contracting efforts, and the heads of PG&E and Southern California Edison -- the state's biggest utilities -- have been in large part responsible for making it a success.
"Today, California's regulated utilities have the best record in the nation, not only among utilities, but all corporations in America," said Robert Gnaizda, general counsel for the Greenlining Institute, the economic development and minority advancement organization that monitors the program.
The turmoil driven by the energy crisis, however, is providing fodder for critics of affirmative action.
"The chickens have come home to roost," said Ward Connerly, chairman of the American Civil Rights Institute, a California-based nonprofit organization fighting race- and gender-based preference programs. "We're all at the mercy of our marketplace no matter what business we're in. When your marketplace is the preference pot and that preference pot dries up, you're in trouble."
The situation illustrates what he sees as a major flaw in affirmative action programs. Although they were created as a way of helping businesses to grow so they could better compete, all too often, Mr. Connerly said, the businesses became overly dependent on those revenue sources and "they fail to grow up."
In response to such comments by critics of the programs, Mr. Gnaizda replied: "Have you asked any of them if they've criticized any of the top 10 defense contractors who rely on government contracts?"
He and other advocates say that the state's program offers opportunities without establishing preferences or set-asides.
When it began 13 years ago, said Mr. Gnaizda, who represented civil rights groups pushing for the change, minority contracts were virtually nonexistent.
In 1988, six of the state's largest utilities, including PG&E and Southern California Edison, agreed to a goal of giving 20 percent of the dollar value of all contracts to minority- and women-owned companies, with three-quarters of that to the former and one-quarter to the latter. A stipulation that an additional 1.5 percent of contracts should go to companies owned by disabled veterans was added later.
In 1999, according to Public Utilities Commission figures, there were 14 participating utilities, reporting total procurement contracts of $5.9 billion. Nearly $1.7 billion, or more than 28 percent, of that was spent with companies owned by women, members of minority groups or disabled veterans.
Figures for 2000 are scheduled to be released Thursday, and both PG&E and Southern California Edison said they would meet or surpass the goal.
For James Espinosa, who opened Orange Coast Electrical Supply 20 years ago, minority contracting programs and government contracts helped keep him in business when he found himself in trouble just a few months after starting his business.
He had intended to provide electrical supplies to contractors in new construction. But when interest rates skyrocketed soon after he opened his doors, Mr. Espinosa, who is Hispanic, turned to minority trade shows to help cultivate business with industrial companies.
He soon began working with Southern California Edison, which already had a special minority businesses program, and later found work in the aerospace industry through government programs.
Asked what he thought would have happened without such programs Mr. Espinosa said, "I don't like to think about it." But today, he says, his business, based in Irvine, has outgrown the need for them.
"The premise we've always worked on is we're going to operate a good business that happens to be a minority-owned business," he said. "Right now, if all these minority programs were to go away, I don't think we would lose any business" over all.
While his sales to Southern California Edison are down 25 percent since December, Mr. Espinosa, who over the years expanded his product line and dropped the "Electrical" from the company's name, has been able to avoid layoffs by concentrating on serving the construction industry, which is still going strong in Southern California, and focusing on sales of janitorial supplies, hardware and safety equipment.
Mr. Espinosa notes that his relationship with Southern California Edison has at times been a demanding one, forcing him to compete for its business. In 1994, the utility began a program of strategic sourcing to reduce costs. As part of the bidding process, Southern California Edison asked vendors not just the price of a material, but for suggestions on how the bidder could reduce the company's cost of acquiring and handling it. Mr. Espinosa's company was among the winners, and he instituted many of the ideas throughout his business.
From there his business grew rapidly, and, although Southern California Edison has typically accounted for 40 percent of his business, overall sales have tripled over the last five years, and the business, which has continued to serve builders and the aerospace industry, has continued to grow.
For Mr. Ocampo, such a shift is a bigger undertaking. His engineering company specializes in serving the utilities, he said, not unlike a doctor who specializes in internal medicine. In fact, it was at PG&E's suggestion that he left his engineering job at Bechtel to go out on his own. .
After the hardships of the last few months, "we will change the way we do business," he said, noting that the remaining 10 percent of his work is with AT&T. "But it will be a little bit harder."
Should the utilities he deals with go bankrupt, he said, "we will be hit very hard."
The directors of the utilities' supplier diversity programs acknowledge that the future is uncertain.
Both they and the contractors are " just riding this wave," said Bonnie K. Wells, who directs the PG&E program. "No one is going to avoid the eventual impact."
Joseph F. Alderete, who runs Southern California Edison's program, said there had been a 10 percent cutback across the board in December. And beyond the cutbacks, he said, some of his contractors were confronted by banks that no longer wanted to lend them money. "They were kind of getting squeezed from both ends."
The Greenlining Institute has begun pushing for $1.2 billion in disaster relief funds to assist small businesses affected by the current situation.
But Mr. Connerly, the outspoken critic of affirmative action programs, said that if the state should step in to bail out the utilities he would be "first in line" to challenge the program under Proposition 209, which amended the state Constitution in 1996 to prohibit state and local governments from granting preferential treatment based on race or gender.
Mr. Gnaizda said he thought that the utilities program would continue to withstand challenges under the proposition, since the companies were private entities and there were no mandated goals or sanctions. He added, however, that he feared for the program should PG&E and Southern California Edison be replaced by other utilities that might not have the same commitment to it.
So far, at least, there are some participants in the program that are not experiencing any drop in business. Among them is Kimberly King, owner of King Security Services in San Francisco, whose contract with PG&E accounts for 10 to 15 percent of her business.
"We're in kind of a recession-proof industry," Ms. King said, adding that with PG&E under fire as a result of the energy crisis it needs her security services more than ever.
Even some owners of companies that are being hurt say they can extract some good from the energy debacle.
Pete Varma, who is Asian-Pacific and owns Intraline Inc., a Burlingame, Calif., company that supplies utility poles, line hardware and electrical products, said he his monthly sales had dropped $200,000 to $300,000 to an average of $120,000 a month. Since 80 percent of his sales are with PG&E and Southern California Edison, he is scrambling. While trying to cultivate business with high-technology companies, he is focusing on sales of energy-efficiency items, like fluorescent bulbs, since the crisis has highlighted the need for conservation.
"I always look for opportunity where there is a crisis," he said.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT; 
As Antidote to Slowdown, Intel Will Spend, Not Cut

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 27 

 BODY:
Intel, the world's leading maker of computer chips, said today that it would try to spend its way through the troubled economic times.
 Craig R. Barrett, the company's chief executive, told 5,000 people at the semiannual Intel Developer Forum here that he had seen a sharp slowdown in American manufacturing. The downturn prompted Intel last week to delay raises for employees and limit new hiring. 
 But Mr. Barrett rebutted a report from a Salomon Smith Barney analyst saying that Intel would reduce its spending budget, which calls for a $12 billion investment in research, development and production this year.
"You never save your way out of a recession," Mr. Barrett said. "The only way to get out of a recession stronger than you went into it is to have great new products." 
Last year was a difficult one for Intel. Competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, which produces chips for desktop personal computers, and Transmeta, a maker of fast chips for notebooks, brought new products to market. Intel faced shortages of components and could not hold off competitors as well as it had hoped.
Paul Otellini, an executive vice president and general manager of the Intel Architecture Group, acknowledged "missteps." But with several long-awaited products scheduled to reach the market, he and other executives view 2001 as a year to regain ground. 
Intel said its Itanium line of 64-bit chips, designed for high-end server systems, is on schedule for release in the second quarter. Production of the Pentium 4, intended for multimedia uses on desktop PC's, is expected to increase sharply in the second half of the year. Intel also said its lower-heat, lower-energy 0.13 micron chip would be available then.
Joseph A. Osha, director of securities research at Merrill Lynch, said Intel was trying to perform a balancing act. As its core business of desktop computer products slows, he said, Intel is pressing more urgently into chip products for faster-growing businesses like mobile and server systems. "In the context of that challenge, they are doing as good a job as can be done," Mr. Osha said. "They have handled the downturn as well as anyone in the industry."
Intel executives also said they had no plans to slow their pace of acquisitions. Intel bought 16 companies last year, at a total cost of $2.7 billion. With smaller companies running out of money, Intel's ability to buy has only increased. "Cash is king," Mr. Barrett said in an interview on Monday night. "We have cash."
Intel will use some of that cash to help Samsung Electronics of South Korea, a maker of memory chip sets, increase production of the Rambus dynamic random access memory, or D-RAM. These chip sets support Intel's semiconductors. Intel said it was offering financial assistance to Samsung, but would not say how much or disclose other terms. 
Mr. Otellini said Intel expects no shortages of D-RAM's as it increases production of the Pentium 4.

ALLSTATE PLANS ONLINE SALES

BYLINE:  By Joseph B. Treaster 

 BODY:
 The No. 1 auto insurer, State Farm, tried it. Now, No. 2, Allstate, is having a go at selling policies through one of the first online markets for insurance, a California site called InsWeb. 
And this time, analysts say that they think the chances for success are good. "State Farm couldn't make money with InsWeb," said Todd Eyler, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, "but Allstate's agents are much more Internet friendly and enabled." InsWeb distinguishes itself by providing customers with comparative prices for insurance from several companies. But customers who wanted to buy from State Farm had to contact the insurer and then wait, often to no avail, for an agent to reply by telephone or an e-mail message. Allstate says that it will send a quote via an e-mail message within 30 seconds, along with a toll-free phone number to call to complete the purchase of a policy. Joseph B. Treaster

HEADLINE: Bush Promises Colombia Help on Trade but Refuses Peace Role 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
In his first meeting with President Andres Pastrana of Colombia, President Bush agreed today to press for expanding trade preferences to Colombia, but refused a request to take part in peace talks with leftist guerrillas, officials said.
 Mr. Bush told Mr. Pastrana that he would work with lawmakers to renew the Andean Trade Preference Act, a decade-old accord that expires in December, and seek to increase the categories of Colombian goods that may enter the American market under reduced tariffs, a senior official told reporters after the meeting. 
 But Mr. Bush declined to take part in peace negotiations between the Pastrana government and Marxist rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, which has battled the Colombian state for four decades. Both Mr. Pastrana and FARC leaders last week invited the United States and Cuba to join a group of nations assisting in the on-again-off-again talks, which resume in March.
"This is an issue that the Colombian people and the Colombian president can deal with," said Mr. Bush, who appeared for brief remarks with Mr. Pastrana at his side. "We'll be glad to help Colombia in any way to make the peace. We'll be glad to help the Colombian economy through trade. But I won't be present for the discussions."
Mr. Bush was effusive in his praise for Mr. Pastrana, whose ambitious strategy to pacify the nation, promote development and curb drugtrafficking has been underwritten in part with $1.3 billion in mostly military aid from the United States. Mr. Bush has endorsed Plan Colombia -- a holdover from the Clinton administration -- but has discussed the need for limits on the extent of American involvement in Colombia and ruled out the use of American combat troops there.
"President Pastrana is a courageous leader who is dealing with very difficult problems," Mr. Bush said. "I am confident that with his leadership his nation will be better off."
In an interview this week, Mr. Pastrana asserted that his nation had "turned a corner" in several key areas. He cited the FARC's agreement to resume peace talks, the American-supported eradication of 75,000 acres of coca in two months in the drug-growing regions of Putumayo and Caqueta, and four quarters of growth in an economy struggling to emerge from its worst recession in history.
Despite that progress, Colombia experts and some lawmakers sounded a skeptical note. There will be no fast resolution to Colombia's problems, they said, citing, among other things, the need to establish the rule of law and to rein in paramilitary and security forces, which were harshly criticized by the State Department's human rights bureau this week.
"The jury's still out as to whether these are going to lead to sustained improvements in bringing the country to peace and greater control," said Michael Shifter, a senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, a forum for hemispheric leaders.
Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who returned from a visit to Colombia earlier this month, called on the administration to chart a plan that addresses how long the American-backed effort will take and how much it will cost.
"I think I made the right decision when when we voted for this assistance," Mr. McCain said. "Not because of any wild enthusiasm, but because I believe there is no alternative."

HEADLINE: 3 New Reports Show Evidence Of Weakness In the Economy 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
As the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, prepared to testify before Congress today about the nation's economy, three reports offered new, if murky, evidence yesterday of economic weakness.
 Consumer confidence, which Mr. Greenspan has called a key measure for the coming months, fell in February for the fifth consecutive month, according to the Conference Board. Americans sharply slowed the pace at which they bought new homes in January, the Census Bureau said. And spending by consumers and businesses on large, long-lasting items fell last month, although the decline was largely limited to the purchase of cars and airplanes, the Commerce Department said. 
 Investors took the new statistics as evidence that the Federal Reserve was likely to cut its benchmark interest rate for overnight bank loans either at its March 20 meeting or even before. Bond prices rose, and traders pushed short-term interest rates to their lowest level since 1998. But all the major stock indexes declined, partly because the Fed did not respond immediately to yesterday's reports, analysts said.
Trying to stave off the first recession since 1991, the Fed has twice lowered its benchmark rate by a half-point this year, on Jan. 3, between regular meetings, and on Jan. 31. The rate, which directly affects many credit card rates and small-business and car loans, is now 5.5 percent. 
Despite the bond market's rally, the new economic data offered enough conflicting signals to add to analysts' confusion about whether the economy is headed for, or even already in, a recession.
The consumer confidence index, calculated from a written questionnaire sent to 5,000 households each month, fell in February to 107, still higher than it was for the first half of the 1990's boom, according to the Conference Board. Consumers continue to say that the current economic situation remains relatively good, but their expectations for the coming six months have reached an eight-year low. As a result, the overall index has dropped almost 25 percent in just six months, a plunge usually seen only during a recession. 
The Conference Board's report was largely consistent with the initial February findings of the University of Michigan, which conducts a monthly telephone poll and released its results Feb. 16. The Michigan survey also showed a sharp decline in people's expectations, although not as steep a decline as the Conference Board reported.
"There's no denying the economy is decelerating," said Mark Vitner, an economist at First Union Bank in Charlotte, N.C. "The debate is about whether the level of consumer confidence or the decline in consumer confidence is more important."
"It's a real perplexing time," Mr. Vitner said.
After an unexpectedly slow holiday season, retail sales picked up somewhat in January, when fewer major storms hit the United States than had in December. Large chains like Sears and Target, as well as American automakers, reported stronger sales than they had anticipated based on the poor final weeks of 2000.
That moderate strength has caused many economists to question whether the drop in consumer confidence was simply a blip that is likely to reverse soon, or whether it was foretelling a sharp fall in spending later this year.
During a speech in New York yesterday, Roger W. Ferguson, the vice chairman of the Fed, said, "Despite the sharp weakening in sentiment, household spending appears thus far to have held up well," according to a transcript released by the Fed.
The divergence between confidence and spending is "somewhat puzzling," Mr. Ferguson said, and it presents a challenge for policy makers.
Analysts have attributed the rapid decline in confidence to a number of factors, including the steep fall in many technology stocks, the rash of recent layoff announcements and the degree to which the Bush administration has emphasized the economy's weaknesses, partly to build support for its tax cut proposal. In February, the Conference Board's index of future expectations fell to 69, down from 116 in September. 
At the same time, though, the index measuring people's current feelings is 164, only 10 percent lower than it was in the summer of 2000 and still higher than in 1996 and 1997, when the economy was growing rapidly. 
"The individual components are telling two different stories," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. "Only the expectations component is signaling a recession."
In part, the strength of the other component reflects an unemployment rate that remains near a 30-year low, because many of the announced layoffs have occurred overseas and the creation of jobs in the service sector has more than kept pace with cuts in manufacturing, economists say.
But the decline in the purchase of new homes suggests that people's worries may be starting to hurt one of the few areas of the economy that remained strong through December. Sales of new homes fell 10.9 percent in January, the Census Bureau reported yesterday.
Analysts noted, however, that home sales remained historically robust.
In addition to the January data, the Commerce Department released revised numbers yesterday for the final three months of 2000, showing more home sales for that period than earlier reports had and making January's numbers look weaker than they otherwise would have. 
"The absolute level of sales is still incredibly strong," Mr. Vitner of First Union said.
On Monday, the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes fell 7 percent in January to their lowest level in a year.
Home sales statistics often change significantly from one month to the next, and winter data is among the least reliable because most people buy homes in warmer months.
Also yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods fell 6 percent in January, to their lowest level since mid-1999. Excluding military industry goods and other aircraft, however, orders rose 6.5 percent, after having fallen at an annual rate of 16 percent during the final quarter of last year.
"It looks like the trend is showing signs of bottoming," said Jay Feldman, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. Still, he added, "There really is something for everybody in the durable goods data."
Mr. Greenspan gets his chance to comment on it today.

HEADLINE: General Powell in the Middle East 

 BODY:
Colin Powell made a deft diplomatic debut on his just-completed six-nation trip to the Mideast, his first overseas journey as secretary of state. He listened attentively to regional leaders, built Arab support for a plan to refine and reinvigorate sanctions against Iraq, and even won a promise from Syria's truculent president, Bashar al-Assad, to send revenues from a recently reopened oil pipeline to an internationally monitored account instead of letting them go to Saddam Hussein.
 Some Bush administration officials have favored a more assertive approach to Iraq, built around American arms aid to Iraqi opposition groups. No one disputes that most of Washington's problems with Baghdad flow from Mr. Hussein's aggressive military ambitions. But Iraq's fragmented opposition has no realistic chance of ousting him. Rebuilding support for sanctions is the most effective way to keep Baghdad from reconstituting its arsenal of unconventional weapons. 
 The plan General Powell promoted concentrates on blocking Iraqi imports of arms and materials that can be used to make them. It would be enforced by tightening United Nations control over Iraqi oil revenues. Some oil money, like the proceeds from the Syrian pipeline, currently evades U.N. monitoring. In return for plugging these financial leaks, General Powell offered Arab leaders an easing of non-military sanctions and a more flexible approach to items that serve essential civilian needs, like refrigerated trucks and water pumps. If Washington can build a consensus around this approach before next month's Arab League summit meeting in Jordan, and President Assad follows through on his pipeline pledge, it may be possible to cut off most of the $2 billion a year in unmonitored oil money now reaching Baghdad.
General Powell also moved nimbly through his meetings with Israel's prime minister-elect, Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat. He wisely played down an earlier State Department call for Israel to transfer tax revenues owed to Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Authority and instead emphasized easing travel and work restrictions on Palestinian civilians. Israel is more likely to move on humanitarian measures like this than to ease financial pressures on the Palestinian leadership.
For many of his Arab hosts, General Powell was already a familiar and admired figure from his days as the overall commander of American forces during the Persian Gulf war. But he gained new credit from his unpretentious diplomatic style and his recognition of growing Arab impatience with the suffering sanctions have brought to Iraqi civilians. 
Much hard work lies ahead for General Powell in the Middle East as he works to rebuild a regional coalition against Saddam Hussein, end the violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and revive Israeli peace efforts with the Palestinians and Syria. But he is off to an impressive start.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET: THE ISSUES; 
Bush Underlines Pledge About Social Security

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
President Bush made good tonight on his campaign promise to push for the creation of personal investment accounts within Social Security, telling Congress that encouraging workers to buy stocks and bonds is the best way to deal with the looming financial strains on the retirement system.
 But as he did in the campaign, Mr. Bush avoided any details about how his proposal would be carried out, including the likelihood that any overhaul of Social Security would include politically painful benefit cuts. 
 And to ensure that the issue did not complicate his push this year for a big tax cut, Mr. Bush promised only to establish a commission that would work out the specifics and report back to him in six months. Under that timetable, Congress would not be likely to take up legislation before next year. 
"Seven years from now the baby boom generation will begin to claim Social Security benefits," Mr. Bush said. "Everyone in this chamber knows Social Security is not prepared to fully fund their retirement. And we have only a couple of years to get prepared."
On Medicare, Mr. Bush's nationally televised speech to a joint session of Congress reiterated his general commitment to overhauling the program, which like Social Security will run into financial problems as the population ages. But it also highlighted his willingness to leave to Congress, at least for now, the details of the politically tricky issue and the associated topic of insurance coverage for prescription drugs.
"Clearly, the president's priorities right now are education and tax relief," Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, said before the speech. 
To some degree, Mr. Bush's election shattered the long-held assumption in both parties that proposing major changes to Social Security was political suicide. 
But, as Al Gore repeatedly pointed out during the campaign, Mr. Bush presented his plan as all gain and no pain, sidestepping the debate over whether restoring Social Security's health would require steps like cutting the guaranteed benefit, reducing cost of living increases for beneficiaries or raising the retirement age.
Mr. Bush also remained quiet during the campaign, and again tonight, on how the government would pay for the creation of the private accounts. Analysts put the cost at $1 trillion over the next decade.
Mr. Bush told members of Congress today that he had not yet settled on the Social Security commission's members, and White House officials said the commission would not be up and running before spring. In the past, Mr. Bush has indicated that he would like to appoint members from both parties who support private accounts.
Some Democrats said the commission was a stalling tactic and a way for Mr. Bush to distance himself from any difficult decisions.
"I think history tells us that commissions ultimately do very little to solve problems that are contentious and difficult," said Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a Democrat who led an unsuccessful bipartisan commission on Medicare reform. 
If no changes are made to the system, Social Security will run into financial trouble in coming decades. 
Under current projections, Social Security will take in less through payroll taxes than it pays out in benefits starting in 2015, about the time the baby boom generation is retiring in large numbers. By around 2037, the system will have redeemed its store of government bonds, and after that would be able to pay only about 70 percent of promised benefits.
Some economists, including Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, say that improvements in the economy's long-term growth potential could further delay or even eliminate the problem. Social Security's trustees are scheduled to update their projections in about a month.
But for now there is general consensus among members of both parties that it would be prudent to act as soon as possible to assure Social Security's health. 
There is no consensus, however about how to do so. And it is unclear whether Mr. Bush will be able to persuade Congress to go along with a sweeping change to a program that Democrats consider to be the cornerstone of the social welfare system and perhaps their party's greatest accomplishment.
By agreement of the two parties, the projected surplus in Social Security funds -- about $2.5 trillion of a total federal surplus of $5.6 trillion over the next 10 years -- could not be used for tax cuts or new spending.
As a practical matter, that has meant the Social Security surplus would be used to reduce the national debt. But in his budget plan, Mr. Bush will use only about $2 trillion for debt reduction, saying the debt left after that point would be difficult or impossible to redeem in the next decade. As a result, his plan would leave aside $500 billion to $600 billion in excess Social Security revenues that administration officials said could logically be used to help pay for private accounts.
But Democrats attacked Mr. Bush's budget today, even before its details were released, saying the president was in essence raiding Social Security's trust funds in violation of the agreement to use the surplus for debt reduction. They also criticized Mr. Bush for not pledging to use the surplus being generated by Medicare -- $400 billion over 10 years -- for debt reduction. 
"I think there is a budget shell game going on," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader in the Senate. 
On Medicare, the new administration's more cautious approach contrasts with the ambitious "fast-track" schedule for Medicare legislation that Mr. Bush outlined during the campaign: immediate short term legislation to help with prescription drugs for low-income elderly and a task force that produced legislation for a complete overhaul of the program by September.
Besides the administration's decision to focus on tax cuts and education, there is another factor: Lawmakers in both parties have been decidedly cool to the administration's short-term proposal to help states provide some immediate prescription drug coverage to poor retirees. And leaders of the Senate Finance Committee indicated his idea for longer-term restructuring would not be the basis for their work.

HEADLINE: A Victory for Cleaner Air 

 BODY:
To the delight of environmentalists and the dismay of several industries, the Supreme Court unanimously reaffirmed the bedrock principles of the Clean Air Act yesterday, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to enforce that act with detailed regulations. The decision vindicated the clean air strategy devised by the outgoing E.P.A. administrator, Carol Browner, and challenged her successor, Christie Whitman, to move forward with a program to achieve the clean air targets set by Ms. Browner.
 The court confronted two main issues. The first was a 1999 decision by a three-judge federal appeals panel that had invalidated tough new air quality standards imposed by Ms. Browner to force major reductions in the amount of ozone and soot in the air. The appeals panel, reviving a discredited constitutional theory known as the non-delegation doctrine, ruled that Congress had improperly delegated its legislative authority to the E.P.A. In his opinion for the Supreme Court yesterday, Justice Antonin Scalia briskly disposed of this argument by asserting that the delegation of authority had been no greater than delegations to other administrative agencies that the court had upheld over the years. 
 The second and more important issue was the argument advanced by a coalition of industry groups that the E.P.A. administrator should have taken economic factors -- costs and benefits -- into account in setting the new air quality standards. This went to the very heart of the Clean Air Act. As written in 1970, and interpreted in several lower court decisions over the years, the act imposed one overriding obligation on the administrator -- to protect the public health "with an adequate margin of safety."
To the extent the act mentioned costs and benefits at all, it allowed the administrator the discretion to take them into account when setting timetables and figuring the best ways to reach the standards. But it made clear that only science, not costs, could shape the standards themselves. Here again, Justice Scalia was clear. The act, he said, "unambiguously bars cost considerations." 
The decision should encourage Mrs. Whitman to proceed with strategies devised by her predecessor to help all areas of the country move into compliance. As governor of New Jersey, Mrs. Whitman embraced these programs with enthusiasm, including Ms. Browner's hugely controversial regulations requiring cleaner diesel fuel. The campaign now under way by refiners and other industries to weaken these rules will pose an early test of Mrs. Whitman's resolve.

HEADLINE: THE WEB IN TOUGHER TIMES; 
Now That We're Still Here, Where Do We Go? 7 Answers

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
HUNDREDS of millions of people surf the Web, hundreds of billions of dollars of stock market value have come and gone, and yet the burning questions posed by the Internet have cycled back to the same ones asked five years ago, when people first started to size up the Internet.
 Can anyone make money with this? Will it be a viable medium for advertising? For shopping? Where is this all going, anyway? 
 Two years ago, it seemed as if there were answers to these questions. But there is nothing like a plunging stock market and a generation of pioneering companies teetering on collapse to sow new doubts.
To try to figure out what we have learned from the wild ride so far, this section convened a panel of seven people who have been taking chances through the ups and downs of the Internet: 
* Patrick Byrne, the chief executive of Overstock.com, a rapidly growing site that sells surplus merchandise, much of it bought from failed e-tailers.
* Bill Gross, the chief executive of Idealab, which spawned companies ranging from CitySearch to Goto.com to eToys.
* Vincent Caminiti, the senior vice president for e-business at Delta Air Lines.
* Mark T. Hogan, the president of the e-GM unit of General Motors. 
* Ted Leonsis, the vice chairman and new products officer of the America Online unit of AOL Time Warner.
* Roger McNamee, the general partner of Integral Capital Partners and Silver Lake Partners, two private investment firms that focus on technology companies.
* Stephen Riggio, the vice chairman of Barnes & Noble and the acting chief executive of Barnesandnoble.com.
Earlier this month, the panel exchanged e-mail messages over one week. 
The full text of the discussion appears on The New York Times on the Web at www.nytimes.com/ebusiness. Following are excerpts from the discussion.
Q. A year ago, companies that had anything to do with the Internet -- media, commerce, business to business, infrastructure -- were valued at hundreds of millions, often billions, of dollars. Today, most are worth fractions of those sums. Other than the market itself, has anything else changed?
VINCENT CAMINITI -- The travel industry still sees an aggressive movement toward online distribution. At Delta, we are extremely bullish on how the Internet and associated technologies will continue to drive significant value to our company. For example, we expect our Web site to double its sales activity to 5 million tickets versus 2.5 million in 2000. These initiatives, combined with others, will result in driving over 20 percent of our tickets purchased online, representing over $2 billion in revenue.
BILL GROSS -- The Internet allows for unbelievably amazing business creation and also for incredibly dumb business creation. Over the past several years, some bad businesses were launched as people experimented to learn the differences between great, mediocre and bad business propositions online. 
We believe that three powerful things that Internet business "can" have (that is, they do not have to have it, but they can be constructed to exploit these) are high gross margins, tight feedback loops with customers and strong barriers to entry via network and other effects. Most online businesses do not exploit these, and if they don't, then they are just ordinary, if not worse, businesses.
PATRICK BYRNE -- First, people were deluding themselves into thinking the Internet was good at things it is not good at, and second, a pyramid-scheme swindle was occurring. What has changed is that it has become clear that the Internet is not good at most things, and the pyramid-scheme ran out of new suckers. 
MARK T. HOGAN -- Over the last year, e-GM has been in a launch-and-learn mode to better gauge what will connect with consumers and what won't. We've been successful in focusing our e-business programs and are seeing positive, bottom-line results.
ROGER McNAMEE -- The market is the biggest change from a year ago. We are coming off one of the largest manias in American history, and the hangover is likely to be with us for some time. This process of mania and cleansing is both normal and healthy. As is so often the case after a mania collapses, the conventional wisdom seems to be that the Internet was little more than an illusion created by venture capitalists, investment bankers and 20-something entrepreneurs for their mutual profit. Wrong. Once the noise dies down, it will be possible to analyze what the Internet has produced to date, and I suspect the numbers will be very impressive.
MR. BYRNE -- I disagree with Roger in his dismissal of the Internet mania as part of a "normal and healthy" cycle wherein people tested new business models in the laboratory of our economy and weaker models died out. In fact, "other people's money" funded many businesses that any sophomore economics student could have explained were intrinsically doomed. Not all manias are, like Dutch tulips, psychological in origin. Some manias are swindles. 
MR. McNAMEE -- I don't mean to come across as Pollyanna here, but I disagree with the notion that there was a conscious malfeasance at the heart of Internet mania. The mania built up slowly and steadily over a period of five years as ever smaller increases in economic value created ever larger paper profits, reducing the fear of ever larger percentages of our population. Just as with tulip mania, the driving force was self-delusion, not criminality. This is not to say that there was no cynical behavior in the investment business. There was. Lots. Fortunately the market has its own mechanisms for dealing with such behavior.
MR. BYRNE -- A year ago I spent two months meeting with venture capitalists, none of whom are in this group. I am an investor by background, and my sympathies are more with capital than with visionaries. Yet I received term sheets that were an embarrassment to capitalism. They read, in essence, "I'll put in $30 million with you but you have to promise to triple it (and if you don't, it comes out of your hide, Byrne)." That, to me, is not yous-knows-da-game-yous-takes-your-chances capitalism. It is crybaby investing. 
TED LEONSIS -- Don't confuse what Wall Street says and does with what consumers say and do. Consumers are voting with their money -- and with their time. And in a big way. Wall Street wanted every company to scale to size, and that was never going to happen because as you look at other markets and categories, you will find one to three leading players in each segment with other niche performers trailing far behind. As this first wave of investor frenzy cools, the big will get bigger and the small will get marginalized. 
MR. McNAMEE -- With all due respect to my fellow panelists, I don't think the Internet's future has anything to do with the "big sites." To me, the Internet is not a place. It's a communications platform that touches everyone and everything in our economy. I believe that AOL and eBay have brilliant prospects for the future, but they represent no more than the tip of the iceberg.
The real power of the Internet lies in its ubiquity and simplicity. It has the ability to permeate and catalyze our economy in a manner comparable to the interstate highway system or to the railroads.
MR. GROSS -- I agree with you, Roger, completely, and would add to ubiquity and simplicity -- openness. It is this openness that allows an entrepreneur in a college dorm to invent something new that can touch many people. Compare it to the industrial revolution. If you had an innovation that was huge and bold, and even if you could patent it, it was still a long haul before you could impact 1,000 people with that innovation, let alone a million. Now you can impact a million people in a month, if not a day.
Q. What mistakes have you made and learned from that have helped you improve your own online business? What have you learned by watching the mistakes of others?
MR. CAMINITI -- Some traditional companies have elected to form a separate e-subsidiary, setting up new compensation plans, tracking stocks and removing themselves from their core business. This is problematic as the "hidden" assets are owned by the core, require functional areas' participation and are therefore integral to the online success. 
STEPHEN RIGGIO -- Like most companies that jumped into e-commerce aggressively, we believed that the Internet itself, from a purely transaction perspective, computer to computer, would be an extremely efficient way to process customer orders. The higher-than-expected costs come before and after the order is created, and this has nothing to do with marketing. The Internet has given our customers the controls as well as a voice, and they certainly use it. The curse is the huge costs associated with handling the enormous volume of phone calls (yes, they call) and e-mails.
What e-commerce, and catalog mail order, for that matter, is missing is a "store manager" level of responsibility, authority and accountability. In a retail store, the buck stops with the store manager. They are the most important people at Barnes & Noble. While feedback loops are important, they don't get close enough to the customer. 
MR. McNAMEE -- Very little new has been learned. Most of the lessons of this mania have their roots on tablets handed down from on high in some distant epoch. Examples:
* Cash is king. (Corollary: the difference between a business and a business plan is capital.)
* Profits matter.
* Stories that appear too good to be true usually are.
MR. LEONSIS -- I thought, back in 1994, that people could be entertained online. We experimented and failed. What I learned was that people wanted to plan their entertainment online. So we oriented our local group -- Digital Cities, Moviefone and Mapquest -- to this consumer need. 
MR. BYRNE -- Outsourcing mission critical operations to experienced third parties can lead to ruin: when things are going wrong, they don't lose enough sleep. We have products that vary in size from watches to big-screen TV's, which are rolled over constantly (the average closeout buy is 60 units) and which have to be sold from a pick-pack-and-ship facility. After dealing with two well-known third-party warehouses, both of whom failed miserably, we realized no one knew how to do this.
Q. Several of you are skeptical of the value of online advertising. Is there any future for advertising-supported sites?
MR. RIGGIO -- Ad revenues will be a fraction of what they were at their peak. This will cause companies with no cash to disappear by the thousands -- we haven't seen anything yet. And it will compel companies who have principally depended on online advertising to generate new forms of revenue.
MR. GROSS -- Writing off advertising as a model is ludicrous. Maybe ill-formed businesses based on advertising, but not all advertising. Advertising -- or the education-shifting of consumers and businesses to make purchase decisions -- is huge. Because of the two-way nature and trackability of the Internet, a whole new era of advertising, including pay for performance, cost per action, etc., can be created and can have enormous implications.
MR. RIGGIO -- I did not mean to suggest that we should write off advertising. I do believe that the so-called ad revenue that supported most sites would drop substantially, causing many of them to disappear. Of course, this opinion is based mostly on my experiences on the paying side. Online media is a valuable channel. It has just been tremendously overpriced.
Q. The Internet was put forward as the cyberslingshot that a David could use to topple the Goliaths of the Fortune 500. Middlemen were cut out, prices slashed, customers empowered with new information. With so many David.coms gone, how much will the Goliaths change?
MR. RIGGIO -- The whole idea of disintermediation was ridiculous to begin with. The Internet is a vehicle to create, not destroy (unless we are talking about the trillions of dollars of market cap that has gone down the tubes) and it will create value in the hands of good companies. 
MR. LEONSIS -- Disintermediation was going to kill AOL, too, remember? All I can say is that still, in 2001, the best-selling meal in America is Happy Meal No. 1. Consumers want packaged offerings -- easy to find, high quality and fairly priced value.
MR. CAMINITI -- Does anyone not believe the Internet has changed the way we do business dramatically and forever? Power to the people and power to business. Customers shopping Delta now have all the information (power) they need to make more informed decisions, and they are in control. We, on the other hand, can make meaningful, more personal offers, designed to not only provide value to the customer but do it more profitably (avoiding middlemen). 
MR. McNAMEE -- It is instructive to study the industries that have been transformed. In the retail brokerage industry, the Web removed the human element from an error-prone process, creating a nirvana with both increased customer satisfaction and lower cost to the service provider. Any industry that can replicate this cost-benefit combination will be transformed in a big way.
MR. LEONSIS -- I am concerned that many of the old economy companies that were late to transform their business via the Internet have now been given tacit permission to avoid change by the slew of media hype about the so-called dot-com mania fizzle. It reminds me of the tsunami in Japan where the water ran out of the bay -- and all the townspeople slowly walked into the beach area, unafraid, and then the wave came back and killed them all.
Q. The hype about B-to-B has been at times as frenzied as e-commerce and e-media. Again, let's look at what's real, in your shops and in the world. Where do you see Internet technology changing how companies buy raw materials and sell their products?
MR. CAMINITI -- The Internet and its B-to-B exchanges have brought buyers and sellers to the table who would never have readily sat down before. Sitting on the sidelines and not getting involved at this time is not an option for Delta. By not joining an exchange, we run the risk of losing control over how the marketplace develops and of being shut out of leading-edge technology, not to mention potential new equity opportunities.
MR. BYRNE -- The hype about B-to-B is not hype. The difference between B-to-C and B-to-B is that it proved extremely difficult to get consumers to change their patterns of behavior. But business people cannot accept such costs, and so they quickly change behaviors to acquire advantages, like reducing transaction costs or maximizing yield.
MR. McNAMEE -- While all the early B-to-B buzz related to purchasing applications, that is not where the real value lies. Most companies do a decent job of purchasing, and some can enhance price and vendor discovery through Net markets. The big win, however, is in the management of multistep supply chains. Why? Because the winners in technology are the companies which can get new products to market (in volume) fastest, thereby capturing the easy profits and market share.
Q. So, what is at the top of your list of things to do in your shop this year, and what will have the most impact?
MR. CAMINITI -- We'll move toward our goal of migrating customers from offline purchasing channels to online channels, achieving more than 20 percent of online share and more than $1 billion of annual ticket sales via Delta.com. The future is extremely wide and bright for "business-to-employee connections," and therefore critical that we bring our employee force along for the e-ride.
MR. RIGGIO -- In 2001, we will execute our vision of uniting our retail stores and Web site. By mid-2001, every single Barnes & Noble store will have Internet Service Counters, enabling customers to place orders from titles and products listed on our Web site right in the store. 
MR. LEONSIS -- Take immediate advantage of true synergies between AOL and Time Warner, and drive more cost efficiencies into the company. Cut costs through cross promotion and shared infrastructure and beat Wall Street's expectations on all metrics. Begin to transform selected industries and our businesses via the Internet with a focus on music, television, publishing and telephony. 
Q. Now, for the crystal ball. Here's where you get to make predictions about a significant occurrence in any corner of the world related to the Net.
MR. McNAMEE -- I believe the next two or three years will be a period of consolidation. To the casual observer, it will appear that the Net is receding in importance. In reality, the Web platform will be bulking up in preparation for the next big wave of growth. 
The Internet eliminates barriers of distance, time and even politics. Already a powerful force for globalization, the Internet projects American ideas and values better than Hollywood ever did. 
MR. LEONSIS -- The telephone is the single-most-used device known to man -- and it will be a big new gateway to the Web. Bandwidth increases will roll out slower than people think. 
MR. BYRNE -- The largest organization to be disintermediated is government. Thinking out over a decade or two, I suspect that as the justification for many of government's activities are eroded by the Internet, there will be less of them, and more discretion will return to individuals.

HEADLINE: Europe Sets Examination Of G.E. Deal 

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER with CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
The European Commission confirmed today that it would open an extended investigation into the General Electric Company's planned $45 billion acquisition of Honeywell International Inc., despite an 11th-hour effort by John F. Welch Jr., the G.E. chief executive, to secure a quick clearance by European regulators.
 "I informed Jack Welch of my intention to open a second-phase inquiry," Mario Monti, the competition commissioner, said in reference to his meeting with Mr. Welch in Brussels on Monday. 
 A second-phase investigation by the commission lasts as long as four months, making it impossible for the deal to close by the end of March, as originally planned. "We obviously expected a more timely resolution," General Electric said in a statement Monday evening. 
A full inquiry is certainly a disappointment for Mr. Welch. He maintains that there is little overlap between Honeywell's and General Electric's customers, but he notes that European officials are more concerned that competitors are uncomfortable with the prospect of facing a new behemoth.
"Regulators in the U.S. worry most about the impact of a deal like this on customers, but in Europe they put a lot more weight on competitor's complaints and worries," Mr. Welch said in a telephone interview today. "By logic, they should green- light this deal, but who knows what political issues will get involved."
Some European competitors in aerospace and the airline industry have expressed concerns about the deal. 
Still, analysts in Europe say the commission is worried chiefly about potential overlap in the manufacture of small-aircraft engines used on business and regional jets and helicopter engines. They also point to the potential combined strength of General Electric and Honeywell in repair and overhaul services.
Both companies make aircraft engines, with Honeywell also specializing in making avionic equipment for cockpits. One likely outcome of the deal would be greater integration of each company's products.
The European Commission approved the merger of AlliedSignal and Honeywell in 1999, but only after the companies agreed not to bundle avionics and nonavionics products. 
And there is the deal's sheer size. Noting that General Electric already has half of the global aircraft engine market, an analyst in London said that with the acquisition of Honeywell's avionics business, "General Electric will soon make more of a Boeing aircraft than Boeing does."
Mr. Welch has a personal stake in the outcome of the Honeywell deal. Originally set to retire in April, he agreed to stay on as G.E. chairman until the end of this year, to help integrate Honeywell.
If the deal does fall through, would he leave sooner? "I might stick around for an hour or two to say goodbye," he said, laughing. But then, in a more serious voice, he added: "I'm not going to stay a day longer than I think I should. So, yes, depending on how this unfolds, I might be out of here sooner rather than later."
Even if the European regulators ultimately approve the deal, four months can be an expensive delay. Mr. Welch contends that G.E. can wrest double-digit earnings benefits in the first full year of the merger, and investors have been counting on that. "Honeywell really does have great assets, and you'll be surprised at what G.E. can do with them, once they are in the G.E. culture and the head chopping is done," said Timothy M. Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager of the Dreyfus Corporation, which owns G.E. stock. 
But the cost-cutting clock was supposed to start ticking in March. 
"The delay is a modest negative," Michael T. Regan, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, said. "We expect that Honeywell's businesses are feeling the impact of the current economic slowdown and the sooner G.E. can begin the integration process the better." 
The European investigation, as well as an inquiry by the Justice Department, also raises questions of how much of Honeywell General Electric will get a chance to integrate. While Mr. Welch expects that he will be asked only to make "insignificant" divestitures, if any, most analysts expect the company will be forced to sell large parts of its avionics businesses.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET; 
Transcript of President Bush's Message to Congress on His Budget Proposal

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President George W. Bush's message to Congress last night, as recorded by The New York Times: 
 Thank you. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress: It's a great privilege to be here to outline a new budget and a new approach for governing our great country. I thank you for your invitation to speak here tonight. I know Congress had to formally invite me. And it could have been a close vote. So, Mr. Vice President, I appreciate you being here to break the tie. I want to thank so many of you who have accepted my invitation to come to the White House to discuss important issues. We're off to a good start. I will continue to meet with you and ask for your input. You have been kind and candid, and I thank you for making a new president feel welcome. 
 The last time I visited the Capitol, I came to take an oath. On the steps of this building, I pledged to honor our Constitution and laws, and I asked you to join me in setting a tone of civility and respect in Washington. I hope America is noticing the difference. Because we're making progress. Together, we are changing the tone in the nation's capital. And this spirit of respect and cooperation is vital, because in the end, we will be judged not only by what we say or how we say it, we will be judged by what we are able to accomplish.
America today is a nation with great challenges, but greater resources. An artist using statistics as a brush could paint two very different pictures of our country. One would have warning signs: increasing layoffs, rising energy prices, too many failing schools, persistent poverty, the stubborn vestiges of racism. Another picture would be full of blessings: a balanced budget, big surpluses, a military that is second to none, a country at peace with its neighbors, technology that is revolutionizing the world, and our greatest strength, concerned citizens who care for our country and care for each other.
Neither picture is complete in and of itself. And tonight I challenge and invite Congress to work with me to use the resources of one picture to repaint the other, to direct the advantages of our time to solve the problems of our people. Some of these resources will come from government -- some, but not all. Year after year in Washington, budget debates seem to come down to an old, tired argument: on one side, those who want more government, regardless of the cost; on the other, those who want less government, regardless of the need.
We should leave those arguments to the last century and chart a different course. Government has a role, and an important role. Yet too much government crowds out initiative and hard work, private charity and the private economy. Our new governing vision says government should be active, but limited, engaged, but not overbearing. 
And my budget is based on that philosophy. It is reasonable and it is responsible. It meets our obligations and funds our growing needs. We increase spending next year for Social Security and Medicare and other entitlement programs by $81 billion. We've increased spending for discretionary programs by a very responsible 4 percent, above the rate of inflation. My plan pays down an unprecedented amount of our national debt, and then when money is still left over, my plan returns it to the people who earned it in the first place. 
A budget's impact is counted in dollars but measured in lives. Excellent schools, quality health care, a secure retirement, a cleaner environment, a stronger defense -- these are all important needs and we fund them.
The highest percentage increase in our budget should go to our children's education. Education is not my top priority -- education is my top priority and by supporting this budget, you'll make it yours as well. 
Reading is the foundation of all learning, so during the next 5 years, we triple spending, adding $5 billion to help every child in America learn to read. Values are important, so we've tripled funding for character education to teach our children not only reading and writing, but right from wrong. We've increased funding to train and recruit teachers, because we know a good education starts with a good teacher. And I have a wonderful partner in this effort. I like teachers so much, I married one. 
Laura has begun a new effort to recruit Americans to the profession that will shape our future: teaching. She will travel across America, to promote sound teaching practices and early reading skills in our schools and in programs such as Head Start.
When it comes to our schools, dollars alone do not always make the difference. Funding is important, and so is reform. 
So we must tie funding to higher standards and accountability for results. I believe in local control of schools: we should not and we will not run our public schools from Washington, D.C. Yet when the federal government spends tax dollars, we must insist on results. Children should be tested on basic reading and math skills every year, between grades three and eight. Measuring is the only way to know whether all our children are learning -- and I want to know, because I refuse to leave any child behind in America. Critics of testing contend it distracts from learning. 
They talk about "teaching to the test." But let's put that logic to the test. If you test a child on basic math and reading skills, and you're "teaching to the test," you're teaching math and reading. And that's the whole idea.
As standards rise, local schools will need more flexibility to meet them. So we must streamline the dozens of federal education programs into five and let states spend money in those categories as they see fit. Schools will be given a reasonable chance to improve, and the support to do so. Yet if they don't, if they continue to fail, we must give parents and students different options: a better public school, a private school, tutoring, or a charter school. In the end, every child in a bad situation must be given a better choice, because when it comes to our children, failure's simply not an option.
Another priority in my budget is to keep the vital promises of Medicare and Social Security, and together we will do so. To meet the health care needs of all America's seniors, we double the Medicare budget over the next 10 years.
My budget dedicates $238 billion to Medicare next year alone, enough to fund all current programs and to begin a new prescription drug benefit for low-income seniors. No senior in America should have to choose between buying food and buying prescriptions.
To make sure the retirement savings of America's seniors are not diverted into any other program my budget protects all $2.6 trillion of the Social Security surplus for Social Security and for Social Security alone. My budget puts a priority on access to health care without telling Americans what doctor they have to see or what coverage they must choose. Many working Americans do not have health care coverage. So we will help them buy their own insurance with refundable tax credits. And to provide quality care in low-income neighborhoods, over the next five years we will double the number of people served at community health care centers.
And we will address the concerns of those who have health coverage yet worry their insurance company doesn't care and won't pay. Together, this Congress and this president will find common ground to make sure doctors make medical decisions and patients get the health care they deserve with a patients' bill of rights. When it comes to their health, people want to get the medical care they need, not be forced to go to court because they didn't get it. We will ensure access to the courts for those with legitimate claims, but first, let's put in place a strong independent review so we promote quality health care, not frivolous lawsuits.
My budget also increases funding for medical research, which gives hope to many who struggle with serious disease. Our prayers tonight are with one of your own who is engaged in his own fight against cancer, a fine representative and a good man, Congressman Joe Moakley. God bless you, Joe. I can think of no more appropriate tribute to Joe than to have the Congress finish the job of doubling the budget for the National Institutes of Health.
My New Freedom Initiative for Americans with Disabilities funds new technologies, expands opportunities to work, and makes our society more welcoming. For the more than 50 million Americans with disabilities, we must continue to break down barriers to equality. The budget I propose to you also supports the people who keep our country strong and free, the men and women who serve in the United States military. I'm requesting $5.7 billion in increased military pay and benefits, and health care and housing. Our men and women in uniform give America their best and we owe them our support. 
America's veterans honored their commitment to our country through their military service. I will honor our commitment to them with a billion dollar increase to ensure better access to quality care and faster decisions on benefit claims. 
My budget will improve our environment by accelerating the cleanup of toxic brownfields. And I propose we make a major investment in conservation by fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Our national parks have a special place in our country's life. Our parks are places of great natural beauty and history. 
As good stewards, we must leave them better than we found them, so I propose providing $4.9 billion over five years for the upkeep of these national treasures. And my budget adopts a hopeful new approach to help the poor and the disadvantaged. We must encourage and support the work of charities and faith-based and community groups that offer help and love one person at time. These groups are working in every neighborhood in America, to fight homelessness and addiction and domestic violence, to provide a hot meal or a mentor or a safe haven for our children. Government should welcome these groups to apply for funds, not discriminate against them. 
Government cannot be replaced by charities or volunteers. Government should not fund religious activities. But our nation should support the good works of these good people who are helping their neighbors in need. 
So I propose allowing all taxpayers, whether they itemize or not, to deduct their charitable contributions. Estimates show this could encourage as much as 14 billion a year in new charitable giving, money that will save and change lives. Our budget provides more than $700 million over the next 10 years for a Federal Compassion Capital Fund with a focused and noble mission: to provide a mentor to the more than one million children with a parent in prison, and to support other local efforts to fight illiteracy, teen pregnancy, drug addiction, and other difficult problems.
With us tonight is the mayor of Philadelphia. Please help me welcome Mayor John Street. Mayor Street has encouraged faith-based and community organizations to make a significant difference in Philadelphia. He's invited me to his city this summer, to see compassion in action. 
I'm personally aware of just how effective the mayor is. Mayor Street's a Democrat. Let the record show I lost his city big time. But some things are bigger than politics. So I look forward to coming to your city to see your faith-based programs in action.
As government promotes compassion, it also must promote justice. Too many of our citizens have cause to doubt our nation's justice when the law points a finger of suspicion at groups, instead of individuals. All our citizens are created equal and must be treated equally. Earlier today I asked John Ashcroft, the attorney general, to develop specific recommendations to end racial profiling. It's wrong and we will end it in America. In so doing, we will not hinder the work of our nation's brave police officers. They protect us every day, often at great risk. But by stopping the abuses of a few, we will add to the public confidence our police officers earn and deserve.
My budget has funded a responsible increase in our ongoing operations, it has funded our nation's important priorities, it has protected Social Security and Medicare, and our surpluses are big enough that there is still money left over.
Many of you have talked about the need to pay down our national debt. I listened, and I agree.
We owe it to our children and grandchildren to act now, and I hope you will join me to pay down $2 trillion in debt during the next 10 years. At the end of those 10 years, we'll have paid down all the debt that is available to retire. That is more debt repaid more quickly than has ever been repaid by any nation at any time in history.
We should also prepare for the unexpected, for the uncertainties of the future. We should approach our nation's budget as any prudent family would, with a contingency fund for emergencies or additional spending needs. For example, after a strategic review, we may need to increase defense spending, we may need to increase spending for our farmers, or additional money to reform Medicare. And so my budget sets aside almost a trillion dollars over 10 years for additional needs; that is one trillion additional reasons you can feel comfortable supporting this budget.
We have increased our budget at a responsible 4 percent, we have funded our priorities, we've paid down all the available debt, we have prepared for contingencies and we still have money left over. Yogi Berra once said: "When you come to a fork in the road, take it." Now we come to a fork in the road. We have two choices. Even though we have already met our needs, we could spend the money on more and bigger government. That's the road our nation has traveled in recent years. Last year, government spending shot up 8 percent. That's far more than our economy grew, far more than personal income grew and far more than the rate of inflation. If you continue on that road, you will spend the surplus and have to dip into Social Security to pay other bills. 
Unrestrained government spending is a dangerous road to deficits, so we must take a different path. The other choice is to let the American people spend their own money to meet their own needs. I hope you'll join me in standing firmly on the side of the people. 
You see, the growing surplus exists because taxes are too high and government is charging more than it needs. The people of America have been overcharged and on their behalf, I'm here asking for a refund. Some say my tax plan is too big, others say it's too small. I respectfully disagree. This plan is just right. 
I didn't throw darts at a board to come up with a number for tax relief. I didn't take a poll, or develop an arbitrary formula that might sound good. I looked at problems in the tax code and calculated the cost to fix them.
A tax rate of 15 percent is too high for those who earned low wages, so we must lower the rate to 10 percent. No one should pay more than a third of the money they earn in Federal income taxes, so we lowered the top rate to 33 percent. This reform will be welcome relief for America's small businesses, which often pay taxes at the highest rate, and help for small business means jobs for Americans. 
We simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax rates from the current five rates to four lower ones: 10 percent, 15, 25, and 33 percent. In my plan, no one is targeted in or targeted out; everyone who pays income taxes will get relief. 
Our government should not tax, and thereby discourage, marriage, so we reduced the marriage penalty. I want to help families rear and support their children, so we doubled the child credit to $1,000 per child. It's not fair to tax the same earnings twice, once when you earn them and again when you die, so we must repeal the death tax.
These changes add up to significant help. A typical family with two children will save $1,600 a year on their federal income taxes. Now $1,600 may not sound like a lot to some, but it means a lot to many families. Sixteen hundred dollars buys gas for two cars for an entire year, it pays tuition for a year at a community college, it pays the average family grocery bill for three months. That's real money. With us tonight, representing many American families, are Steven and Josefina Ramos. They are from Pennsylvania, but they could be from any one of your districts. Steven is a network administrator for a school district, Josefina is a Spanish teacher at a charter school, and they have a 2-year-old daughter. Steven and Josefina tell me they pay almost $8,000 a year in federal income taxes; my plan will save them more than $2,000. Let me tell you what Steven says: "Two thousand dollars a year means a lot to my family. If we had this money, it would help us reach our goal of paying off our personal debt in two years time." After that, Steven and Josefina want to start saving for Lianna's college education. My attitude is, government should never stand in the way of families achieving their dreams. And as we debate this issue, always remember the surplus is not the government's money, the surplus is the people's money. 
For lower-income families, my tax relief plan restores basic fairness. Right now, complicated tax rules punish hard work. A waitress supporting two children on $25,000 a year can lose nearly half of every additional dollar she earns above the 25,000. Her overtime, her hardest hours, are taxed at nearly 50 percent. This sends a terrible message: You'll never get ahead. But America's message must be different: We must honor hard work, never punish it. 
With tax relief, overtime will no longer be overtax time for the waitress. People with the smallest incomes will get the highest percentage of reductions. And millions of additional American families will be removed from the income tax rolls entirely. 
Tax relief is right and tax relief is urgent. The long economic expansion that began almost 10 years ago is faltering. Lower interest rates will eventually help, but we cannot assume they will do the job all by themselves. 
Forty years ago and then 20 years ago, two presidents, one Democrat, one Republican, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, advocated tax cuts to, in President Kennedy's words, "get this country moving again." They knew then, what we must do now: to create economic growth and opportunity, we must put money back into the hands of the people who buy goods and create jobs. 
We must act quickly. The chairman of the Federal Reserve has testified before Congress that tax cuts often come too late to stimulate economic recovery. So I want to work with you to give our economy an important jump start by making tax relief retroactive. 
We must act now because it is the right thing to do. We must also act now because we have other things to do. We must show courage to confront and resolve tough challenges: to restructure our nation's defenses, to meet our growing need for energy, and to reform Medicare and Social Security. America has a window of opportunity to extend and secure our present peace by promoting a distinctly American internationalism. We will work with our allies and friends to be a force for good and a champion of freedom. We will work for free markets, free trade and freedom from oppression. Nations making progress toward freedom will find America is their friend. 
We will promote our values; we'll promote the peace. And we need a strong military to keep the peace. But our military was shaped to confront the challenges of the past. So I've asked the secretary of defense to review America's armed forces and prepare to transform them to meet emerging threats. My budget makes a down payment on the research and development that will be required. Yet, in our broader transformation effort, we must put strategy first, then spending. Our defense vision will drive our defense budget, not the other way around. Our nation also needs a clear strategy to confront the threats of the 21st century, threats that are more widespread and less certain. They range from terrorists who threaten with bombs to tyrants and rogue nations intent upon developing weapons of mass destruction. To protect our own people, our allies and friends, we must develop and we must deploy effective missile defenses.
And as we transform our military, we can discard cold war relics, and reduce our own nuclear forces to reflect today's needs. A strong America is the world's best hope for peace and freedom. Yet the cause of freedom rests on more than our ability to defend ourselves and our allies. Freedom is exported every day, as we ship goods and products that improve the lives of millions of people. Free trade brings greater political and personal freedom. 
Each of the previous five presidents has had the ability to negotiate far-reaching trade agreements. Tonight I ask you to give me the strong hand of presidential trade promotion authority, and to do so quickly. As we meet tonight, many citizens are struggling with the high costs of energy. We have a serious energy problem that demands a national energy policy. The West is confronting a major energy shortage that has resulted in high prices and uncertainty. I've asked federal agencies to work with California officials to help speed construction of new energy sources. And I've directed Vice President Cheney, Commerce Secretary Evans, Energy Secretary Abraham, and other senior members of my administration to develop a national energy policy. 
Our energy demand outstrips our supply. We can produce more energy at home while protecting our environment, and we must. We can produce more electricity to meet demand, and we must. We can promote alternative energy sources and conservation, and we must. America must become more energy independent, and we will.
Perhaps the biggest test of our foresight and courage will be reforming Medicare and Social Security. Medicare's finances are strained, and its coverage is outdated. 
Ninety-nine percent of employer-provided health plans offer some form of prescription drug coverage; Medicare does not. The framework for reform has been developed by Senators Frist and Breaux and Congressman Thomas, and now is the time to act. Medicare must be modernized. And we must make sure that every senior on Medicare can choose a health care plan that offers prescription drugs. 
Seven years from now, the baby boom generation will begin to claim Social Security benefits. Everyone in this chamber knows that Social Security is not prepared to fully fund their retirement. And we only have a couple of years to get prepared. Without reform, this country will one day awaken to a stark choice: either a drastic rise in payroll taxes, or a radical cut in retirement benefits. There's a better way. 
This spring I will form a presidential commission to reform Social Security. The commission will make its recommendations by next fall. Reform should be based on these principles: It must preserve the benefits of all current retirees and those nearing retirement. It must return Social Security to sound financial footing. And it must offer personal savings accounts to younger workers who want them. 
Social Security now offers workers a return of less than 2 percent on the money they pay into the system. To save the system, we must increase that by allowing younger workers to make safe, sound investments that yield a higher rate of return. 
Ownership, access to wealth and independence should not be the privilege of a few. They are the hope of every American, and we must make them the foundation of Social Security. 
By confronting the tough challenge of reform, by being responsible with our budget, we can earn the trust of the American people. And, we can add to that trust by enacting fair and balanced election and campaign reforms. 
The agenda I have set before you tonight is worthy of a great nation. America's a nation at peace, but not a nation at rest. Much has been given to us, and much is expected. 
Let us agree to bridge old divides. But let us also agree that our good will must be dedicated to great goals. Bipartisanship is more than minding our manners, it is doing our duty.
No one can speak in this Capitol and not be awed by its history. So many turning points, debates in these chambers have reflected the collected or divided conscience of our country. And when we walk through Statuary Hall, and see those men and women of marble, we're reminded of their courage and achievement.
Yet America's purpose is never found only in statues or history. America's purpose always stands before us. 
Our generation must show courage in a time of blessing, as our nation has always shown in times of crisis. And our courage, issue by issue, can gather to greatness, and serve our country. 
This is the privilege, and responsibility, we share. And if we work together, we can prove that public service is noble. 
We all came here for a reason. We all have things we want to accomplish, and promises to keep. "Juntos podemos" -- "together we can." We can make Americans proud of their government. Together, we can share in the credit of making our country more prosperous and generous and just, and earn from our conscience and from our fellow citizens the highest possible praise: well done, good and faithful servants. Thank you, all. Good night. And God bless.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET; 
Response From the Democrats

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the response to President Bush's first joint address to Congress last night as delivered by the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, and the House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt.

Mr. Daschle
 The prosperity that you have built these last eight years has given us all a chance to live better lives at every age. But this opportunity will be squandered if we repeat the mistakes of a generation ago. 
 In 1981, Dick and I sat in the House chamber when another new president talked to the American people about stimulating our economy. The words spoken that evening were strikingly similar to the message we heard tonight. We were promised that if we gave huge tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, the benefits would trickle down, deficits would disappear and the economy would flourish.
Congress supported that experiment. It was a huge mistake. As President Bush's own Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said recently, it put America "in a ditch that was horrendous." Deficits skyrocketed. The national debt quadrupled.. . .
The president's plan is deeply unfair to middle-income Americans. The wealthiest l percent, people who make an average of over $900,000 a year, get 43 percent of the president's tax cut. The president also wants to eliminate the estate tax for the wealthiest of the wealthy. Democrats want to make it easier for you to pass on your family farm and small business to the next generation, and our estate tax plan does that. But the president's proposal provides so much to America's wealthiest families that they themselves are calling it a mistake. Bill Gates Sr., Warren Buffett, members of the Rockefeller family have said it gives so much to so few that it will actually force tax increases, or cuts in Social Security and Medicare and other essential programs. They're right. And the president's estate tax cut is only part of the reason.
Let us be clear: All Americans deserve a tax cut. But surely, the wealthiest among us should not get it at the expense of working families. There's a better way.

Mr. Gephardt
If what the president said tonight sounded too good to he true, it probably is. . . .
We recognize that the president campaigned on an agenda. So did we. Where our agendas coincide let's make quick -- quick progress for the people. Where our agendas differ, we ask the president to demonstrate his leadership by reaching out for the benefit of all Americans. If he extends his hand, we will grasp it. Tonight, we extend ours.
The things that are most meaningful in our lives often require real effort to meet others halfway. Business partnerships. Friendships. Marriages. It's the same with our democracy. We can do what the people sent us here to do if the president is willing to join us in the middle.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush's Budget Strategy 

 BODY:
In his poised, focused and warmly received address to Congress last night, President Bush presented a vision of government as "active but limited, engaged but not overbearing." It was a polished debut, with some eloquent flourishes that showcased Mr. Bush's likability, self-confidence and, above all, his determination to move beyond the Republicans' reflexive anti-government ideology. Especially noteworthy was Mr. Bush's call for an end to racial profiling by the police. He also spoke fervently of schools that reach "every child in America," another of his many gestures to Democrats, minorities and others still skeptical of his mandate. He outlined a creative path between "those who want more government regardless of the cost" and "those who want less government, regardless of the need."
 But this balanced tone could not disguise the tale told by Mr. Bush's numbers. The budget that he is proposing is distorted by his insistence on financing a bigger tax cut than is needed, fair or prudent. The nation saw an amiable presentation of the most ideologically driven budget since Ronald Reagan's supply-side offering in 1981. In order to finance his tax cut, Mr. Bush would gamble with fiscal discipline and sacrifice flexibility on spending. Indeed, the polls say that Americans recognize that his tax cut is weighted toward the rich and that it jeopardizes the ability to pay down the debt, fend off deficits and finance education, retirement and health. 
 Last night Mr. Bush did not change his tax cut proposal, but he did change the spin. He made it sound as if he and his budget aides had spent the last few weeks trying to set aside large chunks of money to do all the things that Americans want, and that after that exercise, there was "still money left over," as he said repeatedly, for the tax cut of the precise size he called for last year.
But as even nonpartisan experts recognize, his $1.6 trillion cut is actually closer to $2.6 trillion once allowances are made for its retroactivity, lost debt-service savings and Congress's determination to change other tax laws to make Mr. Bush's package fully effective. That means that the $1 trillion "contingency fund" that Mr. Bush said he wanted to set aside for the next 10 years will be almost all eaten up. Mr. Bush boasted that he would use $2 trillion for paying down the debt over 10 years. But that is far less than the $2.9 trillion generated by the Social Security and Medicare trust funds that most members of Congress want to use for that purpose. The underlying danger is that the president's plan will siphon revenues from these two big retirement trust funds to finance the tax cut and other selected budget items.
Mr. Bush was right to say that continuing the big spending increases of the last few years could become a "dangerous road to deficits." But he left out the fact that the same can be said for unrestrained tax cuts. The Bush tax plan, coupled with big increases in education, defense, science research and a few other areas, in the context of an overall 4 percent growth rate, translates into significant cuts in many programs. Mr. Bush did not mention that last night, because to do so would have underlined the distorting effect of the tax cut. The tax cut has also forced him to introduce the dubious theory that only two-thirds of the national debt is "available" to be retired and the rest can be ignored for now.
In the end, it was a stylistically impressive but substantively frustrating performance on a historic night when, for the first time since 1954, Americans saw only Republicans on the House rostrum. The economy is sputtering some after the longest expansion in American history, but the government still has significant resources. Mr. Bush's many declarations that government must play a role in improving schools, promoting a patients' bill of rights and many other challenges may lower the temperature of Washington's destructive ideological wars. Mr. Bush was right to remind legislators that "bipartisanship is more than minding our manners, it is doing our duty." In that spirit, Congress should push Mr. Bush toward a better-proportioned budget that would allow for prudent tax relief for middle-income Americans, paying down the debt, modernizing the military, shoring up Social Security and Medicare and financing schools and prescription drug benefits. Working together toward that goal, he and Congress could then reach the truly "reasonable and responsible" approach to budgeting that he spoke of last night.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET: THE DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE; 
Democrats Cite Deficit Fears In Opposing Bush's Tax Plan

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
The Democratic leaders of Congress tonight signaled a muscular battle against President Bush's signature $1.6 trillion tax cut, charging that it threatens the future fiscal health of Social Security and Medicare and could lead the nation back to an era of deficits.
 Vying with Mr. Bush for public opinion, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri raised doubts about whether his numbers were sound and his tax cuts fair to the middle class in the televised Democratic response to Mr. Bush's address to a joint session of Congress. 
 At the same time, they presented their own party as a centrist steward of fiscal responsibility, showcasing the Democrats' call for a smaller tax cut, of below $1 trillion, and more money devoted to debt reduction as the responsible course for the era of surpluses. 
"If what we heard tonight sounds too good to be true, it probably is," said Mr. Gephardt, who was sitting side by side with Mr. Daschle in a Capitol library. He said Mr. Bush's tax cut means "he cannot possibly keep his commitment to leave no child behind." And he said Mr. Bush "fails to set aside the resources Social Security and Medicare will need" as baby boomers retire and strain the retirement system.
"President Bush's budget numbers simply don't add up," Mr. Gephardt said. "Ours do. His plan leaves no money for anything except tax cuts. Ours does. Our plan is better. It invests in the greatest needs and highest priorities of our nation."
It was the first time since Mr. Bush's own father was in the White House that the Democrats were the ones delivering the opposition response and party members said they were keenly aware that this was a moment to try to move beyond the controversy over Bill Clinton's pardons and to show that they can mount a constructive and effective opposition.
Through their joint appearance the Democrats hoped to symbolize party unity and their themes were picked up and amplified by many in their party.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who was the defeated vice-presidential contender, said, "the American economy appears to have a slight head cold right now. If we take the medicine that President Bush is offering, I'm afraid we'll have a bad case of pneumonia."
Senator Robert C. Byrd, a West Virgina Democrat, said it would be "sheer madness" to approve the president's tax cut at a time of other demands. 
And Representative Martin Frost of Texas, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus, said, "President Bush makes a good sales pitch, but underneath the soft rhetoric, his tax plan is just as unfair and irresponsible as anything we've seen from right-wing Congressional Republicans over the past several years."
Mr. Bush's effort to pass his tax cut will be his first defining battle in Congress. So far only one Democrat, Senator Zell Miller of Georgia, has broken party ranks to support Mr. Bush, while two Senate Republicans, James M. Jeffords of Vermont and Lincoln D. Chafee of Rhode Island, have come out against it as too large.
Some other Republicans have also expressed discomfort. Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, said tonight that he believed in a tax cut, but "the question is how big." Mr. Bush cannot afford to lose many Republican votes with the Senate split 50-50.
In a sign of the battle ahead, Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, showed that the president and his party will be putting pressure on Democrats up for re-election in 2002 from southern states that Mr. Bush won, and suggested the president would yet get Democratic converts.
"How is Max Cleland going to vote?" he asked in an interview with the Bloomberg News Service, referring to a Democratic Senator from Georgia. "He is up next year. I think he would be under some pressure." He also suggested that Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana would be under similar pressure, saying, "if she doesn't vote for it, she is going to pay a price for it."
Mr. Daschle today reacted sharply, saying, "I'm not going to debate where Senators Landrieu and Cleland stand. They can speak for themselves. I think it's unfortunate that any one of us would speak for another senator. I don't pretend to do that, and I don't know that they appreciate it either." 
He said he was "very confident" that the tax cut that passes Congress will be different from Mr. Bush's proposal.
The fight in Congress over the tax cut may well be determined by public opinion. 
In an effort to ride any momentum picked up by Mr. Bush tonight, Republican leaders now plan to pass one element of the tax cut plan -- marginal rate reductions -- through the House as early as next week. A fierce battle is expected for the votes of centrists in both parties. House Democrats today sent a letter of protest to Mr. Bush saying that to move forward with tax cuts before a budget "would be a critical mistake."
Democrats say they have been heartened by recent polls suggesting Mr. Bush has not made much headway in selling his tax cut since taking office.
A survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that a modest plurality of Americans or 43 percent support Mr. Bush's tax cut although many fewer people favor using the federal surplus for a tax cut than for using it to shore up Social Security and Medicare. It also showed that a large majority of Americans believe the president's plan will benefit some people more than others.
Democrats today played to all those doubts while at the same time trying not to look obstructionist. They endorsed tax cuts, but a different plan. Mr. Gephardt spoke of "principled compromise." And Mr. Daschle said that on matters where the Democrats agreed with Mr. Bush such as his literacy initiative or proposed increases in military pay, "we will work with him and work hard to turn those ideas into law."
"When he makes proposals with which we disagree, we will work with him to find common ground," he said. "But when he insists on proposals that threaten the prosperity of all Americans -- or that harm Social Security or Medicare, we will fight."
Mr. Daschle recalled the Reagan tax cut of 1981, which helped contribute to an era of federal deficits and debt. Both he and Mr. Gephardt ultimately voted for that tax cut. "We were promised that if we gave huge tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans the benefits would trickle down, deficits would disappear and the economy would flourish," Mr. Daschle said. "Congress supported that experiment. It was a huge mistake."
He said, "It took us 18 years, four acts of Congress and a lot of hard work by the American people to get out of that ditch."
"Now America has a choice," Mr. Daschle added. "What shall we do with the blessings of our new prosperity? Our first priority must be to continue paying down the trillions of dollars in federal debt Washington ran up in the 1980's. We can't just pass this debt onto our children -- not when we have the ability to pay it off."

HEADLINE: Neither Barren Nor Remote 

BYLINE:  By William Cronon; William Cronon is an environmental historian at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis. 

 BODY:
Oil or wilderness? This is the question at the center of the new energy bill that Senator Frank Murkowski of Alaska has just introduced, following through on President Bush's campaign promise to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.
 When Americans encounter the word "wilderness," a number of images come to mind. A dramatic mountain landscape of icy peaks and sublime vistas. A place remote from human settlements, untouched by human hands. A land worthy of protection precisely because it is so isolated. Unfortunately, these images obscure some of the most important qualities of the Alaskan lands that the Bush administration seeks to develop. 
 For one thing, the part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge whose fate is now being debated is flat, boggy terrain of the kind most of us probably associate more with mosquitoes than with sublimity. It doesn't exactly conform to the scenic conventions of an Ansel Adams photograph. For another, those who wish to drill in the refuge say it is so far away, so isolated from places where most Americans live, that almost no one will ever go there. For them, its remoteness is one reason we should exploit it for oil.
But perceiving the Arctic Refuge as "empty" or "remote" is just plain wrong. In fact, far from being pristine, uninhabited wilderness, the refuge is sacred ground to the Gwich'in people, who have long inhabited this landscape.
Today numbering 7,000 people in 15 villages, the Gwich'in are the northernmost of Athabascan-speaking Indians. Their lives have traced the path of the caribou for thousands of years, so much so that they say every caribou carries some human heart in it, and every human heart some caribou.
The narrow coastal plain that the Bush administration would open to drilling is where the 129,000 animals in the Porcupine Caribou herd give birth to their calves -- a region where the Gwich'in have long chosen not to hunt, calling it "vadzaih googii vi dehk'it gwanlii" -- the sacred place where life begins.
Just as the refuge is not untouched by human beings, thinking of it as remote and disconnected from the places where most Americans live is equally wrong. Migratory birds in all but one state of the union -- Hawaii -- spend important parts of their lives in this northern breeding ground.
We often forget how far the birds around us migrate over the course of an ordinary year. See a semipalmated sandpiper in New York, a red-throated loon in Minnesota, a snow goose in California, and you may well be witnessing a part of the Arctic refuge.
Among the 180 bird species that use the refuge is the tundra swan, once more familiarly known as the whistling swan. After raising their young, these birds migrate thousands of miles across the continent to their winter homes along the Atlantic Coast from North Carolina to Maryland. From the perspective of a tundra swan, Washington, D. C., and the homeland of the Gwich'in are part of a single ecosystem.
If migrating birds remind us that the neighborhoods where we live are in fact linked to the refuge, then we should also remember that how we live is what puts the refuge at risk. The ways we drive our cars, heat our homes and otherwise consume oil are the biggest single threat it faces.
The United States Geological Survey estimates that the refuge might contain between 4 billion and 12 billion barrels of oil, with a mean estimate of 7 billion (though much of this could never be pumped out economically). Measured against our current rate of consumption of roughly 18 million barrels a day, it would be gone in about a year if it had to meet our full demand.
From the perspective of history, it's worth contemplating the rather astonishing fact that we're capable of consuming 7 billion barrels of oil in a year. Such a supply would have provided all of America's needs from the first discovery of oil in Pennsylvania in 1859 until about 1924: the first 65 years of the modern petroleum economy.
The debate over the refuge, in other words, is as much about our dependency on petroleum as it is about the fate of distant caribou and other wild creatures.
The refuge contains oil, yes. But it also contains the largest, most diverse example on our public lands of an Arctic ecosystem in its full magnificence, with native people living in, using and cherishing that ecosystem as they have for millennia. The fact that it does not completely conform to our preconceptions of wilderness should not prevent us from seeing that its value cannot simply be measured in barrels or dollars. Deciding not to drill there is a way of recognizing how much the life of that faraway land is tied to our own.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW; 
BUSH, SPELLING OUT AGENDA TO CONGRESS, MAKES TAX CUT CENTERPIECE OF THE BUDGET

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
President Bush turned full force to the difficult task of selling the Congress and the country on his legislative agenda tonight, using a nationally televised address from the House chamber to cast his proposed $1.6 trillion tax cut as reasonable and responsible.
 In the most formal and comprehensive speech of his nascent presidency, Mr. Bush said a blessed era of robust surpluses would enable the federal government to reduce taxes by that amount over 10 years and still spend all that it needed to on education, prescription drugs and social programs. 
 The result, Mr. Bush said, would be a government balanced between a constructive involvement in people's lives and an equally beneficial detachment from them. 
"Government has a role, and an important role," Mr. Bush said, in what amounted to an articulation of his guiding philosophy. "Yet too much government crowds out initiative and hard work, private charity and the private economy. Our new governing vision says government should be active, but limited; engaged, but not overbearing." Page A12. 
At the same time, Democrats tried to present their own party as the centrist steward of fiscal responsibility, showcasing their call for a smaller tax cut and more debt reduction. Page A14. 
Mr. Bush's speech tonight, analogous to a State of the Union address but without that title, represented his best, most visible opportunity to make his case, not only for a tax cut but also for his education proposals and his plan for a partial privatization of the Social Security entitlement program.
The speech was intended to set the stage for the release on Wednesday of an actual outline of Mr. Bush's federal budget for the 2002 fiscal year. The administration is expected to release a fully detailed budget in April.
But the speech was also an early and important test, with a result to be determined down the road, of Mr. Bush's powers of persuasion, of his ability not only to command affection but also to inspire confidence and shape public opinion.
And it seemed to mark a turning point from the grace period of Mr. Bush's charm offensive to the uncertain, inevitably contentious work of getting the legislation he wants passed.
Mr. Bush navigated that juncture in a steady voice that betrayed few if any traces of nervousness, though he mistakenly said education was "not my first priority," then circled back to make it clear that education indeed was.
As he had during his presidential campaign, Mr. Bush presented cutting taxes as a central part of that vision. His pitch had a populist curve.
"Yogi Berra once said, 'When you come to a fork in the road, take it,' " Mr. Bush said, intentionally eliciting laughter. "Now we come to a fork in the road."
"We have two choices," Mr. Bush told the hundreds of politicians, diplomats and military officers who filled row after row of seats in the historic chamber. One of those choices, Mr. Bush said, was to increase the size of government.
But, he added, "We must take a different path. The other choice is to let the American people spend their own money to meet their own needs. I hope you will join me in standing firmly on the side of the people."
That was more than a bit of idle oratory; it was a direct appeal for votes for a tax plan sweeping enough that its enactment is by no means guaranteed. Mr. Bush's aides acknowledge that his success or failure with this legislation, the centerpiece of his first-year agenda, could affect his entire presidency.
Mr. Bush's first five weeks in office were relatively tranquil, in part because a furious swirl of controversy followed Bill Clinton out of the White House and diverted attention from Mr. Bush.
But expressions of discontent with his proposals are growing louder, and as Mr. Bush seeks to quell them, he does so with what one recent poll indicated was the lowest job approval rating of a president at this point in his first term in the last 50 years. Although Mr. Bush won the electoral vote -- after a 36-day dispute over the count in Florida -- he lost the popular vote.
Democratic leaders are amply aware of this, and in their response to Mr. Bush's speech they articulated an unwavering opposition to the size of his suggested tax cut and an utter disbelief in his arithmetic, suggesting that he was living in a fiscal dream world.
"If what the president said tonight sounded too good to be true, it probably is," said the House minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, in a televised address immediately following Mr. Bush's. Mr. Gephardt was joined by the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Daschle have proposed a tax cut that would be about half the size of Mr. Bush's and much less generous to wealthy Americans. "President Bush's budget numbers simply don't add up," Mr. Gephardt said. "Ours do. His plan leaves no money for anything except tax cuts. Ours does."
Mr. Bush had the taller of the bully pulpits tonight, and he occupied it with a demeanor more serious, and with fewer lighthearted moments, than he had exhibited at many public appearances over recent weeks.
His remarks lasted 49 minutes, one minute longer than those of his father, former President George Bush, during the first year of his presidency but 9 minutes shorter than those of Mr. Clinton in 1993.
Tracing the general contours of his budget, Mr. Bush at times provided specific figures and at times did not, and he dwelled solely on those aspects of the federal budget that he would increase, skipping over those areas that would be cut.
Mr. Bush said that after devoting plenty of money to strengthen the Social Security and Medicare entitlement programs -- the $238 billion for Medicare next year, he said, would be enough money for a new prescription drug benefit for low-income elderly people -- he would advocate an overall 4 percent increase in discretionary spending, which he said was above the rate of inflation. 
That is lower than the average of roughly 6 percent by which discretionary spending grew in each of the last three years, and many Democrats have said that it will not enable Mr. Bush to maintain the current level of government services.
Even so, Mr. Bush stressed a commitment to paying down the federal debt by $2 trillion over the next 10 years. It was a point that Mr. Bush and his aides had been underlining more boldly over the past week than they had during his presidential campaign, a change in emphasis that seems to speak to Americans' persistent concerns about the affordability of a large tax cut.
But while Mr. Bush called that "more debt repaid more quickly than has ever been repaid by any nation at any time in history," that figure is lower than the one recommended by many Democrats, who want to eliminate all $3.4 trillion of publicly held debt.
Although that tax cut and many other elements of Mr. Bush's agenda, which sounded extremely broad and optimistic as Mr. Bush ranged over it tonight, are music to conservatives' ears, Mr. Bush emphasized many individual programs with inevitably bipartisan support, giving Democrats in the audience little choice but to rise to their feet and applaud.
He talked about the $4.9 billion he wanted to spend over the next five years to improve national parks and the tax credits he wanted to give to low-income people so they could buy health insurance. He said that he wanted community health centers to serve more people and that he wanted to spend $700 million over 10 years to provide mentors to children with parents in prison.
He was trying to hit a centrist melody and a moderate tone, and the people sitting at the president's invitation around the first lady, Laura Bush, reflected that desire, along with Mr. Bush's ongoing efforts to extend the Republican Party's reach to a more diverse base.
Mr. Bush talked anew about the importance of bipartisan cooperation.
"Bipartisanship is more than minding our manners," he said during his speech. "It is doing our duty."
Mr. Bush delivered a wish list, covering in broad strokes virtually everything he had advocated over the previous 38 days of his presidency or during his campaign: raises for military men and women; a modernization of the military; accountability for schools that receive federal money. 
In the foreground was his suggested tax cut, which he portrayed as an effort to help Americans ascend the economic ladder, even though the largest benefits in dollar terms go to the wealthy.
"I did not throw darts to come up with a number for the tax cut," Mr. Bush said. "I did not take a poll, or develop an arbitrary formula that might sound good. I looked at problems in the tax code and calculated the cost to fix them."
Prosperity, he said, made a reduction of taxes possible, all the while compelling Americans to reach out to those still left behind. He said at the beginning of his speech that an artist "could paint two very different pictures of our country," one showing rising energy prices, failing schools and pockets of poverty. 
The other would show incredible progress, Mr. Bush said, "and tonight I challenge and invite Congress to work with me to use the resources of one picture to repaint the other."
At the end of his remarks, he returned to that theme, saying: "Our generation must show courage in a time of blessing, as our nation has always shown in times of crisis. And our courage, issue by issue, can gather to greatness, and serve our country."

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
A Short Shopping List

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
President Bush's budget speech, with its emphasis on his tax cut, education proposals and debt reduction plan, reflected both his campaign and his record as governor of Texas, but it was more narrowly focused than most presidents have chosen to be in their first nationally televised address to Congress.
 While Mr. Bush in his speech tonight talked about issues like rebuilding the military, encouraging charitable contributions and fighting rising energy prices and racial profiling, he stopped short of offering an array of new programs and mini-initiatives. He talked of a government that was "active but limited." 
 Much the same could have been said of his speech.
Mr. Bush did not go quite as far as Gerald R. Ford, who said, "I have no legislative shopping list here this evening," when he addressed Congress just three days after Richard Nixon resigned. Yet neither did he offer the sort of vast legislative agendas that Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Bill Clinton all presented to the Congress and the nation in their first speeches.
For this President Bush, a more focused approach is a familiar strategy. As Calvin C. Jillson, chairman of the political science department at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said this week, "In each legislative session he identified one or two signature issues." 
During both of Mr. Bush's terms as governor, the issues he pushed were the same ones he embraced during his campaigns, much as his speech to the Congress tonight echoed his presidential campaign themes of education reform, big tax cuts and support for so-called faith-based charitable organizations.
In Texas, his strategy of hewing to a few issues allowed him to receive credit for legislative accomplishments like education spending, tort reform and lower property taxes. And by not becoming embroiled in too many legislative fights, he also largely avoided criticism on those contentious issues he ducked.
How well that will work in Washington is uncertain. The presidency is a bigger job than a governorship. Congress is here all the time, not just for a few months every other year, and the press is more skeptical. Most of all, the agenda is harder to control, and not just the legislative agenda. 
In five weeks in office, Mr. Bush has used his public speeches and appearances to try to rally support for his education plan, his call for a $1.6 trillion tax cut, his support for using religious groups to run community programs and his intention to restructure the military. 
But even with this disciplined communications strategy, the new president has often been overshadowed not just by his predecessor's scandalous departure, but by accusations of espionage at the F.B.I., a sunken Japanese trawler and a bombing attack against Iraq, which he called "routine." On each occasion, Mr. Bush was working so hard at staying on his message of the week that he seemed oddly detached from the events dominating the news.
Tonight he faced no competition when he said that tax cuts were required for the sake of fairness. Moreover, he said: "To create economic growth and opportunity, we must put money back into the hands of the people who buy goods and create jobs. We must act quickly."
But he also tried to anticipate the Democratic opposition by committing himself to debt reduction, a subject he rarely raised during his presidential campaign.
He insisted that his plan "pays down an unprecedented amount of our national debt, and then when money is still left over, my plan returns it to the people." In fact, his opponents will argue that it does the reverse, cutting taxes and paying down the debt with what is left.
The speech, and the follow-up coverage and discussion of it over the next few days, may allow him to seize the nation's attention at a critical moment.
As Leon E. Panetta, former Budget Committee chairman in the House and later both budget director and chief of staff for Mr. Clinton observed today, a president's first budget speech is really "his last campaign speech." From now on, Mr. Panetta said at a forum held by the Center for National Policy, a public policy organization with Democratic roots, the task is governing -- and of dealing with the historical truth that "every president, in the course of a political campaign, promises more than he can deliver."
Even before tonight's speech was delivered, Democrats were seeing that fault in Mr. Bush. Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, argued that a tax cut as large as Mr. Bush wants would preclude reasonable domestic spending on other items he says he supports, like education and medical research. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said Mr. Bush's argument that all the debt could not be paid off as "a shell game that allows him to spend $900 billion that he knows he needs for his other priorities." 
Mr. Spratt also argued that it was foolhardy to rely on 10-year surplus predictions. Even Bill Archer, a supporter of the Bush tax cut and the former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said, "When you're looking at 10 years, you're in never-never land."
The Democrats, in essence, were demanding that Mr. Bush explain in detail how he will pay for the priorities he outlined in his speech, items from tax cuts to better schools that he insisted the nation could afford.
Mr. Bush's choice of a more limited agenda, though, may have more to it than Texas habits and the discipline of staying on message. Charles O. Jones, former president of the American Political Science Association and a scholar of presidential-Congressional relations, said it was a "perfectly rational strategy to emphasize a few things and see how most of the other things play out." Biting off too many issues at once, as Mr. Clinton found out in 1993, has its own costs.
Mr. Bush's more focused strategy, Mr. Jones suggested, may have two timely rationales. One is the close division on Capitol Hill: "Given the politics of a 50-50 government," he said, "it's real hard to come on like gangbusters with a long list of things which you must have." Second, he said, "In the context of basically good times, the public isn't saying 'do this or else,' " and there is probably no single problem that must be solved for politicians to protect their jobs in 2002 or 2004.
Within his party, however, Mr. Bush is under pressure to push his tax-cutting measure through quickly. Republicans worry that a defeat or a delay on this signature issue, even though voters are not yet clamoring for tax relief and some prefer using the government's surplus to erase the debt, could cripple Mr. Bush politically. That is why Republicans rose for a standing ovation when he said: "The growing surplus exists because taxes are too high and government is charging more than it needs. The people of America have been overcharged, and on their behalf, I am here asking for a refund."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TO BUSINESS; 
I Know You, You Know Me, Let's Sell Goods Online Privately

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS; Robert Strauss frequently writes about business and technology.

 BODY:
A FEW years ago, Neil S. Novich, the chairman and chief executive of Ryerson Tull, was lamenting the torrents of paperwork in the offices of this Chicago company, a metals processor and distributor. There had to be a better way, Mr. Novich said. Faxes, order sheets and paper were everywhere. 
 So the information technology staff at Ryerson Tull created RyTEC, a private Internet exchange in which companies are connected with their suppliers and their customers. Now the company does $200 million a year in business, about 7 percent of its $3 billion a year in revenue, with its regular customers through the exchange. Those customers, using a password, can enter the RyTEC site and order items any time of day. The monetary savings are hard to calculate, Mr. Novich said, but the headaches eliminated have been remarkable. 
 RyTEC has reduced the torrent of paperwork, Mr. Novich said. "What it does most is reduce errors," he added. "When you have people manually entering hundreds of items, something can go wrong easily."
While not attracting the attention of public exchanges, which have languished, private business-to-business exchanges are thriving. Their use has been increasing because companies have found them convenient for tracking and monitoring sales while building customer loyalty.
A private exchange includes variations of closed-Internet supply systems that are used by businesses of all types. Some private exchanges operate between a company and its supplier; others are designed to help initiate business relationships between companies within a corporation; still others may be intended to provide a service, like technology support or the filing of statistics or information, for a company.
Bruce D. Temkin, an analyst at Forrester Research, an Internet research company, said that "1999 was the year of the public exchange."
"Industry consortia said they would reinvent the world," Mr. Temkin said. "But with public exchanges, you had to sell everyone on it and inform everyone how to use it and clear everyone who wanted to come in. Private exchanges, you deal with your steady partners. You tighten collaboration with those partners, and that is where efficiencies come in and relationships are continued."
Private exchanges have many guises. For example, the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company owns several different businesses. One is Amphenol in Wallingford, Conn., which makes and distributes electronic cables and connectors.
When Mark Peppin, the purchasing chief for Amphenol, found himself in chronic need of office supplies, he turned to a private exchange consisting of firms owned by Kohlberg Kravis. On the private exchange, he found WorldCrest, an office supply distributor in Atlanta, which was able to help.
"I'm probably saving 12 to 15 percent from using an open office-supply company site" like Staples.com, said Mr. Peppin, who also finds the private exchange convenient.
"I'm a morning person," he said. "Now I can come in at 7 a.m. and knock out a few orders, where I would have had to wait until someone was in their office before. The Internet has made things like this almost imperative."
I.B.M. participates in private exchanges in three ways. As a computer services company, it builds systems for other companies that want to start private exchanges. As a seller of computer equipment and services, it has a private exchange for regular customers. And, like Mr. Peppin at Amphenol, John Wilson, I.B.M.'s director for business-to-business services, has to worry about whether there are enough toner cartridges for the hundreds of copiers in I.B.M.'s offices. So Mr. Wilson uses a private exchange to buy office supplies.
"The private exchange we use for buying office equipment has saved us millions in maverick buying alone," he said. "For instance, that toner goes out and a conscientious employee would go to Staples on his way home, buy one and expense it out of petty cash. Now we're on an Internet exchange. The toner is there before we need it. It's bought wholesale and the hassle is nothing."
Private exchanges, while seemingly simple, have not become viable until recently because of the storage and bandwidth capacity that are needed.
"The capacity has to be there to hold as much data as the customer and its suppliers want, plus it has to be fast and error-free, which means there had to be servers strong enough to do the work," said Mark A. Salser, the senior vice president for advanced technologies at Oracle, which designs and builds business-to-business exchanges. 
"People say it is not much different than what Yahoo and Amazon did, which is true to an extent," Mr. Salser said, "but for so many companies to have this kind of auction and data-management system, it was only available recently."
Tim Clark, an analyst for Jupiter Research, which tracks Internet businesses, noted another advantage of this type of exchange: "People like private exchanges because they keep control of customers and suppliers. They don't have to make things public that they don't want to." 
"In a way, this is just another advancement in technology," Mr. Clark said. "It is replacing faxes, which replaced phone calls, and so on. It becomes more and more error-free and, thus, saves everyone money."
But at least some business people want to preserve a part of the old style of operating. 
Dean Berman, a partner in Harbor Seafood, a seafood procurement and processing business in New Hyde Park, N.Y., has been using Gofish.com, an exchange for the fishing industry. He finds it efficient and cost-effective, but sometimes not as much fun, say, as using the phone.
"If I need Thailand tiger shrimp now, I can go there and get a good price -- it works," Mr. Berman said. "But sometimes I just want to get razzed by my Maryland suppliers about the Ravens beating the Giants, or razz them back about the Yankees.
"Business is about money, but it is about relationships, too," he said. "That's why the Internet is good, but it will remain only a part of our business."
