HEADLINE: A Week of Partial Recovery

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
An unexpected drop in unemployment helped stocks post their first back-to-back gains in almost a month yesterday.
 Alcoa, National Semiconductor and Boeing rallied after the government said that the February jobless rate fell to 4.5 percent, down from 4.6 percent in January.
The jobs report is ''a good indication that the economy is healthy,'' said Joseph T. Keating, who manages about $4 billion as chief investment officer at First American Asset Management in Birmingham, Ala. ''It says earnings will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace.'' 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.3 percent, recouping almost a third of losses from the previous week. Last week, the Dow fell 4.22 percent, the worst weekly drop in four years. 
 The S.& P. 500-stock index regained about a quarter of last week's decline, rising 1.1 percent for the week. The Nasdaq has added 0.8 percent in the last five days.
 The Dow rose 15.62 points yesterday, to close at 12,276.32. The S.& P. 500 increased 0.96 point, to 1,402.85. 
 The Nasdaq, dragged lower by a drop in Yahoo's stock price, fell 0.18 point, to end at 2,387.55.
 Susan Schmidt Bies, a Federal Reserve governor, said defaults on mortgages to the riskiest borrowers might accelerate, a concern that contributed to the widespread fall in global stocks last week.
 The stock losses since Feb. 27 erased about $1 trillion of value in the American markets. Data last week on new-home sales and durable-goods orders reinforced the view that economic growth was slowing.
 ''You have a market kind of searching for direction,'' said Kurt Brunner, who helps manage $1.5 billion at Swarthmore Group Inc. in Philadelphia. ''Investors have to recognize that we're not seeing that significant a deterioration, that we're not going into a recession.''
 Alcoa, the world's largest maker of aluminum, added 71 cents, to close at $33.20. Boeing rose 62 cents, to $89.51.
 Shares of National Semiconductor, whose chips manage power in electronic devices, jumped $1.14, to end at $26.42 share, after the company's third-quarter results exceeded analysts' estimates. Linear Technology, a maker of chips for cellular phones and computers, rose 66 cents, to $33.38.
 Texas Instruments, the world's largest maker of mobile-phone chips, added 76 cents, to $32.46, after it was upgraded to buy from hold at Stifel, Nicolaus & Company.
 New Century Financial tumbled for a second day on mounting speculation that the company, a leading subprime home lender, would go bankrupt. The company said on Thursday that it had halted new loans and had lined up almost $1 billion in new financing. Shares of the company fell 66 cents, to $3.21.
 New Century will most likely be liquidated, with little value left for shareholders, a Merrill Lynch analyst, Kenneth Bruce, wrote in a report yesterday. 
 The mortgage unit of General Electric in the United States said it would cut 20 percent of its work force as it reduced lending. G.E.'s stock fell 13 cents, to $34.32.
 ''A lot of people are looking at what's going on with the subprime lenders,'' said K. Sean Clark, who oversees $1.2 billion as chief investment officer at Clark Capital Management in Philadelphia. ''The concern for the market is, if the major lending banks begin to rein their lending practices in, it could have a broader impact throughout the rest of the economy.''
 Rising mortgage defaults by subprime borrowers may add more than 500,000 homes to a housing market already troubled by falling prices, according to the bond research firm CreditSights.
 Lennar, the largest American home builder by revenue, lost 49 cents a share, to close at $48.25. Hovnanian Enterprises fell $1.26, to $29.34, after reporting a fiscal first-quarter loss that exceeded analysts' estimates.
 Yahoo dropped $1.59, to $29.12, after a report that AT&T might scale back its alliance with the company. Energy shares were the worst performers among 10 industry groups in the S.& P. 500. Crude oil futures declined 2.6 percent, to $60.05 a barrel in trading in New York.
 Exxon Mobil slipped 73 cents, to $71.12, for the sharpest decline in the Dow industrials.
 Amgen dropped $1.31, to $60.86, after the Food and Drug Administration said that its anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen would get stronger warnings about serious health risks. The F.D.A. also said it was re-evaluating the safety of the drugs.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 19/32, to 100 9/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.59 percent, from 4.51 percent.

HEADLINE: On Wearing Our Salaries On Our Sleeves

BYLINE: By M. P. DUNLEAVEY

 BODY:
I'VE often wondered how it was that the characters in Jane Austen's novels always seemed to know everyone else's income.
 By the time you're on the second page of ''Pride and Prejudice,'' you hear that a young man named Mr. Bingley is about to move into the neighborhood and that his income is $:5,000 a year. Later when Mr. Darcy, the romantic lead of the book, makes his entrance, you quickly learn that his income is $:10,000 a year.
Given how careful we are today to keep mum about all things financial -- inquiring directly about anyone's income is particularly taboo -- it's striking that people appear to have been more frank about money 200 years ago. I'm not sure we've gained anything by abandoning that candor. 
 While it's impossible to know for certain what the mores around money were in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it does seem that a frank discussion of people's assets was not solely a fictional device, according to Jack Lynch, a professor of literature at Rutgers who specializes in the 18th century. 
 After searching through a database of texts from that era, Professor Lynch came up with numerous references to net worth, usually in a romantic context -- suggesting that talking openly about other people's finances was fairly common, especially in regard to courtship and marriage. ''It does seem to be a standard piece of information people talked about -- along the lines of what we mean today when we say, 'What does he do?' '' Professor Lynch said.
 The difference is that asking about someone's job or profession today is a much more indirect way to gauge financial status. It's not that people are less interested -- or less vested in the financial situation of a potential partner today -- but our methods of inquiring have become more veiled. 
 By asking where someone went to school or where he lives or noting the car he drives, we're still trying to ferret out fundamental information that, back then, was traded over tea.
 Of course, at that time people's assets were held primarily in land -- the stock market then being a rather small and dodgy enterprise -- thus income was easier to tally, notes Sean Moore, an assistant professor of literature at the University of New Hampshire, whose focus is economics and finance in the 18th century. ''There was an established land registry then,'' Professor Moore said. ''This would keep track of who owned how much land, how much it was worth and who was renting it.''
 In some ways, especially for women, who didn't have the economic power they wield today, there was a lot more at stake in having access to this information. In a short essay entitled ''How Rich Is Fitzwilliam Darcy?'' published on his blog (http://delong.typepad.com/), Brad DeLong, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, speculated that Mr. Darcy's $:10,000 a year might be worth as much as $6 million today, a rough calculus based on a comparison of purchasing power and average incomes then and now. 
 Knowing that information would have made quite a bit of difference to Elizabeth Bennett, his eventual wife in the book -- or any other woman who crossed his path.
 A person's financial dossier is a lot harder to determine today, and not just when net worth is derived from several sources that you can access only with a password. The very idea of talking about income has been cast as ''vulgar'' and ''improper,'' the province of con artists and gold diggers at worst, and people with no manners at best. But why?
 IT is a truth universally acknowledged that we all whisper about this stuff the minute we leave a dinner party. Yet if Mr. Darcy and Ms. Bennett were a-courting today, it's likely they would have a frank discussion about sexually transmitted diseases early on, while they'd balk at talking openly about money -- even though their financial health might depend on it.
 Although I think putting greater financial disclosure within the bounds of proper etiquette would be beneficial -- as it was two centuries ago -- I wouldn't limit it to romantic relationships. Wouldn't it be less stressful, emotionally and financially, if you could state, without fear of embarrassment, what your own financial limitations were? 
 It's an accident of my job that friends tell me intimate details about their financial lives, but now I realize how valuable it is when everyone knows more or less where everyone else stands. I'm sure Elizabeth Bennett would be amazed we didn't all agree on that point.

HEADLINE: In Tragedy, Glimpsing Oft-Overlooked Newcomers' Lives

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL and NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
They began alighting in New York in the late 1970s, these Malian traders riding the currents of the global economy. After a decade, maybe two, of intense work, they sent for their wives who would bear many children and settle in Harlem apartments and cacophonous old town houses on hilly streets in the Bronx. 
 Before the fire that took five of his children, Moussa Magassa was an early godfather for this tiny but swiftly growing Malian community. He would greet newcomers with a handshake and a meal, and perhaps some cash and help filing legal papers and shipping goods back to Mali.
 His brick town house near Yankee Stadium was known even in Mali as a beacon for new immigrants and a symbol of a Malian's success in America. 
 Tragedy has drawn a city's eyes to this little-known corner of the West African immigrant diaspora. An entrepreneurial group loosely bound by ties of ethnicity and sometimes language, its members have established enclaves known as ''Little Senegal' and ''Little Guinea'' marked by thriving import-export offices and hair-braiding salons. 
 Some, particularly the Senegalese, peddle African goods -- and knock-off Swiss watches -- and some engage in long-haul trucking while still others drive taxis and run general stores and money-transfer offices. 
 But as so often happens, tragedy also exposes an immigrant community's secrets. There is the Malians' practice of taking more than one wife, transplanted by some from village compounds in the hills of western Mali to crowded apartments in the Bronx. There is their often-faltering climb up the entrepreneurial ladder, with attendant business failures and bankruptcies. And there is the tricky business of immigration status: Many Malians are here illegally even as they raise children who become the newest generation of New Yorkers.
 The West Africans -- who number about 50,000, including 6,000 to 10,000 Malians -- have suffered their share of high-profile tragedies in this city. In 1999 police officers in Harlem fatally shot Amadou Diallo, a Guinean peddler, when they mistakenly thought he was reaching for a gun. (It was his wallet.) In 2003 an officer running through a storage facility on the Far West Side shot and killed Ousmane Zongo, who was from Burkina Faso and repaired artwork. 
 Now a fire has consumed much of two families, and Malians on two continents are in mourning.
 Amadou Niangadou, 46, stood on Seventh Avenue and 122nd Street last night and listened to his cellphone trill. All day he had fielded calls from friends in New York and Mali, disconsolate at the news. He said Mr. Magassa, who is a friend of his and is treasurer of the Association of Malians Living Abroad, was in Mali because he was accompanying a blind countryman home.
 ''We are a traveling people, but our bonds back home are very close,'' he said. Mr. Niangadou held up his hand and paused to see who was calling him before continuing: ''Mr. Magassa, this guy, he has a big, big heart.''
 Few places on earth are poorer than Mali, a land twice the size of Texas where 90 percent of the population earns less than $2 a day. But Mali was home to Africa's first great sub-Saharan empire; it took root in the fourth century and had trading at its heart. Malian traders led camel caravans to the Mediterranean. 
 Poverty now fuels that diaspora.
 ''Travel and trade is for the Malians a central part of their identity,'' said Gregory Mann, an associate professor of history at Columbia University and a specialist in Francophone Africa.
 France has 120,000 Malians, but in the 1970s and 1980s, Malians began turning to the United States. Mr. Magassa was in that first wave. Many West Africans turned to street peddling. (When the police cracked down, the Senegalese donned sharp-looking suits and carried goods in attache cases -- these traders are nothing if not adaptable.)
 Mr. Niangadou, who owns an export business, sat with a dozen of his countryman in Kouyate & Freres, a general store and money-transfer store on 122nd Street and described the climb up the ladder:
 ''I started off hauling crates and worked in a supermarket,'' he said. ''Then I began selling cloth and driving goods to other cities. I did 4,000 to 5,000 miles a month.''
 Soon enough, the first arrivals sent for younger relatives. Women arrived in large numbers in the mid-1990s, some possessing entrepreneurial instincts no less formidable than their husbands'. Others land here without education, steeped in old country ways, and submit to their husband's lead.
 Mr. Magassa had two wives, Manthia and Aisse. It is not clear when they arrived in this country, but some of their children were born here. Only two of Mr. Magassa's seven children with Manthia lived through the fire. But all of his four children with Aisse, who lived a floor apart from Manthia, survived. 
 Polygamy is common in Mali and throughout West Africa. But it is illegal in the United States, and it can bar immigrants from gaining permanent legal residency or citizenship. Many West Africans are uncomfortable talking about the practice with an outsider, particularly so soon after the tragic fire.
 But many West Africans say that Mr. Magassa's arrangement is a subterranean feature of life here, particularly for older men who can afford it. At a spacious African hair-braiding salon on 125th Street, Aminata Dia, the Senegalese owner, consulted with her husband before talking about the practice to a reporter. She said men traditionally bring the first wife first, but of late many prefer to bring the youngest.
 ''I wasn't surprised,'' Ms. Dia said. ''It's our religion that allows men to have four wives. But two wives in the same house, it's not so common -- usually they have one wife abroad and one here.''
 A fierce argument erupted about whether this was too volatile an issue to talk about with an outsider. ''All women suffer from polygamy, but our religion says we should not speak,'' said an employee, Aminata Fatou, 29. ''One can't do away with that.''
 Countered Ms. Dia: ''If every woman shuts her mouth, she is complicit. I'm against polygamy -- it's bad for the woman, the man and the children.''
 Then she added a coda: ''If you leave your country, you have to come with the good things, not bring the bad things with you.'' 
 Nor is it easy, even for the entrepreneurial Malians, to balance the demands of building a life here with sending sufficient dollars back to their families and villages in Mali. Malian immigrants in France, to cite just one example, send money back home that is equivalent to France's total foreign aid for Mali. These dollars pay for houses and schools, wells and, that rarest of things in the dusty desert nation, paved roads. 
 These immigrants may hail from generations of traders -- many describe learning their trade by working with fathers in Gambia, Senegal and the Ivory Coast -- but the financial hardships are great. 
 Mr. Magassa held several jobs, including one as a carpenter at the New York City schools, before opening an import-export firm. His older brother, Mody Magassa, owns a shipping firm in Midtown Manhattan.
 But they and a third brother have all filed for bankruptcy. In his 2000 Chapter 13 filing, Mr. Magassa cited $214,700 in assets, $170,000 of it in his house. And he cited $132,124 in liabilities.
 In the general store, Kouyate & Freres, on Thursday night several of the Malian men sipped tea and talked about being laid off from jobs as drivers and clerks.
 Lurking behind their economic troubles is another reality. Roughly 3,5000 Malians enter the United States each year on temporary visas. But precious few attain achieve citizenship: About 85 Malians a year, and as few as 19, since 1996. Only a handful have been granted asylum, typically women seeking refuge from genital cutting, which is widespread in West Africa.
 Evidence of the precarious legal status can be seen in the case of Mamadou Soumare, whose wife, Fatoumata, and three of their four children perished in this week's fire. They lived on the top floor of Mr. Magassa's house. Mr. Soumare wants to bury his wife and children in Mali. But people who know the family said that immigration issues could prevent him from accompanying the bodies home.

HEADLINE: That Great White Whale Through a Wellesian Lens

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
It takes a fool or perhaps a genius to adapt one of the greatest American novels for the stage -- and Orson Welles was a bit of both. He chased 
 ''Moby-Dick'' through much of the 1950s. After writing and starring in ''Moby Dick -- Rehearsed'' in 1955, he made his own film version of that Melville classic for British television before starring in John Huston's. But Welles still wasn't finished, returning to the novel at the end of his life, filming scenes of himself reading it in one of his many unfinished works. (There are remarkable excerpts on YouTube.)
Welles may never have caught the big fish in the same way that he captured, say, William Randolph Hearst in ''Citizen Kane,'' but this gripping revival of ''Moby Dick -- Rehearsed,'' presented by Twenty Feet Productions with a Shakespearean sweep, proves that this was a perfect marriage of man and material. 
 It's easy to forget that Welles was first a man of the theater, and this ferocious drama, a poetic examination of one man's obsession, is, among other things, a celebration of the stage. It begins almost offhandedly with a group of actors filing into the theater where they are to perform ''King Lear.'' 
 In a light, almost documentary style, Welles satirizes backstage small talk: the complaints about critics, pay and academics. When one performer talks about the need for theater, another corrects him: ''Nobody ever needed the theater -- except us. Have you ever heard of an unemployed audience?''
 When the vain star (Seth Duerr) enters, he informs the ensemble that they will be performing ''Moby-Dick'' instead of ''Lear,'' and that he will play Ahab. This framing device provides a justification for the bare-bones adaptation (everyone wears casual clothes and mimes the props), but the director, Marc Silberschatz, is smart to avoid hammering home the theatrical themes, since the play-within-a-play conceit has become a cliche.
 Instead, he concentrates on suspending our disbelief, relying on a direct, simple staging that tells the story with gusto and clarity. The cramped theater, a black box with bad sightlines, actually helps give a sense of being trapped on a rickety ship.
 Welles, who ruthlessly edited Melville's novel down to two hours, would no doubt have approved of Dana Sterling's moody lighting design. But this play rises and falls on the strength of Ahab, and Mr. Duerr is happily up to the challenge. With sunken eyes that betray a touch of madness, he looks like a man losing a battle but refusing to give up. 
 He doesn't perform off his fellow actors so much as recite his lines to the heavens, which makes perfect sense, since he's playing a dictatorial actor playing a dictatorial captain. At his best, Mr. Duerr's booming baritone even brings to mind Welles himself. Call me impressed.''Moby Dick -- Rehearsed'' continues through March 25 at the Richmond Shepard Theater, 309 East 26th Street, Manhattan; (212) 868-4444.

HEADLINE: In Geneva, the Sun Shines Through

BYLINE: By NICK KURCZEWSKI

DATELINE: GENEVA 

 BODY:
The bright lights and unfettered optimism of the auto show here cannot chase away all of the clouds hanging over the industry. During press previews this week, Ford put on a happy face as it introduced a new Mondeo sedan for the European market, even while it undergoes the latest attempt to cut thousands of jobs and turn around a business that has been losing billions of dollars.
 DaimlerChrysler rolled out a sunny roadster design study, the Dodge Demon, in the midst of speculation about whether it will sell its troubled Chrysler operations, and if so, to whom.
Still, the overall message from Geneva seemed to be that the future looks brighter -- and greener. Hybrids seem to be here to stay, even on a continent that has been slow to embrace them. The Geneva show featured hybrid concepts for sports cars, family cars and crossover utility vehicles. 
 The Geneva show is also known for being eclectic, and that description fit well this year. The halls of the Palexpo center were filled with electric cars, upright minivans, exotic supercars and bizarre vehicles that tried to be all of the above.
 Back-to-back press conferences -- often barely 10 minutes long -- kept the air thick with PR spin and manufactured excitement. Here are some highlights from the introductions this year:Audi A5 and S5: A battle among rich German two-doors is shaping up, and these coupes represent a salvo from Audi, aimed at the Mercedes-Benz CLK and the new BMW 3 Series. The Audis are based on an entirely new vehicle platform that will be the basis for future models. Both have strong, solid-looking lines but a fairly conservative appearance, provoking some heated debate in the press as to whether the cars are subtle and handsome or as dull as a Senate filibuster. The A5's standard engine is a 3.2-liter V-6; the S5 has a 350-horsepower 4.2-liter V-8. Both versions are due to arrive in the U.S. this fall.Dodge Demon: Pity the pretty Demon. Under any other circumstances, at any other auto show, this slick little roadster would have been guaranteed star status. The Demon adopts the look and attitude of its big brother, the 510-horsepower Dodge Viper, with an economical 2.4-liter 4-cylinder and proportions nearly identical to the nimble Mazda MX-5 Miata. But with DaimlerChrysler potentially on the verge of splitting up (and the short list of suitors to buy the Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brands growing shorter), the Demon looked like a four-wheel attempt to put on a brave face, rather than a real contender for series production.Toyota Hybrid X: Flush with success -- and cash from continued sales successes -- Toyota can afford to have some fun. The press conference for the Hybrid X was short on technical specifics, but this Toyota concept car still provided a welcome jolt of frivolity in an environmentally friendly package. Laurent Bouzige, a designer at Toyota's Europe Design Development offices in Nice, France, was responsible for the Hybrid X's interior. Mr. Bouzige explained that crystal-like rods serve as door handles and window switches; in addition, the headlights theoretically "communicate" with pedestrians and other drivers by alerting them to any quick maneuvers by the driver. While most of the technology is decades away -- and nearly all the technology in the Hybrid X is nonfunctional -- it doesn't take much crystal-ball gazing to deduce that the overall shape of the Hybrid X will influence the next-generation Prius hybrid.Mercedes-Benz C-Class: Depending on which model you were looking at on the Mercedes-Benz stand, the 2008 C-Class is everything from a rampaging racecar to a green machine with a fuel-sipping diesel engine. A wide range of 4, 6 and even 8-cylinder engines will be offered, though the American market will initially get only gasoline-powered V-6s. There is even an option of two different grill treatments: the traditional version has plenty of chrome and a proud Mercedes-tristar hood ornament, while the other is bolder but has less bling, featuring an oversize tristar at its center. C-Classes will arrive in the United States this summer with either 3-liter or 3.5-liter V-6s. A six-speed manual is available with the smaller engine, but the 3.5-liter V-6 comes only with a seven-speed automatic. High performance versions with powerful V-8s are also in the works.Honda Small Hybrid Sports Concept: Honda might as well have canceled its press conference, since most of the information about its car was included in its lengthy name. No technical details were provided other than the fact that the concept has a four-cylinder hybrid engine and is based on a "small-car platform." The strange combination of a wind-swept greenhouse, blunt bumpers and chunky fenders resulted in a design study almost as awkward as its name.BMW M3 Concept: BMW must have deemed its M3 Concept a hot commodity, since it placed a spinning propeller behind the M3's position on its stand. At the least, the breeze proved welcome relief on the stiflingly warm floor of the Palexpo center. Another welcome benefit, at least from a performance perspective, is the high-revving 4-liter V-8 engine producing more than 400 horsepower. The new M3 arrives in American showrooms early next year.Opel GTC Concept: The Opel nameplate does not mean much to most Americans, but it is General Motors' mainstream European brand and it has been busy updating its lineup and sharing the results with G.M.'s Saturn division. The muscular GTC Concept hints at the next-generation Opel Vectra, and possibly the next Vectra-based Saturn Aura. Boris Jacob, chief designer of advanced design at G.M. Europe, explained that the GTC Concept is meant to be "more fluid and emotional" than recent Opels. Details like the aluminum-trimmed tusklike grille openings could carry over to high-performance models. Opel's new arrangement with Saturn had no influence on the styling, G.M. insisted, though Mr. Jacob admitted that if the GTC appealed to American tastes, "that's perfect."Volvo V70 and XC 70: Now that Volvo has officially sent its youth-targeted C30 hatchback onto roads (at least in Europe), the company is free to get back to its roots. Big and boxy wagons are a Volvo hallmark, and there was a palpable sense of ease in knowing that the Swedish company is back to doing what it knows best. The V70 and XC70 wagons are safe, spacious and attractive and still boxy enough to appease Volvo purists. The V70 is equipped with a 235-horsepower 3.2-liter inline-6. The XC70 is basically the same car, albeit with a higher ride height, plastic body cladding and standard all-wheel drive. The XC70 arrives in the United States late this year, and the V70 will come early in 2008.Maserati GranTurismo: As the sheet covering the GranTurismo was pulled skyward, the smooth and aggressive lines -- designed by Pininfarina of Italy -- met with strong approval from spectators. A glance inside the cabin revealed rich red leather and tasteful applications of chrome and aluminum trim. The GranTurismo is powered by the same Ferrari-sourced 4.2-liter V-8 found in the luxurious Quattroporte sedan. Arriving in America later this year, the GranTurismo will cost roughly $110,000.Bentley Brooklands: Priced like a house and as long as a yacht, this imposing coupe carries a price tag of $350,000 and has a 530-horsepower 6.7-liter V-8 under its helipad-sized hood. As you'd expect of a car in this class, the interior has more wood and leather than an English billiard club. Only 550 are to be built, and just over 100 of those will be headed to America.

HEADLINE: Russian Prosecutors Search Office of Yukos's Audit Firm

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 9 

 BODY:
Russian prosecutors and Interior Ministry officers searched the Moscow office of the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers Friday in connection with its work with Yukos, the bankrupt oil company, and with PricewaterhouseCoopers's own tax filings. 
 Russian officials have compared the Yukos affair to the Enron scandal in the United States, with ominous implications for the firm.
A lawsuit filed by the Russian tax service last year questions PricewaterhouseCoopers's work on Yukos's tax filings, accusing the auditors of helping Yukos disguise profits. The tax service is seeking about $500,000 in fines; PricewaterhouseCoopers has denied any wrongdoing. 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers has been near the center of business growth and wealth in Russia, with a client list that includes the Russian central bank and large, powerful companies like the energy giant Gazprom. 
 The firm's client list for auditing and consulting includes 2,000 companies that as a whole generate more than 50 percent of Russia's gross domestic product, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
 The inspections began Friday morning, when two groups -- one from the prosecutor general's office, the other from the Interior Ministry -- arrived at the audit firm's complex. 
 The prosecutors gathered evidence for the criminal case against Yukos's former chief executive, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, according to Yekaterina Shapochka, a spokeswoman for PricewaterhouseCoopers, while the Interior Ministry officers searched for evidence in a tax case against PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
 Mr. Khodorkovsky is already serving an eight-year prison term for tax evasion and fraud; he now faces additional embezzlement charges. 
 In the case against PricewaterhouseCoopers, tax authorities sued for additional payments for 2002. The case concerned the firm's classification of expatriate workers as consultants rather than employees.
 PricewaterhouseCoopers lost at trial and two appeals were denied. The firm paid $11 million to the tax service. The company plans to appeal again, Ms. Shapochka said. 
 The spokesmen for the prosecutor general's office and the Interior Ministry declined to comment on the inspections.

HEADLINE: Investors Get a Break, but Some Lenders Absorb Blows

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
THE stock market took a breather after the wild ride a week ago, even in the face of plentiful economic data and more bad news on the subprime front. Radio stations agreed to a $12.5 million settlement with regulators, while a takeover battle brewed at Take-Two Interactive. 
 For all the anxiety this week about what Wall Street would do once investors saw the latest economic indicators, there was little excitement in the markets.
Stock prices were fairly subdued despite new data suggesting that inflation was rising and that both worker productivity and business activity in the service sector were slowing. 
 The markets also shrugged off comments by Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, that the chances of a recession this year were about one in three. Even the monthly jobs report from the Labor Department, a critical window on the health of the economy, moved the market little -- perhaps because the data was less than clear-cut. Job growth slowed from January's pace, but unemployment was down. JEREMY W. PETERS
 On Friday, all eyes will be on the Consumer Price Index, which is expected to show a slight increase in inflation.

HEADLINE: BUSH AND CHAVEZ SPAR AT DISTANCE OVER LATIN VISIT

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and LARRY ROHTER; Jim Rutenberg reported from Sao Paulo, and Larry Rohter from Buenos Aires.

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, March 9 

 BODY:
President Bush began the first full day of his weeklong trip to Latin America here on Friday promising job-creating aid but ended up competing for attention with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, who called the American visit an act of imperialism, adding, ''Gringo, go home!''
 ''I don't think America gets enough credit for trying to help improve people's lives,'' Mr. Bush said, speaking at a joint news conference with Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
But while President Bush pressed that point, President Chavez led an ''anti-imperialist'' rally at which he railed against what he called American hypocrisy and greed, and called Mr. Bush a ''political cadaver.'' 
 ''The Bush plan is ridiculous,'' Mr. Chavez said at the gathering in Buenos Aires, across the Rio de la Plata from Montevideo, Uruguay, Mr. Bush's next stop. ''He thinks he is Columbus, discovering poverty after seven years in power.''
 Mr. Bush kicked off his tour -- the longest Latin American trip of his presidency -- by completing an agreement with Mr. da Silva to increase the development of ethanol as a leading alternative to oil. Mr. Chavez's influence in the region stems from Venezuela's oil wealth, which he is using to build a loose coalition of left-leaning, anti-American countries. 
 But Mr. Chavez quickly shot back in an interview on a popular morning television program in Argentina, dismissing the ethanol plan as ''a crazy thing, off the wall.'' He accused the United States of trying ''to substitute the production of foodstuffs for animals and human beings with the production of foodstuffs for vehicles, to sustain the American way of life.''
 Bush administration officials have sought to play down Mr. Chavez, contending his influence is overblown by the news media and noting that South American polls show him with regional ratings no better than Mr. Bush's. President Bush refuses even to mention his name. 
 At the rally Friday night, Mr. Chavez said he had watched Mr. Bush on television in Brazil and concluded that ''he is afraid to say my name'' because Mr. Chavez's vision of ''21st century socialism'' is advancing in the region.
 ''Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, terrorism, security, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq,'' he said mockingly. ''He seems incapable of developing even a single idea.'' 
 In spite of the Chavez avoidance, though, Mr. Bush's trip seemed intended to counter the Venezuelan's anti-American message, signs of which have been visible everywhere.
 The police have clashed with thousands of protesters, many carrying signs calling Mr. Bush a murderer and a fascist. A group of Mayan priests in Guatemala said Friday that they would ''purify'' a sacred site of ''bad spirits'' after Mr. Bush visits it early next week.
 Security was intense, the most elaborate ever for a visiting head of state in Brazil, local officials said. Two helicopters hovered above Mr. Bush's extended motorcade here Friday, and his hotel was ringed with military sharpshooters and other security officers, though demonstrators burned an American flag close by. 
 The stadium rally Mr. Chavez attended was sponsored by union groups with ties to the Peronist government in Argentina, and a faction of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a human rights group led by Hebe de Bonafini.(She has expressed satisfaction at the Sept. 11 attacks, saying that Americans deserved a taste of their own medicine, and has also recently made anti-Semitic remarks.)
 Mr. da Silva's political party even lent its support to the people protesting Mr. Bush's visit to Brazil.
 Mr. Bush seemed annoyed when a Brazilian reporter asked whether he agreed that ''the U.S. really had its back turned to Latin America.'' 
 ''The characterization that our back has been turned is just, it is not borne out by the facts,'' Mr. Bush said, with his shoulders tightening and his voice turning stern. ''It may be a perception, but the facts dispel that, and that's why I've come.''
 He added, ''So my trip is to explain as clearly as I can that our nation is generous and compassionate, that when we see poverty, we care; that when we see illiteracy, we want to do something about it.''
 Mr. Bush's motorcade took him through the regional constituency that Mr. Chavez has been trying to court: people living in crushing poverty beside the thriving upper classes that benefit from increased trade with the United States.
 At one point, the president's limousine had only a few feet separating it on either side from the cement-walled, tin-roofed huts lining a road on the motorcade route. Bare-chested children and their parents gathered in doorways, on roofs and in windows as he passed, watched warily by Brazilian troops carrying submachine guns.
 In a country with a nominally leftist president in a region where the leftist philosophy is ascendant, especially among the poor, Mr. Bush referred repeatedly to United States efforts to address the yawning gap between the region's economic classes.
 At the news conference with Mr. da Silva, he stressed that he had doubled aid to the region to $1.6 billion annually -- though that figure will drop below $1.5 billion in the next fiscal year. Mr. Bush described it as ''social justice money'' that ultimately helped the poor.
 Speaking about the ethanol deal, he said, ''When you're growing your way out of dependence on oil, you're dependent upon people who work the land.'' He added that ''the distribution of wealth, the distribution of opportunity to farmers, particularly the smaller farmers in our respective countries, will enable the economy to be more on a firm foundation.''
 Under the ethanol agreement -- signed by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the Brazilian foreign minister, Celso Amorim, earlier on Friday -- the United States and Brazil will share technology to enhance ethanol production and push its development in other Latin American and Caribbean countries.
 But despite the agreement, some strains were visible between Mr. da Silva and Mr. Bush.
 Mr. da Silva is hopeful that the United States will reduce its tariff of 54 cents a gallon on Brazilian ethanol, which is made primarily from sugar cane -- a trade barrier that protects the American farmers who produce corn for ethanol.
 But when Mr. da Silva was asked about the possibility of eliminating the tariff, Mr. Bush jumped in. ''It's not going to happen,'' he said, noting that it is congressionally mandated through his term.
 Mr. da Silva joked: ''If I had that capacity for persuasion that you think I might have, who knows? I might have convinced President Bush to do so many other things that I couldn't even mention here.''
 The Brazilian president is caught in the middle of the fight between Mr. Chavez and Mr. Bush, balancing his desire to expand trade with the United States to staying true to Latin America's Mercosur trade alliance, which has Venezuela, among others, as a member.
 In his opening comments he pledged his allegiance to an integrated South America, seeming to send a message that Mr. Bush's fight with Mr. Chavez has nothing to do with him. ''We respect the political and economic options of each country'' in the region, he said.

HEADLINE: Politics Lite: No Sacrifice, No Substance, No Success

BYLINE: By RORY STEWART. 
Rory Stewart's latest book is ''The Prince of the Marshes and Other Occupational Hazards of a Year in Iraq.'' He runs the Turquoise Mountain Foundation in Kabul and is a guest columnist this month.

 BODY:
The accepted wisdom in British political circles is that Tony Blair won three elections by giving the British voters charisma and energy unfettered by dull or controversial policies. The Tories have now taken the lesson to heart. They are fighting back with feel-good, idea-light campaigns of their own, and it seems to be working. They are now significantly ahead in the polls. 
 This is not just electoral strategy. Many of them believe that we live in a postideological age, that there are no great questions anymore and that there can be no new solutions for domestic poverty or problems with immigration, energy or the economy. 
But why do people stand as politicians if they have no policies? Many politicians claim privately that they are simply concealing their policies until they are elected. It is more likely that when the winds of office change in their favor, they will find their faces frozen into an expression of affable inaction. The role of a modern politician is apparently to be likable, to tinker with existing institutions and to manage occasional crises. 
 Churchill has been replaced by Bertie Wooster.
 In Iraq, hundreds of thousands have died over the last few years and hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent by the U.S.-led coalition. The international system is fractured; the Islamic world is angry. Yet both major British political parties still refuse to admit the problem and instead tweak the current mission: withdraw some troops from Iraq, put a few more in Afghanistan.
 A million people took to London's streets to stop the invasion. Thirty million now think we should withdraw from Iraq. Whatever the correct policy, there should be a fierce practical and ideological political debate. But it is not happening in Parliament.
 Even though Britain is in a crisis, its other major policy issues seem to be approached with the same complacency. In many parts of the country, Asian Muslim and white communities live separate lives; people shun each other at school and in the streets and defend themselves in gangs. 
 This very wealthy country has pockets of shameful poverty. I have encountered a level of random hostility, aggression and bitterness in Scottish public housing that I have never seen in an Afghan village. British ''civilization'' is as tainted by this inequity as Rome by the Colosseum.
 The Labor Party continues to invest in child poverty, but three weeks ago a U.N. agency ranked Britain 18th out of 18 rich countries in a study of children's well-being. (The United States was 17th.) Islamist terror is answered with unprecedented levels of money and troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and comparatively little investment in intelligence and security, community relations and politics at home.
 In Kabul I work with a local government councilor called Aziz, who was a champion wrestler. For 40 years, he has dealt with war, pogroms and government. He is assessed by members of his community on whether he is generous to the poor, courageous even in the face of death, a powerful representative of their interests and able to keep his promises. He and they believe that leadership is an exercise in moral virtue and courage, that politics should be a noble profession and politicians virtuous. A British voter might think that is naive. But I believe Aziz is right.
 It is patronizing to assume that voters can't handle demanding, imaginative and risky policies. More Britons voted for the contestants on the TV programs ''Big Brother'' and ''Pop Idol'' last year than in the national elections. But the way to persuade people to vote is to make politics less, not more, like ''Big Brother.'' 
 We are as reluctant to acknowledge the popularity of the Taliban as we are to acknowledge poverty in Glasgow. We are as reluctant to believe in the Iraqis' ability to build a nation without us as we are to believe that our citizens will make sacrifices to prevent global warming. Courage, honesty about problems and faith in the population is as necessary domestically as it is abroad. Our failure in these areas explains our hubristic confidence internationally and our cynicism and lack of ambition at home.Maureen Dowd is on leave.

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, March 9 

 BODY:
The European Union approved a compromise agreement on Friday that would make Europe the world's leader in the fight against climate change but would also allow some of Europe's most polluting countries to limit their environmental goals.
 Issuing a challenge to the United States, China and India to match European ambitions in the battle against global warming, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany called on the world to follow the European Union's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2020. She said the bloc's 27 members would commit to a 30 percent reduction if other nations followed suit. 
The plan goes beyond the 35-nation Kyoto Protocol, which requires industrial nations to reduce the emission of global-warming gases by an average of 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. Major European Union economies had already committed to do better than that, promising to decrease greenhouse gases by 8 percent in that time.
 The accord by the European Union -- unveiled after two days of heated negotiations and hailed by President Jacques Chirac of France as ''a great moment in European history'' -- will require the bloc to derive a fifth of its energy from renewable sources like wind and solar power by 2020. Renewables account for less than 7 percent of the energy mix used by the Europeans. 
 The bloc will also be required to fuel 10 percent of its cars and trucks on biofuels made from plants by 2020.
 Mrs. Merkel said the agreement would help the European Union become a model for the rest of the world. ''This text really gives European Union policies a new quality and will establish us as a world pioneer,'' she said. 
 She plans to press the issue at a June summit meeting in Germany of the Group of 8 leading industrial nations, to try to push the world's biggest polluters, including the United States, China and India, to tackle climate change. 
 Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who has struggled to use his influence in Washington to press the Bush administration to be more diligent in fighting global warming, called it a ''groundbreaking'' deal. ''It gives Europe a clear leadership position on this crucial issue facing the world,'' he said. 
 Still, the agreement faces daunting challenges to transform lofty ambitions into reality, environment analysts warned. Under pressure from several countries of the former Soviet bloc, which rely heavily on cheap coal and oil for their energy and are reluctant to switch to more costly, environmentally friendly alternatives, the European Union agreed that individual targets would be allowed for each of the 27 members to meet the renewable energy goal. 
 That means that some of the worst polluters in the fast-growing economies of East Europe will face less stringent targets than their Western European counterparts.
 Many of the eight former Communist nations that joined the European Union in May 2004 are far behind the rest of the union in developing renewable energy. Poland, for example, obtains more than 90 percent of its energy for heating from coal. 
 The European Commission, which drafts legislation for the European Union, will be charged with coming up with individual countries' targets in coordination with those nations.
 Jose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, and Mrs. Merkel acknowledged that there would be difficult political and legal wrangling ahead, given that countries would have to approve binding renewable targets set for them by the European Commission.
 European Union lawyers still have to draw up the detailed rules specifying how the agreement will be enforced, but the bloc's officials said the ultimate sanction for countries that violated the targets would be prosecution at the European Court of Justice and the imposition of heavy fines.
 In a nod to Mr. Chirac, who lobbied hard for the European Union to include nuclear power as a noncarbon energy alternative, the agreement acknowledges the role of nuclear power, saying it will be taken into account when the European Commission determines national renewable energy targets. 
 That will help France meet its renewable energy goals. The inclusion of nuclear energy as an energy alternative met stiff resistance from Austria, Denmark and Ireland, where nuclear energy is regarded with deep suspicion. 
 Some European business leaders fear overly ambitious environmental goals could harm European industry.
 Environmental groups generally welcomed the deal. But Friends of the Earth, the Brussels- based lobbying group, called the agreement ''timid and tentative.''

HEADLINE: How the Young Poor Measure Poverty in Britain: Drink, Drugs and Their Time in Jail

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

DATELINE: WYTHENSHAWE, England 

 BODY:
Wandering the streets after dusk in this endless housing project, the five teenagers said they were not troubled by the turns their lives had taken so far. Not by the absent fathers, the mothers on welfare, the drugs, the arrests, the incarcerations, the wearying inevitability of it all. 
 ''When you live in Wythenshawe, you don't expect any better,'' said David Williams, a 17-year-old who says he dropped out of school at 14, is high much of the time, steals when he can and has been arrested too many times to count. He was not posturing. He is not a gang member or a hardened criminal seeking street cred -- he was simply giving the unsentimental facts.
The housing projects in Wythenshawe (pronounced WITH-en-shah) represent an extreme pocket of social deprivation and alienation. But the problems here -- a breakdown in families, an absence of respect for authority, the prevalence of drugs, drunkenness, truancy, vandalism and petty criminality -- are common across Britain. 
 And while Prime Minister Tony Blair has made addressing poverty and so-called antisocial behavior one of his main priorities, his critics say there is little to show after 10 years in office and a blizzard of new programs. 
 In February, Britain scored at the bottom among 21 industrialized countries in a Unicef report that used 40 indicators, like relative poverty, health and family relationships, to measure children's well-being. (The United States was next to last.) 
 Last year a paper published by the Institute for Public Policy Research, a progressive study group, concluded that Britain's young people were the worst-behaved in Europe, spending less time with their parents, drinking and fighting more, and trying drugs and sex earlier than their counterparts across the Continent. 
 Sociologists, politicians and children's advocates have argued endlessly about why Britain's youths are so troubled. Drinking is part of it: consumption among youths who drink has been rising steadily for 20 years. British youths are ranked the third-worst binge drinkers in Europe, behind those in Denmark and Ireland. In a survey last year, 25 percent of British 15-year-olds said they had been drunk more than 20 times in the previous 12 months. 
 The Institute for Public Policy Research report said, too, that young Britons' tendency to spend time with their peers rather than with adults was robbing them of even basic social skills. In Britain, 45 percent of 15-year-old boys spend most of their evenings out with friends; in France, the figure is 17 percent.
 ''Because they don't have that structured interaction with adults, it damages their life chances,'' said Nick Pearce, the institute's director. ''They are not learning how to behave, how to get on in life, as they need to.'' 
 A third factor is the growing gulf between rich and poor in an increasingly affluent society. According to the advocacy group Save the Children, although Britain has the world's fourth-largest economy, it also has one of the worst rates of child poverty in the industrialized world, with 3.4 million children, more than one in four, living in poverty, and about a million, or nearly 10 percent, living in severe poverty. 
 With poverty comes crime and violence, much of it committed by youths against youths. In 2003, the public policy report said, 35 percent of British children aged 10 to 15 were victims of crime; the figure increased to 59 percent the next year for children from deprived areas. 
 Defending his record, Mr. Blair said recently that 700,000 children had been raised out of poverty since he took office in 1997. ''I do not believe there is a general social breakdown,'' he said.
 He acknowledged, however, the existence of a persistent underclass of ''severely dysfunctional'' families ''who are shut out of society's mainstream.'' 
 These people, he said, are neither helped by the extra money the government has invested in social programs, nor affected by new law-enforcement measures intended to address the antisocial behavior that people across Britain identify as one of their biggest concerns.
 Mr. Blair's government has introduced a bevy of directives aimed at stopping activity that disrupts neighborhoods -- vandalism, petty thievery, harassment, even persistently loud music -- but does not necessarily warrant criminal prosecution. 
 The orders forbid youths, say, from going into certain neighborhoods, meeting with certain people, going into town without their parents, staying out past a certain time, harassing their neighbors.
 But Wythenshawe has its share of residents seemingly immune to government intervention. 
 ''Every kid here has nought to do,'' said David Williams, the local youth. ''Everyone does crime. Everyone's got no money. They live in council houses and are on benefits, and the mums don't have money to give the kids, and so they go stealing. Everything of value, you have to bolt down.'' 
 Built just after World War II to house Britain's poor, the projects here are now a series of neighborhoods covering 10.9 square miles and taking in more than 66,000 people. In its four most deprived neighborhoods, some 30 percent of the residents of working age are considered ''economically inactive,'' neither holding jobs nor looking for them. Close to half have left high school without passing the exams needed to graduate. Almost half the town falls within the poorest 5 percent of communities in England. 
 Racism is not an issue: nearly 95 percent of the residents are white. Weapons here run more to broken bottles and knives than to guns. 
 Nor is Wythenshawe particularly run-down or forbidding, as housing projects go. Most residents live in two-story single-family houses whose small yards out front give the area a vaguely suburban air. Under programs encouraging private ownership, more residents are buying their own homes. 
 A public-private partnership aimed at regenerating the area has invested some $:30 million ($57 million) in community facilities in the past three years, said Angela Harrington, the manager for regeneration in South Manchester. 
 Things are improving in the town center and in the eastern part of town. But in the rougher areas, there is still a sense of chaos outside the residents' front doors. After dark, the streets belong to the young. 
 Bringing home her groceries recently, Jane Leach, a 46-year-old caregiver for the elderly, described a typical weekend evening on the small grassy area that serves as a park of sorts between two rows of houses on her street. The youths start coming after 6, she said, dozens of them, boys and girls, mostly in their teens. They get drunk, take drugs, harass the residents, steal cars, urinate and defecate in the gardens, smash beer bottles on doorsteps, fight, pass out. 
 When she tries to intervene, Ms. Leach said, the youths yell abuse at her. When she tells them to get off her car, they tell her there is nowhere else to sit. Recently, youths slashed every tire on 12 cars up and down the street, she said. When her partner was smashed in the face by a 14-year-old, Ms. Leach said, the police took 45 minutes to respond. 
 ''They've got no respect at all for anybody,'' she said. 
 The street is subject to a so-called dispersal order forbidding young people to congregate in groups larger than three or four. But the police have told her, she said, that it is better for the youths to be in one place so they don't rampage separately through the neighborhood. 
 On one occasion, an officer said she was loathe to step in because there was no one to back her up, Ms. Leach said. ''I said, 'Who do wehave to call -- the army?' '' 
 When children chronically miss school, many localities require their parents to attend parenting classes, sometimes threatening them with prosecution if the truancy persists. Families with problems that run through the generations can in some places qualify for regular home visits from workers who teach them the basics of daily life: how to make sure everyone gets up on time and has breakfast; how to cook and sit down to a meal; what to do when a child misbehaves. 
 Under a new program, a handful of the most troubled families in some areas, including Manchester, are removed from their homes and placed in residential facilities, along with other problem families, where they are taught skills and the structure to cope with family life and the world outside. The programs have a high success rate for those who take part, but they are very expensive and labor-intensive, reaching only a few families. 
 In Wythenshawe, David Williams and his friends, out after dark, spend much of their time wandering the streets. 
 They said they had put their vandalizing and terrorizing days behind them. ''That's kid stuff, something I did when I was 10 or 13,'' David said. Sometimes they go to a friend's house, where they have been experimenting with various forms of rap and garage music that they post on their MySpace Web page.
 They said they did not see their families much. Dinner is usually bought from a local chippie, a fish-and-chips shop. ''Half the time you don't really know where your mother is,'' said Jeremy Taylor, 17. He said his mother preferred him to be out of the house, saying she needed the peace and quiet. 
 Another 17-year-old, who identified himself as Moe, said that when he was 10, his father left and now lives in another part of Manchester. Moe added that he recently spent four months in prison for burglary and that it was not so bad: he saw it as almost a home away from home. ''I knew a few people there who helped me,'' he said.
 As they talked, they were joined on the sidewalk by 18-year-old Darren Buckby, identically dressed in the ubiquitous street uniform of a warm-up suit and hooded jacket, but almost an exotic figure here: he has a job. He works as an electrician for, of all things, the police department. 
 (He also has an antisocial-behavior order issued by a police officer he irritated one day, he said. The order forbids him to go down a particular street in the neighborhood, but he said he had never bothered to abide by it.) 
 The job takes him away from the streets where he grew up, but not far enough. ''I would love to move out of Wythenshawe,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Users of the Javits Center Criticize Its Expansion Plan

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Many of the companies that use the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center are openly criticizing the long-awaited plan to expand it, saying the current scheme would provide less new exhibition and meeting space than expected, would increase the cost of running trade shows and could discourage visitors from going there.
 Executives from the companies say that the $1.8 billion project, first authorized by the State Legislature in 2004, has turned into the ''incredible shrinking expansion plan,'' as architects and officials have reconfigured elements to stay within budget.
The complaints from trade show managers and executives from the New York International Auto Show, the center's largest user, come as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a supporter of the current plan, is set to meet on Monday to discuss the project's fate with Gov. Eliot Spitzer and Senator Charles E. Schumer, a longtime critic of the expansion plan. 
 If Mr. Spitzer, who is expected to complete a review of the project in early April, calls for a full redesign of the expansion project, it could cause long delays and set off a bitter dispute with the Bloomberg administration. The mayor has promoted the project as a keystone in the redevelopment of the Far West Side.
 The dispute over the current plan also reveals a split between trade show operators and the hotel industry, which opposes any further delays in the project. 
 But state and city officials say it is unclear whether Mr. Spitzer will ultimately seek to modify the proposal or abandon it altogether and build over the railyards instead. More likely, he may seek to extend the expansion one block to the south of the existing center, or one block farther north than planned, to the south side of 41st Street. Each of those alternatives, however, carries its own set of problems and additional costs.
 ''Nobody I know is enthusiastic about the current plan,'' Senator Schumer said. ''The governor's review may let us get a lot closer to the perfect solution.'' 
 In Albany last week, Patrick J. Foye, the state's top economic development official, called the current plan an ''extraordinarily expensive'' endeavor for only 300,000 additional square feet of exhibition space.
 But Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, a leading proponent of the current plan, said that there were no ''perfect solutions,'' given budget constraints, the need to operate the center during construction and other considerations. 
 ''We respect their right to review the project and are eagerly participating,'' Mr. Doctoroff said. ''Hopefully, they'll conclude, as we have, that the best alternative is to go north to 40th Street and to go vertical with the building.''
 Critics say the current plan would result in a flawed building, much like the original Javits Center, which opened in 1986. The center, which sits along 11th Avenue between 34th and 38th Streets, now has 760,000 square feet of exhibit space and 30,000 square feet of meeting rooms, a size that everyone agrees is too small. It is one of the most heavily used centers in the country and perhaps the only one to have generated an operating surplus, although a modest one. Current plans call for extending the center to the south side of 40th Street.
 The expense of the project has escalated because of rising construction costs and a security plan devised by the Police Department, which planners say would cost about $100 million. As a result, officials have pared the Javits expansion over the last year by nearly a fifth, reducing the total amount of meeting and exhibit space to 1.05 million square feet, from 1.3 million as first planned. 
 But show managers complain about the vertical nature of the expansion and say that trade shows and conventions require more space devoted exclusively to meeting rooms adjacent to the exhibit space, both of which, they add, are much smaller than what they had been promised. They delivered a blistering critique at meetings on Feb. 21 and 22 sponsored by Javits Center officials and the architects.
 ''The current plan is disappointing,'' said Jeff Little, whose company produces many of the largest shows at the Javits. ''Although initially consulted, the actual users have not been given any role in the inevitable trade-offs until very recently.'' 
 Critics have also questioned the decision to move the Javits Center's current truck marshaling yard from the south end of the complex, between 33rd and 34th Streets, to what would be a multilevel garage and security center. They say doing so will drive up costs and take up what should be exhibit space.
 ''It's not a productive plan,'' said John O'Connell, chief operating officer of Freeman, a general contractor that moves most of the trade shows in and out of the center. ''But I continue to support the expansion, and I appreciate the new openness of the Spitzer administration.''
 Mr. Foye, the state economic development official, confirmed yesterday that he had met recently with a group that included Mr. Little, Mr. O'Connell and executives from Reed Exhibitions and the New York auto show. According to participants, the show managers said they were willing to contribute toward the project's cost through a tax on revenues.
 ''The customer is king,'' Mr. Foye said. ''We're giving significant weight to the views of prospective users and customers of Javits.''
 The governor's review of what is essentially a state project has sent shudders through the hotel trade association and City Hall. The Bloomberg administration, which like the state is contributing $350 million, rezoned the Far West Side for high-rise development in 2005 and wants to convey a sense of momentum that will accelerate development of what it says will be a huge commercial and residential district.
 Executives from the hotel industry, which has agreed to a $1.50-a-night hotel tax to pay for its $650 million share of the cost, told Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Foye last month that they did not want any further delays and were unlikely to accept a proposal to increase the tax to $2.50 a night.
 Hotel operators are more interested in trade shows and conventions that attract out-of-town visitors who will rent rooms, attend Broadway shows and shop in the city, than in events like the auto show, which they say attracts huge local crowds but not many people who book hotels.
 Mark Schienberg, president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, called the current plan ''disastrous.'' He said the auto show attracted about 1.2 million people in 2006 and generated $181 million in spending, including more than $26 million at hotels and restaurants. 
 ''Governor Spitzer had done the right thing,'' Mr. Schienberg said, ''by saying, 'Let's open this up and have meetings with the exhibitors.' ''

HEADLINE: Glass Slippers? Old Hat

BYLINE: By JUDITH WARNER. 
Judith Warner is the author of ''Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety'' and a contributing columnist for TimesSelect. She is a guest Op-Ed columnist this month.

 BODY:
We were laid out on the couch the other weekend, stopped in our tracks by an unforeseen afternoon broadcast of ''Maid in Manhattan,'' when an important moment of sociological revelation arose.
 Ralph Fiennes's character, the Senate candidate Christopher Marshall, and Jennifer Lopez's Marisa Ventura, a hotel maid mistaken by Marshall for a socialite, locked eyes for a searing moment. ''I only came to tell you that this, you and me, can't go anywhere beyond this evening,'' J. Lo said.
''Well then,'' purred the man best known for his impersonation of a sadistic Nazi, ''you should've worn a different dress.'' 
 ''Why'd he say that?'' asked my daughter Emilie, who is nearly 7.
 ''He said that,'' I answered, ''because he is arrogant. He's a man who's used to getting his way. He figures that he knows better than she does why she's wearing that dress.'' 
 ''Tradition! Tradition!'' Nine-year-old Julia was booming upstairs, simultaneously embroidering, dressing the dog, cleaning her room, listening to Bill Harley and practicing for her school musical.
 ''It's just a fairy tale, Em,'' my husband, Max, said with a sigh. ''A Cinderella story.'' 
 ''A stupid Cinderella,'' she countered. But nothing then -- not Monopoly, not War, not even a go at the hypertoxic crystal-making kit -- could make her peel her eyes away.
 I shouldn't have worried. And I could have spared her the lesson in dime-store feminism. Truth is, in the real world, the fantasy of a highly successful man swooping down to make off with a winsome, wide-eyed maid is pretty well dead. Instead, according to recent sociological research, what these alpha males are doing is marrying equally high-octane women.
 It's the latest twist in what social scientists call ''assortative mating'' -- like marrying like, in normal-people-speak -- and it's been going on pretty much forever. But until recently, according to the sociologist Barbara Risman at the Council on Contemporary Families, the phenomenon played out in terms of race, ethnicity or the social class of origin. ''It never before meant men and women were choosing each other or were like each other in terms of achievement level in the work world,'' she said. 
 The coming together of equally well-educated and successful people can be very good, particularly when worldly ambition doesn't fly to extremes and the partnership translates into more equal task-sharing and co-parenting. But the mating of like-wired colleagues and college pals is raising some questions as well. 
 Some economists worry that the concentration of income in high-achieving two-earner homes is aggravating the wealth gap. Some evolutionary psychologists say that pumping up certain kids' genes for intelligence will increase the achievement gap (by creating supersmart kids with an even more unfair advantage than their smart parents had). 
 In Britain, Simon Baron-Cohen, the Autism Research Center director at the University of Cambridge, postulates that assortative mating among people with great skills in understanding and building systems, like engineers and economists, may be linked to the greater numbers of autistic children. Similar hypotheses have been floated around to explain the increased and earlier incidence of bipolar disorder and anorexia (too many perfectionists marrying perfectionists, too little ''hybrid vigor'').
 This is all speculation. For our family, though, the message is clear: if Emilie persists in her declared career path of being ''a artist,'' she isn't likely to be swept off her feet by an investment banker and to spend her life working within the velvet bondage of having him pay her Bergdorf's bills. She's more likely to marry a guy she meets in art school, whose economic prospects will be as dim as her own. 
 All that bodes badly for a future in which she was supposed to grow up and take care of her parents, writers who bonded over their mutual dislike of Thomas Wolfe -- ''O rock, o leaf, o pretzel,'' Max wrote to me -- and over their shared ambition of reading as many books as possible while living as expensively as possible and working, perhaps, not at all. 
 Julia plans to spend her life swimming with dolphins. It just goes to show: if you're going to marry your soul mate, better beware of the content of your soul. Correction: In my last column, the names Clare Boothe Luce and Ted Sorensen were misspelled (shades of idiocracy!).

HEYDAY
 By Kurt 
 Andersen. 
 622 pp. 
 Random House. $26.95.
It perhaps strikes anyone who has read an ambitious historical novel -- and certainly strikes anyone who has had the audacity to try to write one -- that the enterprise represents the triumph of hope over experience, a suspension of hard-won, armoring caution, a Peter-Pannish faith in ... well, faith. How daunting it must be to get it right: facts and artifacts, syntax and slang, costumes and customs, fads and prices, conventional wisdoms and bright ideas. And if such a novel were to aspire to be a bulging monster, teeming with extravagantly vivid characters going about their coincidentally intersecting lives with amplified voices, wearing garish clothes, committing melodramatic vices, loving (and hating) with the fervor of char-
 acters from a comic opera, then such fiction would seem perfectly ill-suited to a writer and observer known heretofore as the wised-up, sardonic, founding co-editor of the late Spy magazine. As a columnist (for New York magazine) and a radio commentator, Kurt Andersen should react to the emotions described by gee whiz like a fox to a bunny wabbit. 
 Andersen's previous novel -- ''Turn of the Century'' (1999) -- is, like ''Heyday,'' lengthy and episodic, but it owes its flensing spirit to the examples of Tom Wolfe's ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' and ''The Way We Live Now,'' by Anthony Trollope It keeps a sharp eye focused on hypocrisy, self-interest, preening, sharp practice and overreaching.
 ''Heyday,'' by contrast, cries huzzah for over-the-top ambition. It's a band-concert of a novel, a parade in honor of overreaching. Set in 1848 -- that hugely eventful year in Europe, the pre-Civil War United States, Mexico and the California gold fields -- it never quits exclaiming, Gosh! How about that! Who'd a thunk it? It's a mighty busy and messy story, jumping among the urban settings of Gotham, Paris, London, Chicago and San Francisco; evil is afoot and brutality the quotidian, but ''Heyday'' is also a sweet book, with a tropism toward redemption and happy endings.
 The protagonist, connected to every subordinate character by sometimes flimsy networks of chance, is Benjamin Knowles, younger son of a newly rich Lancashire mill owner and entrepreneur. During his visit to a friend in Paris during the 1848 uprising that brought down the July Monarchy, the friend is believed to have been killed, and Benjamin is inadvertently an accomplice to the death of a militiaman. A principal weapon used during the mortal mayhem is the beak of a stuffed penguin, which suggests why at least one advance review of ''Heyday'' has described the novel as a ''parody'' of Victorian melodrama.
 It is in fact an homage to Dickens, Dumas and Hugo, reviving as a central plot device the relentless quest of Inspector Javert, in ''Les Miserables,'' for the hide of Jean Valjean. Benjamin is hunted throughout ''Heyday'' by the elder brother of the slain militiaman, Drumont, a Corsican rumored to be the bastard son of Napoleon by his prostitute mother. Prostitution -- in New York and San Francisco -- provides a wealth of material and moral calculus for Andersen's characters, the most successful of whom is Polly Lucking, a social-climbing nascent feminist, part-time unsuccessful actress and part-time wildly successful hooker in a New York brothel.
 Benjamin, fleeing from Paris to England, and from England sailing to New York to seek adventure and fortune in the New World -- looking for a ''permanent place to live in a more suitably ... American way. Whatever that meant'' -- meets Polly (unprofessionally) and falls in love. This brings him together with Polly's brother, Duff, a survivor of the Mexican War suffering so acutely from post-traumatic stress disorder that he is not only a firefighter but a firebug, not only a sentimental idealist but a murderer. None of this, believe me, is played for laughs, although New York's 19th-century brutality and coarseness approach comedy in their grotesqueness. (A noteworthy passage regards a fellow firefighter, Fatty Freeborn, a bully and rapist, who eats for dinner the sheep he has loved to death during the cocktail hour. Ameliorating this bestiality are two episodes detailing the attempted rescue of ''imperiled pets'' -- a puppy bobbing downstream in one scene, a kitty trapped in a burning whorehouse in the other.)
 Benjamin also falls in with Timothy Skaggs, friend to Duff and Polly, a Dartmouth dropout and black-sheep son of a New Hampshire mayor, an alcoholic daguerreotype photographer and journalist, a friend of Walt Whitman, who roams New York on the lookout for all that is novel and unexpected. This gives Andersen, seeing omnisciently through the eyes of his principal characters, opportunity to observe what's astir, what has just been invented, what is in and what out. I was once asked by a grade-school kid whether toilet paper had been invented when I was a little boy; in much the same spirit of wonder, Andersen -- generally through Benjamin or Timothy Skaggs --is besotted with the products of research masking as observation. Thus, when Skaggs was a boy ''friction matches did not exist. ... Photography was a fantasy. There were no one-penny newspapers, no private shops selling meats and fruits, no baseball, and precious few theaters or foreigners.''
 Andersen is so keen to observe the wonders of his world that his characters seem able to see as clearly at night as at noon, and if his novel's back is broken by the weight of its minutiae, its flow dammed by the debris of its detail, there is something moving, a stirring spirit, in the energy of its amazement. Like her author, Polly Lucking is agog at what's on display at a New York department store; ''she did enjoy looking at gold.''
 Gold, and the early days of the California gold rush, dominate the final third or so of ''Heyday'' (a terrific title, with its multiple exclamatory suggestions dominated by an exhortation). Polly and Benjamin, Duff and Timothy -- leading a wagon train of trailing characters, including the avenging hound Drumont -- find their misadventuresome ways to the golden rivers of Northern California. There the four cobble together a kind of commune, and pan laboriously for just enough precious grit and pebbles to keep them at it.
 ''Heyday'' tries also to be a novel of ideas, gamely providing mouthpieces to test theories of political unrest, economy and evolution, free will versus security. Darwin walks on as a character, and Engels enjoys the enthusiasm of Benjamin. Manifest Destiny is deplored, the notion of the Noble Savage mocked and embraced. Again and again Duff specifies that ''destruction and creation are the cycle of life.'' Andersen declared in a recent interview that our ''elective'' invasion of Iraq was on his mind as he invoked our earlier war against Mexico, and that the ''commune stuff'' in his novel ''reminded me of the late '60s.''
 But ''Heyday'' roars awake, unexpectedly, while Polly and Benjamin drudge wordlessly together on the river, panning ''with their labor of 20 minutes'' a ''decent week's wage'' back in the world. ''There were still fortunes to be made in California. But now luck had become occasional and scarce, like luck in most places at most times.'' Now their output, pretty impressive despite the absurdly inflated cost of living, wasin decline. ''Yet Ben had Polly, thank heavens. Hadn't he? She was all that he required. Wasn't she?''
 In the end, the answer to both questions will be yes, in thunder. The dead shall be raised, the evildoers vanquished. But those questions will resonate, to Andersen's credit.

THE GOSPEL OF FOOD
 Everything You Think You Know 
 About Food Is Wrong.
 By Barry Glassner.
 285 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins
 Publishers. $25.95.
Barry GLASSNER has made it his business to set credulous consumers of mass media straight. His best-known book, ''The Culture of Fear,'' took apart several stories poised somewhere between urban myth and the lead item on the evening news, arguing that according to statistics, teenage moms aren't really tearing up the fabric of society, road rage is less of a problem than lightning strikes, and gun control, not building more prisons, might be the best way of stopping violent crime.
 This time around, Glassner, a sociologist at the University of Southern California, takes the same approach to what we eat. In ''The Gospel of Food: Everything You Think You Know About Food Is Wrong,'' he promises to blow the lid off your dinner. 
 But such big promises can be difficult to fulfill. And although his book delivers some convincing arguments, Glassner also makes many points that aren't all that shocking. Are you surprised to learn that claims on food packaging can be misleading? That frozen peas are often better than fresh? That nutrition research ignores culinary pleasure?
 While doing his own research, Glassner spends time with big-name chefs and interviews food writers and critics. His equally unsurprising conclusion? Many restaurant reviewers who strive for anonymity do get recognized. And they and other well-connected 
 diners often receive better treatment than the rest of us.
 He offers his own experience as proof: ''At one of L.A.'s best-known restaurants, where I've enjoyed some of the best meals of my life while dining with influential food writers, when I have dined as a nobody I've been seated at tables in hallways and served lukewarm, overcooked food.'' This won't be news even to those who've gotten the worst table at the Olive Garden, let alone a restaurant Glassner should have had the backbone to name.
 But like a magician with a long act and a few great tricks, Glassner makes it worth sitting through the obvious sleight of hand to get to the good parts. In his book's strongest section, he argues against the conventional wisdom on the causes of obesity: that we eat too much and don't exercise enough. A master at the art of dissecting research, he points out that the obesity epidemic -- and he's not entirely convinced there is one, or that being overweight is taking years off people's lives -- came about through a complex mix of genetic predisposition, economic hardship and antismoking campaigns.
 Of all the possible causes on his list, lower income levels are the most intriguing. Poor people and some ethnic groups are, Glassner writes, disproportionately overweight, and during the decades when their obesity rates shot up, so did their rates of economic hardship and insecurity. As a result, more people had higher stress levels, causing the body to produce less of a growth hormone that reduces fat deposits and revs up metabolism even as it yields more ''stress hormones'' that ''provoke cravings for soothing substances like glazed doughnuts and chocolate fudge ice cream.''
 Poverty also leads to binge eating. Some weeks the fridge is empty, but when there's enough money to fill it ''the food-insecure'' may eat too many calorie-rich indulgences. ''Over time,'' Glassner writes, ''their bodies adapt to the alternations by converting more of what they eat to body fat.'' Combine that group with the nation's dieters, also prone to weight gain through binge eating, and common explanations about the causes of obesity -- the decline of the family meal, fast-food advertising, selling sodas in schools, a lack of exercise -- begin to seem less obvious.
 Along these same lines, Glassner makes a convincing defense of the fast-food industry. (His exploration of the vital place of the hamburger in American food culture could be the basis for a book all by itself.) And he has some fun with an obnoxious subgroup of the culinary world he calls food adventurers, people who populate online communities dedicated to ethnic cuisine and who race to be first to ''discover'' places where they can indulge in truly ''authentic'' food. 
 ''Were authenticity buffs to base their beliefs on what appears regularly on tables in homes rather than on hearsay from other food adventurers and stagings by self-interested restaurateurs,'' Glassner writes, ''they would have to revise their views fairly radically. They would have to give up some of the popular dishes in ethnic restaurants, for a start, because in their countries of origin these are special-occasion foods eaten primarily at festivals and holidays, or in homes of the rich. In most places in the world, everyday cooking is exactly as the name implies -- pedestrian.''
 Despite these adept challenges to conventional thinking, Glassner's chapters often suffer from out-of-date material and a loose observational approach based on what sometimes seem like personal hunches. He points out that trade associations for commodities like almonds and olive oil exploit consumer desire to find foods that promise extraordinary health benefits. He mocks the National Watermelon Promotion Board for piggybacking on positive news about the antioxidant properties of lycopene, found in high levels in cooked tomatoes and in watermelons. (''What a lovely irony,'' he notes. ''A fruit long associated in the U.S. with lower-caste African-Americans gets recast in its marketing materials as an ideal food for white folks.'') And he seems shocked that the reality-television show ''The Restaurant,'' starring the New York chef Rocco DiSpirito, was largely staged. I'm shocked that anyone remembers the show at all.
 It's too bad ''The Gospel of Food'' is so uneven, because we do need to approach what we eat with a side dish of skepticism and a dose of clearheaded thinking. Too often, though, Glassner commits the same sin he sees in others -- taking the pleasure out of food.

A FAMILY DAUGHTER, by Maile Meloy. (Scribner, $14.) Meloy's first novel, ''Liars and Saints,'' concerned four generations of a California family named the Santerres, whose Roman Catholic matriarch, Yvette, schemed to raise her teenage daughter's child as her own. ''A Family Daughter'' continues the intricately plotted family saga, but with a twist: it treats ''Liars and Saints'' as a semiautobiographical novel written by Yvette's granddaughter, Abby. Meloy follows Abby from the age of 7, in 1969, to her success as a young novelist, recasting the details of this intensely complicated family. 
Our reviewer, Jeff Giles, called Meloy's many subplots ''rich, moving and full of human comedy.''COBRA II: The Inside Story of the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq, by Michael R. Gordon and Bernard E. Trainor. (Vintage, $16.) Gordon, the chief military correspondent for The New York Times, and Trainor, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant general and former correspondent for The Times, chronicle the crimes, follies and misfortunes of the Iraq war until the summer of 2003. (Gordon and Trainor also wrote, in 1995, a widely acclaimed book about the 1991 Persian Gulf war, ''The Generals' War.'') '' 'Cobra II' is everything that the Bush administration's plan for the war was not,'' Jacob Heilbrunn wrote here. ''It is meticulously organized, shuns bluff and bombast for lapidary statements, and is largely impervious to attack.'' In OVERTHROW: America's Century of Regime Change From Hawaii to Iraq (Times/Holt, $15), Stephen Kinzer, a former Times correspondent, surveys the history of forcible regime changes by the United States and its local allies, starting with the undermining of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893, passing through Cuba (1898), Iran (1953) and elsewhere, and ending with present-day Iraq.LEAVING HOME, by Anita Brookner. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.95.) Her name evokes Jane Austen's matchmaking Emma Woodhouse, but the heroine of Brookner's novel more resembles those Henry James characters who are destined to observe life from a distance. At 26, Emma Roberts fears turning into her sad, solitary mother; trying to break free from their claustrophobic relationship, Emma flits between London and Paris, forging a tenuous friendship with an adventurous woman who has her own family problems.NEW ART CITY: Manhattan at Mid-Century, by Jed Perl. (Vintage, $18.95.) Perl, the art critic for The New Republic, brilliantly evokes the intense, eclectic world that New York artists created for themselves by the 1950s. ''New Art City'' covers the giants of Abstract Expressionism (Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock) as well as a variety of independent-minded successors (Fairfield Porter, Donald Judd). In the Book Review, John Updike praised Perl as ''a fiercely fluent word-spinner ... laden with a staggering knowledge of American artists and their critics.''MONEY, A MEMOIR: Women, Emotions, and Cash, by Liz Perle. (Picador, $14.) In this cautionary tale, Perle exposes her own financial fears while profiling dozens of other women, exploring the anxiety, embarrassment and guilt money causes them. (The book opens as she's confronting a divorce and insolvency, even after a successful 20-plus year career as a publishing executive.) In THE UNDERCOVER ECONOMIST (Random House, $14.95), Tim Harford, who writes the ''Dear Economist'' column for The Financial Times, applies basic economic theory to everyday transactions like overspending in the supermarket and Starbucks's pricing system.IN THE COMPANY OF THE COURTESAN, by Sarah Dunant. (Random House, $13.95.) This colorful historical novel, by the British author of ''The Birth of Venus,'' explores the upheaval of Renaissance Italy through the story of a fictitious courtesan, Fiammetta Bianchini, whom Dunant envisions as the nude model for Titian's ''Venus of Urbino.'' After escaping from the 1527 pillage of Rome, Fiammetta sets up shop in Venice with Bucino, a wily dwarf who acts as her pimp and protector.EAT, PRAY, LOVE: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia, by Elizabeth Gilbert. (Penguin, $15.) Reeling from a contentious divorce, a volatile rebound romance and a bout of depression, Gilbert decided, at 34, to embark on a yearlong trip of spiritual seeking and recovery in Italy, India and Indonesia. ''I wanted to thoroughly explore one aspect of myself set against the backdrop of each country,'' she writes in this exuberant travelogue. ''I wanted to explore the art of pleasure in Italy, the art of devotion in India and, in Indonesia, the art of balancing the two.''RAMPART STREET, by David Fulmer. (Harvest/Harcourt, $14.) Valentin St. Cyr, the errant Creole detective at the center of Fulmer's historical series, resurfaces in New Orleans's red-light Storyville district to solve the murder of a rich white man who met his fate on the rough side of Rampart Street.

AT THE SAME TIME
 Essays and Speeches.
 By Susan Sontag. 
 Edited by Paolo Dilonardo and Anne Jump.
 235 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $23.
Writing to Hannah Arendt in December 1967, Mary McCarthy reported Susan Sontag's arrest in an antiwar demonstration, and then abruptly asked: ''And what about her? When I last watched her with you at the Lowells, it was clear that she was going to seek to conquer you. Or that she had fallen in love with you -- the same thing. Anyway, did she?'' 
 Arendt's response is not known. But it is not hard to see why the young Sontag chose the German-Jewish philosopher as one of her ''models of the serious.'' As a precocious reader in Arizona and California, Sontag grew up on the high idea of European literature and thought upheld by The Partisan Review, the primary magazine of New York liberal intellectuals in the 1940s and '50s. After moving to New York in the early 1960s, Sontag decided that the liberal imagination needed to loosen up a bit. Joining in the emerging counterculture, she called for an ''erotics of art'' and celebrated the ''defiantly pluralistic'' new sensibility ''dedicated both to an excruciating seriousness and to fun and wit and nostalgia.'' She argued for an understanding of the ''revolutionary implications of sexuality in contemporary society.'' 
 In later years she would come to refine and even abandon some of these views. ''Recreational, risk-free sexuality,'' she declared sternly in ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' (1989), ''is an inevitable reinvention of the culture of capitalism.'' In a 1995 afterword to ''Against Interpretation,'' her first collection of essays, she lamented that the ''triumphant values of consumer capitalism promote -- indeed, impose -- the cultural mixes and insolence and defense of pleasure that I was advocating.''
 However, Sontag never ceased to seek her cultural heroes in Europe. Hannah Arendt, a refugee from Hitler's Germany and analyst of totalitarianism, clearly embodied the virtues ''of the European suffering, of European intellectual courage, of European vigor, of European overcomplexity'' as glamorously as those European writers -- Camus, Simone Weil, Walter Benjamin, E. M. Cioran, Roland Barthes, W. G. Sebald -- whom Sontag wrote about in tones of elegiac piety. 
 The nostalgia for a European nobility of mind that suffused Sontag's aesthetic and intellectual quests was accompanied by an often scornful suspicion of what she called in one of her last speeches ''the strenuous mercantilist biases of American culture.'' ''At the Same Time,'' a posthumous collection of her speeches and essays, shows how her feeling for a vanished Europe deepened even as she grew more distrustful of an America she saw in the grip of a ''dangerous, lobotomizing notion of endless war.'' Mostly written during the Bush administration, they reveal a darkening vision of America as well as the rest of the contemporary world. Writing about Victor Serge -- one of the European writers praised here along with Halldor Laxness, Leonid Tsypkin and Anna Banti -- Sontag speaks fondly of ''an era that seems very remote today in its introspective energies and passionate intellectual quests and code of self-sacrifice and immense hope.'' Reading the private correspondence of Rilke, Pasternak and Tsvetayeva, she confesses that ''their ardors and their tenacities feel like raft, beacon, beach.''
 Feeling herself marooned by ''American conformism, self-righteousness, and moralism,'' Sontag responded with startling vehemence to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 in a short, much-reviled piece in The New Yorker (reprinted in ''At the Same Time''). Sontag, who died in December 2004, did not witness the true scale of the political and intellectual failure that led to the disaster in Iraq -- what today makes her denunciation of the ''sanctimonious, reality-concealing rhetoric'' of government officials and the media seem cautionary rather than callous. Nevertheless, there was enough in the post-9/11 political climate to disturb and alarm her, and to provoke her into redefining and restating her views on literature.
 While praising Victor Serge, Nadine Gordimer and Fernando Pessoa in her speeches, she resurrected an old-fashioned idea of literature as protest. ''A great writer of fiction, by writing truthfully about the society in which she or he lives, cannot help but evoke (if only by their absence) the better standards of justice and of truthfulness that we have the right (some would say the duty) to militate for in the necessarily imperfect societies in which we live.''
 This quasi-Marxist view of the writer's responsibility could not seem further from Sontag's youthful enthusiasm for the pleasure principle over moral and political interpretation. But then her vision of ''reality redeemed, recovered, transcended by consciousness; a vision of the life of the mind as a life of desire, of full intelligence and pleasure,'' a vision that Sontag once defined as particularly French, always coexisted in her with the traditions that she claimed were ''so different'': ''the traditions of high moral seriousness of German and Russian literature.''
 Sontag asserted a uniquely American privilege by embracing multiple European traditions; and she used a word prone to much abuse -- ''spiritual'' -- often and remarkably precisely to make a higher consciousness appear imperative for political as well as artistic engagements with the world. Indeed, no secular intellectual in our time rescued ''spirituality'' more effectively from its usual vendors, the pious, the hypocritical and the deluded.
 Defining culture as a ''dialectic'' and great artists as ''repositories of the dialectic of their times,'' Lionel Trilling once claimed that the notable writers of 19th-century America could balance ''both the yes and no of the culture, and by that token they were prophetic of the future.'' Sontag's ardent inconsistencies and contradictions over the years now make her seem a part of this venerable American tradition. Living through the countercultural '60s, and the subsequent ascendancy of conservative and neoconservative politics, she felt compelled to respond, even at the risk of self-contradiction, to what she saw as particular aesthetic and political imperatives within her society. 
 Acutely aware of the ideologically motivated crimes Europeans had committed upon themselves and others in the 20th century, Sontag feared ''another century of extremes, of horrors.'' Economic and cultural globalization, generally proposed as an antidote to violence and terrorism, did not impress her much. ''I live,'' she wrote after a trip to Vietnam in 1968, ''in an unethical society that coarsens the sensibilities and thwarts the capacities for goodness of most people.'' In her last speeches Sontag offered a similarly bleak view of the American-style consumer society that spreads itself across the globe, destroying the past, and enclosing all horizons within a selfish materialism. ''We live in a culture committed to unifying greeds,'' with ''everyone on the planet feeding at the same trough of standardized entertainment and fantasies of eros and violence.'' She grew nostalgic for the iconoclastic spirit of the 1960s: ''How one wishes that some of its boldness, its optimism, its disdain for commerce had survived.'' In her later years she warned repeatedly of the dangers that the global culture of individual gratification posed to thinkers and artists. ''There is no culture ... without a standard of altruism, of regard for others.''
 The amplified note of despair and loss in ''At the Same Time'' makes Sontag resemble one of the European ''last'' intellectuals she often wrote about, ''that Saturnine hero of modern culture'' standing alone in the ruins of history. This anguish may seem exaggerated, part of her frequently noted self-regard. But, in her later weariness with modern civilization, Sontag fulfilled a particularly American destiny. Gertrude Stein once claimed that America was the oldest country in the world, since it was the ''mother of the 20th-century civilization.'' Sontag, who had a tragic sense of history rarely found among her peers, never failed to absorb the lessons of her country's old age and accumulated experience of modernity. It is why the melancholy and occasional bitter wisdom of her last writings appear to be of a mature and passionately engaged American rather than of a marginal and jaded European sensibility -- one that has not only learned from the past but, by grappling vigorously with the present, can also divine, if gloomily, the future.

To the Editor:
 In reviewing Margaret MacMillan's ''Nixon and Mao'' (Feb. 25), John Lewis Gaddis writes: ''When Nixon took office in 1969, he inherited a war in Vietnam that was costing the United States far more in lives, money and reputation than is the current war in Iraq.'' 
Gaddis is right about the relative cost in American lives. But the Iraq war is likely to cost more, not less -- let alone far less -- than the Vietnam War, even adjusting for inflation. Independent estimates put the ultimate cost of the Iraq war in the vicinity of $1 trillion to $2 trillion. In contrast, the Vietnam War is estimated to have cost in the range of $530 billion to $660 billion in today's dollars.
 The cost of the Iraq war to America's reputation is not quantifiable, but one need only think about how far it has fallen since Le Monde's headline after Sept. 11, ''Nous Sommes Tous Americains,'' to question Gaddis's judgment.Colin RustManhattan

HEADLINE: Utah's Epic Ride

BYLINE: By STEPHEN REGENOLD. 
Stephen Regenold is a freelance writer based in Minneapolis.

 BODY:
UP high in the sunny Wasatch mountain range, above the tree line at 10,000 feet, the Highway to Heaven is just 500 yards long.
 That's the distance, at least, that our guide, Deb Lovci, cited as we approached the entrance gate. ''Just 500 yards, a quick traverse to Twin Lakes Pass, then we'll jump back into the powder,'' she said.
It was a springlike Sunday in January in the mountains above Salt Lake City, where a cluster of six ski resorts occupy adjacent valleys of granite, thick forests and deep powder snow. The Highway to Heaven -- an exposed backcountry route connecting two alpine valleys -- traversed the steep slope ahead, cutting a track along an avalanche-prone ridge.
 ''Keep moving -- don't get off the route,'' Ms. Lovci yelled out, a line of skiers shuffling past. Ski edges sliced against the slope for a 20-minute traverse. Then it was back to the trees, back to the glinting powder and giant sweeping S-turns, flying downhill, skirting boulders and stumps, the wind in my eyes again on another epic ride. 
 The Ski Utah Interconnect Adventure Tour had started for us five hours earlier, with an 8:30 a.m. chairlift ride at Deer Valley Resort, the first ski area our group would visit that day. A daylong guided trip, the Interconnect Tour follows a circuitous route of in-bounds ski trails and steep backcountry runs. Chairlift rides are combined with out-of-bounds traverses, or skiing across slopes, to connect the resorts that sprawl through this part of the Wasatch Range.
 In a single day, Interconnect skiers travel about 25 miles through the mountains, carving more than 15,000 vertical feet of turns on the slopes and adjacent backcountry at Deer Valley, Park City Mountain Resort, Brighton Resort, Solitude Mountain Resort, Alta Ski Area and Snowbird Ski and Summer Resort.
 Deep and airy powder snow, fast groomed trails, knee-busting mogul runs and rocky chutes are among the tour's challenges. Runs range from high-intermediate to the most difficult double-black, linking one valley to the next via backcountry detours that drop downhill, one unrelenting mile after the next.
 ''Nothing I've done outside of Europe compares to this tour,'' said Mike Carroll, a 45-year-old real estate developer from Richmond, Va., one of the 10 clients Ms. Lovci and a co-guide, Pat Ormond, led on the recent Interconnect tour. ''This valley-to-valley thing is very French or Austrian, very Euro-style,'' Mr. Carroll said.
 Indeed, at no other place in the Western Hemisphere can you find a similar concentration of ski resorts. All six areas -- plus the Canyons Resort, a nearby 3,700-acre behemoth touted as the biggest ski area in the state -- have property lines that fall within a 10-mile radius. The Wasatch resorts are so close and tidy -- glades, bowls and fluted ski runs from one area nearly abutting the next -- that airline passengers flying overhead might mistake the whole network as a gigantic unified ski resort. (A Wasatch megaresort that connects up to seven existing ski areas via cable cars, chairlifts and tunnels is a decades-old conversation in local ski-business circles -- a project that, if completed, could create the largest ski resort on the planet.) 
 The Interconnect Adventure Tour, which runs daily all season long, through early April, is a sampling platter where skiers can taste the immensity of the area's chairlift-accessible terrain.
 Backcountry parts of the trip -- wide and untracked powder bowls, rocky chutes and steep-gladed runs through towering pines -- add the adventure component to the tour.
 ''There is nowhere else in the United States you can do this without getting on a helicopter,'' said Ms. Lovci, who has guided backcountry ski trips for almost two decades.
 In the age of $80 daily lift tickets, the Interconnect Tour is relatively economical, too: Its $195 per-person fee includes a pair of professional ski guides to lead the trip; lunch at Solitude Mountain Resort; a free (and compulsory) avalanche transceiver for use during the day; lift passes to all six areas on the schedule; shuttle-bus transportation at the end of the day back to your point of origin; and a finisher's pin to prove you've done the trip.
 But first you have to ski the Highway to Heaven. 
 Skiers on the Interconnect traverse backcountry routes like the Highway to Heaven, which connect valleys via out-of-bounds alpine passageways. The group moves steadily all day long, flying down in-bounds trails at the resorts to make time, ducking ropes (with permission) or passing through boundary gates, and then again heading downhill through the backcountry.
 For now, only skiers are allowed on Interconnect trips, as snowboards are shunned at two resorts on the list.
 Interconnect groups radio in and out at each area with ski patrollers. Avalanche conditions are continually assessed.
 The guides -- one always up front, one always in back -- keep the group on pace to ensure that all six ski resorts are tagged by 3 p.m. The trip's final run, a drop of more than 3,000 vertical feet from the top of Hidden Peak at Snowbird into Little Cottonwood Canyon, is the capstone to the day.
 My Interconnect experience began on a midwinter Sunday with an early-morning drive to Deer Valley, where the day's 10 Interconnect clients -- all men, aged 28 to 45 -- met at 8 a.m. for a briefing.
 ''Conditions are variable out there,'' Ms. Lovci told the group. ''We're going to be tiptoeing through the backcountry today.''
 Significant snow had not fallen on the Wasatch in two weeks, leaving the backcountry solid and sunbaked, rocks poking out from a mantle of icy snow. But Ms. Lovci still promised some powder.
 ''We can always find good snow,'' she said.
 The first hour of the day was filled with fast runs on groomed trails, 12 skiers skimming perfect snow at Deer Valley and Park City, which essentially share a border. We slipped under a rope atop Empire Canyon to sidestep and then stride a couple of hundred feet from one resort to the next. 
 McConkey's Bowl, a mogul-strewn double-diamond run at Park City, was the day's first challenge. I skied the pitch with Dave Wysnewski and Mark Richardson, a lawyer and a landscaper, who are friends from the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
 Spindrift snow whipped up with each carved turn. I hopped rocks, exposed little black teeth in hardpack snow.
 Rooster tails of mist arched from ski tips and tails as we slipped through McConkey's moguls, knees knocking and chugging like pistons, poles planting atop each icy mound, from mogul to mogul to mogul on down. 
 ''Wow, steeper than it looked,'' said Mr. Wysnewski, breathing hard at the bottom of the bowl.
 The exit from Park City put us into the first real backcountry of the tour, a tract of old mining land called Mill F. An hour of outback terrain would shoot us deep into Big Cottonwood Canyon, home of Solitude Mountain Resort and Brighton.
 ''O.K., come through one at a time, 20 feet or more between you,'' Ms. Lovci instructed as we ducked the orange rope at Park City's boundary to ski into the trees. It was time to check avalanche transceivers before dropping into the deep unpatrolled snow beyond.
 Holding out her sensor, Ms. Lovci scanned all 10 clients at the chest, double-checking for a signal from the transceiver beacons strapped against our bodies. In a worst case -- a deep burying avalanche -- guides and mountain rescuers can locate submerged skiers via these blipping radio beacons.
 But avoiding avalanche-prone slopes is job No. 1 for Ms. Lovci and her colleagues, who study seasonal snow pack, monitor weather patterns, and dig onsite snow pits to assess slide conditions.
 ''We're good to go,'' Ms. Lovci said after scanning the last skier passing by. ''I'm sensing some powder ahead.''
 Ms. Lovci was right. The next 50 turns -- giant S-curves through trees on a foot of shimmering fluff -- were the best of the day.
 Little snowballs tumbled by as I stopped to catch a breath. The white and towering mountains of Big Cottonwood Canyon cut a silhouette on a backdrop of blue all around.
 Aldo Stanton, a businessman from Boulder, Colo., swooped past my stance. ''Yodel-eh-he-hoo,'' he belted out, not a smidge of irony in his coo.
 Near the end of the Mill F segment, which had descended thousands of feet and more than two miles toward the Big Cottonwood resorts, we entered a glade of quaking aspen and pine. Untracked snow sparked in the sun.
 High overhead, thousands of feet in the air on the opposite side of the canyon, the rocky ridge of Solitude Mountain Resort and the alpine face of the Highway to Heaven were just visible through the trees.
 Pat Ormond, the guide, pointed it out. ''That's our big traverse after lunch,'' he said, a ski pole pointing to the sky.
 The trees below were tight, branches reaching out like arms. The Interconnect crew paused to pick a line, 12 skiers silent for a moment above the forest of fluff.
 ''Follow my tracks,'' Mr. Ormond said before pushing off and disappearing downhill.
 The entrance to Solitude Mountain Resort was a few hundred feet ahead. I tucked for speed in a meadow before slicing an edge into the white.
 Two dozen more turns and we'd approach Solitude's base area, a tangle of lifts and lodges under high craggy peaks.
 Before noon it would be three ski resorts down, and just three more to go.Routes to a Backcountry Slope
 LONG sunny days and stable mountain snow make spring the best season for backcountry excursions like the Ski Utah Interconnect Adventure Tour, which runs daily through early April.
 Skiers on the one-day Interconnect Tour follow guides to sample the slopes at up to six resorts in the Wasatch mountain range in Utah, where the ski areas can be linked by backcountry routes. You ride chairlifts inside the resort boundaries and hike or sidestep along the connecting routes.
 Included on the tour are Deer Valley Resort, Park City Mountain Resort, Brighton Resort, Solitude Mountain Resort, Alta Ski Area and Snowbird Ski and Summer Resort.
 Ski Utah, the company that operates the Interconnect Tour, takes a maximum of 12 skiers out each day. The company (www.skiutah.com) allows advanced skiers in good physical condition to sign up; no previous backcountry experience is required. Last year more than 700 skiers completed the Interconnect Tour, which costs $195 a person. Information: (801) 534-1907.
 In Wyoming, Jackson Hole Mountain Resort (www.jacksonhole.com) abuts the mountain wilderness of Bridger-Teton National Forest, where resort guides lead backcountry trips through April 8.
 From the top of 10,450-foot Rendezvous Mountain, Jackson Hole skiers have access to thousands of acres of backcountry terrain, including bowls, chutes and nearby mountain peaks -- all accessible with minimal hiking or climbing.
 The daylong trips include runs through the backcountry that end in traverses returning to the ski area, where chairlifts and gondolas bring groups back up Rendezvous Mountain. A full day of guided skiing at Jackson Hole costs $520 for a group of three skiers or snowboarders, with an additional $100 a person up to a maximum of five. Information: (307) 733-2292.
 Another Wyoming backcountry option is Grand Targhee Resort (www.grandtarghee.com), where the SnowCat Adventures program incorporates tracked vehicles (snowcats) in lieu of chairlifts. Up to 24 skiers a day are treated to Peaked Mountain, a private ski area within a ski area that has gladed tree runs, north-facing bowls and famously deep powder snow. 
 Two guides lead SnowCat Adventures groups, which run laps on the 1,000-acre mountain face. Up to 20,000 vertical feet of turns in a day are common.
 Grand Targhee Resort runs its SnowCat Adventures through mid-April. The cost is $349 a person for a full day, including a picnic lunch (held in a yurt when the weather demands it). Details at (800) 827-4433.
 Silverton Mountain in Colorado (www.silvertonmountain.com) is a hybrid ski area with just one chairlift and terrain that is entirely at the advanced and expert level. Most skiers ride the lift -- which tops out at 12,300 feet -- but then continue on with short hikes and traverses to reach the backcountry chutes and bowls that flank the mountain.
 Silverton Mountain requires all skiers to travel with guides from Jan. 18 to April 1. (A guided ski day costs $129 per person.) From April 5 to closing in May, a period when avalanches are less of a concern, guides are not required, and lift tickets cost $49. Details at (970) 387-5706. STEPHEN REGENOLD

HEADLINE: The Brain on the Stand

BYLINE: By Jeffrey Rosen. 
Jeffrey Rosen, a frequent contributor, is the author most recently of ''The Supreme Court: The Personalities and Rivalries That Defined America.''

 BODY:
I. Mr. Weinstein's Cyst When historians of the future try to identify the moment that neuroscience began to transform the American legal system, they may point to a little-noticed case from the early 1990s. The case involved Herbert Weinstein, a 65-year-old ad executive who was charged with strangling his wife, Barbara, to death and then, in an effort to make the murder look like a suicide, throwing her body out the window of their 12th-floor apartment on East 72nd Street in Manhattan. Before the trial began, Weinstein's lawyer suggested that his client should not be held responsible for his actions because of a mental defect -- namely, an abnormal cyst nestled in his arachnoid membrane, which surrounds the brain like a spider web. 
The implications of the claim were considerable. American law holds people criminally responsible unless they act under duress (with a gun pointed at the head, for example) or if they suffer from a serious defect in rationality -- like not being able to tell right from wrong. But if you suffer from such a serious defect, the law generally doesn't care why -- whether it's an unhappy childhood or an arachnoid cyst or both. To suggest that criminals could be excused because their brains made them do it seems to imply that anyone whose brain isn't functioning properly could be absolved of responsibility. But should judges and juries really be in the business of defining the normal or properly working brain? And since all behavior is caused by our brains, wouldn't this mean all behavior could potentially be excused? 
 The prosecution at first tried to argue that evidence of Weinstein's arachnoid cyst shouldn't be admitted in court. One of the government's witnesses, a forensic psychologist named Daniel Martell, testified that brain-scanning technologies were new and untested, and their implications weren't yet widely accepted by the scientific community. Ultimately, on Oct. 8, 1992, Judge Richard Carruthers issued a Solomonic ruling: Weinstein's lawyers could tell the jury that brain scans had identified an arachnoid cyst, but they couldn't tell jurors that arachnoid cysts were associated with violence. Even so, the prosecution team seemed to fear that simply exhibiting images of Weinstein's brain in court would sway the jury. Eleven days later, on the morning of jury selection, they agreed to let Weinstein plead guilty in exchange for a reduced charge of manslaughter. 
 After the Weinstein case, Daniel Martell found himself in so much demand to testify as a expert witness that he started a consulting business called Forensic Neuroscience. Hired by defense teams and prosecutors alike, he has testified over the past 15 years in several hundred criminal and civil cases. In those cases, neuroscientific evidence has been admitted to show everything from head trauma to the tendency of violent video games to make children behave aggressively. But Martell told me that it's in death-penalty litigation that neuroscience evidence is having its most revolutionary effect. ''Some sort of organic brain defense has become de rigueur in any sort of capital defense,'' he said. Lawyers routinely order scans of convicted defendants' brains and argue that a neurological impairment prevented them from controlling themselves. The prosecution counters that the evidence shouldn't be admitted, but under the relaxed standards for mitigating evidence during capital sentencing, it usually is. Indeed, a Florida court has held that the failure to admit neuroscience evidence during capital sentencing is grounds for a reversal. Martell remains skeptical about the worth of the brain scans, but he observes that they've ''revolutionized the law.''
 The extent of that revolution is hotly debated, but the influence of what some call neurolaw is clearly growing. Neuroscientific evidence has persuaded jurors to sentence defendants to life imprisonment rather than to death; courts have also admitted brain-imaging evidence during criminal trials to support claims that defendants like John W. Hinckley Jr., who tried to assassinate President Reagan, are insane. Carter Snead, a law professor at Notre Dame, drafted a staff working paper on the impact of neuroscientific evidence in criminal law for President Bush's Council on Bioethics. The report concludes that neuroimaging evidence is of mixed reliability but ''the large number of cases in which such evidence is presented is striking.'' That number will no doubt increase substantially. Proponents of neurolaw say that neuroscientific evidence will have a large impact not only on questions of guilt and punishment but also on the detection of lies and hidden bias, and on the prediction of future criminal behavior. At the same time, skeptics fear that the use of brain-scanning technology as a kind of super mind-reading device will threaten our privacy and mental freedom, leading some to call for the legal system to respond with a new concept of ''cognitive liberty.'' 
 One of the most enthusiastic proponents of neurolaw is Owen Jones, a professor of law and biology at Vanderbilt. Jones (who happens to have been one of my law-school classmates) has joined a group of prominent neuroscientists and law professors who have applied for a large MacArthur Foundation grant; they hope to study a wide range of neurolaw questions, like: Do sexual offenders and violent teenagers show unusual patterns of brain activity? Is it possible to capture brain images of chronic neck pain when someone claims to have suffered whiplash? In the meantime, Jones is turning Vanderbilt into a kind of Los Alamos for neurolaw. The university has just opened a $27 million neuroimaging center and has poached leading neuroscientists from around the world; soon, Jones hopes to enroll students in the nation's first program in law and neuroscience. ''It's breathlessly exciting,'' he says. ''This is the new frontier in law and science -- we're peering into the black box to see how the brain is actually working, that hidden place in the dark quiet, where we have our private thoughts and private reactions -- and the law will inevitably have to decide how to deal with this new technology.''II. A Visit to Vanderbilt: Owen Jones is a disciplined and quietly intense man, and his enthusiasm for the transformative power of neuroscience is infectious. With Rene Marois, a neuroscientist in the psychology department, Jones has begun a study of how the human brain reacts when asked to impose various punishments. Informally, they call the experiment Harm and Punishment -- and they offered to make me one of their first subjects.
 We met in Jones's pristine office, which is decorated with a human skull and calipers, like those that phrenologists once used to measure the human head; his father is a dentist, and his grandfather was an electrical engineer who collected tools. We walked over to Vanderbilt's Institute of Imaging Science, which, although still surrounded by scaffolding, was as impressive as Jones had promised. The basement contains one of the few 7-tesla magnetic-resonance-imaging scanners in the world. For Harm and Punishment, Jones and Marois use a less powerful 3 tesla, which is the typical research M.R.I.
 We then made our way to the scanner. After removing all metal objects -- including a belt and a stray dry-cleaning tag with a staple -- I put on earphones and a helmet that was shaped like a birdcage to hold my head in place. The lab assistant turned off the lights and left the room; I lay down on the gurney and, clutching a panic button, was inserted into the magnet. All was dark except for a screen flashing hypothetical crime scenarios, like this one: ''John, who lives at home with his father, decides to kill him for the insurance money. After convincing his father to help with some electrical work in the attic, John arranges for him to be electrocuted. His father survives the electrocution, but he is hospitalized for three days with injuries caused by the electrical shock.'' I was told to press buttons indicating the appropriate level of punishment, from 0 to 9, as the magnet recorded my brain activity. 
 After I spent 45 minutes trying not to move an eyebrow while assigning punishments to dozens of sordid imaginary criminals, Marois told me through the intercom to try another experiment: namely, to think of familiar faces and places in sequence, without telling him whether I was starting with faces or places. I thought of my living room, my wife, my parents' apartment and my twin sons, trying all the while to avoid improper thoughts for fear they would be discovered. Then the experiments were over, and I stumbled out of the magnet. 
 The next morning, Owen Jones and I reported to Rene Marois's laboratory for the results. Marois's graduate students, who had been up late analyzing my brain, were smiling broadly. Because I had moved so little in the machine, they explained, my brain activity was easy to read. ''Your head movement was incredibly low, and you were the harshest punisher we've had,'' Josh Buckholtz, one of the grad students, said with a happy laugh. ''You were a researcher's dream come true!'' Buckholtz tapped the keyboard, and a high-resolution 3-D image of my brain appeared on the screen in vivid colors. Tiny dots flickered back and forth, showing my eyes moving as they read the lurid criminal scenarios. Although I was only the fifth subject to be put in the scanner, Marois emphasized that my punishment ratings were higher than average. In one case, I assigned a 7 where the average punishment was 4. ''You were focusing on the intent, and the others focused on the harm,'' Buckholtz said reassuringly. 
 Marois explained that he and Jones wanted to study the interactions among the emotion-generating regions of the brain, like the amygdala, and the prefrontal regions responsible for reason. ''It is also possible that the prefrontal cortex is critical for attributing punishment, making the essential decision about what kind of punishment to assign,'' he suggested. Marois stressed that in order to study that possibility, more subjects would have to be put into the magnet. But if the prefrontal cortex does turn out to be critical for selecting among punishments, Jones added, it could be highly relevant for lawyers selecting a jury. For example, he suggested, lawyers might even select jurors for different cases based on their different brain-activity patterns. In a complex insider-trading case, for example, perhaps the defense would ''like to have a juror making decisions on maximum deliberation and minimum emotion''; in a government entrapment case, emotional reactions might be more appropriate.
 We then turned to the results of the second experiment, in which I had been asked to alternate between thinking of faces and places without disclosing the order. ''We think we can guess what you were thinking about, even though you didn't tell us the order you started with,'' Marois said proudly. ''We think you started with places and we will prove to you that it wasn't just luck.'' Marois showed me a picture of my parahippocampus, the area of the brain that responds strongly to places and the recognition of scenes. ''It's lighting up like Christmas on all cylinders,'' Marois said. ''It worked beautifully, even though we haven't tried this before here.''
 He then showed a picture of the fusiform area, which is responsible for facial recognition. It, too, lighted up every time I thought of a face. ''This is a potentially very serious legal implication,'' Jones broke in, since the technology allows us to tell what people are thinking about even if they deny it. He pointed to a series of practical applications. Because subconscious memories of faces and places may be more reliable than conscious memories, witness lineups could be transformed. A child who claimed to have been victimized by a stranger, moreover, could be shown pictures of the faces of suspects to see which one lighted up the face-recognition area in ways suggesting familiarity. 
 Jones and Marois talked excitedly about the implications of their experiments for the legal system. If they discovered a significant gap between people's hard-wired sense of how severely certain crimes should be punished and the actual punishments assigned by law, federal sentencing guidelines might be revised, on the principle that the law shouldn't diverge too far from deeply shared beliefs. Experiments might help to develop a deeper understanding of the criminal brain, or of the typical brain predisposed to criminal activity.III. The End of Responsibility?: Indeed, as the use of functional M.R.I. results becomes increasingly common in courtrooms, judges and juries may be asked to draw new and sometimes troubling lines between ''normal'' and ''abnormal'' brains. Ruben Gur, a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, specializes in doing just that. Gur began his expert-witness career in the mid-1990s when a colleague asked him to help in the trial of a convicted serial killer in Florida named Bobby Joe Long. Known as the ''classified-ad rapist,'' because he would respond to classified ads placed by women offering to sell household items, then rape and kill them, Long was sentenced to death after he committed at least nine murders in Tampa. Gur was called as a national expert in positron-emission tomography, or PET scans, in which patients are injected with a solution containing radioactive markers that illuminate their brain activity. After examining Long's PET scans, Gur testified that a motorcycle accident that had left Long in a coma had also severely damaged his amygdala. It was after emerging from the coma that Long committed his first rape. 
 ''I didn't have the sense that my testimony had a profound impact,'' Gur told me recently -- Long is still filing appeals -- but he has testified at more than 20 capital cases since then. He wrote a widely circulated affidavit arguing that adolescents are not as capable of controlling their impulses as adults because the development of neurons in the prefrontal cortex isn't complete until the early 20s. Based on that affidavit, Gur was asked to contribute to the preparation of one of the briefs filed by neuroscientists and others in Roper v. Simmons, the landmark case in which a divided Supreme Court struck down the death penalty for offenders who committed crimes when they were under the age of 18. 
 The leading neurolaw brief in the case, filed by the American Medical Association and other groups, argued that because ''adolescent brains are not fully developed'' in the prefrontal regions, adolescents are less able than adults to control their impulses and should not be held fully accountable ''for the immaturity of their neural anatomy.'' In his majority decision, Justice Anthony Kennedy declared that ''as any parent knows and as the scientific and sociological studies'' cited in the briefs ''tend to confirm, '[a] lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in youth more often than in adults.' '' Although Kennedy did not cite the neuroscience evidence specifically, his indirect reference to the scientific studies in the briefs led some supporters and critics to view the decision as the Brown v. Board of Education of neurolaw. 
 One important question raised by the Roper case was the question of where to draw the line in considering neuroscience evidence as a legal mitigation or excuse. Should courts be in the business of deciding when to mitigate someone's criminal responsibility because his brain functions improperly, whether because of age, in-born defects or trauma? As we learn more about criminals' brains, will we have to redefine our most basic ideas of justice?
 Two of the most ardent supporters of the claim that neuroscience requires the redefinition of guilt and punishment are Joshua D. Greene, an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard, and Jonathan D. Cohen, a professor of psychology who directs the neuroscience program at Princeton. Greene got Cohen interested in the legal implications of neuroscience, and together they conducted a series of experiments exploring how people's brains react to moral dilemmas involving life and death. In particular, they wanted to test people's responses in the f.M.R.I. scanner to variations of the famous trolley problem, which philosophers have been arguing about for decades.
 The trolley problem goes something like this: Imagine a train heading toward five people who are going to die if you don't do anything. If you hit a switch, the train veers onto a side track and kills another person. Most people confronted with this scenario say it's O.K. to hit the switch. By contrast, imagine that you're standing on a footbridge that spans the train tracks, and the only way you can save the five people is to push an obese man standing next to you off the footbridge so that his body stops the train. Under these circumstances, most people say it's not O.K. to kill one person to save five. 
 ''I wondered why people have such clear intuitions,'' Greene told me, ''and the core idea was to confront people with these two cases in the scanner and see if we got more of an emotional response in one case and reasoned response in the other.'' As it turns out, that's precisely what happened: Greene and Cohen found that the brain region associated with deliberate problem solving and self-control, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, was especially active when subjects confronted the first trolley hypothetical, in which most of them made a utilitarian judgment about how to save the greatest number of lives. By contrast, emotional centers in the brain were more active when subjects confronted the second trolley hypothetical, in which they tended to recoil at the idea of personally harming an individual, even under such wrenching circumstances. ''This suggests that moral judgment is not a single thing; it's intuitive emotional responses and then cognitive responses that are duking it out,'' Greene said. 
 ''To a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain,'' Greene says. ''If that's right, it radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is all that matters is whether you're rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational but whose strings are being pulled by something beyond his control.'' In other words, even someone who has the illusion of making a free and rational choice between soup and salad may be deluding himself, since the choice of salad over soup is ultimately predestined by forces hard-wired in his brain. Greene insists that this insight means that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution -- the idea that bad people should be punished because they have freely chosen to act immorally -- which has been the focus of American criminal law since the 1970s, when rehabilitation went out of fashion. Instead, Greene says, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, he supposes, this might mean lighter punishments. ''If it's really true that we don't get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish that person, then it's not worth punishing that person,'' he says. (On the other hand, Carter Snead, the Notre Dame scholar, maintains that capital defendants who are not considered fully blameworthy under current rules could be executed more readily under a system that focused on preventing future harms.) 
 Others agree with Greene and Cohen that the legal system should be radically refocused on deterrence rather than on retribution. Since the celebrated M'Naughten case in 1843, involving a paranoid British assassin, English and American courts have recognized an insanity defense only for those who are unable to appreciate the difference between right and wrong. (This is consistent with the idea that only rational people can be held criminally responsible for their actions.) According to some neuroscientists, that rule makes no sense in light of recent brain-imaging studies. ''You can have a horrendously damaged brain where someone knows the difference between right and wrong but nonetheless can't control their behavior,'' says Robert Sapolsky, a neurobiologist at Stanford. ''At that point, you're dealing with a broken machine, and concepts like punishment and evil and sin become utterly irrelevant. Does that mean the person should be dumped back on the street? Absolutely not. You have a car with the brakes not working, and it shouldn't be allowed to be near anyone it can hurt.'' 
 Even as these debates continue, some skeptics contend that both the hopes and fears attached to neurolaw are overblown. ''There's nothing new about the neuroscience ideas of responsibility; it's just another material, causal explanation of human behavior,'' says Stephen J. Morse, professor of law and psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. ''How is this different than the Chicago school of sociology,'' which tried to explain human behavior in terms of environment and social structures? ''How is it different from genetic explanations or psychological explanations? The only thing different about neuroscience is that we have prettier pictures and it appears more scientific.'' 
 Morse insists that ''brains do not commit crimes; people commit crimes'' -- a conclusion he suggests has been ignored by advocates who, ''infected and inflamed by stunning advances in our understanding of the brain . . . all too often make moral and legal claims that the new neuroscience . . . cannot sustain.'' He calls this ''brain overclaim syndrome'' and cites as an example the neuroscience briefs filed in the Supreme Court case Roper v. Simmons to question the juvenile death penalty. ''What did the neuroscience add?'' he asks. If adolescent brains caused all adolescent behavior, ''we would expect the rates of homicide to be the same for 16- and 17-year-olds everywhere in the world -- their brains are alike -- but in fact, the homicide rates of Danish and Finnish youths are very different than American youths.'' Morse agrees that our brains bring about our behavior -- ''I'm a thoroughgoing materialist, who believes that all mental and behavioral activity is the causal product of physical events in the brain'' -- but he disagrees that the law should excuse certain kinds of criminal conduct as a result. ''It's a total non sequitur,'' he says. ''So what if there's biological causation? Causation can't be an excuse for someone who believes that responsibility is possible. Since all behavior is caused, this would mean all behavior has to be excused.'' Morse cites the case of Charles Whitman, a man who, in 1966, killed his wife and his mother, then climbed up a tower at the University of Texas and shot and killed 13 more people before being shot by police officers. Whitman was discovered after an autopsy to have a tumor that was putting pressure on his amygdala. ''Even if his amygdala made him more angry and volatile, since when are anger and volatility excusing conditions?'' Morse asks. ''Some people are angry because they had bad mommies and daddies and others because their amygdalas are mucked up. The question is: When should anger be an excusing condition?'' 
 Still, Morse concedes that there are circumstances under which new discoveries from neuroscience could challenge the legal system at its core. ''Suppose neuroscience could reveal that reason actually plays no role in determining human behavior,'' he suggests tantalizingly. ''Suppose I could show you that your intentions and your reasons for your actions are post hoc rationalizations that somehow your brain generates to explain to you what your brain has already done'' without your conscious participation. If neuroscience could reveal us to be automatons in this respect, Morse is prepared to agree with Greene and Cohen that criminal law would have to abandon its current ideas about responsibility and seek other ways of protecting society. 
 Some scientists are already pushing in this direction. In a series of famous experiments in the 1970s and '80s, Benjamin Libet measured people's brain activity while telling them to move their fingers whenever they felt like it. Libet detected brain activity suggesting a readiness to move the finger half a second before the actual movement and about 400 milliseconds before people became aware of their conscious intention to move their finger. Libet argued that this leaves 100 milliseconds for the conscious self to veto the brain's unconscious decision, or to give way to it -- suggesting, in the words of the neuroscientist Vilayanur S. Ramachandran, that we have not free will but ''free won't.'' 
 Morse is not convinced that the Libet experiments reveal us to be helpless automatons. But he does think that the study of our decision-making powers could bear some fruit for the law. ''I'm interested,'' he says, ''in people who suffer from drug addictions, psychopaths and people who have intermittent explosive disorder -- that's people who have no general rationality problem other than they just go off.'' In other words, Morse wants to identify the neural triggers that make people go postal. ''Suppose we could show that the higher deliberative centers in the brain seem to be disabled in these cases,'' he says. ''If these are people who cannot control episodes of gross irrationality, we've learned something that might be relevant to the legal ascription of responsibility.'' That doesn't mean they would be let off the hook, he emphasizes: ''You could give people a prison sentence and an opportunity to get fixed.'' IV. Putting the Unconscious on Trial: If debates over criminal responsibility long predate the f.M.R.I., so do debates over the use of lie-detection technology. What's new is the prospect that lie detectors in the courtroom will become much more accurate, and correspondingly more intrusive. There are, at the moment, two lie-detection technologies that rely on neuroimaging, although the value and accuracy of both are sharply contested. The first, developed by Lawrence Farwell in the 1980s, is known as ''brain fingerprinting.'' Subjects put on an electrode-filled helmet that measures a brain wave called p300, which, according to Farwell, changes its frequency when people recognize images, pictures, sights and smells. After showing a suspect pictures of familiar places and measuring his p300 activation patterns, government officials could, at least in theory, show a suspect pictures of places he may or may not have seen before -- a Qaeda training camp, for example, or a crime scene -- and compare the activation patterns. (By detecting not only lies but also honest cases of forgetfulness, the technology could expand our very idea of lie detection.)
 The second lie-detection technology uses f.M.R.I. machines to compare the brain activity of liars and truth tellers. It is based on a test called Guilty Knowledge, developed by Daniel Langleben at the University of Pennsylvania in 2001. Langleben gave subjects a playing card before they entered the magnet and told them to answer no to a series of questions, including whether they had the card in question. Langleben and his colleagues found that certain areas of the brain lighted up when people lied. 
 Two companies, No Lie MRI and Cephos, are now competing to refine f.M.R.I. lie-detection technology so that it can be admitted in court and commercially marketed. I talked to Steven Laken, the president of Cephos, which plans to begin selling its products this year. ''We have two to three people who call every single week,'' he told me. ''They're in legal proceedings throughout the world, and they're looking to bolster their credibility.'' Laken said the technology could have ''tremendous applications'' in civil and criminal cases. On the government side, he said, the technology could replace highly inaccurate polygraphs in screening for security clearances, as well as in trying to identify suspected terrorists' native languages and close associates. ''In lab studies, we've been in the 80- to 90-percent-accuracy range,'' Laken says. This is similar to the accuracy rate for polygraphs, which are not considered sufficiently reliable to be allowed in most legal cases. Laken says he hopes to reach the 90-percent- to 95-percent-accuracy range -- which should be high enough to satisfy the Supreme Court's standards for the admission of scientific evidence. Judy Illes, director of Neuroethics at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, says, ''I would predict that within five years, we will have technology that is sufficiently reliable at getting at the binary question of whether someone is lying that it may be utilized in certain legal settings.'' 
 If and when lie-detection f.M.R.I.'s are admitted in court, they will raise vexing questions of self-incrimination and privacy. Hank Greely, a law professor and head of the Stanford Center for Law and the Biosciences, notes that prosecution and defense witnesses might have their credibility questioned if they refused to take a lie-detection f.M.R.I., as might parties and witnesses in civil cases. Unless courts found the tests to be shocking invasions of privacy, like stomach pumps, witnesses could even be compelled to have their brains scanned. And equally vexing legal questions might arise as neuroimaging technologies move beyond telling whether or not someone is lying and begin to identify the actual content of memories. Michael Gazzaniga, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and author of ''The Ethical Brain,'' notes that within 10 years, neuroscientists may be able to show that there are neurological differences when people testify about their own previous acts and when they testify to something they saw. ''If you kill someone, you have a procedural memory of that, whereas if I'm standing and watch you kill somebody, that's an episodic memory that uses a different part of the brain,'' he told me. Even if witnesses don't have their brains scanned, neuroscience may lead judges and jurors to conclude that certain kinds of memories are more reliable than others because of the area of the brain in which they are processed. Further into the future, and closer to science fiction, lies the possibility of memory downloading. ''One could even, just barely, imagine a technology that might be able to 'read out' the witness's memories, intercepted as neuronal firings, and translate it directly into voice, text or the equivalent of a movie,'' Hank Greely writes. 
 Greely acknowledges that lie-detection and memory-retrieval technologies like this could pose a serious challenge to our freedom of thought, which is now defended largely by the First Amendment protections for freedom of expression. ''Freedom of thought has always been buttressed by the reality that you could only tell what someone thought based on their behavior,'' he told me. ''This technology holds out the possibility of looking through the skull and seeing what's really happening, seeing the thoughts themselves.'' According to Greely, this may challenge the principle that we should be held accountable for what we do, not what we think. ''It opens up for the first time the possibility of punishing people for their thoughts rather than their actions,'' he says. ''One reason thought has been free in the harshest dictatorships is that dictators haven't been able to detect it.'' He adds, ''Now they may be able to, putting greater pressure on legal constraints against government interference with freedom of thought.''
 In the future, neuroscience could also revolutionize the way jurors are selected. Steven Laken, the president of Cephos, says that jury consultants might seek to put prospective jurors in f.M.R.I.'s. ''You could give videotapes of the lawyers and witnesses to people when they're in the magnet and see what parts of their brains light up,'' he says. A situation like this would raise vexing questions about jurors' prejudices -- and what makes for a fair trial. Recent experiments have suggested that people who believe themselves to be free of bias may harbor plenty of it all the same. 
 The experiments, conducted by Elizabeth Phelps, who teaches psychology at New York University, combine brain scans with a behavioral test known as the Implicit Association Test, or I.A.T., as well as physiological tests of the startle reflex. The I.A.T. flashes pictures of black and white faces at you and asks you to associate various adjectives with the faces. Repeated tests have shown that white subjects take longer to respond when they're asked to associate black faces with positive adjectives and white faces with negative adjectives than vice versa, and this is said to be an implicit measure of unconscious racism. Phelps and her colleagues added neurological evidence to this insight by scanning the brains and testing the startle reflexes of white undergraduates at Yale before they took the I.A.T. She found that the subjects who showed the most unconscious bias on the I.A.T. also had the highest activation in their amygdalas -- a center of threat perception -- when unfamiliar black faces were flashed at them in the scanner. By contrast, when subjects were shown pictures of familiar black and white figures -- like Denzel Washington, Martin Luther King Jr. and Conan O'Brien -- there was no jump in amygdala activity. 
 The legal implications of the new experiments involving bias and neuroscience are hotly disputed. Mahzarin R. Banaji, a psychology professor at Harvard who helped to pioneer the I.A.T., has argued that there may be a big gap between the concept of intentional bias embedded in law and the reality of unconscious racism revealed by science. When the gap is ''substantial,'' she and the U.C.L.A. law professor Jerry Kang have argued, ''the law should be changed to comport with science'' -- relaxing, for example, the current focus on intentional discrimination and trying to root out unconscious bias in the workplace with ''structural interventions,'' which critics say may be tantamount to racial quotas. One legal scholar has cited Phelps's work to argue for the elimination of peremptory challenges to prospective jurors -- if most whites are unconsciously racist, the argument goes, then any decision to strike a black juror must be infected with racism. Much to her displeasure, Phelps's work has been cited by a journalist to suggest that a white cop who accidentally shot a black teenager on a Brooklyn rooftop in 2004 must have been responding to a hard-wired fear of unfamiliar black faces -- a version of the amygdala made me do it.
 Phelps herself says it's ''crazy'' to link her work to cops who shoot on the job and insists that it is too early to use her research in the courtroom. ''Part of my discomfort is that we haven't linked what we see in the amygdala or any other region of the brain with an activity outside the magnet that we would call racism,'' she told me. ''We have no evidence whatsoever that activity in the brain is more predictive of things we care about in the courtroom than the behaviors themselves that we correlate with brain function.'' In other words, just because you have a biased reaction to a photograph doesn't mean you'll act on those biases in the workplace. Phelps is also concerned that jurors might be unduly influenced by attention-grabbing pictures of brain scans. ''Frank Keil, a psychologist at Yale, has done research suggesting that when you have a picture of a mechanism, you have a tendency to overestimate how much you understand the mechanism,'' she told me. Defense lawyers confirm this phenomenon. ''Here was this nice color image we could enlarge, that the medical expert could point to,'' Christopher Plourd, a San Diego criminal defense lawyer, told The Los Angeles Times in the early 1990s. ''It documented that this guy had a rotten spot in his brain. The jury glommed onto that.''
 Other scholars are even sharper critics of efforts to use scientific experiments about unconscious bias to transform the law. ''I regard that as an extraordinary claim that you could screen potential jurors or judges for bias; it's mind-boggling,'' I was told by Philip Tetlock, professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkley. Tetlock has argued that split-second associations between images of African-Americans and negative adjectives may reflect ''simple awareness of the social reality'' that ''some groups are more disadvantaged than others.'' He has also written that, according to psychologists, ''there is virtually no published research showing a systematic link between racist attitudes, overt or subconscious, and real-world discrimination.'' (A few studies show, Tetlock acknowledges, that openly biased white people sometimes sit closer to whites than blacks in experiments that simulate job hiring and promotion.) ''A light bulb going off in your brain means nothing unless it's correlated with a particular output, and the brain-scan stuff, heaven help us, we have barely linked that with anything,'' agrees Tetlock's co-author, Amy Wax of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. ''The claim that homeless people light up your amygdala more and your frontal cortex less and we can infer that you will systematically dehumanize homeless people -- that's piffle.'' V. Are You Responsible for What You Might Do?: The attempt to link unconscious bias to actual acts of discrimination may be dubious. But are there other ways to look inside the brain and make predictions about an individual's future behavior? And if so, should those discoveries be employed to make us safer? Efforts to use science to predict criminal behavior have a disreputable history. In the 19th century, the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso championed a theory of ''biological criminality,'' which held that criminals could be identified by physical characteristics, like large jaws or bushy eyebrows. Nevertheless, neuroscientists are trying to find the factors in the brain associated with violence. PET scans of convicted murderers were first studied in the late 1980s by Adrian Raine, a professor of psychology at the University of Southern California; he found that their prefrontal cortexes, areas associated with inhibition, had reduced glucose metabolism and suggested that this might be responsible for their violent behavior. In a later study, Raine found that subjects who received a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, which correlates with violent behavior, had 11 percent less gray matter in their prefrontal cortexes than control groups of healthy subjects and substance abusers. His current research uses f.M.R.I.'s to study moral decision-making in psychopaths.
 Neuroscience, it seems, points two ways: it can absolve individuals of responsibility for acts they've committed, but it can also place individuals in jeopardy for acts they haven't committed -- but might someday. ''This opens up a Pandora's box in civilized society that I'm willing to fight against,'' says Helen S. Mayberg, a professor of psychiatry, behavioral sciences and neurology at Emory University School of Medicine, who has testified against the admission of neuroscience evidence in criminal trials. ''If you believe at the time of trial that the picture informs us about what they were like at the time of the crime, then the picture moves forward. You need to be prepared for: 'This spot is a sign of future dangerousness,' when someone is up for parole. They have a scan, the spot is there, so they don't get out. It's carved in your brain.'' 
 Other scholars see little wrong with using brain scans to predict violent tendencies and sexual predilections -- as long as the scans are used within limits. ''It's not necessarily the case that if predictions work, you would say take that guy off the street and throw away the key,'' says Hank Greely, the Stanford law professor. ''You could require counseling, surveillance, G.P.S. transmitters or warning the neighbors. None of these are necessarily benign, but they beat the heck out of preventative detention.'' Greely has little doubt that predictive technologies will be enlisted in the war on terror -- perhaps in radical ways. ''Even with today's knowledge, I think we can tell whether someone has a strong emotional reaction to seeing things, and I can certainly imagine a friend-versus-foe scanner. If you put everyone who reacts badly to an American flag in a concentration camp or Guantanamo, that would be bad, but in an occupation situation, to mark someone down for further surveillance, that might be appropriate.''
 Paul Root Wolpe, who teaches social psychiatry and psychiatric ethics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, says he anticipates that neuroscience predictions will move beyond the courtroom and will be used to make predictions about citizens in all walks of life. 
 ''Will we use brain imaging to track kids in school because we've discovered that certain brain function or morphology suggests aptitude?'' he asks. ''I work for NASA, and imagine how helpful it might be for NASA if it could scan your brain to discover whether you have a good enough spatial sense to be a pilot.'' Wolpe says that brain imaging might eventually be used to decide if someone is a worthy foster or adoptive parent -- a history of major depression and cocaine abuse can leave telltale signs on the brain, for example, and future studies might find parts of the brain that correspond to nurturing and caring. 
 The idea of holding people accountable for their predispositions rather than their actions poses a challenge to one of the central principles of Anglo-American jurisprudence: namely, that people are responsible for their behavior, not their proclivities -- for what they do, not what they think. ''We're going to have to make a decision about the skull as a privacy domain,'' Wolpe says. Indeed, Wolpe serves on the board of an organization called the Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics, a group of neuroscientists, legal scholars and privacy advocates ''dedicated to protecting and advancing freedom of thought in the modern world of accelerating neurotechnologies.'' 
 There may be similar ''cognitive liberty'' battles over efforts to repair or enhance broken brains. A remarkable technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation, for example, has been used to stimulate or inhibit specific regions of the brain. It can temporarily alter how we think and feel. Using T.M.S., Ernst Fehr and Daria Knoch of the University of Zurich temporarily disrupted each side of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in test subjects. They asked their subjects to participate in an experiment that economists call the ultimatum game. One person is given $20 and told to divide it with a partner. If the partner rejects the proposed amount as too low, neither person gets any money. Subjects whose prefrontal cortexes were functioning properly tended to reject offers of $4 or less: they would rather get no money than accept an offer that struck them as insulting and unfair. But subjects whose right prefrontal cortexes were suppressed by T.M.S. tended to accept the $4 offer. Although the offer still struck them as insulting, they were able to suppress their indignation and to pursue the selfishly rational conclusion that a low offer is better than nothing. 
 Some neuroscientists believe that T.M.S. may be used in the future to enforce a vision of therapeutic justice, based on the idea that defective brains can be cured. ''Maybe somewhere down the line, a badly damaged brain would be viewed as something that can heal, like a broken leg that needs to be repaired,'' the neurobiologist Robert Sapolsky says, although he acknowledges that defining what counts as a normal brain is politically and scientifically fraught. Indeed, efforts to identify normal and abnormal brains have been responsible for some of the darkest movements in the history of science and technology, from phrenology to eugenics. ''How far are we willing to go to use neurotechnology to change people's brains we consider disordered?'' Wolpe asks. ''We might find a part of the brain that seems to be malfunctioning, like a discrete part of the brain operative in violent or sexually predatory behavior, and then turn off or inhibit that behavior using transcranial magnetic stimulation.'' Even behaviors in the normal range might be fine-tuned by T.M.S.: jurors, for example, could be made more emotional or more deliberative with magnetic interventions. Mark George, an adviser to the Cephos company and also director of the Medical University of South Carolina Center for Advanced Imaging Research, has submitted a patent application for a T.M.S. procedure that supposedly suppresses the area of the brain involved in lying and makes a person less capable of not telling the truth.
 As the new technologies proliferate, even the neurolaw experts themselves have only begun to think about the questions that lie ahead. Can the police get a search warrant for someone's brain? Should the Fourth Amendment protect our minds in the same way that it protects our houses? Can courts order tests of suspects' memories to determine whether they are gang members or police informers, or would this violate the Fifth Amendment's ban on compulsory self-incrimination? Would punishing people for their thoughts rather than for their actions violate the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment? However astonishing our machines may become, they cannot tell us how to answer these perplexing questions. We must instead look to our own powers of reasoning and intuition, relatively primitive as they may be. As Stephen Morse puts it, neuroscience itself can never identify the mysterious point at which people should be excused from responsibility for their actions because they are not able, in some sense, to control themselves. That question, he suggests, is ''moral and ultimately legal,'' and it must be answered not in laboratories but in courtrooms and legislatures. In other words, we must answer it ourselves.

HEADLINE: Gilberto Gil Hears The Future, Some Rights Reserved

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: SALVADOR, Brazil 

 BODY:
ON Wednesday the Brazilian minister of culture, Gilberto Gil, is scheduled to speak about intellectual property rights, digital media and related topics at the South by Southwest Music and Media Conference in Austin, Tex. Two nights later the singer, songwriter and pop star Gilberto Gil begins a three-week North American concert tour.
 Rarely do the worlds of politics and the arts converge as unconventionally as in the person of Mr. Gil, whose itinerary includes a solo performance at Carnegie Hall on March 20. More than 40 years after he first picked up a guitar and sang in public, Gilberto Passos Gil Moreira is an anomaly: He doesn't just make music, he also makes policy.
 And as the music, film and publishing industries struggle to adapt to the challenge of content proliferating on the Internet, Mr. Gil has emerged as a central player in the global search for more flexible forms of distributing artistic works. In the process his twin roles have sometimes generated competing priorities that he has sought to harmonize. 
 As a creator of music, he is interested in protecting copyrights. But as a government official in a developing country celebrated for the creative pulse of its people, Mr. Gil also wants Brazilians to have unfettered access to new technologies to make and disseminate art, without having to surrender their rights to the large companies that dominate the culture industry.
 ''I think we are moving rapidly toward the obsolescence and eventual disappearance of a single traditional model and its replacement by others that are hybrids,'' Mr. Gil said in a February interview at his home here in northeast Brazil, one day before the start of Carnival. ''My personal view is that digital culture brings with it a new idea of intellectual property, and that this new culture of sharing can and should inform government policies.''
 Raised in the poor, arid interior of the Brazilian northeast, Mr. Gil, 64, has been straddling disparate worlds most of his life. No black Brazilian had ever served as a cabinet minister before he was appointed four years ago, and as a young man fresh out of college he worked for a multinational company at a time when few black Brazilians had access to such jobs. Later, during a military dictatorship, he was jailed and then forced into exile in Britain.
 After returning to Brazil in the 1970s he made records that urged black Brazilians to reconnect with their African roots, and was an early champion here of Bob Marley and reggae. But Mr. Gil has also read widely in Asian philosophy and religions and follows a macrobiotic diet, leading the songwriter, producer and critic Nelson Motta to describe his style as ''Afro-Zen.''
 In person Mr. Gil is warm, calm and engaging, a slim, dreadlocked figure with an elfin, humorous quality that tends to disarm critics. As both individual and artist he has always tended to be open-minded and eclectic in his tastes; the poet Torquato Neto once said of him, ''There are many ways of singing and making Brazilian music, and Gilberto Gil prefers all of them.''
 A fascination with technology has been another constant in Mr. Gil's long career. He wrote his first song about computers, called ''Electronic Brain,'' back in the 1960s, and has regularly returned to the theme in compositions like ''Satellite Dish'' and ''On the Internet,'' which was written in the early 1990s and contains this verse:
 I want to get on the Web
 Promote a debate
 Bring together on the Internet
 A group of fans from Connecticut
 I want to go on the Web to contact
 Homes in Nepal and bars in Gabon
 ''I don't think there is anyone quite like Gil anywhere in the world,'' said John Perry Barlow, the former Grateful Dead lyricist who is a friend and the co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, one of the groups in the forefront of the drive to reform the current intellectual property rights system. ''He's a spearhead. He's been thinking about I.P. issues forever and clearly gets the importance of all of this. But he's also in a unique position to implement his ideas.''
 One of Mr. Gil's first actions after becoming culture minister in 2003 was to form an alliance between Brazil and the nascent Creative Commons movement. Founded in 2001, Creative Commons is meant to offer an alternative to the traditional copyright system of ''all rights reserved,'' which the movement's adherents -- from scientists and artists to lawyers and consumers -- believe has impeded creativity and the sharing of knowledge in the Internet age.
 In its place Creative Commons has devised a more flexible structure that allows artists to decide what part of their copyright they wish to retain and what part they are willing to share with the public. With input from Mr. Gil and many others, the organization has created licenses that permit creators and consumers to copy, remix or sample a digital work of art, so long as the originator is properly credited.
 More than 145 million works have been registered with Creative Commons licenses, including videos, photographs, written texts, blogs and of course music. Because Brazil is ''a country that has music in its genetic code,'' to use Mr. Barlow's phrase, and because Brazilian music has become a global force, the idea of loosening the automatic control of artistic works by a handful of conglomerates headquartered a hemisphere away has resonated strongly here.
 ''Look at remixing on music sites, which has become a core of creativity on the Internet and produced a huge archive of legally usable music,'' said Lawrence Lessig, the author of ''Free Culture'' and founder of Creative Commons. ''That has allowed a whole bunch of people to display themselves as artists and be picked up by record labels and Web sites, and all of that began because Gil got us to think about what kind of freedom was necessary for music.''
 As culture minister Mr. Gil has also sponsored an initiative called the Cultural Points program. Small government grants are issued to scores of community centers in poor neighborhoods of some of Brazil's largest cities to install recording and video studios and teach residents how to use them.
 The result has been an outpouring of video and music, much of it racially conscious and politically tinged rap or electronica. Since Brazilian commercial radio, which is said to be riddled with payola, will not play the new music, the creators instead broadcast their songs on community radio stations and distribute their CDs independently, at markets and fairs, rather than through existing record labels.
 With that project, ''you're now creating freely licensed content and demonstrating the creativity latent in the society,'' Mr. Lessig said.
 Brazil's official stance on digital content and intellectual property rights is in large part derived from Mr. Gil's own experience. In the late '60s he and his close friend Caetano Veloso, along with a handful of others here and in Sao Paulo, started the movement known as Tropicalismo, which blended avant-garde poetry, pop influences from abroad and home-grown musical styles then scorned as corny and declasse.
 In a way, the Tropicalistas engaged in sampling before digital sampling existed, using cut-and-paste, mix-and-match collage techniques that are common now but were considered bizarre at the time. In recent years their music and approach has been embraced by pop performers as diverse as David Byrne, Nirvana, Beck, Nelly Furtado and Devendra Banhart.
 When ''world music'' first appeared in the United States and Europe and Mr. Byrne, Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel and others began incorporating Brazilian rhythms into their work, Mr. Gil was initially skeptical of the phenomenon, complaining of ''cultural safaris'' by adventurers in Land Rovers ''looking for all the rare specimens.'' But thanks in large part to technological advances, he said, that practice has ''changed completely,'' and pop stars are now ''more respectful'' of other cultures. 
 ''Today the hegemony of the North has, in a certain form, been broken,'' he said. ''Local tendencies are allowed to manifest themselves and adopt their own languages and forms of packaging. It's no longer that vision of transforming some regional raw material into a single, standardized product. Today you have all kinds of local scenes that utilize universal elements,'' like Brazilian, South African and Arab rap.
 As a Tropicalista, Mr. Gil was also involved in an episode that is Brazil's equivalent of Bob Dylan being booed at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. When the Tropicalistas played electric guitars and rock rhythms at a Sao Paulo song festival in 1967, they were jeered and accused of being agents of American imperialism who were trying to impose noxious foreign influences on Brazilian music.
 Mr. Gil's complaints about the inequities of copyrights are derived in part from his own experience. Like many other musicians he signed contracts early in his career that essentially gave away publishing rights to the songs he wrote. But he waged a seven-year court battle to regain his rights, which ended recently with a favorable ruling that opens the door for other Brazilian artists to regain their rights as well.
 ''The old contracts were completely concessionary, in which all rights over the work were ceded to the contract holder, in absolute form,'' he said. ''I fought to bring my own work back under my control, arguing that there exists a unilateral right to break the contract. And we won. It was the first time this happened in Brazil, based on an artist's rescinding a contract, and without a negotiated accord.''
 Now that Mr. Gil has regained ownership of his own catalog of more than 400 songs, he is putting the concept of ''copyleft,'' as the alternative system is sometimes called, into practice. He retains all rights on some songs, some rights on others and declaring ''no rights reserved'' on others, which are now free for others for use in remixes or videos.
 With such an approach an artist ''no longer needs to transfer the administration of his rights to an entity called the record company, the movie studio or the song publisher,'' Mr. Gil said. ''He can do it himself.''
 DESPITE all his brushes with politics over the years, it was only at the end of the '80s, when he was elected to the City Council here in Brazil's third-largest city, that Mr. Gil ventured into conventional party politics. His constituency was an unusual mixture of poor and working-class blacks and middle-class, mostly white, environmentalists.
 But he withdrew after one term, turning aside requests he run for Brazil's Congress by saying he was tired of partisan bickering and wanted to resume his performing career. Many Brazilians were therefore surprised when he jumped back into politics after the country's first left-wing government was elected in 2002 and he was offered the cabinet post of culture minister, and then again late last year when he agreed to stay on for a second term.
 ''I still don't like politics,'' he said. ''I'd rather see my position in the government as that of an administrator or manager. But politics is a necessary ingredient. You have politics in the government, with ministers, on the issue of how the budget is divided, the cake sliced up, the distribution of resources. You have to choose priorities, to tend to some and not to others.''
 Mr. Gil's tenure has not been without controversy. He is a member of the Green Party, not the ruling Workers' Party, so when he was first appointed, some party loyalists were miffed that the job had not gone to one of their own, and responded with manifestos criticizing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's choice of a pop star thought to be ideologically suspect.
 ''You have to remember that Tropicalismo was fought by the traditional Stalinist left, and that even today some of those same people are in the Workers Party and the unions,'' said Mr. Motta, who is also the author of ''Tropical Nights,'' a history of Brazilian popular music since the 1960s. ''They want to bring culture under state control and know nothing about the digital world and the Internet, so of course they oppose a true revolutionary like Gil, who has always pushed for new things.''
 Since Mr. Gil became minister, Brazilian government spending on culture has grown by more than 50 percent, testimony both to his prestige and negotiating skills. As minister he has devoted time to selling Brazilian music abroad, but has also labored to draw attention to Brazilian film, painting, sculpture and literature in foreign markets.
 ''One thing to remember about Gil,'' said Hermano Vianna, an anthropologist, writer and a leading figure in Brazil's digital culture movement, is that ''he sees culture not just as art, but also as an industry. To Gil culture is not just an accessory but an important part of the economy and even a motor of economic development.''
 Over the last four years, though, Mr. Gil has cut way back on his own performances, the part of being a musician he says he enjoys most, and nearly stopped recording. His most recent disc, ''Gil Luminoso,'' is a collection of 15 of his songs, including ''Electronic Brain,'' that he rerecorded in 1999 with just voice and guitar, to accompany a book about him.
 Why give up something as gratifying as playing music for the wear and tear of public administration? ''Life is not just pleasure,'' he said. ''The first phrase of the Vedic scriptures is that 'All is suffering.' Difficulty is stimulating, challenging, it's an element of the pulse of life.''
 Besides, he is at a point in life ''where I no longer want to have a commitment to my career, in the classical sense of a profession,'' he said. ''I no longer see music as a field to be exploited. I see it now as an alternative area of action, part of a broad repertory of possibilities that I have. Music is something visceral in me, something that exudes from me, and even when I'm not thinking about it, I will still be making music, always.''

 BODY:
My husband and I are planning a trip to Croatia in the summer. We would like to spend some time in Rome on the way. Our miles are on American. Can you suggest the best way to travel from New York to Rome, from Rome to Split and from Split to New York? -- Sarah Gillespie, Westport, Conn. 
 Multi-leg itineraries are generally best handled through a good travel agent. But as there are no direct flights between Split and New York, I suggest your most cost-effective option is to book separate round-trip tickets from New York to Rome, and from Rome to Split.
 How you travel to Rome depends on how important it is to use your American AAdvantage miles compared with getting the best fare and most convenient routing. Ask American whether award seats are available when you wish to travel (there are often blackout periods in summer months), then check fares. You may wish to use your miles in some other way. 
 Go to American Airlines (www.aa.com) to check AAdvantage partner airlines. These include members of the OneWorld alliance, like British Airways (except for trans-Atlantic routes) and Iberia. American AAdvantage members must spend from 40,000 to 100,000 miles (depending on whether they are flying during peak or off-peak periods) to obtain a round-trip economy-class ticket between the United States and Europe.
 In recent Web searches, American Airlines listed fares of $1,308 and $1,611 for round-trip direct flights from New York to Rome in June and July. On Orbitz.com, there were direct flights for $941 on Eurofly and $1,263 on Alitalia -- neither of which would earn you AAdvantage miles --and a one-stop, via Madrid, on Iberia for $988, on which you could earn or redeem miles. At the start of March, round trips from Rome to Split on Croatia Airlines in early July ranged from 212 to 570 euros ($340 to $752 at $1.35 to the euro) on www.opodo.it.
 Breaking your trip into two separate segments may seem unnecessarily complicated, but it should save you a significant amount. A quick check on www.kayak.com for the lowest fare in mid July on a New York-Rome-Split-New York ticket (with a four-day layover in Rome) turned up one for $2,551 on Lufthansa (not a OneWorld partner, by the way), and that flight required a layover in Frankfurt between Rome and Split, in both directions.

HEADLINE: Mr. Wicked

BYLINE: By Alex Witchel. 
Alex Witchel is a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
Before seeing the Broadway musical ''Wicked'' for the 25th time, Gregory Maguire, who wrote the novel ''Wicked,'' was in the lobby of the Gershwin Theater last month persuading people not to read it. Granted, the people were 9, 10 and 13, and Maguire was telling their respective mothers that the book could be ''a destination read for freshman year in college.'' But when he saw the girls' hangdog faces, he conceded that, if their mothers read it first and approved, they might try it at 16 instead.
That's because ''Wicked,'' the novel, has no shortage of sex or politics. An intricately imagined expansion of L. Frank Baum's ''Wizard of Oz,'' it leaves Dorothy in the dust to tell the story of Elphaba (the name is a play on Baum's), a girl born green who grows up to be an intellectual activist and, eventually, the Wicked Witch of the West. Despite dabbling in terrorism and adultery, she may not, it turns out, be wicked after all. Maguire describes her socially awkward years at college, where her roommate is a blond social-climber who becomes Glinda, the witch of the north. Their unlikely friendship aside, Glinda still manages to get between Elphaba and those coveted magic slippers. 
 So after writing 10 books for children -- ''Wicked,'' published in 1995, was his first adult novel -- Maguire knows what's best for both his audiences. Besides, when it comes to readers, he can afford to wait. More than three million copies of ''Wicked''' are currently in print. He autographed a bagful of baseball caps for an adoring fan from North Carolina and made a last-minute dash for the men's room. ''This has the longest first act in the history of theater,'' he said. ''You feel every bladder-bursting minute.''
 ''Wicked,'' the musical, opened in October 2003 and, despite its elaborate physical production, is a vastly pared-down version of the novel. Elphaba, the misfit whose moral and emotional journey quickly became a magnet for girls and the women who drive them, helped the show overcome decidedly mixed reviews and turn into a megahit. Since ''Wicked'' opened, the Broadway production and three national companies have taken in nearly $500 million, and last Christmas, the show set the all-time record for a weekly gross in London's West End. 
 Marc Platt, the musical's initial producer, said: ''Part of the genius of Gregory's idea is taking a character from a beloved story in our culture, about whom we have a very specific point of view, and seeing her in a completely different light. Elphaba is very much an outsider, and Gregory tapped into that. All of us have had that feeling of being outside and wanting to be in, loved and cared about. It's a classic underdog story.'' Maguire, who had control over choosing the show's creators (the composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz, the librettist Winnie Holzman and the director Joe Mantello), seems to have bet right.
 Perhaps to balance the musical's aggressive merchandising -- a full hour before show time vendors sell everything from jewelry to golf balls emblazoned with ''Defying Gravity,'' the title of Elphaba's anthem -- the producers have assembled a teaching guide for school groups. It offers historical context for Elphaba's fight against the suppression of talking animals by a megalomaniacal wizard, placing her in the company of Sojourner Truth and Mother Jones. 
 Grand, indeed. But at this Sunday matinee, while the rest of the audience thrilled on cue to the lavish sets and costumes and roared for Julia Murney, who was in full green makeup and glorious voice as Elphaba, there was one scene that elicited little reaction, though for Maguire, it is still most resonant. Elphaba's sister, Nessarose (the Wicked Witch of the East), is in a wheelchair. Elphaba explains her sister's disability by saying: ''It's my fault. That my sister is the way she is.'' Their mother chewed milk flowers, she went on, so that Nessa wouldn't be green. Nessa came too soon, ''and our mother never woke up. None of which would ever have happened if not for me.''
 In 1954 in an Albany hospital, Maguire's mother died from complications she suffered giving birth to him, her fourth child. His father, overcome with grief, sent his children to live with relatives. Maguire spent his first six months with an aunt before she turned him over to St. Catherine's Infant Home, a local orphanage where the nuns named him Gregory the Executive for his perpetually somber expression. When Gregory was 2, his father married his mother's best friend and the family reunited, soon joined by three more children.
 ''I didn't even realize this at first,'' Maguire told me the week before we saw the show, ''but there's almost no central character in any of my 24 books who doesn't have a dead mother or a lost parent. When I hear Elphaba say, 'It's my fault,' that always seems to be the most moving part in the play. It has absolutely nothing to do with anything else. But there is, in the business of fairy tales, this idea that you are launched into the world with your mother's love. If you have a question about it, do you totter more than somebody else? Or do you walk more forcefully because you're questioning it and lean more forcefully into the questions that life provides? I don't know the answer. But I'm really conscious of the fact that I can't seem to start a novel unless the character doesn't have a mother. If the mother is still alive, if the mother was there -- what's the problem? There's nothing to write about.''
 Maguire's upbringing was an exercise in discipline and obedience and wanting to please, not only a stepmother who sounds anything but evil but that lesser-known caricature and insidiously more lethal archetype of fairy tales -- the father whose beloved wife dies and spends the rest of his life resenting the child who lived. In the rare instances that Maguire and his siblings were allowed television and watched ''The Wizard of Oz,'' he took Dorothy's experience to heart, fleeing the rigidity of his black-and-white world for the vivid colors of his imagination. He read and reread every fairy tale in the library and, between the ages of 7 and 17, wrote and illustrated more than 100 stories. 
 Perhaps most surprising was his commitment to becoming a parent himself; so many people with difficult childhoods choose not to revisit them. But Maguire, who in 2004 married Andy Newman, a painter, in one of the first legal gay marriages in Massachusetts, has structured his life around the three children the couple adopted before their marriage, when each was around the age of 12 months: the boys, Luke, now 9, and Alex, 6, came from Cambodia. Helen, now 5, who is named for Maguire's birth mother, came from Guatemala. The children call Maguire ''Ba'' -- which is not an abbreviation of Elphaba but in Khmer means ''Daddy.'' 
 ''I love that I can honor my stepmother and her sacrifices by doing the same for children who don't have mothers,'' Maguire said. ''I think it gives my kids some consolation to know that Ba was adopted, too, in part.''
 What has continued to give Maguire consolation is the world of make-believe, though for years, he fought it. ''I used to think my brain wasn't sharp enough to write for adults and I'd have to keep writing for children,'' he told me. ''When I turned 39, one year older than Helen had ever been, I finally decided I was a grown-up. The next day I started 'Wicked.' I thought, You must have a brain that works if you're older than your mother.''
 It was his childhood obsession with fairy tales, with telling stories and asking ''What if,'' that led him to realize that in Baum's books, there is no evidence to support the Wicked Witch of the West's being wicked. We are only told she is. What if she's not?
 In another scene in the musical ''Wicked,'' Elphaba the student, to her amazement and delight, is praised by the headmistress for her nascent magical powers.
 ''This weird quirk I've tried to suppress or hide is a talent?'' she asks.
 It would seem so.
 Snow becomes Concord, Mass., with its Colonial-era homes, some stunningly restored, others resolutely austere. On the outside, Maguire's house falls somewhere in between. On the inside, early on a Sunday afternoon, Maguire was a bit frantic; for the past week, Newman was in England, visiting 2 of the 12 galleries that represent his work, and Maguire was on his own. The couple do not employ a nanny, a baby sitter or a housekeeper. They decided that if they were going to have children, they were going to do everything themselves. Newman was expected back within the hour, and the children were at a friend's home. But Maguire was behind schedule preparing that night's dinner.
 ''We had an emergency moral crisis this morning,'' he said, chopping string beans. ''Alex, the 6-year-old, saw two chocolate hearts in the store and took them, even though he insisted they fell into his pocket. So we had to go back to the store to apologize and have that conversation about why he couldn't keep them.''
 That's O.K., I said, I'd just go to the bathroom while he finished up. That made him even more hyper. He rushed in before me: ''I'm checking to see if the last person flushed.'' He or she had and left behind a water pistol, fully loaded, on the sink. Maguire ran back out again and put on a kettle for tea. I waited for him in the living room, where a fire burned and the floor-to-ceiling windows revealed a winter wonderland of a backyard. I could hear him sighing strenuously in the kitchen as he finished his chores. He'd made a point of showing me where his neighbors threw out a box spring, an eyesore I couldn't see beneath the snow. Even though it was invisible, he needed me to know that something was wrong and that he had tried to fix it. 
 Finally he came in and sat by the fire, eating some cheese for his lunch and catching his breath. He is a small man with a salt-and-pepper beard, very bright brown eyes and a perpetual case of bed head, little tufts flying every which way. Despite the snow, he wore a T-shirt, jeans and purple sneakers. He looks like the kind of guidance counselor every misunderstood high-school student wishes she had, a kindred spirit who combines the safety of a grown-up with the heart of a child.
 His house, on the other hand, which he designed, looks decidedly writerly: Oriental rugs, rocking chair, overstuffed couches and that fabulous fireplace. You expect Jo March to come bounding through the door, manuscript in hand.
 We headed upstairs to Maguire's study. ''I thought, Let me spend my filthy lucre on redoing this house so we can lodge without change and the kids can grow up in it,'' he said. ''We put on the entire second floor, which wasn't here.''
 His study is a large room filled with dark wooden cupboards that hold all those stories he wrote as a child. He continues to be prolific: since ''Wicked,'' he has published nine children's books and four more adult novels, including ''Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister,'' the Cinderella story reimagined a la ''Wicked'' and made into an ABC television movie starring Stockard Channing as the evil stepmother. ''Son of a Witch,'' a sequel to ''Wicked,'' spent 14 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. Although ''Wicked'' stayed there for 26 weeks, it didn't arrive until 10 years after its publication. In one interview, Maguire joked that the musical was ''a $14 million advertising campaign for the book.'' In fact, when the novel was published in 1995, he gave a reading in Chicago for which seven people showed up.
 ''Four were homeless and had come in to get out of the snow,'' he recalled, ''two were friends of my brother's and the genuine book-buying public was reduced to one representative buyer who listened to me read, nodded affectionately and bought one book. I thought: My life is over. My career has tanked before it started.'' 
 Word of mouth eventually kicked in, and by the time the musical opened on Broadway in 2003, the book had sold 500,000 copies.
 ''I wanted to write about the nature of evil and the various ways people demonize their enemies,'' Maguire said. ''Once I got the idea of using the witch as a way to think about how we bully, I started thinking about what I knew about her. In the original 'Wizard of Oz,' the Wizard tells Dorothy, 'Remember that the witch is wicked, tremendously wicked, and ought to be killed.' Well, I found the Wizard hiding behind the curtain, sending children, effectively four children, off to kill somebody as scary as the witch.'' 
 Maguire also thought about his characters in the context of the Vietnam War. ''The draft ended seven days before I would have been eligible,'' he said, ''but I lived my entire life in fear, worried, selfishly, about being drafted and being killed, going off to fight the wicked witch of the Vietcong. The elision between the lying Wizard of Oz, who sent innocent foot soldiers to do the job that he was not willing to do himself, and Nixon was so solid in my head that it colored my antipathy to the Wizard. 
 ''I also thought of the film and imagined that the two witches had known each other a long time,'' he continued. ''As soon as I took the witch off the pedestal of being wicked and put her in a human context of having a friendship, even a friendship gone wrong, I knew she was going to be interesting. Initially I thought I was going to write a Hannibal Lecter or an Adolf Hitler. But it's quite possible that part of the success of 'Wicked' is that the witch really tries to do good. If I think, What did I pull out of myself that I put in her? it's that. Even at the age of 52, I don't stop asking, 'How can I be good in my life?' I know I'm going to need everybody else's approval.''
 Given his family history, he may feel that more keenly than others. ''My stepmother, whom I always called Mommy, and still do, she's 90, had been selected to be my godmother before my mother died,'' he said. ''So it was like an Old World thing. They were living in North Albany, and my father's health wasn't good. He'd had one or two major heart attacks early on and had been somewhat, if not fully, unemployed at the time of my mother's death. Besides me, his other children were 8, 6 and 3. My stepmother married him knowing full well she might end up having to raise his four children if he died.''
 John Maguire recovered sufficiently to take on two jobs to support what turned into a family of nine; he was a reporter and a columnist for The Times Union of Albany and a speechwriter for the New York State Department of Health. Although Maguire said that the circumstances of his mother's death were never addressed directly by either of them, it was an unspoken factor in their relationship.
 ''As I got to be a teenager, I think he found it hard to look at me because I physically resembled her,'' he said. ''I had curly hair. I was lithe and light-spirited. He was never consciously cruel, but I was the child he had the hardest time accommodating emotionally. My siblings agreed with me.''
 John Maguire died in 1986. In addition to raising seven children and working in the Sears credit department, Gregory's stepmother, Marie Maguire, wrote poetry (as Marie McAuliff), which was published in The New York Herald Tribune, among other publications. Maguire said: ''In many ways, her attention to my use of language in my early efforts at creative writing had more effect than my father's attention. In fact, my father didn't pay too much attention. My mother trained my eye and my ear to the precise word.''
 Maguire said that Marie was always clear about who his parents were. ''One of my earliest memories is standing in the kitchen, and she must have said something about 'I have a baby in my stomach,' and I must have said something like, 'Well, when I was in your stomach' -- and I remember her saying: 'Now, Gregory, we've talked about this before, you weren't in my stomach, you were in Helen's stomach. I'm your second mother.' And that was the phrase we used, second mother, not stepmother. I remember saying, 'I know that.' And I did. The words were familiar. But the reason the memory has stuck in my head is that it was the first time I knew what the words meant. The notion of separation, of being apart from the nurturer. Even right in the same room, in some way, I was apart from her.''
 One effect of his mother's death, Maguire said, was how strict the rules became in the house. None of the children were allowed to ride a bicycle until they turned 16 and had passed the New York State driver's-license exam. ''My parents were afraid we'd be killed,'' he said. ''For many years what I thought of as my father's irrational irascibility was just terror that somebody else would die. When I realized that, I began to forgive him.''
 Maguire attended the University of Albany on a scholarship and published his first novel for children, ''The Lightning Time,'' when he was 25. That was when he began grappling with his sexuality. ''I thought: I'm not going to be married, I'm not going to have children. Am I even going to be alive? Because I just could not see it. I didn't know anybody who was gay. The word never came up in my North Albany Irish-Catholic culture. I didn't know many of the writers I was reading were gay. I didn't know unless it said so on the back spine. I was clueless.''
 Maguire moved to Boston and received a master's degree in children's literature at Simmons College, where he taught for eight years. He found a partner with whom he had an 18-year relationship and earned a Ph.D. in English literature from Tufts University. He wrote his dissertation on children's fantasy from 1933 to 1989. ''I had one major thesis,'' he said. ''Far from being escapist, children's fantasy always has been a lot more attuned to the social and political realities of the 20th century than we like to think. So it was not such a surprise that within a few years I would begin writing 'Wicked' and use the material of children's fantasy to talk about the political world in which I found myself.''
 Interestingly, Maguire says none of his children have asked why they have two dads and no mom. ''Luke, in particular, knows that most families have a dad and a mom,'' Maguire said. ''But he thinks we're really nice guys and we're sharp about some things, but none too swift about what the family makeup should be, and he's too polite to mention that one of us is supposed to be a woman. Of course, if he ever rocked the boat and pointed it out, that might mean one of us would leave. I used to say this as a joke, and like most jokes the more I said it, the more I thought, I bet there's some truth to it.''
 The garage door rumbled open -- Newman had returned from London and gone to pick up the children -- and within seconds, Helen was in Maguire's lap. ''Can you say, 'Good afternoon?' '' he asked her.
 ''Good afternoon,'' she said seriously. She looked up at Maguire. As the sole female in the house, she has already perfected a slightly exasperated expression at the plight of being surrounded by hapless males. ''Where's my library card?'' she asked.
 Maguire looked blank and got up to search for it. Helen waited patiently until he found it. ''I'm putting it here,'' she said, jamming it into her piggy bank for safekeeping.
 Dinner and baths followed in quick succession. Newman, who is 51, can look very much like the lawyer he used to be when he's listening or concentrating. But when he laughs and his taut face opens, he looks like the artist he has become. By 6:30, Maguire was in the kitchen cooking the grown-ups' dinner while Newman sat on the couch with the kids and ''The Adventures of Tintin.'' He held the large, illustrated volume in one hand and a pointer in the other so they could follow as he read. Alex lay his head on Newman's chest, and above him, Helen draped herself around his neck. Luke, the eldest, sat on the other side, tall and separate, the official lookout for the three-headed creature beside him, which also sported two pairs of small, pink-soled feet. Newman read the story using accents for the different characters. Luke was riveted and Alex asked questions, while Helen was in for the cuddle. Dada, as the children call Newman, had been gone all week, and she reveled in his being home.
 When it was time for bed, no one wanted to leave. ''I'm going slowly because I'm an old lady,'' Helen said, bent over.
 ''Dada, give me a hug,'' one of the boys said at the top of the stairs. 
 ''I gave you 14 hugs,'' he said, giving each another one.
 Back in front of the fireplace with a bottle of pinot noir, the two men looked exhausted. If Maguire's road to this point has been guided by one motivating obsession, Newman's has been significantly more circuitous. The child of a foreign-service officer, he grew up in Paris, London and Rome and read history at Trinity College, Oxford, before graduating from Georgetown law school. For nearly 15 years he worked at the Washington firm Patton, Boggs & Blow, doing international trade litigation, during which time he was married to a woman. The first major change in his life was deciding to leave the law and paint. That was a significant source of friction in his first marriage, he said; sexuality was not. Newman said that Maguire is his first homosexual relationship.
 The two met in 1997 at the Blue Mountain Center, an arts colony in upstate New York. Newman was separated from his wife, and although Maguire's partner had moved to Asia for a job, Maguire intended to wait. ''Lo and behold,'' he said, happily. ''It took about two and a half weeks between meeting and falling very deeply in love.''
 Newman said: ''It completely took me by surprise. My personal soul searching about Gregory lasted about 48 hours. What was hard was how to talk about this to my own world. I was the oldest of three, top of the class, the textbook example. I had an ostensibly unblemished record.''
 Although Newman's ex-wife was supportive -- she is Luke's godmother -- his father was less so. Until the children arrived. When the couple were married in 2004, he attended the wedding, as did Maguire's stepmother. Now both men are thriving in their work; Newman recently bought a house in the south of France, noting that some of his former law partners remain his best collectors.
 And the phenomenon that is ''Wicked'' continues apace. Last year Maguire bought a weekend house in Vermont. Well, this all sounds good, but houses in distant locations are even more work than children. Do they ever fancy themselves as globe-trotting gay blades instead of work-at-home gay dads? 
 Maguire just laughed. ''The Vermont house is big enough that we can invite our friends who have kids to spend the weekend,'' he said. ''We cook together and drink a lot of wine. The kids play together and watch videos and climb up the hill.'' He smiled wryly at Newman: ''It's just another way to make a weekend go by when we basically are imprisoned in our children's lives for the next 12 years. You do whatever you can to survive. And if it means driving three hours on a Friday and three hours on a Sunday, that's what you do. Put in the French-language tapes and offer it up to Jesus.''
 The Thoreau Elementary School, the local public school that Maguire's children attend, is one of those places where teachers and parents call one another by their first names and everyone smiles a lot. On a frigid Monday morning, Maguire was there to read some of his stories to the kindergarten and the first grade, then to talk about writing to the third grade. This was not just because he is a dutiful dad; in his less-successful publishing days, he earned most of his income on the graham-cracker circuit, speaking to elementary-school classes. It is something he's exceptionally good at.
 The younger ones came first. Maguire sat in a chair, the children on the floor. Helen planted herself at his feet while Alex, feigning independence, stayed in the back. 
 Maguire picked up his collection of fairy-tale spoofs, ''Leaping Beauty.'' ''I'm going to read 'Goldie Fox and the Three Chickens' by --'' 
 ''Gregory Maguire!'' Helen announced. He laughed, and so did the kids. ''Thank you, Helen,'' he said. He read the story animatedly as they listened, engaged. Then he talked about ''Hamster and Gerbil,'' which the class quickly identified as Hansel and Gretel. ''Their parents are beavers, but they're adopted,'' Maguire explained. ''Their father is about to marry a porcupine who wants to send them out into the woods.'' 
 Though the kids laughed uproariously, hearing him say it landed like a slap -- one that keeps on stinging. In ''Wicked,'' when Nessarose is killed by Dorothy's flying house, Elphaba longs for her sister's jeweled slippers, not because ''their magic must be very powerful,'' as Glinda surmises in the movie, but because they were a gift from their father. He gave them to Nessa because the milk flowers weren't her fault and he loved her more. That is their power.
 Before the class, I watched Maguire hand over a package of pennies to Alex's teacher for a class project on collections. He had included written instructions to give them away when the project was done, and he made sure she saw them. There just aren't enough good deeds in the world to give him the fresh start he seems to imagine he still needs.
 We headed to the next classroom, where 40 third graders watched as Maguire wrote on the board: ''Once upon a time is the situation.'' ''One unusual day is the complication.'' ''Luckily, is the resolution.''
 He drew pictures to illustrate a story he appeared to be improvising, ''The Hotel Bomb.'' It was about a man whose wife goes to a hotel. When he learns that the hotel is about to be bombed, he sets off to save her. 
 As Maguire went on, he was barraged by questions, the answers to which he seemed to incorporate into the story. When he finished, he put down his marker and turned on a slide projector, which showed a picture of the original version of ''The Hotel Bomb,'' by Gregory Maguire, written in 1964. The kids looked surprised -- the past 15 minutes hadn't been extemporaneous after all. He showed them more stories, each with detailed drawings. ''Philip in Trouble.'' ''Some Rise by Sin.'' ''Episode in Rome.'' 
 Maguire talked until the class grew fidgety. The scope of his work, the sheer fact of his output, was more than they could digest.
 ''You realize that 'The Hotel Bomb' is a story about a journalist trying to save his wife,'' he told me as we left.
 And in the story, he does save her. But there was one boy in the class who had been visibly upset by the story's premise. Unlike the other kids who laughed harder and harder as Maguire drew the man running faster and faster toward the hotel, he waved his hand insistently until he could stand it no longer. 
 ''Why was the mother there in the first place?'' he burst out, his face filled with panic.
 Maguire stopped.
 ''I don't know,'' he said gently. ''But that's a great question.''

HEADLINE: Dubai on a Budget? No, It's Not a Mirage

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
DUBAI on a budget sounds like an oxymoron. The most ostentatious of the seven city states of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai is where travelers go to find a self-proclaimed seven-star hotel, indoor skiing and artificial islands springing up from the seas in the shape of palm trees. A stay at that ''seven-star'' hotel, the sail-shaped Burj Al Arab, starts at more than $2,000 a night. 
 Yet now a number of budget hotel chains are moving into this playground for the rich. Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the serial entrepreneur who founded the budget airline easyJet, was in Dubai two weeks ago to break ground on the first of six easyHotels to be built in the emirate. 
The hotels, based on the easyHotel model introduced in Europe in 2005, will have rooms a little bigger than those in existing easyHotels -- but still small, around 160 square feet, with just the basics, including a bed, a shower, a flat-screen television and an Internet connection. Prices won't be announced until the opening, but are expected to be around 250 to 300 dirhams, or about $67 to $80 a night at 3.75 dirhams to the dollar. 
 InterContinental Hotels plans to open its first Holiday Inn Express in Dubai this summer; with 244 rooms, the hotel will be significantly larger than its counterparts in the United States. 
 Ibis, an economy brand of Accor, the giant French hotel company, which already has one hotel in Dubai, plans to expand with a 480-room hotel there in December and a 365-room hotel in 2008. The existing Ibis World Trade Center Dubai, linked to the International Exhibition Center and Convention Center of Dubai, has rooms from around 70 euros, $95 a night at $1.35 to the euro. And Whitbread's budget brand, Premier Travel Inn, Britain's biggest hotel chain, is building a 300-room hotel at the Dubai Investments Park. Room rates are expected to be in the 400-dirham range. 
 The extreme emphasis on luxury in Dubai over the last decade is precisely why the market for budget travel is wide open. While most hotel guests continue to stay at high-end places, statistics show a growing demand for lower-priced accommodations. 
 The number of guests who stayed in five-star luxury hotels in Dubai increased just 10 percent, to nearly 2 million, in 2005 from the previous year, according to the latest statistics available online from the Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing. By contrast, the number staying in one-star, limited-service hotels jumped 32 percent in that same time, to about 600,000. 
 It's not only hotels that have taken notice of the budget traveler. Anticipating a shift toward more economical vehicles in the next few years, Hertz is adding small cars like the Honda Jazz hatchback and Toyota Yaris to its Dubai fleet -- cars that rent for about $55 a day, compared with $110 for a mid-size vehicle or $220 for an S.U.V. 
 ''The place has gotten very expensive,'' said Bob Farrow, general manager of Hertz Car Rental in Dubai. ''Everybody would love to drive a big car on vacation, but they want to pay for a small one.'' 
 Five years ago, small cars made up just 10 percent of the fleet at his outlet, but in the next year or so, Hertz plans to increase that to about 25 percent. 
 While more travel companies are catering to budget travelers in Dubai, for now it can still be difficult to find the cheaper alternatives. A call asking about budget options a couple of weeks ago left a spokeswoman flummoxed at the New York office promoting Dubai tourism. 
 ''We really focus on the high end,'' she said. ''Truly, it's a luxury market.'' 
 The head office in Dubai wasn't much more help. Asked by e-mail about typical rates and recommendations for travelers on tight budgets, Mohamed Abdul Mannan, a spokesman for the Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing, replied with just one line -- a Web address for an online article about the recent easyHotels announcement of plans to build there.
 The spectacle of modern Dubai is a product of many years of intensive development. Once a fishing and pearl-diving village, it grew into a modest commercial city in the 19th century and wasn't transformed into a metropolis until the last couple of decades. Even as Dubai's reputation as a luxury travel destination took off, savvy travelers continued to score deals -- although less remarkable ones as time went on -- even without the new influx of budget chains. 
 ''My wallet has seen the changes,'' said Jesse Long, 34, a photographer in Brooklyn who has been traveling to Dubai on business for the last five years. Hotels where he used to stay for $30 or $40 a night are now charging four times more, he said, ''and they haven't really improved anything.'' 
 To get the best deal, Mr. Long stays in the central Bur Dubai district, where modestly priced accommodations can still be found, particularly along Khalid Bin Waleed Road. Last month, he stayed at the Hotel Ascot (www.ascothoteldubai.com) in that area for about $130 a night and dined at nearby Indian restaurants for less than $5 a meal. 
 For discounted hotel accommodations, he recommends www.wired-destinations.com. 
 It's also possible to find a bargain by consulting the tourism desk at the airport, but to avoid any confusion later, be sure to get the terms in writing, including the rate and any incentives, like free breakfast. 
 Ramadan, the ninth month of the Muslim lunar calendar, when people of Muslim faith fast from dawn to dusk, can be a good time to find bargains since hotels tend to be less crowded and may be more willing to negotiate on price. (This year, the start of Ramadan, which varies slightly by region, begins around Sept. 12.)
 While working hours are slightly altered and many restaurants are closed much of the day, there is an air of festivity after dark, said Daniela Bonanno, a sales manager at Absolute Travel in New York who has visited Dubai during Ramadan. ''After sunset, everyone celebrates because that's when they can eat,'' Ms. Bonanno said. 
 Shops and malls stay open longer, and hotels and restaurants offer special Iftar buffets to break the fast. 
 If you're on a budget, you might want to avoid traveling during the wildly popular Dubai Shopping Festival, which typically runs from late December through January, when you'll face high rates as you compete for rooms with crowds of well-heeled travelers.

HEADLINE: A City Exchanges Its Cowboy Duds for a Tuxedo

BYLINE: By SUSAN CATTO

 BODY:
THERE was a time, not so many years ago, when the only reasons most tourists would bother venturing into Calgary was for the two-week rodeo festival in July or as a stop on the way to the Banff mountain resort, some 80 miles west. But this rugged city in central Alberta is undergoing an energetic revitalization brought on by an oil boom, and its population, according to the Calgary Civic Census, has increased nearly 30 percent in the last decade, to almost 992,000. 
 For visitors, all this activity means a revived downtown core with restaurants whose chefs -- and prices -- could vie with those in Toronto or Montreal; spruced-up, outlying neighborhoods; and new places to stay like the Hotel Arts near the cultural heart of the city, or, the west-end Sandman Hotel & Suites, just across from Canada Olympic Park, site of the 1988 Winter Games. But perhaps most surprising, is that the Heart of the New West, as Calgary is billing itself these days, is becoming known as a center of culture, with diverse entertainment options and an expanding museum scene. 
Calgary is home to Canada's biggest oil and gas companies and the administrative headquarters of the $50 billion oil sands extraction projects centered 470 miles north in Fort McMurray, Alberta, and is certainly not the most obvious spot for a cultural renaissance. "We've always had this image as being a city without a history, or perhaps a city without real culture,'' said Kelly Lewis, a manager at Tourism Calgary.
 Founded in 1884, Calgary's initial prosperity was based on sandstone quarries. Oil was discovered in 1914, and a boom-bust cycle repeated itself in the 1920s, 1950s, and 1980s. During busts, the city hollowed out; during booms, it was the Houston of Canada, complete with cowboy hats and swagger. But even in good times, it never had much of a reputation for cultural innovation. 
 That is changing as quickly as everything else. Some of the biggest creative names in Canada are choosing to introduce their new works in Calgary. ''Frobisher,'' an opera by John Estacio and John Murrell set in Canada's far north, had its premiere at the Calgary Opera Centre in late January. ''The Fiddle and the Drum,'' a new ballet created by Joni Mitchell with Jean Grand-Maitre, the artistic director of the Alberta Ballet, opened to sell-out audiences last month. The downtown Epcor Centre for the Performing Arts houses -- with style -- several theater and performance groups and plays host to visiting performers. This year's annual festival of new Canadian plays presented by Epcor's resident company, the Alberta Theater Projects, had three world premieres by Toronto playwrights as well as two shows by Albertans. The theatrical event of the spring is Theater Calgary's April co-production (with troupes in Toronto and Edmonton) of ''The Overcoat'' by Morris Panych and Wendy Gorling, and based on stories by Gogol and music by Shostakovich. And later this month, the Glenbow Museum will open a 24,000-square-foot gallery devoted to the modern history of Alberta. There is also a two-year-old gallery dedicated to Alberta's original inhabitants, the Blackfoot Indians, as well as an incongruous, but beautiful collection of early Asian sculpture. 
 ''There's a commitment to the cultural sector, which is being backed up by money,'' said Beth Gignac, manager of the city's arts and culture division, who herself moved to Calgary only last July from the Toronto area.
 If visitors can easily fill their nights with plays and music -- for instance, the Beat Niq Jazz & Social Club has live shows most nights and the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra keeps a busy schedule that includes Saturday morning and lunchtime concerts -- there's also plenty to see around town in the day. The honey-hued sandstone buildings lining the Stephen Avenue Walk, a pedestrian mall between First Street SW and Sixth Street SW, date from the late 1880s, after a disastrous fire led city officials to decree that all large buildings be sandstone. Today the street is filled with shops and restaurants, including the new Blink supper club and several pricey steakhouses, like the Belvedere and Saltlik, which serve the ubiquitous AAA Alberta beef, as well as the top-drawer seafood restaurant Catch. High-end Italian is Calgary's hottest flavor right now, with new restaurants like Capo in the Inglewood neighborhood and Pulcinella in Kensington garnering notice from both critics and diners.
 As condominiums spring up along the Bow River, neighborhoods on the edge of downtown are becoming destinations, too. Among the standouts in Kensington, a trendy shopping and residential area just over the Louise Bridge, is an outpost of the Calgary-based chocolatier Bernard Callebaut; Livingstone and Cavell Extraordinary Toys, which, though small, lives up to its name; and the Higher Grounds Cafe, a bustling coffeehouse among numerous independent coffee shops in this caffeinated town. This is prime shopping and strolling territory for a population prosperous enough to afford the lobster lasagna or venison chop with wild boar bacon at the local favorite Muse, but young enough to desire a bit of bohemia in their shopping district. 
 Inglewood, often cited as the next Kensington, remains a neighborhood in transition. To reach the increasingly upscale blocks of antique stores, home furnishing shops and quirky boutiques, you'll have to pass notably ungentrified blocks with dive bars, and local people say, the occasional crack house. But it's worth the walk for destination restaurants like Spolumbo's, a casual sausage house and deli founded by some local football heros, or Rouge, a romantic high-end French restaurant in a historic house. 
 The Calgary Zoo in Inglewood has not been excluded from the development surge either: with $35 million from the provincial surplus, it has opened new sections devoted to African and nocturnal animals. A new elephant area opens this summer, and a massive indoor northern ecosystem with a saltwater aquarium is planned.
 Calgary also has a small Chinatown -- no longer the main sign of cultural diversity in a city that has African, Latino and Reggae festivals as well as a full complement of international restaurants. 
 ''I've been saying since I got here, I wish they could lift off the white cowboy hat,'' said Ms. Gignac, who, like many newcomers, initially expected the city to be all western, all the time. ''There's a lot going on beneath that cowboy hat,'' she added. 
 While the beneficiaries of Calgary's boom are easy to spot, it's not all good news for long-term residents. Tom Booth, a young lawyer who was buying wine on Stephen Avenue, noted that the population influx has meant a huge rise in living costs and an encroachment on the space and independence Calgarians once took for granted. Downtown parking lots charge up to $30 a day and homes in former working-class suburbs are selling for close to $850,000, pushing out the middle class, not to mention the poor. ''It's forced Calgary to think about how to be a big city,'' Mr. Booth said.
 Meanwhile, at the long tiled bar at the fashionable Metropolitan Grill on Eighth Avenue SW at the top of Stephen Avenue's sandstone row, casually dressed young professionals -- many recent arrivals from someplace else -- were meeting and eating. But will they still be here if and when the most recent oil boom ends? 
 Gonzalo Vivanco, an engineer who came here as a child, thinks they will. 
 ''We had a boom in the '80s, but not like this,'' said Mr. Vivanco, who was enjoying a steak. ''It's just so much bigger.''
 Like many residents here, Mr. Vivanco believes that this time, with new investments-- and hard-earned wisdom -- Calgary has finally created an economy and culture appealing enough to keep newcomers in town, even if the oil boom slows.RIDING HIGHER WITH THE BOOM IN OIL

HEADLINE: One Vote For Less Worry On Wall St.

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
AFTER two weeks of nervous trading on Wall Street over concerns about the state of the economy, evidence of strong, stable growth might come in handy. One analyst expects to find it in several pieces of data this week, confirming his rosy outlook for the economy and the stock market. 
 John Lynch, chief market analyst at Evergreen Investments in Boston, said he would pay closest attention to the report on Tuesday on retail sales for February. A Bloomberg News poll of economists forecasts an increase of 0.3 percent, but Mr. Lynch is looking for a 0.5 percent gain.
Consumers have their doubts about the economy, he said, pointing to the latest University of Michigan confidence reading, which came in at a five-month low. But he suspects that they are keeping their wallets out, all the same.
 ''The retail sales number will be a classic indication of, 'It's not what I say, it's what I do,' '' he said. ''The consumer's not dead yet.''
 Neither are manufacturers, in his opinion. He foresees more strength than the consensus when February industrial production is reported on Friday. Mr. Lynch anticipates a 0.4 percent increase, while the Bloomberg poll expects a gain of 0.3 percent.
 One economic indicator that he expects to be less lively than in the recent past is inflation. If the February core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, comes in on Friday with a gain of 0.2 percent, as Mr. Lynch and the consensus expect, it will bring the year-over-year gain closer to the 2 percent level that the Federal Reserve is thought to consider best for sustainable economic growth.
 ''I get paid to worry, but when I look at the underlying fundamentals, I'm hard-pressed to see any cracks,'' he said. But cracks have appeared in the stock market, so he is less certain that a set of benign economic readings will give stocks anything more than a fleeting lift.
 ''If inflation is less than anticipated, certainly we'll see a positive reaction in equities,'' he predicted. But after an initial rally, traders ''may have second thoughts,'' he said. 
 Still, he has no such reservations about holding stocks for the longer term, given present economic conditions.
 ''What the market does on March 16, I don't care about,'' he said. ''What it does over the next several quarters is what matters. I'll invest in a low-inflation, low-interest-rate environment every time.''DATA WATCH -- Another sign of tame inflation is expected on Thursday. The Bloomberg poll predicts the core Producer Price Index for February to show an increase of 0.2 percent. 
 The next day, a dip is forecast in the University of Michigan's initial reading of consumer confidence for March, to 89.7 from 91.3 last month.

HEADLINE: Where Are the Grown-Ups When You Need Them?

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AS I write this, I am just back from the lovely town of Clinton, S.C., where I spoke at a school called Presbyterian College. I was speaking on a subject of great interest, at least to me: the image of the adolescent in mass culture. I used to teach about this area -- the political and social content of the culture -- before many of you readers were born, and I am still compelled by it.
 The conclusion I made (suggested to me by my mentor, Al Burton) is that adolescents dominate movies and television because they are the main consumers of mass culture. But far more than that, and partly because of mass culture, adolescents, with their short attention spans, their demand for a painless life, their need to blame everyone else for their problems, and their perpetual sense of victimization despite having just been given new Beemers, are the model for the whole society right now.
This hits hard in the current economic world. For example, the stock market has lately been turbulent in a downward direction. After years of smooth sailing, waves of selling have been happening occasionally, sending prices lower. On the business news channels and in print, investors/speculators are whining like kids who have just been grounded for coming home drunk. 
 But look at it the way a grown-up would. Broad cross-sections of stocks wildly -- wildly -- outperform cash, Treasuries and corporate bonds over long periods. Why do stocks offer such ''excess returns?'' Because their standard deviation of return is much higher than that of cash or bonds. In other words, you get paid a lot to go through the gut-wrenching rides like those we have had lately. If we did not have those times, stocks would be priced so that they would not have excess returns. 
 The last few weeks are the price of admission to this club. It's that simple. Get used to it. If you want to be in the market, remember why you get those returns. That would be the grown-up way to handle it -- so, naturally, we handle it the adolescent way.
 Second, perhaps you have noticed the collapse of the subprime mortgage market -- or at least its substantial correction. Well, a long time ago, I was friends with the owner of a subprime mortgage issuer. The whole deal was that the issuer was paid a lot of points and fees and higher interest to take on that risk. When the company saw the difference between subprime and prime diminish, he simply left the business. He would not have been paid for risk, so he left the field a superrich man. 
 Now, the holders of subprime collateralized debt obligations are whining and complaining about the fall in their bonds. But what did they think they were buying? Why did they think they got those higher interest rates? They were called ''subprime'' for a reason. It was adolescent behavior to think they could both have higher returns and not have any greater risk than the prime mortgage space. (And it was pure magical thinking to think that risk had disappeared from issuing mortgages to unqualified buyers, or that if you put a lot of unqualified buyers together into a pool, the risk would somehow be eliminated -- as if you had put a lot of dogs together and expected some to be cats.)
 But wait a minute. What is a junk bond if not a loan to a subprime borrower? Why do lenders think that those bonds are called ''below investment grade?'' It's not just a formality or a quaint term. Over long periods, junk bonds really do default at rates far greater than investment-grade bonds. That's why smart lenders used to demand very substantial premiums for making those loans.
 Now, in a mania of adolescent ''we know better than our stodgy parents'' behavior, lenders lend to junk borrowers for not wildly more than they charge Exxon Mobil.
 Where did the grown-ups go? In case one of those super-well-paid lenders has been skiing in Gstaad and is recuperating after hitting a mogul the wrong way, he may want to read W. Braddock Hickman's encyclopedic work, ''Corporate Bond Quality and Investor Experience'' (out of print but well worth tracking down). The results are just what adults would expect: there are not excess returns in junk except in very rare periods because of the default risk. Again, where have the people who behave like parents gone? Is the correction in subprime ringing any bells in the junk-bond world? Heck, no. Party on, dude.
 And we can look even higher up the tree. It used to be assumed that along with great power in the corporate world came great responsibility. To stockholders above all that duty was owed. That was how grown-ups played the game.
 But to the adolescent mind, everything is owed and nothing is owed in return. To the adolescent mind, it's all about what can you do to feed a bottomless maw of self-regard. How else to explain the collapse of ethical standards in terms of excessive C.E.O. compensation, backdating of options, spring-loading, lavish-beyond-words severance packages for failed C.E.O.'s?
 Finally, and most discouragingly, what about the very top of the heap? It used to be assumed that the Chief Magistrate of the Nation owed it to us to tell us bad news, to make the government work responsibly and parsimoniously. It used to be thought that while a politician would promise anything to get a vote, some measure of responsibility was required once he or she was in office. 
 How quaint. For a good 30 years now, at least since Gerald R. Ford left office, we have had a leadership style that said to the citizens, ''You can buy it, go on try it, you can pay me next week'' (as the immortal Chuck Berry would say). Or, more precisely, ''You can have it all and it doesn't cost a thing.''
 We can lower taxes and get more revenue. We can fight a war with grossly inadequate plans and resources and win anyway. We can trust business to regulate itself because, in our time, businesspeople have become self-regulating unselfish madonnas. We can run deficits of $800 billion a year in foreign trade and there won't be any adverse consequences.
 BUT to the adolescent mind, of course, actions are divorced from consequences because Mom and Dad are always there to make it right.
 Guess what: we're the Moms and Dads now, and if we don't act like it, there will be consequences aplenty.
 Again, are there any grown-ups in the house? Anyone? Anyone?

HEADLINE: Knowledge Is Power Only if You Know How to Use It

BYLINE: By DENISE CARUSO. 
Denise Caruso is executive director of the Hybrid Vigor Institute, which studies collaborative problem-solving. E-mail: dcaruso@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IF we can land a man on the moon, why can't we ...?'' has been a familiar, fill-in-your-pet-peeve lament about the state of the world since Neil Armstrong's historic giant leap in 1969. It is a question that continues to engage innovators and scholars.
 The question is less plaintive and more pragmatic for Daniel Sarewitz, director of the Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes at Arizona State University.
 ''Why can we -- people or society -- do some of the things that we set out to accomplish, and not others?'' asked Professor Sarewitz, who examines the relationship between scientific research and public benefit. Recently he has been studying effectiveness in human action, working with Richard R. Nelson, an emeritus professor at Columbia University and a pioneer in evolutionary economics and the economics of innovation. 
 ''Many years ago, I got interested in what people were then calling 'the moon and the ghetto' problem,'' said Professor Nelson, who published a book by that name in 1977. ''This was the commentary in the late 1960s: 'If you can land a man on the moon, why can't you solve the social problems of the ghetto?' ''
 In work funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the professors theorize that the answer to this question may lie within the deceptively simple concept of human know-how.
 Know-how is more than knowledge. It puts knowledge to work in the real world. It is how scientific discoveries become routine medical treatments, and how inventions -- like the iPod or the Internet -- become the products and services that change how we work and play.
 As the moon-and-ghetto disparity demonstrates, know-how is unevenly distributed. But why? To find out, the professors looked for a real-world comparison that would not carry too much of a political or emotional charge. In a yet-unpublished essay, they contrast the know-how behind vaccinating children for measles and the know-how behind teaching first graders to read. 
 In the 17th century, they note that reading know-how was such a known quantity that the colony of Massachusetts had a law requiring it to be taught in the home. But a century later, when Cotton Mather championed a new and effective smallpox inoculation in Boston, most of the physicians in town rejected the treatment because it was not supported by the accepted know-how of the time.
 Today the situation is reversed. ''While almost every child vaccinated against measles is safe from the disease,'' the professors write, ''an alarming number of children who are 'taught' to read in school never really learn to read at a level necessary to perform well in today's society.'' 
 One criticism of their approach is that these two examples are not comparable -- that the effectiveness of teaching a child to read is contingent on a variety of factors, from nutrition to peer-group reinforcement to adequate school funding, while the effectiveness of a vaccine is virtually automatic. 
 But ''that's precisely the point,'' Professor Sarewitz said. ''We want to compare the state of know-how, not knowledge.'' In that case, today's know-how on vaccination is far more robust than that on teaching a child to read.
 When know-how is robust, it has a quality that the two men have called the ''go'' -- or a core of reliable action. In their theory, any technology, object or practice that can be reliably standardized and improved over time, like vaccines or software or automobile emissions, has a ''go.'' 
 The relationship between a strong, technology-enabled ''go'' like a vaccine and the problem it solves may seem obvious -- even redundant. After all, at its core, technology is about know-how -- about the tools we develop to help us act and think better.
 But the ''go'' enables more than just the right tool for the job. It can provide a vital convergence point for stakeholders with very diverse agendas. Once they find common cause in a reliable technological solution, they have something to rally around so that all their interests can be advanced.
 ''Reading creates conflict because there's such variability in the predictability of results,'' Professor Sarewitz said. ''But think about the networks of people that have to cooperate in order for vaccines to work in society, and how incredibly different their agendas and worldviews are. They are no more or less diverse than the people who are in a state of pitched battle around reading.''
 As another example, he cites the passage of the Montreal Protocol in the late 1980s. Meant to phase out production of chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons that were believed responsible for ozone depletion, it is considered one of the most successful international agreements ever.
 At the time, the chemicals were used widely as refrigerants and solvents for semiconductors. But no one ended up going without refrigerators or computers.
 ''Companies came up with substitutes,'' Professor Sarewitz said. ''And when they did, interests that were previously completely at each other's throats -- chemical companies resistant to regulation, environmentalists, leaders of developing countries, diplomats -- they all converged around the alternative.''
 So how might a better understanding of robust human know-how help us think more strategically about problems like reading, improving health care or reversing climate change? Can the ''go'' teach us something about those problems where there is ''no go?'' After all, the fact remains that ''it's really hard to make progress where you don't have a 'go' or a technology'' to solve the problem at hand, Professor Sarewitz said. 
 THE professors stress that their work is still in progress. But they hope that their work may reframe how we think about our ''no go'' problems and help us find new ways to deploy human know-how and effectiveness beyond the comparatively low-hanging fruit that technological solutions provide. This ability would signal an important change in how societies approach and address their most pressing issues. 
 ''One of the things we need to get away from is the notion that science and technology know-how is a general-purpose magic bullet that will solve all problems,'' Professor Nelson said. 
 If they can study enough examples of effective human know-how, they might be able to identify new ways to make progress when no technological fix exists. ''We're looking for a 'go' where there might not be an obvious one,'' Professor Sarewitz said.
 Whether or not the search yields results, it will at least help us to better understand why we can put a man on the moon, but we cannot manage to improve literacy rates, or shape workable policies on climate change, or reduce global poverty.
 Knowing the mechanics that drive the ''go'' may help us to separate what is practically effective from our value judgments, and come up with a process that spurs solutions to problems as predictably as technological know-how does today.

HEADLINE: Edison the Inventor, Edison the Showman

BYLINE: By RANDALL STROSS

 BODY:
This article was adapted from ''The Wizard of Menlo Park: How Thomas Alva Edison Invented the Modern World,'' by Randall Stross, a contributor to The New York Times. The book, to be published on Tuesday by Crown Publishers, examines the reality and the myths surrounding the Edison legacy.
 THOMAS ALVA EDISON is the patron saint of electric light, electric power and music-on-demand, the grandfather of the Wired World, great-grandfather of iPod Nation. He was the person who flipped the switch. Before Edison, darkness. After Edison, media-saturated modernity.
Well, not exactly. The heroic biography we were fed as schoolchildren does have its limitations, beginning with the omission of other inventors who played critical roles -- not just Edison's gifted assistants, but also his accomplished competitors. What's most interesting about the standard Edison biography that we grew up with is not that it is heroic but that it is outsized, a projected image quite distinct from the man who stood 5-foot-9. 
 Edison is famously associated with the beginnings of movies, which is where the modern business of celebrity begins. But he deserves to be credited with another, no less important, discovery related to celebrity that he made early in his own public life, accidentally: the application of celebrity to business. 
 No one of the time would have predicted that it would be an inventor, of all occupations, who would become the cynosure of the age. In retrospect, fame may appear to be a justly earned reward for the inventor of practical electric light in 1879 -- yet Edison's fame came before light. It was conferred two years earlier, for the invention of the phonograph. Who would have guessed that the announcement of the phonograph's invention was sufficient to propel him in a matter of a few days from obscurity into the firmament above?
 After ''Edison'' became a household name, he would pretend that nothing had changed, that he was as indifferent as ever. But this stance is unconvincing. He did care, at least most of the time. When he tried to burnish his public image with exaggerated claims of progress in his laboratory, for example, he demonstrated a hunger for credit unknown in his earliest tinkering. The mature Edison, post-fame, is most appealing whenever he returned to acting spontaneously, without weighing what action would serve to enhance his public image.
 One occasion when Edison cast off the expectations of others in his middle age was when he met Henry Stanley, of ''Dr. Livingston, I presume'' fame, and Stanley's wife, who had come to visit him at his laboratory in West Orange, N.J. Edison provided a demonstration of the phonograph, which Stanley had never heard before. Stanley asked, in a low voice and slow cadence, ''Mr. Edison, if it were possible for you to hear the voice of any man whose name is known in the history of the world, whose voice would you prefer to hear?''
 ''Napoleon's,'' replied Edison without hesitation.
 ''No, no,'' Stanley said piously, ''I should like to hear the voice of our Savior.''
 ''Well,'' explained Edison, ''You know, I like a hustler.''
 Edison had retained the patent rights and business stakes in the phonograph, so when the business came into its own, he approved the construction of expanded manufacturing facilities adjacent to his laboratory to handle the orders that poured in. This was followed by still more growth, and more building: an entire block adjacent to the laboratory was filled with five-story hulks. By 1907, as the company erected its 16th building, Edison boasted of ''the largest talking machine factory in the world.'' 
 Edison and his copywriters courted the urban middle class with advertising that made prospective customers feel as entitled to enjoy the pleasures of recorded music as anyone. ''When the king of England wants to see a show, they bring the show to the castle and he hears it alone in his private theater.'' So said an advertisement in 1906 for the Edison phonograph. It continued: ''If you are a king, why don't you exercise your kingly privilege and have a show of your own in your own house.''
 Other advertisements developed the theme of the phonograph as the great leveler. In 1908, a man in formal wear and his slender wife stood on one side of a table, upon which sat a phonograph; on the other side stood four servants, wearing smiles and expressions of curiosity. The caption said the Edison phonograph had brought the same entertainment enjoyed by the rich within the range of all. The credit for making the phonograph ''the great popular entertainer'' was to be bestowed upon Thomas Edison. ''He made it desirable by making it good; he made it popular by making it inexpensive.'' Another advertisement promised that the phonograph would ''amuse the most unresponsive,'' adding reverently, ''It is irresistible because Edison made it.''
 IN truth, the Edison phonograph fell short of being irresistible; nor did it lead the industry in technical innovation. It was the Victor Talking Machine Company that made discs a practical medium. The disc's flat dimensions offered a more convenient means of storing many songs than the three-dimensional Edison cylinder. It was Victor that came up with a disc that offered four minutes of capacity when Edison's cylinder's had only two minutes. And it was Victor that introduced the Victrola, which hid the horn of the phonograph within a wood cabinet, transforming it into a piece of fine furniture -- and a very profitable item for its manufacturer.
 Edison's offerings may have lagged, but such was the demand for kingly entertainment enjoyed at home that the Edison Phonograph Works prospered along with Victor and Columbia, the companies that with Edison comprised the dominant three in the industry. Edison's cylinder, which cost about 7 cents to manufacture, sold for 50 cents, providing a nice gross margin that covered all manner of strategic missteps. One of those was Edison's conviction that there was no need to switch to discs. When he finally gave in and brought out discs, he could not bring himself to relinquish cylinders, so resources had to be spread across two incompatible formats. Nor would he permit his standards for sound quality to be compromised. He insisted that his discs be twice the thickness of those produced by the competition and much heavier, which provided for better sound but made them far more cumbersome.
 Edison was adamant that Edison recordings would be played only on Edison phonographs. His competitors, Victor and Columbia, shared the same playback technique, etching a laterally cut groove that sent the needle moving horizontally as the record played. Their recordings could be played on one another's machines. Edison, however, adopted his own design, a groove that varied vertically, called at the time a ''hill and dale'' cut. An adapter permitted Victor records to be played on an Edison Disc Phonograph, but Edison forbade the sale of an attachment that permitted his records to be played on competitors' machines.
 Edison had never shown a talent for strategy, and he did not give the subject close study. He spent most of his time working on problems related to industrial chemistry, principally those related to batteries, and, secondarily, those related to mass production of cylinders and discs. Yet he did take time to make decisions about music, personally approving -- and, more often, disapproving -- the suggestions of underlings about which performers should be recorded. His dislike of various musical genres and artists was strong and encompassed almost everything. Popular music -- ''these miserable dance and ragtime selections'' -- had no chance of receiving his blessing. Jazz was for ''the nuts;'' one performance reminded him of ''the dying moan of dead animals.'' But he was no elitist. He also dismissed the members of the Metropolitan Opera House as lacking tune. Sergei Rachmaninoff was just ''a pounder.''
 In 1911, Edison wrote a correspondent that he had had to take on the responsibilities of musical director for his company because the incumbent had made what Edison deemed to be awful decisions, permitting players to play out of tune and, most egregiously, tolerating a defective flute that ''on high notes gives a piercing abnormal sound like machinery that wants oiling.'' 
 To Edison, the technical problems posed in recording sound by purely mechanical means, prior to the development of the microphone, were far more absorbing than business issues. He allocated his time accordingly. He spent a year and a half overseeing research on how to record and clearly reproduce the word ''sugar'' perfectly. Two more months were needed to master ''scissors.'' He wrote, ''After that the phonograph would record and reproduce anything.'' This was not wholly true. Recording an orchestra with pre-electric acoustic technology presented insoluble problems. He did his best, ordering the construction of the world's largest brass recording horn, 128 feet long, 5 feet in diameter at the end that received sound, tapering down to 5/8 of an inch at the other. Its construction required 30,000 rivets alone, each carefully smoothed on the interior surface. It was a marvel of metalwork, but as an instrument for recording sound, it never worked very well. (It did serve its country well, however, being sent off for service in World War II in a scrap drive.)
 Edison's partial loss of hearing prevented him from listening to music in the same way as those with unimpaired hearing. A little item that appeared in a Schenectady newspaper in 1913 related the story that Edison supposedly told a friend about how he usually listened to recordings by placing one ear directly against the phonograph's cabinet. But if he detected a sound too faint to hear in this fashion, Edison said, ''I bite my teeth in the wood good and hard and then I get it good and strong.'' The story would be confirmed decades later in his daughter Madeleine's recollections of growing up. One day she came into the sitting room in which someone was playing the piano and a guest, Maria Montessori, was in tears, watching Edison listen the only way that he could, teeth biting the piano. ''She thought it was pathetic,'' Madeleine said. ''I guess it was.''
 EDISON, though, was undaunted by the limitations of his hearing, which would make for an inspirational tale, were it not for the fact that he was the self-appointed musical director of a profit-seeking record business, whose artistic decisions directly affected the employees of the Edison Phonograph Works. His judgments and whims met no obstruction. 
 Workers spread word daily about Edison's mood. ''The Old Man is feelin' fine today'' was welcome news. But if the word was ''the Old Man's on the rampage,'' employees dove for cover, ''as in a cyclone cellar, until the tempest was over.''
 Not just his employees but also the general public angered Edison. He was exasperated by a public that clamored, he said, ''for louder and still louder records.'' He believed that ''anyone who really had a musical ear wanted soft music.'' And it was those customers, the ''lovers of good music,'' whom Edison in 1911 said would be ''the only constant and continuous buyers of records.'' This was wishful thinking. What was plainly evident to everyone else was that the only constant in the music business was inconstancy, the fickle nature of popular fads. The half-life of a commercially successful song was brief. By the time Edison's factory shipped the first records three weeks after recording, the flighty public had already moved on. 
 Even then, in the founding years of the recorded-music business, the economics of the industry was based upon hits, the few songs that enjoyed an unpredictably large success and subsidized the losses incurred by the other releases. On rare occasions, Edison grudgingly granted this. Then he would concede that the popular music he disdained was in most demand, and he took what comfort he could in the thought that the ''trash'' his company reluctantly released did help to sell phonographs and indirectly help him to provide ''music of the class that is enjoyed by real lovers of music.'' 
 This business was not so easily mastered, however, and the contempt with which Edison regarded popular music did not help him understand his customers. They would purchase the records of particular performers whom they had heard of but shied away from the unknown artists. Decades later, economists who studied the workings of the entertainment industry would identify the winner-take-all phenomenon that benefited a handful of performers. The famous become more famous, and the more famous, the richer. Everyone else faces starvation. This was the case at the turn of the 20th century, too. 
 The management of the Victor Talking Machine Company understood these basic market principles long before Edison absorbed them. Shortly after the company's founding in 1901, Victor signed Enrico Caruso to an exclusive contract, paying him a royalty that was rumored to be 25 percent of the $2 retail price of a Caruso record. His estimated annual earnings from royalties in 1912 was $90,000, at a time when the second most popular singer earned only $25,000. 
 At the same time Victor was writing checks for the leading talents of the day, Edison brought out his checkbook reluctantly and rarely. One exception was when, in 1910, he signed the woman who way back on a wintry night in 1879 had visited his Menlo Park laboratory: Sarah Bernhardt.
 In the Edison Phonograph Monthly, the company's internal trade organ, much was made of the difficulties that had had to be overcome in order to land an artist such as Bernhardt. She had had to be persuaded to discard her ''professional aversion to exploiting her talent in this manner.'' The monetary terms supposedly were not an issue. The sticking point was her concern that crude recording technology would leave posterity with a sound inferior to her voice. According to the company's publicists, a demonstration of the phonograph persuaded her that Edison would produce ''perfect records.'' The company urged dealers to write their local newspapers and reap free publicity: ''No paper will refuse to publish the news, as everything that the immortal Bernhardt does is eagerly seized upon by the press.'' 
 We do not know whether Bernhardt ruled out commercial considerations. (She did endorsements for commercial products like a dentifrice for a fee, but she did draw the line when P. T. Barnum offered her $10,000 for the rights to display a medical curiosity: her amputated leg.) We do know that Edison hated the negotiations with recording stars, which entailed monetary demands far in excess of what Edison considered reasonable. He complained that despite their talk about their love for their art, ''it is money, and money only, that counts.'' Even the large sums paid to the most famous failed to secure their loyalty. He grumbled that artists would bolt ''for a little more money offered by companies whose strongest advertising point is a list of names.'' 
 EDISON convinced himself -- without consulting others, in typical fashion -- that he could simply opt out of competition for stars. He tried a small-budget alternative, scouting undiscovered voices among local choirs in Orange, N.J., and Newark. He wrote a correspondent in 1911, ''I believe if you record church choir singers and musical club, glee club, etc., singers, that we shallbe able to discover a lot of talent just suitable for the phonograph.'' He was pleased to have found locally two tenors who ''can beat any opera tenor except Caruso.'' Over time, Edison did add Anna Case, Sergei (''the Pounder'') Rachmaninoff and a few others. But he permitted competitors to snatch up other performers like Louis Armstrong, Bessie Smith, Fannie Brice and Al Jolson. The first record to sell one million copies was Vernon Dalhart's hillbilly ditty ''The Prisoner's Song.'' Not surprisingly, it was a Victor recording, not an Edison.
 The fame of the performers whom Victor Talking Machines astutely signed did more than bolster record sales; it also added great luster to Victor's brand. A ''Victrola'' soon replaced ''phonograph'' as the generic term, a development that caused Edison considerable distress. 
 Edison dealers grumbled among themselves, too. The Topeka, Kan., agency, for example, complained in early 1915 to the one in Des Moines, ''We have no artists of any note on the Edison.'' It fell to Edison's salespeople to explain their absence on the Edison label. A sales manual from this time laid out the company's defense, which directed the public's attention to ''the great Wizard'' who personally tested voice samples using techniques of his own devising and selected ''those voices which are most worthy of re-creation by his new art.'' Only the voice, not the reputation, mattered to the Wizard.
 So determined was Edison to strip artists of their vanity and unreasonable demands that he refused to print the name of the recording artist on the record label. When his dealer in Topeka asked him to reconsider, Edison let loose a torrent of pent-up opinion:
 ''I am sure you will give me the credit of having put a tremendous amount of thought into the phonograph business after the many years that I have been engaged on it. Not alone to the technical side of the business have I given an immense amount of thought but also to the commercial side, and I want to say to you that I have most excellent reasons for not printing the name of the artist on the record. Your business has probably not brought you into intimate contact with musicians, but mine has. There is a great deal of 'faking' and press agent work in the musical profession, and I feel that for the present at least I would rather quit the business than be a party to the boasting up of undeserved reputations.''
 Edison wrote this in 1913, when he was 66 years old. His confidence in his business acumen had, if anything, grown over time. And in taking this stand, he reveals a nature that could not see the inconsistency: Here his own companies used his fame as the Wizard to market his inventions, prominently displaying his name and driving off anyone who threatened to infringe the trademark. But he could not abide others -- in this case, his own recording artists -- using fame, even though much more modest, for their own commercial interests.

HEADLINE: Major Indexes Gain as Global Markets Rebound

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Global stock markets bounced back last week, and on Wall Street the three major stock indexes posted healthy gains.
 The American stock market is still down for the year, but it cut its losses sharply, helped by unexpectedly strong data on jobs on Friday. The unemployment rate in February fell to 4.5 percent from 4.6 percent the previous month, suggesting a robust level of job creation -- although much of the growth in jobs was confined to the public sector. 
The best weekly performer in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was Big Lots, the discount chain, whose fourth-quarter profit exceeded Wall Street estimates. Its shares gained 19.8 percent.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 162.22 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 12,276.32. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 15.68 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 1,402.85. The Nasdaq composite index rose 19.55 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 2,387.55. The three indexes remained more than 1 percent in negative territory for the year.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.59 percent from 4.50 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Digging for the Roots of American Theater

BYLINE: By DONNA KORNHABER and DAVID KORNHABER

DATELINE: WILLIAMSBURG, Va. 

 BODY:
THE quiet, tree-lined boulevards of this reconstructed colonial town may seem an unusual setting for an international conference on the origins of the American commercial theater. But to the people at the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, the location makes perfect sense. 
 ''This is it,'' exclaimed Jim Bradley, public affairs manager for Colonial Williamsburg, gesturing at the dirt road dotted with tourists and school groups. ''This is where American theater began.'' 
The occasion for the conference -- ''The Williamsburg Playhouse of 1760 and the World of 18th-Century Theater,'' set for Thursday through Saturday -- is the completion of a 10-year excavation of one of the first commercial theaters in America. While not the oldest (that distinction belongs to a playhouse erected in Williamsburg in 1716), the theater was among the most important of the colonial era, and the most popular. Records exist of an incident in 1772, when George Washington -- who frequented the theater, as did Thomas Jefferson -- struggled to get box seats to a play called ''A Word to the Wise'' but had to settle for seats in the pit, even though he had helped to underwrite the playhouse. 
 The decision to focus on the playhouse of 1760 was ''in part practical,'' said Cary Carson, the recently retired vice president for research at the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. Excavations in 1931 and 1947 focused on the 1716 theater, with limited success. But this time extensive documentary evidence allowed the archaeologist Lisa Fischer and her team readily to identify the probable location of the theater on the east side of the Capitol Building, under what had since become a storage shed and an employee parking lot. 
 ''Our archaeological methods have improved greatly,'' Ms. Fischer said. ''We were able to build off of earlier excavations.''
 But the significance of the 1760 theater was also decisive. Constructed by the Scottish actor-manager David Douglass for his traveling London Company of Players, the playhouse was a far more elaborate structure than either of Williamsburg's two earlier theaters. (Most theaters of the era, like this one, remained unnamed and are referred to today by either the date of their opening or the location of their construction.) ''By 1760,'' Mr. Carson explained, ''Williamsburg was a real cultural center, similar to New York City, and the theater reflects that.''
 Initial excavations began in 1996 and consisted of ''digging a series of small holes around the site'' for a period of two years, Ms. Fischer said. Finally, in 1998, remnants of structural foundations were discovered. Full-scale excavation began in 1999, with Ms. Fischer and her associates opening up an area measuring 190 feet by 72 feet, and continued for another three years. In addition to a cable thimble used to secure scenery, Ms. Fischer discovered indicators of both the orchestra pit and the stage itself.
 It would be another two years before all the artifacts were cleaned, inventoried and studied. In 2003 the foundation's curator of architecture, William Graham, and its senior architectural historian, Carl Lounsbury, embarked on Phase 2 of the project: the archival research and architectural fieldwork that would help fill in the gaps for reconstruction. They began by meeting with scholars of the 18th-century American stage, traveling as far afield as South Africa and the Czech Republic to visit archives and studying more than a dozen 18th-century playhouses scattered across Europe, from England to Sweden. ''Most theater historians don't actually have to build anything,'' Mr. Lounsbury explained. ''Having to actually build it makes a big difference.''
 From this research a clearer picture of the playhouse has emerged. One of Ms. Fischer's most significant findings was a large iron rod, now believed to have been part of a spiked fence near the stage used to keep audiences from rioting. Further archival research revealed no lobby to speak of. And at 270 seats, space was at a premium. ''You had no more than 9 to 10 inches of seat space, compared to 40 inches today,'' Mr. Lounsbury said. ''It would make economy-class airline seats seem luxurious.'' A large shed on the side of the theater is believed to have housed a greenroom and dressing rooms for the actors.
 According to the documentary evidence an evening at the Williamsburg theater would have been a long one, including a drama or tragedy, a comedy and several entr'actes. English plays would have constituted most of the material, although the Douglass company is known to have produced the first professional performance of an American-written play, Thomas Godfrey's ''Prince of Parthia,'' in Philadelphia in 1767. 
 Shakespeare was perhaps the most popular dramatist of the age -- ''Richard III,'' ''The Merchant of Venice'' and ''Othello'' are all known to have been staged at the playhouse -- with the later English and Irish playwrights John Gay, George Farquhar and Richard Cumberland also drawing crowds. 
 The Williamsburg theater ''was basically part of the English tradition,'' Mr. Graham explained. ''In its structure and its repertory it could have easily been a theater in England.''
 So perhaps it is no wonder that the playhouse fell into disrepair and was destroyed during the American Revolution. 
 So far the reconstruction of the playhouse has been entirely imaginary. Conference attendees will be able to experience a computer-based ''virtual reconstruction'' of the theater, completed in association with the University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities. ''We designed everything on computer,'' Mr. Graham said, ''down to the nails.''
 But plans for an actual full-scale reconstruction remain on the table, Mr. Carson said, with the major obstacle the $35 million price tag. ''My dream,'' he said, ''is to put together a theater company that would perform archaeologically correct 18th-century plays during the day and modern plays in the evening.''
 If this happens, the Williamsburg Playhouse will become the oldest functioning theater built on its original foundations in America, and one of only a handful of functioning 18th-century theaters around the world. But Mr. Carson puts the importance of this project in other terms. 
 ''The Williamsburg Playhouse,'' he said, ''was the gateway to some of the most exciting ideas to enter the colony. Williamsburg is incomplete without a theater.''

HEADLINE: Suddenly, Those Treasury Bonds Don't Look So Bland

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
INVESTORS lulled into thinking that they didn't need ''boring'' Treasury bonds in their portfolios may have just had a rude awakening.
 Over the last two weeks, on days when stocks dropped on exchanges worldwide, many bonds issued by the shakiest creditors fell along with them. Investors who had put their entire fixed-income portfolios into emerging-market debt or high-yield bonds, which are also called junk bonds, learned the hard way that these assets don't necessarily cushion an erratic stock portfolio.
On the other hand, Treasury issues rose in price when stocks fell, which isn't surprising. Treasuries have outperformed stocks in every sustained stock market decline of the last 20 years.
 Treasuries certainly soared during the long stock market swoon that ended in 2003. When stocks bottomed out in March that year, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 47.58 percent from its peak three years earlier. Treasuries, meanwhile, returned 34.11 percent, including interest payments, according to Merrill Lynch. 
 But there is no guarantee that Treasuries will skyrocket in price again if the stock market falls in coming months. Martin J. Mauro, Merrill's fixed-income strategist, said the sharp rise in Treasuries that ended in 2003 was largely a product of aggressive rate-cutting by the Federal Reserve, as well as the sheer length of that stock market decline. Generally, Mr. Mauro said, bonds' response to a stock sell-off depends on why stocks were weak in the first place.
 ''An inflationary environment would be bad for both stocks and bonds,'' he said. ''But this time around, investors are worried about corporate profits and the health of the economy. And that's when lower-quality bonds behave more like stocks.'' He said, however, that higher-quality bonds -- like Treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds -- usually did well in those market conditions.
 In the wave of stock selling that was touched off nearly two weeks ago, when stocks plummeted in Shanghai, Treasury bonds behaved true to form. On Feb. 27, the day the Dow tumbled more than 400 points, Treasury bonds rallied 0.6 percent -- the Treasury market's best day in more than two years. By the end of that week, Treasuries were up 0.9 percent.
 Investors have begun to take note. In the five trading sessions ended on Wednesday, more than $3.6 billion flowed into mutual funds and E.T.F.'s that invest in bonds. That was more than twice the net inflows to bond funds a week earlier, and about 60 percent higher than the average weekly inflows in February, according to AMG Data Services.
 William H. Gross, chief investment officer of the bond fund company Pimco, based in Newport Beach, Calif., said the markets were waking up from a ''Sleepy Hollow'' mentality that had been induced by a relatively long period of low volatility in the riskiest stocks and bonds.
 He listed concerns on which investors have focused in the last two weeks: the sell-off in Chinese equities, weak demand for durable goods, shaky subprime mortgages, a rising Japanese yen, and even the mention of the ''R'' word -- recession -- by Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman.
 ''When all of those come together,'' Mr. Gross said, ''it shakes up the perception that nothing could go wrong.'' 
 He and his team have been ''very bullish'' for some time on investment-grade bonds, he said. He predicted that the Fed would soon start cutting interest rates, which would benefit existing bondholders because bond prices and rates move in opposite directions.
 He said the market was pricing in an interest rate cut of 0.25 percent at the Fed's meeting in June, and a total rate reduction of 0.5 percent by year-end. That would reduce the benchmark federal funds rate to 4.75 percent. But he predicted that the Fed would lower rates as much as 1 percent this year, to 4.25 percent. 
 Jeffrey E. Gundlach, chief investment officer of the TCW Group, a firm in Los Angeles that specializes in fixed-income investing, pointed to the inverted yield curve -- where long-term rates are lower than short-term rates, a reversal of the customary relationship. The phenomenon may mean that the market expects the Fed to lower interest rates because of a weakening economy.
 ''People sounded a lot of alarms when the yield curve first inverted about eight months ago,'' Mr. Gundlach said. But over time, he said, many investors became accustomed to it, ''and you started to hear the old bromide that this time it's different.''
 Mr. Gundlach is a mortgage bond specialist. He manages the TCW Total Return Bond fund, which has had average annual returns of 5.69 percent over the last five years. It is yielding 4.82 percent now. Despite the fund's name, it owns primarily mortgage-backed bonds, and its prospectus guarantees investors that at least 80 percent of the portfolio is always invested in mortgage bonds.
 This bond portfolio has an overall credit rating of triple-A, the highest. Mr. Gundlach says these mortgage bonds are ''a world apart'' from the subprime mortgages that investors have been fretting about lately. The lowest tier of the mortgage bond market ''had been nothing short of a disaster,'' he said, because of a spike in the default rates of subprime loans over the last year. 
 Paul Herbert, a fund analyst at Morningstar, said that while he would not recommend most other mortgage bond funds as core portfolio holdings, he makes an exception for this one. 
 ''You're dealing with a horse of a different color'' compared with most other mortgage bond funds, he said, because the bonds in this portfolio effectively have the same default risk as Treasuries: basically zero.
 In January, Morningstar named Mr. Gundlach as its ''bond fund manager of the year'' for 2006. Mr. Gross has won that honor in two previous years. 
 While a number of institutional investors own Pimco Total Return, a huge bond fund that Mr. Gross manages, Mr. Herbert said he would recommend the Harbor Bond fund, which Mr. Gross also manages, to individual investors. Harbor Bond is similar to Pimco Total Return, Mr. Herbert said, but is offered at a lower cost to individual investors and has no sales charge.
 Some other bond funds that Morningstar recommends as core holdings include Dodge & Cox Income, FPA New Income and Metropolitan West Total Return Bond. Mr. Herbert also said that investors who did not own bonds might start with the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index fund, to gain broad bond market exposure in one portfolio.
 FINALLY, he said that investors who prefer exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.'s, could choose among the iShares bond funds from Barclays. These are sliced and diced according to the duration of the bonds; for example, the shortest is the iShares Lehman 1-3 Year Treasury Bond fund. Mr. Herbert said he expected more bond E.T.F.s to be introduced soon.
 He explained that when Morningstar analysts chose their favorite bond funds, they paid particular attention to details like risk management, research capabilities and, especially, expenses. Compared with returns of stock funds, he said, ''there is a much smaller range of returns in the bond fund universe,'' so investors should be particularly careful to avoid high fees.

HEADLINE: History, Digitized (and Abridged)

BYLINE: By KATIE HAFNER

DATELINE: SALINAS, Calif. 

 BODY:
THE National Steinbeck Center, at the top of Main Street in this farming community, exhibits an array of artifacts from John Steinbeck's life and works: family memorabilia, a passport from the 1960s and movie stills from ''The Grapes of Wrath.'' Downstairs, in a climate-controlled vault, is the original manuscript of ''The Pearl,'' his novella published in 1947. There is also an exuberant letter that Steinbeck wrote to a distant relative when he was a teenager, as well as rare footage of him on 16-millimeter film, introducing a 1961 movie, ''Flight.''
 Steinbeck aficionados wishing to examine the manuscript of ''The Pearl,'' which he wrote in pencil in small, precise handwriting on a yellow legal pad, have to travel here -- after making an appointment with a part-time archivist, who is in on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. 
The center takes great care to preserve these relics of Steinbeck, a Nobel laureate, yet it has no plans to take the collection a step further, to adapt to a digital age. As a result, the manuscript of ''The Pearl'' is no more likely to be digitized than is the camper with the canine-motif curtains that Steinbeck immortalized in his book ''Travels With Charley,'' and that is parked in perpetuity in the center's main exhibition hall.
 These Steinbeck artifacts are not the only important pieces of history that are at risk of disappearing or being ignored in the digital age. As more museums and archives become digital domains, and as electronic resources become the main tool for gathering information, items left behind in nondigital form, scholars and archivists say, are in danger of disappearing from the collective cultural memory, potentially leaving our historical fabric riddled with holes. 
 ''There's an illusion being created that all the world's knowledge is on the Web, but we haven't begun to glimpse what is out there in local archives and libraries,'' said Edward L. Ayers, a historian and dean of the college and graduate school of arts and sciences at the University of Virginia. ''Material that is not digitized risks being neglected as it would not have been in the past, virtually lost to the great majority of potential users.''
 To be sure, digitization efforts over the last 10 years have been ambitious and far-reaching. For many institutions, putting collections online, for both preservation and accessibility, is a priority. Yet for every letter from Abraham Lincoln to William Seward that can be found online, millions of documents bearing fine-grained witness to the Civil War will never be digitized. And for every CD re-release of Bessie Smith singing ''Gimme a Pigfoot,'' the work of hundreds of lesser-known musicians from the early 20th century are unlikely to be converted to digital form. Money, technology and copyright complications are huge impediments.
 It is not for a lack of trying. 
 At the Library of Congress, for example, despite continuing and ambitious digitization efforts, perhaps only 10 percent of the 132 million objects held will be digitized in the foreseeable future. For one thing, costs are prohibitive. Scanning alone on smaller items ranges from $6 to $9 for a 35-millimeter slide, to $7 to $11 a page for presidential papers, to $12 to $25 for poster-size pieces. (The cost of scanning an object can be a relatively minor part of the entire expense of digitizing and making an item accessible online.)
 Similarly, at the National Archives, the repository for some nine billion documents, only a small fraction are likely to be digitized and put online. And at thousands of smaller, local collections around the country, the bulk of the material is languishing on yesterday's media: paper, LPs, magnetic tape and film. 
 Strapped for money, archivists around the country are looking to private partners for help. Google has donated $3 million to help start an effort led by the Library of Congress that will digitize and share materials around the globe, and has also provided technical resources for digitizing various printed materials at the library. Google, on its own, is digitizing books at the Library of Congress, which has its hands full with other items. And a number of other companies and foundations, including Reuters, I.B.M. and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, have financed digitization projects around the world.
 Even with outside help, experts say, entire swaths of political and cultural history are in danger of being forgotten by new generations of amateur researchers and serious scholars.
 Consider the Library of Congress archive of one million photo prints from The New York World-Telegram & Sun; only 5,407 have been digitized. Of the 1.2 million images from U.S. News and World Report, the library has digitized only 366. Its collection of five million images from Look magazine, spanning the period from 1937 to 1971, creates what Jeremy E. Adamson, director of collections and services at the library, calls ''a fascinating portrait of America through photo stories on social and political subjects, personalities, food, fashion and sports.'' Yet only 313 of those images have been digitized.
 ''It's a crying shame,'' Mr. Adamson said, ''as today's public is acutely visually literate and comfortable with pictures as a means to understand the past and experience for themselves the direct look and feel of history.'' 
 The reason for not digitizing these collections? ''Not enough money,'' Mr. Adamson said.
 THE decision to put off digitizing a significant collection is seldom easy, archivists at the Library of Congress say. Plans to digitize The National Intelligencer, a newspaper published in Washington during much of the 19th century and filled with Colonial script not easily recognized by digitizing equipment, eventually had to be put on hold because of the high expense.
 ''If researchers conclude that the only valuable records they need are those that are online they will be missing major parts of the story,'' said James J. Hastings, director of access programs at the National Archives. ''And in some cases they will miss the story altogether.'' 
 Maritime buffs, for example, hoping to use the Internet to piece together the story of the Silenus, one of the finest ships ever built in North America, will find a spotty narrative. The papers of its captain, Joseph King, who lived a brief but adventurous life, from 1782 to 1806, can be found courtesy of the Mellon Foundation, in a digitized archive from the Mystic Seaport's collection. Researchers will see how much Captain King paid for ''1 potte lijn oli'' in 1803, when the ship was in the Netherlands. 
 What they will not see is that two years after Captain King's death, at the Cape of Good Hope, the ship itself was advertised for sale on May 4, 1808, in Calcutta. This clue remains paperbound, on the front page of The Asiatic Mirror, an English-language newspaper published in Calcutta during that era, whose only known remaining copies now reside in large bound volumes in a remote storage room outside Washington. The relative obscurity of the newspaper, and its odd size, make it impractical to digitize.
 A Google search will pick up the next chapter of the story at the Princeton University's special collection, which includes the papers of James and Dolley Madison. It reveals that in 1817, President Madison signed over the ship's papers to William Gallup. 
 ''The story of what happened to the good ship Silenus between 1806 and 1817 will never be complete,'' said Mr. Adamson of the Library of Congress, ''but what happened in 1808 in Calcutta is the kind of little crumb that can be picked up and become a significant research item.''
 The ultimate fate of information relating to potentially valuable but obscure people, places, events or things like the Silenus highlights one of the paradoxes of the digital era. While the Internet boom has made information more accessible and widespread than ever, that very ubiquity also threatens records and artifacts that do not easily lend themselves to digitization -- because of cost, but also because Web surfers and more devoted data hounds simply find it easier to go online than to travel far and wide to see tangible artifacts. 
 ''This is the great problem right now, and it's a scary thing,'' said the documentary filmmaker Ken Burns. ''The dots are only connected by a few of us who are willing to go to the places to make those connections.''
 In its digitization efforts, the Library of Congress is focusing mainly on special collections, hewing to a philosophy that it should be digitizing objects that cannot be seen elsewhere. There are the obvious things, like the papers of Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln. And then there are the Farm Security Administration's collection of photographs from the Depression, and a set of mounted photographs of the America's Cup yacht race since the 1890s. 
 Elizabeth S. Dulabahn, a senior manager at the Library of Congress who oversees part of the library's digitizing effort, said the library was examining closely the behavior of those who use its Web site. 
 ''We're trying to do a better job of understanding the kinds of information that people are looking for on the Web, and the kinds of searches that bring users to the library's site,'' she said. She cited Women's History Month and the centennial of the first Wright Brothers flight as ''examples of events of interest to a broad constituency.'' 
 The Library of Congress and other archives are creating indexes that refer to the contents of a physical collection, in the hope that they will entice researchers away from their computers. 
 But the reality remains that a new generation of researchers prefers to seek information online, a trend made all too clear to Mr. Hastings of the National Archives last year, after Google, in an experiment of sorts, digitized 101 of the National Archives' films -- including World War II newsreels and NASA footage -- and put them up on its site, at video.google.com/nara.html.
 ''Before that happened, we had 200 requests total for the whole year in our research room,'' Mr. Hastings said. ''The first month the films were available on Google, there were about 200,000 hits on them -- a thousandfold increase.'' 
 In some cases, strange bedfellows have conspired to help solve the problem.
 Over the years, the New Orleans Public Library has steadily been digitizing its photographs, but its documents have gone largely untouched. The collection, which rivals the holdings of many university special collections, contains millions of historical documents, going back to 1769 and the Spanish colonial era. 
 The records survived Hurricane Katrina unscathed, but are still at risk for damage and loss, said Irene Wainwright, an archivist at the library.
 ''I can't tell you how many people have suggested to us, 'Oh, you just need to digitize all that stuff down in the basement and you'll be all right,' '' Ms. Wainwright said. ''They have no idea how much effort that requires.'' 
 Enter the Genealogical Society of Utah, an organization financed by the Mormon Church, for whom the search for ancestors is a core mission. The society has embarked on a three-year, $200,000 project to digitize all of the library's genealogically relevant records from 1805 to 1880 (www.familysearch.org).
 ''The records we gather document the lives of people,'' said Wayne J. Metcalfe, vice president of the society. ''Births, christenings, land records and other documents that provide information about individuals who have lived on the earth.'' 
 To that end, genealogy experts affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are fanning out, digital cameras in hand, making copies of genealogically relevant records in 200 cities around the world, including New Orleans. Over the next five years, the church expects to have hundreds of millions of digital images available. 
 Mr. Metcalfe said economies of scale helped his organization bring down the cost of capturing each image to roughly 20 cents -- far less than what a commercial company might charge. 
 Similarly, I.B.M.'s digitization efforts -- dating to the mid-1990s, when the company converted a healthy chunk of the Vatican Library's archives -- are done in a way to benefit the company as well as the institution looking to digitize its holdings. 
 ''We look for projects that will highlight I.B.M.'s most innovative technologies or help us develop those technologies with very specific partners who have a problem to solve,'' said Paula Baker, vice president for global community initiatives at I.B.M. The company looks for projects that require the newest technology. 
 Such is the case with its most recent multiyear, multimillion-dollar project: a virtual version of the vast Forbidden City in Beijing, which I.B.M. is building in partnership with China's Ministry of Culture. When it is finished, early next year, the site will include interactive, three-dimensional images of ancient thrones, artwork and military implements. 
 Ms. Baker added that each time I.B.M. embarks on a new venture, requests start coming in from other institutions in need. ''When we do these projects everyone else comes out of the woodwork,'' she said. ''But we have to be very selective.''
 Donald J. Waters, program officer for scholarly communication at the Mellon Foundation, said his foundation had also become increasingly selective over the years.
 By way of example, Dr. Waters pointed to the papers of Matthew Parker, the archbishop of Canterbury in the 16th century who collected ancient manuscripts to prove the early existence of an independent English-speaking church that was responsible not to the pope but to the king of England. For centuries, those papers have been locked up at Corpus Christi College at Cambridge University. Mellon is financing a project to put them online.
 ''It takes a special skill to select stand-alone collections that have a durable appeal in the marketplace of scholars, which is the marketplace that Mellon cares most about,'' Dr. Waters said. ''As interesting and as important as standout collections in individual libraries and archives might be, the mere fact of digitizing them does not mean that once they are online they will attract and sustain an audience.''
 The Parker collection, Dr. Waters said, meets all these criteria -- it is a core collection for a variety of fields: linguistics, ecclesiastical and religious history, English history, art history, medieval studies. He added, however, that the materials have a long history of restricted access, largely to protect the materials because they are so important.
 ''Digitization would allow much broader access to the contents,'' he said, ''which is sufficient for much research, without exposing the physical manuscripts to added handling.''
 WHILE copyright is not a concern for those digitizing documents that are hundreds of years old, copyright restrictions play a significant role when it comes to modern material. Even if the Steinbeck Center in Salinas were to find the money to digitize, say, the manuscript of ''The Pearl,'' its copyright would limit its distribution. 
 ''At this point, online materials are best for authors no longer under copyright,'' said Susan Shillinglaw, a professor of English at San Jose State University and scholar in residence at the Steinbeck Center.
 When Leonard Bernstein's family donated the composer's papers to the Library of Congress in 1993, it was with the goal of digitizing portions of the collection and making them broadly accessible. Although more than a thousand items from the collection have been digitized and placed on the library's Web site, there is still an enormous quantity of material that, because of sheer volume and copyright concerns, is still accessible only to researchers who travel to the library.
 For instance, the collection includes a seven-page letter that Jacqueline Kennedy wrote by hand to Bernstein at 4 a.m. on June 8, 1968, the day after the funeral for Robert F. Kennedy, thanking him for conducting Mahler's Requiem during the ceremony. The letter is an extraordinary window into her grief: ''Your music was everything in my heart, of peace and pain and such drowning beauty,'' she wrote. But the library would need permission from the estate of Mrs. Onassis to digitize it.
 When it comes to sound recordings, copyright law can introduce additional complications. Recordings made before 1972 are protected under state rather than federal laws, and under a provision of the 1976 Copyright Act, may be entitled to protection under state law until 2067. Also, an additional copyright restriction often applies to the underlying musical composition.
 A study published in 2005 by the Library of Congress and the Council on Library and Information Resources found that some 84 percent of historical sound recordings spanning jazz, blues, gospel, country and classical music in the United States, and made from 1890 to 1964, have become virtually inaccessible. 
 ''Copyright is a very blunt instrument,'' said Tim Brooks, the author of ''Lost Sounds: Blacks and the Birth of the Recording Industry, 1890 to 1919'' (University of Illinois, 2004). ''Once you have copyright, you have total control; there's very little room in the copyright law even for preservation, much less reissuing material.'' 
 Generally, rights owners like Sony BMG have reissued on CD only a small portion of the recordings they control.
 For example, John Philip Sousa's own band made scores of recordings for Victor Records in the early 20th century. BMG bought Victor in 1986, and few if any of those recordings have since been reissued on CD. ''There is probably an odd track out somewhere,'' Mr. Brooks said, ''but they've certainly never done any kind of retrospective of him that I'm aware of.'' And of the hundreds of recordings made in the same period by Noble Sissle, an African-American tenor who recorded for several labels now owned by Sony BMG, few if any have made it onto CD.
 THE result, Mr. Brooks said, is a series of gaps in the popular understanding of the nation's musical heritage. ''It's as if before Bessie Smith, there was nothing,'' he said. ''It has the effect of narrowing our own understanding of our own history.'' 
 Another factor that determines what is digitized is how straightforward it is to copy the material. 
 In some cases, said Theresa Salazar, curator of Western Americana at the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley, the two go hand in hand. ''Agencies and organizations providing funding often want large volume for their money,'' Ms. Salazar said. 
 For example, she pointed out, objects like books can be handled in a straightforward way. It is easy to capture these materials because they are printed, and many of these titles are more or less the same size.
 No one knows this better than Google, whose digitization efforts focus mainly on books. 
 In its quest to scan every one of the tens of millions of books ever published, Google has already digitized one million volumes. Google refuses to say how much it has spent on the venture so far, but outside experts estimate the figure at at least $5 million. The company has also been scanning and indexing academic journals to make them searchable, and is working with the Patent Office to digitize thousands of patents dating back to 1790.
 David Eun, Google's vice president for content partnerships, said that rather than dwell on what is being left behind, he preferred to take a more optimistic view. 
 ''We're talking about a huge, huge universe of content,'' Mr. Eun said. ''If you look at the glass as half-empty it becomes too overwhelming.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 18, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the digitization of historical documents referred incorrectly to a 1968 letter from Jacqueline Kennedy to Leonard Bernstein, part of a Bernstein collection that was donated to the Library of Congress. The letter, which thanked Bernstein for conducting a Gustav Mahler work at the funeral of Robert F. Kennedy, was referring to the Adagietto movement from Mahler's Fifth Symphony; Mrs. Kennedy did not thank him in the letter for conducting ''Mahler's Requiem.'' (Mahler never composed a requiem.)

HEADLINE: Going Where Mother Led

BYLINE: By LESLIE V. NORWALK; As told to Eve Tahmincioglu.

 BODY:
I COME from a family of very strong women. My mother's mother, Nana, was a strong individual and had lots of opinions and made them known. And my mother likewise. She brought in a lot of money for the family as a real estate broker, and she had an enormous personality.
 My mother was the president of the Junior League, sometime in the late 1960s. She was doing a fund-raiser for a Christmas event in Dayton. She wanted to get a C.E.O. from a company in town to give money and set out to get his attention. 
 She was very pregnant with my little sister at the time. She showed up at his office and told his secretary that she really needed to talk to him. After being refused, she said she was willing to lie in front of his door until she saw him. She did get to see him, and the C.E.O. contributed to the event.
 For my mom, at the end of the day, it was all about ''what is it you need to do in order to accomplish your goals.''
 In college, I majored in economics. I wanted to be an investment banker or an arms dealer. I decided in the end to try my luck on Wall Street. The market crashed in 1987, the year before I graduated. I remember I broke my leg during my senior year and I ended up hobbling around New York City interviewing with about seven or eight big investment banks.
 I didn't get one offer. But I still remember the best interview question one of the interviewers asked me: ''Do you consider yourself a leader or a team player?'' I remember thinking long and hard and ultimately saying team player. But now I would say leader. 
 Since I didn't get any offers, I moved down to Washington. My uncle has a historical consulting firm there, and he had an extra room in his house and I worked for him. While there, I decided I wanted to get involved in politics and worked on George H. W. Bush's campaign in 1988. 
 After he won the election, I ended up helping the team briefing Louis Sullivan, the former secretary of health and human services, for his confirmation hearing. I was around 22 at the time. 
 One woman I had worked for ended up going to the White House, and she said to me, ''Are you interested in working at the White House?'' I said, ''Yeah!'' 
 I worked in the office of presidential personnel for three women, and between them over three years they had five babies, so I ended up with more responsibilities because I filled in during their maternity leaves. 
 When I was at the White House I do remember I got a little bit too big for my britches. I recall I told someone they couldn't have a job before the application had been fully vetted. And I wasn't the final decision on that either. 
 My boss was disappointed in me. I had made a bad judgment and it made me realize you have to have a bit of an ego, or a lot of self-confidence, but you also have to make sure that it doesn't get in the way of your decision-making. 
 You need to listen to the people around you. At the end of the day, you need to get all the input, ask all the right questions, listen to all the advisers. You have to be able to make a decision, but do it with as much input as possible.
 I decided to go to law school at night and get my law degree when I worked for the U.S. trade representative. My mom died while I was there, and that had a pivotal impact on my life. She was my role model, my rock and foundation. I was devastated. I was 26 and that made me grow up much faster. I had already applied to law school, but her death gave me a push. 
 Looking back on it now, it led me to think of how important health care is. My mother died of a heart attack. She was 56. Women die of heart attacks more than anything else. Taking care of yourself and prevention are so critical.
 When you lose someone close to you, in a way you start to focus on what's important -- the big picture, how to get something accomplished and be more efficient. 
 When I lost my mother it gave me confidence to move forward, to be more like my mother and be aggressive in going after what I want.LESLIE V.

HEADLINE: Why Forecast Recessions?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Forecast for the Forecasters Is Dismal'' (Economic View, March 4): 
 The primary problem in economists' forecasting of economic downturns is their choice of ''recession'' -- a period of absolute decline in real gross domestic product -- as the primary measure of economic harm. But by the time the rate of growth in real G.D.P. has fallen, say, from 4 percent to 2 percent, and then to actual declines, growth in businesses' sales and corporate profits, the stock market, and even employment usually has slowed significantly for at least a year, often more.
 The recession represents the end of this period of slowing growth and is thus a lagging economic indicator without much value. Indeed, it takes only a solid slowdown in growth of real G.D.P., not an actual decline, to trigger a bear market, which is why bear markets are more frequent than recessions. 
 Economists need to overcome their ''recession obsession'' and find a new definition for economic malaise based on slowing rates of growth.Joseph H. Ellis Manhattan, March 4The writer is the author of ''Ahead of the Curve: A Commonsense Guide to Forecasting Business and Market Cycles.''

HEADLINE: Fiasco in Brooklyn

 BODY:
The state of politics in the 40th District in Brooklyn is, frankly, a mess. Mathieu Eugene, an unlicensed physician, appeared the winner in a special election last month to fill the City Council seat vacated this year by Yvette Clarke, who had moved on to the House of Representatives. Ms. Clarke and her mother, Una Clarke, who previously held the council seat, enthusiastically backed his campaign. 
 But it turns out that Mr. Eugene, who hoped to become the Council's first elected Haitian-American, had failed to satisfy a basic legal requirement: that he be a resident of the district on election day. This was an unforgivable mistake, reflecting incompetence in either the candidate or his campaign. It also means that the district will have to vote all over again in a second special election.
 Mr. Eugene admits that he did not live in the 40th district during the campaign. But he says the law only required him to establish residency in the district before the date on which the city's Board of Elections certified the results. The Board did so last Thursday. But by then, the state Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo, had shot down Mr. Eugene's convenient reading of the law. Mr. Cuomo ruled that to be declared a winner, a candidate had to be a resident of the district on election day. 
 Mr. Eugene says the law was unclear. But if he believed that, would he not have been wiser to establish residence well in advance instead of leaving everything to the 11th hour, and risking a different reading of the law? Mr. Eugene would do everyone a favor by sitting out the next election. 
 The 40th District -- which includes, among other areas, parts of Flatbush and Crown Heights -- is especially in need of competent representation. It suffers from an elevated school dropout rate, as well as high rates of unemployment and of H.I.V., the AIDS virus. 
 Mr. Eugene's mistake was also costly for taxpayers. Ten candidates campaigned for the office in frigid weather, including others who were not residents. Many voters dug into their meager personal budgets to contribute to the various campaigns. More than $300,000 in public matching funds was awarded to several candidates as part of the campaign finance program. The city's Board of Elections spent another $350,000 to print ballots, put machines in place and provide information to voters. More money will now be required for a do-over, the first anyone can remember in this city. It should be the last. 
 The only real value in this fiasco is that it exposes the weaknesses in the residency law and the need to make common-sense changes in that law to require more accountability from candidates. At a minimum, candidates should be required to live in their district before they even begin their campaign to represent it. Such a reform would produce candidates more committed to serve their neighbors, and discourage opportunistic outsiders.

HEADLINE: Don't Cripple Eminent Domain

 BODY:
New Jersey is so built up that long-term economic growth will depend on the revitalization of its cities with new industry, housing and stores. But significant redevelopment is unlikely to occur if the current campaign to demonize eminent domain and restrict its uses is allowed to succeed. 
 Joseph Maraziti Jr., a prominent land use lawyer and a driving force behind the effort to steer developers to the cities, argued at a conference in Trenton last month that eminent domain is an essential tool if urban land is to be cleared for redevelopment and that without it a handful of holdout property owners could block almost any redevelopment project. If that were to happen, he suggested, New Jersey's economy would eventually suffocate since the state -- already the most densely populated in the country -- is running out of open land.
The New Jersey Legislature is nearing final approval of a measure that would tighten the standards for eminent domain and increase significantly what cities and towns would have to pay unwilling sellers. Approved by the Assembly but stalled in the State Senate, the bill arises in part from the negative reaction to a 2005 United States Supreme Court decision in a Connecticut case that upheld the use of eminent domain for private development, even if the land is not blighted. It also stems, however, from a well-founded reaction against politicians in a few New Jersey towns who have invoked the threat of eminent domain to pressure owners of viable small businesses to sell to favored developers. 
 Redevelopment advocates agree that legislation is needed to stop heavy-handed tactics and to make compensation reflect today's prices. But they also fear that by providing incentives for property owners to hold out for exorbitant prices, the bill would make it difficult, if not prohibitively expensive, for cities to invoke eminent domain. 
 The sponsor, Assemblyman John Burzichelli, a Gloucester Democrat, says this is not his intention and that he only wants to insure that residents and owners are paid fair prices and are given adequate advance notice of plans to take their property, and that only truly blighted areas are condemned. 
 But one section of the bill is especially troublesome. It would base payments to owners on a combination of fair market value and estimates of the income that the redeveloped property would generate. While that approach might have merit in the case of long-term owners and residents, it would be an outrageously high price to pay slumlords, speculators and owners who leave toxic waste on their property. 
 Mr. Burzichelli says there is no way his bill could constitutionally distinguish between good owners and bad owners. But the state's public advocate, Ronald Chen, who supports Mr. Burzichelli's bill, says the flaw can be ''fixed in a minute. '' If so, the Legislature should fix it. 
 Equally important is that the Senate take whatever time it needs to review this complicated issue. Changes in the law may be required in the interest of fairness, but they should not reward speculators or be so crippling as to jeopardize the future health of New Jersey's cities and its economy.

HEADLINE: Lotto Makes Sense, Even for Losers

BYLINE: By BENEDICT CAREY

 BODY:
AT least poker tables have some atmosphere, a jingle of highball glasses, a hint of 1990s menthol smoke in the armchairs, the sweet musk of nearby cash. The same goes for playing the horses: there are characters, scandals, competition, not to mention real payoffs.
 But who, exactly, wants to stamp their frozen feet waiting in line outside a corner store for an infinitesimal shot at winning the lotto? 
The answer, of course, is millions of Americans, who last week pushed the 12-state Mega Millions total to $390 million, half of which was claimed on Wednesday by Ed Nabors, a Georgia truck driver.
 A 2002 nationwide survey found that lotteries are by far the most popular form of gambling, with some 66 percent of United States adults having played in the previous year, and 13 percent on a weekly basis.
 The question is why. Mega officials put the odds of winning the next big score, $12 million, at 1 in 175,711,536, and anyone with a semester of high school math can see what a fool's bet that is. Generally, experts say, state lotteries return players about 50 cents on the dollar. And there are many people who seem to compound their folly by buying hundreds of tickets at a time.
 Addiction researchers and some economists struggle to explain this behavior, describing it at best as an irrational fever, and at worst a pathological addiction to a regressive, government-run numbers game. 
 But researchers spend little time in corner-store lines. 
 ''The people who denigrate lottery players are like 10-year-olds who are disgusted by the idea of sex: they are numb to its pleasures, so they say it's not rational,'' said Lloyd Cohen, a professor of law at George Mason University and author of an economic analysis, ''Lotteries, Liberty and Legislatures,'' who is himself a gambler and a card counter.
 Dr. Cohen argues that lottery tickets are not an investment but a disposable consumer purchase, which changes the equation radically. Like a throwaway lifestyle magazine, lottery tickets engage transforming fantasies: a wine cellar, a pool, a vision of tropical blues and white sand. The difference is that the ticket can deliver. 
 And as long as the fantasy is possible, even a negligible probability of winning becomes paradoxically reinforcing, Dr. Cohen said. ''One is willing to pay hard cash that it be so real, so objective, that it is actually calculable -- by someone, even if not oneself,'' he said. 
 The mundane simplicity of the lottery only reinforces the attraction. Casino card tables can be intimidating, an opaque world of rules and hard-to-master strategies; ditto for the track.
 Because it is pure luck, the lottery is easy to grasp and allows for plenty of perfectly loopy -- and very enjoyable -- number superstitions. Your birthday digits never won you a dime? Try your marriage date; your favorite psalm verse; the day your bullying father-in-law died. Or, perhaps, reverse the order. In studies, psychologists have found that ticket holders are very reluctant to trade their tickets for others, precisely because they have an illusion of control from having picked magical numbers.
 This sense of power infuses the waiting period with purpose. And the hope of a huge payoff, however remote, is itself a source of pleasure. In brain-imaging studies of drug users, as well as healthy adults placing bets, neuroscientists have found that the prospect of a reward activates the same circuits in the brain that the payoffs themselves do. 
 ''It's not just winning the money but anticipating winning the money that is exciting, and the two experiences are similar neurobiologically,'' said Christine Reilly, executive director of the Institute for Research on Pathological Gambling and Related Disorders, in Medford, Mass.
 People who gorge on lotto tickets, buying 100 at a time even after years of luckless playing, are no less rational than anyone else making big bets. And lottery odds are neutral and fair, after all, not biased toward any social elite. Seeing a Georgia truck driver win proves that in players' minds. 
 Large rewards make most people reckless, whether they're on the winning or losing end. A 2003 University of Vermont study found that lottery players who said they preferred to receive potential winnings in annuity payments -- generally thought to be safer than receiving the money all at once, in a lump sum -- often changed their minds when they actually won. And the higher the jackpot, the more likely people were to prefer a lump-sum payout, the researchers found. (Mr. Nabors chose a lump sum.)
 Likewise, studies of stock traders have found that, when behind late in the day, they are more likely than usual to make risky bets, and take heavier losses, in an attempt to get out of the red. 
 ''The point is that, psychologically, we think of a loss as a loss, big or small,'' said Dr. Dan Ariely, a behavioral economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''And once you're into it, you think: Well, why not take a bigger loss, if there's some chance I can turn it into a gain?'' Similarly, people who feel that the opportunities to succeed in life are narrowing, are more likely to play the lottery, or play more often. 
 Households with regular players spend an average of about 2 percent of their income on the game, studies find. The proportion is higher among very low-income households. 
 But in most cases all the odds and numbers seem to pale next to the simple pleasure of possible transformation. 
 ''I don't know what I'll do if I win,'' one man standing in line told a reporter last week. ''It's too much money to think about.'' 
 Exactly.

HEADLINE: The Vanishing Neoliberal

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
On July 25, 1981, Michael Kinsley published an essay in The New Republic called ''The Shame of the Democrats.'' The Democratic Party, the young Kinsley wrote, is viewed ''with growing indifference.'' It is run ''by lawyer-operators with no commitment to any particular political values.'' It is filled ''with politicians who will do or say anything for a word or a dollar of support.'' It represents ''a dwindling collection of special interest groups whose interests are less and less those of either the general populus or the tired and poor.'' In short, Kinsley wrote, ''the Democratic Party has collapsed not just politically but morally.''
 And so began the era of neoliberalism, a movement which, at least temporarily, remade the Democratic Party, redefined American journalism and didn't really die until now. 
 In the early days, the neoliberals coalesced around two small magazines, The New Republic and The Washington Monthly. They represented, first of all, a change in intellectual tone. While the old liberals could be earnest and self-righteous, the neoliberals were sprightly and lampooning. While the old liberals valued solidarity, the neoliberals loved to argue among themselves, showing off the rhetorical skills many had honed in Harvard dining halls. 
 On policy matters, the neoliberals were liberal but not too liberal. They rejected interest-group politics and were suspicious of brain-dead unions. They tended to be hawkish on foreign policy, positive about capitalism, reformist when it came to the welfare state, and urbane but not militant on feminism and other social issues. 
 The neoliberal movement begat politicians like Paul Tsongas, Al Gore (the 1980s and '90s version) and Bill Clinton. It also set the tone for mainstream American journalism. Today, you can't swing an ax in a major American newsroom without hitting six people who used to work at The New Republic or The Washington Monthly. Influenced by their sensibility, many major news organizations became neoliberal institutions, whether they knew it or not.
 Neoliberals often have an air of perpetual youthfulness about them, but they are now in their 40s, 50s and even their 60s, and a younger generation of bloggers set off a backlash. If you surf the Web these days, for example, you find that a horde of thousands have declared war on the Time magazine columnist Joe Klein.
 Kevin Drum, who is actually older than most bloggers, says the difference is generational. Klein's mind-set, he says, was formed in the 1970s and 1980s, but ''like most lefty bloggers, I only started following politics in a serious way in the late '90s.'' Drum says he's reacting to Ken Starr, the Florida ballot fight, the Bush tax cuts, the K Street Project and the war in Iraq. 
 Drum and his cohort don't want a neoliberal movement that moderates and reforms. They want a Democratic Party that fights. Their tone is much more confrontational. They want to read articles that affirm their anger. They are also further to the left, driven there by Iraq on foreign policy matters and by wage stagnation on economic matters. 
 For the past few years, The New Republic has tried to keep the neoliberal flame alive, under editors like Peter Beinart. But there is no longer a readership for that. The longtime owner, Marty Peretz, has sold his remaining interests and, starting this month, the magazine will go biweekly.
 The new format is partly a response to the Web. The forthcoming issue has a lot of good, long, nonideological reports. (Ryan Lizza has a fascinating piece on Barack Obama's Chicago years.) But it's also a shift leftward. As the new editor, Frank Foer, says, there's a generation gap within the magazine, with young interns further to the left. That's where the future lies. Foer is hiring the Ph.D. neopopulist Thomas Frank to write essays on the presidential campaign. Recent editorials have called for tax increases to finance universal health care. The magazine now habitually calls on Democrats to take bold action on things like the war and global warming, but it's still a little fuzzy on what that bold action should be. 
 Over all, what's happening is this: The left, which has the momentum, is growing more uniform and coming to look more like its old, pre-neoliberal self. The right is growing more fractious. And many of those who were semiaffiliated with one party or another are drifting off to independent-land. (The Economist, their magazine, now has over 500,000 American readers -- more than all the major liberal magazines combined.)
 Neoliberalism had a good, interesting run -- while it lasted.

HEADLINE: The Kings Is Dead! Long Live the Kings!

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY. 
E-mail: streetscapes@nytimes.com

 BODY:
S WONDERFUL -- well, mostly -- with the five Loew's ''wonder theaters,'' built in 1929 and 1930 to establish the chain's primacy in the New York area. The Paradise, in the Bronx, has just come alive as a performance hall, the Loew's Jersey has reopened in the same format, and two others became churches long ago.
 Then, there is the sad, unwonderful case of Loew's Kings in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where Barbra Streisand was once a regular moviegoer. Taken over by New York City in 1978 for back taxes, it has been struggling ever since it shut its doors. Repeated attempts to reopen it -- in any form -- have come to naught. 
It was in the 1920s, after the lower costs of movies took dramatic entertainment to the masses, that the Paramount-Publix chain began planning a series of exceptionally grand theaters in the New York area. Its first, the Brooklyn Paramount, was begun in 1927. 
 Warren G. Harris, a theater historian, says that the Loew's chain, which was very strong in New York, then offered Paramount-Publix a deal: drop your theater-building program in New York, and we will not compete with you in the Chicago area. 
 The deal was done, and Loew's picked up what became the wonder theater project, building five by 1930: the Valencia, in Jamaica, Queens; the Kings, on Flatbush Avenue near Beverly Road; the Jersey, on Journal Square in Jersey City; the Paradise, at 184th Street and the Grand Concourse in the Bronx; and the 175th Street Theater, on Broadway in Upper Manhattan. Each seated 3,000 or more and was designed to look like the kind of place you would live in if you were royalty in some part of the world. 
 They were not identical by any means. The Spanish-style Valencia and Paradise were both designed by John Eberson, with his atmospheric open-sky ceilings. The Kings and the Jersey were designed by Rapp & Rapp in the French style with terra-cotta facades. The 175th Street was done in what Norval White and Elliot Willensky call ''Cambodian neo-Classical'' in their A.I.A. Guide to New York City (Crown, 2000). 
 When the working classes showed up at the opening of the Kings in September 1929, they paid 25 to 60 cents to hear Wesley Eddy and his Kings of Syncopation and David Pesetzki conducting the theater's grand orchestra and to see Delores Del Rio in person, along with her movie ''Evangeline.''
 At that point, going to the movies still meant taking in both stage and screen presentations. Advertisements of the period indicate that the same films played in two or three theaters, while each appears to have had its own stage show. 
 But that fall Architecture and Building magazine observed that Loew's Kings was ''probably the first theater to be designed particularly to meet the needs of the presentation of the talking picture,'' because nearly 3,000 of its 3,690 seats were on the ground floor to avoid the acoustical disruptions caused by big balconies. The magazine called the style ''Italian baroque,'' but modern writers see a French influence in the interior and the terra-cotta facade. 
 The term ''wonder theater'' has escaped exact definition, but the Kings is like most other multi-thousand-seat houses in several ways: it has a colossal grand foyer, perhaps 50 feet high, with heavily gilt classical decoration, as well as carefully designed exits and entrances for crowd management during show changes. The auditorium, too, is loaded with decoration. 
 Stage shows went out in the 1930s, and by the 1960s the old palaces sought new revenue. In 1964, boxing fans at the Kings and the Valencia paid $6.75 each to see a closed-circuit broadcast of the Liston-Clay prizefight, in which Cassius Clay -- soon known as Muhammad Ali -- won the heavyweight title from Sonny Liston in six rounds. 
 In the later 1960s and in the 1970s, the wonder theaters gradually shifted to different uses or shut their doors completely, the Kings in 1977. 
 Last fall, the New York City Economic Development Corporation asked for suggestions from developers on what to do with the Kings. Andrew Brent, a spokesman for the agency, will say only that more than one proposal has been received and that the city will try to move beyond the initial stage of the project later this spring. In its solicitation, the city noted that the building had suffered ''substantial damage and deterioration.'' For instance, the roofs over its retail spaces have collapsed. 
 What distinguished the five wonder theaters from the other Loew's picture palaces was never really clear. Indeed, a 1930 ad in The New York Times included the Loew's Pitkin, also in Brooklyn, as one of its ''Big 5 Wonder Theaters'' although theater-history buffs do not include it on their lists. 
 That the term also had a generic use is suggested by a letter to the editor of The Chicago Tribune in 1928. The writer declared that for a structure ''to be a 'wonder theater,' it must be absolutely hideous.'' Also, in 1923, The Boston Daily Globe carried an item on the B. F. Keith circuit's plans for a series of ''wonder theaters.'' 
 A recent search of half a dozen major papers digitized by ProQuest found the first appearance of the term in a 1918 ad in The Chicago Tribune for the Chicago Theater, still standing on State Street. Perhaps it was there that the term was coined, because the Chicago was operated by Balaban & Katz, and by 1927 the firm was associated with Paramount-Publix, which is now generally credited with the ''wonder theater'' idea.

HEADLINE: Suburbia's Northward Crawl

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: HYDE PARK 

 BODY:
FOR Kelly McCurry and Mark Giordano, who rent an apartment in Brooklyn Heights but wanted to buy a condominium, the search for an affordable home in a New York City borough, in an area they deemed appropriate for raising a family, proved fruitless. 
 They widened the circle from Mr. Giordano's job as an insurance underwriter for Travelers in Manhattan, but they discovered that prices in many sections of Westchester and Fairfield Counties to the north were similarly out of reach. 
Finally, last fall, they came upon River Ridge at Hyde Park, a new town-house development along the Hudson River here that was offering 162 one-, two- and three-bedroom units for $334,900 to $459,900.
 After three test rides on Metro-North's Hudson Line from Poughkeepsie to Grand Central Terminal, which is near Mr. Giordano's office, they were convinced he could live some 75 miles north of the city and still commute daily to the city. 
 The 6:15 a.m. express train out of Poughkeepsie arrives in Midtown at 7:47, and the 6:47 a.m. train gets there at 8:17 -- a commute Mr. Giordano, 28, said he would be willing to make in exchange for living in a two-bedroom, three-level condo with a study and more than 30 acres of open space just outside. The couple expect to move into their new home in the spring after their wedding.
 It was not just a matter of affordability, though. ''Mostly, we were taken by the breathtaking setting,'' said Ms. McCurry, 26, who plans to complete her master's studies in library science this spring at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and then look for a job in Dutchess County.
 She said one attraction was the area's rich history. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's home and the Vanderbilt Mansion, both on the National Register of Historic Places, are there. Hyde Park, which has about 21,000 people, is also the site of the Culinary Institute of America.
 Ethan H. Lazar, president of the Cambridge Development Construction Companies, which developed River Ridge, said he had chosen the Hyde Park site because it was less than 10 minutes by car to the Metro-North station in Poughkeepsie.
 ''I'm focusing development on areas in Dutchess that are near mass transit, as opposed to highways,'' said Mr. Lazar, who runs Cambridge, a 28-year-old family-owned business, with his father, Michael J. Lazar, its founder. The Taconic Parkway, which is roughly 15 minutes away, ''in recent years has become a parking lot,'' he added. 
 At the office of Metro-North in Manhattan, Dan Brucker, a spokesman, described Poughkeepsie as the railroad's fastest-growing station in recent years. Last year, the railroad recorded 1,676 boardings at Poughkeepsie on an average workday, up 41 percent from 1994 and up 173 percent from 1985.
 Similarly Bill Lavery, a regional vice president in Dutchess County for Houlihan Lawrence, the real estate agency marketing the new town houses, said the growth in ridership on the Harlem Line reflected a steady influx of population to the area in the past decade.
 At River Ridge, the three-level residences are available in four different styles, all with private terraces on the ground level, decks and third floors designed as lofts. 
 The smallest unit, with 1,265 square feet, has one bedroom, one and a half baths, a living room with a cathedral ceiling and a study. There is also the option of finishing the basement level, which would add 270 square feet of living space.
 The largest unit has 1,725 square feet, including two bedrooms and an area that can be converted to a third bedroom as well as two and a half baths. Finishing the lower level would add about 500 square feet.
 Amenities include a clubhouse with a fitness center, an outdoor swimming pool, a putting green and a court that can be used for tennis, basketball and in-line skating and ice skating. 
 Cambridge Construction, which is based in Manhattan, has built more than 1,000 units of housing in the greater New York area. Most recently, it completed Deerfield Ponds, a development of 240 single-family homes and town houses in Pawling, also in Dutchess County.
 After I.B.M. in nearby Fishkill downsized in the mid-1990s, Mr. Lavery recalled, house values plummeted as employees left the region, he said, but a new a crop of buyers started moving in, attracted by the relatively low home prices and willing to commute to Manhattan or to Westchester County. 
 ''Then, after the terrorist attacks in 2001,'' he added, ''we saw another surge of commuters. As the price delta between house values in places like Westchester and Dutchess continues to widen, we're seeing even more.'' Mr. Lavery estimated that a condo comparable to one selling for $650,000 in Westchester would go for $300,000 less in Dutchess. ''The migration north,'' he said, ''is being driven by economic realities.''
 Eileen Black, a project manager in Dutchess County for Houlihan Lawrence, said that of those who are looking and considering purchase, more than 17 percent are from Westchester and 7.5 percent are from New York City.
 At the town offices here, Donna Knapp, secretary for the Planning Board, acknowledged an increase in applications for new home construction. But Hyde Park is updating its zoning code, she said, and there is a two-year backlog of applications.
 In addition to those commuting daily to New York City or Westchester, the Hyde Park area is attracting business people like Susan Cara, a commercial real estate broker and investment counselor with clients worldwide.
 ''In a global economy,'' Ms. Cara said, ''I can work from anywhere and use e-mails, faxes and FedEx. And even though I don't need to be in Manhattan full time anymore, I do need a presence there.'' 
 Ms. Cara, who lived on the West Side of Manhattan several years ago, moved to a single-family home in Dutchess but now seeks residences in several places.
 She is selling her free-standing house and buying a town house in River Ridge, where an owners' association is responsible for maintenance. She is looking for an apartment in Manhattan and also plans to own a home in Panama, where much of her business is conducted.

HEADLINE: Holding the Line On New Development

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: Homestead, Fla. 

 BODY:
WHEN John Alger, a farmer, visits his property 30 miles southwest of Miami, he sees endless rows of corn. But his mind is on another kind of line.
 Mr. Alger's 1,260-acre farm is divided by the Urban Development Boundary. In 1983, county officials drew the boundary, a jagged line around Homestead and neighboring cities like Princeton and Florida City. Outside the line, development was limited to one dwelling per five-acre lot; the goal was to keep the land from being built on. Inside the boundary, which hugs Route 1 and Florida's Turnpike, by contrast, construction was encouraged. Someday, as the density increased, there might be public transportation.
The plan was a victory for environmentalists looking to narrow the developable portion of southern Miami-Dade County. But now the future of the line is up for grabs -- in part because of a report ordered up by county commissioners and completed this month at a cost of $4 million. The report, which recommended that the boundary be retained until at least 2025, galvanized opposition to the line, commonly called the U.D.B. 
 ''We're in the middle of a battle,'' Mr. Alger said. 
 On one side are farmers who would like to be able to maximize the value of their land, which means allowing the boundary to shift. Katie Edwards, executive director of the Dade County Farm Bureau, which represents Mr. Alger and other farmers, believes market forces should determine where development occurs in Miami-Dade County. 
 On the other side are environmentalists, who consider the boundary sacrosanct. Miami-Dade is nearly 40 miles wide at Homestead. To the east is Biscayne National Park, which includes much of Biscayne Bay, fed by water that runs above and below Miami-Dade.
 According to Dick Frost, a former superintendent of the park, ''If the open land adjacent to the park gets developed in any significant way, the water quality in Biscayne Bay that is necessary for the seagrass and the marine mammals and the fish and even, to some extent, the coral reef -- all of that is in jeopardy.''
 The western border is Everglades National Park, which is undergoing an $8 billion restoration and is affected by the quality of groundwater outside the park. David Anderson, executive director of Audubon of Florida, said simply, ''Maintaining the U.D.B. is critical to the restoration of the Everglades.''
 But to Mr. Alger, the drawing of the line was ''a giant wealth transfer from those outside the boundary to those inside it.'' 
 ''If you're on the right side of the U.D.B., you've got a lot of wealth,'' Mr. Alger said. 
 These days, land outside the boundary is worth about $60,000 an acre, depending on soil and topography, said Rick Swentek, a veteran real estate broker in the area. Inside the line, it is worth significantly more. Mr. Alger and his family are offering one 30-acre plot, where they now grow corn, for just under $800,000 an acre, or around $24 million for the entire parcel.
 Mr. Alger said it made sense to sell some of his land, as development around it makes farming impractical. In the last two years, a Home Depot has gone up on one side of the 30-acre plot, and a BJ's Wholesale Club has gone up on the other.
 As a result, he said, ''We have to come out here and spray at 7 o'clock in the morning because if there's an easterly wind and if any of it blows over to that parking lot and someone gets a headache, I'll be sued.''
 According to the most recent agricultural census, in 2002, there were 2,244 farms in Miami-Dade, covering about 90,000 acres (about 8 percent of the county). Most are in the southwestern portion of the county, said Don Pybas, the Miami-Dade representative of the University of Florida/Institute of Food and Agricultural Science Extension Service.
 Mr. Pybas estimated that in the last five years the amount of agricultural land has declined by at least 20,000 acres.
 Some of that decline is evidenced by the mansions that have popped up on five-acre lots in agricultural sections of Homestead. The houses, some as large as 10,000 square feet, look as if they belong in Beverly Hills, Calif. -- and seem oddly out of place surrounded by fields where migrant workers are picking green beans, zucchini, eggplant and peppers. 
 Ms. Edwards of the farm bureau said she wished the houses weren't there. But if the land outside the boundary is being converted to residential use, she and Mr. Alger said, the line has failed.
 Still, Mr. Alger hopes that by selling some of his land he will have the financial security to hold on to the rest.
 Mr. Alger is the third generation of his family to farm in Homestead, ''and there's the fourth,'' he said, pointing to his son, John W. Alger, 21, who is studying food and resource economics at the University of Florida. 
 The South Miami-Dade watershed study, prepared by consultants at the firm of Keith & Schnars of Fort Lauderdale, will be formally released later this month. It covers more than 4,000 pages and, among other things, would encourage construction of town houses and low-rise condominiums along transportation corridors, even in areas that have traditionally been reserved for single-family homes. 
 But the recommendation that the boundary be retained has received much of the attention. According to Michael Davis, who led the team of 40 consultants preparing the report, ''We believe that most of that undeveloped land and agricultural land outside the U.D.B. needs to be preserved.''
 Mr. Davis predicted that without the boundary, 75 percent of the area's farmland would be lost in the near future. ''I'm puzzled by how the farm bureau can reconcile its position on the U.D.B. with its support for farmers,'' he said.
 Ms. Edwards's family owns a cattle ranch 100 miles north of Homestead, in Okeechobee. Once, she said, livestock was key to Miami-Dade's economy. But as the county's population increased, to nearly 2.5 million in 2000 from 500,000 in 1950, most of the state's agriculture moved to less developed counties.
 Ms. Edwards says she is determined to improve the situation of Miami-Dade farmers. That effort includes lobbying for laws allowing only sterilized potting soil to be brought into the country, to protect American agriculture from imported pests, and for a guest worker program that would provide a reliable supply of legal laborers. 
 Then, too, farmers have a hard time hiring help in a county where the cost of living is high, despite what observers say has been a significant cooling of the housing market in recent months.
 In Homestead, where she lives, Ms. Edwards said, ''vacant units are sitting there that nobody wants to touch, because they're too expensive.'' 
 Nobody knows when the residential market will recover. But the consultants who wrote the watershed study worked from the assumption that 700,000 new residents will move to the 370 square miles of southern Miami-Dade County by 2050.
 Roger M. Carlton, a former city manager of Miami Beach, is chairman of a 30-member advisory committee that worked with the authors of the watershed study. He supports retention of the boundary.
 ''The people are going to come,'' Mr. Carlton said of the predicted population surge. ''It's not a question of whether we manage the growth, but how.''
 Mr. Frost, the former national park superintendent, who is now associated with the local Audubon chapter, said: ''Biscayne Bay is teetering. If we don't protect adjacent land, the bay is in big trouble.''

HEADLINE: Run-Flat Tires: Solving a Problem or Creating One?

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
RUN-FLAT tires, which have been offered on some new cars for the last few years, are a soothing security blanket. They can be driven for miles after losing their air, allowing drivers to delay fixing a flat until there is a safe place to stop and avoiding a harrowing tire change along a busy highway.
 But consumers have begun to report problems with the tires. Jennifer Stockburger, a senior tire-test engineer for Consumer Reports magazine, said the tires offered a safety advantage, but the tire forum on its Web site (consumer.org) had many complaints from run-flat owners about higher-than-expected replacement costs, difficulty getting repairs and what some considered excessive wear.
Some owners have been unhappy enough to make a federal case of it, resulting in two class-action suits. The latest was filed on Monday in United States District Court in Los Angeles against Honda and Michelin. 
 Tire company officials say that run-flats, which typically have stronger sidewalls to support the tire when it loses air, should wear just as well as conventional tires and that problems often result from poor maintenance, including improper inflation.
 Run-flat tires are offered on fewer than 3 percent of the vehicles in North America, said Tom L. Chubb, the vice president for original equipment marketing for Michelin North America, which makes several types of run-flat tires. He sees that growing to 4 percent by 2011.
 Run-flat tires are most often found on luxury vehicles. BMW has been the most enthusiastic proponent among the leading automakers, and seems likely to make the tires standard on most models eventually. Run-flats are also showing up on less expensive cars like the Mini Cooper S. 
 Run-flats have also reached upscale family vehicles including minivans like the all-wheel-drive Toyota Sienna and the Touring edition of the Honda Odyssey.
 Tire makers said that in the case of a blowout, a vehicle with run-flats was easier to control. Automakers like the tires because no spare is necessary. That means the space gained can be used to carry more cargo or make mechanical changes. For example, eliminating the spare tire in the 2004 Toyota Sienna allowed the company to turn a front-wheel-drive minivan into all-wheel drive by making room for a driveshaft.
 The suit filed on Monday is over the Michelin Energy LX4 PAX run-flat used on the 2005-7 Honda Odyssey Touring and as an option on the 2006-7 Acura RL. The suit doesn't dispute that the tires offer a safety advantage, but says buyers were deceived about replacement costs and repairs.
 The PAX, instead of having stronger sidewalls, has a supportive ring inside made of polyurethane. Michelin said the ring allowed a more comfortable ride and better fuel economy because the sidewalls did not need to be so stiff, yet the vehicle was still safe and easy to drive when a tire went flat. But it is that design that makes the PAX more difficult to repair. 
 Michelin stores or car dealers must have special tire-changing equipment that can cost $3,000 to $15,000 depending on what the dealer already has, Chris Naughton, a Honda spokesman, said in an interview before the suit was filed.
 He said some dealers did not have the equipment yet, but that about 90 percent of Honda's roughly 1,000 dealers would have it by the end of this month.
 Mark F. Anderson of San Francisco, one of the lawyers who filed the suit, said it was ''ridiculous'' that repairing a PAX tire should be so complicated. Mr. Anderson also filed a class-action suit in 2005 against Toyota, Bridgestone and Dunlop over run-flats used on the 2004-6 Sienna with all-wheel drive.
 Lynn Mann, a Michelin spokeswoman, said the suit had ''many misstatements and errors.''
 Mr. Naughton of Honda said the company had not seen the suit, but that the tire was a ''great product that provides convenience, added safety and peace of mind for our customers.'' Although not a plaintiff in the suit, Maria V. Ocampo, an Odyssey owner from La Mirada, Calif., has had what she describes as a love and ''there is room for improvement'' relationship with PAX tires.
 She has had two flat tires and loved being able to still get her children to school and reach work on time.
 ''I didn't have to panic,'' Ms. Ocampo said. But she says she has had several disappointments. 
 She had to call Michelin to find a Honda dealer that could repair the tire. Also, she says her tires wore out after 20,000 miles; a Honda dealer recently told her that a new set would cost $1,600, including installation. 
 ''That is a lot of money for us,'' she said. 
 Acura is not requiring its 250 dealers to buy the special repair equipment because few RL's are sold with the PAX, Mr. Naughton said. He said about 15 percent of Acura dealers had the equipment.
 For travelers who can't find a shop to fix the tire, Michelin said it could get a PAX tire and wheel delivered to customers in less than 12 hours.
 The support system doesn't work, said Jean Carper of Key West, Fla., an RL owner and one of the plaintiffs. She said she was stranded on a Saturday in upstate New York with two flat tires last year. She said she could not find a shop to fix the run-flats, was told by a Michelin dealer that it would take five days to receive replacements and had to wait until Monday to order them through an Acura dealer. She had them on her car by Tuesday.
 ''It was a nightmare,'' she said. ''They did not have any facilities anywhere I was.''
 As for the cost, Honda dealers are typically charging about $180 for a PAX tire plus another $60 for labor, Mr. Naughton said. 
 Michelin said a PAX's tread should last about 35,000 miles. One reason some consumers may have thought their tires needed to be replaced is that the design of the shoulder of the PAX can make it look as if that part of the tire is badly worn, Mr. Chubb said.
 Assertions of poor tire wear were the core of the suit against Toyota. In November, an out-of-court settlement was approved in United States District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco. 
 Toyota said there were no problems with the tires, but in the settlement it agreed to expand a tire-replacement program it was already offering.
 Bridgestone and Dunlop, which made the run-flats for the Sienna, also said there were no problems with their tires. However, engineers for the tire companies said in statements filed with the court that they changed the tires' design in 2005, a few months before the suit was filed, to improve wear. They said they made the changes after learning of complaints, which they attributed to improper inflation.
 Still, there is apparently a big range in what Sienna owners can expect for tire wear. A pamphlet that comes with the 2007 Sienna says that the run-flats may get as little as 15,000 miles to 20,000 miles or as much as 40,000, depending on conditions and maintenance.
 Clarence M. Ditlow, the executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said the court statements from Dunlop and Bridgestone engineers showed ''the first-generation run-flat tires for the Sienna were poorly designed and wore out prematurely.''
 ''Whether it is tires or cars, consumers are well advised to avoid new models because they are prone to bugs,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Thinking Green, Not Pumping It

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
WHAT may soon be certified as the nation's first green gas station opened last month at a busy intersection here on the border with Beverly Hills. It's the station itself that's considered green; the unleaded gasoline it sells is not. 
 The owner, BP (formerly British Petroleum), converted a gritty cut-rate station at the site into what it calls a laboratory for environmentally sensitive building technologies. The roof is surfaced with 90 solar panels, and a rainwater collection system irrigates the landscaping. The station was built mostly with recycled materials, including bits of glass mixed into the pavement, which sparkle. Video screens at the pumps show energy-saving tips.
Remember when gas stations were called service stations? This one offers the old-fashioned service of checking tire pressure. The link between proper inflation and high fuel economy is among the many energy tips that workers give to customers. The tips, on recycled paper, are embedded with flower seeds -- the idea is that you will plant the paper.
 ''Everything here is about reuse,'' said Ann Hand, BP's senior vice president for global marketing and innovation.
 The U.S. Green Building Council in Washington, which has certified more than 700 energy-efficient buildings as green, said it expected to certify the facility, making it the first gas station to receive the designation.
 Ms. Hand said BP may eventually sell biodiesel and other alternative fuels there. JERRY GARRETT

HEADLINE: If Life Imitates Art, He's in Big Trouble

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

DATELINE: RYE BROOK 

 BODY:
WHEN Matthew Klein sat down to write his thriller ''Con Ed,'' he had little taste for the standard heroes of the genre. Grizzled cops, feisty pathologists and clever lawyers left him cold. So he took a flier and made his lead character a con man -- albeit a likable one. 
 His protagonist, Kip Largo, has just been released from prison and is trying to go straight. But when his grown son shows up in deep debt, Kip decides to bail him out by pulling off one last scam. He pretends to be a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who starts a high-tech software company that predicts the stock market. Throw some nasty members of the Russian mob, a wealthy Las Vegas developer and a few sexy women into this $20 million stock-manipulation scheme, and you've got Mr. Klein's new novel, to be released by Warner Books on Tuesday. (A book party will be held from 5 to 7 p.m. on Saturday at the Rye Free Reading Room, 1061 Boston Post Road.) 
Mr. Klein, who grew up in Westchester and lives in Rye Brook, is certainly qualified to write about the huge amounts of money that flowed through Silicon Valley at the height of the Internet bubble. The 38-year-old author was one of those archetypal whiz kids who started several technology companies during the boom. He is quick to point out, however, that his familiarity with scams is only a product of ''armchair research.'' 
 Self-described as ''freakishly tall'' -- he is 6 foot 7 -- Mr. Klein projects an air of both deep ambition and self-effacement. He shares with his more rough-hewn protagonist a somewhat forlorn sense of humor and a penchant for big ideas.
 Even during his college days at Yale, Mr. Klein revealed an entrepreneurial bent. He began a business delivering local restaurant food to students in their dorm rooms, and arranged with the university bursar for students to bill food directly to their parents' accounts. After graduating in 1990, he went on to Stanford Business School.
 ''I always thought I wanted to run a business,'' Mr. Klein said. ''I know myself, and I'm really unemployable in the classical sense. I don't listen to people, and I think I know the answers, so that makes me think I should do stuff on my own.''
 He dropped out of business school just one quarter shy of graduating. He had been running a small software company in his apartment in Palo Alto, Calif., and venture capitalists approached him to run the business full time. The company, Release Software, was a personal information manager that could be opened and downloaded remotely, a new concept in 1994. 
 That business didn't pan out, but Mr. Klein soon moved to a second venture, TechPlanet. His idea was to create a national brand of quality-controlled computer service technicians. At one point Mr. Klein had raised $40 million in venture capital, had 400 employees and was spending $1 million a day. So confident was he that he personally guaranteed the company debt. But problems arose. It turned out that few computer system installations were standard. Jobs were complicated, and the company had to hire talented technicians and pay them accordingly. The business kept expanding, with no eye toward profitability. Investors pulled out, and ultimately the venture became what Mr. Klein described as ''a very public, spectacular failure.''
 Lawyers and creditors hounded him. It took him years to dig out. But he is nothing if not resilient, and Mr. Klein came up with yet another idea. His new company, Collective2, audits various algorithmic stock-trading services, tracking their results, and offers a marketplace for those who want to trade using them. Once the company was up and running, he turned his attention to writing ''Con Ed.''
 Writing a novel and writing computer software, he said, aren't as different as one might think. ''There's a lot of aesthetics involved in both, but the elegance of a piece of computer software is sort of private; only the coders know,'' he said. ''The talent lies in the judgment, and I think you need that in writing software and writing novels.'' 
 So Mr. Klein is running a business with software that aims to predict the stock market at the same time that he has written a book about a con artist who runs a company that claims to predict the stock market? Might that make customers a little nervous? 
 ''I hadn't really thought of it that way,'' Mr. Klein said, laughing. ''I think companies pretty much stand on their own, and if you can make money for someone, they're willing to overlook pretty much anything.''

HEADLINE: A Renaissance in Full Bloom for Aging Theaters

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH MAKER

DATELINE: TORRINGTON 

 BODY:
RICK DOYLE remembers when icicles hung from the ceiling and saplings grew amid the mold and broken glass in the lobby of the abandoned Warner Theater in the early 1980s. Despite its artistic history, the 1931 landmark building appeared headed to becoming just another city parking lot.
 Now, 25 years, $20 million and countless hours of labor later, Mr. Doyle stood on the stage, covered from shirt to shoes in spattered paint, gazing across the gilded, 1,765-seat theater and talking about the Warner's ''miraculous'' salvation. 
''What you see here is an incomparable success story, the fruition of hundreds of people's passion and love and sweat and relentless determination,'' said Mr. Doyle, a drama teacher at the Taft School in Watertown. He is one of the many volunteers who not only rescued the theater but are determined to make it a thriving cultural destination that will occupy more than 100,000 square feet in downtown Torrington when it is completed this summer.
 ''This was the place where people came on dates with their future spouses, where they saw Frankenstein's face for the first time, where Bambi's father died,'' Mr. Doyle said, pausing from preparing the set for ''Footloose,'' which was to open the next day and which he was directing.
 ''No one was willing to let that magic die,'' he said.
 That sentiment is saving theaters across Connecticut, inspiring a recent renaissance in the performing arts, with dozens of playhouses undergoing restorations and expansions and attracting, in many cases, record numbers of theatergoers, benefactors and performances.
 ''There is most definitely a building boom going on in the theater world in Connecticut,'' said An-Ming Truxes, the arts director of the State Commission on Culture and Tourism. ''This state is so rich in theatrical offerings, and people are coming out like never before to enjoy it.''
 The state allocated $65 million in bonds for theater projects in the last decade, and the commission gave $555,000 in grants to 25 theaters in the last fiscal year to help with operating costs.
 In Stamford, the Palace Theater, built in 1927, recently underwent a $16 million renovation, and a $2 million project is planned for the subground space, including a 199-seat theater and a new performing arts education center to be named after Pitney Bowes, one of the Palace's benefactors. 
 The Palace is also planning to give the public a kind of theater taste test: In the next few months, it will present ''10-minute pub plays'' in local restaurants and bars, said Ken Wesler, executive officer of the Stamford Center for the Arts, which operates the Palace. ''Think of it as theatrical comfort food, or a mouthwatering appetizer. You give them a little, and they'll want to come to the theater for more.''
 In Waterbury, the Palace Theater, which opened its doors in 1922 but had been closed for 18 years, reopened in 2004 after a $30 million makeover. ''Our ticket sales went up last year to 105,000, from 90,000 the year before,'' said the theater's executive director, Frank Tavera.
 Now the Waterbury Palace has begun a campaign to raise money for operating expenses, ''to make sure it never lies vacant again,'' Mr. Tavera said, adding that Webster Bank had already contributed $1 million.
 The Westport Country Playhouse received a $5 million state grant and raised $25 million to restore the playhouse, an 1800s barn that has operated as a theater since 1931. Of that total, $17 million was spent on renovation and $13 million is for theatrical educational programs. 
 The theater has never been so popular, said the actress Joanne Woodward, a Westport resident who organized the restoration effort. ''Without the renovation, the Westport Country Playhouse could not have survived,'' she said. ''The generosity of so many saved this national treasure for future generations.''
 The same is true in New London, where the Garde Arts Center, built in 1926 as a vaudeville house, was to have been demolished but was saved by volunteers. With a $6.5 million state grant and matching funds raised independently, the group revitalized the Moroccan-style, 1,472-seat theater and ''made it the star attraction in New London,'' said Ned Hammond, the city's economic development coordinator. ''It's totally transformed the city.''
 The Garde is now raising money to build a second theater, one with 140 seats, and expand the backstage, ''so the actors don't have to change their costumes outside in the snow,'' said Steve Sigel, the theater's executive director.
 Among other projects scheduled in the state, the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven has begun a $30 million campaign to build a new theater at a different location; the Hartford Stage and the Thomaston Opera House are planning expansions within five years; and the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam received a state grant to build housing for actors and a new costume storage facility. 
 Also, the Ridgefield Theater Barn, a 75-seat theater where you can bring your own dinner and wine to cloth-covered, candle-lit tables, is to be renovated and expanded next year, and TheatreWorks in New Milford is completing plans for a project that will add bathrooms, enlarge the theater to 200 seats from 120, and add another black-box theater for rehearsals.
 In Torrington, the Warner's executive director, James Patrick, walked along Main Street, showing off a 50,000-square-foot space, next to the theater, that is being transformed from a vacant department store into the Warner's new Carole and Ray Neag Performing Arts Center, named for the benefactors who donated $1 million last year to the project. The center will include classrooms, a new 200-seat theater and several retail stores and restaurants surrounding a grand lobby.
 The record number of ticket sales last year -- 92,000, up from over 80,000 the previous year -- ''shows you how much people love this place,'' Mr. Patrick said. 
 ''And look what the Warner has done for this city,'' he added, pointing across the street at freshly painted building facades and bustling new businesses. ''Torrington has gone from a depressed old mill town to a thriving arts center that's just teeming with life.''

HEADLINE: Nassau Comptroller Warns County on Finances

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
March 1 was a good news-bad news day for Nassau County. On the same day that Thomas R. Suozzi, the county executive, announced that Nassau had a budget surplus for the fifth consecutive year, the county comptroller, Howard S. Weitzman, warned that recurring annual expenses exceed revenues and that by the end of 2007 the county's reserves would be exhausted.
 Mr. Suozzi announced a budget surplus of $45.6 million; Mr. Weitzman announced a structural deficit -- annual expenses exceeding revenues -- of $164 million. 
''Mr. Suozzi's administration has done a great job in managing the county over the last five years, and using the surplus every year to balance the budget was a very effective practice,'' Mr. Weitzman said. ''But we must deal with the realities of little economic growth and increasing expenses.''
 Mr. Weitzman said the 2007 budget included a number of items that might not be achievable, adding, ''Looking ahead to 2008, the cupboard is bare.''
 Last month, he wrote to the county executive and legislative leaders, calling for them to begin now to plan strategies for spending and generating revenues for 2008.
 ''Revenue-raising initiatives are tough in an election year,'' Mr. Weitzman said. ''We are urging the county leaders to sit down now, during the calmer period, to look at options.''
 Mr. Suozzi agreed that the next budget, which must be formally proposed in September, will be a challenge. After four years of no tax increases, he said he would propose a 3.9 percent property tax increase for 2008. 
 But Mr. Suozzi said that he had faced structural gaps before and found ways to balance the budget. He attributed the budget surplus for this year to several factors, including a reduced workforce, a significant cut in borrowing, historic labor concessions, controlled overtime and leaner government spending. 
 In response to Mr. Weitzman's letter, Thomas Stokes, the deputy county executive, said, ''We have already taken action to refine our initiatives for the 2008 budget, and by July should have 98 percent of the budget done.'' Settlement Announced In Superfund Site Cleanup
 The final cleanup of the Li Tungsten Superfund site in Glen Cove will be completed soon if a recent settlement between the federal government and the Environmental Protection Agency is approved.
 On Feb. 28, the Justice Department and the E.P.A. announced the agreement, which will require 18 parties responsible for contributing hazardous wastes to the site -- including corporations, Nassau County and the United States government, which used land and buildings there during and after World War II -- to pay for the remaining cleanup. 
 The settlement agreement, which requires a 30-day public comment period and subsequent judicial approval, would also reimburse the E.P.A. for a significant portion of its past costs for work on the site and return funds to its Hazardous Substance Superfund for use on other sites. 
 Tungsten ores and scrap were processed on the 26-acre Li Tungsten property from 1942 to 1985; the remaining four acres of the Superfund site includes portions of the Captain's Cove property a half mile to the west and portions of adjacent Glen Cove Creek. Cleanup of the area began in the mid-1990s.
 The settlement would require TDY Holdings L.L.C. and TDY Industries Inc., subsidiaries of a company that is the successor to a company that owned Li Tungsten, to perform work valued at $10.7 million; that represents the majority of the remaining cleanup. The other parties will pay $3.6 million to reimburse the E.P.A., and the United States will contribute $26 million toward the cleanup and the payment of the agency's past costs.
 The agency incurred most of its costs from 1989 to 1998 while removing and decontaminating more than 270 tanks used in the tungsten extraction process and demolishing several contaminated and unstable buildings that housed the tanks. Health Commissioner Nominated in Suffolk
 After six months without a commissioner, the Suffolk County Department of Health Services will soon have one: Dr. Humayun Chaudhry has been nominated by County Executive Steve Levy to head the department, overseeing a staff of 1,600. 
 Dr. Chaudhry, 41 and a resident of Commack, is the assistant dean of health policy and chairman of the department of medicine at the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine of the New York Institute of Technology, in Old Westbury. He is also an attending physician at Long Beach Medical Center and Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola.
 ''Having worked at both a hospital and a medical school, this is a natural progression to my next step of taking care of the million and a half people in the county's health care system,'' Dr. Chaudhry said.
 He was nominated March 2 to replace Dr. Brian Harper, who left last September to return to private practice. The County Legislature could vote on Dr. Chaudhry's appointment as early as March 20.
 Dr. Chaudhry, whose salary will be $150,000, said that one of his first goals as commissioner would be to strengthen the health department.
 ''In this county, there is a long list of people who are vulnerable, including the uninsured and underinsured, the elderly and infirm,'' he said. ''We need to be a Department of Health Services for every resident of Suffolk County.''
 Another priority is preparedness for any public health threats.
 ''As commissioner, I will be looking to see how we are prepared and what needs to be updated,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Crisis Looms In Mortgages

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
On March 1, a Wall Street analyst at Bear Stearns wrote an upbeat report on a company that specializes in making mortgages to cash-poor homebuyers. The company, New Century Financial, had already disclosed that a growing number of borrowers were defaulting, and its stock, at around $15, had lost half its value in three weeks.
 What happened next seems all too familiar to investors who bought technology stocks in 2000 at the breathless urging of Wall Street analysts. Last week, New Century said it would stop making loans and needed emergency financing to survive. The stock collapsed to $3.21.
The analyst's untimely call, coupled with a failure among other Wall Street institutions to identify problems in the home mortgage market, isn't the only familiar ring to investors who watched the technology stock bubble burst precisely seven years ago. 
 Now, as then, Wall Street firms and entrepreneurs made fortunes issuing questionable securities, in this case pools of home loans taken out by risky borrowers. Now, as then, bullish stock and credit analysts for some of those same Wall Street firms, which profited in the underwriting and rating of those investments, lulled investors with upbeat pronouncements even as loan defaults ballooned. Now, as then, regulators stood by as the mania churned, fed by lax standards and anything-goes lending. 
 Investment manias are nothing new, of course. But the demise of this one has been broadly viewed as troubling, as it involves the nation's $6.5 trillion mortgage securities market, which is larger even than the United States treasury market. 
 Hanging in the balance is the nation's housing market, which has been a big driver of the economy. Fewer lenders means many potential homebuyers will find it more difficult to get credit, while hundreds of thousands of homes will go up for sale as borrowers default, further swamping a stalled market.
 ''The regulators are trying to figure out how to work around it, but the Hill is going to be in for one big surprise,'' said Josh Rosner, a managing director at Graham-Fisher & Company, an independent investment research firm in New York, and an expert on mortgage securities. ''This is far more dramatic than what led to Sarbanes-Oxley,'' he added, referring to the legislation that followed the WorldCom and Enron scandals, ''both in conflicts and in terms of absolute economic impact.'' 
 While real estate prices were rising, the market for home loans operated like a well-oiled machine, providing ready money to borrowers and high returns to investors like pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds and other institutions. Now this enormous and important machine is sputtering, and the effects are reverberating throughout Main Street, Wall Street and Washington.
 Already, more than two dozen mortgage lenders have failed or closed their doors, and shares of big companies in the mortgage industry have declined significantly. Delinquencies on loans made to less creditworthy borrowers -- known as subprime mortgages --recently reached 12.6 percent. Some banks have reported rising problems among borrowers that were deemed more creditworthy as well. 
 Traders and investors who watch this world say the major participants -- Wall Street firms, credit rating agencies, lenders and investors -- are holding their collective breath and hoping that the spring season for home sales will reinstate what had been a go-go market for mortgage securities. Many Wall Street firms saw their own stock prices decline over their exposure to the turmoil. 
 ''I guess we are a bit surprised at how fast this has unraveled,'' said Tom Zimmerman, head of asset-backed securities research at UBS, in a recent conference call with investors.
 Even now the tone accentuates the positive. In a recent presentation to investors, UBS Securities discussed the potential for losses among some mortgage securities in a variety of housing markets. None of the models showed flat or falling home prices, however. 
 The Bear Stearns analyst who upgraded New Century, Scott R. Coren, wrote in a research note that the company's stock price reflected the risks in its industry, and that the downside risk was about $10 in a ''rescue-sale scenario.'' According to New Century, Bear Stearns is among the firms with a ''longstanding'' relationship financing its mortgage operation. Mr. Coren, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment.
 Others who follow the industry have voiced more caution. Thomas A. Lawler, founder of Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting, said: ''It's not that the mortgage industry is collapsing, it's just that the mortgage industry went wild and there are consequences of going wild. 
 ''I think there is no doubt that home sales are going to be weaker than most anybody who was forecasting the market just two months ago thought. For those areas where the housing market was already not too great, where inventories were at historically high levels and it finally looked like things were stabilizing, this is going to be unpleasant.'' 
 Like worms that surface after a torrential rain, revelations that emerge when an asset bubble bursts are often unattractive, involving dubious industry practices and even fraud. In the coming weeks, some mortgage market participants predict, investors will learn not only how lax real estate lending standards became, but also how hard to value these opaque securities are and how easy their values are to prop up. 
 Owners of mortgage securities that have been pooled, for example, do not have to reflect the prevailing market prices of those securities each day, as stockholders do. Only when a security is downgraded by a rating agency do investors have to mark their holdings to the market value. As a result, traders say, many investors are reporting the values of their holdings at inflated prices.
 ''How these things are valued for portfolio purposes is exposed to management judgment, which is potentially arbitrary,'' Mr. Rosner said.
 At the heart of the turmoil is the subprime mortgage market, which developed to give loans to shaky borrowers or to those with little cash to put down as collateral. Some 35 percent of all mortgage securities issued last year were in that category, up from 13 percent in 2003.
 Looking to expand their reach and their profits, lenders were far too willing to lend, as evidenced by the creation of new types of mortgages -- known as ''affordability products'' -- that required little or no down payment and little or no documentation of a borrower's income. Loans with 40-year or even 50-year terms were also popular among cash-strapped borrowers seeking low monthly payments. Exceedingly low ''teaser'' rates that move up rapidly in later years were another feature of the new loans. 
 The rapid rise in the amount borrowed against a property's value shows how willing lenders were to stretch. In 2000, according to Banc of America Securities, the average loan to a subprime lender was 48 percent of the value of the underlying property. By 2006, that figure reached 82 percent. 
 Mortgages requiring little or no documentation became known colloquially as ''liar loans.'' An April 2006 report by the Mortgage Asset Research Institute, a consulting concern in Reston, Va., analyzed 100 loans in which the borrowers merely stated their incomes, and then looked at documents those borrowers had filed with the I.R.S. The resulting differences were significant: in 90 percent of loans, borrowers overstated their incomes 5 percent or more. But in almost 60 percent of cases, borrowers inflated their incomes by more than half. 
 A Deutsche Bank report said liar loans accounted for 40 percent of the subprime mortgage issuance last year, up from 25 percent in 2001.
 Securities backed by home mortgages have been traded since the 1970s, but it has been only since 2002 or so that investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds and other institutions, have shown such an appetite for them. 
 Wall Street, of course, was happy to help refashion mortgages from arcane and illiquid securities into ubiquitous and frequently traded ones. Its reward is that it now dominates the market. While commercial banks and savings banks had long been the biggest lenders to home buyers, by 2006, Wall Street had a commanding share -- 60 percent -- of the mortgage financing market, Federal Reserve data show. 
 The big firms in the business are Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and UBS. They buy mortgages from issuers, put thousands of them into pools to spread out the risks and then divide them into slices, known as tranches, based on quality. Then they sell them. 
 The profits from packaging these securities and trading them for customers and their own accounts have been phenomenal. At Lehman Brothers, for example, mortgage-related businesses contributed directly to record revenue and income over the last three years.
 The issuance of mortgage-related securities, which include those backed by home-equity loans, peaked in 2003 at more than $3 trillion, according to data from the Bond Market Association. Last year's issuance, reflecting a slowdown in home price appreciation, was $1.93 trillion, a slight decline from 2005. 
 In addition to enviable growth, the mortgage securities market has undergone other changes in recent years. In the 1990s, buyers of mortgage securities spread out their risk by combining those securities with loans backed by other assets, like credit card receivables and automobile loans. But in 2001, investor preferences changed, focusing on specific types of loans. Mortgages quickly became the favorite. 
 Another change in the market involves its trading characteristics. Years ago, mortgage-backed securities appealed to a buy-and-hold crowd, who kept the securities on their books until the loans were paid off. ''You used to think of mortgages as slow moving,'' said Glenn T. Costello, managing director of structured finance residential mortgage at Fitch Ratings. ''Now it has become much more of a trading market, with a mark-to-market bent.''
 The average daily trading volume of mortgage securities issued by government agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, exceeded $250 billion last year. That's up from about $60 billion in 2000. 
 Wall Street became so enamored of the profits in mortgages that it began to expand its reach, buying companies that make loans to consumers to supplement its packaging and sales operations. In August 2006, Morgan Stanley bought Saxon, a $6.5 billion subprime mortgage underwriter, for $706 million. And last September, Merrill Lynch paid $1.3 billion to buy First Franklin Financial, a home lender in San Jose, Calif. At the time, Merrill said it expected First Franklin to add to its earnings in 2007. Now analysts expect Merrill to take a large loss on the purchase.
 Indeed, on Feb. 28, as the first fiscal quarter ended for many big investment banks, Wall Street buzzed with speculation that the firms had slashed the value of their numerous mortgage holdings, recording significant losses.
 As prevailing interest rates remained low over the last several years, the appetite for these securities only rose. In the ever-present search for high yields, buyers clamored for securities that contained subprime mortgages, which carry interest rates that are typically one to two percentage points higher than traditional loans. Mortgage securities participants say increasingly lax lending standards in these loans became almost an invitation to commit mortgage fraud. It is too early to tell how significant a role mortgage fraud played in the rocketing delinquency rates -- 12.6 percent among subprime borrowers. Delinquency rates among all mortgages stood at 4.7 percent in the third quarter of 2006. 
 For years, investors cared little about risks in mortgage holdings. That is changing. 
 ''I would not be surprised if between now and the end of the year at least 20 percent of BBB and BBB- bonds that are backed by subprime loans originated in 2006 will be downgraded,'' Mr. Lawler said. 
 Still, the rating agencies have yet to downgrade large numbers of mortgage securities to reflect the market turmoil. Standard & Poor's has put 2 percent of the subprime loans it rates on watch for a downgrade, and Moody's said it has downgraded 1 percent to 2 percent of such mortgages that were issued in 2005 and 2006. 
 Fitch appears to be the most proactive, having downgraded 3.7 percent of subprime mortgages in the period. 
 The agencies say that they are confident that their ratings reflect reality in the mortgages they have analyzed and that they have required managers of mortgage pools with risky loans in them to increase the collateral. A spokesman for S.& P. said the firm made its ratings requirements more stringent for subprime issuers last summer and that they shored up the loans as a result. 
 Meeting with Wall Street analysts last week, Terry McGraw, chief executive of McGraw-Hill, the parent of S.& P., said the firm does not believe that loans made in 2006 will perform ''as badly as some have suggested.'' 
 Nevertheless, some investors wonder whether the rating agencies have the stomach to downgrade these securities because of the selling stampede that would follow. Many mortgage buyers cannot hold securities that are rated below investment grade -- insurance companies are an example. So if the securities were downgraded, forced selling would ensue, further pressuring an already beleaguered market. 
 Another consideration is the profits in mortgage ratings. Some 6.5 percent of Moody's 2006 revenue was related to the subprime market. 
 Brian Clarkson, Moody's co-chief operating officer, denied that the company hesitates to cut ratings. ''We made assumptions early on that we were going to have worse performance in subprime mortgages, which is the reason we haven't seen that many downgrades,'' he said. ''If we have something that is investment grade that we need to take below investment grade, we will do it.'' 
 Interestingly, accounting conventions in mortgage securities require an investor to mark his holdings to market only when they get downgraded. So investors may be assigning higher values to their positions than they would receive if they had to go into the market and find a buyer. That delays the reckoning, some analysts say. 
 ''There are delayed triggers in many of these investment vehicles and that is delaying the recognition of losses,'' Charles Peabody, founder of Portales Partners, an independent research boutique in New York, said. ''I do think the unwind is just starting. The moment of truth is not yet here.''
 On March 2, reacting to the distress in the mortgage market, a throng of regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, asked lenders to tighten their policies on lending to those with questionable credit. Late last week, WMC Mortgage, General Electric's subprime mortgage arm, said it would no longer make loans with no down payments. 
 Meanwhile, investors wait to see whether the spring home selling season will shore up the mortgage market. If home prices do not appreciate or if they fall, defaults will rise, and pension funds and others that embraced the mortgage securities market will have to record losses. And they will likely retreat from the market, analysts said, affecting consumers and the overall economy. 
 A paper published last month by Mr. Rosner and Joseph R. Mason, an associate professor of finance at Drexel University's LeBow College of Business, assessed the potential problems associated with disruptions in the mortgage securities market. They wrote: ''Decreased funding for residential mortgage-backed securities could set off a downward spiral in credit availability that can deprive individuals of home ownership and substantially hurt the U.S. economy.''

HEADLINE: Between Black and Immigrant Muslims, an Uneasy Alliance

BYLINE: By ANDREA ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Under the glistening dome of a mosque on Long Island, hundreds of men sat cross-legged on the floor. Many were doctors and engineers born in Pakistan and India. Dressed in khakis, polo shirts and the odd silk tunic, they fidgeted and whispered. 
 One thing stood between them and dinner: A visitor from Harlem was coming to ask for money.
A towering black man with a gray-flecked beard finally swept into the room, his bodyguard trailing him. Wearing a long, embroidered robe and matching hat, he took the microphone and began talking about a different group of Muslims, the thousands of African-Americans who have found Islam in prison. 
 ''We are all brothers and sisters,'' said the visitor, known as Imam Talib. 
 The men stared. To some of them, it seemed, he was from another planet. As the imam returned their gaze, he had a similar sensation. ''They live in another world,'' he later said.
 Only 28 miles separate Imam Talib's mosque in Harlem from the Islamic Center of Long Island. The congregations they each serve -- African-Americans at the city mosque and immigrants of South Asian and Arab descent in the suburbs -- represent the largest Muslim populations in the United States. Yet a vast gulf divides them, one marked by race and class, culture and history.
 For many African-American converts, Islam is an experience both spiritual and political, an expression of empowerment in a country they feel is dominated by a white elite. For many immigrant Muslims, Islam is an inherited identity, and America a place of assimilation and prosperity.
 For decades, these two Muslim worlds remained largely separate. But last fall, Imam Talib hoped to cross that distance in a venture that has become increasingly common since Sept. 11. Black Muslims have begun advising immigrants on how to mount a civil rights campaign. Foreign-born Muslims are giving African-Americans roles of leadership in some of their largest organizations. The two groups have joined forces politically, forming coalitions and backing the same candidates.
 It is a tentative and uneasy union, seen more typically among leaders at the pulpit than along the prayer line. But it is critical, a growing number of Muslims believe, to surviving a hostile new era. 
 ''Muslims will not be successful in America until there is a marriage between the indigenous and immigrant communities,'' said Siraj Wahhaj, an African-American imam in New York with a rare national following among immigrant Muslims. ''There has to be a marriage.''
 The divide between black and immigrant Muslims reflects a unique struggle facing Islam in America. Perhaps nowhere else in the world are Muslims from so many racial, cultural and theological backgrounds trying their hands at coexistence. Only in Mecca, during the obligatory hajj, or pilgrimage, does such diversity in the faith come to life, between black and white, rich and poor, Sunni and Shiite.
 ''This is a new experiment in the history of Islam,'' said Ali S. Asani, a professor of Islamic studies at Harvard University.
 That evening in October, Imam Al-Hajj Talib 'Abdur-Rashid drove to Westbury, on Long Island, with a task he would have found unthinkable years ago. 
 He would ask for donations from the immigrant community he refers to, somewhat bitterly, as the ''Muslim elite.''
 But he needed funds, and the doors of immigrant mosques seemed to be opening. Imam Talib and other African-American leaders had formed a national ''indigenous Muslim'' organization, and he knew that during the holy month of Ramadan, the Islamic Center of Long Island could raise thousands of dollars in an evening. 
 It is a place where BMWs and Mercedes-Benzes fill the parking lot, and Coach purses are perched along prayer lines.
 In Harlem, many of Imam Talib's congregants get to the mosque by bus or subway, and warm themselves with space heaters in a drafty, brick building.
 Before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Imam Talib had only a distant connection to the Islamic Center of Long Island. In passing, he had met Faroque Khan, an Indian-born doctor who helped found the mosque, but the two had little in common.
 Imam Talib, 56, is a thundering prison chaplain whose mosque traces its roots to Malcolm X. He is a first-generation Muslim.
 Dr. Khan, 64, is a mild-mannered pulmonologist who collects Chinese antiques and learned to ski on the slopes of Vermont. He is a first-generation American.
 But in the turmoil that followed Sept. 11, the imam and the doctor found themselves unexpectedly allied. 
 ''The more separate we stay, the more targeted we become,'' Dr. Khan said.
 Each man recognizes what the other has to offer. African-Americans possess a cultural and historical fluency that immigrants lack, said Dr. Khan; they hold an unassailable place in America from which to defend their faith. 
 For Imam Talib, immigrants provide a crucial link to the Muslim world and its tradition of scholarship, as well as the wisdom that comes with an ''unshattered Islamic heritage.''
 Both groups have their practical virtues, too. African-Americans know better how to mobilize in America, both men say, and immigrants tend to have deeper pockets.
 Still, it is one thing to talk about unity, Imam Talib said, and another to give it life. Before his visit to Long Island last fall, he had never asked Dr. Khan and his mosque to match their rhetoric with money.
 ''You have to have a litmus test,'' he said.One Faith, Many Histories
 Imam Talib and Dr. Khan did not warm to each other when they met in May 2000, at a gathering in Chicago of Muslim leaders. 
 The imam found the silver-haired doctor faintly smug and paternalistic. It was an attitude he had often whiffed from well-to-do immigrant Muslims. Dr. Khan found Imam Talib straightforward to the point of bluntness.
 The uneasy introduction was, for both men, emblematic of the strained relationship between their communities.
 Imam Talib and other black Muslims trace their American roots to the arrival of Muslims from West Africa as slaves in the South. That historical link gave rise to Islam-inspired movements in the 20th century, the most significant of which was the Nation of Islam.
 The man who founded the Nation in 1930, W. D. Fard, spread the message that American blacks belonged to a lost Muslim tribe and were superior to the ''white, blue-eyed devils'' in their midst. Under Mr. Fard's successor, Elijah Muhammad, the Nation flourished in the 1960s amid the civil rights struggle and the emergence of a black-separatist movement. 
 Overseas, Islamic scholars found the group's teachings on race antithetical to the faith. The schism narrowed after 1975, when Mr. Muhammad's son Warith Deen Mohammed took over the Nation, bringing it in line with orthodox Sunni Islam. Louis Farrakhan parted ways with Mr. Mohammed -- taking the Nation's name and traditional teachings with him -- but the majority of African-American adherents came to embrace the same Sunni practice that dominates the Muslim world.
 Still, divisions between African-American and immigrant Muslims remained pronounced long after the first large waves of South Asians and Arabs arrived in the United States in the 1960s.
 Today, of the estimated six million Muslims who live in the United States, about 25 percent are African-American, 34 percent are South Asian and 26 percent are Arab, said John Zogby, a pollster who has studied the American Muslim population.
 ''Given the extreme from which we came, I would say that the immigrant Muslims have been brotherly toward us,'' Warith Deen Mohammed, who has the largest following of African-American Muslims, said in an interview. ''But I think they're more skeptical than they admit they are. I think they feel more comfortable with their own than they feel with us.''
 For many African-Americans, conversion to Islam has meant parting with mainstream culture, while Muslim immigrants have tended toward assimilation. Black converts often take Arabic names, only to find foreign-born Muslims introducing themselves as ''Moe'' instead of ''Mohammed.''
 The tensions are also economic. Like Dr. Khan, many Muslim immigrants came to the United States with advanced degrees and quickly prospered, settling in the suburbs. For decades, African-Americans watched with frustration as immigrants sent donations to causes overseas, largely ignoring the problems of poor Muslims in the United States. 
 Imam Talib found it impossible to generate interest at immigrant mosques in the 1999 police shooting of Amadou Diallo, who was Muslim. ''What we've found is when domestic issues jump up, like police brutality, all the sudden we're by ourselves,'' he said.
 Some foreign-born Muslims say they are put off by the racial politics of many black converts. They struggle to understand why African-American Muslims have been reluctant to meet with law enforcement officials in the wake of Sept. 11. For their part, black Muslim leaders complain that immigrants have failed to learn their history, which includes a pattern of F.B.I. surveillance dating back to the roots of the Nation of Islam.
 The ironies are, at times, stinging.
 ''From the immigrant community, I hear that African-Americans have to learn how to work in the system,'' said Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations, adding that this was not his personal opinion.
 At the heart of the conflict is a question of leadership. Much to the ire of African-Americans, many immigrants see themselves as the rightful leaders of the faith in America by virtue of their Islamic schooling and fluency in Arabic, the original language of the Koran.
 ''What does knowing Arabic have to do with the quality of your prayer, your fast, your relationship with God?'' asked Ihsan Bagby, an associate professor of Islamic studies at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. ''But African-Americans have to ask themselves why have they not learned more in these years.''
 Every year in Chicago, the two largest Muslim conventions in the country -- one sponsored by an immigrant organization and the other by Mr. Mohammed's -- take place on the same weekend, in separate parts of the city.
 The long-simmering tension boiled over into a public rift with the 2000 presidential elections. That year, a powerful coalition of immigrant Muslims endorsed George W. Bush (because of a promise to stop the profiling of Arabs). 
 The nation's most prominent African-American Muslims complained that they were never consulted. The following summer, when Imam Talib vented his frustration at a meeting with immigrant leaders in Washington, a South Asian man turned to him, he recalled, and said, ''I don't understand why all of you African-American Muslims are always so angry about everything.''
 Imam Talib searched for an answer he thought the man could understand.
 ''African-Americans are like the Palestinians of this land,'' he finally said. ''We're not just some angry black people. We're legitimately outraged and angry.''
 The room fell silent.
 Soon after, black leaders announced the creation of the Muslim Alliance in North America, their first national ''indigenous'' organization.
 But the fallout over the elections was soon eclipsed by Sept. 11, when Muslim immigrants found themselves under intense public scrutiny. They began complaining about ''profiling'' and ''flying while brown,'' appropriating language that had been largely the domain of African-Americans.
 It was around this time that Dr. Khan became, as he put it, enlightened. A few weeks before the terrorist attacks, he read the book ''Black Rage,'' by William H. Grier and Price M. Cobbs. The book, published in 1968, explores the psychological woes of African-Americans, and how the impact of racism is carried through generations.
 ''It helped me understand that even before you're born, things that happened a hundred years ago can affect you,'' Dr. Khan said. ''That was a big change in my thinking.'' 
 He sent an e-mail message to fellow Muslims, including Imam Talib, sharing what he had learned. 
 The Harlem imam was pleased, if not yet convinced.
 ''I just encouraged the brother to keep going,'' Imam Talib said.An Oasis in Harlem
 One windswept night in Harlem, cars rolled past the corner of West 113th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue. A police siren blared as men huddled by a neon-lit Laundromat.
 Across the street stood a brown brick building, lifeless from the outside. But upstairs, in a cozy carpeted room, rows of men and women chanted. 
 ''Ya Hakim. Ya Allah.'' O wise one. O God.
 Imam Talib led the chant, swathed in a black satin robe. It was Ramadan's holiest evening, the Night of Power. As the voices died down, he spotted his bodyguard swaying.
 ''Take it easy there, Captain,'' Imam Talib said. ''As long as you don't jump and shout it's all right.''
 Laughter trickled through the mosque, where a translucent curtain separated men in skullcaps from women in African-print gowns. 
 ''We're just trying to be ourselves, you know?'' Imam Talib said. ''Within the tradition.'' 
 ''That's right,'' said one woman. 
 The imam continued: ''And we can't let other people, from other cultures, come and try to make us clones of them. We came here as Muslims.'' 
 He was feeling drained. He had just returned from the Manhattan Detention Complex, where he works as a chaplain. Some of the mosque's men were back in jail. 
 ''We need power,'' he said quietly. ''Without that, we'll destroy ourselves.''
 Since its birth in 1964, the Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood has been a fortress of stubborn faith, persevering through the crack wars, welfare, AIDS, gangs, unemployment, diabetes, broken families and gentrification. 
 The mosque was founded in a Brooklyn apartment by Shaykh-'Allama Al-Hajj K. Ahmad Tawfiq, a follower of Malcolm X. The Sunni congregation boomed in the 1970s, starting a newspaper and opening a school and a health food store. 
 With city loans, it bought its current building. Fourteen families moved in, creating a bold Muslim oasis in a landscape of storefront churches and liquor stores. The mosque claimed its corner by drenching the sidewalk in dark green paint, the color associated with Islam.
 The paint has since faded. The school is closed. Many of the mosque's members can no longer afford to live in a neighborhood where brownstones sell for millions of dollars. 
 But an aura of dignity prevails. The women normally pray one floor below the men, in a scrubbed, tidy room scented with incense. Their bathroom is a shrine of gold curtains and lavender soaps. A basket of nylon roses hides a hole in the wall.
 Most of the mosque's 160 members belong to the working class, and up to a third of the men are former convicts.
 Some congregants are entrepreneurs, professors, writers and musicians. Mos Def and Q-Tip have visited with Imam Talib, who carries the nickname ''hip-hop imam.'' 
 Mosque celebrations are a blend of Islam and Harlem. In October, at the end of Ramadan, families feasted on curried chicken and collard greens, grilled fish and candied yams. 
 Just before the afternoon prayer, a lean man in a black turtleneck rose to give the call. He was Yusef Salaam, whose conviction in the Central Park jogger case was later overturned. 
 Many of the mosque's members embraced Islam in search of black empowerment, not black separatism. They describe racial equality as a central tenet of their faith. Yet for some, the promise of Islam has been at odds with the reality of Muslims.
 One member, Aqilah Mu'Min, lives in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, a heavily Bangladeshi neighborhood. Whenever she passes women in head scarves, she offers the requisite Muslim greeting. Rarely is it returned. ''We have a theory that says Islam is perfect, human beings are not,'' said Ms. Mu'Min, a city fraud investigator. 
 It was the simplicity of Islam that drew Imam Talib.
 Raised a Christian, he spent the first part of his youth in segregated North Carolina. As a teenager, he read ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'' twice. He began educating himself about the faith at age 19, when as an aspiring actor he was cast in a play about a man who had left the Nation of Islam. 
 But his conversion was more spiritual than political, he said.
 ''I'd like to think that even if I was a white man, I'd still be a Muslim because that's the orientation of my soul,'' the imam said.
 He has learned some Arabic, and traveled once to the Middle East, for hajj. Yet he feels more comfortable with the Senegalese and Guinean Muslims who have settled in Harlem than with many Arabs and South Asians. 
 He is trying to reach out, but is often disappointed. 
 In November, he accepted a last-minute invitation to meet with hundreds of immigrants at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York, an opulent mosque on East 96th Street. 
 The group, the Coalition for Muslim School Holidays, was trying to persuade the city to recognize two Muslim holidays on the school calendar. The effort, Imam Talib learned, had been nearly a year in the making, and no African-American leaders had been consulted.
 He was stunned. After all, he had led a similar campaign in the 1980s, resulting in the suspension of alternate-side parking for the same holidays.
 ''They are unaware of the foundations upon which they are standing,'' he said.Backlash in the Suburbs
 Brush Hollow Road winds through a quiet stretch of Long Island, past churches and diners and leafy cul-de-sacs. In this tranquil tableau, the Islamic Center of Long Island announces itself proudly, a Moorish structure of white concrete topped by a graceful dome. 
 Sleek sedans and S.U.V.'s circle the property as girls with Barbie backpacks hop out and scurry to the Islamic classes they call ''Sunday school.''
 It is a testament to America's influence on the mosque that its liveliest time of the week is not Friday, Islam's holy day, but Sunday. 
 Boys in hooded sweatshirts smack basketballs along the pavement by a sign that reads ''No pray, no play.'' Young mothers in Burberry coats exchange kisses and chatter. 
 For members of the mosque -- many of whom work in Manhattan and cannot make the Friday prayer -- Sunday is the day to reflect and connect.
 The treasurer, Rizwan Qureshi, frantically greeted drivers one Sunday morning with a flier advertising a fund-raiser.
 ''We're trying to get Barack Obama,'' Mr. Qureshi, a banker born in Karachi, told a woman in a gold-hued BMW. 
 ''We need some real money,'' he called out to another driver.
 The mosque began with a group of doctors, engineers and other professionals from Pakistan and India who settled in Nassau County in the early 1970s.
 ''Our kids would come home from school and say, 'Where is my Christmas tree, my Hanukkah lights?' '' recalled Dr. Khan, who lives in nearby Jericho. ''We didn't want them to grow up unsure of who they are.''
 Since opening in 1993, the mosque has thrived, with assets now valued at more than $3 million. Hundreds of people pray there weekly, and thousands come on Muslim holidays. 
 The mosque has an unusually modern, democratic air. Men and women worship with no partition between them. A different scholar delivers the Friday sermon every week, in English. 
 Perhaps most striking, a majority of female worshipers do not cover their heads outside the mosque.
 ''I think it's important to find the fine line between the religion and the age in which we live,'' said Nasreen Wasti, 43, a contract analyst for Lufthansa. ''I'm sure I will have to answer to God for not covering myself. But I'm also satisfied by many of the good deeds I am doing.''
 She and other members use words like ''progressive'' to describe their congregation. But after Sept. 11, a different image took hold.
 In October 2001, a Newsday article quoted a member of the mosque as asking ''who really benefits from such a horrible tragedy that is blamed on Muslims and Arabs?'' A co-president of the mosque was also quoted saying that Israel ''would benefit from this tragedy.''
 Conspiracy theories about Sept. 11 have long circulated among Muslims, and Dr. Khan had heard discussion among congregants. Such talk, he said, was the product of two forces: a deep mistrust of America's motives in the Middle East and a refusal, among many Muslims, to engage in self-criticism.
 ''You blame the other guy for your own shortcomings,'' said Dr. Khan.
 He visited synagogues and churches after the article ran, reassuring audiences that the comments did not reflect the official position of the mosque, which condemned the attacks.
 But to Congressman Peter T. King, whose district is near the mosque, that condemnation fell short. He began publicly criticizing Dr. Khan, asserting that he had failed to fully denounce the statements made by the men. 
 ''He's definitely a radical,'' Mr. King said of Dr. Khan in an interview. ''You cannot, in the context of Sept. 11, allow those statements to be made and not be a radical.''
 When asked about Mr. King's comments, Dr. Khan replied proudly, ''I thought we had freedom of speech.''
 It hardly seems possible that Mr. King and Dr. Khan were once friends. 
 Mr. King used to dine at Dr. Khan's home. He attended the wedding of Dr. Khan's son, Arif, in 1995. At the mosque's opening, it was Mr. King who cut the ribbon.
 After Sept. 11, the mosque experienced the sort of social backlash felt by Muslims around the country. Anonymous callers left threatening messages, and rocks were hurled at children from passing cars. 
 The attention waned over time. But Mr. King cast a new light on the mosque in 2004 with the release of his novel ''Vale of Tears.''
 In the novel, terrorists affiliated with a Long Island mosque demolish several buildings, killing hundreds of people. One of the central characters is a Pakistani heart surgeon whose friendship with a congressman has grown tense. 
 ''By inference, it's me,'' Dr. Khan said of the Pakistani character. (Mr. King said it was a ''composite character'' based on several Muslims he knows.) 
 For Dr. Khan, his difficulties after Sept. 11 come as proof that Muslims cannot stay fragmented. ''It's a challenge for the whole Muslim community -- not just for me,'' he said. ''United we stand, divided we fall.''The Litmus Test
 Imam Talib and his bodyguard set off to Westbury before dusk on Oct. 14. They passed a fork on the Long Island Expressway, and the imam peered out the window. None of the signs were familiar.
 He checked his watch and saw that he was late, adding to his unease. He had visited the mosque a few times before, but never felt entirely at home.
 ''I'm conscious of being a guest,'' he said. ''They treat me kindly and nicely. But I know where I am.''
 At the Islamic Center of Long Island, Dr. Khan was also getting nervous. Hundreds of congregants had gathered after fasting all day for Ramadan. The scent of curry drifted mercilessly through the mosque.
 Dr. Khan sprang to his feet and took the microphone. He improvised.
 ''All of us need to learn from and understand the contributions of the Muslim indigenous community,'' he said. ''Starting with Malcolm X.''
 It had been six years since Imam Talib and Dr. Khan first encountered each other in Chicago. Back then, Imam Talib rarely visited immigrant mosques, and Dr. Khan had only a peripheral connection to African-American Muslims.
 In the 1980s, the doctor had become aware of the high number of Muslim inmates while working as the chief of medicine for a hospital in Nassau County that oversaw health care at the county prison. His mosque began donating prayer rugs, Korans and skullcaps to prisoners around the country. But his interaction with black Muslim leaders was limited until Sept. 11.
 After Dr. Khan read the book ''Black Rage,'' he and Imam Talib began serving together on the board of a new political task force. Finally, in 2005, Dr. Khan invited the imam to his mosque to give the Friday sermon.
 That February, Imam Talib rose before the Long Island congregation. Blending verses in the Koran with passages from recent American history, he urged the audience to learn from the civil rights movement. 
 Dr. Khan listened raptly. Afterward, over sandwiches, he asked Imam Talib for advice. He wanted to thaw the relationship between his mosque and African-American mosques on Long Island. The conversation continued for hours.
 ''The real searching for an answer, searching for a solution, was coming from Dr. Khan,'' said Imam Talib. ''I could just feel it.''
 Dr. Khan began inviting more African-American leaders to speak at his mosque, and welcomed Imam Talib there last October to give a fund-raising pitch for his organization, the Muslim Alliance in North America. The group had recently announced a ''domestic agenda,'' with programs to help ex-convicts find housing and jobs and to standardize premarital counseling for Muslims in America.
 After the imam arrived that evening and spoke, he sat on the floor next to a blazer-clad Dr. Khan. As they feasted on kebabs, the doctor made a pitch of his own: The teenagers of his mosque could spend a day at Imam Talib's mosque, as the start of a youth exchange program. The imam nodded slowly. 
 Minutes later, the mosque's president, Habeeb Ahmed, hurried over. The congregants had so far pledged $10,000.
 ''Alhamdulillah,'' the imam said. Praise be to God. 
 It was the most Imam Talib had raised for his group in one evening.
 As the dinner drew to a close, the imam looked for his bodyguard. They had a long drive home and he did not want to lose his way again. 
 Dr. Khan asked Imam Talib how he had gotten lost.
 ''Inner city versus the suburbs,'' the imam replied a bit testily. 
 Then he smiled.
 ''The only thing it proves,'' he said, ''is that I need to come by here more often.''

HEADLINE: Catching A Wave of High-Tech Exports

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

 BODY:
IT would be easy to conclude that American exports rose 12.7 percent in 2006 because of the cheaper dollar, which made commodities like corn and wheat much more affordable to international buyers.
 That is part of the export picture, certainly. But it may not be the most important explanation of the surge in the value of the goods that Americans ship overseas.
Ask people in Waterloo, Iowa. There, at a factory, thousands of workers are building high-tech John Deere tractors that are equipped with satellite-tracking technology and are intended for export to China, India, Central Europe and the former Soviet republics in Central Asia, among other destinations. Foreign sales of these tractors have doubled in the last five years. ''There are more lines of computer code in these tractors than there is in the space shuttle,'' says Dave Everitt, president of the North America, Australian and Asian regions of the agricultural division of Deere & Company. 
 Although the cheaper dollar has helped, particularly in sales to Western Europe, the tractors are selling because they can be guided precisely by satellite and because of an ''intelligent power'' system that can provide extra horsepower when needed while still meeting emission requirements. ''We are not competing on cost. We are not competing on volume,'' Mr. Everitt says. ''We are competing on providing value to the customer.'' 
 Deere makes midrange tractors in Brazil, China, Germany, India and Mexico, but the larger, more sophisticated ones are made in the United States.
 Also noteworthy is where the sales growth is occurring. Increasingly, countries in Asia, Latin America and the former Soviet bloc are emerging not just as providers of cheap labor, but also as increasingly vibrant markets for Deere and others. American companies are making many of the durable goods and other capital equipment these countries need to improve their infrastructures in agriculture, health care, food distribution and other areas. 
 In agriculture, for example, these countries are trying to improve the nutritional value of the food they consume. ''That means beef as opposed to grain,'' Mr. Everitt says. ''And the higher order diets require more food, and you have to mechanize to do that.'' 
 American exports of manufactured products have benefited from years of technological and productivity gains, and not just currency swings. ''We are outpacing the Europeans and Japanese in terms of product development and productivity,'' said Peter Morici, an economist at the University of Maryland. ''The U.S. manufacturing sector has the highest level of productivity in the world, especially in durable goods. We make more stuff with fewer people.''
 United States exports of goods crossed the $1 trillion threshold in 2006, according to the Census Bureau. About 67 percent of exports were manufactured goods, Professor Morici estimated. The dollar has declined about 17 percent against the currencies of major trading partners since January 2002, providing a boost for exports of manufactured goods as well as commodities. 
 Large multinational companies have an advantage in exporting because it is easier for them to set up sales and marketing networks and technical support operations, as well as bases for the manufacturing of lower-end products abroad. Caterpillar, for example, exported $10 billion worth of construction equipment last year, even though it has extensive offshore manufacturing. 
 The Pratt & Whitney division of United Technologies is exporting more engines to nations that are expanding their airlines, and Applied Materials is exporting 80 percent of its semiconductor equipment to countries, mostly in Asia, that are building their chip industries.
 But medium-size players are also in the game. The Sealed Air Corporation, a $4.3 billion-a-year company based in Elmwood Park, N.J., is exporting intravenous fluid bags to China from a factory in Duncan, S.C. The reason is that the Chinese government-run health care system is trying to improve its level of care. ''The Chinese health care market has relied on upside-down glass bottles for IV solutions,'' says William V. Hickey, chief executive of Sealed Air. Those glass bottles are not as hygienic as plastic IV bags, require more storage space and are prone to breaking, he says. 
 Although the company's exports of the IV bags are still less than $100 million a year, they are growing at a double-digit clip. Sealed Air is expanding the South Carolina plant, which includes a hermetically sealed ''clean room,'' where the bags are made. 
 ''We do make some relatively low-technology packaging products in our two plants in China,'' he said. ''But the IV bags are extremely sophisticated. There are six or seven distinct layers of plastic and you need different kinds of materials to provide oxygen barriers and to allow flexibility.'' All told, 52 percent of the products made by Sealed Air, which invented Bubble Wrap packaging, are sold outside the United States.
 LIKE their bigger siblings, midtier companies often rely on a mix of manufacturing in other countries as well as exporting from the United States. 
 ''The notion that major multinationals make everything offshore and smaller and medium-sized guys are pure exporters is pretty much a myth,'' said John Endean, president of the American Business Conference, which represents small and midsized businesses. ''Some of the most successful smaller exporters pretty much follow the same pattern as the big guys do.''
 Although companies that have less than, say, $100 million in sales still find it difficult to export -- because financing can be difficult to obtain and the shipment of products is complex and expensive -- the odds are that the American export machine will continue to increase its sales. 
 ''We know that the emerging countries have done well over the past several years,'' said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics in Cleveland. ''They're coming up the income curve. Once they've done that, they want to live like we live. That's the great hope. That's why I firmly believe the export sector is probably going to be the standout sector of the U.S. economy for many years to come.''
 To be sure, exports are not likely to wipe out the trade deficit in the foreseeable future, partly because of America's ravenous appetite for imported petroleum and for consumer goods from China. But as long as the world's thirst for higher living standards continues, American exports of manufactured goods will be on the rise.

HEADLINE: Just for Laughs: Newer Than New Wave

BYLINE: By TERRENCE RAFFERTY

 BODY:
FOR five decades the brilliant French filmmaker Eric Rohmer, now 86, has been writing and directing quiet, pensive, rigorously unemphatic comedies about the baffled relations between men and women. Because his pictures are (at least superficially) so similar, and because they tend to be pretty much action free, it's not always easy to remember which is which. 
 ''Claire's Knee'' (1970) is simple enough: That's the one in which a middle-aged man becomes obsessed with the title joint of the title girl. And the central event of ''My Night at Maud's'' (1969) is, of course, that all-night conversation about Pascal between an uptight, earnestly Catholic guy and a sultry woman who is not his fiancee. ''Chloe in the Afternoon'' (1972), the concluding film in Mr. Rohmer's series of ''Six Moral Tales,'' is a bit wispier in memory. Could that be the one in which the hero takes Viagra and gets so painfully aroused he has to be rushed to the emergency room? 
 No, that can't be right. The little blue pill didn't exist in 1972; and although Mr. Rohmer's films have dealt with many of the stickier intricacies of sexual attraction, they have never displayed the slightest interest in the wacky complications of a massive and prolonged erection. The Viagra scene can, however, be found in a new, improbable remake of ''Chloe in the Afternoon,'' called ''I Think I Love My Wife'' (opening Friday). It is directed and co-written by its star, the not notably quiet, pensive or unemphatic Chris Rock.
 As incongruous as this sounds, we can all imagine worse: say, the Farrelly brothers' ''There's Something About Claire,'' with Jack Black ogling a particular body part or ''In the Company of Maud,'' in which Jimmy Kimmel, after arguing epistemology with Sarah Silverman into the wee hours, cries, ''Thus do I refute Bishop Berkeley!'' slaps her around and posts humiliating pictures of her on the Internet. 
 The notion of Chris Rock as a Rohmer hero, while maybe a tad counterintuitive, doesn't seem impossible, anyway. And in the spirit of fairness it's probably wise for ticket-holders to leave at the door all traces of art-house attitude, any lingering suspicion that a French-speaking domestic comedy is inherently too precious an objet to be entrusted to the rough handling of Americans. ''Chloe in the Afternoon'' is a darn good movie, but there's no sense getting reverent about a picture whose lead actress goes by the name Zouzou and whose hero has a closet full of turtlenecks.
 Mr. Rock and his co-writer, Louis C. K., retain the original's most radical and least audience-friendly property: ''I Think I Love My Wife'' is, like ''Chloe'' (and the other ''Moral Tales''), a film about not having sex, about the process by which a man reaches a conscious, fully informed decision not to satisfy a particular carnal desire. (Mr. Rohmer's women are uniformly hot, so this choice is never arrived at lightly.) 
 This is like making an action movie without explosions, a boxing picture with no knockdowns, a cop thriller in which the hero never pulls his gun out of its holster. Mr. Rohmer's trick is to give his viewers the sense that under certain circumstances the denial of physical satisfaction can itself be a keen satisfaction of a different kind; he makes his protagonists' renunciations feel like consummations. (It probably helps to be Catholic.)
 This is not Mr. Rock's trick. Even for a comedian as inventive as he is, it's a challenge to find the funny in the moral theology of renunciation. Actually, he doesn't try that hard. From the first scenes, in which his character, a suburban husband and father, tells us in voiceover that his wife won't make love with him anymore, it's clear that Mr. Rock has decided to translate ''renunciation'' as ''frustration,'' because that's something he's fairly sure can get laughs. 
 ''Chloe in the Afternoon'' supplies no information on the sexual health of its suburban couple's marriage, no indication that frequency of conjugal relations is a burning issue for either the hero or his wife. When Mr. Rohmer's suburban pere de famille, Alexandre (Bernard Verley), begins to feel tempted by Chloe (Zouzou) -- the free-spirited ex of an old friend -- you sense that his adulterous impulses have more to do with his ambivalence about respectability that they do with any specific marital grievance, or even with the specific allure of Chloe. There's a hint of that existential semi-malaise in the intense attraction of Mr. Rock's character, Richard, to his Chloe figure, Nikki (Gina Torres). But mostly he's really randy.
 Does this explicitness about the hero's motivation violate the spirit of the original? Yes indeed. The more interesting question, though, is whether transgressions like this are arbitrary or -- in a case where the source material is from a very different culture and a very different time -- inevitable. In remakes, as in marriages, fidelity is rarely as uncomplicated a question as it looks.
 It's an especially vexing issue here because ''Chloe in the Afternoon'' (to which the terrific Criterion DVD box set of the ''Six Moral Tales'' has recently restored its proper title, ''Love in the Afternoon'') is a product of the French New Wave, whose highest value was individuality: the profoundly personal expressiveness without which a filmmaker can only be considered -- sneeringly -- a director, never an auteur. How do you remake a movie whose essential quality, whose entire reason for being, is that it couldn't have been made by anybody else? Remaking a New Wave film is kind of like being in what used to be called, circa 1972, an ''open'' marriage: If you're faithful, you're unfaithful.
 Which is why Hollywood versions of New Wave pictures are about as infrequent these days as proudly ''open'' marriages: moviemaking, like matrimony, is demanding enough without adding insoluble, squaring-the-circle conundrums to the experience. It's not as if American studios have ever been shy about lifting plots from foreign films -- the most recent best picture Oscar, after all, went to ''The Departed,'' a remake of a Hong Kong gangster movie, and the French cinema has over the years contributed more than its share of ready-to-wear storylines to our vast retail-entertainment industry. (For a while in the '80s and early '90s it seemed as if every other Hollywood comedy was a glossy remake of some frenetic, winking Gallic farce.) But the extensive inventory of films by Francois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Rivette, Alain Resnais, Jacques Demy, Agnes Varda and Mr. Rohmer has been left largely untouched. 
 And when you look at the handful of exceptions, that policy of benign neglect seems, on the whole, a good idea. Remember ''Willie and Phil,'' Paul Mazursky's version of Mr. Truffaut's ''Jules and Jim''? Blake Edwards's remake of Mr. Truffaut's ''Man Who Loved Women''? Or ''Original Sin,'' Michael Cristofer's reworking of that same unlucky auteur's ''Mississippi Mermaid''? How about Jim McBride's ''Breathless,'' with Richard Gere standing in for Jean-Paul Belmondo in Mr. Godard's original? I didn't think so. You might recall, if only because it's relatively recent (2002), Adrian Lyne's aptly titled ''Unfaithful,'' which managed to turn Mr. Chabrol's extra-dry thriller ''La Femme Infidele'' into a conventionally steamy romantic melodrama; and you probably wish you didn't.
 Mr. Lyne, though, is the one director of that select group who was audacious -- or arrogant -- enough to take the extremely personal work of another (much stronger) filmmaker and to make it his own. ''Unfaithful'' may be ridiculous, but it's unmistakably an Adrian Lyne film, not a nervous, tentative homage to a Chabrol classic. And maybe that's the best anyone can hope for from these unholy alliances between New Wave auteurs and Hollywood players: a movie that dares, with all the courage of utterly unwarranted conviction, to be itself.
 Hence Viagra -- which is, come to think of it, a fair metaphor for the way Chris Rock pumps up the 35-year-old, French-speaking, philosophy-musing, turtleneck-wearing material of ''Chloe in the Afternoon.'' He treats Mr. Rohmer's original as a sitcom that needs a little more com and a lot less sit. Mr. Rohmer is so economical that he declines to provide, among other details he deems irrelevant, an establishing shot of the central couple's suburban home or a clear sense of what Alexandre actually does for a living; none of his three main characters appear to have anything like a friend. 
 ''I Think I Love My Wife'' fills in those gaps. Because no American comedy can function without the participation of a best friend-confidant, Steve Buscemi has been pressed into service here. And just to be on the safe side Mr. Rock fills in a few other gaps, as well. What was once a rather austere triangle is now enhanced by a marriage counselor, a violent ex-boyfriend for Nikki, some four-letter words, a sprinkling of Rockian one-liners (many of them concerning Michael Jackson) and a significant across-the-board increase in double-takes, spluttering, and wide-eyed comic exasperation.
 Voila: a Chris Rock movie married to an Eric Rohmer movie. For better and for worse.

HEADLINE: A Time and Place for Grousing

BYLINE: By ELEANOR RANDOLPH

 BODY:
As a new correspondent in Moscow years ago, I was given the rule about complaints. You were allowed to complain only if three major things went wrong. When the water was only hot on one floor of the apartment building and only cold on the next floor (and the toilet in your flat had become a boiling cauldron), that amounted to one complaint. A headache, a flat tire, a long wait for bread -- those were zilch, routine irritations in the Soviet scheme of things. It turned out to be an important lesson for a pampered American in an un-pampered world. 
 In today's global economy, however, there is a totally different culture for complaints. Artful bellyaching has become a survival skill. And, the harder it becomes to complain (''You're talking to me from Tajikistan?'') and the longer it takes to get satisfaction, the angrier customers become in return.
American consumers are so angry that companies are assessing the new level of customer rage. A study by Arizona State University found that 70 per cent of customers who had problems were either extremely or very teed-off as a result of their complaints. Scott Broetzmann, president of Customer Care Measurement and Consulting, which helped with the university analysis, said, ''You have to go back more than 40 years (i.e., Ralph Nader's heyday) to find the acrimony you now have between consumers and businesses.''
 Although there are many companies that care deeply about customer service, too many consider the consumer complaints desk to be a cost center worthy of cutting. So, consumers are fighting back. Mr. Broetzmann, who helps businesses deal with consumer outrage, says that customers become angrier with every hour spent trying to get relief. (Four hours is the average.) But he also says that many consumers say they would be satisfied with respect or an apology rather than, for example, a replacement iPod. 
 For those who actually want a working product, there is a whine industry growing steadily on the Internet, a whole new universe for self-help complaining. Sites like The Consumerist celebrate when a company is fined for not serving customers quickly enough. And GetHuman focuses on how to get a human being on the phone. (If you're desperate, you can even get GetHuman on the phone.)
 Ron Burley, author of ''Unscrewed: The Consumer's Guide to Getting What You Paid For,'' argues that any complaint has to be a business transaction. Forget an apology. Forget what he calls the ''customer service cattle chute or voice mail jail.'' Instead, one must quietly and politely explain to a business representative that not resolving this legitimate complaint could affect the company's bottom line. Mr. Burley suggests such tactics as printing fliers about the complaint to hand out on the sidewalk unless the store makes good. Think Clint Eastwood, he advises.
 As a veteran of pent-up complaints from my Moscow years, I like thinking about Dale Carnegie. Mr. Carnegie is credited with saying that every dissatisfied customer generates 10 lost sales. That, of course, was before the Internet. ELEANOR RANDOLPH

HEADLINE: Reducing the Risk of Default

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
BECAUSE of new policies from Freddie Mac, some, if not many, of the millions of borrowers with poor credit could be shut out of home mortgages. But Freddie Mac also says that it is planning new mortgage products in an attempt to reduce the risk of default. 
 Freddie Mac, which buys loans from lenders and, in doing so, sets underwriting standards for many lenders, said late last month that it would stop buying certain ''2/28'' and ''3/27'' loans, or those on which interest rates are fixed for only the first two years or three years of a 30-year loan. The change was prompted by an increasing number of defaults on such loans because of rising rates and falling real estate prices. 
Interest rates on these loans can start in the 6 percent range but rise to their maximum rates of around 12 percent within four years.
 Freddie Mac said that in September, it would buy only those loans made to borrowers who proved they could pay the highest interest rates, not the initial rates. It also said that lenders would be required to be more careful in verifying incomes of applicants for such loans and that lenders would be strongly encouraged to collect tax and insurance payments and hold them in escrow accounts.
 ''It's a straightforward attempt to make sure the borrower can afford the payments,'' said Frank Nothaft, the chief economist for Freddie Mac.
 The 2/28 and 3/27 loans have been marketed heavily to subprime borrowers whose credit scores are so low they cannot qualify for mortgages with longer fixed-rate periods. Mr. Nothaft said that a typical subprime borrower, with a credit score of 550, might qualify for a 2/28 loan with a teaser rate of 5.9 percent. But interest rates on 2/28s rise more sharply than adjustable-rate mortgages given to prime borrowers. 
 Those with 2/28s may have their rates rise by three percentage points after two years, then another percentage point every six months thereafter. Borrowers could reach the typical lifetime interest rate cap of 11.9 percent within 42 months. 
 In contrast, prime borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages enjoy fixed rates for five or seven years, with interest rates raised at longer intervals after that.
 Freddie Mac said it would create ''model subprime mortgages'' for lenders to market. The new mortgages will include smaller ''margins,'' or incremental interest rate increases once the fixed-rate period ends, and longer intervals between those increases. They will also include longer fixed-rate periods. 
 The Federal National Mortgage Association, the government-backed company known as Fannie Mae, which has the same mission as Freddie Mac, would not comment directly on Freddie Mac's initiative. But it said it was developing new ''rescue mortgage'' products to help subprime borrowers in difficulty.
 The Mortgage Bankers Association criticized Freddie Mac's new standards. John M. Robbins, the group's chairman, said that the new policies would ''limit the product options and the access to credit for those individuals most in need, many of whom are first-time, underserved or minority home buyers.''
 But many minority and consumer advocates expressed support for the new standards, including the AARP, the N.A.A.C.P. and the Consumer Federation of America.
 Freddie Mac's new loan standards will not dictate lending methods all by themselves, since Fannie Mae has not joined in. Lenders who sell loans to hedge funds and other investors also need not follow suit. 
 Jeffrey Guarino, the managing director of Gotham Capital Mortgage, a broker based in New York, said the regulations would be felt most fully outside Manhattan, because Manhattan has fewer subprime borrowers. 
 The new policies ''are generally speaking smart,'' Mr. Guarino said, ''although with fewer people getting loans, that could lower housing prices.'' 
 Mr. Nothaft of Freddie Mac said that for subprime borrowers who keep current at the outset, ''odds are that your credit scores will have improved, too -- you might even qualify for a prime product.''

HEADLINE: A Family Feud That Is Familiar

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
A ''little problem'' between a stepson and a stepmother. A father's estrangement from his children. 
 Rudolph W. Giuliani found himself distracted in the midst of his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination by questions about skeletons in the closet of a messy divorce. He had to respond to remarks last week by his son, Andrew, 21, that, as a stepson, he had ''a little problem'' with Mr. Giuliani's wife, Judith Nathan, and had not until recently spoken to his father ''for a decent amount of time.''
Mr. Giuliani told reporters, who bombarded him with questions at a California event, ''It's the kind of thing that I think affects a lot of families these days.'' He also has a daughter, Caroline, 17, by his former wife Donna Hanover. 
 ''And I believe that these problems with blended families are challenges.'' 
 Mr. Giuliani may have been scrambling to right his campaign and preserve his presidential ambitions, but in speaking of the difficulties between his current wife and his children from a previous marriage he tapped into the struggles of millions of American families who have to regroup when a new marriage, or recoupling, follows a divorce or breakup. 
 The Census Bureau says more than 3.6 million American households, nearly 10 percent of all households with children under 18, are ''blended,'' meaning they include stepparents and stepsiblings or half siblings. The bureau says 15 percent of all children in the United States, or 10.6 million, live in these households. 
 But many call that figure conservative because it does not count children who have stepfamilies, but whose primary residence is with a biological parent who has no new partner. 
 Whatever the living circumstances, conflict is the norm rather than the exception, say stepfamilies and the psychotherapists who counsel them. High expectations, jealousies, divided loyalties, problems with the ex and lingering hurt often combine to turn blended households into battlegrounds and family members into fairy tale cliches: more Cinderella's twisted stepfamily than ''The Brady Bunch.'' 
 Blended families are the topic of scores of books, online chat groups and family therapists. 
 ''Sometimes families blend very easily, but that's rare,'' said Jeannette Lofas, the founder of the Stepfamily Foundation in New York. ''Generally what happens is that the kids reject the new stepparent, the stepparent gets mad at the stepchild, and there's a battle.'' 
 But scenarios are as varied as the circumstances surrounding falling in and out of love. 
 Lisa and Dave Brodeur, a Massachusetts couple, who married eight years ago, met at a children's basketball game while separated from their spouses. They say they instantly clicked. With four children between them, from 7 to the teens, Mr. Brodeur said he proposed marriage two years later, envisioning his own version of family bliss. 
 ''I thought this was going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread,'' he said. ''We'd be together, my daughter would have siblings and, economically, we would be better off.'' 
 Mrs. Brodeur, who is 40 and a special education paraprofessional at a preschool, said she saw a less rosy picture but ''I thought our love for each other would pull us together, which it has.'' 
 The Brodeurs are still married. But if they stitched together their clans -- her daughter, son and a stepson from a previous marriage and his daughter -- it was not without messy seams: rejection of the stepfather by Mrs. Brodeur's daughter, complaints of unequal parental treatment from some of the children, meddling and child support problems involving exes and disagreements over discipline. All of it put stress on the couple's relationship. 
 ''At times, it's been almost unbearable,'' Mrs. Brodeur said. ''You're always in the middle. My goal at one point was to make it through the day without any conflict.'' 
 Combining their families has been harder than either imagined, but the Brodeurs, who have three of the four children in college, say they managed because of perseverance, and with the help of professionals. 
 ''You need somebody to advise you,'' said Mr. Brodeur, 52, an office manager. ''People just don't realize what they're getting into.'' 
 The health of blended families hinges on how adept they are in navigating emotional landmines and in the success of the adults in being parents together, counselors said. It is possible to do better than struggling to survive, some therapists said. Some families thrive, and the rewards are many. Not least is bringing into the lives of children an adult who isn't a birth parent but who can love them and even be a positive influence on their lives. 
 For a stepparent, said Emily Bouchard, a stepmother and family coach in Washington State, who operates Blended-Families.com, an online service, ''the biggest reward is building a connection of their own with the stepchild, because it's a chosen love, not a required one.'' 
 But it takes years of hard work, Mrs. Bouchard and others said. It is estimated that the divorce rate for second marriages with children from a previous union is substantially higher than that for first marriages, which hovers between 40 and 50 percent, some studies suggest. 
 Every family member is prone to feelings that make the transition into a new family dynamic difficult right off the bat, said Ms. Lofas of the Stepfamily Foundation. The organization keeps a list of common complaints: 
 ''I want my old family back.'' (Child) 
 ''I come in to put some order in the place, and they all reject me.'' (Stepfather)
 ''Sometimes I think she's looking to find the worst in my kids.'' (Father)
 ''Everyone in his life -- his kids, his former wife and his business -- come before me.'' (Stepmother)
 ''I told the children that they don't have to listen to her.'' (Mother) 
 Some therapists note that it can take at least three years of turmoil before couples are even ready to join forces to tackle the strife. But the road to family harmony can be smoother, they say, if couples abide by general rules, like acknowledging feelings of loss, abandonment and anger; avoiding bad-mouthing the other parent or stepparent; and not expecting too much too soon. 
 ''Some people want to have a loving family, and it is very doable,'' Mrs. Bouchard said. ''What's unrealistic is to expect to be unified and loving immediately,'' 
 But some families face a tougher challenge than others. Those with teenagers, for example. Younger children are more adaptable. 
 Mr. Giuliani's case, some experts agreed, seems particularly tough because it comes with the considerable baggage of a public and bitter divorce. (Ms. Nathan is Mr. Giuliani's third wife. His first marriage, to his second cousin, Regina Peruggi, was annulled.) The fallout from the divorce -- highlighted by Mr. Giuliani's open courtship of Ms. Nathan while still married to Ms. Hanover and Ms. Hanover's accusations at a news conference that Mr. Giuliani, then the mayor of New York, had engaged in adultery even before his relationship with Ms. Nathan -- seemed evident in Andrew Giuliani's statements to the press, including telling ABC in an interview, ''I got my values from my mother.'' 
 FAMILY therapists said complications like adultery can fuel anger, which may surface in future family relations. It is not unusual for children to side with one parent. 
 ''For the kids there are so many factors that affect how they accept a second relationship, but there's a lot of loyalty guilt,'' said Susan M. Davis, a clinical social worker in Los Angeles, who specializes in stepfamilies. 
 One of Mrs. Bouchard's stepdaughters, Robin Bouchard, 25, said teenagers have a sense of ownership not only about parents, but also about their home. She said she was 15 and living with her father when her stepmother came into the picture. 
 ''One time she put her name on a half-eaten yogurt, and I was so outraged,'' the stepdaughter said. ''I made a smoothie with it. How dare she label something in my refrigerator? It was because she had a cold, and she didn't want anyone else to get her cold.'' 
 In more successful experiences, expectations and reality coincide. Kathy Volpe, 48, said she always wanted to be a mother and had her chance when she married her husband, Chris, 42, who had primary custody of his daughter, now 8. 
 Mrs. Volpe said she assumed the day-to-day care of her stepdaughter, Sophie, but has been mindful never to convey the impression that she is taking the birth mother's place. 
 ''Respect is our saving grace,'' Mrs. Volpe said. 
 Mr. Volpe, an information technology business analyst in Ohio, said the family has had its share of conflicts over visitation and child-rearing, but he says everyone, including his former wife, is clear about roles. 
 ''It's both parents' responsibility to help maintain relationships as much as they can be maintained,'' he said. ''Parts of your family can coexist very nicely.'' 
 His daughter has her own take on the family. Mrs. Volpe said she insists on calling both mother and stepmother the same: ''Mom.''

HEADLINE: Another Warning on Warming

 BODY:
If President Bush requires any more proof that he sits on the wrong side of the global warming debate, he should listen to his own scientists. An internal draft of a report the administration will soon forward to the United Nations shows that his program of voluntary reductions has done little to stop the rise in greenhouse gases generated in this country. 
 There is no sign that this report will alter Mr. Bush's thinking; he contemptuously dismissed a similar report five years ago as bureaucratic boilerplate. But we are hopeful that it will add momentum to the bills circulating in Congress that would impose mandatory limits on these gases, a course Mr. Bush has opposed since renouncing his own 2000 campaign pledge to do just that.
The document -- a distillation of expert views in various federal agencies -- will show that Mr. Bush is making modest progress towards his goal of making sure that emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases grow at a slower rate than the economy. But it will also show that in absolute terms, emissions will grow nearly as fast in the next decade as they did in the last, when they increased by 11.6 percent. This is not much better than business as usual. And as national policy it is clearly unacceptable. 
 The carbon lodged in the atmosphere since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution has already taken a toll -- disappearing glaciers, increasingly acidic oceans. The report predicts even graver consequences to come, including severe and persistent droughts in the Western United States. Essentially a scientific document, the report will not recommend new directions in policy. But its clear message is that stopping and then reversing these emissions is the only way to avert real trouble. 
 As Congress is beginning to realize, that will require a program of carbon controls at home and a good deal of persuasion and technological change abroad, especially in China, which will soon overtake the United States as the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gases.
 This page has long lamented that Mr. Bush seems perfectly happy bringing up the rear of a parade he ought to be leading. His lack of leadership is all the more noticeable now that so many prominent figures in government and business have joined in. 
 In January, 10 major corporations announced their support of a mandatory limit on emissions. Two regional agreements to cap greenhouse gases -- agreements developed in part by Republican governors -- are nearing completion. And Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, has urged the relevant House committees to produce a bill by the summer.
 Mr. Bush changed his mind once on carbon emissions. He should change it again. The world will thank him for doing so.

BYLINE: By HORACIO SILVA

 BODY:
When the lights came on at the Dolce & Gabbana spring show, the scene resembled a cattle call in Sparta. ''The classical Greek aesthetic is a strong influence in men's fashion,'' Domenico Dolce says. ''We were definitely inspired by the spirit of the ancient Olympics, of a healthy mind and body -- a mental and sensual freedom.'' 
Dolce and his partner, Stefano Gabbana, aren't the only ones going mental over muscles. After seasons of skinny-nerd ubiquity, the heroic hard bods at Dsquared, Jean Paul Gaultier and Y-3 suggest that the Greeks may soon be beating up on the geeks. 
 If anyone embodied the neo-Hellenism that is muscling its way back into the fashion arena, it was Herb Ritts. 
 More than any other photographer of his generation, Ritts, who died in 2002 at the age of 50, redefined masculine glamour with his traditionalist images of modern-day Adonises, whose hypertonic physiques -- Apollonian articulation made flesh -- he adoringly mythologized. 
 In his shoots for fashion-forward European magazines like Per Lui and L'Uomo Vogue, in his advertising work for Calvin Klein underwear and for Valentino, and in his widely published celebrity portraiture, Ritts captured his often nude male sitters between nature and the sublime. 
 As the last of the classicists, working in the stylized tradition of George Platt Lynes and Horst P. Horst, Ritts was essentially conservative. His most radical legacy is having seduced a heterosexual public with soft-core homoerotica. ''He made it palatable and artful,'' says Vince Aletti, a photography critic at the New Yorker, ''and he allowed people to see its direct connection to classical art, by which I mean shorthand for Greek and simple -- a beautiful body, a classic white background and a graphically elegant composition.''
 Although at times he appeared to channel the entire pantheon of fashion photography, Ritts was in fact self-taught. He grew up in an upper-middle-class suburb of Los Angeles, near the Hollywood beau monde that he would later immortalize. (As a kid, his next-door neighbor was the Platonic tough guy Steve McQueen.) After studying economics at Bard College in New York, Ritts moved back to the West Coast; his break came in 1978 when he photographed his tenant, the proto male supermodel Matt Collins, for Italian Harper's Bazaar. 
 From the beginning of the '80s, when he shot Olivia Newton-John for the cover of her ''Physical'' album, Ritts worshiped at the shrine of aerobicized California. When youth culture reached its apotheosis on MTV, Ritts started to direct music videos, pairing Madonna with hunky mermen for the video of her 1989 single ''Cherish.'' Although his career was short, Ritts was prolific -- he exhibited frequently and released several books. Ultimately, however, Ritts's bequest is more insidious: it's evident every time a buff god is used to sell anything from bedsheets to phone minutes, and now every time a fashionably carefree Apollo goes into battle in skimpy shorts and an oversize man bag.

HEADLINE: In the Daily Shuffle, Rail and Bus Ridership Rises

BYLINE: By JEFF HOLTZ

 BODY:
The number of people using public transportation in the state increased by about 2.7 million, or 4 percent, last year.
 The largest increase was on buses, where ridership rose by 1.64 million over 2005, according to the State Department of Transportation's annual report on bus and rail ridership, released earlier this month. Ridership increased by more than one million on Metro-North Railroad and by 35,000 on the Shore Line East Railroad.
Gov. M. Jodi Rell attributed the increases to the availability of jobs in some areas, refurbished rail cars on the Shore Line East commuter railroad and the high cost of gas. 
 The more people used public transportation, Mrs. Rell said, the better for the state's economy. ''That's the best way to unclog our highways and parkways,'' she said. ''It's making the state a better place to do business.''
 Ralph J. Carpenter, the transportation commissioner, credited Mrs. Rell and the Legislature for supporting public transportation programs over the last two years.
 The report said that 51 percent of the riders on Metro-North last year were boarding trains in Manhattan and traveling into the state or traveling within the state.
 Floyd Lapp, executive director of the South Western Regional Planning Agency, which represents several cities and towns in lower Fairfield County, said Stamford and Norwalk had benefited from commuters from New York. He said he believed the numbers were part of an upward trend.
 ''It's reached a point, given the levels of congestion of the roads, that the message is finally getting through: that despite rising commuter fares, mass transit is the way to go,'' he said.Land Trust Official Draws Service in Marijuana Case 
 The president of the Litchfield Land Trust has agreed to take part in a pretrial program that requires him to serve more than 200 hours of community service after being arrested with marijuana on the trust's property last year.
 Nathan P. Litwin, 30, who is also a lawyer in Litchfield, agreed to the program last month, and will report to Superior Court in Bantam on Feb. 28, 2008, as part of the agreement, according to David Shepack, the state's attorney for the Litchfield judicial district. Of the 212 hours that he is to serve, Mr. Litwin was given 100 of those for misconduct because he is a lawyer, Mr. Shepack said. 
 Mr. Litwin, reached by phone, said he had no comment.
 ''Justice was served, and we can all move on now,'' said Clifford A. Cooper, the vice president of the Litchfield Land Trust.
 In September, the state police charged Mr. Litwin and another man, Joshua P. Barbero, 30, of Goshen, with possession of marijuana and conspiracy to possess marijuana the day after about 20 six-foot-tall marijuana plants weighing approximately 100 pounds were removed from the trust's largest preserve at Prospect Mountain between Bantam and Milton. The two men were carrying pieces of the plants that had fallen to the ground during their removal, the police said. 
 At the time of the arrests, Mr. Cooper said that Mr. Litwin told him he had not planted the marijuana.
 Mr. Barbero agreed to the same pretrial program as Mr. Litwin, but he serves 112 hours of community service. He also is scheduled to return to court next February as part of the agreement.
 The Litchfield Land Trust is a nonprofit, member-supported group established in 1968 to preserve open space. It owns 900 acres in Litchfield and holds conservation easements on another 1,200 acres in the town.

HEADLINE: Medicaid Costs Can Be in Eye Of the Crusader

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
In the escalating public battle over his budget cuts, Gov. Eliot Spitzer has offered several critiques of the state's vast health care system, some unquestionably true, and some subtle and complex.
 But the messages from the governor that have resonated loudest are contentious, simple and blunt: First, that Medicaid spending, already too high, is rising dangerously fast; and second, that the blame lies primarily with the hospital and nursing home industry, and a powerful union of health care workers.
A close look, however, at the state's $46 billion-a-year Medicaid program, which serves more than 4 million low-income patients, casts doubt on both of those ideas. 
 Mr. Spitzer's proposals, and his strong statements, have put him at odds with the industry, state legislators and members of Congress from both parties. But a governor who promises to tame a profligate and dysfunctional system may well have anticipated that he would find himself politically isolated, and that the isolation would burnish his crusading public image. 
 The Spitzer administration makes a compelling argument that Medicaid spending, by far the largest part of the state's budget, costs far too much, and limits the state's ability to pay for other things, like schools. 
 New York spends much more than any other state on Medicaid, its hospitals are inefficient by many measures, and large amounts of money are given to hospitals based on formulas and political deals made decades ago that seem no longer to make sense. 
 The health industry and the union, 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, make compelling counter-arguments that costs are not really rising and that the system cannot absorb an abrupt cut of $1.3 billion a year without harm to patients' care. 
 Medicaid costs vastly more in New York than elsewhere, and spending has grown sharply in this decade, about 40 percent from 2000 to 2005, the most recent year for which figures are available. But the number of patients in the program has grown even faster, by about 55 percent -- growth that Mr. Spitzer endorses and wants to build on.
 In that period, Medicaid spending per patient fell 9 percent in New York, even as it rose 17 percent nationally. New York used to spend almost twice as much per recipient as the national average, but that gap has narrowed by almost half.
 Aides to the governor say that is largely because of the creation of a new class of Medicaid, Family Health Plus, whose more than 500,000 clients are generally healthier than other Medicaid patients, and cost less to care for. 
 Even taking them out of the equation, however, the cost per patient has grown less than the rate of inflation since 2000, and less than it has around the country.
 ''That's like saying I have a car that costs $1,000 a day to operate, and isn't it great gas went down 5 cents,'' said Dennis P. Whalen, the governor's chief health care adviser. ''The fact is, you still started at a place that's way out of whack. By any measure that you choose, our program is the most expensive in the nation. It's sort of de facto out of control.'' 
 But that is not what the governor has said, or how he has said it. 
 In his budget address in January, he called Medicaid ''the one program that's become, and rightly so, the evidence of spiraling and unwieldy spending,'' driven by interest groups. that get their way ''through a combination of persuasive argument, political strength and effective presence here in Albany.'' He said hospitals and nursing homes ''have received almost an unending supply of capital and cash.''
 Dennis Rivera, the influential president of 1199, reacted angrily, saying the governor was ''making us the villains.'' 
 Payments to hospitals account for the biggest piece of Medicaid, almost $12 billion a year. But since 2000, those payments have risen no faster than Medicaid costs overall, and since 2003 they have been essentially flat. Spending on nursing homes, about $7 billion, grew much more slowly than did the program as a whole. 
 Other parts of Medicaid -- prescription drugs, in-home care, doctors' fees and administrative costs, to name a few -- have grown much faster.
 Daniel Sisto, president of the Healthcare Association of New York, a group that lobbies for hospitals and nursing homes, said the state was largely responsible for increased costs because it had made more people eligible for Medicaid, offered new services and decided to pay more for other services, like dentistry. 
 ''They've made the commitments and then decided who to blame as the culprits,'' he said. ''Hospitals and nursing homes make easier targets as institutions than having to deal with adjusting one's promises.''
 Kenneth E. Raske, president of the other major industry group, the Greater New York Hospital Association, argued that big Medicaid spending can be seen as a good thing, because half of that money is paid by the federal government. 
 He said an economy that relied more heavily on private insurance would be getting less help from Washington. 
 Spitzer administration officials note that hospitals and nursing homes account for less than half of the governor's proposed health care cuts (the industry says the proportion is somewhat higher). 
 They add that he is also looking for savings from insurance and drug companies. But the governor rarely mentions those elements of his cost containment plan. 
 Instead, Mr. Spitzer, in his speeches, makes repeated references to a political deal made five years ago, which he casts as emblematic of a system in need of reform.
 In early 2002, facing big budget deficits, the state expected a one-time, $1 billion windfall from allowing Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield to become a for-profit company. In hurried, secret negotiations, with almost no chance for dissenters or other interest groups to weigh in, the union and the hospitals persuaded lawmakers to give most of that money to them, to pay for workers' raises. 
 Mr. Spitzer has assailed that deal, drawing heated objections from 1199 and its president, Dennis Rivera -- one of several examples in this fight of confrontational words drawing an equally combative response. 
 Indeed, the war of words has often seemed out of proportion to a set of budget proposals that are not much different from those Gov. George E. Pataki, Mr. Spitzer's predecessor, used to propose, which were negotiated at much lower volume. 
 Beyond any specific claims or proposals, Mr. Spitzer is making a statement, signaling to his antagonists and to the public that he fears no one and will not do business as it was done before.

HEADLINE: Clinton Vows Middle Class Will Not Be 'Invisible' to Her

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H., March 10 

 BODY:
Echoing her husband's 1992 presidential campaign message about the ''forgotten middle class,'' Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton accused the Bush administration on Saturday night of turning the middle class and working families into ''invisible Americans'' whose needs have gone ignored for the last six years.
 Speaking before 1,000 New Hampshire Democrats, Mrs. Clinton invoked another past Democratic presidential candidate as well, John F. Kennedy, as she noted that some Americans are skeptical that a woman can win the presidency in 2008. 
''A lot of people said back then, 'Well, you know, America will never elect a Catholic as president,' '' she said. As for her own candidacy, she used a line that has become a trademark in her seven-week-old campaign: ''We'll never know unless we try.''
 Mrs. Clinton, who refers to her bid as being ''in it to win it,'' also sounded a more explicit note of confidence in herself as the most prepared and battle-tested contender for the Democratic nomination, even as she complimented her rivals as ''great, great candidates.''
 ''I'm ready -- I'm ready to run against the Republicans and win, and I'm ready to govern and lead our country into the future,'' she said.
 It was one of the widest-ranging speeches that Mrs. Clinton has delivered this winter, and it reflected several trends in her campaign: Presenting herself as the most experienced, confident candidate in the field; tapping her husband's ideas and personal popularity; and portraying her candidacy as historic and inspiring for women and girls.
 Ranging across topics, she repeated her call to start withdrawing troops from Iraq now, urged the government to listen to scientists concerned about global warming, and recalled the moral authority of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in combating poverty and inequality.
 She also praised Americans' optimism and associated herself with the spirit -- a quality that voters tend to like in their presidents. In that vein, she made clear that she would push back forcefully against critics of the United States and anyone who questioned the nation's resolve.
 ''It is always a mistake to bet against America,'' she said. ''We are not the world's oldest democracy by accident.''
 Her remarks about ''invisible Americans'' stood out as the new flourish to her standard campaign stump speech, and she cast a wide net: Rather than focus on the middle class or the working class, she included both, and singled out single mothers, children in poorly performing schools, Sept. 11 first responders, and soldiers returning from combat with disabilities, among others.
 ''If you are a hard-working single parent who can't afford health insurance or a small business owner who worries about energy costs or a student who can't afford to continue college, you are invisible to this administration,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''For six long years, President Bush and the Washington Republicans have looked right through you.
 ''Well, they're not invisible to us,'' she said, prompting some of her strongest applause of the night. ''They're certainly not invisible to me. And when we retake the White House, they will no longer be invisible to the president of the United States.''
 The divide between the haves and have-nots was a popular theme of Mrs. Clinton's husband, Bill, as a candidate for president in 1992. He spoke frequently about the ''forgotten middle class,'' and drew some of his strongest cheers when he noted that the top 1 percent of families had netted 60 percent of the economic gains during the 1980s and had accumulated more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.
 Mrs. Clinton made an explicit nod to another campaign theme of her husband's, saying, ''We no longer have a president who puts people first; we don't even have a president who puts the future first.''
 Former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina hit on similar ideas during his 2004 campaign for president, focusing on the gaps between ''the two Americas,'' and has continued pressing the theme in his race against Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination.
 Mrs. Clinton spoke at the New Hampshire Democratic Party's annual 100 Club fund-raising dinner. About 1,000 tickets were sold, a few hundred more than usual, and people waited in long lines for a seat at the event at the Sheraton Nashua Hotel.

HEADLINE: On the Road With Bush and Chavez

BYLINE: By Fernando Baez. 
Fernando Baez is the author of the forthcoming book ''A Universal History of the Destruction of Books: From Ancient Sumer to Modern-Day Iraq.'' This article was translated by Kristina Cordero from the Spanish.

DATELINE: Caracas, Venezuela 

 BODY:
WHEN I was a little boy in San Felix de Guayana, a Venezuelan village on the banks of the Orinoco, the doctors who worked in the poorest communities were from the United States. My father, an honest lawyer who was unemployed his entire life, felt a genuine sense of pride in the United States, and in time, he transmitted this pride to me. One of the first books he ever gave me, covered in an olive-green dust jacket and stamped with gold-foil letters, was an illustrated biography of John F. Kennedy, his personal hero. 
 All of this feels like nostalgia now. Today, the doctors in my hometown are Cuban. 
One of the most significant battles to determine future relations between the United States and Latin America is being waged at this very moment, under a cloud of old antagonisms and with pitfalls lurking at every turn. President Bush's Latin American tour -- he is scheduled to visit Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico before returning home on Wednesday -- is a diplomatic counterattack, clearly aimed at the growing influence of Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez. 
 The ultimate goal of this tour is to create an alliance that would give Brazil, the world's 10th-largest economy, a key, if restrained, regional and global role. Supported by the four other nations Mr. Bush is visiting, Brazil would balance Mr. Chavez's growing radical influence.
 Here in Caracas, the debate is intense and never-ending when it comes to this peculiar struggle for control over the economies and the sources of energy in the hemisphere. I must confess that I share the skepticism of the many Venezuelans who do not believe that any real changes or diplomatic miracles will take place in the region. 
 In the streets and cafes, Mr. Chavez's supporters repeatedly invoke Simon Bolivar's phrases about imperialism. But this is not the scared, defensive rhetoric of the days when America was seen as an unstoppable force. Rather, the tone is usually one of exasperation. 
 Unfortunately, I think Mr. Bush's efforts to turn this tide are too late. All the last-minute gestures of good will -- like the pledge last week of $385 million to help underwrite mortgages for working families in the region and to send a Navy hospital ship, the Comfort, on a tour of 12 ports -- are simply not enough to take back the aimless, lost years that have passed us by. 
 Time is the one thing that the current White House administration has most flagrantly wasted, and given the electoral campaign that looms on the horizon, the Republicans' rush to reactivate the dialogue with Latin America isn't seen as a step forward in the development of constructive policies. On the contrary, the visit seems to underscore an ever-growing discrepancy between American desires and those of the leftist movement championed by Venezuela along with Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua.
 Anti-American sentiment, always strong in Latin America, has only grown more acute in recent times, largely because Washington has treated us with indifference and disrespect since 9/11. The American obsession with the Middle East undermined whatever basis there was for a sustained continental integration. Money once spent on foreign aid programs that not only fought drug trafficking but also supported education and social justice has been diverted to the war on terrorism. 
 President Bush has arrived in a region with some 570 million inhabitants, of whom at least 40 percent are living in poverty and 50 million subsist on less than a dollar a day. There are more than 30 million indigenous people, a forgotten population that represents perhaps 80 percent of the most desperately impoverished even though many of them are members of tribes and residents of villages that share their lands with oil and mining companies.
 Will Mr. Bush help to change this? Poor people believe that someone who builds a wall along the border with Mexico is not the kind of person who has faith in the benefits of free trade agreements.
 Hugo Chavez also went on tour last week, holding a rally in Buenos Aires at the same time Mr. Bush was just across the Rio de la Plata in Montevideo, Uruguay. The event was planned by Argentina's president, Nestor Kirchner, and was clearly intended to signal that American efforts to form a friendly bloc in Latin America will be countered by Mr. Chavez's radical networking. 
 In the papers and on TV here, there is lively debate over the reasons for Mr. Chavez's trip, and over the wisdom of his trying to pre-empt Mr. Bush. But I expect Mr. Chavez will come out on top -- his great talent is adapting to circumstances quickly and reading the crowd, two things American policy makers in Latin America have never been good at. 
 The rival visits were fitting, as Mr. Chavez was the furtive impulse behind Mr. Bush's tour. The American strategy is about seeming to pay attention, not about overcoming the tunnel vision that has characterized the Bush State Department's view of Latin America. For this, and for so many other reasons, I count myself among those who have resigned themselves to another lost opportunity, another failure to effect real change.

HEADLINE: How Safe Is My Home?

BYLINE: By TERI KARUSH ROGERS

 BODY:
BY now it is no longer news that people are jiggling the planet's thermostat. 
 One response is to go green: New Yorkers who were terrified into action by Al Gore's movie, ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' are shaping up their lives and homes with a compulsion formerly reserved for the Atkins diet.
All this carbon cutting is a boon, and it certainly provides a moral high ground. But it fails to address one pesky truth: no matter how green New York City becomes, it remains hostage to huge amounts of heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions already in the pipeline and from the future environmental transgressions of others, facts made clear in the bleak conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released last month in Paris. 
 With no obvious savior in the wings, there is a growing urgency that global warming be understood at a local level, right down to the block, starting with: How could a rising sea level and pummeling storms affect the trillion dollars' worth of property New Yorkers call home? 
 ''It's all pointing in a bad direction,'' said Stuart Gaffin, an associate research scientist at the Center for Climate Systems Research at Columbia University. ''There's nothing good to encourage you to think we're going to avoid long-term flooding events.''
 Estimates provided by the center, and relied upon by New York City planners, predict that sea levels will creep up about five more inches by 2030 and another few inches by 2050. More dire estimates call for 12 inches or more between 2030 and 2080. 
 But while widespread permanent inundation -- the sort vividly illustrated in Mr. Gore's movie -- is possible, it isn't likely to occur in the city in our grandchildren's lifetimes, or even their grandchildren's. And an extra 5 to 10 inches of water over the next few decades won't pose devastating problems for most of the city.
 The bigger threat to property is the possibility of more frequent and increasingly vicious storms that could propel already encroaching waters onto the shore, could dump larger amounts of precipitation, and could lash glassy skyscrapers and crumbling tenements. 
 And even before that happens, real estate values in low-lying areas could erode as heightened awareness of global warming draws attention not only to long-term exposure to storms but also to near-term damage from severe storms that could happen regardless of any long-term warming trend -- like the major hurricane that experts say is overdue in New York City. 
 One Manhattan real estate agent said the fear was already weighing on some clients' minds. ''After Katrina, they saw how ineffective the U.S. is at holding back water compared to some other places, and it has made some people concerned,'' said the agent, Tom Hemann of Brown Harris Stevens, who sells downtown. He said last month's gloomy report on global warming prompted four former clients who had bought downtown to voice concern about living in low-lying neighborhoods. 
 Mr. Hemann -- who said he was confident that there would be solutions before there was real trouble -- is nevertheless working with a couple in their 30s who are selling their loft on Elizabeth Street. They had planned to buy again in Lower Manhattan, but the February report ''changed everything,'' Mr. Hemann said. ''Now they're telling us that one of the main considerations is to make sure it's not an area of low ground. They're also considering getting a smaller place here and investing in a property in a city way above sea level.''
 Most urban planning and environmental groups have just begun grappling with how to protect the city's property from climate change. Last fall, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg created the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability and named as its director Rohit Aggarwala, a 35-year-old former McKinsey & Company consultant with four degrees from Columbia. 
 As part of the new office's broad mandate to address housing, transportation and other infrastructure needs over the next 25 years, it will coordinate the development of a climate adaptation strategy.
 Drawing on other city agencies, including the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Buildings, the new long-term planning office has also met with more than 100 advocacy organizations, conducted community meetings in each borough and digested thousands of individual e-mail messages collected through its Web site, nyc.gov/planyc2030. 
 The early fruit of these efforts will be a plan -- or at least a framework for one, to be announced by the mayor in early April -- to tailor the city to its future 25 years hence.
 But like Mr. Hemann's clients, some New Yorkers are not willing to bet their nest eggs that the dice will roll their way.
 Among insurers, all of whom factor climate change into their risk assessments, some like Allstate are already refusing to renew homeowners' policies in the eight downstate counties (including metropolitan New York) most vulnerable to hurricanes and other major storms that could proliferate in a warming climate. (Allstate continues to insure individual co-op and condo units.) 
 ''When you have trillion-dollar exposure, it doesn't take much bad weather to cause extensive damage,'' said L. James Valverde Jr., the vice president for economics and risk management at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group based in Manhattan. ''That's really on the mind of the industry. When you've got this kind of concentration of people and property in a very important sector of the country, the potential for economic and insured loss really is great.''
 Structures at particular risk from storm-related flooding include tenements, brownstones and any building with old masonry foundations, said Joe Tortorella, a vice president and a structural engineer at Robert Silman Associates in Manhattan and a member of the Disaster Preparedness Task Force of the American Institute of Architects. 
 Mr. Tortorella noted that much of the West Village and Lower Manhattan -- neighborhoods whose low elevation renders them vulnerable to flooding -- is on a precarious perch. ''It's like the finest sand you can find, so that even if you could put it on a table, you can't mound it up in a pile,'' he said. 
 In a hurricane or severe northeaster, Mr. Tortorella said, ''if the water moves fast enough and recedes fast enough, there could be scouring like a tide that takes sand with it on the beach. As the water recedes, it pulls silt out and could undermine the building. It could be a disaster of epic proportions in New York for the smaller buildings.'' 
 Unlike New Orleans, where water from Hurricane Katrina was trapped in the city's tidal basin, a hurricane storm surge in New York City would most likely retreat after a single tidal cycle, except for the water pooled underground, where it could disable power lines, drown the subway system and choke basements, among other things. Standing water in basements could breed mold, rendering entire buildings uninhabitable. 
 And flooding isn't an issue just with hurricanes. Though climate models are at odds with one another, some scientists expect the number of northeasters to increase in the next several decades, along with the amount of rain they unleash. While the storms won't push rivers and oceans as far onto land as hurricanes could, northeasters cover more territory and linger far longer, over several tidal cycles. 
 In a city increasingly fashioned of glass, there are also winds to consider. Category 3 hurricanes generate sustained winds of 111 to 130 miles per hour, and Category 4 hurricanes blow at 131 to 155 m.p.h. But the city's building code requires that windows in even the newest buildings withstand winds of just 110 miles an hour. 
 ''Glass is a hot thing in New York City,'' Mr. Tortorella said. ''There's a lot of glass structures, and you get more aggressive with what you can do with glass -- actually using it for structure as opposed to just a skin on the building. The biggest problem with hurricanes is a 2-by-4 or signage from another building that falls off and blows through the glass and creates interior suction -- causing the windows to blow out, the walls to blow out.'' 
 Stronger windows could keep the winds at bay, but what about the water? 
 ''There's not going to be anything easy or cheap,'' said Mr. Gaffin of the climate research center at Columbia. ''There's not going to be a magic silver bullet.'' 
 One long-term but unappetizing option is to ring the city with enormous concrete sea walls. In Manhattan, this would require a wall several dozen feet high and wide enough to fit a four-lane highway on top. The higher a sea wall or levee is, the broader it has to be, and in New York City, which is interlaced with rivers, such barriers would encroach on some of the priciest real estate in the world.
 (In the Netherlands, in some otherwise picturesque villages guarded by sea walls, it is possible to hear the waves crashing, see the seagulls circling and smell the salt air but never see the ocean.)
 Somewhat more palatable though infinitely more complex and expensive -- and politically explosive, since some waterfront acreage would not be protected -- is the possibility of erecting a series of storm-surge barriers in local waterways. 
 ''What we're talking about is a ring of protection for metro New York that would require four large barriers, like removable dam structures, that could block off the ocean when needed,'' said Malcolm James Bowman, a professor of oceanography at the Marine Sciences Research Center at the State University at Stony Brook, N.Y., and the leader of the storm-surge group there that is studying ways to protect metropolitan New York and Long Island. 
 ''You'd need four,'' he said. ''One close under the Verrazano Bridge. One in Perth Amboy behind Staten Island, because the water would leak around the back into the harbor from the ocean. A third from Long Island Sound in the upper East River, perhaps between the Whitestone and Throgs Neck Bridges. And then to protect Jamaica Bay and Kennedy Airport, you would need a fourth one across the Rockaway Inlet, but because the ground is low there, you would also need a sea wall running along the beach and up around Kennedy Airport.''
 Such barriers, including lock systems to allow ships to pass through, would cost perhaps $10 billion each and take 5 to 10 years to construct. And that's not including the 30- or 40-year prelude of engineering studies, debate, financing and court challenges. 
 ''If you look at the European experience,'' said Professor Bowman, referring to surge barriers built or under construction in the Netherlands, London and Venice, ''it took up to 45 years in some cases, after a major catastrophe, before the barriers were built.'' 
 Not that the surge barriers would be a panacea. Besides the ecological side effects like erosion, the barriers wouldn't prevent wind damage and would fail to protect some areas, including the southern coast of Long Island. (There, said Professor Bowman, looking several decades ahead, ''I think people will stay as long as they can and then slowly evacuate if it gets really bad.'')
 Shorter-term fixes include mandating a costly round of retrofitting, intelligent land-use planning and reining in coastal development, or at least requiring wider buffer areas to absorb huge storm surges capped by breaking waves. 
 And then there's the building code.
 Even the city's newest gleaming towers were constructed under 40-year-old rules whose own foundations seem rickety when it comes to withstanding -- or even contemplating -- damage from severe storms. 
 With regard to flooding, the building code follows Federal Emergency Management Agency regulations, which set forth a bare-minimum standard for construction in flood zones and rely on the emergency agency's conservative flood maps drawn in 1983. Roughly translated, the maps identify areas that might be flooded by a Category 2 or 3 hurricane; in some places around New York City, the zones correspond to a mere Category 1 hurricane, with winds of 74 to 95 m.p.h. 
 Besides excluding areas that could be inundated by a severe hurricane, the flood zones are based on purely historical data and thus do not factor in climate change. That means that new construction may be inadequate to withstand the rigors of climate change 30, 40 or 50 years from now or the hurricane that could hit at any time. 
 Even the emergency agency's newest maps, scheduled to go into use this fall -- which show slightly enlarged flood zones on the south shores of Staten Island and Queens, for example; along the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan; and in Hunts Point in the Bronx -- are still based only on historical data. (The new maps can be viewed online on the Buildings Department Web site: gis.nyc.gov/dob/fm/index.htm.) 
 ''The future is just too theoretical, and FEMA maps have to tell people what has happened in the past,'' said Paul Weberg, a senior engineer in the agency's office that covers New York State. ''We need something to hang our hat on.'' 
 (Mr. Weberg himself made sure to buy a home in one of the highest neighborhoods on Staten Island. ''As much as I like the water, I wasn't going to buy a place south of Hylan Boulevard,'' he said, referring to the island's southern coastline.)
 For New York planners, there are other options. ''If there is a concern within a city or state about long-range planning or global warming,'' Mr. Weberg said, ''they can always go above our regulations. We go by minimum regulations. We are almost a compromise between environmentalists and builders.''
 The city's Buildings Department has been working to modernize its code for the last three years and expects to present a plan this spring.
 One section will revise the criteria for deciding how much force a window should withstand. With regard to flooding, the focus will be on shoring up a small group of critical buildings -- hospitals, firehouses and the like -- and only those built within identified flood zones. 
 But if you believe that flood zones will expand along with the frequency of storms, these zones will be inadequate. 
 So who's looking out for the rest of the city?
 ''I do a lot of work in the West Village in new construction, and the talk of storm surges is not even on the lips of anyone,'' Mr. Tortorella said. ''What's in the code is flood zones that you have to obey, and you deal with that but nothing more.''
 Homeowners curious about how vulnerable they are to flooding may not find even the newest FEMA maps especially useful. Besides failing to anticipate the effects of climate change, the flood zones merely calculate odds (again, based on historical data) that a particular area will be flooded. So while it may not seem very alarming that your home (or prospective home) is in a 100-year flood zone, the designation does not mean a flood will occur only once in 100 years. Instead, it means that a flood has a 26 percent chance of occurring in any 30-year period. 
 An arguably more useful gauge is the hurricane evacuation map that can be downloaded at the city's Office of Emergency Management Web site, nyc.gov/html/oem/html/ready/hurricane--guide.shtml. 
 Dispensing with probabilities, it illustrates the areas expected to be affected by hurricane storm surges based on today's sea levels -- block by block and neighborhood by neighborhood. The agency itself takes the threat quite seriously: it not only redrew its disaster plan after Katrina, but will soon solicit designs for an urban alternative to the FEMA trailer -- pods to shelter thousands of New Yorkers displaced by a disaster.
 Along with global-warming talk, the hurricane map has surfaced often enough in the media to make at least some home buyers and owners aware of the potential risk. But if Lower Manhattan is an example, most people even in low-lying areas aren't thinking about it too much.
 Paddington M. Zwigard, an avid environmentalist and a downtown real estate broker with Brown Harris Stevens, just sold her $4.15 million ''green'' penthouse on Chambers Street between Hudson and Greenwich Streets. Though she was long aware that its location near the river made it vulnerable to flooding -- either from a hurricane or a long-term rise in sea levels -- she was willing to stomach the risk to live downtown and near the river. 
 When she decided to sell, she thought the apartment's location would prompt at least some questions from buyers, though when it didn't, she suspected she knew why. 
 ''I've lived downtown for 20 years, and there's definitely a new wave of TriBeCans -- younger, self-absorbed, mass-materialist consumers who are really not aware of anything outside their whatever,'' Ms. Zwigard said. 
 She speculates that the extensive condo development has attracted a certain type of buyer: wealthier, more mobile and disinclined to look more than a few years into his or her homeowning future. Ms. Zwigard is planning to buy other apartments downtown, renovate them and sell them -- betting, in effect, on others' short-sightedness.
 Wayne Tusa, a former board member of the New York chapter of the United States Green Building Council, echoed that thought. ''People generally think about what's in their face today,'' he said. ''You're not thinking: 'Gee whiz, what will happen 30 years from now? Will the value suddenly go poof because my basement is flooded three times a week?' '' 
 Mr. Tusa, who lives at the edge of a 100-year flood plain, on East 90th Street between First and Second Avenues, is looking for a parking garage on higher ground. He is also considering buying a second home in the Catskills to get away from the coast.
 One downtown broker, Jon Phillips, a vice president of Halstead Property, said his buyers don't worry because they reason that ''the safest place to hide is in a bank.'' In other words, with so much capital at risk, if New York City flounders, they believe somebody will do something before it's too late.
 What if somebody doesn't? Is New York one catastrophic hurricane -- or a few awful northeasters -- away from a huge shift in ownership?
 ''There are several horror stories to be written,'' Mr. Tusa said.
 ''How does New York City survive if 20 percent of it is flooded and nothing works? What if we lose one airport, or what if the subway system doesn't work anymore? What if the waste-water treatment systems don't work anymore? What if 50 percent of the time there's waves on the F.D.R.? New York City would not be habitable --that's really the worst-case scenario. And before that begins to happen, people will make different choices like, 'Should I move my office?' ''
 But some thoughtful voices are being heard. ''The fact that the city has started raising the question now is to their credit,'' said Mark E. Ginsberg, a partner in Curtis & Ginsberg Architects in Manhattan and a leader of New York New Visions, a coalition of architecture, planning and design organizations concerned with rebuilding Lower Manhattan. ''Do we deal with it before something bad happens, or as is often the case in human nature, do we deal with it after something bad happens? Look what happened to New Orleans.''Insuring Against Floods
 MOST homeowners whose houses are within a flood zone designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency know it, because they are required to buy flood insurance to get a mortgage. But a major storm could inundate outlying areas, too -- either as a result of tidal surges or backups of sewage and drainage systems. Unfortunately, standard homeowner and co-op and condo policies exclude flood damage from storms. 
 Houses within the federally designated flood zones can be insured through the federal flood insurance program, but the coverage tops out at $250,000 for the structure and $100,000 for its contents. It is also peppered with exceptions.
 Supplementary flood insurance -- for any property, whether in or out of a flood zone -- is available through private insurers. Chubb, for example, recently began selling coverage that provides protection for up to $15 million in flood damage.
 Ground-floor apartments are probably the most vulnerable to flooding, but owners living on higher floors in a co-op or condo are exposed in another way: they could wind up paying assessments for damage to their building. Such assessments aren't covered by standard policies for individual co-op and condo units. 
 It's probably a good idea to check the adequacy of your building's insurance, too. It may not cover floods at all, or the coverage may be inadequate, or the deductible too steep. 
 Individual owners can also insure against flood-related assessments. As part of its flood policy, Chubb will pay up to $50,000 in assessments. TERI KARUSH ROGERSWeb Sites

HEADLINE: In Uruguay, Bush Finds Friendly Ear and Taste of Home

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: ESTANCIA ANCHORENA, Uruguay, March 10 

 BODY:
Of all of the Latin American nations President Bush is visiting this week, this one is the smallest, with a population that is roughly half that of New York City. 
 But it has two things that provide a particular draw: a left-leaning president in the area who is still willing to buck the anti-American push of regional strongmen like President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, and one who has a sprawling presidential retreat that is a cross between Camp David and Mr. Bush's Texas ranch.
In a news briefing that followed the first of two meetings at that retreat, a pastoral setting with goats, cows and horses near the border with Argentina, Mr. Bush and President Tabare Vazquez avoided their most contentious issues: Uruguay's objection to United States trade quotas, and what has to be displeasure at the White House with Uruguay's opposition to the Iraq war. 
 Mr. Bush renewed his pledge to create an overhaul of United States immigration laws that would include a guest worker program -- a prospect that continues to languish in Congress but will certainly come up again on the trip. ''I expressed to him that it is my interest to get a comprehensive immigration bill out of the United States Congress as soon as possible,'' he said.
 And Dr. Vazquez stuck to friendly, broad terms, recalling a visit to Uruguay by Mr. Bush's father in 1990, when the doctor was the mayor of Montevideo, the nation's capital.
 Most important, officials said, was to use the visit to raise up Dr. Vazquez, still a part-time oncologist, as an example of what Dan Fisk, the top Western hemisphere specialist on the National Security Council, on Friday called ''a country that is making the right policy choices.''
 Last month, the United States and Uruguay signed the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement to strengthen economic and trade ties without addressing the thorny issues of tariffs and subsidies. But Mr. Chavez has opposed the framework and is trying to push the region's Mercosur trade alliance toward a stronger anti-America political stance.
 Asked at the Saturday briefing about his position of juggling his country's expanding relations with the United States and its membership in Mercosur, Dr. Vazquez said he was ''strongly in favor of the regional process; we are where we are, and we don't want to leave this place.'' Though the trade alliance opposes individual bilateral deals by its members, he said, ''Mercosur should be able to integrate to other blocs, other countries in the world.''
 Neither he nor Mr. Bush mentioned Mr. Chavez, who was just across the Rio de la Plata in Buenos Aires, having staged a demonstration against Mr. Bush on Friday night.
 In fact, when Mr. Bush was asked what he thought of Mr. Chavez's taunts, the president, who has not even spoken Mr. Chavez's name, did not answer the question directly, saying, ''The trip is a statement of a desire to work together with people in our neighborhood.'' If he referred to Mr. Chavez's bombast at all, it was by emphasizing that ''I would call our diplomacy quiet and effective diplomacy.''
 At his rally in Buenos Aires on Friday night, Mr. Chavez mocked everything from Mr. Bush's poll ratings to his attempts to reach out in the region, and he said, ''Gringo, go home.''
 Afterward, Mr. Bush's aides complained about the attention the news media were giving to Mr. Chavez, whose reported influence in the region they said was overblown and resented by his neighbors.
 But even as Dr. Vazquez has made a show of friendship with Mr. Bush, as he did Saturday, he has also seemed to send signals to leftists like Mr. Chavez and others in the region that he has his own issues with American power.
 In remarks this month in which he also spoke about Mr. Bush's coming visit, Dr. Vazquez declared his was an ''anti-imperialist'' government, sharing the language of Mr. Chavez, who calls the United States an imperialist power. 
 When a group of Latin American journalists asked about that comment preceding the trip, Mr. Bush said last Tuesday, ''I would hope he would define my government as pro-freedom.''
 But officials here with Dr. Vazquez said he was not referring to the United States specifically, and was speaking in global terms. If anything, Uruguay seems very much to be swinging the United States' way more than Mr. Chavez's, providing important symbolism -- despite Uruguay's tiny size -- for Mr. Bush this week before he moves on to a leg of his trip with other friendly nations: Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico.
 And in a potential salve to the television images of anti-American protests even in Montevideo, Mr. Bush and Dr. Vazquez had a lunch of barbecue beef and took a boat ride together.

HEADLINE: Bush Heads to Colombia as Scandal Taints Key Alliance

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, March 10 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has no closer ally in South America than Colombia, the recipient of more than $4 billion in American aid this decade to combat drug trafficking and guerrilla insurgencies. But a widening scandal tying paramilitary death squads and drug traffickers to close supporters of President Alvaro Uribe is clouding President Bush's brief visit here on Sunday. 
 Since the scandal worsened in recent weeks, Democrats in the United States Congress have increased their scrutiny of two important measures before them: a broad trade agreement with Colombia that has already been signed by Mr. Bush and Mr. Uribe, and a request from the administration for a new $3.9 billion aid package for the country. 
 Claims of human rights abuses by political allies of Mr. Uribe, including the use of information from the executive branch's intelligence service to assassinate union organizers and university professors, have already resulted in the arrest of Jorge Noguera, a former chief of Colombia's secret police who was awarded that job after working on the president's campaign. 
 ''Uribe has certainly been considered a bright light here in the United States, but at some point you have to ask: what are these people doing?'' Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the Senate panel that oversees aid to Colombia, said in a telephone interview from Washington. ''It's time to take a pause and look at what we've done,'' he said, referring to the effectiveness of aid to Colombia. 
 Senior government officials here say concern over the scandal should not distract legislators in the United States from strides by Mr. Uribe since his presidency began in 2002. Mr. Uribe, an Oxford-educated lawyer, remains highly popular, with a 72 percent approval rating. Many Colombians, particularly in cities like Bogota and Medellin, have welcomed a break with the chaotic years early in the decade when violence by guerrillas and paramilitaries was more widespread. 
 ''This country was going to be Sudan, and we've turned a corner in a dramatic way,'' Vice President Francisco Santos said in an interview, referring to fears at one point that Colombia, destabilized by an internal war, could become a failed state. 
 He pointed to accomplishments like economic growth expected to surpass 6 percent this year, a reduction in violent crime rates in large cities, and a process demobilizing about 30,000 paramilitary combatants. 
 Mr. Santos expressed gratitude for American help with efforts to end Colombia's internal war, which has dragged on for more than four decades, displacing three million people. 
 Still, Mr. Santos turned on its head a statement by Winston Churchill about Americans always doing the right thing after exhausting all the alternatives by saying the United States had made ''all the right decisions'' in relation to Colombia. ''If the Congress doesn't approve the free trade agreement, the message is that being a friend of the United States doesn't pay,'' Mr. Santos said. 
 Supporters of Mr. Uribe say ties between paramilitary death squads and political supporters of the president are coming to light because of the resilience of Colombia's political institutions, particularly the Supreme Court, which has been investigating the connections. 
 The court's diligence despite death threats to its members has resulted in startling actions like an arrest warrant issued this month for Alvaro Araujo Noguera, a regional political boss implicated in the kidnapping of a member of a rival political family. Mr. Araujo, the father of Mr. Uribe's former foreign minister, Maria Consuelo Araujo, remains at large. 
 ''It is not our concern,'' said Alfredo Gomez Quintero, the magistrate at the Supreme Court leading the investigation, when asked in an interview how the revelations might affect American aid to Colombia. ''We know the eyes of the world are upon us. Our only job is to arrive at the truth.'' 
 Beyond the paramilitary scandal ensnaring members of Mr. Uribe's government and at least eight members of his coalition in Congress, human rights organizations are calling attention to the killings of trade union officials in the past six years. And there are claims of abuses involving American companies like the Drummond Company, a coal producer based in Birmingham, Ala. 
 A judge in Alabama this week allowed a civil lawsuit against Drummond to go forward in which the company is accused of allowing paramilitary gunmen to kill three union leaders at its operations in northern Colombia. 
 Drummond has repeatedly denied having a role in the killings, which have nonetheless generated skepticism over tightening trade relations with Colombia without safeguarding the rights of the working poor. 
 ''Our aid should be more focused on giving Colombian prosecutors the resources to do their job,'' said Representative Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat who visited Colombia this month. 
 Here in Bogota, officials point to Mr. Bush's visit, the first by an American president to the capital since Ronald Reagan in 1982, as evidence that the security situation has improved. Certainly the scrubbed prosperity of parts of Bogota, its hotels bulging with foreign business executives and even the occasional tourist, contrasts with the swaths of territory still controlled by leftist-inspired guerrilla organizations. 
 But Mr. Bush's visit has also drawn attention to the fact that Colombia, despite being the largest recipient of American aid outside the Middle East and Afghanistan, remains the world's largest producer of cocaine. 
 The recent emergence of shadowy new paramilitary organizations with an intense focus on the cocaine trade illustrates the hydra-headed nature of Colombia's traffickers, political analysts here say. 
 Mr. Santos, the vice president, said the supply of Colombian cocaine to the United States would be even greater without American antinarcotics aid. Mr. Bush is expected to stand by Mr. Uribe at a time when explicit allies in the region remain scarce. 
 The fragile stability in Colombia's largest cities and the slow-burning war in its countryside came into focus in the days before Mr. Bush's arrival, after Gen. Jorge Daniel Castro, the country's police commander, said officials had monitored communications by guerrillas about plans for sabotage and attacks to coincide with the visit. 
 More than 7,000 police officers have been assigned to protect Mr. Bush.

HEADLINE: Surprise! Spartans Assault Box Office

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 11 

 BODY:
Even a film business that expects big numbers is likely to be double-checking the box-office receipts for Warner Brothers' ''300'' on Monday and asking, ''What just happened?''
 The sword-and-sandals epic posted an estimated $70 million in ticket sales Friday through Sunday as it surged past hostile critics and industry expectations to become the fourth surprise hit in a winter season that began with a limp. 
''We had projected it coming in around the mid-30s,'' said Dan Fellman, Warner's president of theatrical distribution, referring to the $30 million mark. ''It's staggering.''
 The movie defied the odds in that it had no star bigger than the Scottish actor Gerard Butler (''The Phantom of the Opera''), Mr. Fellman said, it was made by the relatively untested director Zack Snyder (''Dawn of the Dead'') and it carried the added handicap of an R rating. 
 The opening of ''300'' was the third largest for an R-rated film, behind ''The Matrix Reloaded,'' which posted about $91.8 million in ticket sales on its first weekend in 2003, and ''The Passion of the Christ,'' which opened to about $84 million a year later.
 When the final tallies are in on Monday, Mr. Fellman said, Hollywood's overall box office for the year will have moved comfortably ahead of last year's pace after running slightly better than even through last week, mostly thanks to a series of recent films that, by conventional wisdom, were not supposed to be hits.
 Disney's ''Wild Hogs,'' a comedy that put stars as long in the tooth as John Travolta and Tim Allen on motorcycles, opened to nearly $40 million in ticket sales a week ago and picked up $28 million more this weekend, for a total of more than $77 million. Two weeks before that, ''Ghost Rider,'' with Nicolas Cage, surprised its distributors at Sony Pictures Entertainment with a $45 million weekend, and then went on to take in total domestic receipts of about $104 million through Sunday.
 Much the same happened with ''Norbit,'' a critically derided comedy in which Eddie Murphy played fat and female. That film took in $34 million on its first weekend in early February for DreamWorks and Paramount, on its way to about $88 million as of Sunday. 
 ''Lines beget lines,'' as viewers of one hit are exposed to trailers for the next, Chuck Viane, president of domestic distribution for Disney's Buena Vista unit, said. 
 During a telephone news conference on Tuesday, Dan Glickman, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America, cautiously predicted that eagerly awaited sequels coming later this year -- ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,'' ''Spider-Man 3,'' ''Shrek the Third,'' ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' -- would push the 2007 United States box-office total beyond last year's $9.49 billion, which in turn was up 5.5 percent from 2005. 
 But surprises like ''300'' can be even more lucrative than sequels. Part of the reason is lower budgets; Mr. Fellman placed the production cost of ''300'' at about $64 million, compared with $150 million or more for other blockbusters. Newly minted successes also tend to haul in proportionally more money from DVD sales and other aftermarkets (pay-television and airplane sales, for example) than do follow-up films.
 Critics were divided on the merits of Mr. Snyder's adaptation of Frank Miller and Lynn Varley's graphic novel about the Spartans' stand against the Persians at Thermopylae, which A. O. Scott's review in The New York Times described as ''about as violent as 'Apocalypto' and twice as stupid.'' (An admiring Richard Roeper, of The Chicago Sun-Times, called it ''gorgeous to behold.'') Still, ticket buyers were lining up for showings that sold out on various electronic services.
 Momentum had been building among fans since the film was introduced at last year's Comic-Con International comic book and popular arts convention. It received a boost about a month ago when a trailer -- highlighting the movie's stylized, computer-assisted visual approach -- caught fire on MySpace. Mr. Snyder and his collaborators also helped broaden the film's appeal among women by expanding a subplot, about the Spartan queen Gorgo. 
 ''300'' has been Hollywood's best March opening, not adjusted for inflation, passing the $68 million mark posted by ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' when it opened on March 31 last year and its weekend sales spilled into April. As such, it vindicated Mr. Snyder, who fought to adapt the graphic novel despite initial resistance at Warner, which had a tougher time in 2004 with the ancient epics ''Troy'' and ''Alexander.''
 ''That's the magic of our industry,'' Mr. Fellman said. ''Every once in a while these special moments happen.''

HEADLINE: Texans Want To Strike Rule On Projecting Retiree Care

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The nation's 50 states and the largest cities will soon be required to disclose the value of the health care they have promised their retired workers. The prospect of that disclosure, under a new accounting rule, is not a happy one for governments. 
 Cities or states that have already calculated the price of their retirement promises have often found the figures to be alarmingly high, angering taxpayer groups and posing a potential threat to government bond ratings. New York City, for instance, disclosed in the fall that its obligation for retiree health care was $53.5 billion.
Now Texas wants to opt out of the whole process, and hopes to persuade other states to join it. State Senator Robert Duncan, a Republican from Lubbock, has introduced a bill that would make the new accounting rule inoperable in Texas.
 ''The way we look at it is that this is probably not an accurate measurement for the type of retirement programs that we do,'' said Mr. Duncan, who sits on the Legislature's finance committee. A similar bill has been introduced in the Texas House. 
 In a related step, the Texas state comptroller, Susan Combs, recently wrote to the chairman of the accounting rule-making board, saying she doubted that the new rule had any validity in Texas. She requested a meeting ''to discuss possible resolutions to this problem.'' She also sent copies of her letter to her counterparts in the 49 other states, urging them to join Texas in seeking to block the new accounting rule.
 As chief financial officer of Texas, she said in her letter, ''I am having trouble appreciating the purpose of this standard.''
 At the accounting board, however, rule makers are having trouble appreciating the idea that a legislature could tamper with their work. 
 ''This standard was passed in 2004, after many years of due process,'' said Robert H. Attmore, chairman of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, an independent body known as GASB that sets the rules for state and local governments (and pronounced GAZ-bee). ''It's kind of late to be raising these issues.'' 
 Other accounting experts echoed his dismay. 
 ''Our legislature does crazy things,'' said Michael H. Granof, an accounting professor at the University of Texas. ''We have a law for blind hunters. This is probably the dumbest bill since that.'' 
 The accounting rule that is causing the commotion takes account of the practice in many states, towns and other jurisdictions around the country that have for decades promised retirement health care to their workers without ever tallying the cost. 
 Most governments have dealt with these retiree health plans on a ''pay as you go'' basis, buying a year's worth of coverage for their retirees every year and reporting those outlays as the cost of the plan. 
 But those reports miss the accumulating cost of what has been promised over the years to the millions of government workers who have not yet retired. Many of those workers are now reaching or approaching retirement age, and health care inflation has been increasing at double-digit rates. In some places, the costs are starting to balloon.
 But because the total obligation is not currently disclosed, it is nearly impossible to get an accurate reading on the size of the problem. Some government bodies have promised generous benefits, while others offer bare-bones plans; some have ample resources to pay what they owe, while others may be in over their heads.
 Buyers of municipal bonds want to know which are which, so that they can identify the places where governments could have difficulty repaying their bonds because of mounting retiree health costs. 
 ''I buy municipal bonds for my clients,'' said Robert G. Smith, president of Sage Advisory Service, a money management firm in Austin. ''I look at this issue very carefully. If you're going to tell me that you don't want to admit to this, and have no plan to deal with it, and have no intention of ever prefunding, I'll tell you, I ain't buying your bonds. Because I don't think you're a good risk.''
 The accounting rule requires only that governments disclose their total obligations -- not that they come up with the money right away. The numbers are to be disclosed in footnotes to the local governments' financial statements, not on their balance sheets, where, if they were reported, they would make many governments look bankrupt. 
 But even in footnotes, bond analysts and others will be able to monitor such data. Governments that allow retiree health care obligations to grow open-ended, without setting aside any money for them, will probably find their credit ratings being downgraded. 
 The accounting rule is being phased in over three years. The states and the largest cities will have to disclose the obligations for the first time in financial reports for their 2007 fiscal years. 
 For Texas, that means disclosing the information this fall. The state has not yet hired an actuary to do the formal calculations, but a preliminary estimate by legislative researchers suggested that the figure might be about $50 billion. 
 Mr. Duncan said he hoped that his bill would make the accounting board reconsider its requirement before the fall deadline. 
 ''We're hoping we can approach GASB to see if there is another way to deal with the issue,'' he said.
 State employees in Texas have no unions, only associations that do not engage in collective bargaining. Thus, there are no labor contracts between the state and its employees. Ms. Combs, the comptroller, contends that if there is no formal contract, there can be no obligation to disclose. She added that it would be hard to calculate the value of Texas's retiree health plan because it could be canceled at any time.
 Mr. Smith, of Sage Advisory, said he doubted that the state's public employees understood that their benefits could be rescinded.
 ''Let's say that to the faces of the cops and the firemen who've been risking their lives, lady comptroller,'' he remarked. ''Say it when they're pouring water on your burning house.'' 
 Officials at the accounting board said that even if Texas had no union contracts, it still had promised valuable benefits to its workers. 
 ''These retiree health care benefits are a form of compensation for services, in the same way as salaries and pensions are,'' Mr. Attmore, the GASB chairman, said. ''They're deferred compensation. So there is a real obligation there, whether there is a written contract or not.''
 He said this type of promise was called a ''constructive obligation,'' and had to be disclosed. If Texas were to cancel its retiree health plan at some point, he said, its disclosures for that year would show the change. 
 Andy Homer, director of government relations for the Texas Public Employees Association, said he feared that the disclosure itself would hasten the day when the state might try to rescind the retiree health care coverage it has already promised. 
 ''We don't have any contractual protections and we're kind of used to that,'' he said. Rather than negotiating labor contracts, the association tries to protect members' benefits by lobbying the state government. 
 Three years ago, Texas scaled back its retiree health program, he said. The association worked with state lawmakers then to try to make the cuts as fair as possible. 
 If Texas were to disclose the total cost of the slimmed-down plan that resulted, he said, the figure might scare people into calling for even more cuts. ''Legislators see these big numbers and they don't understand it,'' he said, ''and they want to do away with the benefit.''

HEADLINE: Log In Your Measurements, And the Clothes May Well Fit

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
CUSTOMERS bought $9.6 billion worth of apparel online in the United States last year, according to Forrester Research, the Internet consulting firm. But not one of those customers tried anything on first.
 That is one reason that online purchases represent a paltry 5 percent of overall apparel sales. Customers return 30 percent of the clothes they buy online, industry executives say.
So why not have a Web site where users can provide their basic body dimensions and style preferences, then see all the available clothing that would fit well and suit their taste? It is an idea so obvious that one wonders why it isn't an established part of online shopping already: merchandise returns would drop, customers might well be happier and the Web site would earn a commission for every sale. 
 That is the approach of a new Internet company, myShape.com, which has recorded the measurements of about 20,000 women in a five-month trial period that ended Sunday. The women shopped from personalized clothing collections matched to their style and fit preferences and body dimensions. 
 So far the method seems to be working, said Louise J. Wannier, myShape's chief executive, particularly among women 35 and older, the company's target audience. Customers are buying clothes at a rate far higher than the industry average, and are returning them at half the industry average. Shipping is free both ways.
 As impressive as these results may be, myShape's approach will probably fail to gain a mass audience unless the company can somehow simplify the measuring process, said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''They're probably a little ahead of their time,'' she said.
 Ms. Mulpuru said only a small percentage of women would accept the site's offer to mail them a free tape measure, and fewer would go through the hassle of taking the measurements and logging them into the myShape system. Those who do, she said, are rewarded with a computer application that ''does a nice job'' of recommending clothes that fit the user's body and style preferences.
 Ms. Wannier, of myShape, said that as of today, the company is reducing the number of measurement and style-related responses it requires of users, to the point where they can complete their profile in less than 10 minutes. ''We're still fine-tuning,'' she said.
 To some consumers, like Susan Chastain, a biotechnology consultant in Palo Alto, Calif., even the longer myShape measurement process was not too great a hurdle. Ms. Chastain said she sent myShape her dimensions in October, and had since spent about $400 at the site on a pair of pants and two blouses. The clothes fit and matched her taste, she said.
 ''What they recommended on the site reflected what I've been wearing or have been drawn to,'' Ms. Chastain said. ''Some women might be surprised to find things that would look good on their body. But with no shipping fees, what's the downside of trying?''
 Ms. Mulpuru said one thing that might help myShape reach a mass audience would be if the company somehow offered to take body scans of people at malls and other locations, saving them the trouble of measuring themselves. 
 Coincidentally, a similar service will make its debut on Thursday. Intellifit, which makes body scanners that have been sparingly used in recent years to help fit customers at Nordstrom and Levi's stores, among others, will place a scanner at the Philadelphia airport and offer free measurements, in which users remove leather and metal items and stand in the scanning machine for 10 seconds.
 An Intellifit representative watches the user's valuables and logs the user's measurements and e-mail address into the system. Users are then sent an e-mail message with a password for Intellifit.com, where they may select from an assortment of clothes from seven companies, including Nordstrom, Levi's and Lands' End. 
 The site will initially serve men but will add women's clothing in June, according to Albert Charpentier, Intellifit's founder. It features only men's clothing at the moment, he said, because men's apparel manufacturers change their styles less frequently and are therefore more likely to invest time in sending product specifications to him.
 Mr. Charpentier, who led the design team for the original Commodore 64 computer in the early 1980s, said Intellifit would install a scanner at Newark Liberty Airport and at Baltimore/Washington airport in the next three months.
 Even after getting the measurements of consumers, apparel-matching services like Intellifit and myShape face challenges. Clothing manufacturers can be reluctant to take the precise measurements of their clothes and send them along.
 Mr. Charpentier said he recently contacted Ms. Wannier of MyShape to discuss the possibility of a partnership. Among other things, Intellifit could help myShape increase the number of customers who submit body measurements, while myShape could help Intellifit break into the women's market.
 ''There's definitely something we'll do together,'' Ms. Wannier said, adding, though, that it was premature to discuss details. 
 She said her site featured more than 100 clothing designers, considerably more than boutiques but far less than a typical Macy's store. The choices on the site, she added, are sparser for women in petite and large sizes, and for those who do not want business-casual and weekend-wear styles.
 Designers working with myShape say they are optimistic about the site's prospects. Randa Allen, president of Notice, a Los Angeles designer featured on myShape, said, ''I think it's way promising, especially for the generation that's growing up now with a computer attached to their arms.''
 But she added: ''We're baby-stepping it with them, though. Hopefully we'll be loyal to each other, and someday they'll be a bigger part of our business.''
 Ms. Allen said it helped that MyShape bought items wholesale from her company and shipped them directly to consumers, instead of requiring Notice to do the shipping. Most designers on myShape, Ms. Wannier said, ship directly to consumers and myShape collects a commission.
 Should the Web site and Intellifit gain a following, they would join My Virtual Model, based in Montreal, and zafu.com, based in Emeryville, Calif., as technology companies most involved in helping customers find better-fitting clothes online. 
 My Virtual Model has worked with Lands' End, Sears and other companies to offer on-screen representations that help those sites' customers try on clothes virtually before buying them. Louise Guay, chief executive of myvirtualmodel.com, said that in the coming weeks, the service would allow users to mix and match clothes from different retailers and replace the generic faces of the models with pictures of their own faces. 
 Zafu, which began operations late last year, helps women find better fitting jeans and it, too, is expanding, said Robert Holloway, the company's chief executive. The site's traffic is growing more than 30 percent a month, and nearly a million women have logged body-measurement data onto the site and searched for jeans. In May, he said, Zafu would add plus-size jeans and in June, bras.

HEADLINE: Diving Into the Pool, With a Lifeline to Success

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: keepingscore@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When it comes time to pick a champion in an N.C.A.A. bracket, people tend to cluster around a few of the favorites. Last year, more than half of the 3.1 million entries in ESPN.com's Tournament Challenge predicted that Connecticut or Duke would win it all. In 2005, more than half went with Illinois or North Carolina.
 But the tournament itself is usually not as kind to favorites as the fans are. It requires its champion to win six consecutive games -- at least a couple of which will come against an outstanding opponent -- and not even the No. 1 or No. 2 team in the country reliably survives. 
 The men's tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985 (and added a 65th team, with a play-in game, in 2001). In those 22 years, teams that entered the tournament ranked first or second in the Associated Press poll won it eight times. Teams ranked third or fourth won it four times.
 So the top four teams entering the tournament -- typically the No. 1 seeds in the four regions -- have won the title only a little more than half of the time since 1985. Yet they draw an overwhelming majority of selections.
 At first glance, this focus on the favorites seems to make perfect sense. History suggests that the top-ranked teams really are more likely than other teams to win the tournament. If you cared only about picking the correct national champion, it would be smart to choose a team like Ohio State or Kansas this year.
 The problem is that you would have a lot of company. To finish at the top of your pool, which is what matters to most people, you would have to do extraordinarily well in the rest of your bracket. 
 ''What people don't realize is that a lot of times, if you bet on a No. 1 seed, you're out of the pool after the first weekend,'' said Andrew Metrick, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied pools. ''Your team won, but you're out'' -- because you missed a few other games that others with the same choice of national champion did not miss.
 By avoiding the fashionable picks and instead choosing a team with a slightly worse chance to win it all, people leave themselves with greater margin for error. This happened in many office pools last year: Those who went with Florida, ranked 11th entering the tournament and seeded third, were able to win even if they did not do exceptionally well with their other picks. In some cases, those who chose U.C.L.A., ranked seventh at this time last year and the eventual runner-up, even came out on top.
 The lesson is basic: As long as everyone else is clustering around a couple of favorites, you hurt your chances by joining them.
 (A quick note about the law is in order. The online games run by ESPN and others are legal because they are free to enter. Office pools are generally illegal, but many police officials say they have no interest in stopping pools unless the organizers are trying to make money.) 
 N.C.A.A. pools have become a popular subject of academic research in the past two decades because they give social scientists a chance to watch a large cross section of the population making decisions -- sometimes rationally, sometimes not. Some of this, of course, is justification; economists who study brackets, and journalists who write about their work, tend to be sports fans.
 But pools do make a broader point about human behavior. Frequently, people make decisions without fully taking into account the actions of others. Investors, for instance, may buy stock because they believe a company will do well in coming years, but they fail to consider the possibility that the stock price already reflects that information.
 Here are a few other lessons from past brackets:
 The top-ranked team is not always the most fashionable choice. 
 In 2004, Stanford entered the tournament ranked No. 1 in the A.P. poll, but Kentucky, ranked second, was the most popular choice in the bracket that year on Sports Illustrated's Web site. Connecticut ended up winning the tournament. Over all, the predictions that year were a little more spread out than usual. 
 A similar thing could happen this year. Ohio State is ranked first in the polls, but Florida and North Carolina, also No. 1 seeds, may end up being trendier choices. Like Stanford, Ohio State has not won a title in decades, and many fans may consider the team susceptible to choking. To stay away from the crowds, you may have to be more creative than merely avoiding Ohio State.
 The seedings do not reflect the best information about the quality of teams.
 The Ratings Percentage Index rankings used by the N.C.A.A. selection committee do not take into account a team's average margin of victory over the course of the season. Doing so seems distasteful because it would give teams incentive to run up the score during the regular season.
 But teams that win comfortably do better in the future, across all sports, than teams that squeak by. As popular as it may be to believe that some teams just know how to win, there is almost no evidence to support the idea.
 Taking into account margin of victory and strength of schedule, computerized rankings suggest that Florida may be the weakest No. 1 seed. Texas A&M, a third seed, looks as strong as most No. 2 seeds, and its upset loss to Oklahoma State last week may scare away some. Maryland appears to be the best No. 4 seed.
 Hometown favorites also draw a crowd. But maybe that's O.K.
 A study by Metrick in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization in the 1990s found that more people in New York picked Seton Hall to win the 1993 tournament than anywhere else. More people in Boston chose the University of Massachusetts. North Carolina defeated Michigan in the final.
 So to win a pool, it makes sense to avoid the local team. On the other hand, the odds of a winning a big pool are small even if you do everything by the book. It may make for a more enjoyable tournament if you instead pick a team that you root for.

HEADLINE: Legislature Acts to Restore Spitzer's Cuts In Health Care

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
The New York State Assembly and Senate introduced budget bills and resolutions on Friday and over the weekend that would restore several hundred million dollars in health care spending cut by Gov. Eliot Spitzer in his executive budget. 
 The separate measures further delineate what is proving to be the main battleground as the governor and Legislature negotiate a budget: the governor's plan to broadly overhaul the way the state spends money on Medicaid.
But how much the Legislature can achieve remains to be seen, because not enough votes are expected to override any vetoes by Mr. Spitzer. And the two chambers, led by different parties, still have to negotiate between themselves as well as with the governor. 
 In his budget, Mr. Spitzer cut about $1.3 billion from Medicaid and other health programs, although the figure includes both state spending and federal matching funds. 
 The Assembly, controlled by the Democrats, would restore about $236 million of the $520 million in state spending cuts to hospitals and nursing homes, according to an analysis by 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, the health care workers' union. 
 Among the budget restorations, the Assembly would continue annual inflation adjustments in Medicaid payments made to health care providers, though Mr. Spitzer's plan eliminated such adjustments. The Assembly, over all, increased Mr. Spitzer's $120.6 billion budget to nearly $121.3 billion.
 The Senate is expected to restore more than the Assembly and to turn back the bulk of the governor's health care cuts. The overall restoration figures from the Senate were not available yesterday evening. 
 ''We're still working on that,'' said John McArdle, a spokesman for Republicans who lead the Senate. Mr. McArdle did say that the Senate would, as expected, reject the governor's plan to close more than $400 million worth of what Mr. Spitzer called corporate tax loopholes. The Senate also planned to increase education spending to offset what it sees as inequities in Mr. Spitzer's plan that favor New York City. 
 Jennifer Cunningham, a senior adviser to 1199, said the Assembly's budget should have gone further. ''We are shocked and disappointed that the Assembly majority would be willing to vote in favor of hundreds of millions of hospital and nursing home cuts,'' she said. 
 The union and a leading hospital group, the Greater New York Hospital Association, have been locked in a bitter fight with the governor over his budget. In new competing television advertisements, the union accuses Mr. Spitzer of turning his back on nurses, while the governor accuses ''special interests'' in the health care industry of spending money on ads instead of on patients. 
 A new mailing from 1199 and the hospital association features several politicians, including Democratic Representatives Charles B. Rangel and Kirsten Gillibrand, expressing concern about cuts to hospitals. 
 In a statement last month, Mr. Spitzer said, ''No amount of distortion, scare tactics and mischaracterization will change the underlying fact that New York's health care system is broken.''

HEADLINE: Bush to Press Free Trade in a Place Where Young Children Still Cut the Cane

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: CHIMALTENANGO, Guatemala, March 11 

 BODY:
Work starts early for the people of the Guatemalan countryside, sometimes as early as 5 or 6. Not the time, the age. 
 Guatemalan children shine shoes and make bricks. They cut cane and mop floors. At some factories exporting to the United States, they sew and sort and chop, often in conditions so onerous they violate even Guatemala's very loose labor laws.
 ''They like us young people because we don't say anything when they yell at us,'' said Alma de los Angeles Zambrano, 15, who recently quit after 18 months at a food processing plant to work part time for an organization trying to improve conditions for young workers.
 President Bush is likely to miss this side of Guatemala's labor market when he comes to this rural area on Monday to visit a thriving agricultural cooperative that sells products to Wal-Mart's stores in Central America. The president will meet with Mariano Canu, the leader of a United States-backed co-op that hopes to take advantage of the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Canu is doing well enough that his children are in school preparing for Guatemala's new economy. 
 Opening up trade, Mr. Bush argues, will ultimately raise wages and improve working conditions in Central America. ''My message to those trabajadores y campesinos,'' Mr. Bush said last week, using the Spanish words for workers and peasants, ''is you have a friend in the United States of America. We care about your plight.''
 But this country's young workers, most of them poor indigenous people, say they often feel that nobody cares about them: not their parents, who send them off to the work force; not their stern bosses, who treat them like adults; not the dysfunctional government off in Guatemala City. 
 ''It's a major concern,'' said Manuel Manrique, Unicef's representative in Guatemala. ''Child labor keeps children out of school. The numbers are very high and there's a social acceptance in this country that child labor is O.K.''
 None of the child workers interviewed around here said they had yet felt any benefits of Cafta, as the trade pact is known, which Guatemala signed nearly two years ago and which slipped through the United States Congress by a hair. One provision in Cafta, which is intended to increase trade by eliminating tariff and nontariff barriers, requires companies to adhere to local labor laws and commits the United States to helping improve inspections. 
 But that is easier said than done. Guatemala's labor code sets the minimum age for employment at 14. In some cases, though, the government can provide work permits to even younger children. Children under 14, who require parental permission to work, are supposed to work in apprenticeships appropriate for their age. Economic necessity in the family must be shown, which is not a problem in this country where 80 percent of the population lives in poverty and two-thirds of that number, or 7.6 million people, live in extreme poverty. 
 But with little enforcement of labor laws, those conditions are routinely violated. Guatemalan workplaces can resemble grade schools, with adult supervisors standing over little laborers like the strictest of teachers. 
 The State Department acknowledged in its latest human rights report for Guatemala released this month that ''child labor was a widespread and serious problem'' and that ''laws governing the employment of minors were not enforced effectively.'' 
 A few hours before leaving for Guatemala on Saturday, Gordon D. Johndroe, the National Security Council spokesman traveling with Mr. Bush, said: ''Cafta, in its nine-month existence, is beginning to bring economic benefits to the people of Central America, but it will clearly take some time before all those benefits are fully realized. We'll continue to work with the Guatemalan government to make sure all obligations to their people are met.''
 An independent study of the issue estimated that about a million Guatemalan children under age 18 are working. Another review by the United Nations found 16 percent of children between the ages of 5 and 14 in the labor force in 2000, more of them boys than girls. 
 The child workers are people like Maria, 16, who lamented her four years in the labor force but at the same time insisted that she not be fully identified so as not to endanger a job that is helping to support her parents and four brothers and sisters. 
 ''My father hits me and tells me I can't study,'' she said, tears running down her cheeks. ''He stays home and drinks and I have to go to the factory.'' 
 She studies on the sly. On Sundays, her only day off, she goes to special classes for young laborers offered by the Center for Study and Support for Local Development, a small group known by its Spanish initials, Ceadel. Despite having worked at a factory since she was 12 and at home for years before that, Maria has now completed the equivalent of third grade. 
 ''I can be so tired, so exhausted, but I feel so good when I come home and read,'' she said, her tears stopping and her face lighting up. ''It can be any book. I just like to see the words.'' 
 Critics of Cafta see Guatemala's child labor problem as evidence of the flaws in so-called free trade.
 Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, was one of the principle opponents of Cafta while he was in the House of Representatives. ''These trade agreements were written for investors in large American corporations,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''They weren't written for American workers and they weren't written to protect Central American children.'' 
 Cafta's backers, however, say it will take time to lift countries like Guatemala out of poverty and to improve longstanding social problems like child labor. The United States government is paying for efforts to improve the Ministry of Labor, which is now so dysfunctional that some inspectors say that since they work during the day they cannot possibly investigate reports that children are working night shifts. 
 Mr. Bush, in his speech in Washington before leaving on his Latin American trip, said American government aid had helped lift Guatemala's percentage of children who complete first grade to 71 percent from 51 percent, a significant increase but one that illustrates the dire state of education in the country.
 ''Children have more energy and they don't complain or know anything about unions,'' said Carlos Toledo, whose Asociacion Nuestros Derechos aids child laborers. ''For a company, they are perfect.''
 To draw attention to the issue of child labor in advance of Mr. Bush's visit to Chimaltenango, the National Labor Committee, a New York-based group that has investigated gross labor violations worldwide, interviewed child workers in the area. 
 The group focused on Legumex, a factory that exports broccoli, melons and other fruits and vegetables to the United States, and in a report to be issued on Monday accuses it of violating a host of labor laws, including employing children, some as young as 13, for shifts longer than permitted.
 Charles Kernaghan, director of the labor group, traced the food exports to American food service marketers that distributes to schools, hospitals, restaurants and the military. ''It is very possible that children in the U.S. may be eating broccoli harvested and processed by other children in Guatemala,'' Mr. Kernaghan said in a statement.
 But at Legumex, executives interviewed about child labor in general insisted that they were complying with labor laws. They said they did not employ children under 18 without parental permission. They said they paid low wages -- which they said were the legal minimum of about a dollar a day but that Mr. Kernaghan said were well below it -- because of the low prices paid for their products in the United States.
 ''We're a developing country,'' said Hermann Peterson, the company's auditor. ''We can't have the same conditions as factories in the United States.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 14, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about child labor in Guatemala, one of the five countries President Bush visited on a trip to Latin America, misstated the minimum wage there. It is about $1 an hour, not $1 a day.

HEADLINE: Where Tobacco Ruled, Smoking Ban Gains Ground

BYLINE: By THEO EMERY

DATELINE: ADAMS, Tenn., March 8 

 BODY:
A century ago, a battle called the Black Patch War raged across Robertson County, where Rick Gregory's ancestors grew tobacco. In the vicious fight over prices, nightriders with rifles raided farms and dynamited equipment. Tobacco barns burned in the night, and salted beds lay fallow.
 That tobacco war ended long ago, but in recent years, the crop grown in places like Robertson County has fueled another battle, this time over smoking, that has reached far beyond the rich tobacco fields along the Kentucky border.
Tennessee will probably become the first major tobacco-growing state to pass a comprehensive smoke-free-workplace law. Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, proposed the ban in February. He also wants to triple taxes on cigarette sales and to use some of the money for smoking prevention.
 The proposals show how far public policy toward smoking has shifted, even in tobacco-friendly Robertson County, Mr. Gregory said. 
 Mr. Gregory, 56, worked in his family's fields as a youngster and put himself through college on tobacco profits. Now a historian and a smoking opponent, he says the battle over tobacco is over. This year, he said, there will be none planted in his farm's rich bottom along the banks of the Red River.
 ''I think the fact that the governor will support a smoking ban shows not only the change that's taking place in Robertson County, but the change that's taking place in the state as a whole,'' he said. ''Politically it would have been suicide, until fairly recently.''
 Mr. Bredesen said he proposed the ban because he felt the time was right. The harmful effects of smoking are well documented, he said, and tobacco's declining clout in the state has now made it possible.
 ''It's something you couldn't have done in Tennessee a decade ago,'' Mr. Bredesen said. ''I think people are ready for it. Everything is not seen through the prism of being a tobacco state.'' 
 The legislation is expected to pass this year because of its support -- if qualified -- in the General Assembly from both the House speaker and Senate president, and important business groups, including the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce.
 Not everyone, however, is thrilled. Paul McKinney, who grows only a small amount of tobacco on his farm, compared the proposal to forbidding alcohol and unhealthy foods. 
 ''I can see raising the tax and getting more money,'' Mr. McKinney said, ''but if you're planning on just banning tobacco altogether, you're killing the goose that's laying the golden egg.''
 Tennessee's dependence on tobacco has made the state one of the most hostile in the nation to tobacco regulation. As antismoking laws spread, Tennessee has given free rein to smokers. The only restriction aside from a few local regulations is a year-old ban on smoking in state buildings.
 Washington, D.C.; Puerto Rico; and 22 states have passed bans on smoking in bars, restaurants, or all workplaces. The top tobacco growing states -- North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia and South Carolina -- have not passed such legislation, according to Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, an advocacy group based in Berkeley, Calif.
 ''What's exciting here is that we're seeing more activity in what is traditionally tobacco country,'' said Annie Tegen, senior program manager for the group. ''Times are definitely changing, and just because they grow tobacco there does not mean that they're not going to take public health seriously.'' 
 Gary Nolan, a spokesman for the Smokers' Club, a national property rights group, said the possibility of such a law in a tobacco state is unusual, but not surprising. Tobacco, Mr. Nolan said, is the ''enemy du jour'' for smoking opponents, who he called ''antis.''
 Tobacco's falling fortunes can be seen in Tennessee's annual crop statistics. The state's peak tobacco year -- for both burley, a light-colored tobacco used for cigarettes, and dark-fired tobacco used for dipping -- was 1982, when farmers harvested 178 million pounds valued at nearly $307 million, data from the federal Department of Agriculture show. 
 In 1999, the harvest was 122 million pounds, valued at $239 million. After a 2005 federal tobacco buyout compensated growers who backed out of the industry, farmers last year harvested 49 million pounds, worth $93 million, the statistics show. 
 The state agriculture commissioner, Ken Givens, a former tobacco farmer who once headed the Agriculture Committee in the State House of Representatives, said there had been a sea change in tobacco's role in state politics. As recently as 10 years ago, politicians seeking to regulate tobacco could expect to be pilloried. 
 ''The profitability is gone,'' Mr. Givens said, ''and a lot of farmers have simply exited the program and are not doing it anymore, so it's not like a golden crop.'' 
 In times past, tobacco was the economic engine in places like Robertson County. Visitors to Springfield, the county seat, about 30 miles north of Nashville, drove beneath enormous archways on the city's north and south sides that read ''World's Finest Dark Fired Tobacco.'' 
 The signs are gone, and around the city rolling farmland once famous for the quality of its tobacco is sprouting residential neighborhoods, the deep red dirt smoothed into future lawns around neat rows of new homes. 
 In Springfield, the Courthouse Cafe faces the town's historic square. On a recent afternoon, about half the customers smoked as they chatted around tables and along the lunch counter.
 Gwen Copeland, a 52-year-old waitress, slid into a bright yellow booth and lighted a Kool Mild 100, leaning over for spoonfuls of sundae offered by a customer's young daughter. Ms. Copeland does not feel any ambivalence about the proposal.
 ''Well, I think it's a free country, and I should be able to smoke if I want to,'' she said, adding, ''It used to be a free country. Now you can't do anything.''
 A few doors away, tobacco is the centerpiece of the Robertson County History Museum. An exhibit displays photos of tobacco barns and warehouses, antique pouches and cigarette tins, and an 1892 Winchester nightrider rifle. A plaque on the wall reads, in part, ''Robertson County can always remember when tobacco was king.'' 
 A museum employee, Peggy Mofield, leads the way to the museum's basement, flicking on overhead lights to show more relics: an old desk from a tobacco company, a sheaf of dried leaves on top, and a low hand cart called a duckbill beside it, piled with baskets stenciled with the words ''tobacco pride.'' 
 Ms. Mofield, 72, said she quit smoking 20 years ago for health reasons. She agreed that a tobacco ban in Tennessee would have been unthinkable a few years ago. But the grip of tobacco companies has weakened, she said, and knowledge about smoking's harmful effects has widened. 
 Tapping her temple with her index finger, she smiled and said, ''We're getting smarter.''

HEADLINE: China Set to Loosen Exchange Rate of Yuan

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BEIJING, Monday, March 12 

 BODY:
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, said Monday that it would gradually increase the flexibility in the exchange rate of the yuan, the national currency. 
 The statement, distributed ahead of a news conference by Zhou Xiaochuan, the central bank governor, provided no details on the degree of flexibility the bank would permit. But China has come under increasing pressure, particularly from the United States, to loosen artificial controls on the yuan and permit it to rise in value. The current rate is about 7.74 yuan to the dollar.
Many economists say a stronger yuan would ease the yawning American trade deficit with China by making Chinese exports to the United States more expensive and American exports to China cheaper.
 The statement came less than a week after Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, said in a visit to Shanghai that China must accelerate its economic reforms.

HEADLINE: Too Much of Nothing, a Japanese Affliction

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
The phenomenon of hikikomori casts a pall over Japan's image, solidifying a certain view of the country as a place afflicted with especially peculiar varieties of social dysfunction. Those mired in hikikomori, mostly teenagers and young adults, retreat from the world, isolating themselves in their rooms for months or even years at a time, relying on the Internet, video games and comic books as their sole sources of external connection. Support groups for parents struggling with self-confining children have sprung up all over the country. 
 Hikikomori, which literally means withdrawal, has received no shortage of journalistic treatment either here or abroad. But ''The Attic,'' a smart, sensitive play by the Japanese writer Yoji Sakate currently having its American premiere with the Play Company, takes us beyond conventional wisdom on the trend's origins, which has tended to understand it as a reaction to Japan's intensely competitive educational and economic systems.
Through a series of vignettes acted out in Takeshi Kata's appropriately claustrophobic set -- an attic that is a wooden box with a slanted roof -- Mr. Sakate links hikikomori to a greater human impulse toward isolation in periods of crisis and violence. He shows us mountaineers in the wilderness, retreating from life, and nations cutting themselves off from the world in times of war, just as he shows us teenagers tired of modern existence and the anguished parents who must deal with them. 
 Mr. Sakate's language is economical, poignant. ''Why not move into some sort of facility?'' a mother asks her son. ''That way you'll at least wash your face in the morning. Everyone washes their face.''
 ''The Attic'' arrives just as the Pearl Theater is reviving ''The Cave Dwellers,'' William Saroyan's 1957 play about a group of misfits who sequester themselves in a ruined old theater. Mr. Sakate's offering is a fitting companion piece. Where Saroyan sees nobility in failure and retreat, the Japanese playwright sees none. And the effect is unquestionably more profound.''The Attic'' continues through March 25 at the Play Company, 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan; (212) 279-4200 or ticketcentral.com.

HEADLINE: Journeys to the Distant Fields of Prime

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Four hundred people packed into an auditorium at U.C.L.A. in January to listen to a public lecture on prime numbers, one of the rare occasions that the topic has drawn a standing-room-only audience.
 Another 35 people watched on a video screen in a classroom next door. Eighty people were turned away.
The speaker, Terence Tao, a professor of mathematics at the university, promised ''a whirlwind tour, the equivalent to going through Paris and just seeing the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe.''
 His words were polite, unassuming and tinged with the accent of Australia, his homeland. Even though prime numbers have been studied for 2,000 years, ''There's still a lot that needs to be done,'' Dr. Tao said. ''And it's still a very exciting field.'' 
 After Dr. Tao finished his one-hour talk, which was broadcast live on the Internet, several students came down to the front and asked for autographs.
 Dr. Tao has drawn attention and curiosity throughout his life for his prodigious abilities. By age 2, he had learned to read. At 9, he attended college math classes. At 20, he finished his Ph.D.
 Now 31, he has grown from prodigy to one of the world's top mathematicians, tackling an unusually broad range of problems, including ones involving prime numbers and the compression of images. Last summer, he won a Fields Medal, often considered the Nobel Prize of mathematics, and a MacArthur Fellowship, the ''genius'' award that comes with a half-million dollars and no strings.
 ''He's wonderful,'' said Charles Fefferman of Princeton University, himself a former child prodigy and a Fields Medalist. ''He's as good as they come. There are a few in a generation, and he's one of the few.''
 Colleagues have teasingly called Dr. Tao a rock star and the Mozart of Math. Two museums in Australia have requested his photograph for their permanent exhibits. And he was a finalist for the 2007 Australian of the Year award.
 ''You start getting famous for being famous,'' Dr. Tao said. ''The Paris Hilton effect.''
 Not that any of that has noticeably affected him. His campus office is adorned with a poster of ''Ranma 1/2,'' a Japanese comic book. As he walks the halls of the math building, he might be wearing an Adidas sweatshirt, blue jeans and scruffy sneakers, looking much like one of his graduate students. He said he did not know how he would spend the MacArthur money, though he mentioned the mortgage on the house that he and his wife, Laura, an engineer at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, bought last year. 
 After a childhood in Adelaide, Australia, and graduate school at Princeton, Dr. Tao has settled into sunny Southern California. 
 ''I love it a lot,'' he said. But not necessarily for what the area offers. 
 ''It's sort of the absence of things I like,'' he said. No snow to shovel, for instance. 
 A deluge of media attention following his Fields Medal last summer has slowed to a trickle, and Dr. Tao said he was happy that his fame might be fleeting so that he could again concentrate on math.
 One area of his research -- compressed sensing -- could have real-world use. Digital cameras use millions of sensors to record an image, and then a computer chip in the camera compresses the data. 
 ''Compressed sensing is a different strategy,'' Dr. Tao said. ''You also compress the data, but you try to do it in a very dumb way, one that doesn't require much computer power at the sensor end.''
 With Emmanuel Candes, a professor of applied and computational mathematics at the California Institute of Technology, Dr. Tao showed that even if most of the information were immediately discarded, the use of powerful algorithms could still reconstruct the original image. 
 By useful coincidence, Dr. Tao's son, William, and Dr. Candes's son attended the same preschool, so dropping off their children turned into useful work time. 
 ''We'd meet each other every morning at preschool,'' Dr. Tao said, ''and we'd catch up on what we had done.''
 The military is interested in using the work for reconnaissance: blanket a battlefield with simple, cheap cameras that might each record a single pixel of data. Each camera would transmit the data to a central computer that, using the mathematical technique developed by Dr. Tao and Dr. Candes, would construct a comprehensive view. Engineers at Rice University have made a prototype of just such a camera.
 Dr. Tao's best-known mathematical work involves prime numbers -- positive whole numbers that can be divided evenly only by themselves and 1. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 13 (1 is excluded). 
 As numbers get larger, prime numbers become sparser, but the Greek mathematician Euclid proved sometime around 300 B.C. that there is nonetheless an infinite number of primes.
 Many questions about prime numbers continue to elude answers. Euclid also believed that there was an infinite number of ''twin primes'' -- pairs of prime numbers separated by 2, like 3 and 5 or 11 and 13 -- but he was unable to prove his conjecture. Nor has anyone else in the succeeding 2,300 years.
 A larger unknown question is whether hidden patterns exist in the sequence of prime numbers or whether they appear randomly. 
 In 2004, Dr. Tao, along with Ben Green, a mathematician now at the University of Cambridge in England, solved a problem related to the Twin Prime Conjecture by looking at prime number progressions -- series of numbers equally spaced. (For example, 3, 7 and 11 constitute a progression of prime numbers with a spacing of 4; the next number in the sequence, 15, is not prime.) Dr. Tao and Dr. Green proved that it is always possible to find, somewhere in the infinity of integers, a progression of prime numbers of any spacing and any length.
 ''Terry has a style that very few have,'' Dr. Fefferman said. ''When he solves the problem, you think to yourself, 'This is so obvious and why didn't I see it? Why didn't the 100 distinguished people who thought about this before not think of it?' ''
 Dr. Tao's proficiency with numbers appeared at a very young age. ''I always liked numbers,'' he said.
 A 2-year-old Terry Tao used toy blocks to show older children how to count. He was quick with language and used the blocks to spell words like ''dog'' and ''cat.''
 ''He probably was quietly learning these things from watching 'Sesame Street,' '' said his father, Dr. Billy Tao, a pediatrician who immigrated to Australia from Hong Kong in 1972. ''We basically used 'Sesame Street' as a babysitter.'' 
 The blocks had been bought as toys, not learning tools. ''You expect them to throw them around,'' said the elder Dr. Tao, whose accent swings between Australian and Chinese.
 Terry's parents placed him in a private school when he was 3 1/2. They pulled him out six weeks later because he was not ready to spend that much time in a classroom, and the teacher was not ready to teach someone like him.
 At age 5, he was enrolled in a public school, and his parents, administrators and teachers set up an individualized program for him. He proceeded through each subject at his own pace, quickly accelerating through several grades in math and science while remaining closer to his age group in other subjects. In English classes, for instance, he became flustered when he had to write essays. 
 ''I never really got the hang of that,'' he said. ''These very vague, undefined questions. I always liked situations where there were very clear rules of what to do.''
 Assigned to write a story about what was going on at home, Terry went from room to room and made detailed lists of the contents.
 When he was 7 1/2, he began attending math classes at the local high school.
 Billy Tao knew the trajectories of child prodigies like Jay Luo, who graduated with a mathematics degree from Boise State University in 1982 at the age of 12, but who has since vanished from the world of mathematics. 
 ''I initially thought Terry would be just like one of them, to graduate as early as possible,'' he said. But after talking to experts on education for gifted children, he changed his mind.
 ''To get a degree at a young age, to be a record-breaker, means nothing,'' he said. ''I had a pyramid model of knowledge, that is, a very broad base and then the pyramid can go higher. If you just very quickly move up like a column, then you're more likely to wobble at the top and then collapse.''
 Billy Tao also arranged for math professors to mentor Terry. 
 A couple of years later, Terry was taking university-level math and physics classes. He excelled in international math competitions. His parents decided not to push him into college full time, so he split his time between high school and Flinders University, the local university in Adelaide. He finally enrolled as a full-time college student at Flinders when he was 14, two years after he would have graduated had his parents pushed him only according to his academic abilities.
 The Taos had different challenges in raising their other two sons, although all three excelled in math. Trevor, two years younger than Terry, is autistic with top-level chess skills and the musical savant gift to play back on the piano a musical piece -- even one played by an entire orchestra -- after hearing it just once. He completed a Ph.D. in mathematics and now works for the Defense Science and Technology Organization in Australia. 
 The youngest, Nigel, told his father that he was ''not another Terry,'' and his parents let him learn at a less accelerated pace. Nigel, with degrees in economics, math and computer science, now works as a computer engineer for Google Australia.
 ''All along, we tend to emphasize the joy of learning,'' Billy Tao said. ''The fun is doing something, not winning something.''
 Terry completed his undergraduate degree in two years, earned a master's degree a year after that, then moved to Princeton for his doctoral studies. While he said he never felt out of place in a class of much older students, Princeton was where he finally felt he fit among a group of peers. He was still younger, but was not necessarily the brightest student all the time.
 His attitude toward math also matured. Until then, math had been competitions, problem sets, exams. ''That's more like a sprint,'' he said. 
 Dr. Tao recalled that as a child, ''I remember having this vague idea that what mathematicians did was that, some authority, someone gave them problems to solve and they just sort of solved them.''
 In the real academic world, ''Math research is more like a marathon,'' he said.
 As a parent and a professor, Dr. Tao now has to think about how to teach math in addition to learning it.
 An evening snack provided him an opportunity to question his son, who is 4. If there are 10 cookies, how many does each of the five people in the living room get?
 William asked his father to tell him. ''I don't know how many,'' Dr. Tao replied. ''You tell me.''
 With a little more prodding, William divided the cookies into five stacks of two each.
 Dr. Tao said a future project would be to try to teach more non-mathematicians how to think mathematically -- a skill that would be useful in everyday tasks like comparing mortgages. 
 ''I believe you can teach this to almost anybody,'' he said.
 But for now, his research is where his focus is. 
 ''In many ways, my work is my hobby,'' he said. ''I always wanted to learn another language, but that's not going to happen for a while. Those things can wait.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 14, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A profile of Terence Tao, a world-renowned mathematician, in Science Times yesterday referred incorrectly to work he did with another mathematician on prime numbers. They proved that it is always possible to find, somewhere in the infinity of integers, a progression of any length of equally spaced prime numbers -- not a progression of prime numbers of any spacing and any length.

 FAN CLUB -- Terence Tao signing autographs after a lecture at U.C.L.A. (Photo by Monica Almeida/The New York Times)(pg. F4)Chart: ''8 Out of 8 (and Not Yet 8)''On July 16, 1983, a day before Terence Tao's eighth birthday, Ken Clements, an expert on the education of mathematically gifted children, visited the boy's home to evaluate his abilities. As part of the evaluation, he gave Terry the following set of written questions. Terry answered orally, without writing anything down. All his answers were correct.QUESTIONSTwo circles have a radii equal to 2 cm and 3 cm. The distance between their centers is 4 cm. Do they intersect?TERRY'S RESPONSESYes. If they didn't intersect, the distance between their centers would be more than 5.QUESTIONSWhat angle does an hour hand describe in 20 minutes?TERRY'S RESPONSESSimple. 1/3 of 1/12 of a full circle is 1/36th of a circle. 1/36th of 360degrees equals 10degrees.QUESTIONSA can of kerosene weighs 8 kg. Half of the kerosene is poured out of it, after which the can weighs 41/2 kg. What is the weight of the empty can?TERRY'S RESPONSESYou get an algebraic equation, but it's hard to work out in your head. Weight of can + weight of kero = 8. Weight of can + 1/2(weight of kero)= 41/2. So, weight of kero = 7 kg. Weight of can = 1 kg.QUESTIONSWhat time is it now if the time which passed since noon constitutes a third of the time that remains until midnight?TERRY'S RESPONSES1 unit + 3 units = 12 hours. So 1 unit = 3 hours. So time is 3 p.m.QUESTIONSI walk from home to school in 30 minutes and my brother takes 40 minutes. My brother left 5 minutes before I did. In how many minutes will I overtake him?TERRY'S RESPONSES35 minutes. If you started at the same time as your brother you'd arrive 10 minutes before him . . . Oh no. 15 minutes, because then you'd both be halfway.QUESTIONSThe perimeter of a right-angled triangle is 5 cm. Two of its sides are each 2 cm long. How long is the third side?TERRY'S RESPONSESThe third side is 1 cm . . . That can't be true, by the way. Pythagoras' theorem says it has to be . . . v8 or . . . It's impossible.QUESTIONSHow many triangles are there?TERRY'S RESPONSES8 triangles.QUESTIONSA class received some regular and some special notebooks, and altogether there were 80 notebooks. A regular notebook costs 20 cents and a special one10 cents. How many of each kind of notebook did the class receive?TERRY'S RESPONSESI don't know, really (laughs). r + s = 80 All you're given is the cost. It can't be done. Could be 40 regulars and 40 specials, or 50 regulars and 30 specials.(pg. F4)

HEADLINE: State Monitor Finds TXU Abused Texas Power Market

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Tex., March 12 

 BODY:
The TXU Corporation manipulated the Texas electric market in 2005, costing consumers $70 million and giving the utility $20 million in extra profits, according to an outside expert whose report was released by state regulators on Monday. 
 TXU, the largest power generator in Texas, sold power to the market at inflated prices and caused electricity prices to rise 15.5 percent during a four-month summer stretch, the market expert said.
Staff members of the state Public Utility Commission said the expert had concluded that the utility's behavior ''constitutes market power abuse.'' The report, by Potomac Economics, further complicates TXU's pending $45 billion sale to a group of private investors.
 State Senator Troy Fraser, the Republican chairman of the Senate Business and Commerce Committee, has introduced a bill that would effectively force TXU to sell generating plants and another to let the utilities commission review the proposed sale. The latter measure was approved 9-0 by his committee.
 A TXU spokeswoman, Lisa Singleton, said the company, based in Dallas, was ''obviously disappointed'' in the findings of the market monitor.
 In another blow at TXU, United States Representative Joe Barton, the ranking Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, urged the utility's customers to switch to other electricity providers. ''In this proposed buyout, nobody is looking out for the ratepayer, and I mean nobody,'' Mr. Barton said.
 A group of investors led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Texas Pacific Group agreed last month to buy TXU in the biggest leveraged buyout ever. The buyers would borrow $24.6 billion against TXU to finance the deal.
 In addition to cutting rates, the buyers promised to drop plans for 8 of 11 coal-burning power plants that TXU had proposed. Environmentalists had opposed the coal-fired plants and are now divided over whether to oppose the three plants that remain in the plan.

HEADLINE: Study Says Computers Give Big Boosts to Productivity

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Money spent on computing technology delivers gains in worker productivity that are three to five times those of other investments, according to a study being published today. But the study also concluded that the information technology industry itself was unlikely to be a big source of new jobs.
 The 69-page report is a wide-ranging look at the role that information technology plays in the economy, based on an assessment of existing research and the authors' analysis. The study was done by a year-old research organization, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, whose work is supported by companies like I.B.M., Cisco Systems and eBay, as well as by the Communications Workers of America and foundation grants. It will be available at www.itif.org. 
The study concludes that the economic significance of information technology is less in the technology itself than in the capacity of computer hardware, software and services to transform other sectors of the economy.
 Policy, according to the study, should focus less on incentives to use certain technology products or help particular companies than on encouraging market forces to hasten the pace of technology-aided change in industries. 
 In an interview, Robert D. Atkinson, the foundation president, cited health care, electric utilities and transportation as sectors that computing technology could benefit. 
 In health care, for example, the federal government has prodded industry to set standards for sharing patient and treatment information, as a step toward building a national health information network. Medicare and industry groups are moving to require hospitals and clinics to measure and report their performance in meeting safety standards and in patient health goals. To meet those standards, health care providers must increasingly adopt modern computing tools.
 ''The policy issue is how do you get digital transformation in these other sectors,'' Mr. Atkinson said. ''This is not about tax breaks for I.B.M. or Cisco or other technology companies.''
 Mr. Atkinson, a former project director at the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, most recently headed the technology policy program at the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic research organization. 
 The report notes that employment in computing has recovered somewhat, after falling sharply after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, to account for 3.76 million jobs. Still, it says, the growth potential is limited.
 ''Going forward,'' the report states, ''it is unlikely that the I.T. industry will be producing jobs gains out of line with its size. In part this is because productivity in the I.T. industry itself has been strong, allowing it to produce more output with fewer workers.''
 Instead, the report contends, job gains will more and more come from industries that use information technology intelligently, just as in the 19th century employment in the railroad industry leveled off but development of a transportation network led to the rise of national retailers and other new industries.
 The services sector, which employs 80 percent of the American work force, is expected to generate most of the new jobs in the future. 
 The most provocative and controversial parts of the report, ''Digital Prosperity: Understanding the Economic Benefits of the Information Technology Revolution,'' are its claim of extraordinary productivity gains from investments in computing technology and its policy focus on industry sectors.
 The report cites studies to back its assertion of outsize productivity benefits, but many economists are not convinced. ''It could be that investments here pay off more than other investments, but the evidence is still not in, in my view,'' said Robert E. Litan, an economist and director of research and policy at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.
 Economists also tend to be skeptical of industry-sector policies because they are reminiscent of industrial policy initiatives in Europe and elsewhere in the postwar years that are widely seen as costly failures. ''I am far more sympathetic with promoting investment in general,'' Mr. Litan said, ''and letting the chips -- pun intended -- fall where they may.''

FLYERTALK.COM SOLD -- FlyerTalk.com, the Web site with scores of vibrant forums on frequent-flier programs, loyalty points and travel, has been sold to Internet Brands by Randy Petersen, who founded the site almost nine years ago. Mr. Petersen will continue as a consultant for four years. 
In e-mail messages to members and to site moderators, Mr. Petersen said he decided to sell only after ''plenty of sleepless nights.'' Other travel companies that had expressed interest, he said, included American Express, Expedia, Travelocity and Conde Nast Interactive. Internet Brands operates e-commerce sites for cars, real estate, mortgages and travel. Mr. Petersen said he chose Internet Brands, which was not the highest bidder, because ''they weren't interested in making any changes'' to FlyerTalk.com. NEW FINANCING FOR DAYJET -- DayJet, which plans to start regional on-demand air taxi service in Florida and the Southeast this spring, said it received $50 million in new private equity financing. DayJet will sell seats on demand for ''air taxi'' services on routes of 300 to 600 miles, using new Eclipse 500 very light jets. Other competitors are expected to enter the air taxi business.MIDSIZE IS IN -- Of the estimated 11,000 new commercial jetliners that will be added to global fleets over the next 10 years, more than a third will be new-model ''mainline cabin'' planes with standard-size cabins of 75 to 125 seats, according to the Boyd Group's annual Global Fleet Demand and Trend Forecast. Half of all new planes will be replacements for older aircraft being retired. The new mainline cabin airliners, like the Embraer E190 and E195 models, which seat 98 and 108 passengers respectively, are classified in a niche between small cabin-size regional jets and standard commercial airline workhorses. The Boyd forecast also said that demand for small-cabin regional jets ''will taper off to almost zero by 2012'' because they are not as economical to operate as the new models and their cabins are cramped.ET CETERA -- Extended-stay hotels posted a 9.9 percent increase in average room rates last year, according to the Highland Group. The leader in the category is Extended Stay Hotels, which owns and operates more than 680 hotels in North America Looking to move a portion of its fleet north with the snowbirds, Budget Rent A Car announced special one-way rates, starting at $12.95 a day with unlimited mileage, from Florida to select locations in the United States Continental Airlines raised its order for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft to 25 from 20, saying the 787s offer low operating costs and the ability to add more capacity on international routes.

HEADLINE: Knicks Rediscover Mediocrity, And Coach Basks in the Glory

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON. 
E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Greenburgh, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Isiah Thomas shook hands with some of his many news media tormentors yesterday, accepting congratulations all around. Experience told him the truce was temporary and wouldn't last long.
 He was nonetheless grateful to breathe the mild mid-March air, bask in the fresh job security that provides him the opportunity to continue in these fragile and, chances are, doomed relationships.
 ''It's a sick part of me,'' he said. ''Something about me that draws me to that, that wants to do it, put up with the torture that comes along with New York.'' 
 Thomas has always cast himself as an embattled survivor of mean streets, of long odds for an undersized overachiever in the land of the giants. Now he has slipped the posse of critics that not so long ago seemed to have him on the run, out of town -- at least for the foreseeable future.
 History tells us that the Knicks and their minions eventually get the best of the well-paid mercenaries who dare to lead them. Nobody escapes the fact that there hasn't been an N.B.A. champion in New York for 33 years. But Thomas, playing by rules adjusted this season for serious deflation, was rewarded yesterday for merely making the Knicks functional again, and fun. 
 Not great. Not even good, by most reasonable standards. Just not bad -- or what they were last season, an embarrassment. 
 ''They look like a team, playing for each other,'' James L. Dolan, the Madison Square Garden strongman, said in explaining why he handed Thomas, the coach and team president, a multiyear contract extension of undisclosed length two months short of the time he said he would decide Thomas's fate. 
 That's Dolan, once again proving himself to be a premature negotiator, getting ahead of himself when all he had to do was announce that Thomas would return next season. He's earned that much. 
 From mid-December on, from Stephon Marbury's length-of-the-floor dash to beat the Utah Jazz, the season has been a blur of wild, inelegant battles to the buzzer, three months worth of March Madness. The Garden crowds have been enthusiastic, alive. Thomas's team clearly crossed a competitive threshold some time ago, and just enough Eastern Conference teams have more recently gone into free fall to help the Knicks become the N.B.A. version of the lovable midmajor, making a push for the right to dream big, dance with the stars. 
 ''If we get in, I want it all, not just a little piece of it,'' Thomas said, while sitting a precarious eighth in the East, a half-game out of seventh, thinking along with the rest of us how beatable teams like Cleveland and Washington could be if the Knicks move up and avoid playing Detroit. 
 The bad news is that Jamal Crawford is out for the regular season, David Lee spent yesterday looking for a second opinion on his aching ankle, and it is entirely possible that the Knicks could lose a bunch and drop out of sight. That said, only those still feeding Larry Brown his bedtime milk and cookies would argue now that Coach Isiah hasn't cleaned up much of the mess Brown made of the Knicks last season.
 But let's not forget it was Thomas who hired Brown, which might be his costliest move for the franchise during three-plus years on the job, and certainly was for the Dolan family fortune. On a personal level, it turns out now that Brown was the best thing ever to happen to Thomas. By restoring normalcy -- or, if you will, mediocrity -- after Brown's 23-victory disaster, Thomas has guaranteed himself more money and a 2007-8 season without an ''evident progress'' mandate hanging over his head.
 ''I believe I earned it,'' Thomas said. ''I haven't been gifted anything.''
 How about the benefit of the doubt that he has the Knicks as currently constituted heading in the direction of the conference elite? When the evaluation process is expanded beyond the leap from last season to, well, five games under .500, it's not quite clear where the Knicks are going, if anywhere, beyond the possibility of the first round of the playoffs.
 As this season has evolved, there is no doubt that several of Thomas's personnel moves have been cast in a more favorable (if not completely justifiable) light. Eddy Curry has become an offensive force on the low post. Marbury has resurrected himself under Thomas's mentorship. Before he was hurt, Crawford became a big-shot maker, however ditzy his overall game. Lee has proved himself to be a 2005 draft-night heist.
 Curry and Marbury stayed around after practice yesterday to express their delight over Thomas's new deal, to say the Knicks now have everything they need to continue the climb. Thomas talked about the need for collective growth, about nurturing another All-Star to play alongside Curry.
 Except Curry, a genuine low-post force, had too many flaws in other phases of the game and wasn't selected as an All-Star this season. Unless Thomas can teach energy and high basketball I.Q., Curry may never be one. For all their progress, the Knicks remain a team without that one player you build around without blinking.
 And what if they should plateau next season, win between 35 and 40 games again? What would that say about the totality of the Thomas regime after four and a half years? That he built one that was not bad, not embarrassing? 
 Even in that place of paranoia we call the Garden, it has been apparent for several weeks that the bar wasn't raised all that high. It didn't have to be for Thomas to fulfill this season's demand.
 His players responded. He's coached well. But even Thomas said yesterday that they all ''have a long way to go.'' The mandate for ''evident progress'' should have gone with them, into next season.

HEADLINE: Tales of Desperation In the Middle East

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Years of Strife and Lost Hope Scar Young Palestinian Lives'' (''A Generation Lost,'' front page, March 12): 
 I read the stories of young Palestinians desperate for a different future with tears in my eyes. Not only for youths living lives without hope, but for myself, a recent immigrant to Israel, and Israel's next generation.
Clearly, peace in our lifetime is an idea too foreign to become reality. And the bulk of the problem was epitomized by the Abu Rish brigades fighter, who talked about ''willing my children to be martyrs for Allah,'' though he honestly wishes for them to be ''safe and healthy.'' 
 If that's his true wish, why is he talking about martyrdom? Why is he a member of a fighting brigade? Does he think that his children will not notice his actions or hear his words? 
 Why did Palestinian parents vote for Hamas, which teaches violence? Their actions seem antithetical to what they claim that they want, and if they continue to talk of and teach violence, a life of ''safety'' and ''health'' will seem all the more out of reach.Naomi LipsteinJerusalem, March 12, 2007To the Editor:
 Your article about the condition of Palestinian youth shook me to my core. I cannot imagine anybody on this earth who can raise healthy children in such an environment.
 At one point, we as Americans must put aside all of the political rhetoric and propaganda that we have been fed and look at this situation from a humanitarian point of view. If we truly believe in peace, then we must work to relieve the suffocation of the Palestinians. 
 If we believe that peace can be attained by dehumanizing them and by rejecting their rights to dignity and liberty, then we are very wrong. 
 Perhaps we must start actually believing in liberty and justice for all. As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, ''True peace is not merely the absence of tension: it is the presence of justice.''Ghayth AdhamiNew York, March 12, 2007To the Editor: 
 Your article addresses an essential barrier to peace negotiations in Israel-Palestine: until Israel grants Palestinians their rights to freedom of movement, engagement in the economy and access to health care and education, the sense of hopelessness and despair among the overwhelming number of Palestinian youth in the occupied territories will only grow and push more toward acts of desperation. 
 Despite criticism, Israel claims that its construction of the separation barrier, in addition to hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints, is necessary to ensure its security. Such dehumanizing measures cause only further humiliation and indignity, and thus worsen the unrest between Palestinians and Israelis, and among Palestinians themselves. 
 If a just and lasting peace is to be achieved in Israel-Palestine, its roots will not be formed at a negotiation table but in the freedom that allows all Palestinians to exercise their human rights and lead productive, secure and dignified lives, and allows the younger generation to hope for a better future.Elizabeth ArendDire Dawa, EthiopiaMarch 12, 2007

HEADLINE: U.N. Mission Says Sudan Took Part in Rights Crimes

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 12 

 BODY:
A United Nations Human Rights Council mission to Darfur said Monday that the Sudanese government had organized and taken part in human rights crimes against its own population, and that international action to stop the killings and rapes had been inadequate.
 The government in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, ''has manifestly failed to protect the population of Darfur from large-scale international crimes and has itself orchestrated and participated in these crimes,'' the mission's 35-page report said. It added that rebels were also to blame for abuses, including the rape and torture of civilians. 
 The mission's report urged that all resolutions from the United Nations Security Council and the African Union be put into effect, ''including those relating to travel bans and the freezing of funds, assets, and economic resources of those who commit violations.''
 Human rights advocates welcomed the unusually tough tone of the report and its recommendations, but they warned that steps were already under way to block its effect when the report comes up for adoption by the Human Rights Council on Friday in Geneva.
 The rights council has been widely criticized for being no more effective than the discredited Human Rights Commission it replaced this year. Taking action on Darfur is seen by rights groups as a measure of whether the council can start to build credibility during its formal session, the fourth it has held, which began Monday.
 So far, all eight of the condemnations of human rights performance it has issued since its creation in June have been against one country, Israel.
 The mission to Darfur, led by Jody Williams, an American campaigner against land mines and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was denied entry to Sudan by the government, and had to base its report on interviews with refugees and aid workers, rebels across the border in Chad and officials of the African Union at its headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
 ''This report is Jody Williams and her team members, and this is definitely not the council,'' said Hillel Neuer, executive director of U.N. Watch, an organization based in Geneva that monitors United Nations activities. ''The council will probably throw this report into Lake Geneva.''
 Reached at her home in Virginia, Ms. Williams said, ''Given the hostility to the mission almost from the moment it was born, I would not be shocked if there were maneuvers not to allow the report to be presented.''
 She said she was traveling to Geneva this week to lobby for the report's adoption. ''But I understand there has already been tabled a resolution to try to block the presentation of this report and call for a new quote, unquote balanced and objective mission,'' she said.
 The original decision to send the six-person team to Sudan was made only after a bitter debate among council members, with some Arab and African countries on the 47-member group protesting the singling out of Sudan.
 Commenting on that, Ms. Williams said: ''The most difficult part of this mission was not the travel or the worry about getting visas for Darfur, nor the interviewing of refugees and listening to 5 women out of 20 in the space of an hour about being gang-raped. It was dealing with the politics of the Human Rights Council from the minute I received the call.''
 Peter G. Splinter, the Amnesty International representative in Geneva, said: ''Although there is considerable pessimism here, there are a number of key diplomats who view this as a test of the council's credibility, and no one has any illusions about Sudan and the seriousness of the matter. So maybe the council can still do something substantive on Darfur.''
 But he added, ''It's still an uphill battle.''

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New Jersey: Trenton: Proposal On Companies Dealing With Iran

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS; Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
An Assembly committee approved a measure yesterday that would bar the state's pension funds from investing in any foreign company with ties to or doing work in Iran. Citing the Iranian regime's harsh denunciations of Israel, the bill's sponsor, Assemblyman Neil M. Cohen, a Democrat of Union, said the measure would also require the divestment of securities in any such company to send a message that New Jersey had no support for ''the Holocaust-like genocide'' embodied in statements by Iranian leaders.

HEADLINE: City Hopes to Fix a Staten Island Railroad Bridge That Could, but Now Can't

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
A gap of less than a foot stands between the city and its goal of rejuvenating rail freight traffic between Staten Island and the rest of the country. 
 The snag has come in the renovation of an old lift bridge spanning the Arthur Kill between Staten Island and New Jersey. The span has gotten stuck during tests of its rehabilitated lifting mechanism, tilting it out of place by as much as 11 inches.
Without the bridge, trains cannot come and go. So after years of planning and hundreds of millions of dollars of public investment, the city is hoping that a specialist being brought in can fix it. 
 ''Given that the Arthur Kill Lift Bridge has been inactive for a decade, we're testing it thoroughly,'' said Joan McDonald, the senior vice president for transportation at the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which owns the span. The testing will continue ''until all parties are comfortable and we can be assured of a safe and successful reactivation,'' she said.
 The bridge -- nearly a half-century old and almost two football fields long -- is the longest lift bridge in the country. But now when the bridge's movable platform is raised and then lowered back into the down position, it sometimes does not dock perfectly into the deck. 
 The Economic Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have finished rebuilding rail lines at Howland Hook on the northwest corner of Staten Island and at the nearby Arlington Yards, as well as a seven-mile rail line to a trash transfer station, and rail connections on the New Jersey side of Arthur Kill. 
 The entire rail link was originally scheduled to open last fall. If delays continue for many more months, the city's goal of generating more than $200 million in net economic benefits by 2010 by reactivating rail service could be jeopardized. The rail link over the Arthur Kill Lift Bridge is also important to the city's hopes of reducing truck traffic. 
 For now, the New York Container Terminal, the port operator at Howland Hook, is unable to start shipping containers by train, a linchpin of its expansion plans.
 And the city continues to haul trash from the Staten Island Transfer Station to a rail depot in New Jersey by truck, which can be more expensive than by rail. Trash is brought to the $40 million transfer station from around Staten Island, where it is compacted and put in containers that hold about 20 tons of waste, or about two truckloads worth of trash. 
 The city is paying about $93 a ton to a private operator to take the trash to New Jersey, according to Harry Szarpanski, the city's assistant sanitation commissioner for long-term export. 
 When the rail link opens, a train would make one round trip a day over the lift bridge six days a week. 
 Several more train trips may be added because the New York Container Terminal is eager to offer its customers the option of shipping by rail. Container traffic at the port grew 15 percent last year, and growth is expected to continue because the harbor is being dredged to accommodate larger ships. 
 ''There's a lot at stake for everyone,'' said Jim Devine, chief executive of the container terminal. ''We've been waiting a while, but we know it's coming, our customers know it's coming and the rail people know it's coming.''

HEADLINE: Halliburton Office Move Is Criticized

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: HOUSTON, March 12 

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and other leading Congressional Democrats sharply criticized Halliburton on Monday for relocating its chief executive to Dubai, suggesting it was possibly part of an effort to dodge American taxes and investigations.
 Halliburton, an oil services company based here, said it would remain legally incorporated in the United States, and that the transfer of David J. Lesar, its chairman and chief executive, was merely a response to the growing business opportunities in the Middle East and nearby areas.
But that did not stop many powerful Democrats from expressing skepticism about the motives behind the move, arguing that it may presage a wholesale move of Halliburton's corporate headquarters out of the United States and not merely for business reasons. 
 They vowed to hold hearings on the matter and jumped at the opportunity to link the move to Vice President Dick Cheney, who led the company from 1995 to 2000. They also sought to revive charges that the company mishandled, through its military contracting subsidiary, hundreds of millions of tax dollars in Iraq.
 ''I think it's disgraceful,'' Senator Clinton, who is running for president, told a news conference in the Bronx, ''that American companies are more than happy to try to get no-bid contracts, like Halliburton has, and then turn around and say, 'But you know, we're not going to stay with our chief executive officer, the president of our company, in the United States anymore.' ''
 Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, added: ''I want to know, is Halliburton trying to run away from bad publicity on their contracts?'' 
 Wall Street analysts said any tax implications of the move are unclear, especially since Halliburton will continue to have a large corporate office in Houston and will remain one of the leading oil services companies in North America. It also was not clear the extent to which Mr. Lesar would gain any personal tax benefits by moving to Dubai. 
 Melissa Norcross, Halliburton's manager of public relations, strongly disputed the charges of Congressional Democrats in an e-mail message.
 ''These assumptions and suppositions are absolutely untrue and unfounded,'' she wrote. ''Halliburton is, and will remain, a U.S. corporation, incorporated in Delaware, with its principal executive office in Houston, Tex. As such we anticipate absolutely no tax benefits from this decision.''
 She stressed that while Mr. Lesar was moving to Dubai, ''all other executive officers reside in Houston with no plans for relocating outside of the United States.''
 An aide to Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the Democratic chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said that Mr. Waxman was ''thinking about and likely'' would hold hearings on the tax and investigative implications of the move. 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said, ''This is a company that has been under unfavorable scrutiny and this will increase that fivefold, so why would they do it?'' 
 Mr. Schumer predicted that Congress would take a hard look at the move, adding: ''What kind of tax or regulatory laws are they trying to circumvent? They didn't just do this on a whim. They could easily focus more on the Middle East without doing this kind of change.'' 
 The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the company over allegations of improper dealings in Kuwait and Nigeria as well as Iraq. 
 In her e-mail message, Ms. Norcross stressed that Halliburton's work in support of government programs in the Middle East is being performed by its KBR unit, which is being spun off as a separate entity.
 ''Halliburton will continue to be forthcoming with information regarding KBR's 60-year history of work for the U.S. military,'' she wrote. ''Halliburton and KBR are complying with numerous requests for information and look forward to providing facts regarding KBR's work as Congress fulfills their important oversight responsibilities.'' 
 Halliburton has been the Pentagon's largest private contractor in Iraq and a lightning rod for criticism of the Bush administration's failures in prosecuting the war. It has been subject to a variety of investigations over suspicions it mishandled billions of dollars in contracts to build bases, serve food and provide other support to the American presence since the invasion in 2003.
 The harshest criticism so far has come from Senator Clinton at her news conference. 
 ''Does this mean they're going to quit paying taxes in America?'' she asked. ''Is this going to affect the investigations that are going on? Because we have a lot of evidence about their misuse of government contracts and how they have cheated the American soldier, cheated the American taxpayer. They have taken money and not provided the services.'' 
 Many Wall Street analysts and economists said Halliburton's move, while unusual, made some sense from a business standpoint since most future energy drilling and construction activity would take place in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
 ''Expect more oil-related companies to do the same,'' said A. F. Alhajji, an energy economist at Ohio Northern University in Ada, Ohio. ''Dubai is the most dynamic, vibrant and globalized city in the world.''

HEADLINE: In Mexico, Bush Seeks to Bolster Uneasy Alliance

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: MERIDA, Mexico, March 12 

 BODY:
Just a few days before President Bush was scheduled to land here on Monday for bilateral talks, the Mexican Foreign Ministry sent an angry diplomatic note to the United States. 
 The note complained that United States Border Patrol agents had crossed the border and ventured a couple of dozen feet into Mexico to put out a rapidly spreading brush fire. ''Even in emergency situations, the Mexican authorities must be notified immediately, without exception,'' the note said.
The incident illustrates just how touchy relations have become between the United States and Mexico during Mr. Bush's presidency and hints at the difficulty the American president faces as he tries on this state visit to revive what many Mexicans see as a moribund partnership. 
 In large measure, the relationship has stagnated in recent years as Mr. Bush has failed to deliver on a promise of changing immigration laws to allow more guest workers, while conservatives in his party have pushed through tougher measures to control the border, among them a giant wall. 
 Anti-American sentiment runs high here, with more than half of 1,000 people surveyed in a recent BBC poll saying they viewed the United States' influence in the world as mainly negative. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percent.
 ''A lot of what my president will be looking for in Merida is a renewed sense of purpose,'' said one high-ranking Mexican diplomat. 
 That frustration was evident as dozens of protesters marched down one of the main avenues of this tropical city Monday evening, before Mr. Bush arrived, waving banners depicting him as an imperialist. Mr. Bush's plane landed at 9:10 p.m. and he went to the Hyatt Regency hotel, where he is expected to spend two nights.
 For the United States, there is more at stake in the talks with President Felipe Calderon, a conservative free-trade advocate, than possible progress on an age-old list of frictions between the neighbors: drug trafficking, trade barriers, border security and illegal migration. 
 Also in play is whether Mr. Calderon is willing or able to become a pro-American counterweight to Hugo Chavez, the left-wing populist leader of Venezuela who is using his country's oil wealth to undermine American influence in Latin America.
 For political reasons, however, Mr. Calderon has been reluctant to become the anti-Chavez standard-bearer in public. He said in a recent interview with The Associated Press, ''I am not interested in playing a role with Bush in that respect.'' 
 His aides say he wants to mend fences with the United States' antagonists, Cuba and Venezuela, as well as with the rest of Latin America. ''The United States has a lot to do to regain respect in Latin America,'' he said.
 Still, Mr. Calderon remains the best candidate the United States has for a strong ally in Latin America. Gordon D. Johndroe, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said the main purpose of Mr. Bush's visit to Mexico was ''to show support and confidence in the agenda that President Calderon has laid out.''
 ''He's certainly an important regional leader who is making the right policy choices,'' Mr. Johndroe said. 
 One trouble for Mr. Bush is that he is a lame-duck president facing an opposition-controlled Congress. He seems to have little to offer Mr. Calderon beyond a handshake and a photo in front of Mayan ruins, political analysts say. 
 The Mexican president would dearly love to see a comprehensive immigration bill passed that would allow more migrants to work temporarily in the United States and would offer citizenship to many of the 6.4 million illegal workers already there. It is unlikely that Mr. Bush can deliver on that now, given the divisions within his own party on the issue and the approaching presidential election, political analysts say.
 ''Bush could have done something to buttress Calderon, but he's going to arrive with empty hands,'' said Miguel Tinker-Salas, a professor of international affairs at Pomona College in California.
 President Bush has said he still believes he can push an immigration bill through Congress, working with both parties. 
 Mexicans had high hopes of a better relationship when Mr. Bush, a former Texas governor, was elected in 2000, as he promised to push through an immigration-reform bill. 
 But those initial hopes have soured over the past six years. Mr. Bush and the United States Congress not only did nothing to legalize millions of illegal Mexican immigrants, but took strong actions after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to strengthen security along the 2,000-mile border. A result has been more walls and barriers. 
 Particularly irksome for Mexicans is Congress's decision last year to approve a 700-mile wall. It has left many Mexican politicians and intellectuals wondering what it is the United States president wants.
 ''I don't know what his aim is,'' said Senator Ricardo Garcia Cervantes in an interview with the newspaper Reforma this weekend. ''What I believe is that there isn't a lot of interest in Latin America.''
 Like other Latin Americans, many Mexicans have also grown tired of the free-trade policies that were trumpeted in the 1990s as the solution to their economic ills. That sentiment was so strong among the country's poor that voters came within a hairsbreadth last year of electing a left-wing populist, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. 
 Now Mr. Calderon has to convince the two-thirds of Mexicans who voted for other parties that staying the course on free trade and remaining a close United States ally will work to alleviate poverty, political analysts say.
 Since taking office in December, Mr. Calderon has taken several steps aimed in part at showing Washington he is a willing partner on security and immigration issues. 
 He has cracked down on drug cartels, breaking tradition to ship 11 top-level drug dealers to the United States for prosecution. He has also sent thousands of police officers and soldiers to restore order in several states where warring drug cartels had killed hundreds of people, among them dozens of police officers.
 In late February, he also announced plans to create a guest-worker program for Central American migrants on Mexico's southern border, decriminalize illegal entry and improve the treatment of illegal migrants. It escaped no one's notice that the proposals are precisely what Mr. Calderon is seeking from the United States.
 Mr. Bush, meanwhile, ruffled a lot of feathers when he suggested in an interview with Reforma that the state-owned oil monopoly should be opened to private investment so it could explore deeper waters for crude. 
 Selling off all or part of the state monopoly, or even allowing private investment in it, is a political land mine here that even the most ardent free-trade conservatives like Mr. Calderon are not willing to step near. The interior minister immediately squelched speculation that the new president would consider the idea, but the leftist leader, Mr. Lopez Obrador, leapt on it, saying ''one doesn't sell the fatherland.'' 
 Beyond help with changing United States immigration laws, Mr. Calderon is likely to bring up the possibility of tinkering with the North American Free Trade Agreement to protect farmers who produce corn and beans. 
 He is also likely to suggest expanding the role of a development bank created under the 13-year-old accord so it can finance projects in southern Mexico. For a year, as a candidate and now president, Mr. Calderon's mantra has been that the solution to illegal migration is to attract more investment to Mexico; expanding the bank's role is one small way to do that, his aides say.
 Other issues likely to come up are the steady flow of arms from the United States into Mexico as well as the skyrocketing cost of American corn because of new ethanol plants.
 Mr. Bush is likely to seek a continuation of the strong diplomatic support the United States enjoyed from the previous administration, that of President Vicente Fox. Mr. Fox backed the United States to the hilt in its feuds with Mr. Chavez and its attempt to create a free trade zone throughout the Americas.
 But some Mexican political leaders and opinion makers are now expressing the belief that Mr. Bush does not understand the depth of anti-American sentiment, nor the prospects for a left-wing populist taking over here in the near future, as nearly happened last year. 
 Some are talking about a need for greater United States assistance to help Mr. Calderon make the free-trade model work to alleviate poverty.
 Rossana Fuentes-Berain, the opinion page editor for the newspaper El Universal, points out that more than half the country survives on $4 a day. With help, she says, Mexico could go the route of Portugal and become prosperous in a short time. Without it, Mexico might begin to resemble Pakistan, she said.
 ''We must be honest, there are a lot of predators that are rooting for President Felipe Calderon's presidency to go sour,'' she said. ''They will come back with an 'I told you so' story, with a 'free markets don't work for us' tale, with 'throw the baby out with the water' advice. 'Let us build the anti-American wall ourselves,' they will say. And people will listen.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Voters Voice Anxieties On Party's Fate

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and MEGAN THEE; Marjorie Connelly and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After years of political dominance, Republican voters now view their party as divided and say they are not satisfied with the choice of candidates seeking the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 In a survey that brought to life the party's anxieties about keeping the White House, Republicans said they were concerned that their party had drifted from the principles of Ronald Reagan, its most popular figure of the past 50 years.
 Forty percent of Republicans said they expected Democrats to take control of the White House next year, compared with 46 percent who said they believed a Republican would win. Just 12 percent of Democrats said they thought the opposing party would win the White House.
 Even as Republican voters continued to support President Bush and the war in Iraq, including the recent increase in the number of American troops deployed there, they said a candidate who backed Mr. Bush's war policies would be at a decided disadvantage in 2008. And they suggested that they were open to supporting a candidate who broke with the president on a crucial aspect of his Iraq strategy. 
 Asked what was more important to them in a nominee, a commitment to stay in Iraq until the United States succeeds or flexibility about when to withdraw, 58 percent of self-identified Republican primary voters said flexibility versus 39 percent who said a commitment to stay. The three leading Republican candidates are strong supporters of the war and the increase in American troops there.
 The poll, which was designed to survey more Republicans than it normally would to provide a better statistical look at the mood of the party, found signs that members were uneasy about its future. 
 ''There is going to be so much antiwar in the news media that there is no way the Republicans are going to win,'' Randy Miller, 54, a Republican from Kansas, said in a follow-up interview after participating in the poll. ''The Democrats will win because of the war. I think the Republicans just won't vote.''
 Compared with the Democrats, Republicans appear far less happy with their choice of candidates for 2008 and are still looking for someone who can improve the party's prospects, the poll found.
 While nearly 6 in 10 Democratic voters in the poll said they were satisfied with the candidates now in the race for their party's nomination, nearly 6 in 10 Republicans said they wanted more choices. Yet the poll found that a substantial number of Republicans did not know enough about their leading contenders -- Senator John McCain of Arizona; Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York; and Mitt Romney, former governor of Massachusetts -- to offer an opinion of them.
 ''I think the Republican candidate has not appeared yet,'' said Richard Gerrish, 69, a Republican from Green-acres, Fla. ''The ones we have now will run out of steam. Someone will come along later that will do better.'' 
 For all that, the poll found that Republican voters remain largely loyal to Mr. Bush and his positions on the issues. Among Republicans, 75 percent approve of his job performance, and by overwhelming numbers they approve of his handling of foreign policy, the war in Iraq and the management of the economy. 
 Propelled by this Republican support, the poll registered an increase in the percentage of Americans who say they approve of Mr. Bush's performance; it has increased to 34 percent now from 29 percent last month.
 The poll highlights a Republican weakness going into next year's election. Just 34 percent of all respondents said they had a favorable view of the Republican Party, and that is the lowest it has been since December 1998. By contrast, 47 percent of respondents said they had a positive view of the Democratic Party. 
 And by a 20-point margin, respondents said that if the election were held today they would vote for an unnamed Democrat for president rather than a Republican. Such questions are hardly predictive of the outcome of an election so far away, but they do offer an insight into the health of the party today.
 Even as Republicans said they supported Mr. Bush's performance, they showed divisions over the party's ideological makeup; 39 percent of Republican voters said they wanted the next Republican presidential nominee to continue with Mr. Bush's policies; 19 percent said they wanted the next president to become less conservative, and 39 percent more conservative. 
 ''I think he's spending too much money,'' said Marjorie Bickel, a Republican from Indiana. ''The money's going to have to come from somewhere, and I think they'll raise the taxes and take the money out of Social Security, which they shouldn't.''
 Republican strategists said they were not surprised about the poll's findings, though they said Republicans were too pessimistic in concluding now that the party could not win in 2008.
 ''People should be concerned -- we've had a tough last year and a half or so,'' said Glenn Bolger, a Republican strategist. ''But if you go back in time to 1991, the Democrats had a lot of the same concerns, both about the candidates running and their possibility of winning. And it turned out pretty well for them.''
 The national telephone poll was conducted Wednesday through Sunday with 1,362 adults, including 698 Republicans. The margin of sampling error for all adults is plus or minus three percentage points and four percentage points for Republicans.
 The poll also found an increase in approval of the way Mr. Bush is managing the war in Iraq, to 28 percent from 23 percent, and how he is handling foreign policy. But at a time when the administration has come under fire for the way veterans from Iraq have been treated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, 76 percent of Americans, including 57 percent of Republicans, said the Bush White House had not done all it could to deal with the needs and problems facing returning military personnel.
 The poll suggested that opinions were still fluid about three of the leading Republican presidential contenders. Mr. Giuliani is the best known of the candidates, but 41 percent of Republicans said they had not formed an opinion of him; 50 percent said they had a favorable rating of him, compared with 9 percent with an unfavorable view of him.
 Fifty percent of Republicans said they did not know enough about Mr. McCain to offer a view on him or were undecided, even though he is running for president for a second time. Of the remainder, 32 percent said they had a favorable view of him, compared with 18 percent who said they had an unfavorable view.
 By a margin of 43 percent to 34 percent, Republican primary voters said they would prefer to see Mr. Giuliani win the nomination over Mr. McCain, but those kind of measurements taken this early in a campaign tend to be largely discounted by professional pollsters.
 Republican primary voters have a definite idea of what they are looking for in a candidate: They want a presidential contender who will make it more difficult for women to obtain abortions, who opposes same-sex marriage and who will push for more tax cuts, the poll found.
 The poll found that Republicans think it might be more difficult winning an election as a Mormon, which Mr. Romney is, than as a candidate who had gone through multiple divorces, a category that includes Mr. Giuliani and Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who is considering a run for president. 
 Thirty-nine percent of Republican voters thought Americans would not vote for someone with multiple divorces; by contrast, 51 percent of Republican voters thought that Americans would not vote fora Mormon. (Among the general electorate, 42 percent of respondents said Americans would not vote for someone who had been divorced more than once, and 53 percent said most people would not vote for a Mormon.)
 Republicans, the poll found, are satisfied, but not enthusiastic, with how Mr. Bush is handing the war in Iraq, taxes and abortion. They said they believed the United States was correct in entering Iraq in the first place, supported the troop escalation pushed by President Bush and believe the war is going well there now. 
 On an issue that has come to overshadow Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign to win the Democratic nomination, 52 percent of respondents said Mrs. Clinton had not made a mistake in voting to authorize the war in Iraq, compared with 41 percent who said it was a mistake.
 But among Democratic voters, 53 percent said she had made a mistake, underscoring the political problems the war has caused her. Mrs. Clinton has refused calls from Democrats to apologize for that vote; just 16 percent of respondents, and 21 percent of Democratic voters, said Mrs. Clinton should acknowledge publicly that the vote was a mistake.How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted March 7 through March 11 with 1,362 adults throughout the United States. 
 The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country. The exchanges were chosen to ensure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population.
 Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey. 
 For purposes of analysis, self-identified Republicans were oversampled in this poll. Phone numbers at which a self-identified Republican had been interviewed in polls over the last seven months were recalled and a random member of the household was interviewed. If that person was a Republican, he was included in the oversample. All Republicans were then weighted back to the party's usual proportion of identifiers in the poll, as determined by the average proportion in four polls taken since Jan. 1, 2007.
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, marital status, age and education.
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults. For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. For the 698 Republicans, for instance, it is plus or minus 4 points.
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: The Death of Geography?

 BODY:
A handshake can still trump a videoconference. The energy services giant Halliburton announced on Sunday that it will move its corporate headquarters and its chief executive, David Lesar, from the old boomtown of Houston (Texas) to the rising boomtown of Dubai (United Arab Emirates). The move sends the message that even in the new economy, some of the old rules still apply, including that location matters. 
 Halliburton's name will forever be linked in many Americans' minds to its former chief executive, Vice President Dick Cheney, and a $16 billion contract to support American military operations in Iraq, which has led to investigations into overbilling and the mishandling of taxpayer dollars. While Capitol Hill critics may not like the company, they don't want to see its back either. Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, called the move ''an insult to the U.S. soldiers and taxpayers who paid the tab for their no-bid contracts and endured their overcharges for all these years.''
 The company will remain incorporated in Delaware, other executive officers will stay put in Houston, and, the company insists, there will be no tax benefits from its move. Halliburton -- which is spinning off its embattled military contracting subsidiary -- says it wants to focus on energy. And as the saying goes, it's going where the oil is.
 That stands in conflict with the popular notion that the wired world has made geography irrelevant. But all the Blackberry devices and Internet phone calls in the world can't make up for in-person interactions. That's not just for old-economy companies like Halliburton either. Silicon Valley continues to act as a leading incubator for high-tech start-ups. Once you have a critical mass of software engineers and venture capitalists attending the same happy hours, a certain ferment takes place. News spreads fast in person, not just on MySpace. As a result, a city with a strong concentration of companies and a trained labor force -- like New York in finance -- can maintain its position within an industry. 
 That's no argument for complacency by policy makers. It is easy to imagine, for instance, that Halliburton might not have deemed this particular move necessary without the visa problems that visiting businesspeople have been having, particularly those with Muslim-sounding names.

HEADLINE: Whose Oil Is It, Anyway?

BYLINE: By Antonia Juhasz. 
Antonia Juhasz, an analyst with Oil Change International, a watchdog group, is the author of ''The Bush Agenda: Invading the World, One Economy at a Time.''

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
TODAY more than three-quarters of the world's oil is owned and controlled by governments. It wasn't always this way. 
 Until about 35 years ago, the world's oil was largely in the hands of seven corporations based in the United States and Europe. Those seven have since merged into four: ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP. They are among the world's largest and most powerful financial empires. But ever since they lost their exclusive control of the oil to the governments, the companies have been trying to get it back.
Iraq's oil reserves -- thought to be the second largest in the world -- have always been high on the corporate wish list. In 1998, Kenneth Derr, then chief executive of Chevron, told a San Francisco audience, ''Iraq possesses huge reserves of oil and gas -- reserves I'd love Chevron to have access to.'' 
 A new oil law set to go before the Iraqi Parliament this month would, if passed, go a long way toward helping the oil companies achieve their goal. The Iraq hydrocarbon law would take the majority of Iraq's oil out of the exclusive hands of the Iraqi government and open it to international oil companies for a generation or more.
 In March 2001, the National Energy Policy Development Group (better known as Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force), which included executives of America's largest energy companies, recommended that the United States government support initiatives by Middle Eastern countries ''to open up areas of their energy sectors to foreign investment.'' One invasion and a great deal of political engineering by the Bush administration later, this is exactly what the proposed Iraq oil law would achieve. It does so to the benefit of the companies, but to the great detriment of Iraq's economy, democracy and sovereignty.
 Since the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration has been aggressive in shepherding the oil law toward passage. It is one of the president's benchmarks for the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a fact that Mr. Bush, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Gen. William Casey, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and other administration officials are publicly emphasizing with increasing urgency.
 The administration has highlighted the law's revenue sharing plan, under which the central government would distribute oil revenues throughout the nation on a per capita basis. But the benefits of this excellent proposal are radically undercut by the law's many other provisions -- these allow much (if not most) of Iraq's oil revenues to flow out of the country and into the pockets of international oil companies. 
 The law would transform Iraq's oil industry from a nationalized model closed to American oil companies except for limited (although highly lucrative) marketing contracts, into a commercial industry, all-but-privatized, that is fully open to all international oil companies. 
 The Iraq National Oil Company would have exclusive control of just 17 of Iraq's 80 known oil fields, leaving two-thirds of known -- and all of its as yet undiscovered -- fields open to foreign control. 
 The foreign companies would not have to invest their earnings in the Iraqi economy, partner with Iraqi companies, hire Iraqi workers or share new technologies. They could even ride out Iraq's current ''instability'' by signing contracts now, while the Iraqi government is at its weakest, and then wait at least two years before even setting foot in the country. The vast majority of Iraq's oil would then be left underground for at least two years rather than being used for the country's economic development.
 The international oil companies could also be offered some of the most corporate-friendly contracts in the world, including what are called production sharing agreements. These agreements are the oil industry's preferred model, but are roundly rejected by all the top oil producing countries in the Middle East because they grant long-term contracts (20 to 35 years in the case of Iraq's draft law) and greater control, ownership and profits to the companies than other models. In fact, they are used for only approximately 12 percent of the world's oil.
 Iraq's neighbors Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia maintain nationalized oil systems and have outlawed foreign control over oil development. They all hire international oil companies as contractors to provide specific services as needed, for a limited duration, and without giving the foreign company any direct interest in the oil produced. 
 Iraqis may very well choose to use the expertise and experience of international oil companies. They are most likely to do so in a manner that best serves their own needs if they are freed from the tremendous external pressure being exercised by the Bush administration, the oil corporations -- and the presence of 140,000 members of the American military.
 Iraq's five trade union federations, representing hundreds of thousands of workers, released a statement opposing the law and rejecting ''the handing of control over oil to foreign companies, which would undermine the sovereignty of the state and the dignity of the Iraqi people.'' They ask for more time, less pressure and a chance at the democracy they have been promised.

HEADLINE: China's Trade Surplus Near Record Last Month

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hilda Wang contributed reporting.

DATELINE: HONG KONG, March 12 

 BODY:
China's already large export business has accelerated this year, with the customs agency announcing Monday that the February trade surplus nearly tied a record set in October.
 The size of the surplus, $23.76 billion, surprised economists because Chinese exports tend to lag in the winter after surging in late summer and autumn, when deliveries are made to retailers preparing for Christmas.
China's rising trade surplus with the United States has produced growing pressure in Congress in recent weeks, and the latest announcement is likely to feed the debate. Lawmakers have proposed steep duties on Chinese exports unless China takes immediate action to end government subsidies to industries and to allow its currency to rise faster against the dollar. 
 The latest trade statistic ''will no doubt inflame political tensions on China trade,'' said R. Glenn Hubbard, a former chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers who is now dean of the Columbia Business School.
 China's commerce minister, Bo Xilai, warned in Beijing Monday that China particularly opposes one proposal: imposition of a 27.5 percent tax on American imports from China unless the Chinese government allows significant currency appreciation. Mr. Bo described that option as destructive to bilateral trade.
 Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of China's central bank, said at a news conference with Mr. Bo that China would develop a financial system that depends more on markets and would allow greater flexibility in the value of the country's currency, known as the yuan or renminbi, news agencies reported from Beijing.
 Chinese officials have periodically hinted that they might widen the limit on how much the yuan can trade up or down in a single day, currently set at three-tenths of a percent. But officials have given little sign that they are willing to allow faster appreciation of the yuan, which has crept up by 6.7 percent since China broke its peg to the dollar in July 2005.
 During a speech last week in Shanghai, the United States Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., called for China to free its financial system from many government controls. But the Bush administration has opposed setting benchmarks for how fast the yuan should appreciate or threatening specific responses if any benchmarks are not met.
 The February surplus nearly reached the record of $23.83 billion set in October. Taking January and February together -- a common adjustment made to eliminate variability caused by Chinese New Year festivities, which in any given year can be in either month -- the surplus soared to $39.61 billion this year compared with $12.16 billion in those months of 2006.
 Most of the increase has come from a sharp acceleration in exports, while imports have slowed slightly. That suggests the appreciation of the yuan has not yet had a significant effect, said Liang Hong, a Goldman Sachs economist.
 The J. C. & Winsons Company, a Hong Kong maker of gloves, hats, scarves and bags for export to stores in Europe, North America and Australia, is one of many examples of companies exporting from China that seem to have weathered the gradual rise of China's currency.
 ''The appreciation of the renminbi has obviously had an effect on our cost base, since all our products are made in China,'' said Betty Chong, a company director. ''However, up till now, I would not say that this fact has adversely affected our business. Typically, the relationships with our customers are longstanding ones, where reliability and excellent customer service are also key considerations.''
 The Monday data was an initial snapshot of trade patterns in February, and did not break down trade with specific countries. Ms. Liang said that there were hints that China's exports were rising especially quickly to developing countries like India and certain African nations.
 Chinese exports of manufacturing equipment for factories were particularly strong in February, for example. China tends to produce less sophisticated equipment than would typically be installed in highly automated factories in a country with high labor costs like the United States -- although Chinese manufacturers are rapidly improving the quality of their products. 
 Franklin L. Lavin, the under secretary of commerce for international trade, said that the annual growth rate of China's exports to the United States has been gradually slowing over the last several years, partly because China has been exporting more to countries other than the United States. On Monday, Mr. Lavin said in an e-mail message that in January, American exports to China rose 24.9 percent, while imports grew 19.8 percent. But imports from China were still more than four times the American exports. 
 The overall Chinese export surge, however, was broadly based. It included soaring shipments in January and February of goods like steel, up 180 percent, and furniture, up 48 percent, that have long been politically sensitive in industrialized countries.

HEADLINE: Sniffing Out Fraud In the Bottle

BYLINE: By Eric Asimov

 BODY:
A FEW months ago a wealthy wine collector held a dinner to taste some rare old Burgundies that he had purchased at a recent auction. He had invited several fellow Burgundy lovers, and the wines poured that night, ranging from 45 to 85 years old and worth tens of thousands of dollars, represented just a small cross-section of the purchase.
 The collector's primary reason for the dinner was simply to enjoy great wines with like-minded friends. But the dinner had another purpose as well, a purpose that points at the burden of suspicion that these days weighs heavily on the high-stakes wine market.
''It was an authentication tasting,'' said Allen Meadows of burghound.com, a leading Burgundy critic who attended the dinner. ''Off the top of my head we had 17 wines, three of which I personally felt were outright fakes.'' 
 Such a tasting would have been unimaginable 20 years ago, when high-end wine collecting was seen as the quaint province of dusty aristocrats, and even the rarest old bottles might fetch a few hundred dollars at best. But the world of wine collecting and the stakes involved have changed dramatically since then.
 Today, the price of coveted old wines has shot upward, with individual bottles primarily of aged Burgundy and Bordeaux wines selling for thousands of dollars, and sometimes tens of thousands dollars each. Naturally, this small but lucrative market has become a fat target in the last five years for counterfeiters hoping to capitalize on the thirst for rare wines and the difficulties in telling the difference between real and fake. 
 The federal government is now investigating whether auction houses, collectors or importers knowingly sold wines that were not from the vintages listed on the labels. Ordinary wine lovers, even those who buy a few cases of great wines each year, are unlikely to be affected by scammers, unless they buy old wines or buy their wines from secondary sources, like brokers or through Internet auctions. Even so, most of the action takes place with extremely rare, extremely expensive bottles.
 Wine collecting is now a world-wide phenomenon, with collectors from Russia and Asia, along with brand new zillionaires, leaping into the game with seemingly bottomless pools of cash. Sometimes they are easy marks for counterfeiters and act as entry points for circulating bad bottles, a fact not lost on experts looking for red flags. 
 The difficulty in identifying bad bottles easily results in collector profiling.
 ''If a 25-year-old Wall Street exec says to me he's selling wines, and he's made all his money in the last three years and he's got $5 million worth of wines, I feel suspect,'' said Tim Kopec, the wine director of Veritas restaurant in New York, who sometimes acts as a consultant for collectors. ''The problem is when you see older bottles, you're never positive.''
 The rise of Internet sales and wine auctions has given all collectors the opportunity to bid against each other for what ought to be very few bottles. Wine auctions were not even legal in New York until 1993. 
 Now, New York is auction central, with about $131 million worth of wine sold in 2006, up 66 percent from 2005, according to Peter D. Meltzer, a writer who chronicles auctions for Wine Spectator magazine. Worldwide, auction sales of wine topped $240 million last year, up 45 percent from 2005. Last fall, a six-magnum case of 1945 Chateau Mouton Rothschild was auctioned off by Christie's in Los Angeles for $345,000, or $57,500 a magnum. On a smaller scale, a bottle of 1955 La Mission Haut-Brion can be found on the Internet for $4,000 -- $10,000 if you want a magnum. 
 That was a significant number to me. Back in 1990 I splurged on a 35th anniversary gift for my parents, paying $275 for a bottle of that '55 La Mission. Even accounting for inflation and the increased scarcity of an older wine, that's an astounding increase.
 ''Ten years ago nobody was even thinking about counterfeit wines,'' said John Kapon, the president and auction director of Acker Merrall & Condit, a New York wine merchant.
 Back in October, Mr. Kapon presided over an auction in New York that sold almost $24.7 million worth of wine, which demolished the previous record by more than $10 million. But this auction, from the private holdings of Rudy Kurniawan, a wealthy young collector from Los Angeles, came with a guarantee intended to protect against fraud. If buyers weren't satisfied with any part of their purchase within 90 days, Acker Merrall would buy back that part. 
 That 90-day timeframe led to what Mr. Meadows called the authentication dinner, where several experts, including a Burgundy producer and a leading New York sommelier, offered their collective opinions on whether wines purchased at that auction were genuine.
 Yet even with their expertise, bogus wines are not easy to spot. The obvious fakes -- those with labels where, say, Chateau Lafite-Rothschild is misspelled -- may be more legend than anything else. Or they may be real. 
 Mr. Meadows recalled that the 1911 Musigny Vieilles Vignes from Comte Georges de Vogue, one of the world's coveted producers, came with an unfortunate juxtaposition in the word ''vieilles.''
 ''The real thing has the misspelling,'' he said. 
 One bottle served at the dinner, a 1923 Bonnes Mares from Georges Roumier, was suspicious simply because the domaine was not established until 1924.
 ''But it was possible,'' Mr. Meadows said. ''When they took the domaine over, it could have come with stocks of wine.'' 
 Nonetheless, Mr. Meadows felt that wine was a fake because the color seemed far too youthful for a bottle more than 80 years old.
 ''Could you have a wine that does not conform to the average still be real?'' he asked. ''Yeah, it's possible. But is it likely? No.''
 Another wine, he decided, was clearly not what it purported to be. Still, it was a judgment call. ''When you have enough examples of old Burgundy and you get something that doesn't resemble anything you've ever had, you just know that either it's been cut or it's not pinot at all,'' he said.
 One person at the dinner, who also collected old phonograph records and was accustomed to culling fakes, decided to examine the label with a magnifying glass. Sure enough, Mr. Meadows said, he found several tiny details that were wrong, like images of twigs that were turned up rather than down.
 There's no telling what's actually in a bottle of counterfeit wine. It could range from complete plonk, which might easily be written off as corked or otherwise flawed, to something that is quite delicious even if it's not the advertised wine. In a case like that, the scammer might have taken, say, a bottle of a coveted wine like Henri Jayer Cros Parantoux from an ordinary vintage, like 1982, and changed the label to reflect an in-demand vintage, say 1985, increasing the value of the bottle by five or 10 times, or even more. 
 Or, the scammer might slap a label on a bottle of good but unrelated wine. A collector investing in old Burgundy might find himself drinking an old Hermitage -- very good, but not what he paid for.
 As to who is producing the bogus bottles, the answers amount to little more than guesswork. 
 ''It's a small group of select people, not hundreds of counterfeiters all over the place,'' Mr. Kapon speculated. Mr. Meadows suggested that the lack of standards in the wine business makes counterfeiting bottles relatively easy compared with counterfeiting currency, a more demanding task. He suggested that the federal inquiry might discourage counterfeiters.
 ''It's no longer a risk-free game,'' he said.
 Wine producers themselves have made tracking counterfeit wines far more difficult because of their own haphazard business practices, particularly before World War II when few records were kept. Back in those days, few estates bottled all their own wine. Often they would sell barrels of wine to merchants, or to importers, who would bottle the wine themselves, using subtly different labels. Sometimes, but not always, producers might stamp the cork with the name of their domaine and the vintage, so a bottle with a generic cork might indicate a problem, but maybe not. Mr. Kapon recalled that Chateau Mouton-Rothschild in the 1970s and 80s released hundreds of cases of older wines. ''The bottles looked new, but they could still be authentic,'' he said.
 And then you have devious practices of the wine producers themselves. In the 19th century Burgundy producers were known to beef up a bad vintage with a little wine from the Rhone or even from Algeria. Today, some wine producers may take older bottles, which have lost wine to evaporation, and top them off with a more recent vintage of the same wine, effectively freshening up the bottle.
 ''A 1915, topped off with some 1985, is that a sin?'' Mr. Meadows asked. ''Well, it raises the question of why you have a vintage. I'm personally offended by that.''
 A less pernicious form of topping off is called reconditioning. If a producer has a supply of older wines, one bottle may be sacrificed to top off the others. The producer may add a small dose of sulfur dioxide, a stabilizer, and replace the old cork with a new one. Some producers, like Domaine de Romanee-Conti, will stamp the cork ''reconditioned.'' Purists might prefer not to have their bottles reconditioned but nobody considers it unethical.
 The fear of counterfeit bottles may stop somebody from trying to track down a single bottle of Chateau Petrus 1961 on the Internet. But for collectors with deep pockets concern may not outweigh thirst.
 ''If someone wants to defraud you, they can,'' said Tom Black, a collector in Nashville, Tenn. ''But I don't want to miss an opportunity at a great old wine just because you can't read the date on the cork.''

HEADLINE: In a Charge of Plagiarism, An Echo of a Father's Case

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
Jacqueline R. Griffith seemed to be flourishing as a tenured assistant professor in economics and finance at Kean University in New Jersey -- that is, until another member of her department accused her of having plagiarized sizable portions of her doctoral dissertation.
 Deja vu? Flash back to 1982, when her father, Claude Jonnard, a business school professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University, also in New Jersey, was accused of copying government documents in a book under his own name, without citing any of them. 
Mr. Jonnard said at the time that his actions were neither illegal nor unethical because the documents were not copyrighted. Willard Gingerich, Fairleigh Dickinson's current provost, said records showed that the university looked into the accusation but took no action because the professor had not broken the law, and because the person making the accusation had recently been dismissed. 
 Mr. Jonnard, now 71, is still on the faculty and was a department chairman at Fairleigh Dickinson's College at Florham for many years. But Ms. Griffith, who is 38, has had less luck. 
 She resigned late Friday, as both Kean, a public university in Union, and Nova Southeastern University, an independent institution in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which granted her a doctorate in business administration, were investigating the plagiarism accusation. 
 Daniel Higgins, a Kean spokesman, said that the university would not release her resignation letter, but that it was one sentence long and effective immediately. Ms. Griffith's lawyer did not return telephone messages seeking comment yesterday. 
 Asked in a telephone interview whether she had copied her dissertation, Ms. Griffith said, ''I don't believe so,'' adding, ''But let me call you back.'' Fifteen minutes later, her lawyer, Corinne Mullen, called, saying she would look into the matter.
 Ms. Griffith's troubles, somewhat like her father's, began with a disgruntled colleague -- in her case, Bruce M. Skoorka, also an assistant professor of economics and finance. 
 Mr. Skoorka had joined the university in 1996 with a doctorate in economics from New York University. Ms. Griffith joined the full-time economics and finance faculty a year later as an assistant professor and was kept on for years even though she did not have a doctorate then.
 Mr. Skoorka said in an interview that he began criticizing the quality of professors being hired, promoted and given tenure in his department -- including Ms. Griffith -- nine years ago. In 2001, he filed a lawsuit against the university, charging that he was being discriminated against and harassed in part because of his complaints. 
 In the litigation, he included one memo from a senior professor, Carol M. Condon, saying Ms. Griffith should not be retained because she lacked the required qualifications and because of inaccuracies in her file. One important inaccuracy, the memo said, was her claim to be co-author of two books that were written by her father. 
 The memo noted that the title page of the actual publications showed the single author to be Mr. Jonnard. Ms. Griffith was only thanked for her assistance in the acknowledgments. 
 Looking for more, Mr. Skoorka examined Ms. Griffith's doctoral dissertation, approved in 2001, and found another that seemed very similar, written at Louisiana Tech University in 1995. He said in an interview that he was ''determined to do something about this.'' He hired a detective to find the author, whose name, Helen B. Mason, had since changed to Helen Sikes because of remarriage.
 Now a professor at Centenary College of Louisiana, Ms. Sikes said recently that when the detective called her last summer, ''I thought it was a joke, a sick joke.''
 But after examining Ms. Griffith's dissertation, she said, she concluded that ''90 percent of the narrative'' was a copy of her own. She joined Mr. Skoorka in sending letters to Kean and Nova in December, charging plagiarism. The professors asked that Nova revoke Ms. Griffith's doctorate and that Kean dismiss her.
 Mr. Higgins, the Kean spokesman, when asked about the plagiarism complaint, would say only that the provost and the dean of its College of Business and Public Administration had met with a professor whom he would not name, and that the matter was being referred to Kean's Research Integrity Committee. He also said he could not comment on Mr. Skoorka's lawsuit.
 At Nova, Frank DePiano, the academic vice president, said Nova was also reviewing a plagiarism complaint, but would not say anything more specific. 
 Mr. Jonnard, Ms. Griffith's father, said in an interview last week that he was aware of the plagiarism accusation against his daughter, but declined to comment about it. Asked if he still believed that he had done nothing wrong in his book, he said: ''That was my view then. I haven't thought about it recently.''
 Universities differ in their handling of plagiarism. ''Reported cases reveal ad hoc responses at best, and indifference or denial at worst,'' said Timothy M. Dodd, executive director of the Center for Academic Integrity at Duke University, which counts more than 350 colleges and universities, not including Kean or Nova, among its members. 
 At Ohio University, in Athens, where a mini-epidemic of plagiarism among master's and doctoral theses in the engineering school was reported three years ago, the university's Academic Honesty Hearing Committee has dismissed four cases so far, deemed six theses to warrant rewriting, and called for revoking only one diploma, a ruling that is being appealed. But the reviews are still underway.
 Before she resigned at Kean, Ms. Griffith appeared to be trying to set things right. Her lawyer, Ms. Mullen, said she was rewriting some pages of the dissertation. Ms. Griffith called her former faculty adviser at Nova to ask if he would read the new pages. She contacted UMI, which maintains a database of doctoral dissertations, to see if she could substitute a new version of her work for the one filed earlier. 
 Her former faculty adviser, Alan Gart, who left Nova about six years ago and moved to Pennsylvania, confirmed that he had received a call from Ms. Griffith in January or early February, saying, ''I did something bad; I copied,'' and asking him to read some redone pages.
 He said that he barely recalled her -- ''I only remember one thing, that she was in a hurry'' -- but that he agreed to read the pages, even though he no longer had any ties to Nova and no authority.
 ''I tried to be a nice guy,'' he said. 
 Mr. DePiano, Nova's academic vice president, said, ''I don't know of a situation where after the formal dissertation process was completed, revisions were later accepted.''

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New Jersey: Princeton Returns Grant

BYLINE: BLOOMBERG NEWS; Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
Princeton University has given back $782,375 to a foundation that is seeking the return of hundreds of millions more in grants it gave to universities. Princeton is returning the money, which was used for a now-defunct program aimed at supporting graduate students in economics, politics and sociology. The payment is the latest move in a battle to control the Robertson Foundation, which began as a $35 million gift to Princeton in 1961 by heirs to the A.&P. supermarket fortune, and has increased to more than $800 million. The Robertson family said that the gift was to be used to train foreign affairs specialists but that Princeton used some of it for other purposes. Princeton said in a statement it had not used the money improperly, although it did not adequately disclose the program's nature to the foundation board.

HEADLINE: Brazilian Government Invests in Culture of Hip-Hop

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil 

 BODY:
In a classroom at a community center near a slum here, a street-smart teacher offers a dozen young students tips on how to improve their graffiti techniques. One floor below, in a small soundproof studio, another instructor is teaching a youthful group of would-be rappers how to operate digital recording and video equipment.
 This is one of Brazil's Culture Points, fruit of an official government program that is helping to spread hip-hop culture across a vast nation of 185 million people. With small grants of $60,000 or so to scores of community groups on the outskirts of Brazil's cities, the Ministry of Culture hopes to channel what it sees as the latent creativity of the country's poor into new forms of expression.
 The program, conceived in 2003, is an initiative of Brazil's minister of culture, Gilberto Gil, who will be speaking on digital culture and related topics on Wednesday at the South by Southwest Music and Media Conference in Austin, Tex. Though today one of the country's most revered pop stars, Mr. Gil, 64, was often ostracized at the start of his own career and so feels a certain affinity with the hip-hop culture emerging here. 
 ''These phenomena cannot be regarded negatively, because they encompass huge contingents of the population for whom they are the only connection to the larger world,'' he said in a February interview. ''A government that can't perceive this won't have the capacity to formulate policies that are sufficiently inclusive to keep young people from being diverted to criminality or consigned to social isolation.''
 As a result of the Culture Points and similar programs, Mr. Gil said, ''you've now got young people who are becoming designers, who are making it into media and being used more and more by television and samba schools and revitalizing degraded neighborhoods.'' He added, ''It's a different vision of the role of government, a new role.''
 As the ministry sees it, hip-hop culture consists of four elements: M.C.'s (rappers), D.J.'s, break dancers and graffiti artists. At the Projeto Casulo, a community center here on a narrow, winding street at the foot of a favela, or squatter slum, all four art forms are being taught to dozens of young residents.
 ''This program has really democratized culture,'' Guine Silva, a 32-year-old rapper who is the director of the center, said during a tour of its simple concrete building. ''We've become a multimedia laboratory. Getting that seed money and that studio equipment has enabled us to become a kind of hip-hop factory.''
 Though links to music run strong and deep in Brazilian culture, the notion of using taxpayers' money to encourage rap and graffiti art is not universally accepted. But because Mr. Gil's musical judgment is widely respected, the level of skepticism and resistance is lower than might be expected.
 ''Gil still has to fight against other parts of the government in favor of things that everyone else there thinks are alienating junk, but he's willing to do that, whether it's on behalf of rap or funk or brega,'' another style of music considered vulgar and lower class, said Hermano Vianna, a writer and anthropologist who works in digital culture programs. ''He looks at that sort of thing not with prejudice, but rather as a business opportunity.''
 On the other hand, some important exponents of hip-hop culture in Brazil, like the rapper Manu Brown and the writer Ferrez, remain skeptical and have chosen to keep their distance from the government program. Others are participating but complain of the bureaucracy involved.
 ''The idea is great because it has brought about a level of recognition we didn't have before,'' said the rapper Aliado G., president of an entity called Hip Hop Nation Brazil. ''But people get frustrated when a project of theirs is approved, and they can't get the money because they don't know how to do all the paperwork.''
 Brazilian rap, at least as it has developed in poor neighborhoods here in the country's largest city, tends to be highly politicized and scornful of lyrics that boast about wealth or sexual conquests. In contrast, the funk movement in Brazil, also imported from the United States but centered in Rio de Janeiro, is unabashedly about celebrating sex, bling and violence.
 ''When U.S. rap groups come here and try to be ostentatious or do the gangster thing, they get booed off the stage,'' Mr. Silva said. ''We feel a kinship with Chuck D and Public Enemy'' -- known for their political commentary -- ''but we don't have any respect for people like Snoop Dogg and Puff Daddy.''
 Since established commercial radio stations and publishing houses have shown minimal interest in the music and poetry that new hip-hop artists are producing, or want to impose contract terms that are too stringent, rappers have developed their own channels to distribute their work. These range from selling their discs and books themselves on the streets and at shows to having the works played on a network of low-power but linked community radio stations.
 ''There is an entire industry being built in the informal sector,'' Mr. Vianna said. ''If you were to apply all the laws in place today, no producer can release a record from a favela. So you have to create a new model, and Gil is willing to do that.''
 At the Projeto Casulo, the Culture Points program has produced a pair of documentaries about housing problems, complete with a rap accompaniment, that were broadcast on commercial television. The center has also generated a radionovela, a fanzine and a community newspaper and plans next to set up an online radio station to broadcast the rap songs that its musicians and those at similar community centers here have composed and recorded.
 In addition, a Culture Ministry grant enabled Hip Hop Nation Brazil to publish a book called ''Hip Hop in Pencil,'' a collection of rap lyrics. After a first edition of 2,000 copies quickly sold out in 2005 and was nominated for a literary prize, a conventional publishing house was interested enough to negotiate a deal to publish subsequent editions.
 ''We had never before seen our story told in a book, and at first the publishing houses didn't take us seriously,'' said Toni C, one of the editors and authors of the collection. ''Books had always been used as a weapon against us, and people didn't know that such a thing as hip-hop literature existed. Now they do.''
 Brazilian law also offers tax breaks to companies that contribute to cultural endeavors like films, ballet and art exhibitions. Rap music has now been granted similar standing, and as a result, some of the country's largest corporations have begun underwriting hip-hop records and shows.
 At a recent event in Campinas, a city of one million an hour's drive from here, the sponsors included a power company, a bank, a construction business and an industrial conglomerate. As a troupe of break dancers strutted their most flashy moves, D.J.'s and M.C.'s railed against social, economic and racial inequality with lyrics like ''Reality is always hard/for those who have dark skin/if you don't watch out/you'll end up in the paddy wagon.''
 ''It took a while for companies to wake up to the potential this offers,'' said Augusto Rodrigues, an executive of the power company and the director of the cultural center where the show was held. ''But there's a hunger for cultural programs like this, in which for the first time in 20 years, the ideology of the periphery can express itself.''

HEADLINE: Bad Loans Put Wall St. In a Swoon

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Stocks fell broadly and sharply yesterday afternoon after a report on mortgage defaults indicated that the troubled housing market will weaken further before showing signs of improvement. 
 Though default and foreclosure rates have only recently begun rising from historic lows, the report from the Mortgage Bankers Association unnerved investors because it showed that a record number of homes entered the foreclosure process in the fourth quarter. It also indicated that problems that had previously been limited to economically weak areas were cropping up in more vibrant places like California.
With shares of financial companies leading the way, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 242.66 points, or 1.97 percent, to 12,075.96, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 28.65 points, or 2.04 percent, to 1,377.95. The fallout continued in Asia, with shares declining 1 percent to 3 percent in the major markets in mid-day trading today.
 The slide echoed a sell-off two weeks ago driven in part by concerns about mortgages made to borrowers with weak, or subprime, credit and by a 9 percent drop in the Shanghai market. The S.& P. and Dow indexes are now down more than 5 percent since Feb. 20. [Page C11.] 
 Yesterday's report by the mortgage bankers found that about 0.54 percent of all home loans entered foreclosure in the fourth quarter, the highest ever in the 37-year history of the survey. The problems were most heavily concentrated among subprime mortgages, but the default rates also increased on loans made to prime borrowers and on loans that are part of government programs.
 ''It's a measurable weakening in credit quality across the board,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. 
 The rise in delinquencies will further strain the housing market, he said, because more houses will be put up for sale as foreclosures end in auctions, driving down home prices, which in turn will make it harder for struggling homeowners to refinance or sell their properties.
 ''This has a long way to play out,'' he said, ''because it now has this self-reinforcing quality that is seemingly kicking in and will extend the housing correction.''
 Delinquency and foreclosure rates were highest in states like Ohio and Indiana, which are suffering from the loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs, and Louisiana and Mississippi on the Gulf Coast, where a slow pace of reconstruction has worsened the pain from hurricane damage.
 But defaults were growing, albeit from a low base, even in relatively prosperous California, the nation's most populous state and home to some of its most heated housing markets until recently. About 2.03 percent of subprime mortgages in California entered foreclosure, which is more than the 1.83 percent of loans that were already in foreclosure there during the third quarter. Homes typically stay in foreclosure for several months.
 Around the country, big states like Massachusetts, Colorado, Georgia and Texas also had high and rising foreclosure rates. The state statistics are not seasonally adjusted, unlike the national data.
 The center of the country is exhibiting an ''early warning sign of an infection that will quickly enough get to the coasts,'' said Edward Leamer, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles. Both Mr. Leamer and Mr. Zandi noted that they did not expect the mortgage problems to presage a recession as long as the job market remained healthy.
 Still, the mounting troubles of subprime lenders have been raising fears of a broader financial fallout. New Century Financial, one of the biggest subprime lenders, said yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission and a federal grand jury were seeking documents in investigations into trading in its shares and accounting errors. New Century stopped making loans last week after Wall Street banks closed off its financing.
 Another subprime company, Accredited Home Lenders, said that it was facing a cash squeeze because of margin calls from its banks and was considering "strategic alternatives.'' Shares in the company fell 65.2 percent, to $3.97.
 Residential Capital, the mortgage division of GMAC, reported an operating loss of $651 million for the fourth quarter, in contrast to a profit of $118 million a year ago, because of rising losses and reserves for future losses in its subprime business. General Motors will inject $1 billion into GMAC as a result.
 According to the mortgage bankers' survey, 6.14 percent of all home loans were past due or in foreclosure in the fourth quarter, up from 5.72 percent. The portion of subprime loans, which are given largely to poor and minority borrowers, past due or in foreclosure rose to 17.86 percent, from 16.42 percent. 
 The default rates are at their highest since 2002 and early 2003, when the economy was a lot weaker than it is today and unemployment was hovering close to 6 percent. By comparison, at the end of last year the unemployment rate was 4.5 percent.
 Senator Christopher Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said the government might have to step in to provide aid to struggling homeowners. ''The impact of losing 2.2 million homes I suspect will be in a lot of areas of our cities and towns that are already pretty hard hit,'' Mr. Dodd told reporters after a speech at the National League of Cities, according to Bloomberg News.
 Douglas G. Duncan, the chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said default rates were rising and would probably peak at the end of 2007 because about half the mortgages today were issued less than three years ago and borrowers are most vulnerable during the third and fourth years of their loans.
 Other industry experts add that the current rise in defaults is also a function of looser lending practices in the last two or three years. Many lenders made loans without requiring down payments or verifying borrowers' incomes with tax statements or pay stubs. Some borrowers -- though it is hard to say precisely how many -- may have also experienced payment shock from the resetting of adjustable-rate mortgages.
 Furthermore, the slowing housing market has made it harder for borrowers to sell their properties or refinance, because their homes may be worth less than the outstanding balance on their loans.
 Dozens of small companies that specialized in subprime lending have gone out of business or stopped making loans. Other companies like Countrywide Financial, the nation's largest mortgage lender, are tightening standards.
 In an appearance on CNBC, Angelo Mozilo, the chief executive of Countrywide, said investors were overreacting to the subprime problems. ''This is now becoming a liquidity crisis, an unnecessary one,'' he said. ''There's been a rush to judgment.''
 A top executive at Goldman Sachs, which was among the investment banks that financed subprime lenders, said credit problems appeared to be safely confined to the subprime category. 
 ''I can't predict the future, but as we sit here today, we really have not seen any contagion to the credit markets,'' David A. Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, said during a conference call with analysts and journalists about the firm's record quarterly profits.
 But investors pushed Goldman shares down 1.8 percent, to $199.03.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Barely Rise; Cold Weather Gets Blame

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Retail sales rose less than forecast in February as cold weather kept shoppers home.
 The gain was 0.1 percent, largely because of gasoline and car purchases, the Commerce Department said yesterday in Washington. The previous month had shown no gain. 
 Sales excluding automobiles unexpectedly dropped 0.1 percent, after a revised 0.2 percent gain that was smaller than previously reported.
 The figures point to a gradual slowdown in consumer spending, a crucial part of the economy and one that Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has said is a mainstay of the expansion. Economists at Credit Suisse and Macroeconomic Advisers were among those who lowered their forecasts for first-quarter economic growth.
 ''This is mostly weather-related,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight in Lexington, Mass., the only economist in a Bloomberg News survey to predict the drop in purchases aside from cars. ''The underlying dynamics are still decent when it comes to consumer spending. It's weaker than last year, but not a lot.''
 In a further sign of a slowdown, business inventories rose 0.2 percent in January as sales declined by the most in four months, the Commerce Department reported separately. Rising inventories may limit orders to factories in coming months, which will slow production lines, economists said.
 Economists had forecast that retail sales would rise 0.3 percent, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Retail sales account for almost half of all consumer spending, which in turn makes up two-thirds of the economy.
 Sales at clothing stores last month dropped by the most since September 2005, yesterday's report showed. General merchandise store sales declined 0.6 percent, the most since June 2004.
 Purchases at restaurants and bars, furniture, electronics and building material stores also declined last month.
 Automobile dealers showed a 0.9 percent gain in sales, and higher gasoline prices last month contributed to increased sales at service stations.
 Consumer spending may grow at an annual rate of 3.2 percent this quarter, after a 4.2 percent pace in the previous three months, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg from March 1 to March 7. 
 David Greenlaw, chief fixed-income economist at Morgan Stanley, lowered his spending forecast to 3.2 percent, from 3.7 percent, after the report.
 Spending growth has averaged 3.3 percent annually since 1990.

HEADLINE: Houston, the Oil Town, Is Sharing in a Boom

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
The good times are back.
 Galvanized by the record profits at energy companies, this city, the center of the country's energy industry, has shaken off the effects of the Enron implosion six years ago and is enjoying its strongest resurgence in more than 20 years, business officials and real estate developers say.
Some energy companies are expanding and putting up new buildings. Others, like Citgo, Schlumberger and Halliburton, have moved their headquarters to Houston. Oil and natural gas companies have helped reduce office vacancy rates to 15 percent, a five-year low, according to Grubb & Ellis, a real estate company. Job growth is double the national average -- 97,400 jobs were created in 2006. The National Association of Realtors says the housing market in Houston is one of the strongest in the country. 
 ''The increase in the oil business has made Houston,'' said Randall Davis, a Houston condominium developer. ''It feels a touch like the 1980s -- everyone is out, the restaurants are full, the bars are full. It's like New York.'' 
 The good news extends across the city. The port recently opened a $1.4 billion container terminal to tackle soaring traffic. In 2006, it handled 1.6 million 20-foot containers, up 29 percent from 2003. At the Texas Medical Center, hospitals and universities are investing billions in new facilities. Residential and mixed-use developments are going up downtown. 
 The Houston economy has been growing since 2004, when energy companies started investing more in big-ticket projects and hiring thousands of employees to run them. Before that, oil companies had been hesitant to pour more into exploration and production, because they had lost millions in the past when oil and natural gas prices collapsed.
 ''There was always a real reluctance to buy into the commodity cycle,'' said Robert W. Gilmer, vice president and senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
 Those fears are long gone. Real estate investors, enticed by rising rents and occupancy rates, are returning. Over the last five years, sale prices for office buildings in Houston have climbed by 34 percent, to an average of $129 a square foot in 2006, according to Real Capital Analytics, a national research and consulting firm. Compared with other large cities nationwide, like Chicago and San Francisco, where prices average $191 and $338 a square foot, respectively, Houston is still a relative bargain.
 ''The office investment market has taken off,'' said Ariel Guerrero, Texas research and client services manager at Grubb & Ellis in Houston. ''If you look at the price per pound, there's still value.'' 
 Brookfield Properties, a New York-based real estate investment trust, seems to think so. Last October, Brookfield became the biggest landowner in downtown Houston when it joined with the Blackstone Group to buy Trizec Properties for $8.9 billion in cash and debt. The deal gave Brookfield eight buildings in Houston, for a total of 7.4 million square feet. 
 Although the merger included properties nationwide, Richard B. Clark, the chief executive of Brookfield, said Houston was one of the deal's attractions. (Almost a quarter of Brookfield's portfolio is energy-related.)
 Chevron signed a lease shortly afterward for one of the buildings -- the 1.2-million-square-foot tower that used to be Enron's headquarters -- and plans to move in this year. The lease, Brookfield says, was the biggest in the country since 2000 and lowered the availability rate for Class A space downtown. In the fourth quarter, the rate dropped six percentage points, to 12 percent, according to Grubb & Ellis.
 ''This confirms our belief it's a strong market,'' Mr. Clark said. ''I think our timing is good, fundamentals are improving and tenants have confirmed that they're growing.''
 Brookfield is banking that Houston will grow even more. It is considering putting up a new office tower downtown, Mr. Clark said, but is holding off until the availability rate for Class A office space drops below 10 percent. He said he expected it to reach that point within a year.
 Encouraged, developers have started building again. In the fourth quarter, 2.4 million square feet of office space was under construction, more than double the amount in the third quarter. For the first time in years, developers are building without a signed tenant, though most projects are typically smaller than 500,000 square feet.
 Nowhere is the growth more apparent than in the city's Energy Corridor. Straddling Interstate 10 west of downtown, the area -- home to companies like BP, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Citgo -- has become one of the strongest real estate markets in the city. Occupancy rates are at 92 percent, the highest in the city, and rents average $19.26 a square foot, according to Grubb & Ellis.
 ''When occupancy rates reached the mid-90-percent range and there were no blocks of space, we said, 'Hey, maybe it's time to build,' '' said Aaron Thielhorn, a principal at Trammell Crow in Houston.
 Last October, Trammell Crow broke ground on a 330,000-square-foot building in the Energy Corridor without a signed tenant. Construction is to begin this summer on a second building. The two-building project is now the largest under construction in the Energy Corridor.
 Speculative office buildings are also going up in places like the Galleria and downtown, which have less available space. Work on Houston Pavilions, a $170 million complex with retail space, restaurants and music clubs as well as a 13-story office tower, began downtown in February. The Texas Real Estate Fund and the Entertainment Development Group, the builders of the project, have not yet signed an office tenant.
 ''If you would have told me six years ago I'd be investing $170 million downtown, I'd have said you were nuts,'' said William Denton, chief executive and president of the Entertainment Development Group of Agoura Hills, Calif. In those days, he said, downtown Houston often seemed virtually empty.
 Of course, it is an open question whether the good times are here to stay and for how long. Only six years ago, Enron collapsed, the Arthur Anderson accounting firm imploded and Houston was hit hard when the national economy staggered after the Sept. 11 terrorist strikes.
 [Halliburton announced Sunday that it would move its chairman and chief executive, David J. Lesar, from Houston to Dubai and open a corporate headquarters there. Analysts say, however, that the Halliburton move will not lead to a general exodus, because Houston is still the country's energy capital.] 
 Oil and natural gas prices could plummet, some worry, and stall Houston's economy. About half of the city's jobs, or 1.1 million positions, are tied to the energy industry. 
 ''One thing we've learned, whether it's real estate or the oil industry, is that we're always looking over our shoulder,'' said James Arket, senior vice president at Grubb & Ellis in Houston. ''No one takes anything for granted.''
 The Greater Houston Partnership, an organization of businesses, is not waiting for the economy to slow. In 2006, it started a $40 million effort to diversify the local economy and bring 600,000 new jobs to the area over the next decade. Typically, the city creates 45,000 new jobs a year.
 ''It's one of those gulp-and-hold-your-breath figures,'' said Jeff Moseley, president and chief executive of the partnership. ''The economy is very robust, but we're going forward because we know the economy will cool off.''

HEADLINE: Start-Up Fervor Shifts to Energy In Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 13 

 BODY:
Silicon Valley's dot-com era may be giving way to the watt-com era.
 Out of the ashes of the Internet bust, many technology veterans have regrouped and found a new mission in alternative energy: developing wind power, solar panels, ethanol plants and hydrogen-powered cars.
It is no secret that venture capitalists have begun pouring billions into energy-related start-ups with names like SunPower, Nanosolar and Lilliputian Systems.
 But that interest is now spilling over to many others in Silicon Valley -- lawyers, accountants, recruiters and publicists, all developing energy-oriented practices to cater to the cause. 
 The best and the brightest from leading business schools are pelting energy start-ups with resumes. And, of course, there are entrepreneurs from all backgrounds -- but especially former dot-commers -- who express a sense of wonder and purpose at the thought of transforming the $1 trillion domestic energy market while saving the planet.
 ''It's like 1996,'' said Andrew Beebe, one of the remade Internet entrepreneurs. In the boom, he ran Bigstep.com, which helped small businesses sell online. Today, he is president of Energy Innovations, which makes low-cost solar panels. ''The Valley has found a new hot spot.'' 
 Mr. Beebe said the Valley's potential to generate change was vast. But he cautioned that a frenzy was mounting, the kind that could lead to overinvestment and poorly thought-out plans. 
 ''We've started to see some of the bad side of the bubble activity starting to brew,'' Mr. Beebe said. 
 The energy boomlet is part of a broader rebound that is benefiting all kinds of start-ups, including plenty that are focused on the Web. But for many in Silicon Valley, high tech has given way to ''clean tech,'' the shorthand term for innovations that are energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. Less fashionable is ''green,'' a word that suggests a greater interest in the environment than in profit. 
 The similarities to past booms are obvious, but the Valley has always run in cycles. It is a kind of renewable gold rush, a wealth- and technology-creating principle that is always looking for something around which to organize.
 In this case, the energy sector is not so distant from other Silicon Valley specialties as it might appear, say those involved in the new wave of start-ups. The same silicon used to make computer chips converts sunlight into electricity on solar panels, while the bioscience used to make new drugs can be employed to develop better ethanol processing.
 More broadly, the participants here say their whole approach to building new companies and industries is easily transferable to the energy world. But some wonder whether this is just an echo of the excessive optimism of the Internet boom. And even those most involved in the trend say the size of the market opportunity in energy is matched by immense hurdles. 
 Starting a clean technology firm is ''not like starting an online do-it-yourself legal company,'' said Dan Whaley, chief executive of Climos, a San Francisco company that is developing organic processes to remove carbon from the atmosphere. ''Scientific credibility is the primary currency that drives the thing I'm working on.'' 
 Just what that thing is, he would not specify. For competitive reasons, Mr. Whaley declined to get into details about his company's technology. His advisory board includes prominent scientists, among them his mother, Margaret Leinen, the head of geosciences for the National Science Foundation. 
 In the last Silicon Valley cycle, Mr. Whaley's help came from his father. In 1994, he did some of the early work from his father's living room on GetThere.com, a travel site. It went public in 1999 and was bought by Sabre for $750 million in 2000. 
 This time around, entrepreneurs say they are not expecting such quick returns. In the Internet boom, the mantra was to change the world and get rich quick. This time, given the size and scope of the energy market, the idea is to change the world and get even richer -- but somewhat more slowly. 
 Those drawn to the alternative-energy industry say that they need time to understand the energy technology, and to turn ideas into solid companies. After all, in contrast to the Internet boom, this time the companies will need actual manufactured products and customers.
 ''There are real business models and real products to be sold -- established markets and growing economics,'' said George Basile, who has a doctorate in biophysics from the University of California, Berkeley and specializes in energy issues. 
 Mr. Basile has just stepped into the fray himself. In January, he became the executive adviser for energy issues at Bite Communications, a San Francisco public relations firm with scores of technology clients that is now working to attract energy start-ups. 
 The sudden interest of lawyers, accountants and other members of the wider Valley ecosystem strikes some as opportunistic. 
 ''There's a large amount of bandwagon-jumping right now,'' said Mark Hampton, chief executive of Blanc & Otus, a technology-oriented public relations firm whose clients have included TiVo, Sybase and Compaq. Still, he understands the interest of relative newcomers: ''There's a huge opportunity.''
 They are all, plainly, following the money. In the first three quarters of 2006, venture capital firms put $474 million into a broad range of Silicon Valley start-ups in energy storage, generation and efficiency, according to Cleantech Venture Network, an industry trade group. Energy was by far the fastest-growing area of interest, and the amount was on par with what was put into telecommunications and biotechnology.
 Yet the amount of money involved is still relatively small compared with the boom years. Over all, venture funding last year was still less than a third of the nearly $34 billion venture capitalists invested in the region in 2000, the peak of the bubble, according to the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy, based in Palo Alto. 
 ''This is not 2000. It doesn't feel like 2000 on the street,'' said Stephen Levy, the center's director. But, he said, ''there's no doubt there's a buzz.''
 Mr. Levy said that Silicon Valley was getting a lift from the public's interest in finding energy sources and from government involvement in creating subsidies and policies that promote such sources. Still, he said, the ventures are clearly risky.
 ''We'll have a sense very quickly -- within two to four years -- whether any of this venture capital has produced any products or services that are market-worthy,'' Mr. Levy said.
 Apart from the profit motive, many here say they are driven by more unselfish concerns: cleaning up the atmosphere and creating energy independence for the United States. One of the phrases heard most often in the industry is: ''Do well by doing good.'' Al Gore, with his warnings of global warming, has been a Valley darling of late. 
 ''The resumes I'm getting now are almost identical to the ones I got seven years ago for CarsDirect.com,'' said Larry Gross, chief executive of Altra , a company he founded in Los Angeles that is producing ethanol and developing fuels made from plants. ''The quality, the schools, the work experience, the enthusiasm for wanting to fix something.''
 Mr. Gross in 1991 helped found Knowledge Adventure, which made educational software, making him one of the many tech alumni in the energy world. For that company, he said he attracted around $20 million in venture capital; he has received $245 million for Altra. Mr. Gross said investors and entrepreneurs are drawn to energy by what drew them to hardware and software: the chance for huge growth in volatile markets.
 Mr. Gross is the brother of Bill Gross, a technology-era icon whose business incubator Idealab spawned many successful start-ups, including Citysearch and WeddingChannel. Bill Gross is now chief executive of Energy Innovations, the solar panel start-up based in Pasadena, Calif., with Mr. Beebe as president.
 Mr. Beebe said there were profound similarities between the Internet boom and the miniboom in energy. For one, he said, just as the Internet promised to decentralize computing and put control in the hands of users, the Silicon Valley version of energy innovation intends to decentralize the industry by making power generation more local -- like solar panels on rooftops.
 In 1998, Mr. Beebe was a co-founder of Bigstep and raised $75 million in venture funding. At its peak, the company had 150 employees, with most of them laid off during the bust. The company was later sold for less money than it raised -- hardly a dot-com success. So does Mr. Beebe have the track record to make a solar energy company profitable?
 ''I face that question on a regular basis,'' he said. ''Only my actions will be able to answer it.'' But he added that he felt confident about the political and market conditions for energy start-ups. He said the entrenched oil, coal and gas companies could not ultimately compete with the more efficient and environmentally friendly concepts Silicon Valley envisions.
 ''The idea of them turning a supertanker is an apt analogy,'' he said. ''They cannot take us over, they can only try to resist.''

HEADLINE: Renewing a Call to Act Against Climate Change

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: MIDDLEBURY, Vt. 

 BODY:
Some are born earnest, some achieve earnestness, and some have earnestness thrust upon them. Bill McKibben qualifies for inclusion in at least two of these wedges of humanity. 
 In 1989, at the age of 28, he achieved earnestness of a dour, frowning sort as one of the first laymen to warn of global warming in his book ''The End of Nature.'' In the ensuing 18 years, he said recently while cross-country skiing in the woods near his home, he felt caught in a bad dream, forever warning heedless people of a monster in their midst.
 Now, when Mr. McKibben is 46, his role as the philosopher-impresario of the program of climate-change rallies called Step It Up, has thrust new earnestness upon him. This time with a smile.
 Mr. McKibben's title -- scholar in residence at Middlebury College -- seems far too passive to encompass his current frenetic pace. His online call for locally inspired, locally run demonstrations on April 14 has generated plans for a wave of small protests under the Step It Up banner -- 870 and counting, in 49 states (not South Dakota) -- to walk, jog, march, ski, swim, talk, sing, pray and party around the idea of cutting national emissions of heat-trapping gases 80 percent by 2050. 
 Skiers in Wyoming plan to descend a shrinking glacier. New Yorkers plan to form an unbroken human line (dress code: blue shirts) along what might be the new southern shoreline of Manhattan. A group of Dominican sisters and a Wisconsin environmental group are organizing a conference on Sisinawa Mound overlooking the Mississippi River. 
 ''It's a source of eternal pleasure for me to turn on my computer every morning and see what people have come up with the night before,'' Mr. McKibben said. ''Like: We're going to scuba dive with a banner off the endangered coral reefs.'' Or ''I'm going to take my bar mitzvah and make it into a Step It Up rally.''
 But Mr. McKibben also noted in a column on the environmental Web site Grist.org that popular momentum had lagged. ''We don't have a movement,'' he wrote. ''The largest rally yet held in the U.S. about global warming drew a thousand people. If we're going to make the kind of change we need in the short time left us, we need something that looks like the civil rights movement, and we need it now. Changing light bulbs just isn't enough.''
 The rallies, organized online by a half-dozen Middlebury graduates (well, one is still finishing his thesis) hunched over laptops in an otherwise bare conference room in Burlington, could filter a kind of passion and fashion reminiscent of the 1960s through a YouTube lens. 
 All the scattered ''actions,'' as Mr. McKibben and Company are calling them, are to be photographed, with the results put up on the Web on the evening of April 14.
 If one takes the social and political movements of the 20th century as a template, of course, the climate-change movement has been doing things completely out of order. Instead of the old sequence (call to arms, demonstrations, politicians take note, legislation is passed, businesses and communities come around, society internalizes the need for change), the big demonstrations are coming late in the game, long after the call to arms.
 There will be other demonstrations. On Tuesday, environmental groups are busing people to Washington to buttonhole legislators on keeping oil and gas drilling out of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and on cutting emissions. On Friday, the Interfaith Walk for Climate Rescue will leave Northampton, Mass. Then, on April 9, Laurie David, a producer of the Academy Award-winning documentary ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' and the singer Sheryl Crow will begin a 12-city college tour. 
 Why is all this happening now?
 ''I think it's been too big for people to get their heads around,'' Mr. McKibben said. ''Those who wanted to do something did things at home -- your car, your light bulb. Washington was blocked off for work for a long time. People worked really hard at local levels.''
 He takes it as a given that the Bush administration's strategy, working with Asian nations, particularly China, on a voluntary basis on alternative cleaner energy alternatives and setting goals for reducing the amount of heat-trapping gases emitted per unit of gross domestic product is not going to work.
 Instead, Mr. McKibben said, ''only with national and then international commitments are we going to get the scale of things we need done in the small window of time the scientists say we're given.''
 Van Jones, director the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights in Oakland, Calif., is one of relatively few black community organizers to find common cause with those calling for drastic cuts in emissions from the country's tailpipes and smokestacks. Such changes could make poor peoples' electrical bills go up. But Mr. Jones says climate change will hit the poor first and harder than any increase in their electricity.
 ''Two thousand seven is the year that global warming will become a marching issue; 2008 is the year it will become a voting issue,'' Mr. Jones said. ''McKibben is one of the main drivers in moving this thing from the cafes and blogs into the streets.'' 
 Mr. McKibben's proselytizing over the past two decades has not given him the kind of profile enjoyed by Al Gore, the movement's American Idol. As a journalist and the son of one (his father worked for The Boston Globe), Mr. McKibben is more comfortable as a watcher than a climate preacher and more at home putting on his boots in his mud room than standing behind a lectern.
 Mr. McKibben drives a mud-splattered 2003 Honda Civic hybrid to and from the home he and his wife, the writer Sue Halpern, built in Ripton on land once owned by the poet Robert Frost. They moved there and helped design the house -- which won an award from a state conservation group for energy efficiency -- because they wanted to send their only child, Sophie, 13, to a better school than the one she was headed for in upstate New York and because of a position at Middlebury College. 
 Mr. McKibben's 10 books and frequent articles in places like The New York Review of Books have earned him the admiration of Steven Hayward, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group. ''I don't think he's played as large a role as he deserves to have played,'' Mr. Hayward said. ''Serious and thoughtful people take him seriously.''
 Well, maybe not entirely. To his Middlebury acolytes, he is Billy the Kibbs. They admire his knowledge and passion but not his computer skills. They got to know him in the college's dining halls. It was there last fall that Jon Warnow, 22, suggested the name Step It Up for the Internet-connected rallies. It was there that Will Bates, 23, started figuring out how to be the quartermaster for last summer's five-day march across Vermont, which begat the idea of a series of nationwide actions.
 ''It's fair to say we jumped into this without completely understanding where it would end up,'' Mr. McKibben added, looking around the little conference room. 
 Later, on a ski trail near his home, he mused about the sense of dread and impotence that is no longer grafted onto his psyche. ''It's so different,'' he said. In the last year, he said, ''everything just changed.''
 In a little more than three weeks, he hopes to have 870 pictures to prove it.

HEADLINE: Asia and Europe Stocks Follow Wall Street

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS and JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, March 15 

 BODY:
Asian and European stock markets tumbled today, following the sharp drop in U.S. stocks on Tuesday, as concerns spread about the consequences of loose lending practices in the United States housing market. 
 Most markets in Asia closed down between 2 and 3 percent. It was their biggest drop since the sharp declines two weeks ago that were triggered by the sell-off in China on February 27.
Investors sold Asian and European equities after U.S. stocks fell significantly on Tuesday due to concerns about home loans made to borrowers with bad credit histories. An American mortgage association said Tuesday that a record number of homes entered the foreclosure process at the end of last year. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day Tuesday down 1.97 percent, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.04 percent. Shares of financial companies led the way. 
 Today in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed down 2.57 percent at 18,836.93. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 was down 2.92 percent at 16,676.89, and Standard & Poor's Australia index dropped 2.1 percent to close at 5,741.90. 
 After Asia's sharp falls, European stocks opened weak. By early afternoon trading today, Britain's FTSE 100 index was down by 1.5 percent, at 6,070. Germany's DAX Index was down 108, or 1.6 percent, to 6,514, and the CAC 40 Index in France dropped 78 points, or 1.4 percent, to 5,355.
 Francis Lun, general manager of Fulbright Securities in Hong Kong, said that the crisis in the U.S. housing market was having a ''destructive effect on global financial markets around the world.''
 After several months of smooth climbing, Asian equity investors have been treated to a bumpy ride in recent weeks. They could face even more volatility in the future, analysts say.
 Asian markets have been flooded with liquidity in the past 24 months, thanks to a combination of domestic investors, hedge funds, and proprietary trading desks at banks. Many of these investors trade on the movement of market indices, exacerbating stock drops and heightening their jumps. 
 The shares of banks and lending institutions in Asia were hard hit today, as were companies that make consumer goods. The number of United States consumers who are late paying off their home loans is climbing steadily, particularly among borrowers with a history of credit problems, known as subprime borrowers.
 Asian investors and economists predict that these consumers will stop buying new cars, electronics and other goods, hurting Asian economies. 
 Japan's Chiba Bank closed down 4.31 percent to 1,022 yen today, and Sony Corp dropped 4.09 percent to 5,869 yen. 
 HSBC Holdings, the British bank, dropped 1.5 percent in Hong Kong to $135HK.
 HSBC has been hurt by United States housing market problems after it bought Household International in 2003, a United States lender that specializes in loans to borrowers with bad credit. On Feb. 7, HSBC shocked investors when it said it was setting aside $1.76 billion to cover potential mortgage losses in America, 20 percent more than analysts estimated.The drumbeat of bad consumer news from the United States, where more than 1 in 10 subprime home borrowers are late paying back their loans, is having an effect on investors' appetite for risky stocks, analysts say. 
 ''Investors are becoming a bit more risk adverse,'' said Yiping Huang, economic and market analysis with Citigroup Global Markets Asia. 
 In Europe today, investors' worries about continuing negative news concerning the American economy, including possible slower earnings growth, were behind the stock market declines, analysts said.
 ''Even though European earnings have been much more robust and Europe has not suffered the same problems in banking and consumer behavior as the U.S., if the U.S. is going in a slowdown direction then that is the main driver,'' Andrew Lapthorne, a research analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort in London, said.
 Mortgage lenders in Europe, where the sub-prime lending market is far less developed, have not suffered as much as their American counterparts. 
 Annik Lambert, secretary general of the European Mortgage Federation, said that sub-prime lending is not as much of a problem in Europe because consumer protection legislation prevents financial institutions from granting loans with interest rates above a certain level.
 Nevertheless, investors in Europe are concerned about earnings growth at banks. 
 In Britain, higher interest rates and rising costs for gas and electricity have pushed personal insolvencies to record levels.
 Lloyds TSB Group, the biggest provider of consumer loans in Britain, said last month that its consumer and mortgage lending was decelerating.
 Meanwhile, the Bank of England's three interest-rate increases since August have so far failed to cool the property market, meaning that consumers are still willing to take on debt, although at a slower rate. despite the interest rates rises.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg, in Washington, Warns of Economic Inequality

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13 

 BODY:
Flanked by national leaders in government and business, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg warned on Tuesday that widening financial inequality in the United States was ''not morally right'' and expressed concern about the surging economic growth of China. 
 With the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., sitting to his right, and Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, to his left, the mayor seemed to be in his element on Tuesday morning, referring several times to the financial information company he founded, Bloomberg L.P. 
Mayor Bloomberg was the only current elected official among the 11 speakers invited to take part in a Treasury Department conference at Georgetown University on the competitiveness of United States capital markets, a fact that invited some light-hearted speculation among the participants about his political aspirations.
 The mayor elaborated on a concern he has expressed repeatedly: that the United States and New York City are losing ground to other countries and cities.
 ''We have a competitiveness problem in this country, not just in finance, but in medicine and in science and in education and even in the art world,'' the mayor said. ''The rest of the world is catching up, and, there are people that say, surpassing us. I hope they are wrong. I hope those who think we are still in good shape are right. But nevertheless, the time to address these issues is right now.''
 Mayor Bloomberg said that financial competitiveness is ''not just a New York City problem,'' but ''something everybody should be worried about.''
 The mayor also staunchly defended open immigration and free trade. ''The things that we have to worry about is this protectionist movement that has reared its head again in this country and the anti-immigration movement, which will destroy our children's future if we let it go unchecked,'' the mayor said. 
 The mayor's most striking remarks were about economic inequality, as he voiced views not widely articulated by his fellow Republicans.
 ''This society cannot go forward, the way we have been going forward, where the gap between the rich and the poor keeps growing,'' said Mr. Bloomberg, a former Democrat. ''It's not politically viable; it's not morally right; it's just not going to happen.'' 
 He blamed ''the abject failure of public education in this country'' as a major cause of inequality, arguing that too many young people had not been given the skills essential for a technologically advanced economy. 
 Responding to comments by Paul A. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman, about the country's low savings rate and the ''top-heavy'' concentration of prosperity in the financial industry, the mayor said, ''China is investing in factories in Eastern Europe, not because their labor costs are lower, but because they want to be closer to their markets. We're not doing that. They're buying natural resources in Africa. They're trying to buy up the whole continent. We're not doing that. We're not making the investments for our future.'' 
 After the mayor's initial remarks, Robert E. Rubin, a former Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, told the audience: ''I was most interested in Mike Bloomberg raising this to another level. He sounded like he's doing what a presidential candidate would do. But in any event, I'm going to leave that aside because I'm subject to his jurisdiction.'' Laughter erupted. 
 Christopher Cox, a Republican who is chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, introduced Mr. Bloomberg by saying the mayor had won re-election with extraordinary support -- for a Republican.
 Asked after the panel if the mayor should run for the White House, Mr. Cox said with a smile, ''As the head of an independent agency, I no longer comment on politics, but I thought he did a terrific job on the panel.'' 
 Then he joked, ''Maybe this will get something started.''
 Mr. Bloomberg seemed to relish the attention. At a press conference afterward, he told reporters, ''I am not a candidate for president of the United States,'' but added, ''I'd be derelict in my duty if I didn't go and continue to use every advantage that I can to promote New York's cause.''

HEADLINE: Feeling Push for a Bigger Javits Expansion

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
So what does Gov. Eliot Spitzer want in a revamped Jacob K. Javits Convention Center?
 As details began trickling out from a meeting he had with city officials and Senator Charles E. Schumer on Monday, a clearer picture is emerging: he wants to redraw the current plans favored by the city and expand the center to the north and south. His proposal would make the Javits Center even larger.
The Bloomberg administration, which wants the Javits Center revamped quickly as a keystone for its ambitious plans for the Far West Side, is dismayed, asserting in an internal memo that the governor's proposal would add more than $1 billion to the cost of the project and delay completion by up to six years. 
 All the participants in Monday's meetings have declined to comment until the Spitzer administration finishes its proposal sometime next month. But the competing views have been clear for weeks.
 Patrick J. Foye, the state's economic development chief, was unambiguous last week in saying that the current expansion plan has a hefty $1.8 billion price tag, but provides too little new exhibition and meeting space to attract more trade shows and conventions to the city.
 According to officials and executives who have been briefed on the Monday meeting, the Spitzer administration would make way for a larger expansion -- up to 350,0000 square feet of additional exhibition and meeting room space -- by demolishing the Quill bus garage at 41st Street and 11th Avenue and building underground meeting rooms on the convention center's truck marshalling yard, on the south side of the Javits Center.
 ''That would be fantastic,'' exclaimed Jeff Little, whose company produces many of the largest public shows and trade shows at the Javits. ''It's a plan the users would support.''
 Mr. Little, other trade show managers and executives from the New York International Automobile Show have been increasingly vocal in their criticism of the vertical nature of the expansion project, which they say would increase the cost of shows in New York and undercut the city's ability to compete with other locations. 
 City officials, backed by the hotel industry and some labor unions, have countered that the plan makes the best use of limited space in a crowded city. Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff has called them together for a March 28 meeting to discuss the competing expansion plans.
 ''Everybody agrees that the expansion is not perfect,'' said Edward Malloy, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York. But, ''as an industry I think we're a little frustrated. This has been going on for so many years.'' 
 So it goes for that most rare of all New York phenomena, an expensive project with virtually no opposition. Somehow over the last decade it has never quite gotten off the ground, hobbled by political rivalries, political missteps and sharp disagreements over how best to expand the black glass behemoth that squats along 11th Avenue between 34th and 38th Streets. 
 When the Javits Center opened in 1986, it was smaller than originally planned and had little parking and no public transportation. It has 760,000 square feet of exhibit space and only 30,000 square feet of meeting space. Despite those shortcomings, which today include a leaky roof and an inadequate air-conditioning system, the center is one of the busiest convention halls in the country.
 The current expansion plan calls for extending the center two blocks north, to 40th Street, and adding a new floor for a ballroom that would double as meeting and exhibit space. The Police Department has also imposed security measures that have increased the cost of construction by $100 million. But the size of the expansion has been cut to a total of 1.05 million square feet of exhibit and meeting space, from 1.3 million a year ago.
 Many of the complaints about the current plan, however, stem from the city's insistence on moving the truck marshalling yard at the south end of Javits to a new multistory garage that would be built between 39th and 40th Streets. Proponents say the garage would get trucks off the streets and permit security screening, while the old marshalling yard could be sold for as much as $400 million for residential and commercial towers.
 Critics complain that the garage eats up space that should be used for exhibit halls and would be a bottleneck for trucks loading and unloading exhibits, while also driving up the cost of producing a trade show.
 In trying to devise a plan that would allow a larger expansion and satisfy many of the convention center's users, the Spitzer administration is now proposing to use the block between 33rd and 34th Streets, along 11th Avenue, for meeting room space and possibly security screening, according to executives and officials briefed on the state's plans. The state would offset the cost by selling the development rights over the parcel to developers for high-rise buildings.
 The Spitzer administration also eventually wants to demolish the Quill garage at 11th Avenue and 41st Street to enable a more horizontal expansion of the Javits Center. State officials have discussed the matter with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority but have not yet found a new spot for the garage.
 But city officials questioned the wisdom of those proposals in a memo on Friday from Mr. Doctoroff's office and played down criticisms from trade show managers. The memo estimates that it would cost an additional $800 million to demolish the Quill garage and build a new structure. With construction costs rising at the rate of $17 million a month, the memo says that delays could cost about $200 million a year.
 ''The realities are that these buildings are very expensive,'' said Jonathan M. Tisch, chairman of Loews Hotels and of the city's convention and visitors bureau. ''Somebody's got to pay for them. But nobody is arguing the merits of the governor's, the senator's or even the mayor's intentions to build the best building we can afford and keep to a schedule that is already long overdue.''

HEADLINE: Answering Latin Left, Bush Pledges to Help Poor

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and LARRY ROHTER; Jim Rutenberg reported from Merida, and Larry Rohter from Buenos Aires. James C. McKinley Jr. contributed reporting from Merida and Simon Romero from Caracas, Venezuela.

DATELINE: MERIDA, Mexico, March 13 

 BODY:
In the slums of Brazil, in the impoverished villages of Guatemala and finally here in Mexico, President Bush promised this week to deliver ''social justice'' to poor and struggling Latin Americans left behind by the global economy.
 Mr. Bush's striking use of the revolutionary language of the left reflected an urgent attempt to stave off the growing regional influence of populist leaders like President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, who have used the discontent of the poor to push an anti-American agenda.
Mr. Bush's tour, Latin American analysts say, signifies a new phase in a post-cold-war struggle for allegiance in South and Central America -- regions that have fallen out of focus in Washington as Mr. Bush has pursued two wars and a wider campaign against terrorism in the Middle East. 
 ''At the fall of the Berlin Wall it seemed like Latin America was off limits to the enemies of the United States,'' said Alvaro Vargas Llosa, director of the Center on Global Prosperity at the Independent Institute, a Washington-based group that promotes free trade. ''Now, if Latin America goes the Chavez way in a pretty heavy way, clearly it's going to be in play again.'' 
 Throughout the tour, Mr. Bush and his aides have bristled at what they have described as undue attention to Mr. Chavez in the news media as the Venezuelan leader, whose name Mr. Bush refuses to utter, has staged a competing tour this week. 
 Mr. Bush has shown open annoyance at suggestions that he has turned his back on this region, which he says ignore increases in United States aid and various humanitarian efforts during his tenure.
 But aides acknowledged that the widespread anti-American feeling was hard to ignore -- late Tuesday afternoon, for example, about 2,000 protesters tried to storm the United States Embassy in Mexico City. 
 Even Mr. Bush's host here, President Felipe Calderon of Mexico -- who narrowly won election last year against a leftist whom Mr. Calderon portrayed as being in the mold of Mr. Chavez -- said at a welcoming ceremony that in spite of Mr. Bush's pledge to make the relationship with Mexico a priority, ''unfortunately, the terrible happenings against the United States people, in a very understandable way, made the priorities change.''
 Nearly every move by Mr. Bush this week has seemed to be aimed at countering Mr. Chavez's message promoting the nationalization of industry and a severing of economic ties with the United States. 
 Mr. Bush has made stops highlighting American attempts to alleviate conditions for the poor in friendly nations -- Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico -- that were chosen to illustrate how they have made what administration officials considered ''the right choices'' in pursuing democracy and trade with the United States.
 Pointing to American efforts to provide medical treatment to those who cannot afford it, Mr. Bush on Monday visited a makeshift military medical outpost serving poor Guatemalan villagers. He later spent time loading lettuce into a truck at a Guatemalan produce cooperative built with help from Usaid. In all of his stops, he has made a case that free trade with the United States will lift all boats and alleviate poverty if given a chance.
 But the question, Latin American analysts say, is whether the effort will be large enough, or sustained enough, to make a difference as the frustration of the poor continues to grow as they watch their wealthier neighbors, who benefit from free trade, buy fancy new homes and as Land Rover dealerships go up next to their shantytowns.
 Mr. Chavez has continued to up the ante on Mr. Bush this week, talking, for example, of investing $2.5 billion to build an oil refinery in Nicaragua while making an appearance there with the newly re-elected president, Daniel Ortega -- the former Sandinista guerrilla leader who has returned to power and whose appearance with Mr. Chavez at a rally this week was a sign of his possible allegiance. 
 American assistance pales beside such sums. In an interview here on Tuesday, Rossana Fuentes-Berain, the opinion page editor for the newspaper El Universal, contrasted the $1.6 billion the United States gives in aid to the region annually with the cost of the Iraq war -- and the sums Mr. Chavez is spending. 
 ''Carrying around boxes of lettuce in a colorful Guatemalan coat is not my definition of showing that he's willing to do poverty alleviation,'' Ms. Fuentes-Berain said of Mr. Bush's stop at the produce cooperative in Guatemala.
 She said Mr. Bush was perhaps too much of a ''polarizing figure'' to deliver a powerful message here because of the war in Iraq -- which has echoes in the region of the United States' past interventions in Central and South America. Also, Mr. Bush's signature on a bill creating a 700-mile fence along the southern United States border has stoked protest here.
 Those protests have been fierce, with Mr. Bush being taunted by signs and graffiti calling him a ''murderer'' and a ''fascist,'' with a uniformity that aides to Mr. Bush say indicates the unseen hand of Mr. Chavez and his allies.
 Officials traveling with Mr. Bush acknowledged the sense among the region's poor that the benefits of trade deals with the United States have not trickled down to them, which creates an opportunity for Mr. Chavez and his allies.
 ''For close to 20 years of democratic processes and rhetoric about the benefits of democracy and free markets, the average person is waking up and saying, how's my life gotten better?'' said a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity. ''This is a fair question, and Hugo Chavez has come along at that unique moment.''
 The official added, ''There is a perception that the United States has been disengaged and distracted, and that works on a number of levels -- which stresses the importance of this trip and doing what we're doing in terms of the outreach.''
 For all of the frequent complaints from White House aides that the news media have made too much of Mr. Chavez this week, the Venezuelan leader's activities have also given greater attention to what Mr. Bush is doing in the region.
 As White House aides point out, Mr. Chavez's neighbors may be happy to take his money, but many remain wary and wonder if his act is not wearing thin. Despite all the disdain and insults he directed Mr. Bush's way, Mr. Chavez also seemed to recognize that he faces a significant new challenge from the United States. ''We cannot underestimate the new imperialist offensive that is coming at us,'' he said Sunday night in a speech in Leon, Nicaragua. ''We have to prepare ourselves to defeat it.''
 In another speech Friday in Buenos Aires, Mr. Chavez also accused Mr. Bush of trying to destroy Mercosur, the South American trade alliance that Brazil and Argentina founded more than 15 years ago. American officials have denied having any such intention, but the combined impact of the Bush and Chavez trips is to deepen the divisions that have recently emerged in the group.
 In another indication of the trip's potential to redraw power relations, Mr. Chavez reacted with hostility to plans by the United States and Brazil, the world's two largest producers of ethanol, to establish an alliance to increase output of ethanol and other biofuels, which United States officials hope will one day serve to undercut reliance on oil that is Mr. Chavez's main source of power here.
 Mr. Chavez offered the region an alternative to ethanol: natural gas, a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than oil. Venezuela, of course, has Latin America's largest natural gas reserves, followed by those of Bolivia, where the administration of President Evo Morales is a close ally of Mr. Chavez.
 Mr. Morales is a central member of Mr. Chavez's political bloc in the region, which also includes Cuba, Ecuador and, to a lesser degree, Peru and Nicaragua.
 But officials said Mr. Bush's visit was also meant to highlight ties to other important nations in the region like Brazil, Uruguay, Guatemala, Colombia and Mexico -- some of whom also have relationships with Mr. Chavez, but ''all of whom,'' said Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, ''share our goals of democracy, all of whom share our goals of free markets, all of whom appreciate America's role in the region.'' 
 And he said the president's tour ''made it clear the United States may not have gotten the credit it deserves'' in the region.

HEADLINE: Britain Drafts Laws to Slash Carbon Emissions

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, March 13 

 BODY:
As nations and politicians in many parts of Europe compete to burnish their green credentials, Britain on Tuesday became the first national government to propose binding laws enforcing a steep cut in carbon emissions, in this case a 60 percent decrease by 2050.
 If approved, the draft Climate Change Bill could affect many Britons in many ways. Officials might be summoned to appear before judges for failing to meet targets, households could be pressed to switch to low-energy light bulbs and install home insulation, and manufacturers could be asked to build TV sets without standby modes that consume energy when the devices are not in use. 
Indeed, in a land enamored of cars, the internal combustion engine and regular low-cost flights to sunnier climes, some of the measures could be unpopular with voters even as they inspire politicians' acclaim. 
 ''This bill is an international landmark,'' the environment minister, David Miliband, told reporters. ''It is the first time any country has set itself legally binding carbon targets. It is an environmental contract for future generations.''
 Although the global warming caused by Britain is considered modest, the nation has striven to put itself at the forefront of efforts to address what Prime Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday called ''the biggest long-term threat facing our world.'' The British draft law was announced only days after the European Union committed itself to a 20 percent cut in carbon emissions by 2020, but Britain went far beyond that target, setting for itself a reduction of 26 to 32 percent in the same time frame.
 British politicians insist that the draft law may become the harbinger of what Mr. Blair, in a meeting with teenagers at his 10 Downing Street office on Tuesday, labeled a revolution in Britons' approach to how they drive, heat their homes, run their businesses and schedule vacation flights. The draft law also foresaw a carbon trading system and the creation of five-year ''carbon budgets'' planned 15 years ahead to enable businesses and individuals to shape their behavior to a greener Britain.
 A committee would be established to make annual assessments of the government's progress, or lack of it. 
 ''A government that fails to meet the requirement under the bill to live within its environmental means will be subject to a judicial review,'' Mr. Miliband said. ''It will be for the courts to decide what sanctions to apply.''
 Government leaders are planning to enact the law by next year, one year ahead of the next national election, likely in 2009. ''This is a revolutionary step in confronting climate change,'' Mr. Blair said. ''It sets an example to the rest of the world.'' 
 Climate change is expected to be a central issue in national elections, likely to be fought by the conservative leader, David Cameron, and Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, who is expected to take over from Mr. Blair as Labor Party leader and prime minister sometime this summer.
 On Monday, both Mr. Cameron and Mr. Brown offered claims to environmental virtue. Mr. Cameron, who laid claim to the green mantle last year when he was photographed on a dog sled in the Arctic and cycled to his office, was shown in news clips on Monday digging to plant a tree.
 But in the sound bite stakes, Mr. Blair trumped both Mr. Brown and Mr. Cameron, appearing in a satellite hookup with the California governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to extol the virtues of fighting global warming on the evening news. 
 Mr. Brown, for his part, gave a speech outlining incentives for householders to curb energy use. ''I'm greener than you,'' the conservative Daily Mail said in a headline over photographs of both politicians. Mr. Cameron has taken what some columnists describe as a risky step by suggesting new taxes on airline travel, possibly alienating some 400,000 Britons with second homes outside the country who fly regularly -- often on low-cost airlines -- to visit their properties. The conservative leader is also pressing for annual, not five-year, targets for reduced carbon emissions. 
 The government proposal fell short of demands by some environmental groups for an 80 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2050. 
 Both the British and European proposals lay out schedules for reducing so-called greenhouse gases far beyond the expirations of the Kyoto Protocol, which the United States has signed but President Bush has rejected. China and India, with their booming economies, are also primary polluters, but Mr. Miliband, the British environment minister, said the new British law would give Britain authority to persuade other lands to follow its lead.
 But there were dissenting voices. In Tuesday's Evening Standard, a columnist, Nirpal Dhaliwal, said there was ''more than a whiff of colonial condescension about British politicians' attitudes to developing world industrialization.'' 
 He said Britain's share of global carbon emissions was very low -- around 2 percent -- while China was building a new coal-burning power station every two weeks. ''We could decide to live in the Stone Age burning nothing, and it would have virtually no impact on the overall problem of global warming,'' he wrote.

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Offer Spending Plan, but No Way to Pay for It

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13 

 BODY:
Senate Democrats have drafted a budget that would reject President Bush's spending cuts for health care and education, would keep taxes low and would eliminate the deficit by 2012.
 There is only one catch: they cannot say where all the money will come from.
In an opening bid to reshape spending and tax policy, Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee will start work on Wednesday on an overall budget they say will reject many of the spending cuts that President Bush laid out in his budget last month. 
 The Democrats' plan calls for spending $50 billion more over the next five years for health care for children in low-income families. It would increase spending on veterans' care by more than $3 billion over five years. 
 But the most costly initiative would be to keep taxes low. The plan includes a two-year freeze on the alternative minimum tax, a parallel tax that was originally intended for millionaires but is not adjusted for inflation and is set to apply to tens of millions of families if it is not changed. 
 A two-year freeze could cost the government nearly $200 billion, according to Congressional analysts, and eliminating the tax entirely would cost more than $1 trillion over 10 years.
 House Democrats have similarly ambitious plans, and plan to start work on their own budget resolution next week. 
 In both chambers, Democrats are imposing tough new rules known as pay-go that require lawmakers to pay for new spending or new tax cuts with savings or tax increases in other areas.
 ''Our budget will be more fiscally responsible than the president's and at the same time we will reject his painful cuts to critical services,'' said Thomas Kahn, chief of staff for the House Budget Committee.
 But at least in the case of the Senate plan, many of the hardest decisions would be postponed until later in the decade. 
 The Senate plan would create what lawmakers call reserve funds, which would cover most of the increased spending for children's health care as well as the cost of extending most of Mr. Bush's tax cuts.
 But the so-called funds are not funds in any normal sense. Rather, they represent a statement of intentions by lawmakers to raise the necessary money, through either spending cuts or tax increases, by the time it would be necessary to spend it.
 ''It's more about political positioning than actual budgeting,'' said Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group that champions increased fiscal discipline. 
 Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said about $35 billion in projected spending for children's health care would be covered by a reserve fund. A much bigger reserve fund would be established to pay for an extension of Mr. Bush's tax cuts, most of which are now set to expire at the end of 2010.
 ''We believe some of the tax cuts will be extended, perhaps all of them,'' Mr. Conrad told reporters on Tuesday. But only, he added, ''if there is money to pay for them.''
 The Senate's budget resolution is unlikely to offer any insight about where the money will come from. Mr. Conrad and other Democrats are placing high hopes on recovering some $300 billion a year that the Internal Revenue Service estimates it loses from people and companies that underreport their incomes.
 Mr. Conrad said one source of revenue, though he did not know how much, could come from cracking down on corporations and wealthy individuals who hide income in offshore tax havens. But he conceded that the reducing the so-called tax gap would not provide enough money on its own.
 Both Mr. Conrad and Representative John Spratt, Democrat of South Carolina and chairman of the House Budget Committee, said they were opposed to raising taxes. But they are not opposed to what they call tax reform, which could well lead to tax increases for some people and corporations.
 To offset the cost of reining in the alternative minimum tax, for example, some Democrats want to roll back Mr. Bush's tax cuts for the top 1 percent of income-earners. Others are pushing to eliminate many corporate tax breaks, and the House has already voted to repeal about $7.6 billion in breaks for oil companies.

HEADLINE: A U.S. Alliance to Update the Light Bulb

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13 

 BODY:
A coalition of industrialists, environmentalists and energy specialists is banding together to try to eliminate the incandescent light bulb in about 10 years.
 In an agreement to be announced Wednesday, the coalition members, including Philips Lighting, the largest manufacturer; the Natural Resources Defense Council; and two efficiency organizations, are pledging to press for efficiency standards at the local, state and federal levels. The standards would phase out the ordinary screw-in bulb, technology that arose around the time of the telegraph and the steam locomotive, and replace it with compact fluorescents, light-emitting diodes, halogen devices and other technologies that may emerge.
 Compact fluorescents are three times as efficient as old-fashioned bulbs, and light-emitting diodes six times as efficient. These also last much longer. But while they cost much less to run, they are more expensive to purchase, and getting home users to change the bulbs in the estimated four billion sockets in the United States would probably require eliminating the choice. 
 James E. Rogers, chief executive of Duke Energy and the co-chairman of one of the efficiency organizations in the coalition, the Alliance to Save Energy, said in a statement, ''Encouraging our customers to use advanced compact fluorescent light bulbs and other energy-efficient lighting is fundamental to our plans to meet growing demand for electricity as economically as possible.'' 
 The agreement is a compromise among the participants. Some favored an outright ban on incandescent bulbs, like the one Australia said last month it would seek by 2009 or 2010. Philips, a unit of Royal Philips Electronics of the Netherlands, has pledged with others doing business in Europe to seek a shift to more efficient lighting there, too.
 The announcement planned Wednesday in Washington will commit coalition members to seek ''a market phaseout'' by 2016.
 General Electric, the largest American manufacturer of lighting, has recently been campaigning against the elimination of incandescent bulbs, and promising instead to bring out a new model that is twice as efficient as its current bulbs. The company is not part of the new coalition. But it has allied itself with the Natural Resources Defense Council in another group called the United States Carbon Action Program, which seeks to control emissions of greenhouse gases through energy conservation.
 Noah Horowitz, a scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said his group favored a performance standard, like the ones already in place for appliances like refrigerators, that would effectively require manufacturers to give up the traditional bulb. ''We've given up a sound bite, 'ban the incandescent,' as opposed to a phaseout of the incandescent and a move to more efficient lighting,'' Mr. Horowitz said, adding that the reason was to avoid angering consumers.
 Replacing incandescent lamps could slow the growth in greenhouse-gas emissions, but not radically. About 22 percent of electricity is used for lighting, and about 42 percent of that is now generated by incandescent bulbs, according to the organizers. That means that a little over 9 percent of all electricity is used in incandescent bulbs. If that figure were cut by half, it would be equivalent to two or three years of growth in electric demand. Replacing older fluorescent lamps with newer, more efficient ones would help, too. 
 The participants say that a complete phaseout would save $18 billion a year in electricity, and save the amount of power that would be produced by 30 nuclear reactors or as many as 80 coal plants. It would also eliminate substantial mercury emissions from the coal plants, they said. 
 The Australian government said on Feb. 20 that it would seek to ban incandescent bulbs and replace them with compact fluorescents. Shortly thereafter, the environment minister of Ontario, Laurel Broten, said her province was considering a similar step, and a California assemblyman, Lloyd Levine, introduced a bill to do the same.
 ''Incandescent light bulbs were first developed almost 125 years ago,'' Mr. Levine said, ''and since that time they have undergone no major modifications.'' 
 Kathleen Rogers, president of the Earth Day Network, one of the groups in the alliance seeking to end the use of incandescent bulbs, predicted, ''I think you're going to see these disparate efforts adding up to this great tidal wave.'' The problem, she said, was that ''the incandescent spends most of its life making heat, not light.''
 But General Electric, which traces its origins to Edison, said that could change. 
 ''It's shortsighted to freeze technology in favor of today's high-efficiency compact fluorescent lamps,'' the company said in a statement. ''We'd rather keep innovating and offering traditional, commercial and industrial consumers more energy-efficient choices -- not fewer choices.''
 Alexander A. Karsner, the assistant secretary of energy for efficiency and renewables, said that the government could theoretically force the change. ''Government has a legislative hammer in the toolbox,'' he said. ''But to be prescriptive on the next product technology is probably not a way we want to go.''
 Setting a performance standard would be better, he said, because that would allow the industry to comply with whatever technology it could best provide.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 17, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Wednesday about a coalition of industrialists, environmentalists and energy specialists who are trying to eliminate the incandescent light bulb misstated the name of a business-environmental group that cooperates on global warming issues. It is the United States Climate Action Partnership, not the United States Carbon Action Program.

HEADLINE: Moving Faster on Refrigerant Chemicals

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, March 14 

 BODY:
An unusual coalition of industrial and developing countries began pushing Wednesday for stringent limits on the world's most popular refrigerant for air-conditioners, as evidence mounts that the refrigerant harms the earth's ozone layer and contributes to global warming.
 The coalition is pitted against China, which has become the world's leading manufacturer of air-conditioners that use the refrigerant, HCFC-22. Most window air-conditioners and air-conditioning systems in the United States use this refrigerant, as well.
International pressure has grown rapidly this winter for quick action. ''We scientifically have proof: if we accelerate the phaseout of HCFC, we are going to make a great contribution to climate change,'' said Romina Picolotti, the chief of Argentina's environmental secretariat.
 An accelerated phaseout of the refrigerant could speed up by five years the healing of the ozone layer of the atmosphere. It could also cut emissions of global-warming gases by the equivalent of at least one-sixth of the reductions called for under the Kyoto Protocol. 
 The United States joined Argentina, Brazil, Iceland, Mauritania and Norway on Wednesday in notifying the Ozone Secretariat of the United Nations Environment Program that they want to negotiate an accelerated phaseout of hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFC's, at an international conference in Montreal in September. 
 The conference is tied to the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Montreal Protocol, which has reduced emissions of most ozone-depleting gases but left a loophole for HCFC-22 production by developing countries. China has repeatedly said it will honor all current rules of the Montreal Protocol but does not want to add new ones. 
 Recent studies have shown that steeply rising production of HCFC-22 by China, India and other developing countries has slowed the healing of the ozone layer, which protects humans, animals and vegetation from the sun's dangerous ultraviolet rays.
 A report last week by five American and European scientists found that sharp cutbacks in emissions of ozone-depleting gases since 1987 have been far more effective in combating global warming than the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 agreement that was aimed directly at limiting climate change.
 HCFC's and other ozone-depleting gases are extremely powerful warming gases. Gram for gram, the ones used as refrigerants have thousands of times the global-warming effect of carbon dioxide. The ozone-depleting gases are released in far smaller quantities, though, than carbon dioxide, which is emitted when fossil fuels are burned by vehicle engines, power plants and other users.
 The report by the European and American experts, published last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that the Montreal Protocol had proved to be 5.5 times as effective as the Kyoto accord was intended to be in cutting emissions of global-warming gases. The Montreal agreement has been in force much longer and applies to developing and industrial nations alike, while the Kyoto Protocol has binding limits only for industrial nations.
 The report has caught the attention of countries in the Pacific and Indian Oceans that fear that global warming will lead to a rise in sea levels and a significant loss of their limited land.
 ''As small island nations, our main concern is that whatever touches the climate has to be dealt with fairly quickly,'' said Sateeaved Seebaluck, permanent secretary in the environment ministry of Mauritius, an island nation well east of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
 Mr. Seebaluck said that a flurry of news reports about HCFC-22 this winter had been widely e-mailed among specialists and had led to greatly increased international interest in addressing the problem.
 The Montreal Protocol currently allows developing countries to keep increasing their production of HCFC-22 until 2016, and then freezes production at that level until 2040, when it is supposed to be halted. But that schedule was devised in the early 1990s, when HCFC-22 was used mainly in industrial nations; developing countries were seen as too poor ever to afford much of the chemical.
 The Kyoto Protocol then exempted HCFC-22 and other ozone-depleting substances from production and consumption limits on the grounds that the Montreal agreement had already addressed those matters.
 Use of HCFC-22 has soared in the third world with the economic growth of China, India and other countries, along with the sharp drop in air-conditioner costs that has accompanied China's growing skill in making them cheaply. Mr. Seebaluck said Mauritius's use of HCFC-22 had risen more than 100-fold in the last six years because of a boom in hotel construction and the rapid expansion of the fishing industry, which uses a lot of refrigeration to preserve freshness.
 The use in India and China, far larger markets, has been rising as much as 35 percent a year lately, with specialists predicting that similar growth could last through 2016.
 Industrial nations are required to phase out HCFC-22 by 2020, but most are moving faster. The European Union phased it out in 2004. The United States will ban domestic production in 2010 and is considering whether to ban imports then, as well.
 China has begun making air-conditioners with more modern refrigerants for the European market. But by continuing to produce HCFC-22 for markets elsewhere, the Chinese have been able to claim hundreds of millions of dollars a year in payments from an obscure United Nations agency.
 The payments are to compensate Chinese chemical factories for incinerating a waste gas generated as part of the manufacturing process for HCFC-22. If the Chinese industry switches to modern refrigerants, it would no longer produce the waste gas and so would lose the credits.
 India has a large and growing HCFC-22 industry that is also reaping a fortune in credits. But the Indian government has largely stayed on the sidelines in international talks, while China has called for industrial nations to pay even more for the incineration of waste gases from HCFC-22 production; China proposes to spend much of that to develop its renewable-energy industry.
 A big problem is that no one has agreed what should replace HCFC-22. The chemicals requiring the fewest changes to air-conditioner designs avoid harm to the ozone layer but are still as potent, gram for gram, in terms of global warming.
 Mack McFarland, chief atmospheric scientist at DuPont, said the company had developed a chemical that also has little effect on global warming. But the chemical is suitable only for vehicle air-conditioners, not the building air-conditioners that now rely on HCFC-22.
 Environmentalists contend that chemical companies and air-conditioner makers are too slow to embrace other refrigerants, like ammonia or carbon dioxide, that may pose technical challenges but could be better for the ozone layer and global warming.
 ''Industry certainly is somewhat concerned about some of those chemicals because some of them don't promise a lot of profits,'' said Alexander von Bismarck, campaigns director of the Environmental Investigation Agency, a Washington advocacy group.
 David Doniger, climate policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that even switching to new commercial refrigerants that are potent global-warming agents could help the environment. Air-conditioners designed for the new refrigerants tend to be more energy-efficient and often do not use as much refrigerant, he said.

HEADLINE: When to Violate the Top Two Commandments of Antigovernment Crusaders

BYLINE: By Robert H. Frank. 
Robert H. Frank, an economist at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University, is the author of ''The Economic Naturalist,'' which will be published this spring. Contact: www.robert-h-frank.com.

 BODY:
When asked to identify the two most important items from their list of 10 public policy commandments, most antigovernment crusaders pick (1) public spending shall be kept to an absolute minimum and (2) the state shall not transfer income from rich to poor. 
 No government heeds these admonitions in any literal sense. Yet they have had a profound impact on public policy decisions, especially in the United States. Often, however, their impact has been the opposite of what antigovernment crusaders intended. 
The problem is that many compellingly advantageous public policies cannot be enacted without violating the two commandments. Every significant policy change benefits some people and harms others. If the gains to winners substantially outweigh the costs to losers, solutions can always be found that allow everyone to come out ahead. But those solutions often involve higher taxes and income transfers to the poor.
 Regulations that limit auto emissions are a case in point. Because these regulations increase car prices, legislators in most jurisdictions exempt older vehicles to avoid imposing unacceptable costs on the mostly low-income motorists who drive them. Yet the cost to society of this exemption far outweighs its benefit for the poor.
 For example, although fewer than 10 percent of the vehicles in Los Angeles are more than 15 years old, these cars account for more than half the smog. Exempting the old cars thus necessitates much stricter regulations for new ones. But the cheapest ways of reducing emissions from new cars have long since been adopted. According to a RAND Corporation study, meeting air quality targets by further tightening new-car standards is several times as costly as meeting those targets by eliminating the exemption for older vehicles. 
 By raising taxes on high-income motorists, the government could finance vouchers that would enable low-income motorists to scrap their older vehicles in favor of cleaner used cars of more recent vintage. The required taxes would be much smaller than the resulting savings from not having to adopt such costly standards for new vehicles. Both rich and poor motorists would win.
 The problem is that taking these steps would violate the two commandments. Antigovernment crusaders have prevailed for now. The ostensible champions of economic efficiency, they have kept government budgets smaller and blocked some transfers to low-income families. In the process, however, they have made everyone poorer.
 Some believe that minimal government is synonymous with economic efficiency. But it is not. As the emissions example illustrates, economic efficiency sometimes requires that government play a larger role. 
 This example is part of a much broader pattern. In health care, for example, the private insurance system employed in the United States delivers worse outcomes at substantially higher cost than the single-payer system employed in virtually every other industrial country. But switching to the single-payer system would require higher taxes and increased benefits for low-income citizens, steps that would violate the two commandments. So for now, we remain saddled with a system that everyone agrees is dysfunctional.
 In the realm of antipoverty policy, most economists agree that raising the earned-income tax credit would be the most efficient way of increasing the living standard of the working poor. Under this program, general tax revenues support income subsidies to those whose earnings fall below a given threshold. Its compelling advantage is that unlike a higher minimum wage, it does not discourage hiring. But raising taxes to increase the earned-income tax credit would violate the two commandments. 
 Because the most efficient antipoverty policy is deemed politically unfeasible, many economists support current legislative proposals to raise the minimum wage for the first time in a decade. If this legislation passes, antigovernment crusaders will be able to claim, truthfully, to have prevented an increase in the federal budget. But they will have won a hollow victory. For unlike an increase in the earned-income tax credit, an increase in the minimum wage not only limits job creation for the least- skilled workers, it also raises the prices of goods they produce. Over all, it would have been cheaper to raise the earned-income tax credit. 
 Antigovernment crusaders have also prevented the adoption of energy policies that would produce better outcomes for all. For example, economists of all political stripes have argued that a stiff tax on gasoline would relieve traffic congestion, reduce greenhouse gases, accelerate the development of energy-saving technologies and reduce dependence on foreign oil. But it would also impose significant economic hardship on low-income families, making it necessary to increase transfer payments to those families. Both the tax on gasoline and the transfers to low-income families would be clear violations of the two commandments. And so gasoline taxes continue to be far lower in the United States than in other industrial countries.
 That democratic forces limit the economic hardship that government can impose on low-income families is a good thing. But sometimes imposing hardships on those families would create far larger gains for society as a whole. In such cases, we can always devise solutions that make everyone better off. But it is impossible to put these solutions into practice without violating the two commandments. 
 Is it better to solve a problem by spending two extra dollars in the private sector than by spending one additional dollar in the public sector? The two commandments insist, preposterously, that it is. 
 Economic efficiency is a worthy goal because when the economic pie grows larger, everyone can have a larger slice than before. Antigovernment crusaders deserve credit for emphasizing the importance of this goal. But as events of recent years have repeatedly demonstrated, they are often the biggest obstacles to its achievement.

HEADLINE: Hedge Funds, the Usual Suspects, Blamed for Volatility in Asia

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS; Wayne Arnold contributed reporting from Singapore.

 BODY:
The recent volatility and pullback in Asian markets have prompted some investors to sound a familiar refrain: It's all the fault of the hedge funds. 
 In the last two years, dozens of these funds have set up shop in Asia hoping to find relatively hidden lucrative opportunities, as markets in Europe and the United States become more crowded and competitive. Their trading in equity markets has grown sharply: they were responsible for 22 percent of the brokerage commissions paid on Asian cash equity trades in 2006, up from 5 percent in 2004, according to Greenwich Associates.
Many small traders and brokers in the region argue that the growing influence of hedge funds in Asia has exaggerated market movements, particularly the declines that rocked global markets recently. They also say the funds contribute to higher volatility in the Asian equity markets. 
 Hedge funds are going to create even more unpredictable gyrations in the future, making things still more difficult for other investors, they say. 
 Yesterday, markets across Asia fell again on worries about the Western markets and the outlook for the American economy, with the Nikkei average in Tokyo falling 2.92 percent. 
 Regulators are keeping a close eye on these funds. Market regulators from Britain and Hong Kong are meeting Indian regulators in Mumbai in April to discuss hedge fund participation in markets. It is the first time India has been host of such a roundtable. 
 A fifteenfold increase in market capitalization on Vietnam's stock market recently ignited fears among regional market analysts that Vietnamese regulators would impose capital controls to start shutting out foreign investors. 
 Aggressive hedge fund managers normally take positions intended to profit from a market decline if they anticipate one. Many say that the correction in late February was widely expected. In December, fund managers in Asia say they had begun warning of an imminent slide in markets. 
 What is surprising about the February drop, though, analysts said, was how few hedge fund managers appeared to have actually profited from the market declines. Instead, they seemed to have been trying to take advantage of the bull market for Asian stocks and bonds by buying aggressively. 
 Short selling, bets that certain stocks will fall, is not allowed in some Asian equity markets. But fund managers can mimic that strategy by using complicated financial derivatives and options to achieve the same effect. When stocks started to move down, though, investors jumped out, making drops even steeper. 
 Referring to the sell-off that began in late February, Henry To, investment adviser at MarketThoughts, said, ''At the height of the selling, money managers in Asia were remarking that they have not experienced this kind of selling intensity since the height of the Asia Crisis'' in 1997 and 1998. 
 A focus on hedge funds does not tell the whole story, though, emerging market veterans say. 
 ''The ferocity to which the market decline in China spilled over to the global markets is to some extent attributable to hedge funds,'' said Marc Faber, an investment adviser, nicknamed Dr. Doom for his bearish sentiments. ''But today, it is not just the hedge funds that act like hedge funds -- it is also the proprietary desks of banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.'' 
 Because the compensation of traders at these banks is based on short- term trading profits, ''when the market goes down they all sell,'' Mr. Faber said. 
 Wall Street investment banks have poured money and talent into proprietary trading desks in recent years, helping to earn record profits for their banks. Assets under management at these proprietary desks are difficult to quantify, but analysts at Keefe Bruyette & Woods estimate that these banks have more than doubled the amount of money in those businesses since 2001. 
 Other factors are also influencing the Asian equity markets. Hedge funds are ''a growing player, and arguably a shorter-term player,'' said Hugh Young, managing director at Aberdeen Asset Management Asia. ''But there is a lot of human emotion involved across the board,'' from both hedge funds, traditional funds and other investors. 
 A wide array of established hedge funds and the firms that service them are setting up shop or expanding operations in Asia, including K2 Advisors and Bisys Alternative Investment Services.
 In some thinly traded Asian markets, the influx of new capital can be felt keenly. 
 Trading volume of Asian interest rate derivatives tripled, to $414 billion, in 2006 from the year before, Greenwich said, and the amount of credit derivatives doubled to $67 billion. Greenwich Associates estimates that hedge funds account for 30 percent of the total trading in one of these assets, structured credit derivatives. 
 What is difficult is quantifying how each market participant adds to Asian volatility. ''Liquidity is an ephemeral concept at best,'' said Edmund Harriss, investment director at Guinness Atkinson Asset Managers and manager of three Asia-focused funds. 
 For example, estimates for the carry trade, where investors borrow yen at low interest rates and convert into other currencies to make investments in higher yielding markets, ''range from $100 billion to $600 billion, and we have no idea and can't measure it,'' Mr. Harriss said. 
 Rather than blaming hedge funds, ''we should take a step back and look at what is going on in equity markets generally: we should expect volatility in equity markets, period, and that is because we are not sure which way the economy is going to go,'' Mr. Harriss said. 
 Heavy-handed efforts to control foreign investment have proved disastrous for Asian regulators. Citing a flow of $1 billion into its bond market in a single week, Thailand's central bank imposed capital controls in December, a move that investors punished by sending the country's stock market down 7 percent in a single day. Thailand has since relaxed those controls.
 Policy makers in South Korea and the Philippines have relaxed restrictions on capital outflows to slow the appreciation of their currencies.

HEADLINE: Current-Account Deficit Shrinks

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14 

 BODY:
The current-account deficit shrank in the fourth quarter of 2006 to its smallest in more than a year as lower oil prices took a bite out of imports and exports continued to rise, a Commerce Department report showed on Wednesday. 
 The quarterly shortfall totaled $195.8 billion, below a midpoint estimate of $204 billion made by Wall Street analysts before the report. It was also the smallest since the third quarter of 2005, when it was $183.4 billion.
But the gap still set an annual record in 2006 at $856.7 billion, up more than 8 percent from 2005. It also set a record as a percentage of the overall economy, at 6.5 percent of gross domestic product, up from 6.4 percent in 2005.
 The current account is the broadest measure of America's trade with the rest of the world. It includes trade in goods, services and capital and financial flows, like foreign purchases of Treasury bonds to help finance the government's budget deficit.
 The fourth-quarter gap fell to 5.8 percent of gross domestic product, from 6.9 percent in the third quarter and a record 7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005.
 United States imports in the fourth quarter decreased to $464.6 billion, from $480.2 billion in the third quarter, as oil prices tumbled from highs earlier in the year.
 Exports increased to $266.6 billion, from $261.3 billion, led by exports of civilian aircraft and other capital goods, followed by consumer goods.
 United States investors made net purchases of a record $115.7 billion of foreign securities in the fourth quarter, up from $54.4 billion in the third quarter.
 A separate Labor Department report on Wednesday showed import price inflation pressure in February was ''tamer than expected,'' said Josh Stiles, bond strategist for IDEAglobal in New York. 
 Excluding volatile petroleum prices, import prices were down 0.1 percent. Petroleum import prices rose 2 percent.
 In a sliver of good news for the nation's beleaguered housing sector, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday that mortgage applications rose 2.8 percent last week as the lowest lending rates since December spurred activity.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Assembly Considers Legislation on Autism, Seen as Prevalent in the State

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY

DATELINE: NEWARK, March 14 

 BODY:
After a recent federal study showing New Jersey had the nation's highest per-capita prevalence of autism, the State Assembly is expected to approve a package of bills Thursday intended to improve early detection of the disorder, plan for better services for adults who have it, and finance the Governor's Council on Autism, created in 1999 to research causes of and treatments for autism-related disabilities.
 The package also asks the State Department of Health and Senior Services to further study the use of prenatal sonograms, in light of research suggesting a possible link between them and unusual neurological development in laboratory animals similar to features of the brains of autistic humans. 
Though some experts and statisticians have questioned the methods of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, which put New Jersey's autism rate at 10.6 per 1,000 8-year-olds -- far above the national average of 6.6 per 1,000 -- advocates for people with the disorder have welcomed the momentum and focus the study has brought. The legislative package could help cement New Jersey's growing reputation for being at the forefront of autism diagnosis and treatment.
 ''The timing is good for this,'' said Paul Potito, executive director of the Center for Outreach and Services for the Autism Community, based in Ewing. ''It's a really great opportunity for our community.''
 The package of seven bills, introduced by Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr., a Democrat, also would create a statewide autism registry and set a goal of detecting autism within a child's first three years. The legislation would provide training for pediatricians in detecting the disorder, and for teachers in recognizing its signs and working with autistic children in class. 
 One bill would restructure the governor's council, and another would create a separate task force on adults with autism to plan for their housing, job training and long-term care needs. Another calls for special training of police officers, firefighters and emergency medical technicians to recognize signs of autism. 
 The cost of the bills has not yet been determined, Mr. Roberts said. Gov. Jon S. Corzine has set aside $5 million for autism in the state's proposed $33.3 billion budget, but has not specified how it should be spent.
 ''It's clear that this is an enormous health care challenge in New Jersey, and it's also clear that early diagnosis and intervention give us the chance to use therapies and other interventions that can be enormously helpful to young children,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''New Jersey thus far has been on the cutting edge of the diagnosis and treatment of autism, and this allows us to build on the fine work that's already been done.''
 Last month's study by the C.D.C., covering specific regions in 14 states, showed New Jersey had the nation's highest prevalence of autism and related disorders, though some researchers say the higher rates here can be attributed to better records kept by New Jersey schools and clinics. Researchers in New Jersey had a median of eight diagnostic records available to them to determine whether a child had an autistic disorder, while researchers in Maryland, for instance, had two.
 New Jersey researchers looked only at Essex, Hudson, Union and Ocean Counties. Ocean County was chosen because parents in Brick Township had raised concerns about a high rate of autism and related disorders. The study looked at only those regions where researchers responded to a request for proposals; in addition to the four New Jersey counties, it examined the entire states of Alabama, Arkansas and West Virginia, and parts of 10 others, many of them predominantly urban.
 Some say these differences could mean that rather than New Jersey's appearing to have an unusually high rate of autism, the state's rate of more than 10 children out of every 1,000 could be closer to the true national average.
 Mr. Potito particularly welcomed the measures in the state legislation that focus on older autistic people.
 ''Most of the time, energy and money is spent in early intervention and for people of school age, so adults really fall into a black hole,'' he said. There is a need for high-quality behavioral and social services for adults, he said, ''instead of tossing people into workshops and hoping it works.''
 As for the cause of the disorder, Philip A. DeFina, the chief scientific officer for the International Brain Research Foundation, who has a practice in Basking Ridge, cited studies by researchers at Yale and in Sweden that showed disruption of fetal brain development in lab animals after ultrasounds, and a Minnesota study of autopsied brains of autistic children that found a similar pattern of abnormal nerve cell migration.
 ''People feel it is a very safe, nonthreatening procedure,'' he said of sonograms. ''However, there is preliminary scientific data that suggests it may cause significant changes in the brain's ability to organize itself during fetal development, possibly resulting in these kinds of disorders.''
 After speaking with Dr. DeFina, Assemblyman Joseph Pennacchio, a Republican representing parts of Morris and Passaic Counties, sponsored a resolution asking the health department to pull together any research on sonograms and autism, and to investigate whether any studies have been done comparing the general public and groups who do not use sonograms for religious or economic reasons. 
 ''I want to get the discourse started,'' Mr. Pennacchio said. ''Certainly this is an epidemic; we better get to the bottom of it.''

BYLINE: By Frank H. Stewart. 
Frank H. Stewart is a professor in the department of Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a visiting scholar at New York University.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
LAST summer, the Archbishop of Algeria remarked to this newspaper that when satellite dishes first appeared in Algeria, they were typically positioned to receive French broadcasts. Now the majority receive programming from the Persian Gulf.
 ''If you watch Western television, you live in one universe,'' said the archbishop, ''and if you watch Middle Eastern television, you live in another altogether.'' The Middle Eastern broadcasts, he added, tended to depict the West in a negative light.
Washington is well aware of this problem and has tried to address it. In 2004, the United States established its own Arabic-language satellite television station, Al Hurra. But Al Hurra has not been a success, and stations like Al Jazeera and Al Arabiyya, based in the Gulf states, continue to dominate the region. 
 Those stations will soon face a formidable rival. The BBC World Service plans to start an Arabic television service this fall, and the BBC knows what it is doing. It has been broadcasting in Arabic on the radio for more than 60 years and has a huge audience.
 This new television station might sound like good news for America. Many of us pick up BBC broadcasts in English, and we respect their quality. But the World Service in English is one thing, and the World Service in Arabic is another entirely. If the BBC's Arabic TV programs resemble its radio programs, then they will be just as anti-Western as anything that comes out of the Gulf, if not more so. They will serve to increase, rather than to diminish, tensions, hostilities and misunderstandings among nations.
 For example, a 50-minute BBC Arabic Service discussion program about torture discussed only one specific allegation, which came from the head of an organization representing some 90 Saudis imprisoned at Guantanamo. This speaker stated that the prisoners were subject to disgusting and horrible forms of torture and suggested that three inmates reported by the United States to have committed suicide were actually killed. Another participant insisted that the two countries guilty of torturing political prisoners on the largest scale were Israel and the United States.
 At the same time, the authoritarian regimes and armed militants of the Arab world get sympathetic treatment on BBC Arabic. When Saddam Hussein was in power, he was a great favorite of the service, which reported as straight news his re-election to a seven-year term in 2002, when he got 100 percent of the vote. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria enjoys similar favor. When a State Department representative referred to Syria as a dictatorship, his BBC interviewer immediately interrupted and reprimanded him.
 The Arabic Service not only shields Arab leaders from criticism but also tends to avoid topics they might find embarrassing: human rights, the role of military and security forces, corruption, discrimination against minorities, censorship, poverty and unemployment. When, from time to time, such topics do arise, they are usually dealt with in the most general terms: there may, for instance, be guarded references to ''certain Arab countries.''
 By contrast, the words and deeds of Western leaders, particularly the American president and the British prime minister, are subject to minute analysis, generally on the assumption that behind them lies a hidden and disreputable agenda. Last summer, when the British arrested two dozen people alleged to have been plotting to blow up airplanes crossing the Atlantic, a BBC presenter centered a discussion on the theory that these arrests had taken place because Tony Blair, embarrassed by opposition to Britain's role in the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, wanted to distract the public while at the same time associating Muslims with terrorism.
 The British are among our closest and most reliable allies, and it is strange that their government pays for these broadcasts, many of which are produced in Cairo rather than in London. If the BBC models its Arabic television service on its Arabic radio service, yet another anti-Western, antidemocratic channel will find its place on the Arab screen.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Inflation Surged Last Month

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS; AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Inflation at the wholesale level surged in February, pushed higher by a big jump in energy prices and the largest increase in food costs in more than three years.
 Wholesale prices rose by 1.3 percent last month, the biggest increase since last November, the Labor Department reported Thursday. And even more worrisome, prices outside of the volatile food and energy sectors also showed a bigger-than expected increase of 0.4 percent last month. Toy prices rose at the fastest rate in more than two decades. 
Separately, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits dropped by 12,000 to 318,000 last week. It was the second consecutive weekly decline and a welcome development after big increases earlier in the year had raised concerns about the health of the labor market.
 Financial markets have been roiled in recent days by worries that growing troubles with lenders who specialized in subprime mortgages -- loans offered to people with weak credit or low incomes --could drag down the overall economy.
 Investors were hoping that if the economic drag became bad enough, the Federal Reserve would start cutting interest rates to give the economy a boost. However, if the higher wholesale prices show up in rising retail prices paid by consumers, the Fed would be reluctant to cut interest rates for fear of fanning inflation.
 The 1.3 percent jump in wholesale prices was more than double the 0.5 percent rise that analysts had been expecting.
 It was driven by a 3.5 percent jump in energy costs, which followed a 4.6 percent drop in January. The price of gasoline was up 5.3 percent in February and more pain at the pump is expected. The Lundberg Survey said that the nationwide average for gasoline has risen by 20 cents per gallon in just the past two weeks, hitting $2.55 per gallon in the latest survey.
 The government's Producer Price Index, which measures price pressures before they reach the consumer, showed that food costs shot up 1.9 percent in February, the biggest one-month gain since October 2003. The increases reflected freezes in winter growing areas, which pushed up the price of fruits and vegetables.
 Core wholesale prices, which exclude food and energy, were up 0.4 percent, the biggest increase since November and double what Wall Street had been expecting.
 In this area, the cost of toys and games rose by 2.3 percent, the biggest increase since February 1983.
 The cost of light trucks, the category that includes sport utility vehicles, rose by 1.7 percent, the biggest gain since November, but the price of new passenger cars fell by 1.2 percent.
 The Federal Reserve meets next Tuesday and Wednesday to consider its interest rate policies. The expectation is that the central bank will leave interest rates unchanged, a stance it has taken since it last boosted rates in June of last year, capping a two-year drive to push rates higher as a way of slowing the economy and combating rising inflation pressures.

HEADLINE: Google Is Reviving Hopes For Ex-Furniture Makers

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: LENOIR, N.C. 

 BODY:
Almost 40 years ago, when Irene Marsh was a young woman, she took a few months of computer science courses. But when Ms. Marsh realized that would not help her find a job in this Appalachian furniture region, she dropped out and went to work in a factory making tabletops. 
 Then, like thousands of other furniture makers here in the last five years, she lost her job to workers overseas, after 37 years at one company. But Ms. Marsh, who recently sat with a mouse and keyboard in a basic-skills classroom at Caldwell Community College a few miles south of here, may yet have her chance at a computer job.
Last month, the Internet search giant Google announced that it would take advantage of the area's underused electric power grid, cheap land and robust water supply to build a ''server farm'' -- a building full of computers that will become part of the company's worldwide network. 
 Google says it hopes laid-off furniture workers, most of whom never graduated from high school, will be among the 250 employees at two facilities on the 215-acre site, much of which was once a lumberyard.
 Ms. Marsh, 58, intends to apply. ''Of course, you know, it's come a long way,'' she said cheerfully. ''Back then you used to have punch cards and all that. They needed a whole room for one big gigantic computer.''
 That Google chose Lenoir, a town that still uses some 18th-century techniques to make its signature products, may seem odd: Server farms require relatively little human labor, and they do not produce anything, not even baby computers.
 But the choice of Lenoir, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, bodes well for other struggling manufacturing economies in the South, as Google is already considering two sites in South Carolina for similar facilities. Google will not reveal how many server farms it has or intends to build, but they are important components in its race to stay ahead of competitors like Microsoft and Yahoo. 
 Since the deal in Lenoir (pronounced leh-NORE) was announced in February, city and county officials have found themselves on the defensive, criticized for the secrecy of the negotiations and the package of incentives, potentially worth $260 million, that Google will receive. 
 At Google's request, the state legislature passed a law exempting some high-tech businesses from paying sales tax on electricity -- a tax the company says it would not pay in many other states. And as long as the server farm is operational, the city and county will forgive 100 percent of the company's personal property taxes and 80 percent of its real estate taxes for up to 30 years.
 The deal's critics point out that although Google said it would invest $600 million and create 250 jobs at an average salary of $48,000, it made no minimum guarantees, often considered an important part of shielding economic development deals from accusations that they are corporate giveaways. The incentive package is one of the largest ever in the state, and when it is broken down per job, it is as much as $1.24 million each.
 ''I agree that jobs are what we need,'' said T. J. Rohr, the only city councilman to vote against the incentives (on principle, he said; he is a Libertarian). ''But what's the limit that you're willing to pay for a job?''
 Local officials argue that the company will pay hundreds of thousands in franchise fees, sales taxes and payroll taxes and that it has filled local hotels with construction workers, bought tons of stone and concrete and hired security guards. Since the deal was announced, a former Winn-Dixie store, on the market for more than a year, has sold, and the town mall is under contract, officials said. 
 ''Here's what I've asked people, too: What's the disadvantage?'' said David Barlow, the mayor. ''What if they weren't coming? Then we'd have 100 percent of nothing.''
 Most of the criticism has come not from locals but from the state's two biggest newspapers, The Charlotte Observer and The News & Observer of Raleigh, which have, among other things, questioned the secrecy employed in negotiating the deal. 
 At times, things have gotten personal. ''God bless them if they can learn how to run a server farm,'' a Charlotte Observer columnist wrote of Lenoir's work force. ''A lot of folks in Charlotte and Atlanta and D.C. already know how.''
 Tim Sanders, a county commissioner during the bulk of the negotiations, said officials simply researched competing sites and tried to make a better offer. He said Google had already paid $4 million to the city and county to offset some infrastructure costs, while the local governments have lost nothing.
 ''We're being criticized like we're a bunch of country hicks out here and we can't count,'' Mr. Sanders said.
 Mr. Barlow and Mr. Sanders considered the deal so important that they went door to door to ask some 35 homeowners to sell their land to amass a tract of the size Google wanted to buy. ''I dreaded living here if Google did not choose that site,'' Mr. Barlow said.
 Still, local residents have wondered how many of them will be qualified for the jobs Google has to offer. (The company says contractors will employ landscapers, janitors and security workers in addition to the 250 jobs.)
 Kyle Kiziak, 22, who works for a welding supply company, said his stepfather was recently laid off from his job as a truck driver. ''He sits there and thinks, 'Will they hire someone like me?' '' Mr. Kiziak said.
 Lloyd Taylor, Google's director of global operations, said there was a false assumption that the data center would have ''a team of rocket scientists holed up in a room.'' Many of the company's computers, he said, can self-diagnose problems and be repaired by trained workers. Google is already helping the community college develop a technology training program. And, he said, the company believes that furniture makers have ''a great work ethic.''
 The need for jobs, economic diversification and good news is dire. Lenoir's furniture industry has been decimated by overseas competition, and the transformation has been swift. The unemployment rate went from one of the state's lowest, 2.4 percent, in 2000, to 6.9 percent last year, after peaking at 9.8 percent in 2003. Some 5,000 furniture jobs have been lost. Many workers in their 40s and 50s, who raised families and paid mortgages on factory salaries, have had to go back to school. 
 G. Alex Bernhardt Sr., chairman and chief executive of the Bernhardt Furniture Company, said the industry had collapsed so quickly because a depression after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks coincided with a substantial increase in China's capacity to handle furniture manufacturing jobs, leading to a series of difficult announcements to Lenoir's workers.
 ''I usually say to them, 'I shop at Wal-Mart, I think most of you shop at Wal-Mart -- we can't have it both ways,' '' Mr. Bernhardt said during an interview in his office.
 Even though his company is a major taxpayer that does not get the same breaks promised to Google, Mr. Bernhardt said, he is enthusiastic about the center.
 ''They're bringing something new and fresh to the community that we need,'' he said. ''People who have to pay for those incentives, like Bernhardt, are not complaining about it.''
 Then Mr. Bernhardt began to muse about the county's transition from agrarian to industrial and now, he hopes, to a knowledge-based economy. ''My grandfather started the first furniture factory in Lenoir,'' he said.
 ''I wonder how long that took them,'' he said. ''It certainly didn't take only five years.''

HEADLINE: Iraqi Progress Misses Targets In Bush's Plan

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and DAVID E. SANGER; Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting from Baghdad, and Thom Shanker from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, which six months ago issued a series of political goals for the Iraqi government to meet by this month, is now tacitly acknowledging that the goals will take significantly longer to achieve. 
 In interviews this week, administration officials said that the military buildup intended to stabilize Baghdad and create the conditions for achieving the objectives would not be fully in place until June and that all of the objectives would not be fulfilled until the year's end.
A ''notional political timeline'' that the administration provided to Congress in January in an attachment to a letter from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, had called for most of the objectives to be met by this month.
 Four of the significant objectives are final approval of an oil law regulating distribution of oil revenues and foreign investment in the oil industry; reversal of the de-Baathification laws that are widely blamed for alienating Sunnis by driving them out of government ministries; the holding of local elections; and reform of Iraq's Constitution. 
 A Pentagon assessment of progress in Iraq through the end of last year, submitted to Congress on Wednesday, notes that Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki ''has promised to reform his government, beginning with his cabinet and the ministries,'' but that none of those steps had yet happened. It cited the ''passage of a framework'' last month for sharing oil revenues among Iraq's ethnic groups as a modest sign of progress, but notes that the last two months of 2006, before Mr. Bush announced his new strategy, ''saw little progress on the reconciliation front.''
 The report also described some of what is happening in Iraq as a ''civil war'' and described this past October through December as the most violent three-month period since 2003. 
 In interviews, officials said they expected most political progress to be months away. The slower pace of progress puts the administration in a difficult position, at a time of growing Congressional criticism of the new strategy, which starts with an increase of more than 20,000 American troops. 
 The slowness of political progress, officials say, could indicate the need to extend the time the new troops remain on the ground in Baghdad and its suburbs. Congressional Democrats are seeking passage of legislation that would impose a 2008 deadline for withdrawal of American troops, and they are calling for evidence that political benchmarks are being met. 
 Mr. Bush has told Congressional leaders that such American demands are part of ''a culture of seeking instant results,'' officials who have met with him said. 
 Still, a House bill under consideration this week lists benchmarks for Iraqi political progress and would require Mr. Bush to certify by July 1 that progress was being made. The bill would basically give Mr. Bush and the Iraqi government a deadline of Oct. 1 to meet those benchmarks. 
 Administration officials have never rescinded the ''notional timeline,'' though the Iraqi government had already missed most of the deadlines by the time Ms. Rice gave it to Congress in January. That document listed political achievements that Washington expected would be fulfilled between September 2006 and March 2007; with the exception of the oil law, which awaits final passage, most have not been achieved. American and Iraqi officials had agreed on the notional timeline back in October. 
 In interviews, Bush administration officials said that the House proposal was too rigid. ''The arbitrary setting of deadlines is counterproductive,'' a senior administration official said Wednesday. ''We need to see that they are progressing,'' the official said, but added that ''we don't think rigid deadlines are appropriate.''
 The Bush administration officials would agree to speak about the so-called benchmarks only on condition of anonymity, because of the politically delicate debate about whether the United States should be imposing deadlines on the Iraqi government. Indeed, even using the words ''deadlines'' or ''timetables'' has become politically treacherous. 
 Part of the problem is that some administration officials are wary of the response from Iraq's governing Shiites if the Americans push too hard, especially on rehabilitating past members of the Baath Party. That wariness is particularly acute because the administration is pushing Iraqi Shiites to bring more Sunnis into the government, as part of the political reconciliation process, at the same time that they are cracking down on Shiite militias.
 But in Baghdad, American officials seem increasingly willing to tolerate some of those Shiite militias as long as they patrol their own neighborhoods. Administration officials said they had eased up on parts of the timetable for re-integrating former Baathists, for fear of a Shiite backlash. Immediately after the American invasion four years ago, the United States pursued the opposite course by purging Baathists from positions of power. As part of the recent reversal, administration officials had hoped that Prime Minister Maliki would quickly agree to make room for more former Baathists in the military and elsewhere in government. 
 ''We're holding the Iraqis to their commitments on de-Baathification reform, and they're making progress,'' another senior administration official said. ''But we recognize that pushing some issues too hard or too fast or with rigid timelines can carry unintended consequences -- such as intensifying the very sectarianism we all want to dampen.'' 
 One Western diplomat in Baghdad said: ''We'd like to see Iraq develop a real moderate center. It may not be realistic on this short a timetable.'' 
 Philip D. Zelikow, until December the counselor at the State Department, said part of the delay stemmed from ''a recognition that things were worse than people realized.''
 ''Significant parts of the new strategy need to be developed from scratch,'' he said.
 There has been some progress on the political timetable. On Feb. 26, the Iraqi cabinet approved a draft of the oil law. The law approved by the cabinet allows the central government to distribute oil revenues to the provinces or regions based on population, which could lessen the economic concerns of the Sunni Arabs, who fear being cut out of Iraq's vast potential oil wealth by the dominant Shiites and Kurds. But Parliament has yet to approve the law; administration officials said they hoped to see approval in the next few weeks.
 The de-Baathification reversal will take much longer, administration officials say. There are four competing proposals on reversing de-Baathification from various political groups, including one from an Iraqi commission that includes President Jalal Talabani, which American officials say is the most promising. But Mr. Talabani has been ill, which has slowed down progress on the reversal of de-Baathification. 
 On local elections, the official said that ''Iraqis are working toward the end of the year, and I think that's a very reasonable goal.'' As for constitutional reform, administration officials say they do not have a timetable for its completion.

HEADLINE: Bush Leaves Mexico With Optimism, but No Agreements

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting.

DATELINE: MERIDA, Mexico, March 14 

 BODY:
President Bush left Mexico on Wednesday without reaching concrete agreements with the new Mexican president on a host of issues, from greater cooperation on attacking drug traffic to extending protections for Mexican farmers who grow corn and beans.
 But as he sought to mend ties with Mexico, Mr. Bush vowed to step up his efforts to persuade Congress to approve a bigger guest worker program for Mexican migrants and to provide a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants living in the United States illegally, most of them from Mexico and Central America.
Mr. Bush said that the mood in Congress had changed and that he was optimistic that he could persuade moderate Senate Republicans to join Democrats to overhaul immigration laws. He said the proposed changes would create a border where trade would flow freely but criminals and terrorists would face stiff obstacles. 
 ''A good migration law will help both economies and will help the security of both countries,'' Mr. Bush said at a news conference here with President Felipe Calderon. ''If people can come into our country, for example, on a temporary basis to work, doing jobs Americans aren't doing, they won't have to sneak across the border.''
 The meetings with Mr. Calderon were on the last stop on Mr. Bush's weeklong tour of Latin America. At every stop, the American president tried to highlight the positive things the United States had done in the region, promoting democracy and free trade and providing $1.6 billion in foreign aid. 
 Mr. Bush's tour was widely seen in Latin America as an attempt to counter the growing influence of Hugo Chavez, the leftist populist president of Venezuela. Mr. Chavez has been undermining United States influence in the region, using his country's vast oil wealth to build an anti-Washington coalition of left-leaning heads of state. 
 Mr. Calderon is a conservative free trade advocate, but he made it clear at the news conference that he would remain neutral in the ideological battle. He said he would seek to re-establish full diplomatic ties with Venezuela, which were downgraded by his predecessor, Vicente Fox, a staunch ally of the United States. 
 ''We are respectful of the heads of state of other countries, such as Venezuela, and certainly the United States,'' Mr. Calderon said.
 On trade, the two leaders did not resolve the thorny issue of protections for small farmers here that are to expire next year. Mr. Bush said it would be a mistake to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, as many leftists here want. 
 Nor did the presidents make much real progress in coordinating the fight against drug dealers, though Mr. Bush did praise Mr. Calderon's tough stance against traffickers and pledged to do more to reduce the demand for drugs in the United States.
 But the main focus of the talks appeared to be the perennial problem of illegal immigration -- more than 400,000 Mexicans cross the border without papers each year. 
 Mr. Calderon has sharply criticized the United States for plans to build a 700-mile wall along the border. He maintains that policies aimed at bringing more investment to Mexico would be a better strategy to slow illegal immigration.
 For his part, Mr. Bush, dogged by a scandal over the firings of federal prosecutors, seemed to embrace a chance to talk about immigration. He used the news briefing to send separate messages to his American and Mexican audiences. 
 He said his efforts to change immigration laws had been thwarted by the widespread perception in the United States that the current laws were not being enforced. That perception has changed, he maintained, as Congress and his administration have taken measures to deport more illegal immigrants and to fortify the border, posting 6,000 members of the National Guard as sentinels. 
 He called on his fellow Republicans opposed to his guest worker plan to get behind it now that he has addressed their concerns about border security. He said he had dispatched his homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, and his commerce secretary, Carlos Gutierrez, to negotiate with Republicans, and suggested that the talks were focused on what to do about illegal immigrants already in the country. 
 ''There's got to be a middle ground, a reasonable way to deal with the 12 million people or so that have been in our country for a period of time,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And that's where a lot of the discussions are taking place. And I think we can find a rational way forward, somewhere in between automatic citizenship and kicking people out of the country.''
 Mr. Bush also had a message for his Mexican audience, urging patience as the American legislative process plays out. ''I don't know about Mexico, Mr. President,'' Mr. Bush said with a wry smile, ''but sometimes legislators, you know, debate issues for a while before a solution can be achieved.'' 
 The differences of perspective on either side of the border were evident at the news conference, which was broadcast live on national radio here. A Mexican reporter asked Mr. Bush why people should believe that he could deliver a temporary-worker program after having failed to do so for six years. An American reporter asked Mr. Calderon if his relatives working in America were there legally, a question for which Mr. Calderon had a poignant answer. 
 ''Yes, I do have family in the United States, and what I can tell you is that these are people who work and respect that country,'' he said, his voice going misty. ''They pay their taxes to the government. These are people who work in the field, they work with -- in the fields with vegetables. They probably handle what you eat, the lettuce, et cetera.''
 ''I am from Michoacan,'' he went on, ''and in Michoacan we have four million people. Two million of these Michoacan natives are in the States. We want them to come back. We want them to find jobs here in Mexico. We miss them. These are our best people. These are bold people. They're young. They're strong. They're talented.''

HEADLINE: The Danger Zone

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The national unemployment rate came in at 4.5 percent last week and was generally characterized as pretty good. But whatever universe those numbers came from, it was not the universe that black men live in.
 Black American males inhabit a universe in which joblessness is frequently the norm, where the idea of getting up each morning and going off to work can seem stranger to a lot of men than the dream of hitting the lottery, where the dignity that comes from supporting oneself and one's family has too often been replaced by a numbing sense of hopelessness.
 What I'm talking about is extreme joblessness -- joblessness that is coursing through communities and being passed from one generation to another, like a deadly virus. 
 Forget, for a moment, the official unemployment numbers. They understate the problem of joblessness for all groups. Far more telling is the actual percentage of people in a given segment of the working-age population that is jobless.
 Black men who graduate from a four-year college do reasonably well in terms of employment, compared with other ethnic groups. But most black men do not go to college. In big cities, more than half do not even finish high school.
 Their employment histories are gruesome. Over the past few years, the percentage of black male high school graduates in their 20s who were jobless (including those who abandoned all efforts to find a job) has ranged from well over a third to roughly 50 percent. Those are the kinds of statistics you get during a depression.
 For dropouts, the rates of joblessness are staggering. For black males who left high school without a diploma, the real jobless rate at various times over the past few years has ranged from 59 percent to a breathtaking 72 percent.
 ''Seventy-two percent jobless!'' said Senator Charles Schumer, chairman of Congress's Joint Economic Committee, which held a hearing last week on joblessness among black men. ''This compares to 29 percent of white and 19 percent of Hispanic dropouts.''
 Senator Schumer described the problem of black male unemployment as ''profound, persistent and perplexing.''
 Jobless rates at such sky-high levels don't just destroy lives, they destroy entire communities. They breed all manner of antisocial behavior, including violent crime. One of the main reasons there are so few black marriages is that there are so many black men who are financially incapable of supporting a family.
 ''These numbers should generate a sense of national alarm,'' said Senator Schumer.
 They haven't. However much this epidemic of joblessness may hurt, very little is being done about it. According to the Labor Department, only 97,000 new jobs were created in February. That's not even enough to accommodate new entrants to the work force.
 And then there's the question of who's getting the new jobs. According to statistics compiled by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston, the only groups that have experienced a growth in jobs since the last recession are older workers and immigrants.
 People can howl all they want about how well the economy is doing. The simple truth is that millions of ordinary American workers are in an employment bind. Steady jobs with good benefits are going the way of Ozzie and Harriet. Young workers, especially, are hurting, which diminishes the prospects for the American family. And blacks, particularly black males, are in a deep danger zone.
 Instead of addressing this issue constructively, government officials have responded by eviscerating programs that were designed to move young people from disadvantaged backgrounds into the labor market. 
 Robert Carmona, president of Strive, an organization that helps build job skills, told Senator Schumer's committee, ''What we've seen over the last several years is a deliberate disinvestment in programs that do work.''
 What's needed are massive programs of job training and job creation, and a sustained national effort to bolster the education backgrounds of disadvantaged youngsters. So far there has been no political will to do any of that.
 You get lip service. But when you walk into the neighborhoods and talk to the young people, you find that very little, if anything, is being done. Which is why the real-world employment environment has become so horrendous for so many.

HEADLINE: Loan Unit Drags Down H&R Block

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL; Jenny Anderson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Just a few years ago, the tax-preparation giant H&R Block was making as much money from offering home loans to individuals with risky credit as it was preparing tax returns for millions of Americans.
 These days, however, while its tax business is showing signs of improvement, H&R Block cannot get rid of its subprime mortgage group, Option One, fast enough.
H&R Block disclosed yesterday that its loss widened to $60.3 million in the third quarter as a result of continued problems at Option One. The growing losses raised speculation on Wall Street whether executives would achieve their goal of selling the unit for $1.3 billion this month. 
 ''I think it's unlikely they'll get that, having witnessed all of the problems the subprime space has experienced in recent weeks,'' said Kelly Flynn, an analyst with UBS. 
 H&R Block is not alone in struggling with mounting losses in the subprime sector, where growing delinquencies and defaults by borrowers are weighing heavily on companies that acquired subprime lenders and reaped robust profits during the boom years in the industry. 
 On Tuesday, General Motors said that it would inject $1 billion into GMAC because of losses in its mortgage division, Residential Capital. Last week, General Electric, which bought the subprime lender WMC Mortgage in 2004, announced large layoffs in the division along with a significant tightening of lending standards.
 But fears that the problems in subprime could spill over into other real estate and financial markets were tempered somewhat yesterday as Lehman Brothers, a major player in mortgages and their securitization, reported strong first-quarter results. And stocks, which had swooned on Tuesday after a report showed further weakness in housing, recovered in afternoon trading yesterday. 
 After sell-offs on Asian and European markets, American markets swung back and forth, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling below 12,000 at midday for the first time since early November. Stocks ended the day higher. The Dow closed up 57.44 points, or 0.48 percent, to 12,133.40, and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index closed up 9.22 points, or 0.67 percent, at 1,387.17. 
 Shares of Countrywide Financial and other lenders that have slumped had gains yesterday. Still, shares of Lehman Brothers ended down 28 cents, at $71.72. 
 Lehman, which owns five mortgage lenders (a mix of prime and subprime) and has had soaring fixed-income revenue in tandem with the housing boom over the years, reported record earnings of $1.2 billion for the first quarter, a 5.6 percent rise from a year earlier.
 Lehman's chief financial officer, Christopher O'Meara, said the bank's subprime business represented about 3 percent of overall revenue. The business has taken a hit with the meltdown of the market. ''There's near-term trepidation as people digest what is happening,'' Mr. O'Meara said. ''We think this is temporary.''
 He noted that securitization volumes had fallen. The bank underwrote $22 billion in the first quarter, compared with $40 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006 and $34 billion for the first quarter of 2006. Origination is ''essentially flat'' over the same quarter a year ago, he said. Subprime lenders have had more trouble weathering the storm. New Century, one of the country's largest subprime lenders, which stopped making loans last week after Wall Street banks cut off its access to funds, said yesterday that regulators in four states accused the company of violating laws after failing to finance mortgages it promised to borrowers.
 H&R Block appears to be in better straits because its tax business allows it to offset losses.
 H&R Block entered the subprime mortgage industry in 1997, when it acquired Option One from Fleet Financial. (Option One was founded a few years earlier as Plaza Home Mortgage by a handful of executives who departed to start their own company, New Century.) 
 Based in Orange County in California, home to many of the nation's biggest subprime lenders, Option One operated as a fairly separate entity from H&R Block's core tax-preparation business, analysts said. That diversification helped H&R Block as the boom in subprime allowed Option One to buoy profits at a time when the company's market share in the tax preparation business came under attack by competitors like Jackson Hewitt.
 In fiscal year 2004, for instance, Option One accounted for $688.5 million of H&R's operating income compared with $638.5 million for its tax business that year.
 ''Option One pretty much drove H&R's shares higher between 2002 and about 2005,'' said Scott Schneeberger, an analyst with CIBC World Markets. ''It really helped the company out.''
 Last year, however, the subprime unit began producing pain for the parent as losses mounted amid rising interest rates and increased levels of defaults. That prompted the company to say it was exploring a sale of Option One in November. At that time, several Wall Street firms including Lehman and Merrill Lynch were snapping up subprime lenders.
 A spokesman for the company yesterday declined to comment on expectations for a sale of the unit. But the chief executive, Mark Ernst, told Bloomberg News yesterday that he still expected to sell Option One for at least $1.3 billion, the unit's net asset value.

HEADLINE: French Lick Returns to Its Sin City Roots

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
WE glided on ancient steel rails alongside a clear, slow-moving river, past golden fields and red barns, a canopy of green overhead. The view from the Pullman car's windows looked very much like it did 90 years ago, when Parke Flick used to ride the train with his father, who was on his way to work at the West Baden Springs Resort near French Lick, Ind.
 ''People called this the Monte Carlo of America back then,'' said Mr. Flick, now 94, watching as a little diesel engine pulled five vintage passenger cars into the town's depot. It stopped just short of the resort, with its mammoth red dome flanked by three white towers. ''It was magnificent.''
The train was how visitors usually arrived in the Roaring Twenties -- a dozen or more trainloads a day -- when French Lick was one of America's most famous, and infamous, party towns. Back then French Lick and the surrounding Springs Valley had 30 hotels and 15 clubs. The town, which got its name from the French traders who founded it and the salty mineral deposits that attracted wildlife, was a lawless hangout for a generation of politicians, entertainers, sports idols and gangsters. 
 ''When I went into the Army and told people I was from French Lick, they all knew it, mostly for two things: Pluto Water and gambling,'' Mr. Flick said. The mineral water from Pluto Springs may no longer be bottled, but the gambling, after more than a half-century's absence, is making a comeback.
 A $382 million makeover of the area's two famed Beaux-Arts hotels has just been completed. The hotels, the French Lick Springs Resort and the West Baden Springs Resort, both of which originally opened a few months apart in 1901 and '02, are national historic landmarks. West Baden's six-story atrium had the world's largest free-span dome until the Astrodome opened in 1965. 
 The restoration of West Baden Springs is the last major piece of a plan to return tiny French Lick, also known as the hometown of the basketball star Larry Bird, to its long-lost status as one of the Midwest's biggest resort destinations. West Baden's 246 guest rooms and suites are expected to open in May, when the hotel will welcome its first paying guests since the Depression.
 The neighboring French Lick Springs Resort, rechristened the French Lick Resort Casino, has been open since last fall. It had been closed for two years for a painstakingly thorough refurbishing of its 443 rooms, lobby and other public areas. 
 And since November at the French Lick resort, gamblers have been able to try their luck at the town's first licensed casino, one every bit as grand as the big illicit casinos of French Lick's heyday. The resort's 84,000-square-foot casino features 1,200 slot machines and dozens of table games like blackjack, roulette, craps and poker. 
 The restorations evoke memories of French Lick's long-lost past.
 ''My father kept up the grounds around the West Baden resort -- they were like the gardens of Versailles,'' Mr. Flick remembered. ''I worked my way into a front office job, and ended up as the auditor. Dad and I were probably the last two people out before they closed years ago. I never thought it would open again. No sir.
 ''I thought they'd tear it down, if it didn't fall down first.''
 But preservationists saved the West Baden resort, which was near collapse 15 years ago. Guided tours have been available in recent years, but now the whole resort has been restored to its former glory. 
 At the French Lick resort, ''they went first class with everything: linens, furniture, fixtures and all,'' said Judi Kimmel, chairwoman of the committee planning the celebration of the town's 150th anniversary, which takes place this year. ''The lobby of the hotel is just absolutely out of this world. It is one of the most ornate things you will ever see. It seems like it's all gold.''
 In fact, much of it is. According to Eric Whitson, a vice president of the resort, the restoration used 6,000 square feet of gold leaf, about a million dollars' worth.
 ''The place is a diamond,'' said Larry Vormbrock, a retiree from Taylorsville, Ky., who has already visited the new casino several times. ''It's a little bit still in the rough, but when West Baden opens up, it will be a dream place to visit -- one of those must-see places.''
 THE French Lick Resort Casino also features eight new restaurants, designer shops, a bowling alley, a video game arcade and a swimming pool complete with four life-size dolphin statues spitting water. (The casino, oddly, is built in the shape of a riverboat and is surrounded by a moat, which somehow meets the letter of a 1993 state law allowing gambling on only riverboats.)
 Mr. Vormbrock was honored as the winner of the first dollar paid out by the casino, at its grand opening in November. 
 ''They really are to be complimented for hiring the friendliest staff I've ever seen,'' he said. ''I only live seven miles from the Caesars Indiana casino. But this is worth driving the extra 52 miles.''
 At its Prohibition Era peak, French Lick boasted 13 casinos, all of them illegal. One of them was even owned by Indiana's Democratic Party boss, Thomas Taggart, a former mayor of Indianapolis and eventually a United States senator. Another was owned by the impresario and circus owner Ed Ballard, who was the state's Republican Party chairman. ''That's how the casinos managed to stay open,'' Mr. Flick said. ''They were protected on both sides of the aisle at the Capitol.''
 ''It used to be said the road to the White House ran through French Lick,'' said Ms. Kimmel. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman and Adlai E. Stevenson were among those who came courting the power brokers in the fabled smoke-filled rooms at the French Lick Springs Resort, prior to their presidential nominations. 
 Other famous guests from the town's glamour days included the Marx Brothers, Joe Louis, Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.
 ''My wife and I walked through there one Sunday afternoon after they opened up,'' Mr. Flick said, referring to the Boat in the Moat, as French Lickers call the new casino, ''and I said if old Tom Taggart could come back and see this, he wouldn't know what to think.''
 Taggart died in 1929, but then his son Tom Jr. took over. The Depression closed West Baden, but the other casinos in town operated until 1949. That year a new governor, Henry F. Schricker, who had won election as a reformer pledged to clean up French Lick, ordered a police raid on the town to shut down the gambling parlors. 
 The raid took place while French Lick was packed for Kentucky Derby weekend. Adlai Stevenson, then the governor of Illinois, was in town, as was Eddie Rickenbacker, the president of Eastern Airlines. 
 ''We've put a lid on French Lick, once and for all,'' Schricker said after the raid. ''The gamblers have been told to straighten up and clear out. Indiana will never see the likes of them again.''
 But this tiny town of around 2,000 proved tough to tame. Through the 1990s, many groups presented increasingly innovative ideas for legal casinos, including entities headed by Mr. Bird and Donald Trump. Finally in 2003 Bill Cook, an Indianan who owns a company that makes medical devices and whose net worth is estimated at $3.2 billion, his wife, Gayle, and the Lauth Property Group of Indianapolis, won approval for the Boat in the Moat proposal. 
 The Cooks are also restoring French Lick's status as a major golf destination. The historic Donald Ross-designed golf course a few miles west of town reopened for play last fall after an almost archaeological-caliber re-excavation and restoration.
 The Donald Ross Course againlooks much as it did in 1924, when it was known as the Hills Course and was the site of a United States Open won by Walter Hagen. A second 18-hole layout, designed by Pete Dye, is being built a mile north of the resort and is to open in spring 2008. An almost forgotten course designed by the legendary Tom Bendelow nearly a century ago -- adjacent to the old trolley tracks between the two resorts -- is also being revived and reconfigured for nine holes, along with indoor and outdoor practice facilities.
 That casino trolley is just a memory now, as are the rail lines that once delivered Pullman-loads of hedonists from Louisville, Ky., 55 miles east, and Indianapolis, about 100 miles north. But the French Lick, West Baden & Southern Railway still operates a short sightseeing run from the resort's historic depot, which also houses the Indiana Railway Museum. 
 Transportation is the next challenge this area must overcome. The local private airstrip is large enough for small jets, but the nearest commercial airport is in Louisville. A superhighway to Indianapolis is planned but so far unbuilt. Two-lane roads must suffice for now.
 The return of the big resorts could be a boon for French Lick and the surrounding Orange County, which has experienced hard times since the '49 raid. The county's days of having the state's highest unemployment rate and lowest median household income appear to be ending. ''We were slowly becoming a ghost town,'' said Jerry Denbo, a French Lick native and state assemblyman who supports legalized gambling. 
 Now, of the more than 1,000 resort employees who have been hired, well over half are from Orange County. 
 Colorful names adorn towns throughout this part of southern Indiana -- places like Beanblossom, Pumpkin Center, Santa Claus, Hindustan, Buddha and Gnaw Bone. But none has a history as colorful as French Lick's, or, perhaps, a future as bright. CHANGE OF FORTUNEAmish Buggies And Gambling
 THE two closest major airports to French Lick are in Louisville, Ky., about an hour away, and Indianapolis, about two hours distant. Greenwood Aviation (317-605-9144; www.greenwood-aviation.com) offers a charter service from Indianapolis for $99 round trip to French Lick's general aviation airstrip. 
 Rates for lodging at the 443-room French Lick Resort Casino (8670 West State Road 56; 812-936-9300; www.frenchlick.com) start at $139 a night for a king and climb to $1,200 a night for the luxurious Pool Suite; the smaller F. D. R., Governor's and Walter Hagen suites go for slightly less.
 The West Baden Springs Hotel has the same contact information, and uses the same address. Reservations are being accepted for June 1 and beyond, although the hotel's 246 rooms might be open a week or two earlier. Room rates start at $229, or $350 for suites. Tours ($10) are offered of the lobby, the formal gardens and the huge atrium. Big night out: the presidential-size Cook Suite, a multi-room mini-mansion that rents for $5,000 nightly.
 A quaint alternative is the Beechwood Country Inn (8315 West State Route 56; 812-936-9012; www.beechwoodin.com), the former mansion of the gambling and circus tycoon Ed Ballard, who once owned the West Baden Springs Hotel and its casino. The inn has a restaurant and just six rooms, ranging from $129 for the maid's quarters (better than it sounds) to $229 for the baronial Ballard Suite. Of special note: the Music Room, where Irving Berlin and Cole Porter each composed tunes. The inn's owners, Tami and Ray Thompson, may also regale you with tales of other famous visitors, including Howard Hughes, Joe Louis and a gangster or two.
 Would-be dudes and dudettes may prefer the Wilstem Guest Ranch (812-936-4484; www.wilstemguestranch.com), the Ballard family's former cattle spread, six miles east on Route 150. (Watch out for slow-moving Amish buggies.) The ranch's cabins have 12 units and the property is 1,100 acres, big enough for 30 miles of horse trails, a fishing pond and a convention-size barn.

HEADLINE: Small White Wonders and Other Delicacies

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
Sometimes all it takes to rivet the eye is a large assembly of small, tenderly made, exquisitely expressive objects. The latest proof is ''Incisive Images: Ivory and Boxwood Carvings, 1450-1800,'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, an intimate display of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weaponry and the occasional piece of furniture. Made of ivory or boxwood, all come from the museum's collections, and last Friday night they were stopping traffic even before the show was officially open. 
 That may be partly because the exhibition occupies a vitrine-lined gallery next to the Lehman Wing and on the main route to the museum's cafeteria. Passers-by on their way to dinner stopped to peer at the objects and their temporary photocopied labels. Altogether the show is a hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts, cross-cultural currents and drop-dead displays of artistic skill and ambition. 
With its lustrous whiteness, ivory casts a spell from afar, even before you quite know what you're looking at. Sometimes called white gold, the best ivory came from African elephants. That harvesting is now illegal, but attachment to the material runs deep. It has been prized since cave dwellers took up carving. Smooth and fine-grained, it is something like the world's first plastic, only better. 
 If ivory's desirability knows no cultural boundaries, its availability is another story. As the plentiful small carvings in the galleries of medieval and Byzantine art near this exhibition attest, ivory, brought overland by Arab traders, was widely available in Europe until the decline of the Mamluk empire. In its subsequent scarcity, boxwood, similarly fine-grained, became the next best thing. Then, in the late 1400s, Portugal and Spain established sea routes to sub-Saharan Africa, and ivory was back, just in time for the High Renaissance and especially the Baroque, when secular rulers needing status symbols were plentiful. 
 Not surprisingly, the Met's show conveys the aura of privilege and the luxury of court life, private chapels and wonder cabinets. German-speaking princes in particular liked to designate official ivory carvers, most of whom were equally adept with boxwood. 
 One of these was the German artist Adam Lenckhart (1610-61), who served Prince Karl Eusebius of Liechtenstein in Vienna. While working in Italy in the early 1630s he carved two small reliefs -- a Lamentation and an Assumption of the Virgin -- that are exemplary for their confident realism, spatial recession and telling details that range from rich textiles to physical gestures. In the Lamentation, for example, John the Baptist grasps the robe of the bereft Virgin, collapsing over Jesus' body in a way that captures the physical and emotional weight of grief. 
 Another more emphatically Baroque ivory relief shows Joseph with Potiphar's wife, who is trying to seduce him. Joseph's hair and garments, blowing sideways, suggest the speed with which he retreats from the naked woman, but the real actors in the scene are the roiled bed linens and especially the canopy's swirling drapes, which reach toward Joseph like surrogate arms. 
 Several of the show's oldest objects reflect the cross-fertilization of cultures endemic to global trade. A small but monumentally scaled Sapi-Portuguese saltcellar from Sierra Leone dating from the 15th or 16th century consists of a vessel topped by a head of Jesus and a base with typically geometric Sapi guardians. Even more remarkable is a saltcellar base on which African figures wear Western dress, and the twisted, rippling surface of a hemisphere suggests European silverwork, even though four of the ripples are snakes hissing at small dogs crouched below. The label notes that African saltcellars were coveted throughout Europe and that Albrecht Durer owned two as early as 1521. 
 A delightful Indo-Portuguese sculpture dating from the 17th or 18th century depicts Christ as the Good Shepherd, dozing upright atop a slightly stupalike mountain dotted with little sheep whose fleece -- incised with tiny grids -- makes them look like armadillos. Nearby, a Hispano-Philippine Madonna has the sinuous S-curve grace of a Tang sculpture of a Chinese courtesan. And in an adjacent vitrine, a minute boxwood triptych pendant, made by indigenous artists in 16th-century Mexico under the tutelage of Flemish missionaries, depicts scenes of the Passion. It combines intricate microcarving with the equally intricate pre-Columbian technique of feather mosaic.
 Microcarving seems to have been something of a specialty among German, Dutch and Flemish artists, and the exhibition includes several dazzling examples. A boxwood rosary bead about the size of a squash ball is flat-out stunning: the interiors of its halves teem with busy crowd scenes whose figures are just millimeters tall. One half depicts Jesus before Pilate; the other is a panoramic view of Calvary, with the three crosses rising majestically above a delicately indicated scrum of mourners, horses and soldiers. It was made in the southern Netherlands in the early 1500s, but its grandeur may remind you of Rembrandt's great engraving ''The Three Crosses,'' from the 1650s. 
 Nearby in a tiny Flemish foldout book, the scenes of the Passion are depicted in carved openwork ivory plaques the size of generous postage stamps. Economies of space dictated an Ascension in which only the hem of Christ's gown is visible at the top; he has risen out of the picture.
 In its own vitrine and on a considerably larger scale is a more macabre reminder of the next world: a refined German lindenwood sculpture of death as an archer mounted on a horse; both are emaciated, with their bones showing through their rotting flesh. 
 But the Christian ethic falters in certain parts of the show, including a rather salacious 17th-century German statue, in spindlewood, of Lot and his daughters, and a series of works on mythological themes. There are two wonderful depictions of Hercules: a tiny ivory bust, in which he wears his lion skin casually, like a hoodie, and an elaborate rendering of him battling one of his foes, possibly the river god Achelous. He strains heroically (what else?) while his lion skin, half-covering his face, seems to be doing a large part of the fighting. Meanwhile another sculptural feat almost escapes notice: Achelous' disguise, a bull, lies crumpled on the ground, like a wet bathing suit. 
 For less strenuous antics, the next vitrine contains a small relief of a busy bacchanal of 15 romping putti, including one with a tablecloth over his head -- a kind of prelampshade party act. And for a full-bodied lion, there's the rearing one being tamed by Cupid, bridle and all, in a Flemish statue made by Mattheus van Beveren in the late 17th century. 
 There is almost nothing that disappoints in this marvelous show, which has been organized by Johanna Hecht, associate curator in the museum's department of European sculpture and decorative arts. Once you drag yourself away from the wall vitrines, you'll find ivory-handled firearms to die for, a small forest of ivory-handled knives and daggers and ornate ivory spoons, and a paper-thin lidded cup in turned ivory. This miracle of lathe-handling and geometric calculation has a Pisa-like lean at once slinky and wobbly that can evoke the putti. When your eyes get tired, one final vitrine contains larger fare like a crisply incised ivory side chair and an ornately shaped but starkly unincised candelabrum with a similar wall sconce and small chandelier, all four made in India in the late 18th century. 
 Beyond that, if you time it right, lunch or dinner is one flightdown. ''Incisive Images: Ivory and Boxwood Carvings, 1450-1800'' is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org, through Nov. 25.

 CORRECTION:
A review on Friday of ''Incisive Images: Ivory and Boxwood Carvings, 1450-1800,'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, misidentified a figure on the Lamentation, a relief by Adam Lenckhart. It was St. John the Apostle, sometimes known as St. John the Beloved Disciple, grasping the robe of the Virgin -- not John the Baptist. The review also misstated the source of the items in the exhibition. Five of the nearly 100 pieces were borrowed from private collections; not all came from the Met's collection.

HEADLINE: Facing Off Against Asbestos, Tobacco and Now Home Insurers

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

DATELINE: PASCAGOULA, Miss. 

 BODY:
Richard F. Scruggs, one of the country's most successful trial lawyers, made his first fortune in a case that hit close to home. He sued asbestos makers on behalf of workers at the shipyard in his hometown, Pascagoula, who had developed lung diseases. He made his second fortune with lawsuits against the tobacco industry, coming up with a winning legal strategy in Mississippi that he then applied nationwide.
 But his latest legal battle -- trying to force insurers to pay more for damage from Hurricane Katrina -- literally hit home.
His white-washed house on Beach Boulevard, just 50 yards from the Gulf of Mexico, is gone. The house, with its columned entrance and sunny breakfast room, appeared in the movie ''The Insider,'' about a whistle-blower who helped Mr. Scruggs win a $248 billion settlement in the tobacco case. It was so badly mangled that it had to be bulldozed to the foundation slab. 
 The loss made him a partner in grief with tens of thousands of residents along the coast of Mississippi. Many turned to him in their battle for insurance money in a fight that has become a financial and public relations nightmare for the insurance industry.
 Mr. Scruggs, 60, slim, often folksy and smooth as molasses in court, is using techniques that he honed in his earlier legal fights. He is arguing now, as he did before to such good effect, that he is fighting for the little guy who cannot stand up alone to big anonymous companies. 
 ''These are not just legal wars,'' Mr. Scruggs said in a recent interview. ''They are public relations and political wars.''
 The insurance companies counter that Mr. Scruggs has portrayed them unfairly and misleadingly. 
 ''Mr. Scruggs has taken a tiny portion of the claims associated with Katrina and tried to paint the entire insurance industry with a brush of malfeasance,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, president and chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute. ''And that is an entirely incorrect characterization.'' 
 Joseph Annotti, a spokesman for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, whose members provide 40 percent of the home insurance in Mississippi and the rest of the country, calls Mr. Scruggs an opportunist. ''People are looking for someone to blame and someone to pay,'' Mr. Annotti said. ''He's playing on that anger and people's raw emotions. On our part, we underwrite policies that go through strict regulatory approval. Every word is approved by the state regulator.'' 
 The insurance dispute centers on two main kinds of damage in a hurricane: wind and flooding. People along the Mississippi coast say they thought their policies covered any type of hurricane damage. The insurers, with the backing of the courts, have insisted that flooding is not included. 
 But in some cases insurers have also refused to pay when a house was wrecked by both wind and flooding -- and there, a federal judge has ruled, they were wrong. Flood insurance is sold by the federal government. But fewer than 20 percent of the coastal residents in Mississippi bought it. 
 Insurers note that they have paid $41 billion for damage from Katrina, including $5.5 billion for homes in Mississippi. The insurers add that only 1 percent of their customers have taken them to court, but that amounts to more than 2,000 lawsuits in Mississippi and many more in New Orleans and elsewhere in Louisiana that are being dealt with separately. 
 For months after the hurricane hit on Aug. 29, 2005, the insurance dispute in Mississippi was stalled. But in mid-January a Biloxi couple won a $1 million verdict against State Farm, the largest home insurer in the nation and in Mississippi.
 Less than two weeks later, Mr. Scruggs completed negotiations on settlements with State Farm worth at least $130 million, setting the pattern, many insurance experts said, for resolving hundreds of other cases and potentially providing hundreds of millions of dollars for rebuilding along the coast. 
 Mr. Scruggs conceded he has used ''every trick in the book'' to gain advantage over the insurers. 
 ''This is very personal,'' he said. ''This is about my family, my friends, the people I grew up with. I wake up at 3:30 every morning thinking of ways to get at this thing.'' 
 In what some of his critics sniff at as unlawyerly decorum, he missed no opportunity to bash the insurers in newspaper and television interviews and press releases. He embraced two whistle-blowers who walked away from their jobs as claims adjusters, taking with them thousands of State Farm documents. Then he turned over the information to the attorney general of Mississippi, who began a criminal investigation. 
 In his talks with State Farm, Mr. Scruggs regularly dropped the names of two of his clients -- his brother-in-law, Senator Trent Lott, and his friend, Representative Gene Taylor, who both lost houses to Katrina and had their claims rejected by State Farm. 
 Both men have been leading efforts in Congress to eliminate the industry's exemption from antitrust laws and to strip the insurers of some tax benefits. Also, at their behest, federal investigators have been looking into some of the practices regarding claims payments that Mr. Scruggs has been challenging.
 [On Monday, Mr. Scruggs surprised State Farm by abruptly filing court papers to withdraw from the agreement he had engineered. But other lawyers said they thought Mr. Scruggs was merely maneuvering to force State Farm to agree to modifications requested by Federal Judge L. T. Senter Jr. to improve terms for policy holders before approving the deal.
 [State Farm said it had not been consulted by Mr. Scruggs on the move. But Phil Supple, a spokesman, said the company was ''still open to any reasonable and just proposal to put these issues behind us.''
 [In a separate case, a jury in Gulfport, Miss., on Thursday awarded a homeowner $66,234, and State Farm settled the policy holder's claim for punitive damage for an undisclosed amount.]
 Mr. Scruggs began his career often defending insurance companies at a prestigious law firm in Jackson after graduating from the University of Mississippi Law School in 1976. 
 Looking for more independence and more money, Mr. Scruggs said he persuaded his wife, Diane, to move back to Pascagoula, the hard-scrabble town where they both were raised. His first year on his own he tripled his income.
 ''I was not altruistic,'' he said. 
 Not long after, he began handling the asbestos cases of workers at the Ingalls shipyard. ''Over time, I became aware of how they were being treated by their employers,'' he said. ''Like another consumable in the manufacturing process. Like a welding rod.''
 Mr. Scruggs and several partners received $50 million for their work on the asbestos cases. He used the asbestos money to bankroll the litigation against big tobacco and has been using the tobacco money to take on other industries, like health care and now home insurance.
 Mr. Scruggs said his first objective in his latest legal battle was to help people get back on their feet. But he also wanted to tilt the balance of power in insurance more toward the customer. 
 In hopes of getting stricter regulation, he has quietly begun campaigning to replace George Dale as commissioner of insurance in Mississippi and he is pushing insurers to rewrite their policies in plain English.
 ''The policies are designed to be ambiguous,'' Mr. Scruggs said. ''They can say, 'This is as clear as the nose on your face,' or, 'It doesn't mean that at all.' All this litigation has got people talking and realizing that these insurance companies really aren't in it for them. They're in it for themselves.''
 Not so, the insurers say. ''There's no benefit in short-changing consumers,'' Mr. Annotti said. ''But you have to draw the line somewhere and say, 'Look, these were the terms of the policy.' ''
 Mr. Scruggs came to terms with State Farm in two phases. First, the insurer agreed to pay $80 million to 640 homeowners, many of whom had been originally denied any payment by the company. Then, State Farm agreed to reopen damage claims for up to 36,000 others. In that agreement, State Farm said it would pay at least $50 million. 
 Some lawyers, who are pursuing separate cases against the insurers and who oppose the larger settlement, have raised suspicions that Mr. Scruggs drove a harder bargain for his initial clients, the 640 homeowners, than for the others. And there have been complaints from rival lawyers about potential fees of more than $46 million for Mr. Scruggs and the pick-up team of two dozen lawyers in his Scruggs Katrina Group.
 Mr. Scruggs, who has earned more than he says he could spend in 10 life times, said he got the best deal he could for all his clients and that the earnings of his group would rise as payouts to homeowners increase. 
 He said he would never have signed off on a deal that slighted coast residents. ''It's important to me to be respected in your hometown,'' he said. ''Not to betray, or be perceived to betray, the people who got you where you are.''
 Mr. Scruggs said that his own insurer, USAA, had paid him several hundred thousand dollars but that his claim was still not fully resolved. He was one of the few homeowners along the coast who bought federal flood insurance, and he said he was paid the maximum $250,000 on the house and $80,000 for some of the furnishings. 
 As part of the settlements with State Farm, Jim Hood, the attorney general of Mississippi, agreed to end his criminal investigation of the company and drop it from a civil lawsuit that accuses most of the insurers in Mississippi of failing to live up to commitments in their policies. 
 State Farm further angered Mississippians by declaring that because of an uncertain legal climate in the state, it would stop providing new coverage on homes. 
 Mr. Scruggs said he was sure other companies would come in to pick up the slack. ''If this is the way State Farm is going to treat their trusted customers, then don't let the door hit them in the fanny,'' he said. 
 The insurance companies may not like Mr. Scruggs. But if he wanted to run for office in Mississippi, now might be a good time. Outside the Beau Rivage Casino in Biloxi one morning, Michael Foster, a security worker, overheard a reporter on a cellphone arranging to meet Mr. Scruggs. 
 ''He's good people,'' Mr. Foster said after the phone call ended. ''He's down to earth. If he tells you something, it's gospel.''
 Less than a year before the hurricane, Mr. Scruggs bought a house in Oxford, Miss., the home of the University of Mississippi. He had already shifted his main office there. Since then, Mr. Scruggs, a former Navy pilot, has commuted to the coast in a corporate jet that he often flies himself. In Pascagoula, he stays in a boxy mobile home parked on the waterfront slab where Senator Lott's home once stood. 
 He has sold his bare lot on Beach Boulevard, but he has not abandoned the coast. He is repairing storm damage to his late father-in-law's home, and plans to make that his Pascagoula home. It is about 100 yards farther back from the water than the home he lost to Katrina.

HEADLINE: OPEC Says It Will Not Increase Oil Production to Meet Rising Demand

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: VIENNA, March 15 

 BODY:
Ignoring concerns over slowing economic growth, slightly volatile stock markets and a softening housing market in the United States, OPEC ministers said on Thursday that they would keep oil production at current levels.
 Their decision came despite calls to pump more supplies into a market that is becoming increasingly tight.
Holding output steady could send oil prices higher this spring as demand for gasoline picks up. Retail gasoline prices in the United States have been rising since the beginning of the year and reached about $2.60 a gallon on average last week, nearly 40 cents more than in January. 
 ''Three dollars a gallon is just around the corner,'' said Jason Schenker, an economist at Wachovia. ''We've never seen retail gasoline prices rise so much so early in the year.''
 For consumers in developed countries, a solid rise in demand would probably mean another summer of high gasoline prices and stiff energy bills. Oil prices have settled around $60 a barrel in recent months and members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries seem satisfied with that level. Last year, the oil cartel, which pumps about a third of the world's crude oil, cut its production levels twice to keep prices from falling below $50 a barrel.
 ''The market is stable,'' Abdalla Salem el-Badri, OPEC's secretary general, told a news conference after a meeting here. ''The market is healthy. We do not need to touch it at this time.''
 In its final statement, OPEC said that global economic growth would remain ''relatively firm'' this year, although at a lower level than last year, and noted that higher interest rates had cooled the global economy.
 Still, it added, ''Overall oil market volatility is likely to continue.'' 
 ''We are watching developments on world stock markets to assess their possible impact on the global economy and, in particular, on energy demand,'' said Mohamed bin Dhaen al-Hamli, OPEC's president and the oil minister from the United Arab Emirates. 
 Following the OPEC meeting, crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed at $57.55, down 0.6 percent. 
 OPEC's 12 members are not expected to meet until September, but they could have an emergency session in June if prices slip out of control.
 ''OPEC is managing the market once again,'' said Yasser Elguindi, an energy analyst at Medley Global Advisors. ''The Saudis are going to focus on the fundamentals, and prices will do what they have to do, assuming there is no major economic breakdown, which is probably the biggest risk as far as they are concerned.''
 High oil prices have encouraged investments in new energy projects. OPEC countries have invested $100 billion in various oil projects, the group's president said at the news briefing. That would result in 38 million barrels a day of oil production capacity by 2010 for OPEC countries.
 But some members, like Iran and Iraq, are hard pressed to attract investors or increase production. Foreign companies are increasingly reluctant to invest in Iran's energy sector given the heightened pressure from the United States. 
 Iraq's government recently passed a hydrocarbon law to redevelop its crippled oil and gas sector. But energy executives do not expect much movement there until the violence in the country subsides.
 Still, Hussain al-Shahristani, the Iraqi oil minister, told reporters in Vienna that Iraq would offer a first round of bidding for oil projects in the second half of this year once the oil law, drawn up by the Council of Ministers, receives Parliament's approval. 
 International oil companies will be invited to bid for some existing fields as well as 65 new exploration blocks. It is still not clear what type of contracts would be offered, Mr. Shahristani said. He also suggested that some of the oil contracts signed under Saddam Hussein's regime would not be canceled following a review by the newly created Federal Council for Oil and Gas.
 Analysts say they expect non-OPEC supplies to grow by around a million barrels a day this year. Meanwhile, demand is expected to increase by 1.5 million barrels to 86 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency, a 1.8 percent jump from 2006.
 ''They are pulled in two different directions,'' said Vera de Ladoucette, an energy analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''One is a worry about a potential American and global recession and the consequences of that on demand. The other is overshooting as they continue to tighten supplies.
 ''When they are faced with this kind of alternative, they always err on the side of caution, and roll over the current production.''

HEADLINE: Sharp Rise in Producer Prices Shows Inflation Still Hangs Over Economy

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Prices rose broadly and sharply for businesses in February as an array of goods, from children's toys to tobacco, became more expensive.
 The government's gauge of inflation at the producer level, which measures the prices businesses charge one another, rose 1.3 percent last month, after falling 0.6 percent in January, the Labor Department said yesterday.
The increase, reported less than a week before the Federal Reserve's committee on setting interest rates is scheduled to meet, was a reminder that inflation remained a cloud over the economy's recovery. It also drew more attention to the government's report on consumer price inflation, which is to be released this morning. 
 Economists widely expect that report to show a slight climb in consumer prices in February. But after the producer price report was released, some economists forecast a larger increase.
 ''Inflation has been elevated and consistently stubborn,'' John Shin, an economist with Lehman Brothers, said. ''That's a crucial reason why we think that the hope for near-term Fed rate cuts is a bit misguided.'' 
 Yesterday Lehman Brothers increased its forecast for overall consumer inflation for the month to 0.5 percent, from 0.3 percent, based on the new producer price data. 
 While some economists flinched at the numbers, the stock market did not. In recent weeks, stock markets worldwide have been jolted by fears that the United States economy is more vulnerable to a downturn than economists initially thought. But Wall Street appeared unmoved by the report, and closed up mildly from Wednesday, even though investors were expecting far tamer numbers. 
 The Labor Department's report also showed that the core index for producer prices, a less volatile measure than the overall rate because it strips out energy and food prices, doubled from January, to 0.4 percent. That, too, far exceeded economists' forecasts. Higher prices for tobacco and light trucks -- sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans -- helped raise the core rate.
 The rise in the overall inflation was driven largely by food and energy prices, pushed up by a cold snap last month. Gasoline prices rose 5.3 percent last month, after falling 13 percent in January. The price of home heating oil rose 6 percent, after falling 8.3 percent in January. 
 Utility companies also reported higher prices; residential electricity rose 1.1 percent, compared with a 0.4 percent increase in January, and residential gas jumped 4.1 percent, after a 1.9 percent fall in January.
 Food prices rose in nearly every category, from fresh fruits and melons (up 15.7 percent) to pork (up 4.9 percent). Citrus prices in particular remained high because of a deep freeze in California this winter.
 Economists said a number of factors, from harsh weather to increased demand for corn to make ethanol, have pushed food prices up in recent months. ''There are a number of people in the market starting to become worried about food price inflation,'' Andrew Tilton, an economist with Goldman Sachs, said. ''That is something that could end up being a more persistent trend.''
 Another potentially worrisome statistic in the report was that core inflation for intermediate goods used in the early stages of manufacturing, like car parts and lumber, rose for the first time in six months. 
 ''Inflation pressures are still there in general, and they're still at a level that the Fed is not comfortable with,'' said Peter E. Kretzmer, senior economist with Bank of America. ''The Fed still has work to do, and we have to remain cognizant that if we're looking for the Fed to respond to a softer economy, they're going to find it more difficult to look away from these inflation risks.''
 Kenneth Beauchemin, an economist with Global Insight, said, ''There's been an upward creep, and that's a little unsettling.''
 In a separate report, the Labor Department said that first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell 12,000 last week, to 318,000.

HEADLINE: Attack on Sadr City Mayor Hinders Antimilitia Effort

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and DAMIEN CAVE; Ahmad Fadam contributed reporting from Baghdad, and Iraqi employees of The New York Times from Baquba, Tikrit and Hilla.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, March 15 

 BODY:
Gunmen ambushed a convoy on Thursday that was carrying the mayor of the sprawling Shiite area known as Sadr City, seriously wounding him and complicating American efforts to rein in a powerful Shiite militia there. The attack killed Lt. Col. Muhammad Motashar, the director of the Sadr City police station.
 The mayor, Rahim al-Daraji, has led negotiations with the Americans over what to do about the militia, the Mahdi Army, which has rebelled twice against the Iraqi government and the American military.
He has lobbied the Americans to finance reconstruction projects that would bring jobs to his impoverished neighborhood, an approach American commanders say could help disarm the largely unemployed men in the Mahdi Army. 
 Mr. Daraji is a soft-spoken sheik whose office has been a regular stop for American military officers in Sadr City.
 Early this month, American and Iraqi forces moved into Sadr City and have been trying to establish two garrisons there. Throughout Baghdad, American forces plan to operate out of 100 neighborhood garrisons in the next month as part of the new offensive to secure the city, the American commander in charge of Baghdad said Thursday.
 Nearly 80 such garrisons are operating. The increase in outposts is part of the plan to put American troops back on the streets, living among Iraqis and making their presence felt, he said. Thousands of additional American troops are expected to enter the Baghdad area by May to bolster forces here.
 ''So far, the indicators are they'll do real well,'' the American commander, Maj. Gen. Joseph F. Fil Jr., said of the garrisons. ''But we do expect them to be challenged.''
 The expansion of the garrisons is essentially a repudiation of the military policy of the last two years, in which American troops spent more time on bases and much less time patrolling or interacting with Iraqis. Critics of the White House and the American military say the emphasis on minimizing American casualties, called force protection, allowed Baghdad and other parts of Iraq to descend into sectarian bloodletting. 
 Now, American soldiers in the garrisons are expected to do what they did in 2003 -- meet with Iraqi leaders to discuss social and economic issues, shake hands with residents and walk the markets.
 General Fil acknowledged that the American soldiers would be at greater risk, but said they would be ready to defend themselves. The heightened American street presence may already have contributed to an increase in the percentage of American deaths that occur in Baghdad. 
 Over all, the number of American soldiers killed in Iraq from hostilities since Feb. 14, the start of the new Baghdad security plan, fell to 66, from 87 in the previous four weeks. 
 But with more soldiers in the capital on patrol and in the neighborhood garrisons, a higher proportion of the American deaths have occurred in Baghdad -- 36 percent after Feb. 14 compared with 24 percent in the previous four weeks. Also over the past four weeks, a higher proportion of military deaths from roadside bombs have occurred in Baghdad -- 45 percent compared with 39 percent.
 A roadside bomb killed four American soldiers and wounded two on Thursday as the soldiers returned from a search operation in eastern Baghdad, the military said. Ordnance experts at the scene found another bomb, a particularly deadly type called an explosively formed projectile, that had not been detonated, the military said.
 Despite such attacks, many Iraqis, especially those in predominantly Sunni Arab neighborhoods, say they welcome the Americans in their streets. 
 Moderate Sunni Arabs say they have been targets of Shiite militias like the Mahdi Army and radical Sunni groups. Sunni neighborhoods in western Baghdad are increasingly the scene of fighting between moderate Sunni Arabs and hard-line Sunni militants, and the moderate Sunnis see the Americans as potential allies.
 The American garrisons are of two kinds: joint security stations in which units of 120 to 150 troops operate with Iraqi forces, and combat outposts that serve as temporary forts. The joint security stations are expected to be permanent, perhaps transformed into Iraqi police stations.
 General Fil said the American and Iraqi forces regularly based in Baghdad are being supplemented by nine Iraqi Army battalions from outside. Each battalion has 700 officers or soldiers, he said.
 In the four weeks of the security plan, the kind of killings usually attributed to Shiite militias or death squads dropped by a third, General Fil said. Shiite militia commanders say Moktada al-Sadr, the firebrand Shiite cleric, has told his Mahdi militia to lie low for now. Suicide car bombs remain a problem, and American and Iraqi forces have made it a priority to root out car bomb factories, he added.
 In the Green Zone, an Iraqi appeals court ruled Thursday that Saddam Hussein's former vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, is to be hanged in 30 days. 
 The decision, which is final, completes a reversal of fortune for Mr. Ramadan, who was sentenced last November to life in prison for his role in the killing of 148 men and boys from the Shiite town of Dujail in the 1980's. A series of appeals increased the sentence to death. 
 When Mr. Hussein, the former Iraqi leader, was executed in December for the same killings, it stirred up discontent across the Middle East because he, a Sunni Arab, was subjected to sectarian taunts by Shiites at his hanging. Iraq's judicial efforts took another macabre turn a month later when Mr. Hussein's half brother Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti was decapitated by the hangman's noose after he dropped through the trapdoor. 
 In Mr. Ramadan's case, international human rights groups have argued that the evidence of his role in the crimes does not justify a death sentence. But the nine-judge appeals panel ruled unanimously for execution, said Munir Hadat, one of the judges. He denied accusations that the ruling reflected a political effort by Iraq's Shiite-led government to inflict extreme punishment on aides close to Mr. Hussein.
 ''The decision, it's not political,'' Mr. Hadat said at a news conference. ''The judges, all of them, are independent.'' Noting that Iraqi law required that executions be carried out within 30 days, he said the hanging could take place ''at any moment.'' An announcement about the execution, he said, would be made after it was completed.
 Violence roiled central and northern Iraq on Thursday. A suicide car bomb at an Iraqi security checkpoint in downtown Baghdad killed at least eight soldiers and policemen and wounded at least 29 people, an Interior Ministry official said. A homemade bomb in Sadr City killed one person and wounded four others, and a car bomb in Yarmouk killed at least one Iraqi soldier and wounded two people. The police found 17 bodies across Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official said. 
 A car bomb outside a factory in the area around Iskandariya, south of Baghdad, killed at least four workers on a bus and wounded at least 24. In Kifil, gunmen ambushed a convoy carrying the local police chief on Wednesday, injuring him and killing his driver, officials said Thursday. That prompted the police to arrest at least 44 Mahdi militiamen, and a Sadr-affiliated legislator in the national Parliament accused the police of burning a Sadr mosque in the area. A mortar round killed a civilian nearby in Hilla.
 Near Tikrit, Mr. Hussein's hometown, a senior policeman and his driver were killed late Wednesday. The police found the bodies of two women in the region on Thursday. In separate incidents on Thursday in Diyala Province, insurgents killed at least seven people and abducted at least four Iraqis. The body of an abducted policeman was found near a prison on Thursday. The American military said Thursday that a soldier was killed in combat in Anbar Province on Wednesday, and a Marine died there, also on Wednesday, in a noncombat incident. In Mosul, American forces accidentally killed an Iraqi soldier and wounded three others in a firefight with insurgents on Thursday, the military said.

HEADLINE: In Lebanon Camp, a New Face Of Jihad Vows Attacks on U.S.

BYLINE: By SOUAD MEKHENNET and MICHAEL MOSS; Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting from Washington, and Margot Williams from New York.

DATELINE: TRIPOLI, Lebanon 

 BODY:
Deep in a violent and lawless slum just north of this coastal city, 12 men whose faces were shrouded by scarves drilled with Kalashnikovs.
 In unison, they lunged in one direction, turned and lunged in another. ''Allah-u akbar,'' the men shouted in praise to God as they fired their machine guns into a wall.
The men belong to a new militant Islamic organization called Fatah al Islam, whose leader, a fugitive Palestinian named Shakir al-Abssi, has set up operations in a refugee camp here where he trains fighters and spreads the ideology of Al Qaeda.
 He has solid terrorist credentials. A former associate of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda of Mesopotamia who was killed last summer, Mr. Abssi was sentenced to death in absentia along with Mr. Zarqawi in the 2002 assassination of an American diplomat in Jordan, Laurence Foley. Just four months after arriving here from Syria, Mr. Abssi has a militia that intelligence officials estimate at 150 men and an arsenal of explosives, rockets and even an antiaircraft gun. 
 During a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Abssi displayed his makeshift training facility and his strident message that America needed to be punished for its presence in the Islamic world. ''The only way to achieve our rights is by force,'' he said. ''This is the way America deals with us. So when the Americans feel that their lives and their economy are threatened, they will know that they should leave.'' 
 Mr. Abssi's organization is the image of what intelligence officials have warned is the re-emergence of Al Qaeda. Shattered after 2001, the organization founded by Osama bin Laden is now reforming as an alliance of small groups around the world that share a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam but have developed their own independent terror capabilities, these officials have said. If Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who has acknowledged directing the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and a string of other terror plots, represents the previous generation of Qaeda leaders, Mr. Abssi and others like him represent the new.
 American and Middle Eastern intelligence officials say he is viewed as a dangerous militant who can assemble small teams of operatives with acute military skill.
 ''Guys like Abssi have the capability on the ground that Al Qaeda has lost and is looking to tap into,'' said an American intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Mr. Abssi has shown himself to be a canny operator. Despite being on terrorism watch lists around the world, he has set himself up in a Palestinian refugee camp where, because of Lebanese politics, he is largely shielded from the government. The camp also gives him ready access to a pool of recruits, young Palestinians whose militant vision has evolved from the struggle against Israel to a larger Islamic cause.
 Intelligence officials here say that he has also exploited another source of manpower: they estimate he has 50 militants from Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries fresh from fighting with the insurgency in Iraq. 
 The officials say they fear that he is seeking to establish himself as a terror leader on the order of Mr. Zarqawi. ''He is trying to fill a void and do so in a high-profile manner that will attract the attention of supporters,'' the American intelligence official said.
 Mr. Abssi has recently taken on a communications adviser, Abu al-Hassan, 24, a journalism student who dropped out of college to join Fatah al Islam. His current project: a newsmagazine aimed at attracting recruits.
 The arc of Mr. Abssi's life shows the allure of Al Qaeda for Arab militants. Born in Palestine, from which he and family were evicted by the Israelis, Mr. Abssi, 51, said he stopped studying medicine to fly planes for Yasir Arafat. He then staged attacks on Israel from his own base in Syria. After he was imprisoned in Syria for three years on terrorism charges, he said he broadened his targets to include Americans in Jordan.
 The Times arranged to speak with Mr. Abssi through a series of intermediaries, who helped set up meetings in his headquarters at the Nahr al Bared refugee camp. Mr. Abssi, a soft-spoken man with salt-and-pepper hair, was interviewed in a bare room inside a small cinderblock building on the edge of a field where training was under way. About 80 men were in the compound, performing various tasks, including one who manned an antiaircraft gun. As Mr. Abssi spoke, two aides took notes, while a third fiddled with a submachine gun. A bazooka leaned against the wall behind him.
 In a 90-minute interview, his first with Western reporters, Mr. Abssi said he shared Al Qaeda's fundamentalist interpretation and endorsed the creation of a global Islamic nation. He said killing American soldiers in Iraq was no longer enough to convince the American public that its government should abandon what many Muslims view as a war against Islam.
 ''We have every legitimate right to do such acts, for isn't it America that comes to our region and kills innocents and children?'' Mr. Abssi said. ''It is our right to hit them in their homes the same as they hit us in our homes.
 ''We are not afraid of being named terrorists,'' he added. ''But I want to ask, is someone who detonates one kilogram a terrorist while someone who detonates tons in Arab and Islamic cities not a terrorist?''
 When asked, Mr. Abssi refused to say what his targets might be. 
 [This week, Lebanese law enforcement officials said they arrested four men from Fatah al Islam in Beirut and other Lebanese cities and were charging them with the February bombing of two commuter buses carrying Lebanese Christians. Mr. Abssi denies any involvement and says he has no plans to strike within Lebanon.]Fertile Soil for Militants
 Inside the Palestinian camp, Mr. Abssi seems to be building his operation with little interference. 
 Maj. Gen. Achraf Rifi, general director of Lebanon's Internal Security Forces, says the government does not have authority to enter a Palestinian camp -- even though Mr. Abssi is now wanted in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria on terrorism charges.
 To enter the camps, he said, ''We would need an agreement from other Arab countries.'' He said that instead the government was tightening its cordon around the camp to make it harder for Mr. Abssi or his men to slip in and out.
 Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon have long been fertile ground for militancy, particularly focused on the fight against Israel. But militants in those camps now have a broader vision. In Ain el Hilwe camp, an hour's drive south of Beirut, another radical Sunni group, Asbat al Ansar, has been sending fighters to Iraq since the start of the war, its leaders acknowledged in interviews.
 ''The U.S. is oppressing a lot of people,'' the group's deputy commander, who goes by the name of Abu Sharif, said in a room strewn with Kalashnikovs. ''They are killing a lot of innocents, but one day they are getting paid back.'' A leading sheik in the camp, Jamal Hatad, has a television studio that broadcasts 12 hours a day with shows ranging from viewer call-ins to video of Mr. bin Laden's statements and parents proudly displaying photographs of their martyred children.
 ''I was happy,'' Hamad Mustaf Ayasin, 70, recalled in hearing last fall that his 35-year-old son, Ahmed, had died in Iraq fighting American troops near the Syrian border. ''The U.S. is against Muslims all over the world.''
 On the streets of the camp, one young man after another said dying in Iraq was no longer their only dream. 
 ''If I had the chance to do any kind of operation against anyone who is against Islam, inside or outside of the United States, I would do the operation,'' said Mohamed, an 18-year-old student, who declined to give his last name.
 Hussein Hamdan, 19, who keeps a poster of Osama bin Laden in the bedroom he shares with two sisters, is a street tough attuned to religious fundamentalism. He dropped out of school at age 10, spent 18 months in jail on assault charges, and in March -- ''just to make a statement,'' he said -- took a razor and repeatedly slashed both his forearms. ''I want to become a mujahedeen and go to jihad in any country where there are Jews or Americans to fight against them,'' he said.
 Lebanon has increasingly become a source of terror suspects. One of the Sept. 11 hijackers came from Lebanon, as did six men charged with planting bombs on German trains last summer. Two other Lebanese men and a Palestinian were among those accused last spring of plotting to blow up the PATH train tunnels beneath the Hudson River.The Killing of Innocents
 Mr. Abssi said he derived much of his spiritual guidance from Abu Abdullah Muhammad al-Bukhari, a ninth-century Islamic scholar. A recent study by the Defense Department's Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, N.Y., listed Mr. Bukhari among the 20 Islamic scholars who had greater influence today among militant Arabs than Mr. bin Laden.
 ''Originally, the killing of innocents and children was forbidden,'' Mr. Abssi said. ''However, there are situations in which the killing of such is permissible. One of these exceptions is those that kill our women and children.''
 ''Osama bin Laden does make the fatwas,'' Mr. Abssi said, using the Arabic word for Islamic legal pronouncements. ''Should his fatwas follow the Sunnah,'' or Islamic law, he said, ''we will carry them out.''
 His closest known association with Mr. Zarqawi involved the killing of Mr. Foley. In previously undisclosed court records obtained by The Times, Jordanian officials say that Mr. Abssi helped organize the assassination, working closely with Mr. Zarqawi.
 A senior administrator for the United States Agency for International Development, Mr. Foley was leaving his home in Amman on Oct. 28, 2002, when he was shot at close range by a man who had hidden in his garage. Seven bullets from a 7-millimeter pistol struck his neck, face, chest and stomach, the Jordanian government said in court papers.
 Eleven men were charged in the case, and two men have been hanged, including the gunman, Salem Sa'ad Salem bin Saweed. According to the court records, Mr. Saweed met Mr. Abssi five years earlier in Syria, where they became friends and ''arranged military operations against American and Jewish interests in Jordan.'' Mr. Zarqawi provided the $10,000, along with $32,000 more for additional attacks, the court papers say. But in meeting Mr. Saweed, Mr. Zarqawi told him to work through Mr. Abssi, who helped the gunman with money, logistics and training in weapons and explosives.
 Mr. Saweed and an accomplice in Jordan chose Mr. Foley as a target by watching his neighborhood for cars bearing diplomatic plates.A Valid Target
 In the interview with The Times, Mr. Abssi acknowledged working with Mr. Zarqawi. He said he played no part in Mr. Foley's death, but considered him a valid target. ''I don't know what Foley's role was but I can say that any person that comes to our region with a military, security or political aim, then he is a legitimate target,'' he said.
 [Mr. Foley's widow, Virginia Foley, said Wednesday that she thought her husband's killers had either been killed or jailed. ''I'm appalled and surprised that there is still somebody out there,'' she said, when told of Mr. Abssi's current activities.]
 The American intelligence official said the prosecution of Mr. Foley's killers was under the control of the Jordanians.
 At the time of Mr. Foley's death, Mr. Abssi had been in jail for two months, having been arrested on charges of plotting attacks inside Syria. He ultimately served three years in prison, says Mounir Ali, a spokesman for the Ministry of Information.
 Mr. Ali denied recent reports in Lebanon that Syria sent Mr. Abssi to that country to stir trouble there. ''This accusation is baseless,'' Mr. Ali said. ''After he was set free he restarted his terrorist activities by training elements in favor of Al Qaeda.''
 He said Syria sought his arrest in late January, but discovered Mr. Abssi had ''disappeared, and no one knew where he went.''
 Late last November, Mr. Abssi moved into the Palestinian camp here, seized three compounds held by a secular group, Fatah al Intifada, raised his group's black flag, and issued a declaration saying he was bringing religion to the Palestinian cause. Mr. Abssi reappeared on Jordan's radar in January when police had a three-hour battle with two suspected terrorists in the northern Jordanian city of Irbid, killing one of the men. Authorities say they learned that Mr. Abssi had sent the men. A short while later, Lebanese authorities picked up two Saudi Arabian men leaving Mr. Abssi's camp, and learned both men had fought in Iraq. Two more men were found leaving the camp in February, General Rifi said.
 General Rifi said officials were trying to learn as much as possible about Mr. Abssi's operation from sources and surveillance, but it was clear that their information was limited. In questioning people, security officials are showing a photograph of Mr. Abssi that is 30 years old, though it displays his most distinctive feature -- two moles, one on each side of his nose.
 The apparent inability to apprehend Mr. Abssi provokes fury in the men who are hunting him. A security official in one of the countries where he is wanted scowled when asked why Mr. Abssi was operating freely: ''I can go lots of places to grab people, but I can't grab him.''
 In the interview with The Times, Mr. Abssi said he had been largely warmly received in the Palestinian camp, and that he was optimistic about his cause. ''One of the reasons for choosing this camp is our belief that the people here are close to God as they feel the same suffering as our brothers in Palestine,'' he said.
 ''Today's youth, when they see what is happening in Palestine and Iraq, it enthuses them to join the way of the right and jihad,'' he said. ''These people have now started to adopt the right path.''

HEADLINE: Big Deficit Seen in New Jersey Pension Fund

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH and DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
A prominent member of the council that oversees investments by New Jersey's pension funds said yesterday that the state has been vastly underestimating how much money it should have to pay for retirement benefits that have been promised to employees.
 The council member, Douglas A. Love, said a more realistic calculation would show a $56 billion deficit -- more than three times as much as the $18 billion included in the state's most recent bond-offering statement. 
Public employees' unions and others have long accused New Jersey of mismanaging its pension funds. But in a presentation to the council, Mr. Love pointed to the use of what he said were inappropriate methods to calculate the value of the benefits promised.
 ''There is no financial enterprise in the world that is allowed to value its liabilities'' the way New Jersey, and other public pension funds, measure the value of theirs, said Mr. Love, the chief investment officer for Ryan Labs Inc. in New York.
 Mr. Love's way of calculating the pension's obligations is similar to the method a bank or an insurance company would use. New York City's chief actuary, Robert C. North, has been using that method to show that the city's pension deficit may be billions more than shown in official projections. 
 Nearly all public pension funds use traditional actuarial practices, which have been coming under increasing scrutiny in recent years from economists and some actuaries who say those practices vastly understate the benefits that have been promised.
 Mr. Love's new analysis comes at a time when Gov. Jon S. Corzine and the Legislature are struggling to close a $2 billion budget shortfall, trim the state's more than $30 billion debt load and rein in property taxes. 
 Mr. Corzine has proposed studying the possibility of leasing state toll roads to help pay down state debt. 
 State workers are now wrangling over whether to ratify a tentative labor contract that would for the first time require that employees increase their contribution to the state pension fund, while also raising the retirement age for new employees to 60 from 55.
 At the regular monthly meeting of the investment council, held at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, Mr. Love warned that if the state continued to underestimate the total value of the benefits its employees are earning, it will be unable to set aside enough money to cover those costs. Almost inevitably, future taxpayers would end up paying the cost of today's government services.
 He also asserted that New Jersey should get ready for new accounting rules that would probably require pensions to be measured using a method that is more accurate. At that point, he said, the credit rating agencies would no longer be satisfied with current numbers, which tend to shrink the amounts that state and local governments owe. 
 The ratings agencies would presumably be concerned if governments with a great deal of bond debt, like New Jersey, have also promised generous pensions without setting aside enough money to pay for them. New Jersey's pension system is the ninth largest in the public sector, with assets of about $75 billion as of last September. 
 Tom Vincz, a spokesman for the state treasurer's office, which is responsible for the management of the pension funds, said Mr. Love was ''highly regarded'' and that his analysis ''underscores the seriousness of New Jersey's problems.''
 ''The unfunded liability is measured in several ways already, and all of the ways result in a profoundly large number,'' Mr. Vincz said. ''Whether it's $24 billion or $34 billion or $54 billion -- whatever the number is, it's large, and it's something that the administration is working to address on all fronts in both a short-term and long-term way.'' 
 Mr. Love said that the benefits New Jersey's public employees had already earned were worth $132 billion in current dollars -- substantially more than the $91.6 billion they are reported to be worth in actuarial calculations. He stressed that this number included only what New Jersey's public employees have earned up until now, and did not include projections of the benefits they will earn over the rest of their careers.
 He also said that $132 billion might itself understate their benefits, because he had not been able to correct all of the actuarial distortions that he suspected were entrenched in New Jersey's pension system. He said, for example, that he thought New Jersey might be underestimating people's life spans.
 Mr. Love also said New Jersey was wrong to call the $91.6 billion a ''liability'' in the first place. He said that it was an actuarial calculation that, technically speaking, should really be called a ''funding target.'' 
 But because actuaries called it a liability, it had been erroneously called that by accountants in the state's financial statements, he said, causing great confusion. 
 Virtually all public pension funds use the same terminology in their financial statements, causing some economists to offer predictions that there are large, unfunded obligations in towns, counties, states and other government bodies all across America.
 The independent body that issues the accounting rules for these governments has expressed an interest in revising the rules for reporting pensions. But it moves very slowly.
 Arthur Levitt Jr., the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently called for accounting rule-makers to reform their procedures. In a recent opinion column published in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Levitt said the rule-makers had ''fallen captive to constituent groups'' that were ''slowing their progress or even diverting their efforts to keep pace with critical issues.''
 Mr. Love's remarks were intended to explain to the council some fundamental changes that New Jersey has begun to make in the pension fund's investments.
 Already, the state's division of investments has shifted some of its pension portfolio out of stocks, and into fixed-income instruments like bonds. In particular, the state is seeking fixed-income instruments with payment schedules tailored to match the amounts the pension must pay retirees in the future.
 For the same reasons, the state is studying possible future investments by the pension fund in physical assets that will produce long-term streams of cash payments, like the New Jersey Turnpike.

HEADLINE: U.N. Council Gets New Draft Decree on Iran Nuclear Sanctions

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 15 

 BODY:
The Security Council received on Thursday a draft of a new resolution to impose sanctions on Iran for its defiance of demands that it suspend its nuclear enrichment activities and return to negotiations over its nuclear program.
 The measure expands a roster from an earlier resolution that lists companies and individuals subject to an assets freeze. Among them are Bank Sepah, four groups controlled by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite military force, and seven commanders identified as ''key persons'' in the corps.
 The draft also says that Iran is prohibited from exporting any arms or material related to its weapons programs and that other countries should make sure that none of their citizens transport or purchase any such material from Iran. 
 Alejandro D. Wolff, the acting American ambassador, said the draft was ''a good, balanced, incremental step,'' while Emyr Jones Parry, the British ambassador, said it was a ''ratcheting up'' of restrictions in the last resolution on Iran.
 That measure, adopted on Dec. 23, called for Iran to cease nuclear activities within 60 days or face further action. Iran not only ignored the Feb. 21 deadline but also announced that it was accelerating its enrichment schedule.
 The new document is a result of weeks of negotiations among Germany and the five permanent members of the Council, Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, and was agreed to overnight after last-minute reviews in the six capitals.
 It will now be discussed by the 10 other members of the Council, effectively postponing a vote until late next week.
 The United States and the European countries involved in drafting the resolution wanted tougher steps but had to factor in objections from China and Russia, which maintain close commercial ties with Tehran and protested any terms that could harm the Iranian economy or public.
 Instead of the broad ban on imports of weapons that the Americans wanted, the draft calls on countries to ''exercise vigilance and restraint'' in supplying Iran with heavy weapons, including tanks, combat aircraft and artillery systems, or with any training or technical assistance connected to such weapons.
 Also dropped from the original proposal is a ban on international travel by Iranian officials engaged in nuclear activities. It was replaced by a call on nations to notify the Council if any of the named people pass through their territory.
 The text calls on countries and financial institutions to curb all grants, financial aid and loans to Iran except those ''for humanitarian and developmental purposes.''
 The draft gives Iran 60 days to comply or face a threat of additional penalties, which the text specifies would be nonmilitary.
 In keeping with the drafters' repeatedly stated wish to persuade Iran to return to negotiations, however, it emphasizes that all measures will be suspended if Tehran halts enrichment activities.
 After 60 days, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, is to report to the Council on whether Iran has met the demand to cease enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. Such a report last month led to the current draft resolution.
 Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said this week that he wanted to come to New York to appear at the session where a vote will be held. Richard A. Grenell, the spokesman for the United States Mission, said that an official request for a visa had been received Thursday. The Iranian party will include 38 others, most of them security people, he said.
 Dumisani S. Kumalo, the ambassador of South Africa who is Council president this month, said normal procedures allowed for high-level representatives of a country that is the subject of a Council debate to appear before the panel and speak. 
 Mr. Wolff, the American representative, said, ''I find it again ironic that President Ahmadinejad, who is quoted today as saying that he tears up Security Council resolutions and has no respect for what the Security Council says, is interested in coming and addressing the Council.''
 Uranium enrichment is the first step in making fuel that can be used for nuclear power plants, but is also necessary for making nuclear arms. Iran has asserted its national right to pursue nuclear energy for generating electricity, but the United States and European nations contend that its real purpose is making bombs. 
 The December resolution ordered all countries to stop supplying Iran with materials and technology that could contribute to its nuclear and missile programs and to freeze the assets of 10 Iranian companies and 12 individuals conducting the programs. The new draft identifies 15 individuals and 13 companies. 
 The presentation on Thursday was made in response to complaints from the 10 nonpermanent members of the panel that Germany and the five permanent members in the past had labored for weeks in private on a text, only to submit it to the full Council and demand speedy approval. 
 Mr. Kumalo said the Council would insist on not being treated like a ''rubber stamp.''

HEADLINE: G.M. Says It Has Found Serious Flaws In Accounting

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 15 

 BODY:
General Motors, a company once known as the model of corporate accounting, warned investors on Thursday that its performance was threatened by ''ineffective'' controls over financial reporting, including inadequately trained personnel and failure to obtain management's approval for some transactions.
 The disclosure, made in G.M.'s annual report filed with federal regulators after a six-week delay, was the latest indication that the automaker is on shakier footing than first thought. 
It comes a day after G.M. restated five years of financial results and reported that it lost $2 billion in 2006 -- a significant improvement over the previous year's $10.4 billion loss but a sizable negative number nonetheless.
 In the annual report, G.M., whose accounting practices are already under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, said an internal evaluation found its financial reporting methods to be inadequate. ''The lack of effective internal controls could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to carry out our strategic business plan,'' the company said.
 The filing listed 41 other factors that could hinder G.M.'s performance, including the potential for a strike by the United Automobile Workers union, whose contract with the three Detroit automakers expires in September.
 G.M., which reduced its fixed costs in North America by $6.8 billion in 2006, largely by offering buyouts to workers, said it would ''vigorously'' pursue further cost cuts in the new labor contract, particularly related to retiree health benefits. It acknowledged that such demands will be unpopular with the union.
 ''Any U.A.W. strikes, threats of strikes, or other resistance in connection with the negotiation of a new agreement could materially adversely affect our business,'' the filing said.
 Shares of G.M. declined 88 cents, or 2.9 percent, to close at $29.38 Thursday.
 G.M. said it would address its accounting deficiencies by reorganizing its tax department, hiring more accounting personnel able to deal with its complex corporate structure and requiring more thorough reviews at the end of each quarter.
 ''This is clearly on the top of mind of many people here,'' a G.M. spokeswoman, Renee Rashid-Merem, said. ''It's being addressed in a very prudent and swift way.''
 The changes follow several restatements of previous years' financial data. In some cases revised numbers were later modified again, raising concerns among investors and analysts about how much to trust the figures being reported.
 ''It has become such a pattern now,'' an analyst with Fitch Ratings, Mark Oline, said of the restatements.
 In December, the company hired a former AT&T executive, Nicholas S. Cyprus, to be its controller and chief accounting officer. About a year ago, G.M. vowed to tighten its accounting standards after restating six years of results and disclosing that the S.E.C. was investigating the accounting for certain transactions related to pensions, suppliers and precious metals.
 In late 2005, after G.M. said it had discovered accounting errors, the company's chief financial officer, John Devine, said he would step down; he was succeeded by Frederick A. Henderson. Six weeks ago, when G.M. said it would delay reporting fourth-quarter results, Mr. Henderson told employees in a e-mail message, ''Errors that require restatements are unacceptable and embarrassing for the corporation and for me personally,'' according to The Detroit News.
 G.M.'s accounting problems are yet another reminder how far the automaker has fallen from its peak years. G.M. gave investors audited financial statements in the 1930s, before they were mandatory, and for decades accountants held it up as the most prestigious of employers for their profession.
 David Wright, an accounting professor at the University of Michigan, said G.M. was only one of many companies to disclose accounting problems in recent years since laws were enacted demanding more transparency in financial reporting. ''And in some small defense of G.M.,'' he said, ''it is one of the largest and most complicated multinational organizations.''
 Still, Professor Wright described G.M.'s accounting mistakes as ''a serious issue.''

HEADLINE: Bear Stearns Profit Rises 8% Despite Weak Subprime Market

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Bear Stearns Companies, Wall Street's largest underwriter of mortgage securities, said yesterday that its first-quarter profit rose 8 percent despite turmoil in the subprime lending sector. 
 Its profit rose to $548.5 million, or $3.82 a share, from $508.7 million, or $3.54 a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended Feb. 28, rose to $2.48 billion from $2.19 billion last year.
Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expected earnings of $3.80 a share on revenue of $2.49 billion.
 Bear Stearns, one of the largest investment banks on Wall Street, said the recent defaults in the subprime mortgage industry had a minor impact on its performance. 
 The company, which is based in New York, said revenue from residential mortgages decreased from the prior year period, reflecting weakness in the market for mortgage-backed securities. 
 Samuel L. Molinaro Jr., Bear Stearns's chief financial officer, said the company's exposure to subprime loans represented about 3 percent of its mortgage business. He said he has not seen the difficulties so far evident in subprime mortgages spread to lower-risk prime loans.
 ''Last year, we reduced our exposure in the subprime market, cutting our origination and securitization almost in half,'' he said. ''We think we've done a good job navigating what have been very difficult markets conditions. We're feeling comfortable where we are.''
 Its fixed-income business posted a revenue increase of 27 percent, to $1.1 billion during the quarter, while revenue from equity sales and trading rose 3 percent, to $513 million.
 Revenue from investment banking grew 3 percent, to $303 million, as strong stock underwriting and acquisition advisory business was offset somewhat by weakness in merchant banking. 
 The company said revenue from its capital markets segment rose 15 percent, to $2 billion from $1.7 billion. It had a sharp increase in revenue from trading debt of companies that have filed for or face the likelihood of bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Despite Inflation Trend, Small but Nervous Gains

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks managed a moderate advance yesterday as signs of strength in corporate takeover activity, jobs and overseas markets allowed investors to stomach a sharp rise in wholesale inflation.
 Wall Street still displayed nervousness, however, selling off briefly after comments by Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, rekindled investors' fears about subprime mortgages.
Trading was erratic at other points in the session, but most investors chose to pick up bargains yesterday after a 242-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday. A 57-point recovery on Wednesday suggested that the market would hold above the index's 12,000 mark, at least for now. 
 ''There's some optimism because the market had fallen quite a bit and it showed resilience yesterday, which is encouraging,'' said Edgar E. Peters, chief investment officer at PanAgora Asset Management in Boston, adding that the sentiment could shift on the Consumer Price Index's release today. 
 A bidding battle for the commodities exchange CBOT Holdings also gave stocks a lift. Despite the cooling economy, merger and acquisition activity has been surging, reassuring some investors that problems in some sectors have not seeped into the economy more broadly.
 The Dow rose 26.28 points, to 12,159.68. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 5.11 points, to 1,392.28, and the Nasdaq composite advanced 6.96 points, to 2,378.70.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.93, to 783.61.
 Stocks briefly retreated after Mr. Greenspan said at a conference in Boca Raton, Fla., that mortgage lenders' troubles could spill into the broader economy if home prices declined substantially.
 There was also a short pullback in stocks ahead of the Philadelphia Fed's manufacturing index, which showed that the region's manufacturing growth slowed in March. Wall Street had expected an increase. 
 The Labor Department's Producer Price Index jumped by 1.3 percent in February, twice the amount the market was forecasting.
 But investors largely shrugged off the reports yesterday, not shocked that manufacturing was retreating and hopeful that even though inflation was high, economic weakness could compel the Fed to lower rates.
 ''People should be thinking that the odds of the Fed cutting rates are pretty slim this year, but there seems to be this dogged optimism, or blind hope, that that will happen,'' Mr. Peters said.
 The Fed meets next week to decide whether to adjust short-term interest rates. It is expected to keep rates unchanged.
 Stocks got a lift from IntercontinentalExchange's unsolicited $9.9 billion all-stock bid for CBOT Holdings. CBOT had already agreed to an $8 billion takeover by Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings.
 CBOT rose $28.86, to $194.95; ICE fell $3.83, to $128.10; and Chicago Mercantile fell $31.09, to $532.88.
 In other takeover news, Cisco Systems agreed to acquire the Web conferencing company WebEx for about $3.2 billion in cash, while General Electric's Capital Solutions business and the Blackstone Group agreed to buy the PHH Corporation for $1.69 billion. PHH provides mortgage and vehicle fleet management services.
 Cisco fell 4 cents, to $25.81; WebEx rose $10.18, to $56.38.
 G.E. rose 21 cents, to $34.52, and PHH rose $3.29, to $31.10.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 1/32, to 100 22/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.54 percent, from 4.53 percent.

HEADLINE: Romney Candidacy Puts Massachusetts Economy in Spotlight

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: BOSTON, March 14 

 BODY:
When Mitt Romney became governor of Massachusetts in 2003, the state had a budget gap of almost $3 billion and was losing thousands of jobs a month.
 In Mr. Romney's four-year tenure, the deficit was eliminated without raising the sales tax or the income tax, and since the labor slump hit bottom in December 2003, the state has gained 81,000 jobs.
As Mr. Romney seeks the Republican presidential nomination, his fiscal and economic achievements are central elements of his campaign. His first television commercial calls him ''the Republican governor who turned around a Democratic state.''
 But some in Massachusetts question how healthy the state's economic and fiscal condition actually is. Unemployment is still relatively high, and the new governor, Deval L. Patrick, a Democrat, says he is grappling with a budget gap of $1.3 billion. And some economic analysts say Mr. Romney has exaggerated some of his successes or taken credit for improvements that had more to do with national trends. 
 ''When he talks about a turnaround, we really haven't had a turnaround,'' said Michael J. Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes state economic policies. ''We had a temporary fiscal respite. But we're trailing the nation in job growth. Our job growth has been anemic.''
 David G. Tuerck, executive director of the Beacon Hill Institute, which describes itself as a ''free-market think tank'' and is considered to be on the conservative end of the spectrum, said he believed that Mr. Patrick was exaggerating the state's fiscal problems. But Mr. Tuerck added: ''I think that Romney probably inflated accomplishments. I think he got carried away with himself when he started talking about the surpluses that he was able to engineer.''
 A spokesman for Mr. Romney, Eric Fehrnstrom, vigorously defended the characterization of the Romney administration's economic performance.
 ''The governor balanced the budget every year and generated surpluses that went into the rainy-day fund,'' Mr. Fehrnstrom said. ''The governor inherited a fiscal basket case. State revenues had collapsed by 15 percent; the state economy was in a recession. You can't compare that to the situation that exists today. In 2007, the economy is creating thousands of new jobs every month; state revenues are growing.''
 No one disputes that Mr. Romney came into office facing a crisis: a budget gap projected to be nearly $3 billion in the wake of a precipitous drop in revenues nationally in the post-Sept. 11 climate. With a combination of spending cuts, revenue enhancements and consolidation of government agencies, he balanced the budget -- a requirement of Massachusetts law.
 The average unemployment rate fell to 4.8 percent in 2005 from 5.8 percent in 2003, the State Department of Workforce Development said, but has increased since then. It averaged 5 percent in 2006 and was 5.3 percent in January of this year, compared with a national rate of 4.6 percent. And despite the growth in jobs, the department reported that there are 124,100 fewer jobs than before the state's prerecession peak in February 2001.
 Mr. Fehrnstrom said that Mr. Romney's economic achievements included the signing of two economic stimulus bills, and that ''there were hundreds of companies who grew or relocated to Massachusetts with the assistance of the Romney administration and our resource team.''
 ''Did we recover all the jobs that were lost? No,'' Mr. Fehrnstrom said. ''But it's an objective fact that the economy turned around in Massachusetts under his watch.''
 As for the state's current budget problems, Mr. Fehrnstrom attributed them to lack of spending restraint by a legislature dominated by the Democrats. ''The fact is, he issued hundreds of millions of dollars in spending vetoes,'' Mr. Fehrnstrom said of Mr. Romney, ''and many of those vetoes were overturned by the legislature.''
 Scott Pattison, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said most states' economic experience paralleled that of Massachusetts in the years Mr. Romney was governor. 
 ''For the most part, revenue went down so bad and since then, for most states and most revenue sources, it went back up,'' Mr. Pattison said. ''People could just argue all day about whether it was direct impact of a state policy or whether it was just national economic activity.''
 Still, Mr. Romney's economic claims have supporters here, even among Republicans who are not supporting his presidential bid.
 ''I'm not like a big Romney booster, but on this he's totally correct,'' said State Senator Richard R. Tisei, a Republican who is a co-chairman of Rudolph W. Giuliani's presidential campaign in Massachusetts. ''He got a bad rap.''
 State Senator Bruce E. Tarr, also a co-chairman for Mr. Guiliani's campaign, said Mr. Romney ''provided some pretty strong fiscal discipline.'' 
 One of Mr. Romney's most prominent legacies is most likely to be passage of a health insurance plan that would make the state the first to provide nearly universal coverage. The law, which requires individuals to buy insurance beginning in July and sets up a mechanism for insurers to offer a range of affordable health plans, will cost the state government about $1.8 billion, but all but $200 million of that will come from federal and existing state money.
 Mr. Romney tried to eliminate more than $50 million of that extra cost by vetoing Medicaid coverage of dental care and other services. The legislature reinstated those provisions, arguing that they were necessary.
 The Massachusetts plan is being watched closely by other states. The economic and budgetary consequences are not yet clear and will depend in large part on rising health care costs.
 Mr. Romney's economic claims are more modest than those made by another Massachusetts governor who ran for president: Michael S. Dukakis, who in the 1988 election sought unsuccessfully to capitalize on a booming economy called the ''Massachusetts Miracle.'' Mr. Dukakis was badly beaten by the elder George Bush, and a couple of years later, the Massachusetts economy stumbled and tax increases were the order of the day. 
 Mr. Romney says he did not raise taxes, but some critics say that is not entirely accurate. There was no broad-based tax increase -- no change in the income tax, sales tax or gas tax -- but Mr. Romney did increase some fees, and he instituted changes that he called closing corporate tax loopholes, which some consider a euphemism for raising corporate taxes.
 Mr. Widmer, the taxpayers foundation official who served on Mr. Patrick's transition team but has also advised Republican governors, is critical of the Romney administration's claims in 2005 and 2006 that the state had a $1 billion surplus. He said that the surpluses were actually smaller because in 2005 the budget shorted the pension fund $500 million, and in 2006 the $1 billion surplus figure included $600 million from the rainy-day emergency fund.
 Mr. Fehrnstrom and the state senators, Mr. Tarr and Mr. Tisei, said the $1 billion surpluses existed at one point but were spent by the legislature over Mr. Romney's objections.
 In any case, Mr. Widmer said, any surpluses were driven not by structural changes in the economy but by something largely beyond a governor's control: increases in capital gains tax revenue as a result of a rebounding stock market.
 ''His public statements vastly overstated where we stand,'' Mr. Widmer said.
 Stephen P. Crosby, who helped lead the budget committee of Mr. Patrick's transition team, but was also a high-ranking budget official in two Republican administrations, was critical of a blueprint for the 2008 budget that Mr. Romney released just before he left office. Mr. Crosby said that while Romney budget officials told Mr. Patrick's transition team to brace themselves for a deficit in the 2008 fiscal year, the budget blueprint made the fiscal situation look better than that.
 ''It's legitimate for him to say that he was a prudent budget manager during some relatively difficult times,'' said Mr. Crosby, who is dean of the McCormack Graduate School of Policy Studies at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. ''But when he went out the door, he announces a budget that is ostensibly a balanced budget and that was definitely made-up artifice.''
 Mr. Fehrnstrom shrugged off that criticism saying that Mr. Romney had issued the blueprint only as a suggestion and that ''it was just an estimate.''

HEADLINE: Hamas Aligns With Fatah But Aid Remains in Doubt

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Taghreed El-Khodary contributed reporting from Gaza, and Khaled Abu Aker from Ramallah.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 15 

 BODY:
The Hamas-led Palestinian government, boycotted by the West since its election more than a year ago because of Hamas's support of terrorism, announced Thursday a unity coalition with the more moderate Fatah movement in hopes of ending the boycott. 
 But the political document guiding the new government does not fulfill the international community's three demands -- to recognize Israel, forswear violence and accept previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements -- and Israel announced that it would therefore not deal with the new government or any of its ministers, Hamas or not. The United States is expected to follow suit but the European Union will face a fierce internal debate about whether to continue its isolation of the Palestinians.
Miri Eisin, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, said Mr. Olmert would continue ''to maintain dialogue with the elected Palestinian president,'' Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah, known as Abu Mazen, ''who does accept the three principles.'' 
 Other Israeli officials complained that Mr. Abbas had failed to make good on his promise to Mr. Olmert last week that a captured Israeli soldier, Cpl. Gilad Shalit, would be released before a new government is formed. ''If Abu Mazen could deliver Shalit, he would, but he can't,'' an Israeli official said. ''So it raises new questions about his ability to deliver,'' meaning that Mr. Olmert's discussions with him will be limited, the official said, ''to the improvement of the quality of Palestinian life.''
 The new government, still led by Prime Minister Ismail Haniya and dominated by Hamas, contains some moderate figures from Fatah and independent parties, including the finance minister, Salam Fayyad, and it was greeted with relief by ordinary Palestinians, who hope that it will be able to pay their salaries and put an end to internal warfare. 
 The diplomatic struggle over whether to funnel aid through Mr. Fayyad is just beginning. Germany, which currently holds the presidency of the European Union, is likely to support Israel, as will Britain.
 The French foreign minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, said in Paris that the new Palestinian government ''could open a new page in relations with the international community.'' But he also called for the immediate release of Corporal Shalit and for an end to ''all forms of violence against Israel and its citizens.''
 The European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, said the European Union would wait to see the government list as approved by the Palestinian legislature, expected on Saturday, and the political document that governs it. 
 A State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said similarly that Washington ''will wait until the government is actually in place and we have an understanding of what their platform will be before we make any final judgments about it.''
 The document was slowly negotiated on the basis of a unity statement put together by Palestinian prisoners in Israel jails and was pushed along early in February at a meeting called by the Saudis in Mecca. 
 Mr. Abbas argues that it implicitly meets international demands, and argues further that as the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, he is the only legal negotiator for the Palestinians in any case.
 The document mentions Israel only as an occupier of Palestinian land. It does not recognize Israel's right to exist and does not explicitly accept previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements, but says the agreements, including international agreements, will be ''respected.''
 And it does not forswear violence. On the contrary, it ''affirms that resistance is a legitimate right of the Palestinian people.'' It says ''halting resistance depends on ending the occupation and achieving freedom, return and independence,'' a reference to ''the rights of Palestinian refugees and their right of return to their lands and properties.'' Israeli officials called that ''a step backward'' from the agreement in Mecca.
 The document does call for an extension of the often-broken cease-fire by Israel and the Palestinians and for further discussions on how to organize the many -- and often competing -- Palestinian security forces.
 One of the main aims of the unity government is to end the violence that has broken out between Hamas and Fatah in recent months. 
 In Gaza, an Abbas aide, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, said the main aims of the government were ''internal security and ending the suffering of Palestinians,'' by getting aid abroad to again pay full salaries and stopping the internal clashes. Mr. Haniya said the main aim was ''internal security.''
 In Gaza, Mustafa el-Sawaf, a political analyst close to Hamas, noted the continuing Hamas-Fatah clashes and said, ''One can say there is really no Palestinian consensus on the program. I give this government six months.'' 
 One of the sticking points in the negotiations was the Interior Ministry post, which had been held by an important Hamas figure, Said Siam, who is said to oppose this new agreement with Fatah. The two sides settled on a bureaucrat, Hani al-Qawasmi, 50, whose family is from Hebron in the West Bank but who was born and lives in Gaza. 
 But most experts expect that he will have little power, and that the Executive Force, set up by Mr. Siam in Gaza as a parallel police force loyal to Hamas, will continue to be controlled by Hamas leaders. 
 Diana Buttu, a former adviser to Mr. Abbas and to the key Fatah figure in Gaza, Muhammad Dahlan, noted that except for the deputy prime minister, Azzam al-Ahmed, the head of the Fatah faction in the legislature, the Fatah ministers were relatively unknown and untainted by accusations of corruption. 
 ''Fatah needs time to reorganize and reform and is playing for the next elections,'' Ms. Buttu said. ''This government is based on 'samoud,' or steadfastness. It doesn't seem to have any other policy, and Palestinians have no real expectation that they will do anything about serious problems.''
 Hamas also appointed a number of lesser-known figures, leaving out of the government well-known hard-liners like Mr. Siam and Mahmoud Zahar, who had been foreign minister. While Israel sees the unity government as a victory for Hamas, it is clear that some key Hamas figures are very unhappy with the coalition, which makes Hamas look less principled and more willing to compromise to keep its hold on cabinet seats.
 The new foreign minister is a former Fatah member and independent, Ziad Abu Amr, who has a Ph.D. from Georgetown and was supported by Hamas, but who also has close ties to the West.
 The new government has 25 ministers. In a complicated formula, Hamas controls the most seats, then Fatah, while the two factions also control the appointment of some independent figures. There are also members of four other parties in parliament, including Mr. Fayyad and Information Minister Mustafa Barghouti.
 In Ramallah, there was relief and hope. Said Batrawi, owner of Samir Restaurant, said: ''This is great news. We want law and order so we can feel there is authority and government. We need the siege to be lifted so we can improve the economy.''

HEADLINE: Call for Speed Limit Has German Blood at 178 m.p.h. Boil

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: PFAFFENHAUSEN, Germany, March 14 

 BODY:
Ask Marc Bongers about the wisdom of introducing a speed limit on the German autobahn, and he answers by impatiently revving the 435-horsepower engine of a specially modified Porsche. Slowpokes, he said, already spoil half the fun.
 ''A lady,'' Mr. Bongers sniffed, as a Mercedes scuttled out of his way in the passing lane on a busy highway in southern Bavaria. ''And she's talking on her phone,'' he said the other day, shooting her a sidelong glance. ''Doesn't she know it's against the law to do that on the autobahn?''
With a stretch of empty road ahead, Mr. Bongers floored the gas pedal, and within seconds the speedometer registered 286 kilometers an hour (178 m.p.h.) -- something that is still legal here. That, by way of comparison, is about the speed of a commercial jet taking off. 
 Few things are closer to the German heart than the freedom to drive like Michael Schumacher, the fabled Formula One champion. Rule-bound and risk-averse in so many other ways, Germans regard driving on the autobahn at face-peeling speeds as close to an inalienable right.
 Now, though, Germany's love of speed is colliding with its fears about global warming, as it becomes clear that its Sunday race-car drivers are spewing tons of carbon dioxide into the air.
 Last week, the European Union's environment commissioner, Stavros Dimas of Greece, set off a national debate here by suggesting that the German government introduce a general speed limit on the autobahn.
 To be sure, at least half of the 7,500 miles of autobahn already have either permanent or temporary speed limits. But the autobahn's anything-goes stretches are the world's fastest public roads. 
 ''Speed limits are useful for many reasons, and are the order of the day in most of the E.U.'s 27 member states and the United States,'' Mr. Dimas said in an interview with the mass-market newspaper Bild. ''Strangely enough, it is only in Germany where they are controversial.''
 No kidding. His mild words were met with heated indignation from politicians and automotive groups here. Some acted as if Brussels were demanding that Germany outlaw beer and bratwurst.
 This is ''a trivialization of the climate problem,'' declared the German environment minister, Sigmar Gabriel. The German Association of the Automotive Industry said Germans needed ''no coaching'' from other Europeans on how to protect the environment.
 Even Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has put climate change at the top of her agenda as current president of the European Union and the Group of 8 industrial nations, opposes a uniform speed limit.
 She is hardly a car buff. Unlike her predecessor, Gerhard Schroder, she is rarely photographed behind the wheel. But she seems to realize that, like Social Security in the United States, the autobahn is the third rail of German politics -- potentially deadly to those who dare touch it.
 Critics brandish statistics that show a speed limit of 120 kilometers an hour (75 m.p.h.) would reduce Germany's overall carbon-dioxide emissions by a few million tons a year, less than 0.5 percent. Better, they say, to focus on building more efficient power plants and houses.
 Yet, as environmental groups and a few lonely politicians point out, a few million tons of carbon dioxide is still a considerable savings. Unlike other measures -- clean coal plants or hybrid cars, for example -- a speed limit could be imposed tomorrow and at relatively little cost.
 ''Our politicians like to say that Germany should not have to do more than other European countries on climate change, but in this area, we are doing less,'' said Josef Goppel, one of the few conservative members of Parliament who favor a limit.
 For years, speed limit advocates tried to argue their case on safety grounds. The autobahn, though, is statistically safer than highways in many countries, even if its crashes are singularly horrific. Saving the planet, it turns out, may be more persuasive than saving lives.
 ''Given the pride of Germans about being No. 1 in protecting the environment, this could lead to a breakthrough,'' said Peter Schneider, a writer who limits himself to 90 m.p.h. on the autobahn.
 Mr. Schneider is realistic. Driving fast, he said, is deeply rooted in the German psyche -- a form of expression that survived even World War II. It is an addiction that crosses social and political boundaries.
 ''I have friends who are left-leaning intellectuals, and they're proud to tell me they can get to Hamburg from Berlin in two hours,'' Mr. Schneider said. (That requires driving an average of 87 m.p.h.)
 Germany also has a powerful economic incentive to resist a speed limit. It builds some of the world's fastest cars, and the autobahn is a valuable showcase and marketing tool for the industry. A tour operator even organizes driving tours of the highway for Chinese visitors.
 Car connoisseurs from around the world flock to Pfaffenhausen, a one-horse town where the local company, Ruf Automobile, makes cars with many horses. Mr. Bongers, the sales manager, said people who bought these custom-modified Porsches often took them for a spin on the autobahn. For most, it is the only place they can legally test the top speed of their new toys.
 ''It's a kind of freedom,'' said Mr. Bongers, 40, who once pushed his own Porsche 911 to over 187 m.p.h. to prove he had the guts to do it. ''Speed is relative on the autobahn.''
 Alois Ruf, a courtly, nattily dressed man who took over the family business from his father in 1974, said he did not know enough about the science to judge whether a speed limit would significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. But the debate feels oddly familiar to him.
 In the depths of the oil crisis in late 1973, West Germany imposed a speed limit of 100 kilometers an hour (60 m.p.h.). Four months later, the government rescinded it. Mr. Ruf recalls worrying during those dark days that the family's sports car business was doomed.
 ''This is a dream we are selling to the world,'' he said. ''It's a tradition I think we have to defend.''

HEADLINE: Rising Trouble With Mortgages Clouds Dream of Owning Home

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER and VIKAS BAJAJ; Stephen Labaton contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
Perhaps the American dream of homeownership is not for everyone.
 That may sound at odds with a bedrock notion of society promoted by presidents for decades. But many experts say it is a message that can be drawn from the rising troubles with mortgages provided to home buyers with weak credit.
Several large mortgage companies have stopped making new loans, and others have tightened lending standards. 
 Hundreds of thousands of families who bought houses in the last two years -- using loans with low teaser interest rates and no down payments -- are now losing them. 
 Their short tenure as homeowners calls into question whether the nation's long drive to increase homeownership -- pushed by both public policy and financial innovations -- has overstepped some boundary of demographic and economic sense.
 ''Clearly we went too far,'' said Joseph E. Gyourko, a professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''It's not the case that high homeownership is always good.''
 Consider Nathaniel Shields, who expects to lose his four-bedroom Cape Cod house in southwest Chicago to a foreclosure in May. 
 He cannot afford his mortgage payment, which jumped to $1,300 a month from about $1,000 after his loan reset to a higher interest rate last summer. A divorce and the loss of his county government clerical job, which paid $14.80 an hour, have also hurt.
 In 2004, Mr. Shields took out a popular hybrid mortgage that carried a fixed interest rate for two years before becoming an adjustable-rate loan for the remaining 28 years. In August, his loan's interest rate rose from 6.6 percent to 8.1 percent, and to 9.6 percent now. ''I love the house,'' said Mr. Shields, 47, who now works in a custodial job with the Chicago school district that pays $10.40 an hour. ''I put a lot of money in the house -- a deck and a new garage -- and they are just going to take the house.'' 
 Kathleen Van Tiem, a counselor at Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, has been trying to help him, but says that his weak credit and low income make him ineligible to refinance or modify his loan. Mr. Shields has put his house up for sale, but in a market with many homes available, he has found no takers.
 There were surges in homeownership rates last century, but further gains have been slow going more recently, despite the hoopla of the housing bubble and the surge in home building. 
 The nation's homeownership rate has increased by only about 1.4 percentage points since 2000, to almost 69 percent last year.
 But subprime mortgages -- granted to borrowers like Mr. Shields with weak, or subprime, credit histories -- played a big role in achieving those levels.
 This push, however, has meant intense financial strain for many families. Subprime borrowers will spend nearly 37 percent of their after-tax income on mortgage payments, insurance and property taxes this year, according to estimates by Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Economy.com, drawn from Federal Reserve data. 
 This is about 20 percentage points more than prime borrowers and 10 points more than what subprime borrowers paid in 2000. 
 And their payments will get higher, Mr. Zandi estimates, as low teaser rates used to lure them into the market adjust upward after a few years. 
 When the housing market started weakening, subprime borrowers were the first to feel the squeeze. Almost 8 percent of subprime mortgages -- more than 450,000 loans -- were either in foreclosure or in arrears of more than three months in the fourth quarter of last year, according to the mortgage bankers. 
 Their unraveling means not only a string of failed lenders. Homeownership rates have slipped, and many low-income families, who dedicated meager savings toward a stake in their first homes, are facing foreclosure. 
 ''I worry that people are overexposed to risk,'' said Stuart S. Rosenthal, an economics professor at Syracuse University. ''We wouldn't encourage people to buy risky stocks, so why do we encourage low-income families to invest in this risky asset, especially in tight markets?''
 But politicians have long encouraged the idea of homeownership. ''A nation of homeowners is unconquerable,'' Franklin D. Roosevelt said. Promoting homeownership has been a cornerstone of President Bush's ''ownership society.'' He has declared June to be National Homeownership Month. 
 And government has played a substantial role in fostering homeownership -- including offering mortgage insurance and creating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy mortgages from lenders and repackage them for sale to investors. 
 Moreover, the government has provided an ever-growing pile of subsidies to the buyers of homes. 
 The mortgage interest deduction, the biggest single subsidy to homeowners, will cost the federal budget about $80 billion this year, according to the administration's projections. Deductions for state and local property taxes will cost $15.5 billion. 
 Allowing homeowners to pocket tax-free much of the profit from selling their homes is expected to cost $37 billion more. Altogether, this amounts to almost 5 percent of the federal government's total tax revenue, and almost three times HUD's entire $42 billion budget. Now even some in Washington are questioning the soundness of pushing homeownership so broadly.
 United States policies in recent years promoted the idea of homeownership too hard and at the expense of rental housing, said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts. ''I wish people could own more homes,'' he said in an interview yesterday. ''But I also wish I could eat and not gain weight.''
 And the government's efforts to promote homeownership are far from an unqualified success. From 2000 to 2005, homeownership rates increased significantly only among households in the top two-fifths of the income distribution, those earning more than $46,883, according to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey. 
 Homeownership declined for families in the bottom two-fifths of the income scale. In the lowest fifth -- where families make less than $20,180 -- homeownership was only 42.4 percent in 2005, which was 3 percentage points less than it was 25 years earlier and 26 percentage points below the national average.
 Part of the reason is the structure of government subsidies, which are worth very little to low-income families but quite a bit to families with big incomes. Those well-off families typically do not need government support to buy a home but use it to buy bigger places than they would otherwise purchase. 
 The mortgage interest deduction alone is worth about $21,000 to a taxpayer in the highest bracket of income with a $1 million mortgage. But for a typical family that bought, say, a $220,000 house with 20 percent down, the break is worth about $1,600. 
 Some economists question whether the government should be subsidizing homeownership in the first place. 
 Edward L. Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard, said he could understand government ''giving a slight push to increase homeownership, but the current incentives are much more than a slight push.''
 Economic studies do suggest that homeowners try to maintain the value of their properties -- tending to their gardens and investing in their communities. But it is not clear that homeownership itself fosters these behaviors; it could be that people who invest in their communities prefer to own their own homes.
 Homeownership also has a more problematic side: it locks people into an asset and ties them to a place. ''Too much homeownership might restrict mobility, and that may not be a good thing,'' Professor Gyourko said.
 Take Adam Gardner, a 29-year-old appraiser who bought a three-bedroom, two-bath house 20 miles north of Reno, Nev., for about $255,000 two years ago. His wife is pining to move closer to town, but with housing prices falling all around him, Mr. Gardner doubts they can pull it off. ''I'm not sure we can sell the place we are in,'' Mr. Gardner said.
 Some people can bear tying up much of their wealth in a house -- those with a secure, well-paid job in a stable labor market, for instance. But others might need more freedom to move: the young in pursuit of love or careers, say, or workers in declining job markets. 
 The American dream of homeownership may continue to grow over coming decades, if only because the population is aging and older people are more likely to own their own home. But for now, even industry insiders acknowledge that, at the very least, it is going to take a breather.
 Ted J. Grose, a mortgage broker in Los Angeles, said, ''For the moment we may have plateaued.'' For all the concerns about low-income families facing foreclosure, some economists believe that the development of the subprime credit market has, over all, been a boon for people with low income. 
 Harvey S. Rosen, a professor of economics at Princeton who was a former economic adviser to President Bush, put it this way: ''Ultimately the public policy choice is going to be whether to make it harder for people to get these loans, and just shut people out, or let people make the choice and know that sometimes they will make mistakes.''

HEADLINE: Taming Fossil Fuels

 BODY:
Each day seems to bring news of another prominent convert to the cause of requiring mandatory reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Each day also seems to bring news of technological advances that would make it possible to achieve those reductions without serious economic damage. Put all these glad tidings together, and Congress has all the reasons it needs to move quickly to regulate global warming emissions here at home, thus setting an example for the world. 
 Last week the chief executives of America's largest automobile companies -- General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and Toyota North America -- pledged to support mandatory caps on carbon emissions, as long as the caps covered all sectors of the economy. They delivered their promise to a House committee run by John Dingell -- the crusty Michigan Democrat who is another convert to the cause and has taken to describing the global warming threat with phrases like ''Hannibal is at the gates.''
Meanwhile, dozens of major institutional investors organized by Ceres, a coalition of investors and environmentalists, will gather in Washington on Monday to offer support for mandatory controls. The group will include Calpers, the huge California state pension fund with a history of making environmentally friendly investments, and Merrill Lynch, whose credentials are less impressive. 
 The news on the technology side is also good -- particularly several recent announcements about coal. The first came from TXU, a huge Texas utility where the bidders have agreed to drop plans to build 11 old-fashioned coal-burning power plants. TXU has now announced that it will build two experimental plants intended to capture carbon dioxide before it escapes into the atmosphere. American Electric Power, another large utility, has also announced that it will build a coal-fired plant based on slightly different technology but with the same intended result: capturing carbon.
 The importance of these projects cannot be overstated. As a report released Wednesday by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology observed, coal produces more than 30 percent of America's carbon dioxide emissions. It is also a huge problem in China, where the equivalent of one large coal-fired power plant is being built each week, using antiquated methods. Unless coal can be tamed, the game is essentially lost.
 But while technology will play an indispensable role, the lead authors of the M.I.T. report, writing in The Wall Street Journal, argue that the most effective way to reduce emissions is to attach a significant price to carbon emissions, either as a carbon tax or through a cap-and-trade program of the sort now embodied in various legislative proposals in Congress. Forcing people to pay to pollute would do more than any other known incentive to bring new technologies to commercial scale. That is the task before Congress.

HEADLINE: Despite Buildup, China Insists Its Goals Are Domestic

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 16 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China said Friday that his country is still trying to overcome major obstacles to its internal development and suggested that it will not seek to disrupt the world order dominated by the United States.
 In a nationally televised news conference wrapping up the National People's Congress, Mr. Wen deflected a series of questions about China's rising financial and military power and its fast-growing emissions of gases that contribute to climate change. He argued that China remains a developing country that must study the experiences of richer nations, and which will always act responsibly on the world stage.
Chinese leaders have long followed a public relations strategy that emphasizes modesty and avoids intimations of political, economic or diplomatic ambition. But Mr. Wen's defensive tone was notable because China's trade surplus, foreign exchange reserves, military spending and pollution have all surged under his leadership in the past four years, raising concerns about the country's growing impact on the outside world. 
 Mr. Wen stressed that his focus remained squarely on overcoming ''hidden crises'' that threatened to undermine China's economy, which he said remained ''unbalanced, uncoordinated, unstable and unsustainable,'' even as it grows rapidly. He said the country must also address the ''overconcentration of power'' that has fueled rampant corruption, while doing more to help the poor.
 ''The two great tasks are, first, develop the productive forces of society and, second, advance social justice and fairness,'' he said. ''The speed of the fleet is not determined by the fastest vessel, rather it is determined by the slowest one.''
 Mr. Wen said that even as China explores new ways to invest more than $1 trillion in foreign currency reserves in overseas assets, Beijing still amounts to a small player in world financial markets and ''will not have any impact on U.S.-dollar-denominated assets'' globally.
 He also claimed that China's military spending, ''whether in absolute terms or in relative terms,'' amounts to less than that of many wealthy countries and some developing countries.
 China's official military budget for 2007 rose 18 percent to $45.3 billion, continuing a decade-long streak of double-digit increases. Even at that level, which the Pentagon maintains understates China's actual defense outlays by a factor of two or three, China's military budget in 2007 exceeds that of Japan and is fast approaching those of Britain and France, the largest military spenders after the United States.
 Asked to explain China's recent firing of an antisatellite missile that successfully destroyed one of China's own defunct satellites in space, Mr. Wen answered obliquely. He stressed that the test -- which he referred to as ''an experiment in outer space,'' rather than the firing of a ground-based ballistic missile into space -- was aimed at no other country. He said China favors a treaty banning the use of arms in space.
 ''China's position on the peaceful utilization of outer space remains unchanged,'' he said.
 China has become the largest consumer of energy after the United States and by some estimates the largest emitter of gases that contribute to global warming after the United States as well.
 Mr. Wen said China intends to ''act in a responsible manner'' and work toward reducing emissions, even though it does not have to meet mandatory targets for reducing emissions under the Kyoto Protocol to fight global warming.
 The prime minister also said that China needs to pursue ''political reform'' to combat corruption, which he acknowledged had infiltrated the ''top ranks'' of the ruling Communist Party. Late last year, Chen Liangyu, a member of the Politburo and the Shanghai party boss, was stripped of his position on accusations of graft.
 But in response to a question about how long it might take China to become a democracy, Mr. Wen provided a lengthy answer that conflated what Communist Party officials call democracy with the concept as it is known and practiced in the West.
 He said that China was already a ''socialist democracy,'' but added that China still needs a long time before it perfects its democracy.
 Quoting a traditional party line, Mr. Wen said: ''Socialist democracy in its most fundamental form is to let the people be the masters of their own home. This must include the right to democratic elections, democratic decision making, democratic administration and democratic supervision.''
 That notion of democracy has prevailed in China since Mao's rule. The Communist Party views it as consistent with maintaining its monopoly on political power.
 Even so, Mr. Wen said Western nations should not preach to China about overhauling its political system.
 ''Democracy, rule of law, freedom, human rights, equality and fraternity do not belong solely to capitalism,'' he said. ''These are the results of a world historic process that mankind has gone through together.''
 Mr. Wen and other Chinese officials view such rights and freedoms as achievable under one-party rule. 
 He did not touch on the historic private property law the National People's Congress passed earlier on Friday.
 Mr. Wen appeared to be caught off guard when asked about the political views of Zhao Ziyang, a late leader of the Communist Party who was purged after he opposed the use of force to quell dissent during the 1989 democracy protests in Beijing.
 Mr. Zhao's thoughts on democracy and political reform were the subject of a book published in January in Hong Kong by a confidante of the former leader, who died in 2005.
 Mr. Wen answered the question tersely. ''I have not read this book,'' he said.
 The book is banned in mainland China. And although Mr. Wen's news conference was carried live on Chinese television, all references to Mr. Zhao were subsequently struck from the official transcript and edited out of a Webcast of the session.

HEADLINE: World Briefing Africa: Zimbabwe: Mugabe Accuses His Own Party

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
President Robert G. Mugabe appeared to lash out at officials in his own party, warning the party's Youth League in a speech of ''an insidious dimension where ambitious leaders have been cutting deals with the British and Americans'' to unseat him. Some in the party, known as ZANU-PF, have sought to engineer the retirement of Mr. Mugabe, 83, fearful that the nation's economic freefall will loosen their grip on power. Mr. Mugabe has defied them, hinting that he may seek another six-year term. Zimbabwe has been on alert for weeks in the face of increasingly defiant protests. MICHAEL WINES

HEADLINE: Picking Stocks That Don't Smoke, Drink or Make War

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND. 
E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ALMOST seven years ago, when we moved to New York from London and were trying to figure out how to invest our paltry nest egg, I mentioned to a financial adviser that I was interested in putting our money into socially responsible investments.
 He looked unimpressed and told me that it was feasible, but that we probably would not get as high a return on our investments. I said I was still interested. And then more or less forgot about the whole thing.
But lately I have been thinking that it may be time to be a little less passive. Why should we be putting what little money we have into companies whose labor or environmental practices we might strongly disagree with -- or, in fact, whose very product we might find abhorrent?
 Of course, nothing is that simple. Once I started delving into the world of socially responsible investing, the sharply drawn lines of black and white merged into gray. 
 Although socially responsible investments have grown substantially over the last 10 years, they still represent a small part of the world of investments under professional management: 9.4 percent, according to a report by the Social Investment Forum, a trade group for the industry (www.socialinvest.org).
 Socially responsible investing dates back hundreds of years and has a religious cornerstone, said Steven J. Schueth, president of First Affirmative Financial Network, an investment advisory firm that focuses on such investments. Methodists, for example, did not want to invest in sin stocks, meaning companies that sold tobacco or liquor, and Quakers refused to invest in slavery or war.
 It was during the 1980s that I and many others became aware of investing as a political strategy -- pressuring companies that did business with South Africa's apartheid government.
 Negative screening to eliminate companies that do or make things you do not like is one way to choose an investment. According to the Social Investment Forum's report, ''2005 Report on Socially Responsible Investing Trends in the United States,'' the most common product people screen out is tobacco. More than 88 percent of the total assets in the universe of socially screened funds are in tobacco-free companies. 
 Less common is screening out companies that are reputed to violate human rights, or that traffic in pornography or test products on animals. Those factors are taken into account in 5 percent to 10 percent of socially screened fund assets.
 The opposite approach to such investments is positive screening, or actively seeking out companies that operate in a way that supports your political beliefs or at least meets your standards for good corporate citizenship.
 And that is where it gets tricky.
 Numerous companies focus on such investing. Among the best known are Calvert, Domini Social Investments and Pax World Funds. But if your notion of a socially responsible investment is, say, a small wind-power company or a health food start-up, you may be surprised that Amy Domini, chief executive of Domini Social Investments, also has McDonald's on her list.
 ''When it comes to a McDonald's, it's very much on our watch list and we always struggle with it,'' Ms. Domini said. ''But we attempt to draw from the better 50 to 60 percent of the universe available to us.'' The strategy is known as ''best in class'' -- McDonald's may not be the most socially responsible company over all, but it may be one of the better companies in the fast-food industry.
 McDonald's has improved its packaging over the years in response to concerns about the environment, and its beef does not come from cattle raised on land that was once rainforest, Ms. Domini said.
 ''It's horrific how we raise chickens in this country, but McDonald's, while still horrific, is less horrific,'' she said. ''You have to keep your eye on the ball. It's hard to argue that they haven't made progress at McDonald's.''
 For some, that is too much of a compromise. Paul Hawken, a longtime environmental advocate and co-founder of the Smith & Hawken gardening tool business, ignited a debate several years ago when he wrote several articles critical of socially responsible investing, calling it ''so broad it is meaningless.'' 
 ''If a fund doesn't own companies involved with gambling and pornography, it can be called socially responsible,'' he wrote 
 But purity is subjective. Mr. Schueth tells of working with an animal rights activist who would not invest in anyone who had leather couches in the executive suite. 
 ''We said, 'We can do that, but it really limits your investment universe,' '' he said.
 Complicating matters is that a company that gets high grades in one area -- say, it sells a product deemed worthy, like organic foods -- may have flaws in another area, like labor relations.
 If specific political issues are important to you, it is possible to check out investment companies that cater to them. The Women's Equity Fund (www.womens-equity.com) invests in stocks that advance women in the workplace, for example. Portfolio 21 (www.portfolio21.com) and Sierra Club funds (www.sierraclubfunds.com) focus on companies they consider environmentally progressive.
 Lachlan Cooke, 46, of Seattle decided he would put some inherited money into socially responsible investments. 
 ''I'm not out manning the barricades, but I am socially conscious,'' he said. An avid tango dancer, he got the name of a financial adviser who works with such investments from his tango teacher. While he did not have many stipulations, he said, ''I wanted to make sure the companies didn't have ill-gotten gains from the war on Iraq.''
 He is also happy that his rate of return is comparable to that of other investment portfolios. And because the companies that deal with socially responsible investments are small, he gets a lot of attention.
 ''When I go to Merrill Lynch, I'm lucky to get someone to answer the phone,'' he said. ''It's a cliche, but I sleep well at night knowing that I'm part of the solution, not part of the problem.''
 And it helps his sleep to know he's not losing money.
 ''In the early days, people who wanted to invest in socially or environmentally responsible companies were not so concerned about performance, but wanted to see their money make a difference,'' Mr. Schueth of First Affirmative Financial Network said. ''Now they want to see their money do double duty. They want to make a difference, but they want to retire comfortably.''
 In the late 1990s and early 2000s, such investors were attracted to portfolios that focused on high-tech and health care, which were booming. But Mr. Schueth said the industry was now ''running into some headwinds,'' because tobacco and oil companies and weapons manufacturers -- unacceptable to most socially responsible investors -- have done particularly well over the last few years.
 Roy Weitz, publisher of Fund-Alarm.com, a Web site that takes a skeptical look at the mutual fund industry, said he believed that in the long run, socially responsible investments ''get a less optimal return, because any time you place artificial limits on what you invest in, you're limiting your upside.''
 Over the five years ended in February, for example, the total return of the Domini 400 index averaged 4.81 percent a year, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index averaged 6.81 percent. 
 ''We were largely a victim of a war economy,'' Ms. Domini said.
 But, Mr. Weitz said, one needs to consider the psychic rewards.
 ''If it makes someone feel good, who am I to judge?'' he said. 
 Besides ensuring that your money is not being used in ways you disapprove of, socially responsible investment has also evolved to include the practice of shareholder advocacy. Some shareholders use their ownership of stock to try to pressure companies to change their behavior.
 After thinking it over, I decided that socially responsible investment can be oversold on both sides: it can be so loosely defined that it means almost nothing, but it can also be too easy to cynically dismiss those who, as Mr. Weitz said, are at least ''trying to change the world one dollar at a time.''
 Cellphone battery update: The last Shortcuts column discussed whether it was possible to overcharge cellphone batteries (no), and several readers asked if that applied to car chargers as well as home chargers. The answer is yes, assuming you use a charger approved by the manufacturer.

(Photo by Stuart Isett for The New York Times)Chart: ''Guilt-Free Returns''Investing in socially responsible funds has grown in recent years because people view it as an agent for political or social change -- or a way to avoid investing in ''sin stocks.'' Investors can find companies by ''positive screening,'' which seeks out companies that produce things or operate in a way that an investor likes, or ''negative screening,'' which eliminates companies that do or make things an investor does not like.Graph tracks socially screened mutual funds (value of funds and number of funds) from 1995 to 2005.Top negative screens of mutual funds in 2005* by value of assets, in billions1.

HEADLINE: Inflation Data Discourages Investors

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street slumped again yesterday after another reading on inflation deflated hopes that the Federal Reserve would start moving toward an interest rate cut when it meets next week. The major indexes suffered moderate losses for the week. 
 The inflation reading was the latest report to upend expectations that the Fed might consider lowering rates as the economy gives off signs of slowing. The sentiment overshadowed a stronger-than-expected increase in industrial production.
 ''The market is dealing with the softer economic data that we're seeing and trying to reconcile that with the somewhat stiff inflation data,'' said Marie Schofield, fixed-income strategist and portfolio manager at Columbia Management Group.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 49.27 points, or 0.41 percent, to 12,110.41. The broader stock indicators also slipped. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.33 points, or 0.38 percent, to 1,386.95, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 6.04, or 0.25 percent, to 2,372.66.
 For the week, the Dow fell 1.35 percent, the S.& P. 500 index 1.13 percent and the Nasdaq 0.62 percent.
 In the Treasury market, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32, to 100 20/32. The yield remained at 4.54 percent.
 Inflation concerns remained a factor yesterday. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent in February and renewed some concerns that dogged stocks on Thursday. Wall Street had expected an increase of 0.3 percent. The rise was double that of January and the largest since a similar increase in December.
 But, the crucial core figure, which excludes the often-volatile food and energy prices, did not surprise Wall Street. It rose 0.2 percent as expected.
 The Federal Reserve reported industrial production increased 1 percent in February, well above the 0.3 percent increase analysts expected.
 Joe Balestrino, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors, contends investors are viewing economic data through the eyes of the Fed and not as much for what it says about the economy.
 The volatility and heavy volume that has returned to Wall Street after months of unusual calm surfaced again yesterday with the once-per-quarter expiration of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single-stock futures -- a confluence of expirations known on Wall Street as quadruple witching.
 Hard-hit subprime mortgage lenders rallied on word that the companies were taking steps to raise capital. Shares of Accredited Home Lenders jumped $1.47, or 15.6 percent, to $11.21 after the company, a subprime lender, announced plans to sell some loans at a discount to raise cash necessary to meet margin calls.
 Shares of another subprime lender, Fremont General, rose $1.50, or 20.3 percent, to $8.90 after Credit Suisse increased the company's credit line to $1 billion. The company said it received several proposals for additional credit.

HEADLINE: Some More Numbers to Juggle In Figuring Out Retirement

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN. 
E-mail: yourmoney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WHEN a group of economists argued recently that Americans might be saving too much for retirement, Fidelity Investments could not have disagreed more.
 The crux of the economists' arguments was that financial services companies were overestimating the percentage of preretirement income needed to live well when no longer working. The companies' online calculators usually place that figure at 85 percent.
(The companies point out that the calculator settings can be changed to fit any assumption and that 85 percent is a starting point, not a substitute for personalized retirement planning.)
 The economists -- a loose confederation of financial experts from universities, research institutions and the government -- said their research led them to believe that the rate could be closer to 65 percent for many people. 
 This week, Fidelity released some results of a survey of workers on how well they were saving for retirement. Guy L. Patton, executive director of the Fidelity Research Institute, said Americans on average were saving only enough to provide them with 58 percent of their preretirement income, counting personal savings, Social Security benefits and pension income.
 When Fidelity looked at specific age groups, the news was slightly more favorable. Baby boomers, those born from the end of World War II to 1964, have enough saved to provide them with 62 percent of preretirement income, the survey found. Those who told Fidelity they were on track to a comfortable retirement anticipated a 68 percent rate.
 If you believe in the wisdom of crowds, that might be further evidence that the contrarian economists are right when they say that 85 percent is excessive. After all, those who think a lot about saving may have arrived at their own rule of thumb.
 Fidelity still disagrees. ''Our sense is that is not nearly enough,'' said Mr. Patton, who notes that a savings rate of 10 percent to 15 percent for someone in their 20s is required to have enough to provide 85 percent of preretirement income. 
 Of course, using a 68 percent rule of thumb can be as arbitrary as using 85 percent. The only way to know is to examine your savings plan and use the resources of a financial services company to help determine if you are saving too much or too little. (Just recognize that it is their business to persuade you to save more.) Only 23 percent of respondents had detailed and formal retirement plans. 
 Speaking of the wisdom of crowds, Fidelity says that those Americans over age 25 who think they are saving enough save about 7.5 percent of their annual pay. Used Tires and Safety
 About 30 million used tires were sold in the United States last year, almost 10 percent of all replacement tires sold. 
 Used tires are a money-saving choice for people who need to replace tires on a leased vehicle or on a car they are planning to sell soon. A new Goodyear Eagle RS-A that goes for about $100 at a Big O tire store sells for about $18 at BorderTire.com, a used-tire dealer. 
 Jobbers collect used tires from tire stores and the auto departments of Wal-Mart or Sears after they are replaced with new tires. The used-tire companies can get about $1 each by scrapping them or up to $10 apiece selling them to tire dealers. The profit margins for used tires are far better than for new tires, which explains why almost every tire store sells them.
 Reputable dealers examine the tires and grade them. But the problem is that most consumers, unless they have a degree in polymer science, will not be able to see flaws in a tire. Some tires are detailed -- that is, meticulously cleaned -- and even painted so they look younger.
 Sean Kane, an auto safety consultant at Safety Research and Strategies (safetyresearch.net) in Rehoboth, Mass., said that although consumers look at the depth of tire tread, the real concern should be the age of the tire. He wrote in a recent issue of The Safety Record, his firm's newsletter, that ''tires age in a way that often cannot be detected visually.'' 
 A tire that looks new can be deteriorating internally, he said, in the same way that an old rubber band in your desk drawer might gradually develop cracks. It all depends on how the tire has been driven -- underinflation ruins a tire -- or where it has been stored. 
 Mr. Kane said that the scope of problem tires was unknown. But he said that he had found 108 incidents in which tires older than six years were involved in loss-of-control crashes. These incidents caused 85 deaths and 115 injuries. Slightly less than a third of the vehicles had tires that were bought used. 
 State governments regulate how much tread must be left on a tire -- the depth varies state to state -- but not the age or integrity of the tire's structure. Mr. Kane wants tires taken off the road after six years. 
 Howard Levy, president of UsedTires.com in Boca Raton, Fla., said Mr. Kane's proposal might not do consumers any favors. He said that rules regulating the age of tires on the road would mean consumers would spend more to swap out tires long before their useful life was over. The tire makers would love this, of course. ''I don't see where the real benefit comes for the consumer,'' he said. 
 If you want to know how old your tires are, look at the wall of the tire for the word ''DOT'' followed by six numbers. The first two designate the factory where it was made and the next four denote the week and year of its manufacture. For example, 3105 would mean the 31st week of 2005.
 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration site has information on that code and all the rest of the text on a tire at www.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/TireSafety/ridesonit/brochure.html#dotcode.Rewarding Punctual Debtors 
 Discover Financial Services says it wants to reward its best credit card customers. 
 Discover, a unit of Morgan Stanley with more than 50 million cardholders, defines its best customers as those who pay their bills on time but do not pay off their whole bill every month. They maintain a balance and pay interest as high as 18 percent on the money they have borrowed.
 Its new card, Motiva, will reward those people every six months by paying the next month's interest on their balance. 
 Margo Georgiadis, executive vice president and chief marketing officer of Discover, called it a ''breakthrough new product.'' The card is a result of research that showed that those who carried balances felt they deserved a reward for their patronage, she said. After all, reward cards, which Discover pioneered, repay the people who spend the most. About 50 percent of consumers carry a balance and 80 percent of them pay on time, the company said.
 Motiva also rewards spending. Cardholders get a 1 percent rebate on all purchases after they have spent $3,000.
 But what about the consumers who pay on time and do not run up debts? Where is their reward? 
 Ms. Georgiadis said she did not have a card for them. Maybe good behavior is its own reward. FOLLOW-UP -- One rap against Redfin, the online real estate brokerage company that issues rebates for a portion of its commission to customers, has been that its agents do not negotiate as well as full-service agents getting a full 6 percent commission. The company studied the Seattle market and found that its buyers' agents negotiated lower prices than were listed, while negotiations by traditional brokers resulted in a price above the listing price. The average difference amounted to $4,420 (www.redfin.com/stingray/do/landing-page?uid=pr-redfin-advantage).

HEADLINE: Fickle Investors Bobbing in Sea of Subprime Loans

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL

 BODY:
INVESTORS this week showed that while they are still ready to sell at a moment's notice, they remain unpredictable. 
 On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 242.66 points after the Mortgage Bankers Association issued a report indicating that a record number of homes have entered the foreclosure process, adding to fears about subprime mortgages.
 On Thursday, however, investors shrugged at a report that producer prices surged in February against all expectations, and focused instead on indications that the problem of subprime loans would not spread to other markets. Yesterday, the markets fell slightly on news that consumer prices, led by energy, also rose.
 Subprime loans continued to haunt New Century Financial, which said its banks had frozen its lines of credit. The former newspaper baron Conrad M. Black went on trial. Viacom sued Google. Patricia C. Dunn, formerly of Hewlett-Packard, dodged a bullet. And a surprise bid upset the planned merger of two big financial exchanges.FROZEN OUT -- New Century Financial said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that all its lenders had cut off credit and had demanded that the firm buy back $8.4 billion in loans. New Century said it could not do so, because it did not have the money. 
 The banks' attitude toward New Century is different from nearly a decade ago, when U.S. Bancorp bailed the company out. But the stakes are much higher this time, with default rates among subprime loans having spiked in the last six months. Trading in New Century shares was halted this week, their value having tumbled by 90 percent since the beginning of the year.
 Many large Wall Street banks began reporting first-quarter earnings late this week, and they wanted to be sure they could tell investors that their exposure to subprime loans was limited. So far, that's what they have done. Bear Stearns said as much on Thursday, sending its stock on an upward swing. 
 Morgan Stanley, which last week offered New Century a financing package worth $975 million, will report earnings next week. Some analysts said the offer was a tactic to better position Morgan Stanley in the event that New Century files for bankruptcy. BLACK ON TRIAL -- The fraud trial of Conrad M. Black, the former chairman of Hollinger International, got under way in Chicago. Mr. Black is behaving differently from other corporate executives facing trial. He's given dozens of interviews, made speeches and written articles chastising his accusers.
 Although many Americans have never heard of Mr. Black, the trial is a huge story in his native Canada. Hollinger, now called The Sun-Times Media Group, until recently owned several large Canadian daily newspapers as well as The Daily Telegraph in London, The Jerusalem Post and The Chicago Sun-Times. The trial is being held in Chicago because the company is registered there.
 If convicted, Mr. Black faces more than 90 years in prison. He is accused of paying himself unauthorized bonuses, of accepting improper payments from buyers of newspapers sold by Hollinger, and of misappropriating company funds for personal use. 
 Mr. Black said any improprieties were either a result of sloppy accounting or the fault of his former friend and partner, F. David Radler, who agreed to plead guilty to the charges and testify against Mr. Black. 
 The trial, which is expected to last two to three months, will have Henry A. Kissinger and Donald J. Trump as witnesses. WEB VIDEO SHOWDOWN -- Viacom stepped up the pressure on Google by accusing it in a $1 billion lawsuit of ''massive copyright infringement.'' The lawsuit also seeks to prohibit Google from committing further infringement via its YouTube online video service. 
 Google purchased YouTube last year for $1.65 billion on the expectation that it would make revenue-sharing deals with media companies whose content YouTube users upload to the site alongside home-produced videos. So far, Google has struck licensing deals with smaller media companies and limited agreements with larger ones. The company is in talks with other big media companies, but many of them are becoming frustrated with YouTube users' uploading their copyrighted content even as negotiations continue. 
 Viacom demanded last month that Google remove more than 100,000 clips of programs it owns like ''The Daily Show With John Stewart'' and ''South Park.'' 
 Google reaffirmed its position that it complies with copyright law that protects Web sites as long as it promptly removes content when asked to do so by the owner. 
 It is widely thought among analysts and media experts that the lawsuit is mostly a negotiating tactic meant to force Google into a licensing agreement. Legal experts are split on the merits of the case. CHARGES DISMISSED -- A judge in California dismissed four felony counts against Patricia C. Dunn, the former chairwoman of Hewlett-Packard. 
 Ms. Dunn and several others had been accused of illicit spying to try to discover the source of leaks of inside company information. 
 The charges against Ms. Dunn were dropped after several weeks of negotiations with California's new state attorney general, Jerry Brown, the former California governor and the former mayor of Oakland. Misdemeanor charges against Kevin T. Hunsaker, a former company lawyer; and two private investigators, Ronald R. DeLia and Matthew DePante, will be dropped after they each perform 96 hours of community service. 
 The private investigators had been accused of ''pretexting'' -- misrepresenting themselves to obtain the phone records of journalists and Hewlett-Packard directors. Ms. Dunn was accused of authorizing that tactic.
 Hewlett-Packard's annual meeting happened to be held this week. Mark V. Hurd, the chairman and chief executive, indicated that he wanted to put the company's legal woes behind it and to focus on the future. BIDDING UP -- The Intercontinental Exchange made a surprise $10 billion bid for the Chicago Board of Trade in an attempt to spoil the board's planned merger with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
 The bid from Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, topped the value of the Chicago exchanges' pending deal by $2 billion. The merger of the two longtime Chicago rivals would create the world's largest market for financial derivatives.
 The offer from ICE, which specializes in trading energy contracts, is an indication that the Board of Trade-Mercantile Exchange merger might not survive regulatory scrutiny, according to analysts and one person close to ICE.
 Analysts also said the Mercantile Exchange might have a hard time topping ICE's offer, but that with so much already invested, it will have little choice but to try.

HEADLINE: Maybe a House Is Now Out of Reach, but There's Always Furniture

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
AS the American housing market boomed in recent years, Americans took billions of dollars out of their homes and used the money to buy other things. When the housing market faltered, an important issue became whether that would drive down other spending, further slowing the economy. 
 So far, the evidence is that retail spending has weakened, but not by nearly as much as it did in the most recent recession, in 2001.
The chart shows the year-over-year change in retail sales, using three-month moving averages to smooth out weather-related volatility.
 The February figures, released this week, show a year-over-year gain of 3.6 percent, far below the 9.6 percent increase posted in the summer of 2005, when the housing boom was in full swing, and even further below the 10.9 percent change in early 2000, just as the technology stock bubble was about to burst.
 The 2001 recession was unusual in that it was largely based on a decline in business spending, while consumer spending weakened but never turned negative year-over-year. 
 Last year, it appeared that a slump in car sales was leading the economy down, but sales at car dealers have stabilized, and the latest figures show sales rising at a low 2.6 percent annual rate.
 Remarkably, the decline in housing so far has not decimated spending in furniture and home furnishing stores, despite the fact that such sales usually rise and fall with home sales figures. They are up 4 percent year-over-year now, and while that is less than half the peak rate of growth, it is well above the lows seen during and after the 2001 recession.
 But if Americans have shown a willingness to keep spending at furniture stores, they have shown less willingness to fix up homes, as reflected in spending at building materials, garden equipment and supply dealers. The latest figure shows a year-over-year decline of 3.2 percent. Just a year ago, spending in those stores was rising at a rate of almost 19 percent a year.
 The No. 1 chain in that category, Home Depot, has noticed the decline in sales, and evidently thinks that the cause is not just the economy. After an article on the MSN Money Web site produced an outpouring of stories of bad customer service from Home Depot customers, Frank Blake, the new chief executive of the company, sent in an apology . ''There's no way I can express how sorry I am for all of the stories you shared,'' he wrote. ''We let you down.'' 
 If the decline in growth of consumer spending continues, more retailers may conclude that they need to change the way they are operating. But so far at least, Americans have been willing and able to keep spending at rates that are not recession-inducing, even if they are far from the boom times of just a year ago.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rose 0.4% in February

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
A rebound in energy prices pushed inflation higher in February, suggesting that a weakening economy has not yet taken much pressure off rising prices, as the Federal Reserve has long hoped, according to government figures released yesterday. 
 The Consumer Price Index rose by 0.4 percent last month, after a 0.2 percent increase in January, the Labor Department said, leaving overall prices 2.4 percent higher than they were a year ago.
''This is not the most comforting news for inflation or for the Fed,'' said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank in Chicago. ''It reminds the Fed that their work to get the price level back under control is not yet done.'' 
 Prices of interest rate futures indicated that the uptick in inflation makes it less likely that the Fed will cut interest rates in coming months, despite the recent turbulence in financial markets -- touched off by the turmoil of some mortgage lenders -- which led some investors to expect lower rates.
 ''Some people looking at the financial markets in the past few weeks were hoping the Fed would soften its tone on inflation,'' said Richard Moody, chief economist at Mission Residential, a real estate investment company. ''I don't see they will have the latitude to change.''
 Much of the rise in inflation was because of a rebound in energy costs after they declined in January. The price of household energy rose 1.4 percent last month, driven by a 1.5 percent increase in piped gas and electricity as cold weather across much of the country forced Americans to keep their heat on. Gasoline at the pump also inched up 0.3 percent, after falling 3 percent in January.
 Other prices also rose. Frosts earlier this year that damaged oranges and other crops contributed to a 4.7 percent gain in fruit and vegetable prices last month and helped lift the overall price of food by 0.8 percent. 
 And a 1.1 percent increase in February in the price of meat, fish and poultry products underscored how the diversion of corn to make ethanol is having an effect on prices further up the food chain by increasing the cost of animal feed.
 The price of clothes also jumped 0.5 percent, and so did medical costs. Indeed, after a 0.8 percent increase in January, medical costs this year have posted their biggest two-month increase since January and February of 1992, suggesting that the moderation of health care costs late last year was more a fluke than the beginning of a trend.
 ''Some of the deceleration in prices that we saw at the end of 2006 is proving to be short-lived,'' said David Greenlaw, chief United States fixed-income economist at Morgan Stanley. ''It's unlikely we will see much of a decline in inflation unless the labor market and the economy show some signs of weakening.''
 Price gains are eating into the budgets of workers, rapidly gobbling up the wage increases that started materializing late last year. For workers outside of management ranks, real weekly earnings declined by 0.3 percent in February for the second consecutive month. Wages are now only 1.5 percent above where they were a year ago.
 Still, with unemployment at 4.5 percent, the labor market is tight. Productivity growth has slowed and unit labor costs have risen, slowing the growth in corporate profits. If workers manage to obtain bigger paychecks to compensate for rising prices of gasoline and other items, they will add pressure to inflation, as businesses will be more likely to respond by raising prices.
 Mr. Greenlaw observed that if the economy continues to grow at about 2 percent, unemployment will rise and inflation will abate, but unless unemployment rises from its current level of 4.5 percent, prices are likely to remain under pressure.
 The higher readings on inflation posit something of a quandary for the Fed. The Fed's interest-rate-setting committee will meet next week. Most economists expect it to leave the short-term rate unchanged, at 5.25 percent. But some economists suggested that the current readings on inflation change the game plan somewhat, underscoring that inflation remains a substantial risk. 
 Most Wall Street economists had anticipated the Fed would start cutting interest rates later this year, as slower growth pushed up unemployment and put a brake on prices. These expectations grew as the turmoil in financial markets increased the risk that economic growth could slow more sharply than expected.
 But higher inflation leaves less room for lower rates. The core Consumer Price Index -- the Fed's preferred price gauge, which excludes volatile food and energy prices -- increased by 0.2 percent in February. This left core prices 2.7 percent higher than in the same month of last year, well in excess of the 1 percent to 2 percent range that the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has said he is comfortable with.
 ''There is a hint that inflation pressures are starting to rise,'' said Kenneth Beauchemin, an economist at Global Insight in Lexington, Mass. ''If we get another couple of months with strong core inflation readings in the range of 2.5 percent, certainly the chances of a rate cut in 2007 will be near zero.''

HEADLINE: In March, More Towns Seem to Love A Parade

BYLINE: By JONATHAN MILLER

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J., March 15 

 BODY:
Department stores start to haul out their Christmas tinsel around Halloween these days, and pumpkin picking starts soon after Labor Day. Now you can add St. Patrick's Day, which, with its accompanying parades, is becoming a matter of Erin go on and on. 
 There is ''the oldest, biggest and best in the world,'' as organizers of the St. Patrick's Day parade in Manhattan advertise it, every March 17, drawing millions of Irish and non-Irish celebrants along Fifth Avenue. 
 But over the past several years a growing number of towns -- from Keyport, N.J., to Sleepy Hollow, N.Y. -- have decided that they, too, should be host to their own processions of bands, dancing troupes and local luminaries. Their celebrations are not necessarily held on March 17; indeed, almost never on March 17.
 Not that the phenomenon is limited to the new sod. London started its St. Patrick's Day parade four years ago, well behind Oslo, where expatriate Irish started one in 2000. Tokyo started its parade in 1992, and Singapore has one, too.
 Niall Gunn, the owner of a pub in Rockville Centre, N.Y., said that St. Patrick's Day was always a laid-back affair in his hometown in County Monaghan, Ireland, but times have changed. 
 ''My local town started a parade five years ago,'' Mr. Gunn said. ''When I was growing up, you went to Mass, had boiled bacon or leg of lamb for dinner, watched some football, and went to bed.''
 The practical effect of all this merry-making is nearly a monthlong celebration of all things St. Patrick. 
 ''It's a gimmick,'' said Michael Shenker, president of the Chamber of Commerce in Rockville Centre, where its first parade began in 1997 and is now one of the biggest on Long Island, attracting 100,000 visitors. 
 Mr. Shenker quickly corrected himself: ''Well, maybe not a gimmick. But anything to help the towns.''
 In New Jersey, 6 of the state's 22 parades did not even exist a half-dozen years ago, but they are now sprinkled throughout the month. This year, Mount Holly held its parade on March 3, Sparta had one last Saturday, Keyport will strut on Sunday and Highlands on March 24. Keansburg, which got the idea after seeing Keyport's inaugural last year, will hold its own celebration on March 31. 
 On Long Island, there were parades in Bay Shore and Blue Point last Sunday. And in Connecticut, Mystic will hold its fourth annual parade on March 25. About a half-dozen other towns -- like Somerville, N.J., and Sleepy Hollow, N.Y. -- started their parades in the mid-to-late 1990s. 
 That's not to mention old standbys like Belmar and Morristown in New Jersey or Montauk on Long Island, which have been around for decades and attract tens of thousands. 
 In Queens, there are two parades, and both were held earlier this month. One, the St. Pat's for All Parade, was started in 2000 in Sunnyside and Woodside after organizers in Manhattan would not allow gay groups to march. The other, the Queens County parade, is in the Rockaways.
 As the parades have proliferated, there has been a common thread. Usually, a contingent of pub owners and residents get together and decide that a town has a worrisome deficit of Irish pride. A committee is formed, money is raised and performers are assembled. 
 Most towns are more than happy to accommodate the festivities. The longtime mayor of Rockville Centre, Eugene J. Murray, who was in on the planning for the town's first parade, said: ''It brings tremendous business into the village for that day. Everyone loves a good party.''
 Call it the snaring of the green.
 Helen Cunning, who started the event in Hoboken in 1986, said the parades-come-lately are part of a distinct American tradition of commercializing holidays. ''It says something about our economy, and how much money we all have,'' said Ms. Cunning, an executive at Hackensack University Medical Center. ''It's the smart marketing of the holy day. There's a reason you're in Lord & Taylor's a week before Halloween and they're already hanging Christmas decorations.''
 Jimmy McTernan, an assistant fire chief in Keyport who helped start his town's parade, said: ''I went to Highlands's first parade and I said, 'Why can't we do this?' Keansburg came to our parade and said, 'Why can't we do this?' '' 
 Organizers point out that many parades donate money to good causes. The founder of the Rockville Centre parade, David Crowe, said that his event usually contributes about $30,000 a year to charity.
 But it is not all hot potato soup and frothy Guinness in a pint.
 In Hoboken, which held its parade on March 3 this year, some politicians and residents have started to chafe at the size of the event -- which draws 30,000 people to the city of 70,000 -- and its wilder side. This year, the city council tried to restrict bars from opening until 11 a.m., instead of the usual 6 a.m. Although that plan failed, many bar owners agreed to open later. 
 ''I've been a councilman for 17 years,'' said Richard Del Boccio, who for the first time in his political career decided to skip the parade in Hoboken and instead go to St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan. ''It just got worse and worse and worse.'' 
 When he returned from the city, Mr. Del Boccio said he watched a man urinating in the street and saw a drunken man harassing a neighbor. ''We should not be captives in our home on that day,'' he said.
 Another Hoboken councilman, Michael Russo, said a metal banister in front of his civic association was ripped out of the concrete that day.
 Still, most towns are pleased with the festivities, and more are looking to start their own parades.
 This month, Mr. Crowe, the founder of the Rockville Centre parade, opened a bar in Babylon. He said he had already been besieged by calls to organize a parade there.
 ''It's been discussed,'' he said, laughing. ''I've been asked about 20 times in the past three days.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 21, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the recent proliferation of St. Patrick's Day parades in the New York region misstated the given name in some copies of the president of the Chamber of Commerce in Rockville Centre, N.Y., which began its parade in 1997. He is Michael Shenker, not Eric. The article also misstated the population of Hoboken, N.J., which held its parade on March 3 this year. It is 39,900, according to a 2005 census estimate -- not 70,000.

HEADLINE: Mr. Shaw Goes to Harlem (and Meets Snoop Dogg)

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
What would George Bernard Shaw think about urban renewal or the United States' current policy toward the poor? Or hip-hop music? Do you care?
 All these questions are raised by the Epic Theater Center's clumsy new production of Shaw's ''Widowers' Houses,'' which gives his work the modernizing treatment that is quite common for plays of Shakespeare and Chekhov. In this case the 1892 drama, adapted by Ron Russell and Godfrey L. Simmons Jr., is updated to Harlem one century later. 
''Widowers' Houses,'' Shaw's first (and far from best) play, follows a young innocent, Dr. Harry Trench (James Wallert), who discovers to his surprise that the father of his wife-to-be, Blanche Sartorius (Rachael Holmes), earned his fortune as an exploitative landlord. This prompts the doctor to tell his fiancee that he won't accept any of her family's money. But love does not conquer all this time, and what happens next is what inspired the critic Eric Bentley to call the play ''the most revolutionary act in modern English drama.''
 The bride balks at giving up her father's money, and when it's discovered that the groom's wealth comes from the same unseemly source, he drops his righteous pose, and the lovebirds return to each other's arms in the kind of happy ending that only a true cynic would enjoy. 
 In this new version the couple's reconciliation comes off as a broad, confusing joke rather than a bitter one, which is typical of this production. Mr. Sartorius (played with a regal bearing by Peter Jay Fernandez) has become a wealthy African-American who owns the Rosa Parks Houses, and Dr. Trench is a white conservative who likes rap music. (This is surely the first Shaw play that quotes Snoop Dogg.) Mr. Russell, who also directed the production, has given us a jaded picture of the members of the new black upper class, who occasionally sound like Victorian Englishmen.
 The script frequently tests the limits of credibility. Can the slumlord's daughter really have no idea about the business that has allowed her to live a life of luxury? And would any New Yorker, even one putting on airs like Trench's friend Mr. Cokane (played by Mr. Simmons), wear a cravat and urge others to be gentlemen?
 While adaptations like these aim to make their material immediate and contemporary, the results more often than not appear oddly distant from real life, an artificial exercise that could emerge only from theaterland.''Widowers' Houses'' plays through April 8 at the Kirk Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200.

HEADLINE: An Upset in the Vanderbilts And a Title in the Mixed Pairs

BYLINE: By Phillip Alder

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, March 16 

 BODY:
At the Spring North American Championships here, the Vanderbilt Knockout Teams semifinals were played on Friday. The No. 4 seed (Lou Ann O'Rourke, Eric Greco, Geoff Hampson, Marc Jacobus, Norberto Bocchi and Giorgio Duboin) faced No. 25 (Piotr Tuszynski, Apolinary Kowalski, Farid Assemi, Nick Bykov, Srikanth Kodayam and Ed Wojewoda). The No. 7 seed (Christal Henner-Welland, Bjorn Fallenius, Roy Welland, Antonio Sementa, Cezary Balicki and Adam Zmudzinski) played No. 3 (James Cayne, Michael Seamon, Fulvio Fantoni, Lorenzo Lauria, Claudio Nunes and Alfredo Versace). 
 The major upset in the quarterfinals was the defeat of the No. 1 seed -- Nick Nickell, Dick Freeman, Bob Hamman, Jeff Meckstroth, Eric Rodwell and Paul Soloway -- by the Tuszynski team. After being down by 31 international match points at halftime, Tuszynski rallied to win by 146 imps to 134.
 The Rockwell Mixed Pairs was won on Wednesday night by Mildred Breed of Austin, Tex., and Richard Zeckhauser of Cambridge, Mass. They entered the last round more than a board behind Jane and Bob Teel of Birmingham, Ala., but scored 76 percent of the 182 match points available in that round to prevail by 2.09 match points.
 The diagramed deal aided their run to the title. But first look only at the North hand. East passes, your partner opens one no-trump, 15-17 points, and West passes. How would you plan the auction?
 It would seem normal to respond two diamonds, a transfer bid showing at least five hearts, then to rebid three diamonds, promising at least four cards in that suit and game-forcing values. But Zeckhauser, an economics professor at Harvard who with Peter H. Schuck has just published a book with the interesting title ''Targeting in Social Programs: Avoiding Bad Bets, Removing Bad Apples,'' decided that he wanted to play in four hearts, even if his partner had only a doubleton in that suit. 
 So he responded four diamonds, a Texas transfer. (Note that three no-trump has no chance after a spade lead, and that six diamonds unluckily fails when the trumps break 4-0. Also, if North had responded two diamonds, East would probably have overcalled two spades. Four spades doubled goes down only two for minus 500.)
 Against four hearts, West led the diamond jack. East, not knowing that South had only two hearts, decided to discard a spade instead of potentially ''wasting'' his natural trump trick and establishing dummy's diamond suit. (If East had ruffed, declarer would have had to guess to drop his heart queen to score an overtrick.)
 Breed, a full-time bridge player, won with her ace and played a heart to dummy's jack. East, after taking his queen, shifted to a spade. Declarer won with her ace, drew trumps and called for the club nine. When East went in with his queen, South ducked, playing a low club from her hand.
 Declarer ruffed East's spade return on the board, led a club to her jack, cashed the club ace, ruffed a club on the board and claimed an overtrick, losing only one heart and one club.
 Plus 650 scored 89 percent of the match points available on the board.

HEADLINE: IRAN IS PLAYING A GROWING ROLE IN IRAQ ECONOMY

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Damien Cave, Alissa J. Rubin and Wisam A. Habeeb contributed reporting from Baghdad, and Yerevan Adham from Halabja, Iraq.

DATELINE: NAJAF, Iraq 

 BODY:
While the Bush administration works to stop Iran from meddling in Iraq, Iranian air-conditioners fill Iraqi appliance stores, Iranian tomatoes ripen on the windowsills of kitchens here and legions of white Iranian-made Peugeots sit in Iraqi driveways.
 Some Iraqi cities, including Basra, the southern oil center, buy or plan to buy electricity from Iran. The Iraqi government relies on Iranian companies to bring gasoline from Turkmenistan to alleviate a severe shortage. Iraqi officials are reviewing an application by Iran to open a branch of an Iranian bank in Baghdad, and Iran has offered to lend Iraq $1 billion.
The economies of Iraq and Iran, the largest Shiite-majority countries in the world, are becoming closely integrated, with Iranian goods flooding Iraqi markets and Iraqi cities looking to Iran for basic services.
 After the two countries fought a devastating war from 1980 to 1988, Saddam Hussein maintained tight control over cross-border trade, but commerce has exploded since the American-led invasion of 2003. 
 Much of the money is heading in one direction, though: Iraq is becoming dependent on imports because industries here have been ravaged by the economic sanctions of the 1990s and the current sectarian violence. Reconstruction and security have lagged so far behind the expectations of ordinary Iraqis that cheap goods from Iran and neighboring countries often provide the only comforts in their lives.
 ''What is happening in Iraq at the moment is a lot of trade, but it's almost all one-way trade,'' Barham Salih, the Iraqi deputy prime minister for finance, said of the country's economic ties with Iran and other neighbors. ''If you take oil away, there's a lot of imbalance in this.''
 Iraqi leaders from the Shiite bloc currently in power say political and economic ties with Iran, which is governed by Shiite Persians, will inevitably strengthen. As driving factors, they cite the hostility of Sunni Arab nations to a Shiite-run Iraq and the ambivalence of the White House toward the devout Shiite parties here.
 ''If the Shiites do not feel protected, if they feel what they've achieved can't be maintained, much of the leadership will have to work with Iran,'' said Sami al-Askari, a Shiite legislator who advises Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, himself a religious Shiite with close ties to Iran. ''The Arabs and the Americans are saying Iran is bad, but it's the only recourse.''
 According to one commonly cited statistic, trade between Iraq and Iran has grown by 30 percent a year since the 2003 invasion. But American officials here say no accurate numbers are available because Iran refuses to release complete figures. 
 Statistics from the American Embassy's economic section show that Syria accounted for 22 percent of Iraq's imports in 2005, and Turkey 21 percent. Iran, which has the longest border with Iraq, would be likely to fall in that range, officials said. The C.I.A. World Factbook estimates Iraq's total imports in 2006 at $20.8 billion.
 Iran has divulged a few trade numbers. Tehran told the government of Iraq's northern Kurdish region that trade with the region amounted to more than $1 billion in 2006, said Hassan Baqi, president of the chamber of commerce in the Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya. 
 Hoshyar Zebari, the Iraqi foreign minister, who is a Kurd, said that provincial governments had been making their own commercial deals with Iranian interests, but that lately he had started ordering them to go through the Foreign Ministry. 
 ''We have a number of agreements with Iran on energy, on trade, on oil, on visitors -- that is, pilgrims -- which is very important to them,'' he said. 
 Here in the Shiite religious heartland in the south, Iraqis have profited handsomely from the new economic ties with Iran. This is particularly noticeable in the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala, where shrines draw Iranian pilgrims by the thousands each month.
 The headquarters here of revered Shiite clerics like Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani collect enormous dues from satellite offices in Iran. That money, too, ends up in the local economy.
 The Iranian government gives Najaf $20 million a year to build and improve tourist facilities for pilgrims, said Asaad Abu Galal, the governor of Najaf. Mr. Abu Galal, a member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, an influential Iraqi political party founded in Iran, said Karbala got roughly $3 million a year. In addition, each Iranian pilgrim spends up to $1,000 on hotels, food and souvenirs. 
 Provincial tourism officials estimate that more than 22,000 Iranian pilgrims visit Najaf each month and that at least 10,000 travel to Karbala. Most come on package tours. 
 Officials would like to see more, but they say many are being held back by visa restrictions and security concerns. ''We must increase the number of pilgrims,'' Mr. Abu Galal said.
 The close ties with Iran in the south have drawn scrutiny from the United States, Iraqi officials say. At one point, Najaf Province came close to hiring an Iranian company to build an airport, but the deal was scuttled at the last minute by the Transportation Ministry in Baghdad, officials with the Supreme Council said. They suspect the United States of putting pressure on the ministry.
 ''The Americans don't want to bring Iranians to Najaf,'' Mr. Abu Galal said. ''The Americans want to control the sky.''
 A senior American official in Baghdad declined to comment specifically on the Najaf airport project, but said the Americans did look carefully at major business exchanges with Iran. ''We pay a lot of attention,'' he said. ''We don't want people working for the intelligence services to get contracts for projects here in Iraq.''
 Tensions between the United States and Iran have increased tremendously in recent months. The White House, saying Iran wants to develop nuclear weapons, has urged the United Nations to impose harsh sanctions. It has also accused Iran of exporting deadly explosives to Shiite militias in Iraq. 
 But the senior American official said the growth in trade between Iraq and Iran was generally positive. ''I wouldn't link the rise in trade with Iran with Iranian political influence,'' said the official, who requested anonymity, following diplomatic protocol. ''As long as this is normal economic activity that doesn't have security implications, it's a good step.''
 Speaking of Iraq's Shiite leaders, he added: ''I think there's a little bit of a tendency for them to want to deal with Iran. For many of these individuals Iran is more or less a frame of reference. I think that's something we have to accept.''
 Border cities have turned to Iran to help alleviate chronic electricity shortages. If construction on transmission wires is finished by the summer, Basra, the country's second-largest city, will soon have the capacity to draw 250 megawatts of power from Iran at 5.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, said Karim Wahid, the Iraqi electricity minister.
 Diyala Province, which borders Iran east and north of Baghdad, already imports 120 megawatts at 5.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, he said.
 Halabja, a Kurdish city, has spent $1.8 million to develop the infrastructure to import electricity from Iran but has not begun receiving power, Kurdish officials say. 
 Iranian goods have proliferated throughout Iraq. White Peugeot sedans that began rolling out of Iranian factories in 2005 are sold everywhere in Iraq. In the far south, Basra imports $45 million worth of goods from Iran each year, includingitems as varied as carpets, construction materials, fish and spices, said Muhammad al-Waeli, the governor of Basra Province. Each day, 100 to 150 commercial trucks drive from Iran to Iraq at the nearby Shalamcha border crossing. 
 In downtown Baghdad, piles of Iranian air-conditioners with brand names like Sona, Jayan and Aysan Khazar sit next to Chinese television sets on sidewalks outside appliance stores. 
 The blue-and-white air-conditioners use a water-cooling technology and can run on generator power, making them popular with electricity-starved Iraqis. They cost $60 to $140 and came on the market only after the fall of Mr. Hussein.
 Mahmoud Abu Amir, the owner of a shop called Diamond of the Gulf, sat at his desk sipping chai, a spiced tea, one afternoon as men unloaded Iranian air-conditioners from a truck. Mr. Abu Amir said he had more than 2,000 in stock. ''The transportation fees from Iran are much cheaper than from, say, China,'' he said. 
 Books published in Iran now fill the shelves of bookshops across Iraq. The books are cheap because the Iranian government subsidizes printing costs by up to 60 percent, said Safaa Dawood Salman, the owner of a cramped bookshop on Baghdad's famous Mutanabi Street, which was devastated by a suicide car bombing on March 5. 
 ''The books are cheaper than before,'' said Shayma Said, 29, as she handed over a 10,000-dinar note -- about $8 -- to Mr. Salman to pay for a hardcover Iranian-printed book on the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. ''I want to buy the three other books in this collection when I save up enough money.'' 
 Facing a severe shortage of doctors, because so many have fled the country, Iraqis increasingly look to Iran for medical care. Iraqis run hotels in Tehran for incoming patients, and Iraqis able to speak Persian offer their services as translators for $5 a day.
 A resident of Baghdad named Afrah said her mother had been going blind, so the family packed and flew to Tehran, where her mother had surgery to mend her badly damaged retina. Afrah received medical treatment for her own eye problems.
 Afterward, they made a pilgrimage to Qum, a Shiite holy city. The monthlong trip to Iran cost the family $6,000.
 ''We have friends who went there and had successful operations, and that encouraged us to go there,'' said Afrah, 47, allowing only her first name to be printed because of security concerns. ''We were very comfortable. There were so many Iraqis there.''

HEADLINE: Iran's President Vows to Keep Nuclear Project

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, March 16 

 BODY:
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad vowed Friday that Iran would never dismantle its nuclear program, even in the face of toughened sanctions from the United Nations Security Council. 
 In a speech in the city of Tabas, he repeated Iran's oft-stated position that it was entitled under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to pursue a peaceful nuclear program. ''The Iranian people insist on their right,'' the ISNA news agency reported him as saying. 
Addressing himself to the members of the United Nations Security Council, he warned, ''If you want to preserve your dignity in the international community you should change your behavior, because it will increase the revolutionary anger of the Iranian nation.'' 
 Germany and the five permanent members of the Security Council -- Britain, France, China, Russia and the United States -- agreed Thursday to a draft resolution that, if adopted by the Security Council, would impose tougher sanctions on Iran for its refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment program. 
 The United States and some Western governments accuse Iran of pursuing a secret weapons program, but Iran contends that it is merely producing fuel for nuclear reactors. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad has asked to take part in a Security Council meeting to defend Iran's right to its uranium enrichment program, and the United States State Department said Friday that it would act quickly to accommodate the request. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad said in his speech in Tabas, a remote desert city in north-central Iran, that the five permanent members of the Security Council were worried more about Iran's economic progress than about any nuclear threat.
 ''They have never been worried about bombs or weapons because there are many countries that have nuclear warehouses,'' he said. ''The reality is that they are afraid of the progress of our nations,'' he added. 
 In London, Iran's ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency criticized Britain's plans to renew its submarine-based nuclear arsenal while it is asking Iran and North Korea to give up their nuclear programs.
 ''Britain does not have the right to question others when they are not complying with their obligations'' under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, said the ambassador, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Reuters reported.
 ''It is very unfortunate that the U.K., which is always calling for nonproliferation, not only has not given up the weapons but has taken a serious step towards further development of nuclear weapons,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Trade and the Home Front

 BODY:
In a speech just before his recent Asia trip, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. cited a poll showing that only a third of Americans view free trade as an economic plus, while nearly half say it is bad for jobs and wages. Unless Mr. Paulson and the administration do a lot more to counter that public anxiety -- and growing opposition on Capitol Hill -- President Bush stands to lose his fast-track authority to negotiate trade deals, which will be up for renewal soon, and will find it increasingly hard to block protectionist laws. 
 So far Mr. Paulson has tried to explain away Americans' fears by stressing that technology, not trade, is most to blame for lost jobs. But the opposition is not only about lost jobs. It's also about the downward pressure on wages and the concentration of income at the top that have gone hand in hand with globalization. And it's about the erosion of the social safety net -- from inadequate unemployment compensation to subpar public schools -- which makes many Americans view economic transitions like globalization as risks not worth taking.
As the nation's top economic official, Mr. Paulson should be the person to push for policies to strengthen the political foundation for free trade. That would start with a significant upgrading of the Labor Department's Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which helps workers who lose jobs because of trade. Congress expanded the program in 2002 in exchange for granting Mr. Bush fast-track negotiating authority on trade deals. But the administration has made little effort to publicize the program, and many eligible workers do not even know it exists. 
 Also long overdue is a plan to guarantee all Americans health care. Education is also important, although Mr. Paulson is overstating the case when he describes it as a silver bullet for making Americans more competitive. Unfortunately, the administration has let the funds decline for proven programs like Head Start and has even failed to secure full financing for its No Child Left Behind initiative. 
 In the wake of Mr. Paulson's trip to China, Beijing made another comment about liberalizing its currency exchange rate, a move that would help make American exports more competitive. But the greatest threats to free trade are Americans' fears about globalization and their doubts that the government will do anything to help them. It's time for Mr. Paulson to use his powers of persuasion -- starting with Mr. Bush -- to solve the domestic side of the trade problem.

HEADLINE: International Support Is Sought at U.N. for Iraq Rebuilding Plan

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 16 

 BODY:
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon appealed Friday for international support for Iraq at a ceremony here to introduce a five-year reconstruction plan for the country.
 Noting that ''the challenges ahead are immense,'' Mr. Ban told delegates from 87 countries and eight regional groups, ''I am sure you will agree that we cannot leave Iraq on its own to cope with them.'' 
 Vice President Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq presented the plan in a 33-page document called the International Compact with Iraq. The compact, drafted by the Iraqi government and the United Nations, creates a framework for international aid to Iraq.
 At the same time, to reassure potential donors, it sets up targets for overhauling the government over the next five years, including establishing an effective justice system, building a credible civil service, guaranteeing human rights, improving security forces, disbanding militias, increasing oil revenues and improving financial management.
 After the meeting, Robert M. Kimmitt, the United States deputy treasury secretary, said: ''The Iraqis have done their part. The question now is, what will the international community do?''
 Bush administration officials often criticized the United Nations in 2004 and 2005 for not involving itself more deeply in rebuilding Iraq. But in an interview, Mr. Kimmitt praised the organization for taking an active role in the new development plan.
 ''The engagement of the United Nations in the compact process has been absolutely essential to its success and absolutely essential to being where we are today,'' he said.
 Mr. Kimmitt was also asked about the presence in the hall of ambassadors from Iran and Syria, countries that the Bush administration has accused of meddling in Iraq. He said, ''Our view is that any country that wants to contribute positively to the success of the democratic, market-based transition in Iraq is welcome to attend these sessions and lay out their plans for doing so.'' 
 He said that the event on Friday was not a donor conference, but that countries would be invited to a ceremony next month at which they would be asked to make money pledges to begin realizing the reconstruction plan. He added that the Iraqi government had proved in its dealings with the International Monetary Fund and in its success in drafting an oil revenue-sharing law that it could meet benchmarks.
 Asked how the plan could move forward in Iraq under current conditions, Mr. Kimmitt said: ''In this business, you don't do things sequentially. You have to do it in a coordinated fashion.''
 He added: ''I think the new term now is 'clear, secure and build.' We have to make sure that clear, secure and build are all in the same room discussing coordinated action so that once an area becomes secure, as some areas of Iraq are, we can move very quickly to provide the economic reconstruction that they need.''

HEADLINE: Ex-Counsel Is Thrust Back Into Politics by Inquiry on Prosecutors

BYLINE: By LYNETTE CLEMETSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16 

 BODY:
By all accounts, Harriet E. Miers was delighted to be back in Dallas. It was Valentine's Day. She had been unemployed for little more than two weeks, and when she met a friend, Jerry K. Clements, for lunch at an elegant Uptown neighborhood restaurant, Ms. Miers looked happier and more rested, Ms. Clements said, than she had in years.
 Having been forced out of her job as White House legal counsel and having had her competence questioned, Ms. Miers deflected all talk of work. Instead she spent the meal asking about old friends, speaking of her desire to be with family again and longing for a return to a regular supply of authentic Tex-Mex food. 
''She was very upbeat, very positive,'' said Ms. Clements, a managing partner at Locke Liddell & Sapp, the Dallas law firm where Ms. Miers once worked. ''But she made it clear that this was just a girls chitchat kind of lunch, that she needed time to rest and just decompress.''
 The respite from Washington was short-lived. The disclosure this week of e-mail messages sent in 2005 and 2006 between Ms. Miers and a top aide in the Justice Department regarding the dismissal of seven federal prosecutors last December placed her at the center of the investigation into the White House's role in the removals. 
 As former colleagues and fellow Bush loyalists point fingers of blame in her direction, Ms. Miers faces a forced return to the bruising political circles that, in her last years in the administration, excoriated her for everything from her intellect to her eye shadow. 
 Ms. Miers, who has commuted between Washington and Dallas since her resignation in January, has not commented on the investigation, and declined to be interviewed. The Senate Judiciary Committee has postponed for a week a vote on whether to subpoena her to testify. 
 But several administration officials, including Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, have said she originated the idea of the dismissals. They continued to shift accountability to her even as additional e-mail messages, released on Thursday, indicated that Karl Rove, the president's senior adviser, discussed the dismissals with Mr. Gonzales before Mr. Gonzales became attorney general and Ms. Miers replaced him as the president's legal counsel. 
 In Dallas, friends have rallied to her defense.
 ''There's a feeling among the people who know her in Texas that she is once again involved in the political side of Washington, D.C., and that it is unfair treatment for a person who gave up a good life to serve the administration,'' Ms. Clements said. ''From afar, Washington seems like a very nasty place to be.''
 Over the years, fellow Republicans have been some of Ms. Miers's harshest critics. President Bush nominated her to the Supreme Court in October 2005, but after weeks of scornful attacks from conservatives who said she lacked the intellect and experience for the appointment, she withdrew her name from consideration. 
 After Democrats won control of Congress last year, Joshua B. Bolten, the president's chief of staff, decided Ms. Miers must be replaced as legal counsel, suggesting that she was not the right person to steer the White House through an anticipated flurry of investigations. 
 Republicans close to the White House have said that Mr. Bolten and others in the administration had wanted to replace Ms. Miers earlier than January, but were rebuffed by President Bush, who considers her a close friend and loyal adviser. 
 Through it all Ms. Miers remained discreet and outwardly unruffled.
 ''I've had an incredible opportunity to serve the nation, to serve the American people,'' she said in a brief telephone interview before her departure in January. 
 Friends said they expected no change in her demeanor.
 ''Harriet is the picture of grace and composure,'' said Rena Pederson, a longtime friend of Ms. Miers, now working as a speechwriter at the State Department for Karen P. Hughes, another Texan and former adviser to the president. ''I haven't talked to her about what is going on now, but if she were going through any difficulties, she wouldn't show it.''
 Ms. Hughes, also a close friend of Ms. Miers and a member of Mr. Bush's inner circle from Texas, said she last saw Ms. Miers in January at a fun-filled dinner for Ms. Hughes's 50th birthday at Cactus Cantina, a Mexican restaurant in Northwest Washington. Condoleezza Rice and Laura Bush were also among the small group of friends who attended. 
 Ms. Hughes said she felt confident that Ms. Miers would weather the current controversy.
 ''I think the world of Harriet Miers,'' Ms. Hughes said. ''She is a strong and gracious person. She is so hardworking and has such a strong foundation of faith, that I am confident that whatever she decides to do, she will be incredibly effective.''
 After her departure from the White House, Ms. Miers kept mum about any plans. There was talk that she might be tapped to run Mr. Bush's library if it is housed at Southern Methodist University, her alma mater. Former colleagues at Locke Liddell & Sapp floated invitations for her to return. 
 Ms. Miers has spent most of her time the past couple of months catching up with her siblings and visiting her mother, Sally Miers, who is in her 90s, struggling with dementia and living in an assisted-living complex in Dallas. 
 In late January, as Ms. Miers prepared to leave the White House after six years, the president and Mrs. Bush held a going away party for her at Blair House, the official state guest house for presidents. The send-off was just one of many, after a round of personnel changes in the West Wing the previous year. But it seemed to hit the president a bit harder than other transitions, said some who attended. 
 Though there were roughly 200 people present, the president's remarks, some said, seemed more like private words to a friend than public praise of an employee. With Mrs. Bush close by, he told Ms. Miers in an emotional voice that she had been a part of his family for years and that they would always be friends. The two exchanged a warm hug as she prepared to leave the struggles of the White House behind.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Aim to Curb Loan Abuses

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16 

 BODY:
Senior Democrats in Congress, worried that the rising number of homeowners who cannot repay their mortgages could cause broader economic problems, have begun drafting legislation to curtail predatory lending practices.
 The provisions include requiring mortgage lenders to determine if borrowers have the financial ability to repay loans and making issuers and buyers of predatory mortgages more legally accountable.
The legislation still faces significant political obstacles, including opposition from a well-financed, well-connected industry. But proponents of the measures have significant political momentum, as defaults continue to rise and the markets are roiled by failing mortgage companies. 
 Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee, said in an interview on Friday that he intended to move legislation in the coming weeks. He said the measure he was preparing would discourage abusive loans by imposing legal liability ''up the chain.'' It would give borrowers and others the ability to sue the Wall Street firms that package those mortgages and then sell them as mortgage-backed securities, as well as the purchasers of those securities in the secondary market.
 ''Anybody, including the original borrower, can make a claim, and the liability would go up the chain,'' he said. ''People say it may discourage certain kinds of lending. But that's precisely what we want to do. We will pass a bill that won't allow companies to loan people more money than they can pay back or loans for more than the value of the house.''
 Mr. Frank said he expected the committee would approve the legislation in the spring. His counterpart in the Senate, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview on Friday that he was also considering a legislative approach, although his preference was to first see if the problems could be resolved through a more aggressive response by regulators. 
 ''I have two public policy goals,'' said Mr. Dodd, who is a presidential candidate. ''One is to make sure that what's been going on stops. That is the easier of the two issues to address. And the second is what can we do to keep people in these homes. What if anything can be done to prevent flooding the market with these delinquencies.''
 Recent testimony before Mr. Dodd's banking committee by one housing expert, Martin Eakes of the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonpartisan research organization, indicated that more than two million families would lose their homes to foreclosures that could have been avoided through better lending practices.
 ''I'm not averse to legislating on it,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''My preference is to see whether it could be better managed by the regulators knowing that legislation can be so difficult to get through.''
 For years, Mr. Frank and other House Democrats have unsuccessfully sought legislation to curtail predatory lending practices. But with Democrats now in control of Congress, and at a time of increasing defaults and problems at several large lending institutions, the supporters of legislation are hoping that their bills will finally gain traction.
 House and Senate committees have announced a series of hearings beginning next week on predatory lending and problems in the subprime market. The House-Senate Joint Economic Committee, led by Senator Charles E. Schumer, is preparing a report that examines the effect of defaults and subprime lending on housing values and the economic security of families.
 ''While no one is sure of the systemic risk,'' Mr. Schumer said, ''there is a growing consensus that there's too great a risk for the people who are getting these loans, and there is a pretty strong consensus that the brakes have to be put on this kind of lending.'' He predicted that the Senate would approve legislation in the next six months.
 Industry executives are hoping that a series of steps taken by the bank regulatory agencies will relieve the pressure on Congress to act.
 This month, federal bank regulators issued a proposed policy statement instructing lenders that make adjustable-rate mortgages to people with weak, or subprime, credit, to consider the ability of the borrowers to pay back the loans in full, and not just whether they can make initial low payments. They also told the mortgage companies to verify the income of borrowers and to be clear in describing the risks of loans. 
 Concerned about the prospects for new laws that will make it harder to issue loans, industry officials have urged the lawmakers to move cautiously. They have said that any overly burdensome new requirements on the lending companies will roil markets by tightening credit for those most in need.
 ''There is always a danger of Congressional overreaction,'' said Kurt Pfotenhauer, a senior vice president and the top lobbyist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. ''I expect we will get a spate of what I consider symbolic legislation. Lawmakers want to go on record for or against something. The main event will be when the committee staff at the direction of the chairman begins to mark up legislation. And every time a presidential candidate gets up and speaks on the issue, it increase the chances we will get legislation this year.''
 In addition to Mr. Dodd, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, a New York Democrat who is running for president, has expressed concerns about the growing rate of loan defaults.
 ''The fact that the entire home mortgage market has such a high rate of foreclosures should be an alarm bell,'' Mrs. Clinton said in an interview on Bloomberg Television on Thursday.
 Mr. Pfotenhauer said that the industry would support legislation that set uniform standards and preempted more stringent state laws. He criticized a proposal to set new liability standards that could be used against the holders of mortgage-backed securities, saying it would promote a wave of new litigation.
 ''Any time there is a foreclosure you can end up in the courts litigating these things,'' he said.

HEADLINE: What We See in Hugo Chavez

BYLINE: By Luisa Valenzuela. 
Luisa Valenzuela is the author of ''Black Novel With Argentines'' and ''The Lizard's Tail.'' This article was translated by Esther Allen from the Spanish.

DATELINE: Buenos Aires 

 BODY:
THE fervent welcome that greeted President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela during his visit to Argentina a week ago was inexplicable to some Argentines and left others indignant. Many here tend to mistrust populism and demagoguery, finding them redolent of Peronism. But even among the wary, a window of hope has opened, with Mr. Chavez as its symbol.
 A lot of water has passed under the bridge since Juan Peron's time. And it was the expansive waters of our own broad river that defined the vectors of force last weekend. For once, the tensions in the American hemisphere flowed on an east-west axis along the Rio de la Plata -- which means ''River of Silver'' and by extension, very appropriately in this case, ''River of Money.'' 
The struggle was about energy, both concrete and metaphorical, and equally combustible in both forms. Across the river in Uruguay's capital, Montevideo, the presence of President George W. Bush caused red-hot passions to flare, along with sizable protests like those he faced in Brazil. In Buenos Aires, my city, on the opposite bank of that river of money, red abounded as well, though in our case it had a very different connotation. Red was the color of President Chavez's jacket and of many of the flags brought by the masses who flooded into a stadium to hear the president of Venezuela speak. 
 Unlike the homogenous rallies of Peronist times, the 30,000 people in this crowd came from very diverse backgrounds. In Argentina, the economic crisis of December 2001 significantly altered not only our social dynamic but our semantics. We no longer talk about the ''pueblo'' -- which means town or village as well as people. Now we talk about the ''gente,'' which also means people, but with a different nuance, derived as it is from the Latin gens meaning race, clan or breed.
 The new vocabulary transcends distinctions of class: the middle classes have now merged with the poor to demand their rights. Hence many students and professionals were in attendance that day, not necessarily attracted by the figure of President Chavez himself so much as by the anti-imperialist opportunity he symbolized. We Argentines, who once imagined ourselves more sophisticated, or more European, than the citizens of neighboring states, were brought closer to the rest of the continent by our impoverishment, and we find ourselves more open to the idea of pan-Latin American solidarity.
 Perhaps last week's crowd also recognized the part that President Chavez's monetary aid played in our recuperation of that illusion known as ''national identity.'' For Argentina had virtually disappeared as an autonomous country during the presidency of Carlos Menem from 1989 to 1999, the era of our ''carnal relations'' with the United States, which took the form of spurious privatizations and a fictitious exchange rate. 
 While many in Argentina would, nevertheless, not hesitate to call the Venezuelan president a clown or a madman, it's worth keeping in mind that a very heady dose of megalomania is a prerequisite for even dreaming of confronting a rival as overwhelmingly powerful as the United States -- which is also led by a president viewed, in many quarters, as a clown and a madman.
 President Chavez's weapons of seduction are his superabundance of petrodollars and his obsession with a shared Latin American project. His plan is to realize the dream of Simon Bolivar, the old utopian vision of Latin American integration that today seems more viable than ever before. 
 It may be that President Bush chose to venture into these forgotten Southern latitudes to counter that vision. In Brazil, he tried to draw attention to the production of ethanol, an ecologically correct rival to petroleum that nonetheless depletes the earth. And in Uruguay, all Mr. Bush seemed to be trying to do was irritate the other governments of South America by promoting a Free Trade Area of the Americas project in opposition to Mercosur, the southern common market formed in 1991 by Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and, somewhat later, Venezuela.
 These things sometimes backfire. President Bush found himself repudiated on one bank of the Plata while President Chavez was getting ovations on the opposite one: each contender in his corner and the moral triumph to the last man left standing, as in a boxing ring.
 Some Argentines severely criticized President Nestor Kirchner for providing his Venezuelan counterpart with such a platform, complaining that President Chavez bought and paid for his visit by showering Argentina with dollars and benefits. Not so. The bargain seems fair -- oil in exchange for agricultural technology and experts -- and since he came to power, President Kirchner has made his country the platform for several other presidents from the Americas: Fidel Castro, Michelle Bachelet, Evo Morales and President Chavez himself, on previous occasions.
 Two major Argentine characteristics are in play here: intrinsic distrust and the need for immediate gratification. Mr. Chavez awakens both of these inclinations, and it's interesting to see them balance each other out. The dream of a single-currency Latin American Union, modeled on the European Union, to create, insofar as possible, a buffer against the hegemony of the United States no longer seems so impossible.
 I'm no political analyst; I have delved into politics only as a fiction writer. But I'm an optimist by nature, and the feeling of empowerment that President Chavez instills, and that various South American governments are endorsing, strikes me as a good engine for further progress -- a means of upgrading ourselves from the status of someone's backyard into that of a truly autonomous region, beyond Mr. Chavez, Mr. Bush and every other form of demagoguery.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Abandons Bank Plans

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Few efforts illustrate the breadth of Wal-Mart's ambitions -- and the fears that they at times generate -- as much as a nearly decade-long drive to establish its own bank.
 Yesterday, Wal-Mart Stores abruptly abandoned those plans for its own bank, withdrawing its application to obtain a special banking charter after a firestorm of criticism from lawmakers, banking industry officials and watchdog groups.
Yet the company, the world's largest retailer, also said that it was not pulling back from plans to roll out a stream of new financial products, which could include mortgages and other types of consumer loans. 
 ''We don't plan to do this again,'' said Jane Thompson, Wal-Mart's president for financial services. ''The bank is behind us. We will use our partners to roll out new products.''
 Wal-Mart's latest banking bid, made in July 2005, had been stalled after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced in late January that it would delay reviewing applications for so-called industrial loan corporations. And a move in Congress to bar nonfinancial companies like retailers from owning banks has been gathering steam. 
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and a co-sponsor of a bill that would prevent Wal-Mart from operating an industrial bank, said that Wal-Mart's withdrawal ''doesn't remove the need for a bill,'' but he conceded that it might ''dial down the temperature'' for passage in the Senate.
 The opposition to Wal-Mart's application had initially come from bankers, who had feared that Wal-Mart would eventually open traditional consumer banks that accept deposits and dispense loans. Such a move, they argued, could wipe out small community banks and hurt profits at bigger ones, given Wal-Mart's huge economic might and record of vanquishing rival retailers. 
 Wal-Mart insisted that it was not interested in running a retail bank, but saw obtaining a banking charter as a way to save money by internally processing credit and debit card transactions. Other nonfinancial companies -- including Target and General Motors -- had already received approval to operate industrial banks.
 But its opponents said that Wal-Mart could not be trusted. The banking application soon escalated into an issue well beyond financial circles, becoming a political flashpoint among longstanding critics and a referendum on the company itself. 
 In an interview yesterday, Ms. Thompson said that Wal-Mart made the decision to withdraw the bank application late last week after seeking approval from H. Lee Scott, the company's chairman and chief executive. Wal-Mart determined that it could pursue other ways to achieve cost-savings and offer its customers more financial products without the glare of the national spotlight. The uncertainty surrounding the F.D.I.C.'s moratorium, which meant that the application could not be approved until next January, also contributed to the decision.
 Wal-Mart's announcement came as a surprise to many on Capitol Hill. Next week, the House Committee on Financial Services is scheduled to hold hearings on a proposed bill that would close the remaining loopholes that allow nonfinancial institutions to operate an industrial bank and prevent existing ones from expanding. It is sponsored by Mr. Frank, the committee's chairman, and Representative Paul E. Gillmor, an Ohio Republican. 
 ''Wal-Mart is the proverbial red blanket in front of the bull,'' said Bert Ely, a banking consultant. ''The blanket has now been pulled away, and I am not sure how much force there is to get this through Congress.''
 While there still appears to be strong support in the House, its chances for Senate approval are less clear. Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement yesterday that he intended to continue examining the issue.
 But Senator Robert F. Bennett, an influential Republican committee member from Utah, where many industrial banks are based, said in a statement that he would continue his effort to preserve the granting of industrial bank charters.
 The F.D.I.C., said Sheila C. Bair, its chairwoman, would wait for Congress to weigh in on whether commercial entities should own industrial banks.
 While the fate of any new laws is being closely watched throughout the banking industry, its most immediate effect could be on Home Depot and eight other commercial entities that have industrial bank charters pending regulatory approval. 
 For Wal-Mart, the company's decision to withdraw its application is the strongest evidence to date that the retailer's public relation's troubles are restricting its ability to grow, something that company executives are reluctant to acknowledge.
 ''This is the fourth time they have struck out since 1998 in trying to get into the deposit-taking business,'' Mr. Ely said. ''They clearly could have played the game better.''
 Earlier this week, Wal-Mart's credibility was again questioned. On Thursday, Mr. Gillmor, the Ohio representative, released a leaked e-mail document that he said was evidence that the retailer's motives extended far deeper into banking than it previously disclosed.
 Ms. Thompson, the Wal-Mart executive, called it a ''manufactured controversy'' and said that the company's decision to withdraw its application yesterday was ''just a coincidence.'' Ms. Thompson played down the effect that the withdrawal of the banking application would have on Wal-Mart's business, suggesting that it had captured a substantial part of the cost-savings they had hoped for as credit and debit card processing fees have declined over time.
 And she vowed that the retailer would expand its financial offerings in the first half of this year. It currently offers check cashing, a branded credit card and a limited number of other financial services. She declined to elaborate on what products Wal-Mart would offer through third-party partnerships, but also did not rule out making loans. 
 ''As far as lending per se,'' she said, ''all I can say is that we are looking for all the needs of our customers.''

SURVEILLANCE
 By Jonathan Raban.
 258 pp. Pantheon Books. $24.
To whom shall we entrust the rendering of this moment and its attendant verities -- the artist or the correspondent, the purveyors of fictions or the gatherers of facts? And who gets to play gatekeeper in this game? The question, both plot device and intellectual premise, animates ''Surveillance,'' the gripping new novel by Jonathan Raban, a British writer who for years has embedded himself in America, earning acclaim for his fresh-eyed travelogues and journalism. 
 Once upon a time the question could be swatted away -- you're talking apples and oranges -- but not anymore. Boundaries have corroded, shapes blurred, genres intermarried. Fabrications are as efficacious as facts. 
 When we read the Times Op-Ed columnist Bob Herbert on anger -- ''The anger quotient is much too low,'' he wrote recently, addressing the political mood in the country -- and then Raban's observations on the same subject, we find ourselves at the center of a murky debate about the current status of fiction versus nonfiction that occupies much of the thematic space in Raban's novel. ''Tad was angry,'' Raban writes. Tad Zachary is a 50ish, gay, H.I.V.-positive, professional actor in Seattle. ''He was angry with himself, angry with the presidency, angry with the nation, angry with the century. That much was rational, justifiable. ... Decent people now were angry people, and what America needed at this low moment in its history was more anger, not less.'' Tad, however, doesn't seek ''to rescue the administration from its folly: he wanted to see it blown to atomic dust or drowned in a sack.'' Here, at least, the anger quotient, considerably more heated than congressional oversight hearings on the Iraq war, is much too high. +
 At the place where Herbert and Raban intersect, do their words complement or cancel one another out, enhance or diminish the force of Herbert's analysis or Raban's make-believe? This is precisely the sort of human algebra that Raban bends his characters around throughout the book, to fascinating yet irresolute effect. Opinions appear to converge on a single truth, but each character has read the thermometer differently, the disparity in this case perhaps explained by the fact that ''Surveillance'' leans out from today's headlines to sniff at a horizon that is within walking distance, a Seattle that might not be 2007 yet edges no further into the calendar than 2008. An overly familiar America, accurately portrayed and perforce underimagined. What's new? One hardly needs a crystal ball: national identity cards, stone-faced soldiers manning checkpoints, an economy in the pits, intensified global warming. Bush still seems to be president, the nation remains divided, Iraq is Iraq. There have been no new terrorist attacks upon the homeland, although extravagant stagings of emergency and disaster drills, spiffed up with actors like Tad, are disruptively common. 
 The drama at hand is mostly atmospheric, the texture of society itself, the quotidian pressures inflated by a ubiquitous sense of dread for what might one day wake us up -- not from the nightmare but into the nightmare. Yet the lives Raban zeroes in on are essentially stable, comfortable, urban middle-class or nouveau riche, their profiles instantly recognizable as our own in the cultural mirror. 
 Tad, the eternally aggrieved leftist, cherishes the one good, sane thing in his life -- the postmodern family he has created with the tenants across the hall, Lucy Bengstrom and her 11-year-old daughter, Alida, in their slightly seedy downtown apartment building. Over the years he has become Alida's surrogate father and Lucy's platonic lover and domestic task-sharer. Lucy, an overweight, boomer-aged single mom and a ''model bourgeois liberal'' who believes in neither evil nor certitude, is a freelance writer for A-list magazines (Tina Brown kept her on a monthly retainer in the '90s) although the assignments have dwindled sufficiently of late for her to be grateful when she gets a timely call from GQ asking her to track down the reclusive literary sensation of the season, a retired history professor named August Vanags, who lives on an island in Puget Sound. Vanags, who claims to have been born in Latvia on the eve of World War II, has written a best-selling memoir (yes, Spielberg's making the movie) about his childhood, which included time in both Hitler's and Stalin's camps. He is one of two immigrants who bookend ''Surveillance'' -- the second is a ruthlessly ambitious Chinese landlord -- and their true identities remain uncertain throughout the narrative. 
 What happens then among these five is a replay of the polarized polemics any sentient citizen has been exposed to throughout the past six years. Vanags, a former Kissinger aide during the Nixon administration, is a charming but unrepentant neocon who seems to be channeling Charles Krauthammer; Tad is to the diatribe born. The savantish 11-year-old interjects naive, untested idealism; the landlord provides the rapacious entrepreneurial spirit that vacuums capitalism clean of conscience. Agnostic, skeptical Lucy listens and referees. She is a watcher who, like the author himself, has placed us all under benign surveillance and, given the conflicting evidence, is understandably reluctant to draw conclusions.
 Which returns us to the tricky question ''Surveillance'' forces upon its readers: In the courtroom of history, who gets to testify as a credible witness? Bush is the author of his own legacy, certainly, but how do we sort out his narrative from the one we ourselves create as a nation, especially in light of those among us who falsify, spin or otherwise revise to suit agendas that spawn parallel realities?
 There's plenty of talk in ''Surveillance'' about who reads what and why. Vanags distrusts The New York Times and favors The Wall Street Journal. Tad listens to Al-Jazeera and scours the European press for the ''real'' story. Alida hates fantasies but loves Agatha Christie. The Chinese landlord, contemptuous of novels, gulps down books about Sam Walton. For Lucy, the writer, the more alien the world she reads about, the happier she is.
 We might assume then that she'd be unhappy reading ''Surveillance,'' which is a bit like reality TV, both authentic and artificial. One begins to wonder, as I believe the author intends us to, if the contemporary moment is not ''better'' delivered by the news cycle and the unceasing slosh of cyberflotsam and citizen-journalists with videophones than by literature. The very relevance of ''Surveillance'' to the present moment, in a culture where nearly every surface is hyper-reflective, threatens to amplify the noise and weariness of the day and, paradoxically, actually drown the novel's own relevance out. 
 To his credit, Raban seems to understand the gamble and make the most of it, though not without an occasional misstep -- most noticeably the tendency of characters to stagger beneath the metaphorical load. What the book offers in its auditing of the national dialogue contains no surprises. The talking heads talk. The characters also bloom into their bodies, lives and loves. The insufferable weather turns nostalgically clement. We look in the mirror -- here we are -- and look away, puzzled or embittered or cocksure.
 It's during the denouement of the deceptively modest plot that the big message is delivered, the long-awaited apocalyptic swipe brought to us by ... well, the Other Player in the mix. The novel unmasks itself as an elaborate, ingenious frame for a discourse on the nature of writing, and a platform from which to administer a strong kick of cosmic reality to the backside of mankind's roiling affairs. We're tossed onto the stage of a profound truth, where literature outperforms anything else.
 Good morning, Seattle. Welcome to New Orleans.

HEADLINE: 'Medical Apartheid'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In 15 chapters and 501 well-annotated pages, my book ''Medical Apartheid'' offers a careful, nuanced discussion of trends, cases, problems, ethics and persistent patterns in the disparate treatment of black research subjects. However, Ezekiel Emanuel's review (Feb. 18) ignores its rich content in order to claim that ''Medical Apartheid'' fails to place the experience of African-Americans in context. He dramatically misrepresents the work within an untrustworthy review that is rife with distortions, contradictions, errors, exaggerations and confusions.
Emanuel's own troubling research agenda, elements of which I criticize in ''Medical Apartheid,'' may be pertinent. He champions such dubious policies as offering undue inducement to poor people and offering research subjects in developing countries inferior medications and standards of protection.
 I have been allotted 650 words, insufficient for a point-by-point refutation, so I'll address a smattering of his many mischaracterizations and errors. 
 Emanuel ignores how consistently ''Medical Apartheid'' quantifies my statements about the disproportionate use of blacks in abusive medical research. For example, researchers' own statements reveal that the experimental development of gynecologic surgeries like Caesarian section, vesicovaginal fistula repair and ovariotomy were perfected almost exclusively using enslaved black women. The disproportionate theft of black cadavers was validated by records and events like the 1989 discovery of 9,800 bones, 75 percent from blacks, in the basement of the Medical College of Georgia's former anatomical laboratory. Dr. Eugene Saenger's fatal radiation experiments in 1950s Cincinnati were performed on a subject pool that was 75 percent black. The subjects of many other radiation experiments were all black, like the patients at Dooley and St. Phillip hospitals in Virginia who were intentionally given third-degree radiation burns by scientists ''for investigational purposes.'' By 1983, 43 percent of women sterilized by federally funded eugenic programs were black. Approximately 80 percent of the boys in the 1970s Baltimore XYY studies were black, as were nearly all of the children in that city's KKI lead study. Every boy in a 1990s New York City fenfluramine experiment was black.
 Medical treatment and public-health initiatives can also constitute medical research. Emanuel disingenuously writes as if an initiative must be either one or the other in order to accuse me of conflation. Despite Emanuel's bewildering claim to the contrary, the ''Black Stork'' chapter does focus heavily upon medical research, including racialized studies that fueled involuntary sterilizations, Norplant and Depo-Provera investigations, research distortions that created the myth of the ''crack baby,'' and nonconsensual research with pregnant black South Carolina women.
 Far from castigating directly observed therapy for tuberculosis, I lament that it is too often eschewed in favor of imprisonment. Thalidomide is indeed being given to black women subjects in Africa, and researchers fear that its presence in semen may make its use in men hazardous. Despite Emanuel's assertion, the book is supported by a plethora of notes filling 50 pages. 
 Emanuel's tenuous grasp of history is typified by his non-exculpatory focus on tangential, oft-told events and by the errors crammed into the single sentence with which he attempts to reconstruct the U.S.P.H.S. Study of Syphilis in the Untreated Negro Male. The men first were denied Salvarsan, not only penicillin; a significant minority obtained treatment; the study's goals included not only observation but also a validation of a racially dimorphic progression of syphilis and diagnostic refinements. Researchers' goals could not be accomplished without autopsy, and so were not achieved before death.
 He falsely claims that ''for Washington, the answer comes down to one thing: skin color.'' Actually, I describe a terrible confluence of factors that changed over time, including a precise variant, scientific racism. My discussion of factors that tempered or trumped racism includes economics, politics, utilitarianism, communitarianism, black complicity, white beneficence, forbidden knowledge, deontological frameworks and social-justice issues. Emanuel's failure to acknowledge these sophisticated arguments is a startling omission. Perhaps he is interested only in silencing them.Harriet A. WashingtonChicagoTo the Editor:
 Ezekiel Emanuel criticizes ''Medical Apartheid,'' a 501-page litany of historical research abuses against African-Americans, for failing to ''place the experience of African-Americans in a broader social, historical, scientific and ethical context.'' To support his point, Emanuel argues that risky research has been conducted not only on blacks but also on other vulnerable populations. This is certainly true but it is merely an argument for other books, not a reasonable argument against the need for ''Medical Apartheid.'' There are few other groups in America whose historical exposure to abusive research could fill a volume of similar size. From the infamous Tuskegee syphilis study to the literally hundreds of other examples that Washington meticulously documents, African-American subjects have been targeted for unethical research, in clear contradiction to Emanuel's charge that ''they have not been singled out exclusively or even predominantly.''
 Emanuel's sharply critical review was not surprising to those who follow this field. In 2006, he was the senior author of an academic paper arguing that African-Americans -- despite their widespread fear of the medical establishment -- were in fact as willing as whites to participate in health research. His group's methodology and conclusion have been sharply disputed. Emanuel has also written papers defending what some consider ethically troubling inducements to recruit research subjects in developing countries -- practices Washington has vehemently opposed. One can only wonder whether biases underlie his evisceration of this important book.Sheri FinkCambridge, Mass.The writer is a senior fellow of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative and a visiting scientist at the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights of the Harvard School of Public Health.To the Editor:
 I was distressed to read Emanuel's review of Washington's valuable book. It is not polemical to scrutinize the significance of race just because African-Americans ''have not been singled out exclusively'' for exploitation in our history. The exploration of race as a factor in medical trials is not ''simplistic'' merely because ''various vulnerable populations'' have also suffered unscrupulous or overzealous practices. Most insidiously, Emanuel seems to imply that the mere discussion of a disparate impact upon African-Americans somehow diminishes the importance of white or other Americans who have also died in research trials. Washington's book makes no such claim. The lessons in ''Medical Apartheid'' are for all time and for all humanity.Patricia J. WilliamsNew YorkThe writer is a professor of law at Columbia University.To the Editor:
 As a historian of medicine, I commend Emanuel's careful examination of ''Medical Apartheid.'' This perceptive appraisal, which respects the well-intentioned ambition of the book while showing how its abundant flaws make for inaccurate history, is an important public service.
 The book's errors are not trivial. Too often major distinctions are not acknowledged and quite different cases are thrown together. One must differentiate, for example, the trial-and-error efforts made by all doctors on all their patients to improve the sick person's situation as ethically and historically distinct from experiments that are nontherapeutic manipulations of otherwise healthy human beings in a search for general knowledge.
 Black Americans have sometimes received abuse at the hands of doctors in both clinical and experimental contexts, but this muddled account can neither honor their memory nor serve as a guide to preventing the recurrence of such problems.Bert HansenNew YorkThe writer is a professor of history at Baruch College, City University of New York.Ezekiel Emanuel replies:
 Attack the messenger when you don't like his message seems to be the theme of the letters by Washington, Fink and Williams. Ironically, this was just the reaction Washington claims she faced in researching her book. Equally ironically, on Page 387 of ''Medical Apartheid,'' to substantiate her claims that blacks are willing to enroll in research, Washington favorably cites my own study, a study Fink insinuates -- without specification -- has been ''sharply disputed,'' which hardly shows that its findings are false. 
 What is at issue is not my scholarship, but the accuracy of Washington's. Contrary to Washington and Fink's supposition, a book's quality is not determined by size. Fifteen chapters, 501 pages and hundreds of citations do not prove a book's historical veracity or the validity of its analysis.
 In many biomedical research studies blacks have been exploited and harmed. This is undeniable. But recounting cases in which blacks were abused in research cannot establish Washington's three claims: 1) that blacks have been distinctly targeted for research, 2) that blacks have borne a disproportionately large share of high risk in nontherapeutic research and 3) that this is largely the result of the ''racial homogeneity of American medical researchers.'' To validate these claims requires showing that blacks have been exploited more than whites and have been enrolled at higher rates in high-risk studies. Washington does not do this. Noting the many instances in which soldiers, the poor, the institutionalized and others have been exploited and suffered harms does not diminish the suffering of African-Americans enrolled in research, but it does raise questions about the disproportionate risk imposed on blacks and, more important, suggests that something besides the racism of researchers explains it. 
 Indeed, as the historian Todd Savitt, whom Washington repeatedly cites, states: ''Outright experimentation upon living humans may have occurred more openly and perhaps more often in the South owing to the nature of the slave society. No studies of human experimentation and use of white medical specimens in the North or South presently exist to substantiate this claim. ... Certainly, the indigent and socially voiceless were used by medical people for their own ends in the North.''
 Astute readers will note that none of the letters dispute the numerous errors in ''Medical Apartheid'' I documented. Even sympathetic reviewers have noted that Washington repeatedly and erroneously conflates treatment, public health measures and even statistical analyses that, in one reviewer's words, ''do not rise to the threshold of experimentation.'' They also cite cases, like the artificial heart studies, in which she is simply mistaken to charge that blacks were disproportionately targeted for high-risk research. A close reading shows the book still contains myriad exaggerated, false and distorted claims.

HEADLINE: Russ Whitney Wants You to Be Rich

BYLINE: By RANDALL PATTERSON. 
Randall Patterson, who lives in Asheville, N.C., has written for The New York Times Magazine, New York and Mother Jones.

 BODY:
Among the promises made after midnight to people who want to believe them, amid ads for the cream that will make you look young again and the ''motionless exercise'' system that will melt away your fat comes the voice from the television that asks, ''Are you among the thousands living paycheck to paycheck, just getting by, making payments on debts and credit cards?'' 
 And ''Have you ever wondered how it would feel being rich?''
Visions of wine-sipping then fill the screen, of golf-playing, of sailboats sailing into the sunset. Strolling down a dock, a smart-looking fellow in a bright polo shirt and khaki shorts turns to the camera and says, ''With real estate, there's no question you can amass the most amount of money in the least amount of time.'' 
 This is Russ Whitney, ''who started out working in a slaughterhouse for $5 an hour,'' the announcer tells us, ''and turned $1,000 in borrowed money into a personal wealth of $4.7 million -- in only 18 months!'' He has since devoted himself to helping others, the spot continues, and ''on this important television special,'' Whitney will show you how to build wealth -- ''even with only a part-time effort!''
 He is displayed standing before a rather plain-looking house. What would he do if he had ''no money and no credit''? Why, he'd go out and find a ''horrible''-looking house like this one and buy it ''with literally no money ... no banks involved.'' Then ''we do a little paint and clean-up, and we turn this right over for a $15,000 profit.''
 If you happen to doubt any of this, there is testimony from a woman who recently collected seven ugly houses in six months, thus replacing her yearly income, and from a man who says Russ Whitney ''changed my life.'' And, too, there is the former slaughterhouse worker himself, telling you again, amid swells of elevator music, that real estate is the fastest way to wealth for ''folks like you and me.''
 By this time, however, Whitney has switched into the future tense, and it becomes clear he is not actually going to reveal any of his wealth-building techniques until you attend one of his ''truly unique'' workshops. Not only is admission to this ''special, limited-seating event'' free, but Whitney will also give you, ''absolutely free,'' his special Russ Whitney's Building Wealth Entrepreneur Start-Up Kit -- ''a $199 value.'' In other words, he will pay you to attend, so how could you not? ''You have everything to gain by attending!'' ''Call now!'' ''Operators are standing by.'' And so on.
 In this way, a sorting process begins. Most people are not awake after midnight to avail themselves of such opportunities. Of those who are, a smaller number shop for answers in infomercials. Fewer still reach for the phone. Those who do call and who attend the first Whitney workshop find that it is mainly a sales event for another workshop. The fraction that agree to pay a few hundred dollars proceed to the second hotel workshop, where they discover yet another sales event, or what sounds from the description of participants like a Holy Ghost revival. A powerful speaker stokes passions until, one by one, about 20 percent of the audience rise from their seats -- the number is reliable, according to the company -- and consent to pay thousands of dollars each to learn how to get rich through real estate.
 In staging some 4,700 free events a year, Whitney Information Network attracts some 280,000 people, of whom 22,000 go on to enroll as students in advanced courses. Last November at the Clarion Hotel in Louisville, Pat Yarbrough, a 56-year-old custodian at the University of Louisville, became one of them. ''Fast money,'' she explained later, ''that's all I'm interested in.'' At the front of the conference room, a nice man had taught her how to raise her credit-card debt limit, she said, and when she made her way with a cane to the back, a nice clerk showed her what she could buy: three-day courses with names like Rehabbing for Profit and Keys to Creative Real Estate Financing. The courses cost $4,995 each, but less if you bought more. Yarbrough chose four, including the Millionaire U Real Estate Training. She had $130,000 in debt, some of it on her seven credit cards, and the clerk helped her to add $18,000 to it.
 A month later, the custodian from Louisville joined an electrician from Baltimore, an unemployed longshoreman from Delaware, a roofing contractor from New Jersey and an elderly doctor from Sebastian, Fla., at Russ Whitney's Wealth Intelligence Academy, where they were welcomed as ''advanced students,'' ''the creme de la creme,'' and promised that all would be revealed.
 Cape Coral, Fla., is bright sun, a jungle of strip malls -- the sort of town where a wealth intelligence academy fits right in. ''Good morning, everybody!'' Whitney called out to his sales staff on a bright day in December. ''Are we having fun yet?'' He was tanned and moussed; at 51, he looked like a million bucks. ''Good morning,'' he greeted a secretary. ''How are you?'' When she began complaining of cold symptoms, Whitney cut her off: ''You don't have cancer, do you? You're doing great!'' After lunch, he played basketball in the lobby, pushing down one of his executives and driving to the hoop. Late afternoon found Whitney in his office, chatting on the phone with Robert Kiyosaki, the author of ''Rich Dad, Poor Dad,'' about whether to go on safari together -- or as Whitney put it, ''whether I should go out and kill things with you.''
 To look at Whitney now, you don't have to wonder how it feels to be rich. He has been all over television talking about it. He's spoken of it to countless audiences, written about it in several books, including ''Millionaire Real Estate Mentor,'' a BusinessWeek best seller. (Last fall, Whitney also appeared in New York City as a panelist at a New York Times-sponsored event, the Great Read in the Park.) His rags-to-riches tale has been worn smooth, but he knows it's a good story, and nothing else quite conveys his exceptional pluck.
 After a ''very miserable'' childhood, he begins again, he developed an association with some shady characters. ''I pretty much became a car thief,'' he says. ''I was damn good at it, too -- steal a car in 15 seconds.'' But Whitney wasn't too good at crime to avoid getting caught for second-degree robbery, and it was only after a year and a half in prison that he wound up, in 1976, at the slaughterhouse in Albany.
 ''I was a piece of dung,'' he remembered. Many people live with that feeling, but Whitney wasn't about to, and he reached for the first of several texts that changed him -- a Zig Ziglar volume on positive thinking. The book told him that happiness basically depends on a denial of reality, that ''if you're going to be a positive guy, have a good attitude,'' he said, ''you've got to say things like 'super!' and 'fantastic!' '' Whitney had just gotten out of prison and thought this was the stupidest thing he'd ever heard. He wanted to be happy, though, and so tried to believe it and was soon wandering the slaughterhouse saying ''super'' and ''fantastic.'' The longer he tried to see the bright side, the more he thought he actually did. 
 Within three months of arriving at the slaughterhouse, Whitney had convinced a woman there to marry him for richer, for poorer. Within a year, he'd decided he was far too smart to go on killing hogs for life and was meant instead for ''something big.'' Whitney began shopping among the get-rich-quick schemes advertised in the backs of magazines. He had spent hundreds of dollars on such offers before he came upon another book that changed him: William Nickerson's ''How I Turned $1,000 Into $3 Million in Real Estate in My Spare Time.''
 ''Everything clicked,'' Whitney said. He saw that real estate was an investment he could control. Its value over the long term generally rose, and could in fact be forced up. If he combined ''a sensible, mathematical approach with the proper exit strategy,'' Whitney said, he would know in advance of a deal whether he would profit. ''And the book said you can be a millionaire in time,'' he recalled, ''and I thought, Shoot, I can do that. I mean, I got it! I understood that concept. And from that point on, my sole focus was to become a millionaire.''
 His first deal in Schenectady was a ''steal.'' In another, he extracted ''exceptional terms'' from a 65-year-old widow. After making the purchase, Whitney would rise early and take his baby daughter with him to the property, while his wife worked at the slaughterhouse. All day he would paint and clean, not returning until night for his own slaughterhouse shift. This schedule went on for years. ''Hustle is heaven if you're a hustler,'' he wrote in his first book, but Whitney's life was difficult enough that eventually he felt the need for stronger medicine than Zig Ziglar or William Nickerson could offer. 
 A third book that changed him was the Bible. Whitney says he reads it ''for wisdom and forgiveness'' for 15 minutes every morning after his workout. Without the Bible, he asked me, ''how would you know not to steal?'' Without the Bible, he said, ''I'd be doing a whole lot of not looking in the mirror.'' He seems to have hesitated in his faith only once, when he read in Matthew, Mark and Luke that ''it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.'' Whitney could understand the words only as they appeared: it seemed the Bible frowned on wealth-building almost as much as upon stealing. ''I was trying to figure that out,'' he remembered, when his Baptist preacher intervened to explain, no, no -- certain passages of the Bible must not be taken literally. A rich man must try harder to get into heaven, it's true, but the preacher told him, ''God wants you to be successful.''
 Whitney says he has gone on to hundreds of real estate deals, contributing to his Baptist church all the while. He had been investing in real estate for seven years when, ''by the age of 27,'' according to the official bio, ''he was one of America's youngest self-made millionaires.'' Whitney moved his family from New York to Cape Coral, a ''very positive, beautiful place,'' he says. Now he seems to have what rich people are supposed to -- a Ferrari, a company plane, ''probably close to the biggest house in town,'' he says -- and he happily puts his net worth at ''oh, I would say in excess of $100 million for sure.'' All Whitney really wants is more. ''I'm an opportunist,'' he explains. ''I'm a businessman.''
 The one regret he mentions is that he ever put faith in get-rich-quick schemes. So many were just ''a lot of hype and baloney,'' Whitney says, and it was to tell the truth about what real estate had done for him that he wrote his first book. Whitney Information Network is now a public company that employs roughly 475 people and that took in about $160 million in revenue in 2005, according to its annual report, all on the promise that anyone might become rich like Whitney, if he will only do as Whitney has done. The difference, though, between Whitney and those who come to WIN is that he bought his first real estate book for just $10, and they pay up to $54,000 a head for the full course package. When I asked if he would have enrolled in his school when he was starting out, Whitney said no. Then he added, ''I shouldn't say that,'' and began trying to take it back.
 Millionaire U is the three-day real estate training course designed to ''put you on the fast track to success.'' The conference room at Whitney headquarters gradually filled in mid-December with blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians, Haitians and Jamaicans. As Whitney said later: ''We had America in there. We had America at Millionaire University.'' 
 The students sat without talking beneath fluorescent lights, about 40 midnight loners waiting as though for a test. ''Real estate is a people-person business,'' the instructor told them, so get introduced. Gladstone from Fort Lauderdale stood to say he was a physician's assistant ''tired, very tired'' of 16 years of 16-hour days; for this and other courses, he had paid Whitney $14,000 and hoped to increase his cash flow. Terrin from Delaware was a single parent and unemployed longshoreman whose car had recently been repossessed; he had paid Whitney $20,000 to teach him ''how to not make mistakes.'' Before coming here, Pat Yarbrough, the custodian from Louisville, had given a different get-rich guru $24,000; that plan didn't work, but she was convinced this would be different. Probably the most educated man in the room was Havelock Thompson, the elderly doctor from Sebastian, Fla. He had spent his career caring for indigents -- ''doing more good than making money.'' After buying a $53,000 package from Whitney, he expected to gross $1 million in the next two years, which no one there seemed to think unrealistic. They were all hoping to make a change in their lives.
 Pacing before them was Tracie Taylor, a sleek African-American woman in red lipstick and dark business suit. ''How many of you want to be millionaires?'' she called out. When every hand shot up, Taylor told them she hoped they would raise their goals; millionaires have become passe. Getting rich, as she explained it, seemed mainly a matter of positive thinking. ''Our challenge is not real estate investing,'' the broker said, ''but changing your belief systems.'' Immediately she got to work.
 She told the students that they were solutions-oriented individuals and that the solution they were oriented toward was money. The economy is divided, Taylor said, between the rich and the poor, ''and you can choose which side you want to be on.''
 She advised the students to cease identifying with the poor. There are more people making a little than there are making a lot, and those people, she said, need places to live. Expect to become landlords, she told the class. The neighborhoods they should expect to work in -- ''good cash-flow areas'' -- are indicated by the presence of laundromats, pawn shops and any boulevard bearing the name Martin Luther King, she told them on a tour of one such neighborhood. To find deals, she recommended keeping an ear out for death, divorce, job loss, any kind of despair. ''Situations,'' she whispered with a grin; they tend to create motivated sellers. One must approach them gently. It's important to be positive, to look as though you care about someone's situation -- and it's absolutely essential that you not care. When you make your lowball offer, you'll have to stand firm; when tenants don't pay the rent, you'll have to evict. ''The cardinal rule of real estate is don't get emotionally attached,'' Taylor instructed. ''Here's what you get attached to: ROI.'' Return on investment.
 The students solemnly wrote her instructions down. Much of what was said clashed with the instincts of Dr. Thompson, who said he couldn't imagine himself as a landlord, ''screwing in light bulbs for people less fortunate'' or, in any case, making money without doing good. ''My conscience wouldn't allow it,'' he added, but he seemed one of only a few with that problem. As the course went on, the challenge for most students appeared not to be changing their belief systems but learning the rudiments of real estate.
 Taylor knew early that her class of advanced students was strictly remedial. Assessing them, she found that only 8 of 40 had invested in real estate before. The infomercial had talked of buying and quickly selling houses, and those who enrolled seemed largely unaware of the real estate slump.
 Taylor introduced a hard-charging mortgage broker who began moving rapid-fire through nonconforming NINAs and no docs, PITI reserves and the 28/36 rule. At last, she looked up: ''Everyone's shaking their heads like they know this,'' she said. And she rolled right on.
 ''The second calculation is the same as the first ... the balance is divided by ... the rate is 12 percent so ... and that's how you get a blended rate ... and what if it's an adjustable rate ... negative amortization, but I prefer not to be negative so let's say deferred interest ... and ... we're done. Any questions?''
 There wasn't a one. ''You guys are too quiet!'' the broker said.
 Then came another banker. He was talking carefully about regulations, financing, exotic mortgages when a voice rang out: ''We want to know how to find the deal when you drive around!'' It was a Haitian man from Brooklyn. ''Talk to the real estate guy,'' the banker said. ''I'm the banker.'' But the man only replied, ''We want to know how to find the deal when you drive around!'' 
 They were eager to be good students, but blurted out terrible answers. ''Where did you guys study math?'' Taylor asked. Later, she realized that not one student could even name the world's richest man. ''People with goals are the ones who succeed,'' she lectured, and she assigned her class the homework of compiling a hundred goals. The next day, when she asked all who had completed the homework to stand, the doctor rose, stunned to find himself alone. ''Why are you surprised?'' Taylor asked him.
 Yarbrough the custodian, meanwhile, sat fanning herself with her notebook, asking for words to be defined, concepts repeated. She said she wasn't getting much out of the presentations. She was mainly waiting, she admitted, for that lesson on how to buy houses without money.
 Taylor at last felt obliged to tell the class that ''real estate investing is not a get-rich-quick scheme.'' They would have to work hard, and they would have to get informed. ''All the data's yours for the taking,'' she said. And that must surely have been the most confusing lesson, because it was exactly contrary to what the students had been told at the sales event. Information was supposed to be hard to come by, available only at high cost. What had they paid for, after all? Why had they come all this way to the Wealth Intelligence Academy?
 In his official company biography, Whitney says that ''his greatest achievement is the success of his students.'' The immediate effect of becoming a Whitney student, though, is not to get rich, but poorer. The infomercial addresses people who are ''just getting by, making payments on debts and credit cards.'' Among the first lessons Whitney instructors teach is how to raise the limits on their credit cards, and then how to plunge deeper into debt buying Whitney courses. 
 Documents his company submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission show that as chief executive, Whitney took home $1.6 million in salary and bonus in 2005. Minutes after telling me that he would not, when starting out, have enrolled in his school, he tried to explain that he would ''probably have progressed a whole lot faster'' if he had. He would have bought the $24,000 ''platinum package,'' he said, adding, ''Would have took a platinum for sure.'' Perhaps it would have meant going into debt, but that makes sense to him. He was unabashed that his instructors help students put the cost of those courses on credit cards. Don't most colleges help to arrange student loans? ''Of course they do,'' he said. Compared with the cost of college, his school is ''a bargain,'' Whitney added, and ''when you think about it, too, the business we're in, that money comes back very fast.''
 In his book ''Millionaire Real Estate Mentor,'' Whitney claims to have ''helped thousands of people become wealthy.'' On Whitney's Web site, the volume of ''success stories'' appears to support the claim -- but when you read the stories, many are nothing more than testimonials of good will. I asked the company for examples of students who became wealthy thanks to what they learned. After many weeks, the company gave me a list of seven people, three whose success had prompted Whitney to hire them as mentors for new students and two others who were doing business with Whitney. Six of the seven returned calls; three claimed they had become millionaires. The impression they left is that some Whitney students do indeed become wealthy, but that they are the exceptions.
 The company recently reported that it was under investigation by the S.E.C. and the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The Florida and Kansas attorneys general are looking into Whitney's company for deceptive advertising, and they are not the first to have done so. Perhaps the most revealing case was brought by the state of Tennessee and settled in 1997. Promoting a seminar, Whitney had placed newspaper ads, according to court records, that read, ''Millionaire Swears Under Oath He Can Show Any Nashville Area Resident How to Get Rich in a Year.'' The attorney general objected that Whitney had ''not in fact made any such statement under oath'' and seems to have been astonished when Whitney ''informed the state that this claim is simply 'advertising language.' '' ''In fact,'' the attorney general wrote in the complaint, ''Mr. Whitney has informed the state that in making his claim that he can show any Nashvillian how to become 'rich' in a year, he did not necessarily mean that anyone would become 'rich' financially, but 'rich' in a spiritual sense.''
 The state dropped the case after Whitney agreed never again to advertise unlikely results from use of a Whitney product in Tennessee without disclosing that such results would be ''rare, highly unusual, exceptional or atypical and not to be expected by the average person.'' If Whitney still wished to advertise that he could help people get rich, he would also have to disclose that his ''use of the term 'rich' does not refer to financial success but is intended to refer to other standards.''
 Whitney says now that while he consented to pay costs and fees of $9,500 in Tennessee, he admitted no wrongdoing -- and that the Tennessee attorney general quoted him out of context. In an e-mail he wrote that ''every claim in our ads can be documented'' and that with altered ads, the company continues to do business in Tennessee and would be shown to be in full compliance with all laws in Florida and Kansas. 
 His work is ''God-driven,'' Whitney insists. How many of his students become materially wealthy, he claimed not to know. But even for those who don't, he said, the training still has value. Spiritual value, in other words. ''We help people build self-confidence,'' Whitney explained. ''We help them believe in themselves again.'' The students who come to him, ''some of them, you know, couldn't work,'' he said, and then they start ''thinking on their own,'' and Whitney watches as they ''break out from more conventional America'' and recognize, ''Holy cow, I can be somebody!'' He added, ''That doesn't necessarily mean be somebody wealth-wise.''
 Toward the end of the class, Taylor told her students that most of them would become financially independent. ''Many of you will become multimillionaires,'' she said. Hoping to become somebody wealth-wise, Yarbrough signed up for yet more classes. Her purchases added another $11,500 to her debt, but she reasoned, ''If I make the money they say I will, it won't make any difference.''
 On the last day of the course Taylor rather grandly introduced ''my mentor, my friend, Mr. Russ Whitney!'' Whitney came bounding in carrying a water bottle, as though fresh from his workout. As a teacher, he told me, his reward is the gratification he feels when greeting students who are learning how to change their lives. The students quickly surrounded Whitney and proceeded to gratify him with hugs and handshakes and photos. Dr. Thompson patted him on the back. Yarbrough got his autograph. A nurse from New Jersey said she was ''so touched'' to learn that Whitney's a Christian, and Whitney answered, ''Let me tell you, I've been blessed to handle God's money.''
 He was soon strutting before them, saying again that real estate is ''the simplest way to make a lot of money'' but warning them to be careful out there, because ''people don't always have your best interests in mind.'' In fact, he said ''in 9 out of 10 cases they don't.'' And that's why they needed more education -- to learn what they could expect.
 ''We've got a lot of classes,'' he went on. ''You probably think they're expensive.''
 ''They are expensive!'' Yarbrough called out from the front of the class.
 Whitney turned to regard her. Yarbrough stared back at him. He began to insist that his profit margins were reasonable, that he wasn't gouging anyone, but Yarbrough quickly stopped him. ''Let me say,'' she replied, ''that if we didn't want to be here, we wouldn't be here. Nobody twisted our arms.'' 
 Whitney couldn't help but snort. He said he'd fire the salesman who didn't twist arms, and everybody had a good laugh.

HEADLINE: Pop Psychology

BYLINE: By ROGER LOWENSTEIN. 
Roger Lowenstein, a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine, is writing a book about the pension crisis.

 BODY:
It has become common to refer to sharp escalations in asset prices as ''bubbles,'' and we know what bubbles do -- they pop. There are people who think we have a bubble in real estate going, and no wonder. Prices have been going through the roof. Forget (for the moment) home prices. An office building in Allentown, Pa., just went for the kind of change you could formerly expect for Midtown Manhattan, and in Gotham itself, where $400 a square foot was until recently a kingly price, the $1,000 threshold has been broken. While this is interesting to anyone who owns an office building, I personally do not know any such people, although I am certain they must be very rich. I do, however, know a goodly number of homeowners, and every one of them seems to be wondering the same thing: Are we going over a cliff? 
Since last year, when new home construction stopped in its tracks and the rate of home sales (in hot markets) dropped by a third, the experts, the real estate writers, the listing agents, have been listening very hard for that popping sound. Prices have eased -- by a point or two in many markets, by as much as 5 percent in Boston. Prognosticators have forecast a recession, with banks up to their eyeballs in foreclosed mortgages and ordinary folk bailing out of their center-hall colonials. 
 Such alarmist sentiment is at odds with the conventional, and comforting, view: that real estate is ''different'' from other, purely financial markets, and that a house, in particular, is a more reliable investment than a dot-com stock. But is it? 
 The notion that we are on the cusp of a crash in housing in fact has its roots in the Nasdaq bust. Early in 2001, as the tech slide deepened, Alan Greenspan began to furiously lower short-term interest rates, eventually taking them to 1 percent. Presumably, that helped ease the recession. But housing prices began to surge. Robert Shiller, a Yale economist and critical observer of the housing market, says that home prices doubled between 2000 and 2006. On the coasts and in certain ostensibly desirable places to live (like Las Vegas), they did much better. Cheap money, courtesy of the Fed, was deemed responsible -- even culpable. In many quarters, Greenspan was essentially accused of cheating the country out of the depression we deserved: instead of allowing the swooning Nasdaq to bring down the United States economy and punish us for our sins, he had rolled the tech bubble into a housing bubble and allowed the party to go on.
 The causality is by no means proven (mortgage rates, after all, are influenced mostly by long-term interest rates, over which the Fed has no control). But we are getting ahead of ourselves. Just which factors determine housing prices -- interest rates or psychology or maybe the price of aluminum siding -- is a matter for debate. What is certain is that in 2006, housing prices topped and began heading south. 
 Many experts believe that prices will continue to fall but not ''too much.'' This is no reason for relief: economists generally do not predict crashes until they have happened. 
 On the other side, the most forceful proponent of the bubble analogy is Shiller, who made his name by predicting that the stock market would crack. Shiller has been writing and speechifying that housing prices are due for a ''huge'' fall, possibly on the order of 50 percent. He and Karl Case, an economist at Wellesley College, have constructed indices of housing in 20 United States markets for the purpose of letting people bet on housing futures just as they do on soybeans or, as he put it, to ''protect'' themselves -- presumably against the approaching apocalypse. (These housing futures began trading last May on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.)
 Shiller's gloominess has been widely noted. He thinks we are under the spell of that familiar goblin, mass psychology. Lemming-like, people are buying homes merely because they expect that prices will rise. This certainly holds for speculators, like the manager of a rental-car agency at the Tampa airport who confessed to a customer (an economist) that he owned no fewer than 20 condominiums. And it explains some of the impulse to buy second homes, which are closer to being tradable assets than a primary residence is. 
 Shiller has been surveying ordinary homeowners, however, and he says that they, too, have fallen victim to irrationality, much as Internet investors did. He suggests that once reality sets in, prices could drop in a hurry, instead of slowly unwinding.
 There is no doubt that most homeowners think they are living in an appreciating asset. The fact that people buy homes even though rentals are relatively cheap (in Boston, for example, rents have scarcely risen at all in the last decade) implies that buyers willingly pay for the privilege of ownership. But does this mean they are behaving irrationally?
 Home prices do go up, although most people would be surprised at how slow the appreciation has been. According to the National Association of Realtors, housing prices traditionally rise two points faster than inflation, a relatively modest rate. And even in the past two decades, a period that includes the recent boom, anyone who owned a diversified portfolio of stocks handily outperformed American housing, even in markets like New York. 
 So how have so many Americans been able to convert their nests into (sizable) nest eggs? Most people who buy homes would not be able to tell you -- but they have profited from it all the same. 
 The dirty little secret of home ownership is that it lets you play with other people's money. Say you want to purchase the median home (in California the cost would be about $565,000, but let's take the United States median, which would run you $220,000). Typically, you would take perhaps $50,000 from savings as a down payment, borrow the balance and pay the monthly mortgage from your income. 
 But wait! Just before you close, a friendly real estate bear points out that you could rent the same house, or a similar one. Your monthly payment would go to the landlord, not the bank. And you could invest the $50,000 in stocks, which, with dividends, might appreciate at close to 10 percent a year, rather than the 5 percent or so you could expect from your house. 
 That would be a very dumb move. Suppose the stock market did rise 10 percent; after a year you would be up $5,000. Whereas the gain on your home would be 5 percent over the entire purchase price -- or $11,000. Over 10 years the gap becomes huge -- not to mention over 20 or 30 years. This is the little guy's (and also Donald Trump's) trick for accumulating equity: leverage. 
 In theory, there is no reason why you couldn't also borrow to invest in stocks. The Federal Reserve puts limits on this sort of thing, however, and so do brokerages. If you borrow up to the max on your stock portfolio, you have to pay back losses as they occur, day by day. That makes leverage in stocks rather risky, as some folks discovered in 1929. Indeed, imagine what would happen if similar rules applied to mortgage holders: on any day that housing prices fell you would have to ante up more capital or forfeit your home. I would still be paying rent and so would you. But the home market evolved with fixed long-term financing (mortgages), and not ill-advisedly. Real estate, for most people, is a long-term asset. Banks can lend you the money, within reasonable limits, and not have to sweat the nightly news. 
 This is the problem I have with the real-estate-equals-dot-com argument. Most homeowners buy to have a place to live. If prices fall, they react precisely unlike stock traders; rather than bail out, they stay put longer. Every share of Cisco may be for sale every day, but every house is not. Case, Shiller's partner, tracked 628 home listings in the Boston area during 2006, as prices began to fall. After four months, the majority remained unsold, but the sellers lowered their asking prices by only 3 to 4 percent. While Case says this demonstrates that real estate is ''stickier'' than financial assets, Shiller says it proves that owners are delusional -- unwilling to admit that real estate goes down as well as up. 
 And for sure, it does. The declines can be protracted, though usually not as steep as in financial markets. In the '90s, for instance, the United States suffered a rolling housing recession from California to New England to the Mid-Atlantic. Los Angeles, which was hit the hardest, slumped for four years running, during which prices fell 25 percent. 
 Those serial recessions were caused by a string of economic problems, like defense industry closures, layoffs in the oil patch, a slump on Wall Street. The pullback that began in 2006 is different, and rather unusual. High prices stimulated a spree of home building and, ultimately, too much supply. That put pressure on prices. 
 A potentially alarming feature of this cycle is that more people stretched the the limits of what they could afford by taking out mortgages with adjustable rates. If interest rates were to rise, they could be in trouble. Even with rates having stayed, thus far, mercifully low, the rate of foreclosures is up slightly. And there is particular concern about the mortgages held by distressed buyers, so-called subprime loans.
 But here's an interesting fact: Foreclosures (and delinquencies) are lower in expensive markets, like Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, than they are elsewhere. Foreclosures are higher in Ohio and Michigan, where housing is cheaper but the economy has been hurting. 
 By and large, people forfeit their homes not because they paid too much for them, but because they lost a job or suffered a similar setback, such as an illness. The bursting of the housing bubble thus seems less painful than would a good old-fashioned recession.
 And how much of a bubble has it been?
 It is hard to give a precise answer because, unlike the intrinsic value of a stock, or even an apartment building, that of a house is somewhat obscure. For a commercial property, the guiding metric is the income (rent) the property produces. So we can know whether the market for office buildings is zany. Equity Office Properties, the biggest publicly held office landlord in the United States, just agreed to a $39 billion buyout in which, tellingly, the buyer immediately (that day) resold $7 billion of its new trophies to a third party. This buy-and-flip has the whiff of speculation. And sure enough, over the last few years the price of prime office space has vaulted from roughly 12 times underlying rental incomes to 20 times. 
 Actually, the same sort of math holds for home markets. If you buy in Chevy Chase, Md., to rent out at a profit, forget it. Rental rates have not kept up. So if home prices were driven simply by their potential for income, everyone would sell right now. 
 But most people think of their house as living space, not rental property. As to what does drive home prices, the evidence is mixed. One answer is interest rates, and the drop in rates explains a lot of the recent boom. Another idea is incomes -- what people can afford. Shiller's theory is that, in a rational world, the price of a house would reflect the cost of replacing it -- the cost of the raw materials and the labor. This was undoubtedly true when people lived in log cabins. But as choice developable land becomes scarcer, people become willing to pay more. 
 Anyway, you would think that home markets, being disconnected from fundamentals like rent, would be riskier than investment markets. And maybe they are. But the average public real estate investment trust (the stocks that own office buildings and such) has nearly tripled in five years. Among residential markets, not even Las Vegas has grown that fast. 
 In fact, people are always bolder in a market that is liquid -- they figure they can get out -- than with an asset for which selling requires a listing, a broker, a title search. Which is why the new Web sites like Zillow.com, on which people can check their home values as often as the price of Yahoo!, and even Shiller's dream of an active futures market, may not be the welcome innovations they might seem. The stickiness of home markets, the lack of continuous liquidity and information, makes them different from stocks. Come the day when they are broadcasting your home value on CNBC, look out.

BYLINE: By ANDREW RICE. 
Andrew Rice, a writer living in Brooklyn, has covered New York real estate. He is now writing a book about Uganda.

 BODY:
Mario Procida -- son of a construction boss, grandson of an immigrant stonemason -- was stalking his natural habitat, a building site. As usual, he was doing several things at once, all of them distractedly. The 49-year-old developer had come down from his family firm's office in the Bronx to show me around his latest project, On Prospect Park, a 15-story, 114-unit luxury apartment building at the eastern edge of Brooklyn's Grand Army Plaza. Being who he was, however, Procida couldn't help turning our little tour of the unfinished eighth floor into an exacting inspection of the work in progress. Procida believes that his building, designed by the famed architect Richard Meier, will soon be recognized as one of the most aesthetically significant structures ever erected in the borough. At this point, however, On Prospect Park was still little more than a skeleton of round pillars and naked concrete slabs, bunted with orange netting and open to the stiff autumn breeze. Procida spotted a few imperfections, necessitating a series of gruff cellphone calls to subordinates. ''I would venture to guess that this is the most complex residential building that I have ever seen,'' he told me. 
 Procida's BlackBerry buzzed. It was Sheldon Gordon, a multimillionaire shopping-mall developer who is one of Procida's two partners in the project. ''Hey, Sheldon, I'm out at the building,'' Procida shouted. ''What can I tell you? It's spectacular.'' After he hung up, Procida led me onto a creaky construction elevator that took us up to the penthouse level, where seven units -- five of them duplexes -- are selling for $2 million to $6 million. He darted up a concrete stairwell to the most expensive unit's roof deck, where three people were waiting for him: a gray-bearded man in a tweed jacket; his companion, a demure woman wearing a Yankees cap; and Johanna Beiter, a real estate agent who was showing them the place. Procida -- stocky, balding, wearing a lavender shirt, a blue sweater vest and casual white slacks -- threw open his arms as he strode toward the roof's rough edge. ''It doesn't get any better than this,'' he said, ''does it?''
Usually, the real estate agents marketing On Prospect Park don't offer such tours to prospective buyers; a building's birth, like the human kind, is a messy thing to witness. But the bearded man was a roofing contractor by profession, so he could presumably be trusted to look past the rusty nails and the stalks of protruding rebar and to focus on what was really important: the $6 million view. The rain had stopped momentarily, and the sun was streaming through the clouds as if in a Turner landscape. To the left was the rolling expanse of Prospect Park, where red and yellow leaves were still clinging to the trees. Straightaway were the greenish church steeples of Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens, and the Statue of Liberty was somewhere out in the foggy harbor. To the right, in the distance, was the familiar Manhattan skyline. In the foreground stood Brooklyn's landmark Williamsburgh Savings Bank tower, which was in the process of being converted into luxury condominiums itself.
 In fact, almost any direction you looked, some once-scruffy corner of Brooklyn was under renovation. Next to the bank building lay the Atlantic Yards site, the proposed future location of a mammoth office, housing and sporting complex designed by Frank Gehry. Down on the borough's East River waterfront, shiny glass residential buildings were sprouting like marsh grass. This decade's real estate boom has favored Brooklyn, where overall property valuations rose 26.7 percent last year. In 2005, the last year for which complete data are available, more units of housing were constructed in Brooklyn than in Manhattan. 
 On Prospect Park represents the climax, at least for now, of this trend. For years, well-to-do artistic types -- the actress Jennifer Connelly, for instance, and the novelist Jonathan Safran Foer -- have come to Brooklyn for its handsome (and increasingly pricey) brownstones. But Procida is trying to sell the richest on a very different vision of Brooklyn life. His building is located on the edge of a gentrified zone, in a ZIP code where the median household income is less than $40,000 a year, at the edge of a neighborhood, Crown Heights, that is probably best known as the site of deadly race-related incidents 16 years ago. But Procida is marketing it like a little outpost of Manhattan, importing a voguish sales tool from across the river: the idea of packaging apartments as inhabitable art. In Manhattan, new residential buildings designed by famous architects like Meier, Charles Gwathmey, Jean Nouvel and the chic Swiss firm Herzog & de Meuron have been marketed, at enormous prices and with varying degrees of success, as the latest symbols of cosmopolitan wealth -- the kinds of places Calvin Klein and Nicole Kidman choose to rest their stylish heads. But no one tried it in Brooklyn before. The working theory is that in an uncertain economy, at a moment when the real estate market seems to be cooling, it's smartest to bet on those who worry about money the least, building for the rich and their high-end tastes. ''That market's pretty much immune'' to market forces, said Louis V. Greco Jr., Procida's third partner in On Prospect Park. ''People are into Richard Meier, so they'll go and buy in Richard Meier's building, and they'll pay a premium.''
 On Prospect Park seems almost custom-designed to test the untried notion that the vaulting ambitions of great architecture are not subject to the dragging influence of supply and demand. Procida's fellow developers are watching the project with keen interest and some skepticism. ''I know Mario well, I knew his dad well and Mario and I have been partners on deals before,'' said Carlton Brown, a developer who is building a 250-unit luxury condominium complex called the Kalahari in Harlem, another epicenter of new residential construction. ''Mario is clearly a risk taker. I think the building is going to be a great building. But when Mario showed me the building, I said, 'That's a risky building to put up in Brooklyn.' ''
 Procida likes to turn the implicit question ''Who'd move to Brooklyn?'' on its head. The revived borough is full of newly desirable locations, he says, but he owns the best one of all. ''This is the most prominent site in the borough,'' he said proudly the day I visited the building, after we were back on ground level. He gestured out toward Grand Army Plaza, which is dominated by a Parisian-style triumphal arch. ''This is the crowning piece of Eastern Parkway. You've got the arch. You've got the entrance to the park. You've got the Brooklyn Museum.'' Procida, who has a master's degree in architecture from U.C.L.A., said that he hoped that Meier's diaphanous glass-walled building would one day evoke comparisons to such Modernist masterpieces as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Lake Shore Drive Apartments in Chicago. ''This is a great building,'' Procida said. ''And there aren't that many great buildings that are built.''
 By the time we went down to the plaza, the bearded businessman and his companion had already driven away in their BMW. Procida quizzed Beiter, the real estate agent, who told him the couple seemed most impressed with Unit 8E, a three-bedroom with a large terrace that listed at $3.6 million, and Penthouse F, a larger version of the same. Though On Prospect Park's sales office had opened only the week before and the building will not be completed until the summer of 2008, Procida told me that buyers had already signed contracts on four condominiums. That left just 110 to sell.
 It wasn't hard to pick the real estate guy out of the crowd loitering in front the Helmsley Building on Park Avenue a few days before Christmas. He was the puckish man in the pinstripe suit, puffing on the Davidoff cigarillo. Billy Procida -- Mario's younger brother, former partner, temperamental opposite and occasional tormentor -- pushed open the door to Bobby Van's Steakhouse and asked the maitre d'hotel for a table by the window. 
 ''It's a big bet,'' the younger Procida told me when I asked him what he thought about his brother's new building. He sounded proud and a little envious. He was used to being the adventurous one in the family. In 1985, New York magazine profiled Billy Procida in an article titled ''The Boy Who Would Be Trump.'' Billy was 23, and Mario was 28. The two of them posed for a photograph outside a riverside condominium complex they'd built together near the Throgs Neck Bridge in the Bronx. Mario, his ample head of hair slicked back, wore sunglasses and a bow tie. But Billy was the center of the article's attention, as he showed off his gold Mercedes and boasted that he had never read a book, ''except one on real estate,'' and generally came off as an embodiment of the mid-1980s, when freewheeling developers used easy credit to throw up speculative buildings all over New York. Needless to say, the boom did not end happily.
 The brothers dissolved their partnership in the mid-1990s, after 13 profitable and argumentative years, and Billy now runs Palisades Financial, a sizable real estate investment firm based in New Jersey. But he still gets sentimental when he talks about that first project he and Mario did, White Beach. He had just scraped through high school, and his father, an old-school type -- ''a 250-pound construction guy with two pinkie rings, the works,'' Billy said -- helped him acquire three and a half acres along the East River. One night, so the story goes, Billy was up late brainstorming with Mario, who was visiting home from U.C.L.A. The brothers came up with the concept of a condominium complex set on a marina, like something out of ''Miami Vice.'' 
 They ended up building it. Mario designed the doors to look like sails. Now, two decades later, his younger brother pulled out an aerial photograph of White Beach. ''When we built this,'' Billy said, running his finger along the image of the tiered white stucco buildings, ''they said we would never break $100,000 a unit here. We sold that for over $200,000 a unit. Why? There was nothing like this. Nothing like it!'' He told me the same principle held true for On Prospect Park. ''In a city of 10 million people, there's always 100 rich people who will pay for a piece of fine art,'' he said. ''As far as I know, Mario's got the only piece of fine art in Brooklyn.''
 Mario Procida is named for his paternal grandfather. The original Mario Procida came over from Sicily in 1928 and ran the family construction firm out of a tiny storefront on East Seventh Street in Manhattan. His son Joseph stayed in the business, though he eventually moved his family to the New Jersey suburbs and the offices of his construction company to the Bronx. Joseph made good money, building a lot of fast-food franchises. But his kids never felt rich. As a teenager, Mario spent his summers toiling on work sites. He saw enough of the construction business to know that when he got older, he wanted to do something different. In the real estate business, like most industries, the more power you have, the more you are paid. And from where Mario stood, no one had more power than the developer. That is what he set out to become.
 Even within the developer class, however, there are stratifications. Manhattan office-building developers sit on the boards of museums and opera houses. The more visible Manhattan residential developers are flashy downtown types: the former nightclub owner Ian Schrager, for instance, or Andre Balazs, who is known for dating Uma Thurman. Beneath them there is a scurrying subculture of gamblers, big talkers and outright con men, who are regarded by the Establishment with disdain -- not least because many of those in the Establishment were once hustlers themselves. Lower still in the caste system are the smaller players from the outer boroughs. Though many fortunes have been made by building outside Manhattan -- just ask Donald Trump, whose father started out developing working-class apartments in Brooklyn and Queens, or the billionaire Lefrak family, for which Lefrak City, the mammoth Queens housing project, is named -- there's not supposed to be a lot of glory in it. Which may explain why so many developers are asking: Who is this Mario Procida?
 Procida still works where his father did, in an industrial building in the Bathgate section of the Bronx, near the Metro-North tracks. One afternoon in early December, Procida drove me around the neighborhood in his S.U.V., pointing out buildings that had once been abandoned and considered so beyond salvaging that the city administration had painted ersatz curtains on their windows just to maintain the illusion that they were inhabited. Now real people lived in them; the Bronx has rebounded, too. 
 New York's real estate crash of the late 1980s left behind a bloody trail of bankruptcies, empty buildings and depressed prices and ruined nearly everyone in the business. Procida, however, found a way to survive, and even prosper, through the down times. He did it by building for poor people. In partnership with a community group called the Mid-Bronx Desperadoes, he won contracts to build a series of government-subsidized housing projects that were lauded for their innovative architecture. 
 Procida says his development operation is now a $500 million business, but it didn't really take off until the beginning of the decade, when he formed a partnership with Louis Greco, whose family also went way back in the real estate business -- his grandfather was a developer and Mayor Fiorello La Guardia's buildings commissioner. Greco knew his home borough, Brooklyn, as well as Procida knew the Bronx. He also had experience in building luxury housing. In late 2001, at a time when banks were leery about making construction loans in Manhattan because of the threat of terrorism, Greco and Procida secured financing for their first big project, Boulevard East, an 11-story apartment building in downtown Brooklyn. ''We were in a marketplace where the little guys couldn't afford to get into it, because it was too big for them,'' Greco told me when I visited him at his office, in a restored brownstone mansion in Brooklyn Heights. ''And the big guys didn't want to be bothered with it.''
 But the big guys missed something: young professionals, priced out of Manhattan, were discovering the charms of neighborhoods a few subway stops across the river. Originally, Procida and Greco intended to make Boulevard East a rental building, but area housing prices rose so strikingly during the time they were constructing it that they decided to sell the units instead, at reasonable prices. The cover of a glossy sales brochure depicted five good-looking young people walking down Smith Street in a formation that evoked the Beatles' ''Abbey Road'' album cover. The building sold out quickly. 
 ''He had a few deals like that, where the timing was right,'' said Procida's business associate Carlton Brown. ''He was a wizard. And for whatever reason, he decided he wanted to step it up a notch -- or four.'' 
 On Prospect Park, like many real estate developments, was not so much conceived as assembled by chance. The Union Temple of Brooklyn, the borough's oldest Reform Jewish congregation, had a parking lot next to its building on Eastern Parkway. Since the lot faced Grand Army Plaza, the congregation's leadership figured it could fetch a good price in Brooklyn's booming real estate market. Several developers expressed interest, but no one could work out a sale, mostly because the owners of the Eastern Athletic Club, who have an outlet that occupies part of the temple building, had a lease that gave them the right of first refusal on the land. One of the owners of the athletic club, however, knew Louis Greco, having met him a few years before at a concert put on by Elton John and Billy Joel. Procida brought in a third partner, Sheldon Gordon, best known for building shopping malls in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. He'd met Gordon because their children went to school together at Greenwich Academy. After a protracted negotiation, they bought the land for $4.75 million, while promising millions more in additional improvements to the temple and the health club. 
 Originally, Greco and Procida imagined building a traditional brick apartment building on the property, but Gordon was friendly with Richard Meier, who had just built two new buildings in the West Village that were going for unheard-of prices. ''Sheldon, as I remember, said, 'I want to do a good building; I'm putting some money into it, and I don't want to put up any old building,' '' Meier told me. ''This should be as good as the budget will allow.''
 The budget for a Meier building, other developers say, is enormous. Not only are the architect's fees in keeping with his stature, but he also lays out his designs in ways that, while daring from an artistic standpoint, are maddening to cost-conscious builders. ''To get the star-quality architect with the cachet of Richard Meier, you're paying a big premium,'' said Thomas Elghanayan, a developer who is in the process of building seven luxury towers on the waterfront in Long Island City, Queens. ''To do that on Grand Army Plaza -- granted, a primo location, great views -- it takes a lot of guts.''
 ''It's not something I would have done,'' Brown said, ''but that's also the way people make fortunes: by doing things others wouldn't have done.''
 Developers who lived through the last crash talk about it the way old Londoners recount the blitz. They'll tell you there are a million reasons why this boom won't end like that one. Banks are smarter with their lending. The city is growing. Its economy is strong. Goldman Sachs gave out a record $16.5 billion in year-end bonuses. Globalization and America's growing income disparity -- a positive development for builders of luxury housing -- have created a jet-setting class of international plutocrats who think nothing of plunking down $10 million for a Manhattan pied-a-terre. At every juncture when disaster seemed inevitable -- after Sept. 11, after interest rates started rising, after the Miami and Las Vegas markets tanked -- buildings kept bubbling up in New York. In the last year, despite much doomsaying, apartment sale prices have remained roughly stable, prompting talk within the industry of a ''soft landing.''
 ''The question is, is there too much product that will be coming on the market in the next year?'' said Gregory Heym, chief economist at the real estate brokerage firm Brown Harris Stevens. If you press developers, you find that many of the more established ones are worried that the answer is yes. Just as in the late 1980s, a host of new players have come on to the scene, and it seems as if their calculators are programmed differently. ''Everybody became a developer in the last five years, so there are a lot of crappy buildings going up,'' said David Walentas, a major builder on the Brooklyn waterfront. For decades, a city program has offered huge tax breaks to developers who build outside the most desirable Manhattan neighborhoods, an incentive that is passed on to buyers. (The purchaser of On Prospect Park's $6 million penthouse, for instance, who would normally be assessed $3,000 a month in real estate taxes, will initially pay only around $50 a month.) The City Council recently voted to revise the program, so that future buildings in certain fast-growing neighborhoods, like the one around Grand Army Plaza, will have to include units for low- and middle-income people in order to qualify for the tax break. Developers predict that the revision will prompt many in their industry to rush into new construction before the end of the year, when the costly new guidelines go into effect, increasing the potential for a ruinous glut.
 ''Listen, there's a lot of product out there,'' Mario Procida conceded. ''But we don't think that On Prospect Park is sitting in the mix with the majority of product in the market. It is definitely a unique proposition for living in a spectacular location. We feel people will pay a premium for it. We feel they will want to live there.''
 Picking a home is always, in some measure, tied up with the question of ''Who am I?'' The developers of On Prospect Park are trying to sell condominiums by convincing prospective buyers that they are Richard Meier people. ''This building is really about, 'This is who I am, this is where I want to be, this building represents me,' '' Cheryl Nielsen-Saaf, who is handling the marketing of On Prospect Park on behalf of the Corcoran Group real estate brokerage, told me on the phone one day. She invited me to drop by the project's sales gallery to see what she meant. 
 The gallery had opened a month or so before, just in time for the flush Wall Street bonus season. Significantly, it wasn't located in Brooklyn but in a storefront on Leonard Street, in the self-consciously hip Manhattan neighborhood of TriBeCa. ''What we're trying to do is educate the buyer about who Richard Meier really is,'' Nielsen-Saaf said as she led me down a row of black-and-white photographs of the architect and some of his most famous buildings. We walked past an immense glass vase filled with dried fall flowers and into the rear room, where the marketers had constructed a model apartment. The walls were white, the kitchen countertop was white, the cabinets were white, the leather couch was white, the light was dazzling and the fixtures were all from Germany. You got the impression that living in an apartment designed by Richard Meier was a little like residing inside a very spacious, expensively appointed iPod. 
 Meier's own office, located in an old loft building on a windswept stretch of 10th Avenue, is decorated according to a similarly cool and minimalist aesthetic. The architect, now 72, wears his hair -- white, of course -- fashionably long. Meier told me he was taking care to design every element of On Prospect Park, inside and out. He learned a hard lesson about the importance of enforcing his vision when he built his first two West Village buildings. They were a ''disaster from the beginning,'' he said, in terms of the construction process. Breathless stories about their glamorous occupants quickly gave way to gossip items about leaky windows.
 Behind the scenes, Meier's insistence on control has created some tension. ''I've been on that side of the table,'' said Procida, the former architecture student. ''Did you read 'The Fountainhead'? You know, it's 'What I'm designing is the way things should be and the way you should live.' And oftentimes, and this is to a certain extent a generalization, the concept of cost and constructability is not at the top of their list of priorities.'' Developers are accustomed to treating architects the way movie producers treat screenwriters, but Meier's name is on the marquee, so to speak, so he can't easily be pushed around. One person involved in the project related that the developers and the architect had spent ''many, many months'' arguing about baseboards. Meier didn't want them, because they compromised his sleek look, but the developers had visions of maids gouging out chunks of Sheetrock with their vacuum cleaners. Eventually, a mutually agreeable design was worked out. 
 Greco, the member of the development partnership most involved with the marketing strategy, told me that he and Procida believe that applying Meier's name to their condominiums adds roughly 25 percent to their potential sale price. ''In the garment business, you can add a 20 to 30 percent premium for the right label,'' Greco said. ''So it's the same thing here. It's a label.'' 
 The developers' challenge is to keep Meier's design from adding a similar premium to their construction costs. Although apartments are far cheaper in Brooklyn than in Manhattan -- asking prices at On Prospect Park (which range from $790,000 to $6 million) are about half the cost of a unit in one of Meier's Manhattan buildings -- construction contractors offer no similar outer-borough discount. It's as expensive to build next to Prospect Park as it is next to Central Park. To finance the building, Procida and his partners have had to take on an amount of debt that is unusually large for a Brooklyn project. Real estate people measure things by the square foot. The project's construction loans alone amount to about $660 for every salable square foot in the building. That suggests that the bank expects that Procida will sell the units for at least $1,000 a square foot. He is asking for $1,212. But other developers told me that no one else has dared to charge much more than $850 a square foot for new luxury condominiums in Brooklyn. Procida wouldn't disclose how much money he and his partners have invested in the project, but he did say his overall costs are ''well above $700 a square foot.'' If he manages to sell his apartments for something close to their asking price, he and his partners will walk away with tens of millions of dollars. But if Procida finds he can sell his apartments only at the $850 level, like everyone else in Brooklyn, he could have trouble breaking even. 
 In the end, the project's success will depend on whether the marketability of Richard Meier overwhelms the power of that most potent of all real estate forces, location. When I asked Greco who was going to buy at On Prospect Park, he described a species of New Yorker that sounded a lot like a Manhattanite. Someone who had enough money to live anywhere and wanted to live someplace fashionable, with great views, a doorman and an adjacent health club. The sort of person who attended a recent Annie Leibovitz photography exhibition, which the developers partly sponsored. The sort of person, Greco said, who would return from the sales gallery with the clothbound On Prospect Park brochure, place it on his coffee table and proudly tell his friends, ''I'm in a Richard Meier building.''
 It struck me that our conversation was leaving the domain of economic calculation and was entering the far less predictable realm of taste. Greco could figure out how many New Yorkers could afford an apartment at On Prospect Park. Based on housing-market statistics, he could reasonably estimate how many of them might move to Brooklyn. What he couldn't know, because it wasn't quantifiable, was how many of them were Richard Meier people. Recently, there have been some signs that the number of wealthy New Yorkers who want to live inside avant-garde architecture is not limitless. In Manhattan, Meier's third West Village building did not sell out as quickly as the first two, and an undulating blue-green glass tower by Charles Gwathmey, marketed as ''Sculpture for Living,'' has been greeted savagely by the press and indifferently by buyers, to the point that the building's developer has put a few unsold units up for rent. There has been some grumbling among architecture critics -- both the professional and the sidewalk variety -- that all these modish glass buildings are rather uniform in their uniqueness. Some developers wonder if the style will make the transition to Brooklyn, a place where people tend to like bricks. ''I think the Brooklyn buyer is a Brooklynite,'' said Veronica Hackett, managing partner of the Clarett Group, which is building a 108-unit luxury development near the Williamsburgh Savings Bank building.
 The thing is, Mario Procida and his partners don't really know what lies beyond their beautiful edifice. ''You run the numbers, you look to see some economic sense, but ultimately, at the end of the day, you rely on your gut,'' Procida told me that afternoon at his office. A few weeks later, in mid-January, we were talking on the phone, and Procida returned to the subject of uncertainty -- this time in the context of the Miami Beach-style condominiums he built next to the Throgs Neck Bridge, back when he was 27. ''Looking back at it, it was highly out of the box,'' he said. ''It was out of the box stylistically, and it was out of the box for the market. There are a lot of things that everybody just said no to. In many respects it was just as out of the box as when we started a lot of our redevelopment work in what everyone would call the South Bronx. There's a parallel there. People said, no, you can't build houses there. Nobody would lend you the money.''
 When I mentioned his friend Carlton Brown's assessment that On Prospect Park was a ''risky'' proposition, Procida seemed genuinely taken aback. ''We're selling,'' he said, adamantly. ''We've sold in excess of 10 percent of the units. We've sold about 12 units, and we opened, realistically, during the holidays. So we're real happy.'' Since then, the number of apartments under contract has only continued to grow, according to the developers. At this early stage, however, deeds have not yet been filed with the city, so it is impossible to verify those claims or to confirm whether the apartments are selling for a price close to what Procida originally envisioned. He and his partners have already had to adjust their expectations somewhat: in October, according to public documents, they revised the asking prices for roughly half of On Prospect Park's units, reducing them by about 3 percent, or $6.4 million, in aggregate. Several individual apartments were marked down $500,000 or more; one, on the 13th floor, fell in price by $1.35 million. One unit's price tag stood untouched, however: that penthouse costs $6 million. It remains the steepest view in Brooklyn, and it is still available.

HEADLINE: Subsidized Houses for Rich People

BYLINE: By Edward Lewine

 BODY:
Next time you sit down to write your monthly mortgage or rent check, consider this: In Santa Barbara, about 90 miles northwest of Los Angeles, a public-private partnership is planning to build a subsidized-housing development for some families earning as much as $177,000. 
''It does sound unusual,'' admitted Rob Pearson, the executive director of the city's Housing Authority, which helped broker the deal for the development, to be called Los Portales. ''But Santa Barbara is getting Gucci-fied. If we don't do something, we'll lose our middle class.''
 The problem seems to be a matter of supply and demand, made worse by geography and public policy. With its stunning location, vibrant cultural scene and proximity to Los Angeles, Santa Barbara is a hot place to live. But the city is confined by the Pacific Ocean and the Santa Ynez Mountains, and strict zoning means that its 17 square miles are legally almost built out. The nearest affordable town is some 30 miles away.
 City officials say they've worked to provide affordable homes for lower-income residents; about 12 percent of local housing stock falls into this category, much of it subsidized with public money. But with the average median home price in the Santa Barbara area hovering around $1.2 million, many well-employed citizens are finding it tough to buy a home.
 ''It's even problematic for people like doctors,'' says Martha Sadler, a housing reporter for The Santa Barbara Independent weekly newspaper.
 Enter Los Portales. The idea took shape in 2002, when a developer named Jeff Bermant spotted an empty 1.75-acre lot near downtown. The Housing Authority bought the land for $3.5 million with money borrowed at a modest 4.5 percent interest rate from a philanthropic group, the Santa Barbara Foundation.
 Rather than take a percentage, Bermant agreed to build for a fee capped at $2 million. Current plans call for 48 town houses, each with two parking spaces. The two- and three-bedroom units are priced between $495,000 and $595,000, well below market value. No taxpayer dollars will be used. ''I call this a great experiment,'' Bermant says. ''I want to find a way to deliver middle-income housing for a profit.''
 Interested buyers must show income less than 2.7 times Santa Barbara's median income, or $177,660 for a family of four. The target income range for such a family, however, is between $130,000 and $145,000. The plan is for half the units to be sold with preference to people who work in nonprofit groups and for the other half to go to families who meet the income qualification and live or work in the city. The development seems to have local support, and Bermant says he hopes to start construction in September 2008.
 ''This is good for Santa Barbara'' Sadler says. ''Rich people are great, and it's interesting to live with C.E.O.'s. But there are middle-class people who are great, too.'' Edward Lewine

HEADLINE: Down The Middle

BYLINE: By ANNA BERNASEK

 BODY:
For the past few years we've been flooded with national housing-market statistics -- chronicling a boom, predicting a bust. But as any homeowner knows, national numbers don't tell you much about what's happening in the local housing market. For that you have to go deeper. ''What's striking if you look closer is that different patterns emerge,'' says Jonathan J. Miller, chief executive of the New York-based real estate appraisal and consulting firm Miller Samuel Inc. ''In New York, for instance, we're finding bidding wars in some markets and prices dropping in others.'' 
 One way to understand where the housing slump has been hitting is to break the market down according to different price tiers. Judging by local data supplied by brokers (national data don't provide a detailed breakdown), it seems that so far it has struck hardest in the middle. In Miami-Dade County for instance, where condominiums represent about two-thirds of the market and single-family homes one-third, the average price of a condo in the $600,000 to $800,000 range (the middle of the middle tier) was down 1 percent in November 2006 compared with November 2005. At the high end, with most properties ranging from $2 million to $4 million, the average price rose 15 percent over the same period. And at the lower end, for condos between $400,000 and $600,000, the average price rose 2 percent.
The trend is similar in New York. In Manhattan, with its concentration of extremely high-priced properties, the weak middle has been in the range of $2 million to $4 million. Prices of apartments in that range fell an average of 7 percent in November 2006, compared with the previous November. During the same period, the average price of apartments costing more than $10 million rose by 5 percent, and of those under $1 million more than 8 percent. In Chicago, though, the market has been less variable. The average price of a single-family home in the middle -- the $600,000-to-$800,000 range -- fell 1 percent in November 2006, compared with the previous year, while the top (homes above $1 million) also dropped 1 percent. But the bottom end, those properties below $400,000, remained flat. 
 ''Weakness in the market has been concentrated in certain segments,'' says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Economy.com. ''We're not witnessing the entire housing market in metro areas caving in.'' 
 So why is the middle taking the blow? Perhaps because those factors that appear to be causing the slump -- overbuilding and concerns about affordability -- have weighed most heavily on that sector. Demand in the middle-price tiers has been supported by historically low interest rates and resulting high affordability, but not by significant gains in income. As rates began their rise and affordability began to decrease, the demand for housing in the middle price range began to fall.
 Prices at the top, by contrast, have been driven by changes in wealth. In recent years wealth creation in the United States has been spectacular for many at the high end. Fueled by a boom in investment income, low taxes and demand from wealthy foreign buyers, the high end of the housing market has continued to experience strong price gains. ''That's the market where we're seeing bidding wars,'' Miller says. In Miami, for instance, developers are still betting on the high end to perform well. Frank McKinney, a developer of oceanfront properties from Palm Beach to Miami, is going ahead with several single-family home developments priced above $20 million. ''If you look at the ultrawealthy class, it's expanding exponentially,'' he says.
 High-end markets in cities like Chicago, Denver and San Diego have been less robust, but that's because the wealthy in those markets tend to be doctors, lawyers and small entrepreneurs, and they haven't experienced the outsize gains of the very rich who work in fields like finance.
 At the low end, the market has held up well nationwide. But there's an important reason for that, too: the availability of credit. The deciding factor for many first-time home purchasers is not home prices or interest rates; it's whether they can get a mortgage at all. And aggressive lending has been a booming business, allowing even people with a weak credit history or limited resources to borrow to buy a house or apartment.
 That may be about to change, though. A group of regulators, including the Federal Reserve, is expected to announce tighter lending requirements for the sub-prime housing market in coming weeks. ''Anyone could get a loan up until the end of last year,'' says Zandi, the Moody's economist. ''But that's changing rapidly. And that will take the wind out of the sails of the lower end of the market.''
 So watch out. Not too long from now we may be looking at another soft spot.

HEADLINE: Paradise, In Contract

BYLINE: By Somini Sengupta.

 BODY:
One afternoon in December, Roy Patrao peered through a sturdy iron gate and scanned the gnarled roots of a tree embracing the ruin of an old stone house. Only a shell of the house survived, with thick columns holding up a portico. A window shutter made of seashells and slatted wood was visible amid the overgrown bush. On this plot of land, Patrao saw his dream. 
 He would build a villa here, with cool limestone floors and a modern kitchen. The upstairs windows would open to a view of the river that meandered through the village. In the backyard, he pictured a family gathering around the barbecue, as they might on a summer's evening in Southern California, where Patrao once lived. But this time, the domestic scene would take place in Goa, the sliver of a state on India's western coast. 
 The site was perfect. On the adjacent property was a paddy field, which by law was off limits to construction. The river view was a bonus, for in the real estate business, river views are nearly as lucrative as Goa's legendary ocean views, which have become virtually impossible to attain. The village itself, called Aldona, was long on Goan charm, surrounded by rolling hills with the beaches of the Arabian Sea less than an hour's drive away. Across the road from the old house stood a small white chapel. The fishmonger did the rounds each morning. The charm factor was sweetened by local lore: Patrao told me there were tales of two ghost sightings in the house. 
 Patrao hadn't bought the plot yet, but he was already picturing that this would be the first of 10, maybe 20, houses that he would build across Goa. He would use his own money and that of friends, who likewise would be banking on the appeal of Goa's lore. One day, he imagined, a community of Indian-Americans like him might spend holidays in their Goan homes or eventually retire here. He was born in Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay), but when he spoke of homecoming, he meant Goa.
 Goa, like much of India, is in the midst of a real estate frenzy, and Patrao, a man nearly 60, a veteran of the construction business in California and New York, is nothing if not an entrepreneur. His ambitions were fueled as much by his canny business sense as by Goa's enticements. The houses he imagined building would sell for at least $180,000, he reckoned, or more than twice the investment in the land and construction costs. Real estate, he figured, was the way to go in India. ''One billion people. Limited land supply. It's a no-brainer,'' he concluded. 
 With that plan in mind, Patrao and his girlfriend, Sundiv Kaur, known as Sunny, were devoting their days and nights to the quest for land. They drove from village to village, eyeing ruins and plots, inspecting views, making drawings and, in the evenings, plotting their findings on a flowchart to see how well the math worked. 
 Theirs was also a personal venture. Goa is where they both came to recover from their old lives. Both had left their previous marriages -- she in Singapore, he in the United States. They met in Goa, became friends, fell in love, rented an apartment together and decided to put down new roots. One day, they said, they would build themselves a house in Goa. ''This is a second-chance place, baby,'' was Patrao's verdict.
 As Patrao drove through Aldona on the warm December afternoon, Kaur sat next to him, quietly smiling. The next morning, they planned to put down money on their dream ruin. 
 In popular culture, Goa has long embodied qualities hard to find in India -- it is quaint, laid-back, libertine -- and its real estate boom may be more about mythology than location. It is the kind of place, you repeatedly hear, where a woman can go out of the house in shorts, or where people are reasonably tolerant of a situation like Patrao's living with Kaur, who, at 34, is much younger, and not even his wife. An acquaintance of mine in Delhi who owns a house in Goa put it bluntly: If you want to get out of India, come to Goa. 
 Goa has long been a crossroads of East and West. It was conquered by the Portuguese in the early 16th century, just after Vasco da Gama reached India (he landed a bit farther south) and effectively planted the flag for European rule in India. Chilies came to India through Goa, after the Portuguese ferried them from the Americas, and forever changed Indian food. The echoes of Portuguese rule are still felt in the houses with their frescoed walls and wraparound porches. 
 In a 1964 essay called ''Goa the Unique,'' Graham Greene wrote, ''Outside Goa one is aware all the time of the interminable repetition of the ramshackle, the enormous pressure of poverty, flowing, branching, extending like flood water.'' In Goa, he recalled attending a party where he was offered a Benzedrine tablet at 4 a.m.
 Sudhir Kakar, a psychoanalyst and novelist, says that in the Indian mind Goa has long signified freedom, particularly of the sexual kind. It is an association advanced by Hindi movies of another era, he said, in which Goan women were often portrayed as sexually available and Goan men as drunks. ''Goa is associated with free sensuality,'' he said by way of explaining its real estate lure. ''That I think is a very big attraction -- and the keeping up with the Joneses. It's a party place, a place to let go of your inhibitions.'' Kakar himself let go of his two homes -- renting out one in ''aggressive'' Delhi, in his words, the other in ''cold'' Berlin -- and moved to Goa four years ago. He and his wife, Katharina, set about restoring an old Portuguese-era house. 
 The makeover of Goa into an upscale vacation spot -- the Hamptons, if you will, for the upwardly mobile Indian -- began in the late 1960s, when hippies came to conquer Goa's beaches. Over time, it became a mandatory stop on the Israeli post-military-service circuit. A string of five-star resorts opened in the 1990s. Onetime visitors, both Indian and foreign, began restoring old houses. Then, over the past few years, as private airlines added new flights to Goa, affluent urban professionals from Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and elsewhere began coming in droves. The economy was soaring. People suddenly had money to invest. They started buying Goan real estate. 
 The Goa phenomenon has been fueled by India's economic rise. There is more money swirling around than ever before, including more foreign investment for real estate. Drive along any major highway in India and you are likely to see earth being moved day and night, laborers carrying cement on their heads, steel pilings pointing up to the sky like so many skinny fingers of ambition. Once unremarkable small towns now see a rush of high-rise apartment blocks under construction. Erstwhile fields of wheat and mustard are fenced off, with giant billboards announcing the arrival of new townships. 
 There is a genuine demand for some types of development: office buildings are absorbed in cities like Bangalore as quickly as they are built. But there's also a breathless quality to some of the forecasts. One report from Deutsche Bank of Germany predicted in January that 600 malls would be under way across India in the next three years. In recent months, in an apparent effort to temper soaring real estate prices, Indian banks have gradually raised interest rates on home loans. 
 In Goa, the boom started, naturally, with tycoons. Eight years ago, Vijay Mallya, who owns Kingfisher Beer, hired Dean D'Cruz, one of Goa's best-known architects, to design what Mallya dubbed the Kingfisher Villa, spilling down to the Arabian Sea. ''When people walk into my house, I want them to go weak in the knees,'' is how D'Cruz recalled his instructions. 
 Somewhat less wealthy seekers followed, but their real estate fantasies burned just as hot. Gated communities with clubhouses and pools began to go up. Hillsides were carved out for condominiums. Cashew groves were cut for a road. Recently, some of the country's biggest developers have put forward plans for apartments, golf courses, hotels, shopping malls and a software park. 
 Prices have swiftly climbed into the stratosphere. In April of last year, DLF Universal, one of India's largest builders, bought a patch of land near the capital, Panaji, for more than $1,100 a square yard. Just two years ago, the state government, which owned the land, could not dispose of the property for a sixth of that price. DLF plans to build a mall and office complex on the site. 
 This construction has not been greeted with universal joy. Last fall, after the Goan state government approved a five-year regional plan that opened new swaths of land to development, some of it hillsides with coveted views of river and sea, residents of laid-back Goa were roused to action. Builders welcomed the plan as relief from what they deplored as overly stringent restrictions on construction, including a ban on buildings taller than the nearest coconut palm. But critics in Goa, who included D'Cruz, saw it as an open invitation to destruction. Where would all the garbage go? Where was the clean drinking water for all the newcomers when the village wells were running dry or salty? Goa's ecology would be destroyed, the critics cried, its magic would be gone. 
 Protests were organized, and a campaign, called Save Goa, was established. One protest in December drew thousands of people to Panaji. Amateur photographers fanned across the state snapping pictures of supposedly illegal construction. The Catholic Church put its weight behind the campaign. Save Goa took state officials to court. ''Paradise Lost,'' its Web site warned. 
 By mid-January, the campaign could claim a substantial victory. The government of Goa, ruled by the Congress Party, voted to scrap the regional plan and draft a new one. Menino Peres, the director of the department of information and publicity, said it was because of the ''sentiment of large numbers of people in Goa, and on environment and congestion considerations.'' 
 Roy Patrao watched the controversy closely, and not without self-interest. He regarded the debate as unnecessarily polarized. In the anti-development lobby he saw tendencies of Nimby-ism. But during the week of the big protest in Panaji, he sent me an e-mail message saying he was glad he had refrained from big projects and what he called ''controversial lands.'' 
 ''I had a powerful feeling that something smelled here -- and that I did not want to be part of the stench,'' he wrote. ''Having said that, I also believe that many of the luminaries of Goa feel slighted because $(lsquo$)outsiders' want to develop mega-projects in Goa. They want Goa to remain as it always was. I feel they would like to be the ones in charge.'' 
 Spread across 140 acres along a wooded ridge on the edge of the water some 11 miles from Aldona, Aldeia de Goa, a lavish gated community, bears little resemblance to the rest of India. Irvine, Calif., might be a closer cousin. There are no potholes. There are street lamps and around-the-clock water from the tap. Sewage is treated and not left to fester in a septic tank. Terraced lawns lead down to a clubhouse under construction, along with a gym, tennis courts and a swimming pool. A five-star hotel will be built on the beach. Where the ridge bends, a section has been cleared for the construction of another cluster of bungalows and condominiums. The views face west onto the widening mouth of the Zuari River as it pours into the Arabian Sea. 
 The rest of the hill tells you what Aldeia de Goa once was -- shrubs and trees formerly zoned as orchard land where no development was allowed. The developers argued for a rezoning many years ago and managed to relax Goa's strict coastal regulations for the patch of beach where they are putting up the hotel. They convinced local authorities that since the property abuts the mouth of the Zuari, the 200-meter buffer that applies to hotel construction on the seacoast should not apply; they have been allowed to build closer to the water.
 Aldeia is the postcard for a new Indian aspiration -- the country house, which had been the province of Indian blue-blood families, and even for them it meant a cottage in the hills, bought from the departing British. In Aldeia, completed houses can go for as much as $700,000. Prices of bungalow plots have more than doubled in two years. All told, about half of the roughly 250 properties in Aldeia have been bought by people from Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. The rest are Indians who live abroad. ''Invest in the lifestyle you deserve,'' the cover of the sales brochure declares. 
 The owners at Aldeia also include local officials who at one point or another have smoothed the way for building permits and rezoning. Among them is Goa's most famous politician, Atanasio Monserrate, who until recently served as the minister for town and country planning and was a chief architect of the repealed regional plan. One of his most controversial acts of rezoning was to allow for a road to be built through paddy fields in order to connect two of his houses. At Aldeia, he has a corner plot with a prime view of the water. Monserrate declined several requests for an interview, but in December, when a private Indian television news station, NDTV, asked him about charges of graft, Monserrate said flatly that such accusations were impossible to prove. He resigned in January, saying that he had been unfairly blamed for the new regional plan. 
 One afternoon a few months ago, a few miles north of the capital, Dean D'Cruz drove across a narrow bridge and pointed to mangroves that had recently gone up for sale. We were headed to check on a hotel in Calangute that D'Cruz had designed, and along Aguada Bay he showed me a gentle slope that leads down to the water. It had been shaved off, and a new house was under construction; D'Cruz suspected it was a violation of the coastal regulations. 
 As we continued our drive north to Morjim, where there has been a flurry of real estate deals, we saw a bulldozer burrowing a road through a wooded hill. These activities distress many Goans. Kalu Ganesh Shetgaonkar, the 75-year-old patriarch of an extended family of 60 in Morjim, said he regularly wards off buyers and brokers who come to inquire about his property on the hill. There's nothing up there, not even water, Shetgaonkar said -- just cashew trees. ''It's our ancestors' land,'' his son, Ganesh Kalu, injected. ''Why should we sell it? We didn't buy it.''
 As attached as many Goans are to their ancestral lands, the money can't always be so easily declined. Saba Bhiva Shetgaonkar, another Morjim resident, said he was compelled to sell 1,200 square yards of his cashew hills, so poor and indebted had the family become. The sale paid for the weddings of some of his eight daughters. Shetgaonkar said he would have to dispose of another parcel soon, for the weddings of his two youngest daughters. His only consolation was that prices had nearly quadrupled since he last sold.
 As an architect and a Goa native who grew up in Mumbai, D'Cruz has had a front-row seat to the transformation of Goa. A few years ago, he designed a house for a friend from Mumbai, who in turn sold it for a small fortune and asked D'Cruz to design a dozen more. D'Cruz has since built his share of hotels and private houses, even some small apartments. He welcomed the settlers who came to rescue the crumbling Portuguese-era houses. 
 ''It's nice to see people buy in villages, because the old houses are crumbling,'' D'Cruz said. ''A fair number of people restore them nicely. But they don't participate in the community. It helps architecturally. It doesn't necessarily help the community.'' 
 Lately he has also reluctantly come to see tourism as better fuel for Goa's economy than the rush to build private houses. At least, he says, tourism creates a few more jobs. What scares him, he says, is the specter of sprawl on these hills. He sent a text message to my cellphone on the day of a vital court hearing on the regional plan. ''Pray for us,'' he said.
 Roy Patrao and Sunny Kaur were keenly aware of the roiled waters they were entering as they searched for perfect plots on which to build. They would build small. They would win over the neighbors. 
 On the December afternoon I spent with them, having given up finding anything close to the coast, they were in a village not far from Aldona, inspecting an overgrown plot of land that appeared to have been used as a public toilet. 
 ''Roy, you should come see this,'' Kaur called out from the bushes. Through the brush, you could make out a winding river, snaking through paddy fields. The village was still undiscovered, in real estate terms, and so the plot was still reasonably priced -- about $50 a square yard. A dilapidated house that stood next door, Patrao guessed, would go on the market as soon as construction started on this plot. ''It's gentrification,'' he said. ''Remember TriBeCa?'' 
 They drove down to the river. There was a white cross, decorated with a garland of marigold and a daub of yogurt, an emblem of the entangled Christian and Hindu practice common in Goa. 
 As they were learning, Goan real estate was also entangled in its own particular ways. It is not easy to confirm which lands are actually zoned for construction, nor to get a clean title deed, nor even to follow building codes. A local builder told Patrao that if he built by the rules, government inspectors would get mad. ''They make their money from $(lsquo$)mistakes,' '' he told me. 
 That afternoon, they drove on to Aldona, to show me the old house behind the gate. ''The ruin I've got my eye on,'' Kaur said, eyes twinkling. 
 They would reorient the house, turning an overgrown front garden into the backyard. They would keep the portico on the side. The slatted seashell windows, they weren't sure about. They could easily double their investment, they said, even with the bribes they assumed they would need to pay to local officials for building permits. They had already increased their initial bid on the plot. They expected the owner's blessings the next day.
 But then, the reality of Goan real estate hit them. First, their broker told them the owner had chosen another buyer. Then the buyer backed out, because, as Patrao explained, two of the owner's sisters refused to relinquish their claim on the family property. Under Goan law, which dates back to Portuguese times, the sisters could lay claim at any point in their lifetimes, bungling any future owner's plans. Six weeks later, the place was still on the market. The agent said the asking price had nearly doubled. The family, he reckoned, would eventually sell.

I. Report to Duty - 'On My Bed, Naked'
 On the morning of Monday, Jan. 9, 2006, a 21-year-old Army specialist named Suzanne Swift went AWOL. Her unit, the 54th Military Police Company, out of Fort Lewis, Wash., was two days away from leaving for Iraq. Swift and her platoon had been home less than a year, having completed one 12-month tour of duty in February 2005, and now the rumor was that they were headed to Baghdad to run a detention center. The footlockers were packed. The company's 130 soldiers had been granted a weekend leave in order to go where they needed to go, to say whatever goodbyes needed saying. When they reassembled at 7 a.m. that Monday, uniformed and standing in immaculate rows, Specialist Swift, who during the first deployment drove a Humvee on combat patrols near Karbala, was not among them. 
Swift would later say that she had every intention of going back to Iraq. But in the weeks leading up to the departure date, she started to feel increasingly anxious. She was irritable, had trouble sleeping at night, picked fights with friends, drank heavily. ''I was having a lot of little freakouts,'' she told me when I went to visit her in Washington State last summer. ''But I was also ready to go. I was like, 'O.K., I can do this.' ''
 The weekend before the deployment was to start, however, Swift drove south to her hometown, Eugene, Ore., to visit with her mother and three younger siblings. The decision to flee, she says, happened in a split second on Sunday night. ''All my stuff was in the car,'' she recalls. ''My keys were in my hand, and then I looked at my mom and said: 'I can't do this. I can't go back there.' It wasn't some rational decision. It was a huge, crazy, heart-pounding thing.''
 For two days after she failed to report, Swift watched her cellphone light up with calls from her commanders. They left concerned messages and a few angry ones too. She listened to the messages but did not return the calls. Then rather abruptly, the phone stopped ringing. The 54th MP Company had left for Iraq. Swift says she understood then the enormity of what she'd just done.
 For the remainder of that winter, Swift hid out in the Oregon seaside town of Brookings, staying in a friend's home, uncertain whether the Army was looking for her. ''I got all my money out of the bank,'' she told me. ''I never used my credit card, in case they were trying to trace me. It was always hanging over my head.'' At her mother's urging, she drove back to Eugene every week to see a therapist. In April of last year, she finally moved back into her family's home. Then, on the night of June 11, a pair of local police officers knocked on the door and found Swift inside, painting her toenails with her 19-year-old sister. She was handcuffed, driven away and held in the county jail for two nights before being taken back to Fort Lewis, where military officials threatened to charge her with being absent without leave. As Army officials pondered her fate, Swift was assigned a room in the barracks and an undemanding desk job at Fort Lewis.
 Despite the fact that military procedure for dealing with AWOL soldiers is well established -- most are promptly court-martialed and, if convicted, reduced in rank and jailed in a military prison -- Suzanne Swift's situation raised a seemingly unusual set of issues. She told Army investigators that the reason she did not report for deployment was that she had been sexually harassed repeatedly by three of her supervisors throughout her military service: beginning in Kuwait; through much of her time in Iraq; and following her return to Fort Lewis. She claimed too to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, a highly debilitating condition brought on by an abnormal amount of stress. According to the most recent edition of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, used by mental-health professionals to establish diagnostic criteria, PTSD symptoms can include, among other things, depression, insomnia or ''feeling constantly threatened.'' It is common for those afflicted to ''re-experience'' traumatic moments through intrusive, graphic memories and nightmares. 
 Swift's stress came not just from the war and not just from the supposed harassment, she told the investigators, but from some combination of the two. In a written statement to investigators, Swift asserted that her station, Camp Lima, outside Karbala, was hit by mortar attacks almost nightly for the first two months of her deployment. She reported working 16-hour shifts, experiencing the death of a fellow company member in an incident of friendly fire and having a close friend injured in a car bombing. What Swift said distressed her most, however, was a situation that involved her squad leader, the sergeant to whom she directly reported in Iraq. She claimed that he propositioned her for sex the first day the two of them arrived in Iraq and that she felt coerced into having a sexual relationship with him that lasted four months -- the relationship consisting, she said, of his knocking on her door late at night and demanding intercourse. When she finally ended this arrangement, Swift told me, the sergeant retaliated by ordering her to do solitary forced marches from one side of the camp to another at night in full battle gear and by humiliating her in front of her fellow soldiers. (The sergeant could not be reached, but according to an internal Army report, he denied any sexual contact with Swift.) 
 As it often is with matters involving sex and power, the lines are a little blurry. Swift does not say she was raped, exactly, but rather manipulated into having sex -- repeatedly -- with a man who was above her in rank and therefore responsible for her health and safety. (Some victims' advocates use the term ''command rape'' to describe such situations.) Swift says that the other two sergeants -- one in Kuwait and one back home in Fort Lewis, both a couple of ranks above her -- made comments like ''You want to [expletive] me, don't you?'' or when Swift asked where she was to report for duty, responded, ''On my bed, naked.'' 
 In the wake of several sex scandals in the 1990s, the U.S. military has tried to become more sensitive to the presence of women, especially now that they fill 15 percent of the ranks worldwide. There are regular mandated workshops on preventing sexual harassment and assault. Each battalion has a designated Equal Opportunity representative trained to field and respond to complaints. Swift said she initially reported what she characterized as an unwanted relationship with her squad leader in Iraq to her Equal Opportunity representative there, who listened -- she claims -- but did nothing about it. (According to the internal report, the E.O. representative told investigators that he asked Swift if she had a complaint to make but that she declined at the time.) 
 Swift made it clear that since enlisting in the Army when she was 19, she'd grown accustomed to hearing sexually loaded remarks from fellow enlisted soldiers. It happened ''all the time,'' she said. But coming from her superiors, especially far away from the support systems of home and against a backdrop of mortar attacks and the general uncertainties of war, the overtones felt more threatening. ''You can tell another E-4 to go to hell,'' she said, referring to the rank of specialist. ''But you can't say that to an E-5,'' she said, referring to a sergeant. ''If your sergeant tells you to walk over a minefield, you're supposed to do it.'' 
 I went to see Swift last July as I was immersed in a series of interviews with women who'd gone to Iraq and come home with PTSD. I was trying to understand how being a woman fit into both the war and the psychological consequences of war. The story I heard over and over, the dominant narrative really, followed similar lines to Swift's: allegations of sexual trauma, often denied or dismissed by superiors; ensuing demotions or court-martials; and lingering questions about what actually occurred. 
 Swift and I -- along with her mother, Sara Rich -- met at a run-down sushi place in Tacoma, Wash., not far from Fort Lewis. Swift has blond hair, milky skin and clear green eyes, which lend her the vague aspect of a Victorian doll -- albeit a very tough one. She curses freely, smokes Newports and, when she's not in uniform, favors low-cut shirts that show off an elaborate flower tattoo on her chest. ''Suzanne is not some passive little lily,'' explained her mother. ''She's a soldier.'' 
 By midsummer of last year, the two women had settled into a ritual: once a week Rich would pick up her daughter at the base and take her out for a meal, and then the two would check into a nearby Holiday Inn, talking and watching television and finally going to sleep. At 6:30 the following morning, Swift would put on her uniform and Rich would drive her back to Fort Lewis in time to report for work.
 Rich, who is 41, is a social worker who specializes in family therapy and operates with a certain type of mama-bear verve. She was in frequent touch last summer with her daughter's Chicago-based lawyers, who were then negotiating with the Army to get Swift medically discharged for her PTSD so that she could avoid being court-martialed and convicted for going AWOL. In the six weeks since Swift's arrest, Rich marshaled both legal funds and public sympathy for her daughter's defense, largely by tapping into the outrage fulminating inside the antiwar movement. One of Rich's friends from Eugene built a Web site devoted to Suzanne, taking both donations and online signatures for a petition to have her released from the Army without punishment. Someone else started selling T-shirts, tote bags and teddy bears that read ''Free Suzanne'' and ''Suzanne's My Hero'' to benefit the cause. 
 At that point, the hullabaloo was doing little good. A week before I arrived in Washington, the Army's investigation determined that Swift's charges against two of her higher-ups, including the one Swift said demanded sex from her, could not be substantiated because of a lack of evidence. (Both men denied Swift's allegations. By the time the investigation began, in June 2006, her squad leader had already finished his military service, which put him beyond the reach of punishment by the military anyway.) There was a third sergeant against whom Swift filed a formal harassment complaint in the spring of 2005, nearly a year before she went AWOL. In it she maintained that immediately following her unit's return from Iraq, he began making frequent suggestive remarks to her and at one point, during the course of a normal workday, ''grinded'' his body against hers in an inappropriate way. That man received a stridently worded letter of reprimand on May 25, 2005, from a lieutenant colonel and was transferred away from Fort Lewis. 
 What still remained to be determined was whether Swift would be held accountable for going AWOL or whether the Army would accept the idea that her failure to report was, as she saw it, an instinctive act of psychological self-preservation. Whatever the case, Swift was quickly becoming a symbol -- though of what it was hard to say. Among the antiwar crowd, thanks in part to the fiery speeches Swift's mother was delivering at local rallies and antiwar gatherings, she was being painted as a martyr, a rebel and a victim all at once. Meanwhile, others deemed her a traitor, a fraud or simply a whiny female soldier who'd been too lazy or too selfish to return to war.
 Swift herself seemed stunned by the attention. ''Look at me, a poster child,'' she told me wryly, making it clear that she was not enjoying it. She did not make the kind of grandiose anti-military statements her mother did but rather seemed to be trying to shrug off what happened to her. She told me she was having nightmares and was sometimes waylaid by fits of hysterical crying. But she described these flatly, seeming almost unwilling or unable to express anger or hurt. Overall, she seemed strikingly detached. 
 I had read enough about PTSD to know that ''emotional numbing'' is one of the disorder's primary symptoms, but it made understanding Swift and what she'd been through a more difficult task. ''Avoidance'' is another commonly recognized symptom in people with PTSD, especially avoidance of those things that bring reminders of the original trauma. If the Iraq war and the men she encountered there and afterward traumatized Swift, then perhaps going AWOL could be seen as a sort of meta-avoidance of all that plagued her. 
 That night after dinner, Swift lay on her hotel bed with her shoes kicked off, staring blankly at the ceiling. She was thoughtful and willing to answer questions. A few times, describing her deployment, she hovered close to tears but then seemed promptly to swallow them. She told me that she came home from Iraq feeling demoralized and depressed. She resumed her stateside duties with the Army for the 11 months between deployments and in general ''just tried to deal.''
 She was not, however, formally given a diagnosis of PTSD until after she went AWOL -- first by a civilian psychiatrist within days of her failure to report for deployment and later, Swift says, through the Army's mental-health division at Fort Lewis. (The Army could not confirm this, citing privacy issues.) The timing raised a serious question: Was the PTSD a legitimate disability or a hastily crafted excuse for skipping out on the war? Nobody, perhaps not even Swift, could say for sure. II. The 'Double Whammy'
 No matter how you look at it, Iraq is a chaotic war in which an unprecedented number of women have been exposed to high levels of stress. So far, more than 160,000 female soldiers have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, as compared with the 7,500 who served in Vietnam and the 41,000 who were dispatched to the gulf war in the early '90s. Today one of every 10 U.S. soldiers in Iraq is female.
 Despite the fact that women are generally limited to combat-support roles in the war, they are arguably witnessing a historic amount of violence. With its baffling sand swirl of roadside bombs and blind ambushes, its civilians who look like insurgents and insurgents who look like civilians, the Iraq war has virtually eliminated the distinction between combat units and support units in the military. ''Frankly one of the most dangerous things you can do in Iraq is drive a truck, and that's considered a combat-support role,'' says Matthew Friedman, executive director of the National Center for PTSD, a research-and-education program financed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. ''You've got women that are in harm's way right up there with the men.'' 
 There have been few large-scale studies done on the particular psychiatric effects of combat on female soldiers in the United States, mostly because the sample size has heretofore been small. More than one-quarter of female veterans of Vietnam developed PTSD at some point in their lives, according to the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Survey conducted in the mid-'80s, which included 432 women, most of whom were nurses. (The PTSD rate for women was 4 percent below that of the men.) Two years after deployment to the gulf war, where combat exposure was relatively low, Army data showed that 16 percent of a sample of female soldiers studied met diagnostic criteria for PTSD, as opposed to 8 percent of their male counterparts. The data reflect a larger finding, supported by other research, that women are more likely to be given diagnoses of PTSD, in some cases at twice the rate of men.
 Experts are hard pressed to account for the disparity. Is it that women have stronger reactions to trauma? Do they do a better job of describing their symptoms and are therefore given diagnoses more often? Or do men and women tend to experience different types of trauma? Friedman points out that some traumatic experiences have been shown to be more psychologically ''toxic'' than others. Rape, in particular, is thought to be the most likely to lead to PTSD in women (and in men, in the rarer times it occurs). Participation in combat, though, he says, is not far behind. 
 Much of what we know about trauma comes primarily from research on two distinct populations -- civilian women who have been raped and male combat veterans. But taking into account the large number of women serving in dangerous conditions in Iraq and reports suggesting that women in the military bear a higher risk than civilian women of having been sexually assaulted either before or during their service, it's conceivable that this war may well generate an unfortunate new group to study -- women who have experienced sexual assault and combat, many of them before they turn 25. 
 A 2003 report financed by the Department of Defense revealed that nearly one-third of a nationwide sample of female veterans seeking health care through the V.A. said they experienced rape or attempted rape during their service. Of that group, 37 percent said they were raped multiple times, and 14 percent reported they were gang-raped. Perhaps even more tellingly, a small study financed by the V.A. following the gulf war suggests that rates of both sexual harassment and assault rise during wartime. The researchers who carried out this study also looked at the prevalence of PTSD symptoms -- including flashbacks, nightmares, emotional numbing and round-the-clock anxiety -- and found that women who endured sexual assault were more likely to develop PTSD than those who were exposed to combat. 
 Patricia Resick, director of the Women's Health Sciences Division of the National Center for PTSD at the Boston V.A. facility, says she worries that the conflict in Iraq is leaving large numbers of women potentially vulnerable to this ''double whammy'' of military sexual trauma and combat exposure. ''Many of these women,'' she says, ''will have both.'' She notes that though both men and women who join the military have been shown to have higher rates of sexual and physical abuse in their backgrounds than the general population, women entering the military tend to have more traumas accumulated than men. One way to conceptualize this is to imagine that each one of us has a psychic reservoir for holding life's traumas, but by some indeterminate combination of genetics and socioeconomic factors, some of us appear to have bigger reservoirs than others, making us more resilient. Women entering the military with abuse in their backgrounds, Resick says, ''may be more likely to have that reservoir half full.'' 
 Over the last few years, I've spoken at length with more than a dozen trauma specialists, questioning them about the effect this war will have on the psyches of the women who have fought in it. The prevailing answer is ''We just don't know yet.'' The early reports for both sexes, though, are troubling. The V.A. notes that as of last November, more than one-third of the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan treated at its facilities were given diagnoses of a mental-health disorder, with PTSD being the most common. So far, the V.A. has diagnosed possible PTSD in some 34,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans; nearly 3,800 of them are women. Given that PTSD sometimes takes years to surface in a veteran, these numbers are almost assuredly going to grow. With regard to women, nearly every expert I interviewed mentioned the reportedly high rates of sexual harassment and assault in the military as a particular concern.
 The Department of Defense in recent years has made policy changes designed to address these issues. In 2005 it established a formal Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program, and trains ''Victim Advocates'' on major military installations. The rules have also been rewritten so that victims are now able to report sexual assaults confidentially in ''restricted reports'' that give them access to medical treatment and counseling without setting off an official investigation. The results could be viewed as both encouraging and disturbing: comparing figures from 2005, when the restricted reporting began, to those of 2004, the number of reported assaults across the military jumped 40 percent, to 2,374. While victims may be feeling more empowered to report sexual assault, it appears that the number of assaults are not diminishing. 
 If Suzanne Swift's why-bother approach to telling her superiors about the harassment in Iraq initially struck me as curious, it began to make more sense as I spoke with a number of other female Iraq veterans. There was a pervasive sense among them that reporting a sexual crime was seldom worthwhile. Department of Defense statistics seem to bear this out: of the 3,038 investigations of military sexual assault charges completed in 2004 and 2005, only 329 -- about one-tenth -- of them resulted in a court-martial of the perpetrator. More than half were dismissed for lack of evidence or because an offender could not be identified, and another 617 were resolved through milder administrative punishments, like demotions, transfers and letters of admonishment. 
 Unaware of the actual numbers, many of the women I talked to seemed, in any event, to have soaked up a larger message about the male-dominated military culture. ''Saying something was looked down upon,'' says Amorita Randall, who served in Iraq in 2004 with the Navy, explaining why she did not report what she says was a rape by a petty officer at a naval base on Guam shortly before she was deployed to Iraq. ''I don't know how to explain it. You just don't expect anything to be done about it anyway, so why even try?''III. The Pressure of Being a Woman
 Many of the women I spoke with said they felt the burden of having to represent their sex -- to defy stereotypes about women somehow being too weak for military duty in a war zone by displaying more resiliency and showing less emotion than they otherwise might. There appears to have been little, too, in the way of female bonding in the war zone: most reported that they avoided friendships with other women during the deployment, in part because of the fact that there were fewer women to choose from and in part because of the ridicule that came with having a close friend. ''You're one of three things in the military -- a bitch, a whore or a dyke,'' says Abbie Pickett, who is 24 and a combat-support specialist with the Wisconsin Army National Guard. ''As a female, you get classified pretty quickly.'' 
 Many women mentioned being the subject of crass jokes told by male soldiers. Some said that they used sarcasm to deflect the attention but that privately the ridicule wore them down. Others described warding off sexual advances again and again. ''They basically assume that because you're a girl in the Army, you're obligated to have sex with them,'' Suzanne Swift told me at one point.
 There were women, it should be noted, who spoke of feeling at ease among the men in their platoons, who said their male peers treated them respectfully. Anecdotally, this seemed most common among reserve and medical units, where the sex ratios tended to be more even. Several women credited their commanders for establishing and enforcing a more egalitarian climate, where sexual remarks were not tolerated. 
 This was not the case for Pickett, who arrived in Iraq early in 2003, having been sexually assaulted, she said, during a humanitarian deployment to Nicaragua less than two years earlier, when she was just 19. When I spoke to her by phone in December, she recalled being too afraid to report the incident, particularly given the fact that the supposed perpetrator was an officer who ranked above her. During her 11-month stint in Iraq, stationed mostly outside Tikrit in a company of 19 women and 140 men, Pickett claimed her male peers thought nothing of commenting on her breast size or making sexual jokes about her. She regularly encountered porn magazines sitting in the latrines and in common areas. None of this behavior was particularly new to her; it was life as she knew it in the military. Yet in a war zone the effect seemed more corrosive. ''The real difference is that over there, there's never a break from it,'' Pickett told me. ''At home, you can go out with your girlfriends and get a beer and talk about the idiots who were cracking jokes. Over there, you're a minority 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You never get that 10 minutes to relax or even cry. Sometimes you just need to let it all out.''
 One night in the fall of 2003, Pickett recalled, her unit endured a mortar attack. Trained as a combat lifesaver, she spent part of the night tending to bleeding soldiers by flashlight in a field tent. Once the experience was over, the memory kept replaying in her mind. ''For a long time, I wished I had died that night,'' Pickett told me, adding that she returned to her home in Wisconsin and was ''barely functioning''-- unable to sleep or concentrate. She spent days alone inside her apartment, not talking to anyone. ''I was draining everyone around me,'' she says. A year after her deployment, a V.A. clinician formally diagnosed PTSD, which Pickett says she thinks stems from the stress of combat, harassment and the earlier sexual assault. 
 If Vietnam became notorious as a war that combined violence and sex, with Southeast Asian brothels being the destination of choice for soldiers on temporary leave from the war, the sexual politics of the Iraq war are, as of yet, unclear. 
 Joane Nagel, a sociology professor at the University of Kansas, is studying sex and the military as it pertains to the Iraq war. What she has found, she told me recently, is that ''when you take young women and drop them into that hypermasculine environment, the sex stuff just explodes. Some have willing sex. Some get coerced into it. Women are vulnerable sexually.'' 
 The specter of childhood abuse in military men and women potentially adds another layer of combustibility to gender relations. Tina Lee, a psychiatrist at the V.A. Palo Alto Health Care System in California, works with both male and female PTSD patients. She points out that traumatic experiences in childhood may increase the risk of developing PTSD when exposed to another trauma in adulthood. Experiencing childhood trauma can also produce opposing behaviors in adult men and women. Male survivors of childhood abuse are more likely to act aggressively and angrily, while some women appear to lose their self-protective instincts. A female patient, she says, once offered up an apt description of this tendency to end up in hurtful situations, saying that her ''people picker'' had been broken.
 ''So you have young women joining the military who have the profile of being victimized, who don't have boundaries sometimes,'' Lee went on to say. ''And then you have a male population that fits a perpetrator profile. They are mostly under 25, often developmentally adolescent, and you put them together. What do you think will happen? ... The men do the damage, and the women get damaged.''
 Being sexually assaulted by a fellow soldier may prove extra-traumatic, as it represents a breach in the hallowed code of military cohesion -- a concept that most enlistees have drilled into them from the first day of boot camp. ''It's very disconcerting to have somebody who is supposed to save your life, who has your back, turn on you and do something like that,'' says Susan Avila-Smith, the director of Women Organizing Women, an advocacy program designed to help traumatized women navigate the vast V.A. health-care and benefits system. ''You don't want to believe it's real. You don't want to have to deal with it. The family doesn't want to deal with it. Society doesn't want to deal with it.''
 Pickett, who since returning from Iraq has become active in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a nonpartisan advocacy group, says she believes that the stress of just worrying about this puts a woman in danger. ''When I joined the military, a lot of people at home said things like, 'Oh, are you really going to be able to handle it?' '' she said. ''So then you're in Iraq, driving down Highway 1 with an M-16 in your hand. You have those doubts people had about you in the back of your head. You're thinking 5,000 things at once, trying to be everything everybody wants you to be. And you still have to take the crap from the men. You're 20 years old and growing into your own body, having an actual sex drive. But you've got 30 horny guys propositioning you and being really disgusting about it.'' She added: ''Women are set up to fail in a very real way, in an area where they could get killed. If your mind isn't 100 percent on the battlefield, you could die. That's the bottom line.''IV. Flickers of a Larger Fire
 Three years ago, while researching an article for this magazine on injured soldiers who fought in Iraq, I happened to have a phone conversation with a woman from Michigan who served as a reservist in the gulf war. Like many people, she'd been watching coverage of the war in Iraq with concern. At the time, I was focused on the early waves of soldiers returning home with horrendous, debilitating injuries -- the amputees, the paraplegics, the brain-injured -- but she was worried about something entirely different, equally devastating but far less visible.
 She used her own story as an example: While serving in a mostly male reserve unit in Kuwait, she told me, she was sexually assaulted. After returning home to Michigan, she began exhibiting symptoms of PTSD -- jumpiness, intrusive thoughts and nightmares -- and promptly went to her local V.A. hospital for help. She was then put into group therapy -- which has long been shown to be an economical and reasonably effective way of helping trauma survivors process their experiences -- but her ''group'' was made up entirely of male Vietnam vets, some of whom were trying to work through sex crimes they committed during military service. Others came home from war and beat their wives. ''I freaked out,'' the female reservist told me. ''It sent me into a complete tailspin.''
 She began to drink heavily. She lost her job, moved away from her family and toyed with the idea of suicide. Few PTSD stories are happy stories, but this one eventually took a positive turn: a therapist at her local V.A. hospital finally referred her to a 10-bed residential program for women with PTSD located in Menlo Park, Calif. Desperate for help, she spent a number of weeks there, receiving daily therapy and learning coping skills in the company of a small group of other female veterans and a staff of mostly female therapists. The experience, she told me, saved her life.
 Following the early coverage of the Iraq war, however, she was feeling her PTSD begin to stir again. Jessica Lynch -- who, it was reported, might have been sexually assaulted as a prisoner of war in the first weeks after the invasion -- was being celebrated as a hero. TV news reports showed female soldiers bidding farewell to their spouses and children. All this woman in Michigan could think about, though, was what things would look like on the other side, whether the V.A. would know what to do with these women if they later turned up needing help -- whether, in particular, sexual-assault victims would be retraumatized trying to find their way in a system that was built almost entirely around the needs of men. 
 Thomas Berger, national chairman of Vietnam Veterans of America's PTSD-and-substance-abuse committee, told me recently: ''I think women are more likely to fall through the cracks. The fact is, if a woman veteran comes in from Iraq who's been in a combat situation and has also been raped, there are very few clinicians in the V.A. who have been trained to treat her specific needs.''
 As the Iraq war creates tens of thousands of female war veterans, surely we will begin to know more about the impact of PTSD on the life of a military woman. Female soldiers have flown fighter jets, commanded battalions, lost limbs, survived stints as P.O.W.'s, killed insurgents and also come home in flag-covered caskets. And many, too, have begun to experience the psychic fallout of war, a concept made famous post-Vietnam by a generation of now middle-aged men. ''We're much more willing to acknowledge what guys do in combat -- both the negative and the heroic,'' says Erin Solaro, author of the 2006 book ''Women in the Line of Fire.'' ''But as a culture, we're not yet willing to do that for women. Female combat vets tend to be very lonely people.''
 Sexual trauma by itself or in combination with combat stands to isolate a female vet further, says Avila-Smith, the veterans' advocate. ''If you're in combat, you can talk about it in group therapy,'' she told me. ''You can say, 'Yeah, I was in this battle and I saw my friends blown up,' '' she says. ''But nobody raises their hand and yells out in the middle of the V.A.: 'Yeah, I was raped in the military, was anybody else? Do we have something in common?' '' 
 Avila-Smith herself says she was sexually assaulted while stationed in Texas in 1992 and developed PTSD as a result. For a long time, everyday functioning was a challenge. ''For two years I had a list on my bathroom mirror to brush my teeth, brush my hair, wash my face,'' she said as we sat at a sunny picnic table outside a V.A. hospital in Seattle. ''Every morning it was like waking up in a new world. How did I get here? What's going on? Why is my brain not working?''
 This kind of bewilderment is something I encountered again and again, talking to more than 30 military women who struggle with PTSD. Whether they had just returned from Iraq or were 25 years past their service, whether they'd been sexually assaulted, seen combat or both, most reported feeling forgetful and unfocused, alienated from their own minds. 
 Keli Frasier, an Army reservist living in Clifton, Colo., who said she did not experience sexual assault, told me that because of some combination of anxiety and memory loss, she'd been fired from three low-wage jobs and dropped out of college since returning from Iraq in May 2004. Like a few of the others I met, Frasier always kept a notebook close by to jot down things she was afraid she'd forget. ''Half the time,'' she said, sounding genuinely confused, ''I don't understand why I lose the jobs.'' According to her account, while driving a fuel truck in Iraq, she watched her squad leader die in a roadside ambush and another peer have his leg blown off with a grenade. ''In all those situations, your mind just goes on autopilot, and you just do what you're trained to do,'' she said, sitting on a couch in a warmly decorated trailer she and her husband own. She bounced her 8-month-old son on one knee as she talked. ''I didn't really start having any mental issues until we got home,'' she said, adding that it was four or five months before PTSD was diagnosed by a V.A. counselor. 
 Research has shown that exposure to trauma has the potential to alter brain chemistry, affecting among other things the way memories are processed and stored. To vastly simplify a complex bit of neurology: If the brain can't make sense of a traumatic experience, it may be unable to process it and experience it as a long-term memory. Traumas tend to persist as emotional -- or unconscious -- memories, encoded by the amygdala, the brain's fear center. A trauma can then resurface unexpectedly when triggered by a sensory cue. The cerebral cortex, where rational thought takes place, is not in control. The fear center rules; the brain is overwhelmed. Small tasks -- tooth-brushing, grocery-shopping, feeding your children -- start to feel monumental, even frightening. 
 ''I was not scared a single day I was in Iraq; that's what baffles me most,'' Kate Bulson, a 24-year-old former Army sergeant, told me by phone not long ago from her home in Muskegon, Mich. She developed PTSD after completing the first of two tours in Iraq, she said, adding that she had not experienced sexual trauma. ''I did everything the male soldiers did: I kicked in doors, searched people and cars, ran patrols on dangerous highways,'' she said. ''Over there, I would hear an explosion at night and sleep through it. Now I hear the slightest sound and I wake up.''
 Just last month, The Journal of the American Medical Association published the results of a study sponsored by the V.A., which endorsed the use of ''prolonged exposure therapy'' in treating female veterans with PTSD. The process calls for a patient to visit and revisit traumatic memories in order to lessen their power over the mind. ''It becomes an organized story rather than a fragmented story,'' says Edna Foa, who directs the Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety at the University of Pennsylvania and is considered a pioneer in trauma treatment. ''They are able to put things together. They find all kinds of new perspectives to look at what happened to them.''
 Across the V.A., there appears to be an earnest recognition of the need for stepping up these innovative programs for veterans of both sexes. V.A.-financed researchers are working on everything from testing a drug normally used to treat tuberculosis on PTSD patients to developing virtual-reality war simulations that are meant to give veterans more emotional control over their traumatic memories. Of the some 1,400 V.A. hospitals and clinics, currently only 27 house inpatient PTSD programs, and of these, just 2 serve women exclusively. According to the V.A., several more women's residential treatment programs are in the planning stages.
 Despite fighting wars in two far-off countries, the Bush administration recently announced that while it will increase V.A. health-care financing by 9 percent for 2008, it has proposed consecutive cuts of about $1.8 billion for 2009 and 2010. Moreover, as recent revelations of poor patient care at the military's flagship facility, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, have demonstrated, a federal health-care system built to serve soldiers and veterans is sagging under the load of those who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, a significant number of whom struggle with mental-health issues. The V.A. currently has a reported backlog of 400,000 benefits claims, which can in turn lead to long waits for appointments or for approval for medications. When I met her in January, Keli Frasier, the Army reservist, described herself as ''really having a hard time'' but had been waiting two months to get an appointment to have an expired antidepressant prescription renewed.
 It's possible, too, that female veterans suffer from more invisibility. Patricia Resick, at the Boston V.A. hospital, says she feels that women may perhaps take longer than men to recognize their symptoms and find their way into treatment. ''They're more likely to have a primary parenting role,'' she told me. ''When they get home, they're going to be trying to get back into their families, to re-establish their relationships.'' Lee, the psychiatrist in Palo Alto, says that in her experience, men are more likely to have been encouraged to seek help, usually by their spouses. ''You don't hear as much about husbands saying, 'Honey, why don't you go into residential treatment for two months?' '' she says. And those who feel shame following a sexual trauma, Lee went on to say, may keep it hidden from their health-care providers anyway.
 The larger question is: How will this new crop of female war veterans respond, recover or act out the traumas of their military experience? While it is still too early to know, paying attention to small stories, usually tucked inside local newspapers, may indicate the early flickers of a larger fire. There is the story of Tina Priest, a 21-year-old soldier who, according to Army investigation records, shot herself with an M-16 rifle in Iraq last March, two weeks after filing a rape charge against a fellow soldier and days after being given a diagnosis of ''acute stress disorder consistent with rape trauma.'' (The Army says that a subsequent investigation failed to substantiate the rape claim.)
 There is the story of Linda Michel, a 33-year-old Navy medic who served under stressful conditions at a U.S.-run prison near Baghdad and was given Paxil for depression during the deployment. Returning home last October, she struggled to fit back into her life as a suburban mother of three in a quiet housing development outside of Albany. She shot and killed herself within three weeks of the homecoming. Her husband, also an Iraq veteran, wondered aloud to a reporter with The Albany Times-Union: ''Why wasn't she sent to a facility to resolve the issues?''
 More recently, there's Jessica Rich, a 24-year-old former Army reservist who one night early last month climbed drunk into her Volkswagen Jetta and drove south on a northbound interstate outside of Denver. She slammed head-on into a sport-utility vehicle, killing herself and slightly injuring four others. After a nine-month tour of Iraq in 2003 -- and according to former soldiers who'd been in group therapy with her, having been raped during her service -- PTSD was diagnosed. Her friends say she never got past those experiences. ''She was having nightmares still, up until this point -- flashbacks and anxiety and everything,'' one told The Denver Post. ''She said it was really hard to get over because she couldn't get any help from anybody.'' V. 'What's wrong with Me?'
 Earlier this winter, hoping to understand more about PTSD and its effects, I visited a couple of female Iraq vets who felt their postwar lives had been shaped -- if not temporarily ruined -- by the ''double whammy'' of combat and sexual stress. Both happened to live in Colorado, though each had deployed to war through units located in other states. I met Keri Christensen one morning at her home in a tidy subdivision outside of Denver, where she recently relocated from Wisconsin with her husband and two daughters. She had just taken her daughters to school, and her husband was away on a business trip.
 Christensen is 33, blue-eyed and outwardly perky, with an easy smile. By the time she was deployed to war in 2004, she had finished 13 years of part-time service in the Wisconsin Army National Guard as a heavy-equipment transporter. Prior to her deployment in Iraq, she loved her role in the military. ''Before we were married, my husband was in awe of it,'' she said, laughing. ''He was like, 'I met this girl and she hauls tanks!' '' She added that she was good at what she did, receiving several awards over the years. Beyond commitment to the Guard of one weekend a month and two weeks' training each summer, Christensen spent the previous six years as a stay-at-home mom. Her life, she said, had been a generally happy one.
 But the stresses of deployment were surprisingly manifest: she agonized over leaving her daughters, who were then 6 and 2 years old. Stationed in Kuwait, Christensen's unit ran convoys of equipment back and forth from the port to inside Iraq. ''It was really scary,'' she said, explaining that her convoy had been mortared during an early mission. ''But it was like, Hey cool, we're on a mission.'' Then one day in February 2005, Christensen was accidentally dragged beneath a truck trailer and run over, breaking a number of bones in her foot and injuring her knee and back. She was assigned to a desk job in a tent in Kuwait, mostly working the night shift. It was there, she said, that a sergeant above her in her command -- a man she'd known for 10 years -- began making comments about her breasts and at one point baldly propositioned her for sex. 
 Something inside of her broke, she said. Christensen claims that she was punished for even mentioning the situation to her company commanders -- written up for minor infractions; accused, she says falsely, of being intoxicated (for which she was demoted); and reassigned for duty to an airfield near a mortuary, where she occasionally helped load coffins of dead soldiers onto planes bound for the U.S. (The Wisconsin Army National Guard denied that Christensen was punished for making a sexual-harassment claim and stated that the claim was investigated and dismissed for lack of evidence.) Christensen says that a combination of war stress, harassment and the reprisals that followed were so upsetting and demoralizing that she considered suicide on several occasions. Her military records show that during her deployment, she was given a diagnosis of depression and PTSD. 
 After Christensen's experiences in Kuwait, she allowed her military enlistment to expire, which given that she was six years short of receiving military retirement benefits, only added to her pain. ''That was my career, and they stole it from me,'' she said, sitting on an overstuffed couch in the family room of her home, idly fiddling with one of her children's stuffed animals as she spoke. ''They make you feel like you're crazy. And I'm not just the only one. There's other women out there this has happened to. Why is the attitude always 'Just shut up and leave it alone'?''
 Christensen had been home from war then for just over a year, having returned to her life as a stay-at-home mother, yet she could not shake what the deployment had done to her -- the accident, the confusion and shame of her sexual harassment, and then what she felt was an ignominious demotion and marginalization after reporting the incidents. And while there are those whose image of PTSD is still tied to Vietnam War movies -- the province of men who earned their affliction only after having their best buddies die in their arms in a gush of blood -- Christensen shares the same diagnosis. That is to say that no matter what constituted her war experience, the aftermath was much the same. She suffered from severe headaches and forgetfulness. ''I feel like I'm always forgetting something,'' she said. ''I leave the house and I don't know if I've left something on -- the stove or a candle. I can't trust my memory.'' She told me that her 8-year-old, Madison, recently had to tell her the family's new phone number. She'd lost friends and had ''rough spots'' with her husband. Afraid of crowds, she started grocery shopping at 6 in the morning and was having her mother buy clothes for her children. Driving, too, made her fearful, since she felt ''foggy'' and more than once ran a stop sign or a red light with her kids in the car. Though she went for counseling and medical treatment at a local V.A. while living in Illinois after she returned from Iraq, Christensen had not yet found her way to the Denver V.A. for treatment. The thought of getting in her car and making the 20-minute drive petrified her. 
 Describing it, Christensen began to cry, wringing the stuffed animal in her hands. ''What's wrong with me?'' she said, more to herself than to me. ''I have nightmares of being trapped underneath a trailer with body parts falling on me.'' Her body heaved with sobs as she continued: ''Once when my kids were sleeping with me, I woke up suddenly, thinking it was an Iraqi person, and I almost tossed my kid across the room.'' VI. 'Nothing Is Ever Clear'
 Amorita Randall lives across the state from Christensen, in a small town outside of Grand Junction. She is 27, a former naval construction worker who served in Iraq in 2004. Over the course of several phone conversations before visiting her in January, I grew accustomed to the way Randall coexisted with her memories. Mostly she inched up to them. On days she was feeling stable, she would want to talk, calling me up and abruptly jumping into stories about her six years in the Navy, describing how she was raped twice -- the second rape supposedly taking place just a matter of weeks before she arrived in Iraq. Her experience in Iraq, she said, included one notable combat incident, in which her Humvee was hit by an I.E.D., killing the soldier who was driving and leaving her with a brain injury. ''I don't remember all of it,'' she told me when I met her in the sparsely furnished apartment she shares with her fiance. ''I don't know if I passed out or what, but it was pretty gruesome.''
 According to the Navy, however, no after-action report exists to back up Randall's claims of combat exposure or injury. A Navy spokesman reports that her commander says that his unit was never involved in combat during her tour. And yet, while we were discussing the supposed I.E.D. attack, Randall appeared to recall it in exacting detail -- the smells, the sounds, the impact of the explosion. As she spoke, her body seemed to seize up; her speech became slurred as she slipped into a flashback. It was difficult to know what had traumatized Randall: whether she had in fact been in combat or whether she was reacting to some more generalized recollection of powerlessness. 
 Either way, the effects seemed to be crippling. She lost at least one job and was, like a number of the women I spoke to, living on monthly disability payments from the V.A. Her fiance, an earnest construction worker named Greg Lund, at one point discovered her hidden in a closet in the apartment they share, curled in the fetal position, appearing frozen. ''It scared the hell out of me,'' he said. ''I'm like, am I in over my head here?' '' On another occasion, shopping with Randall at Lowe's, he had to pull her away from a Hispanic man she mistook for an Iraqi. ''She was going to attack him,'' Lund said. ''She was calling him 'the enemy' and stuff like that.'' The biggest tragedy for her was that her daughter, Anne, who is 4, was taken from her custody by the Colorado child-welfare authorities after she was found playing in the road unsupervised one day last June. At the time, Randall and her daughter were living with another family in a halfway house. Randall was inside folding laundry, believing -- she said -- that Anne was being watched by older children in the other family. 
 There were days when Randall couldn't remember things, telling me her mind felt fuzzy. Accordingly, when she broached a subject that was difficult, her speech would slow down markedly and sometimes stop altogether. ''Nothing is ever clear,'' she explained. ''Sometimes I'll just have feelings. Sometimes I'll have pictures. Sometimes it'll be both.'' Her confusion could be both literal and moral. She blamed herself, in part, for the rapes, saying she felt peer pressure to drink heavily in the Navy, which made her more vulnerable. 
 Randall's life story was a sad one, though according to the V.A. psychologists I spoke with, it was not atypical. Growing up in Florida, she said, she was physically and sexually abused by two relatives -- a condition that has been shown to make a woman more prone to suffer assault as an adult. Eventually she landed in foster care. She told me she joined the Navy at 20 precisely because she was raised in an environment where ''girls were worthless.'' The stability and merit structure of the military appealed to her. Stationed in Mississippi in early 2002, Randall said, she was raped one night in her barracks after being at a bar with a group of servicemen. The details are unclear to her, but Randall says she believes that someone drugged her drink. 
 A couple of months later, she discovered she was pregnant. In November 2002, she gave birth to her daughter. Less than a year later, Randall's unit was deployed to the war, stopping first for several months on Guam. She put Anne in the care of a cousin in Florida. The second rape happened after another night of drinking. ''I couldn't fight him off,'' Randall says. ''I remember there were other guys in the room too. Somebody told me they took pictures of it and put them on the Internet.'' Randall says she has blocked out most of the details of the second rape -- something else experts say is a common self-protective measure taken by the brain in response to violent trauma -- and that she left for Iraq ''in a daze.'' 
 Given her low self-esteem and her tendency, as a trauma victim, to suffer from fractured memory, someone like Randall would make an admittedly poor witness in court. Randall claims that after returning from war, she told her commanders about the second rape but says she was told ''not to make such a big deal about it.'' (The Navy says it knows of no internal records indicating that she had reported a sexual assault.) Since her daughter was removed from her custody last summer, she had been going for weekly hourlong therapy sessions with a civilian social worker, paid for by the V.A. She was also taking parenting classes at a social-services agency and petitioning to have the child returned to her care. Overall, she was feeling optimistic that through therapy, her PTSD was beginning slowly to subside. But she also felt it was a case of too little, too late, saying that before losing her daughter, she was receiving what for many women is considered to be a standard course of mental-health treatment in a V.A. system strapped for resources -- a 60-minute counseling session held every month. Randall shrugged, describing it. ''We never got very far with anything,'' she said, ''The guy would just ask me, 'So, how are you doing?' And I'd look at him and say, 'Well ... I guess I'm fine.' ''VII. ''It Just Kept Building Up and Building Up ... ''
 The Women's Trauma Recovery Program is tucked into a small adobe-style building on one corner of a sprawling V.A. health-care campus in Menlo Park, Calif., about 20 miles south of San Francisco. Outside there is a sunny courtyard, where residents often gather to smoke and talk. Inside there are five dorm-style bedrooms, each with a pair of twin beds. The feeling is something less than homey but something more than institutional. Next door there is a larger and more established 45-bed program for male active-duty soldiers and veterans with PTSD.
 When I arranged to visit the women's program for a couple of days last July, it was unclear whether any of the six female patients then in residence would speak to me. According to Darrah Westrup, the psychologist who leads the program, this group had only just begun its 60-to-90-day treatment program, which was devoted both to learning coping skills and to gradually doing exposure therapy for their traumas. For many of the patients, entry in the program -- gained through a referral from a mental-health specialist and then a fairly intensive application process -- felt like a last resort. Privacy, too, was paramount: some of these women had isolated themselves for years and, working with the program's therapists, were just beginning to rebuild some confidence, Westrup said.
 So it came as a surprise when, one by one, each one surfaced at Westrup's office, ready to talk to me. (They requested that I protect their privacy by not using their full names.) Each asked too that Westrup be present for the interview, and I soon understood why: despite the fact that conversation revolved mostly around the impact of living with PTSD rather than the traumatic events that caused it, the danger of a flashback always lurked. ''Are you here?'' Westrup would ask gently when somebody appeared momentarily glazed or her speech slowed down. ''Do you feel your feet on the ground?''
 Some of the women served in previous decades and were only now dealing fully with their PTSD. They recognized themselves as harbingers, as cautionary tales of how bad it could get for those of the current generation of female soldiers if they left their PTSD untreated. And they repeated that sentiment again and again. ''I'm only talking to you,'' one said, ''because I want other sisters to know they're not alone.'' 
 I met six women, two of whom served in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Most hadn't seen combat, though three of them said they were raped by fellow soldiers during deployments in Germany, in Japan, in Qatar. The women -- Johnnie, Kathy, Kathleen, Ann, Michelle and Sara -- had served in the Army, the Navy or the Air Force. What ran through nearly every woman's story was a sense of things left unresolved. Nobody mentioned perpetrators being punished. Nearly everyone expressed having gone through relentless self-questioning: ''What if I hadn't accepted that ride?'' one wondered aloud. ''What if I hadn't drank so much?'' asked another. 
 According to Patricia Resick of the National Center for PTSD, being able to process trauma is the key to recovering from it. Those people who cannot make sense of what happened to them are more likely to continue reliving it through flashbacks and intrusive memories. ''It's like a record that keeps getting stuck,'' she said. ''They can't accept that it happened because of the implications of accepting it. It means that bad things -- horrible things, really -- can happen to good people.'' 
 The women in Menlo Park described, vividly, the aftermath of living with unresolved military trauma: Kathy was arrested more than once for drunken driving. Michelle tried to kill herself three times. Sara was put into a military psychiatric hospital. Ann raised children and had a successful career, but said that inside her home in rural Northern California, she was often so paralyzed by fear that she hid in the closet any time the phone rang.
 The program required that the women spend time writing down their thoughts and then analyzing them on paper, rooting out the ''distorted thinking'' -- things like feeling unworthy or guilty -- and then reinterpreting them in a more healthful way. While each woman acknowledged that the work was painful, there seemed to be a kind of summer-camp camaraderie growing among them. Yet there was always the notion looming that at some point they, and their symptoms, would need to return home. 
 One of the two vets of the Iraq war on the V.A. campus was Kathleen, a 37-year-old Army nurse with dark hair and fair skin. She arrived at Menlo Park courtesy of a program sponsored by the Department of Defense, in which active-duty soldiers with severe PTSD are granted leave and financing to pursue residential treatment through the V.A. This is part of a larger effort across the military to find and address soldiers' mental-health issues as quickly as possible. Kathleen was a first lieutenant and a registered nurse based at Fort Sill, Okla. She was medevacked out of Baghdad less than three months earlier.
 Sitting in a chair in Westrup's office, dressed in a pastel T-shirt and jeans, Kathleen knit her fingers together anxiously. Despite appearing nervous, she seemed eager to talk. For better or worse, Kathleen's trauma was still fresh. She was also one of the few female veterans I spoke with who were suffering from PTSD who did not mention experiencing sexual harassment or assault in the military, though she did allude to ''a bad childhood.''
 Speaking in a soft drawl, she described being stationed at a combat support hospital inside Baghdad's Green Zone, working 15-hour shifts in the intensive-care unit, often tending to burn patients who were helicoptered in from southern Iraq. ''I expected some death,'' she said. ''I was realistic. What I didn't expect was that we would be taking care of so many civilians, and those civilians would be children.'' She paused to add that she had five children of her own -- all daughters, ages 9 to 18, who were back in Oklahoma with her husband, himself an Army man who'd been deployed to Iraq twice already. 
 In Baghdad, the stressors piled up quickly: helicopters kept arriving from the south, burn patients howled, children sometimes died. Lying in bed at night, Kathleen listened to mortars exploding and stray gunfire outside the Green Zone. ''It just builds up and wears down on you,'' she said. ''You're always in a heightened adrenaline rush.''
 Her hands started to tremble then. She mentioned a young boy named Mohammed who died in the Green Zone hospital early on in her time in Iraq, saying only that she felt responsible for his death. ''I can't say more about that,'' she said, shaking her head. She then described caring for another young Iraqi who'd lost his legs because of complications from a gunshot wound. She started to understand that he might not survive outside the hospital. She described a creeping feeling of powerlessness. ''You get to a point when you can't take care of everybody,'' Kathleen said, her voice quavering. ''It's really tough.'' She knotted and unknotted her hands, appearing somewhat blank.
 Westrup interjected softly, ''Kathleen, are you here?'' 
 ''I'm here,'' she said. Then she continued: ''It got to a point that I was having panic attacks all the time because we'd get a patient in, and I'd be thinking, Oh, my God, they're not going to survive, and how can I help them stop screaming and not be in pain? It just kept building up and building up. ...''
 Then one day Kathleen's superiors barred her from visiting the young man who'd had his legs amputated, suggesting that she was becoming too emotional. Since the death of the boy named Mohammed, she had been taking Paxil for depression, and about the same time, she said, an Army doctor took her off the medication. 
 ''I went crazy,'' she said plainly. ''I had a major panic attack. I felt like I couldn't get enough air.'' On the night it happened, she climbed the stairs to the hospital's rooftop, which overlooked the Green Zone. ''We sat up there millions of times, smoking our cigarettes or just shooting the breeze and watching the helicopters coming in and going out. It felt like a safe place.'' But when a hospital doctor turned up on the roof, startling her as she gasped for air, Kathleen began to cry. The doctor fetched the senior nurse on call. Believing that Kathleen was contemplating suicide, the nurse had her evacuated first from the roof, Kathleen said, and then from Baghdad altogether.
 When I asked if she considered suicide during her deployment, Kathleen answered: ''Oh, several times, but I was able to contain those thoughts. What kept me going was the thought of my children, and them not being taken care of if I killed myself.'' She did, however, rehearse some thoughts about what would happen if she wandered outside of the Green Zone and deliberately into enemy fire. ''I was worried about how children of parents who commit suicide have a higher rate of suicide themselves. I have three teenagers, and I'm thinking, I can't do that. But if I died because of the enemy, then that would be acceptable. They would be sad, but they could hold their heads high and say, 'Yes, my mom served -- she gave to this country.' ''
 Everything that happened to Kathleen -- her feelings of compassion for her Iraqi patients, the powerlessness she felt in trying to save them, the depression, Paxil and ultimate breakdown -- all very easily could have happened to one of her male colleagues. Indeed, she told me she was not the only soldier feeling great stress in the hospital: ''We were all facing these struggles,'' she said. ''There were people that were breaking down crying, nobody was sleeping well. There were a lot of nightmares.'' And yet it was Kathleen who was helicoptered out of the war on a stretcher on April 29 last year and returned to Oklahoma, to her three-acre property, her five girls and her husband. 
 Leaving Iraq and returning home to Oklahoma, Kathleen felt an instant change in her relationship with her daughters. ''It was very difficult for me to see them,'' she told me. ''I thought I would be excited and run to them and tell them I loved them, but instead I was scared. I was scared for them to hold me, to touch me. I don't know why, because I wanted to really bad. I was afraid for them to see me shake or stutter, not being able to communicate.'' She mentioned, with no small amount of heartbreak, that it was hard to reconnect with one particular daughter, who has dark hair and brown eyes, because ''she looks like she could be Iraqi.''
 Two weeks after arriving in Menlo Park, she was still baffled by how excruciating family life had become. When her 9-year-old daughter had started shouting playfully while being chased by her 11-year-old in the yard outside, her mind flashed instantly to Iraq. Kathleen said: ''It just goes through me and brings me right back. I have a lot of flashbacks. And then I'd have nightmares, afraid that they'd hear me talk in my sleep or yell out, moaning.'' She added, ''Me and their dad have had nothing but conflict after conflict, because he wants me to be a certain way, and I can't.'' Her children, she said, had begun avoiding her in order not to upset her, asking their father to drive them places, speaking quietly in her presence. 
 Kathleen started seeing an Army psychologist daily, something she found to be extremely helpful. A social worker at Fort Sill introduced the idea that she might be further helped by the women's residential program in Menlo Park. Yet having already left her children for most of the last year, Kathleen was resistant to going.
 And then came a turning point. One day, when her husband was not around to do the driving, she had the girls in the car on their way to somebody's team practice, when her 13-year-old daughter tried to offer some encouragement. ''She said, 'Mama, you can get through this; it's not like you killed anybody,' '' Kathleen recalled. ''I started crying, and she goes, 'Oh, my God, you killed somebody!' I went into another panic attack right in front of my kids.'' She welled up at the memory, saying: ''That was enough for me. I was like, I'm ready to go. I'm getting through this.'' 
 So far, however, treatment had been a mixed bag for Kathleen, mostly because she was homesick and afraid. She had, however, fostered a great deal of empathy and respect for the other women she'd met, understanding that some had lived with debilitating PTSD for 20 years.
 ''I came close to leaving here the other day,'' she told me. ''But the girls just surrounded me. They were like, 'Don't leave.' '' The women then went on to describe how they lived before treatment -- one with security cameras and a security fence at her house, another locked away in her apartment, several having lost their marriages and distanced themselves from their kids. ''They said: 'You don't want this life. I would give anything to go back to when my trauma was new and to get help with it,' '' Kathleen recalled. ''And I could see myself 20 years down the road; I would be them. And I don't want that,'' she said. ''I love these girls, but I don't want that.''VIII. What the Future Holds
 Six weeks later, I flew back to California to attend the Women's Trauma Recovery Program graduation. It was held on a Thursday morning in a wide recreation room on the building's ground floor. Someone had moved the Ping-Pong table to one side and dragged a number of chairs into neat rows. A modest buffet lunch was laid out along the room's back wall. 
 The residents took their seats at the front of the room, having clearly primped for the occasion. They then read poems, held hands, made grateful speeches to the staff and, at the end, played some pensive music on a boombox and bowed their heads, many of them weeping. It was, of course, impossible to know what was in store for any of them. Clearly, they had benefited from the cohesiveness of the group, having met others who were wrestling with the same demons. 
 There was one notable absence -- Kathleen, who, it turned out, left treatment not long after I met her, presumably to return home to her family and military life in Oklahoma. Over the next few months I sent several letters to Kathleen, hoping to speak with her, but got no response. Finally, a couple of weeks ago, she called me, apologizing for her silence. She'd only just received a medical discharge from the Army and felt comfortable talking. She had mixed feelings about leaving the military, since she loved her work as an Army nurse, but felt that the PTSD symptoms kept interfering. She'd spent much of the fall giving vaccinations to soldiers, but after a soldier passed out one day, causing her to panic, she realized she was a long way from being able to handle an urgent medical crisis. 
 Kathleen also told me that she left Menlo Park last summer after one of her daughters was involved in a minor car accident. ''I left treatment because my children were more important than my needs,'' she said. 
 What struck me again and again, meeting and talking to female Iraq veterans grappling with PTSD, was their isolation. So many, like Kathleen, seemed uncertain of what to do next. It was as if their mistrust of the world had led them to mistrust themselves. Most were on antidepressants and were receiving some counseling through the V.A., but few had a sense that their symptoms were going away. In Colorado, Amorita Randall was working to regain custody of her daughter -- a process that she found discouraging. ''Just because I'm disabled doesn't mean I can't care for my daughter,'' she told me. Recently, after months of waiting, Keli Frasier, the mother in Colorado who had been struggling with depression, finally managed to schedule an appointment with a V.A. psychiatrist to obtain new antidepressants. Across the state in Denver, Keri Christensen said she was still haunted by nightmares and unnerved by driving. 
 And finally, there was Suzanne Swift, who in early December was given a summary court-martial at Fort Lewis, a hearing normally used for minor offenses. As part of a plea bargain, she pled guilty to ''missing movement'' and being absent without leave. Her rank was reduced to private, and she spent the next 21 days, including Christmas, in a military prison in Washington State. The Army ruled that in order to receive an honorable discharge, Swift was dutybound to complete her five-year enlistment, which ends in early 2009. After finishing her stint in prison in January, Swift says she checked herself into the inpatient psych ward at Fort Lewis's hospital for a few days but ultimately was released back to duty. She told me she was trying generally to ignore the PTSD but had taken to drinking a lot in order to get by. ''I kind of liked the Army before all that stuff happened,'' she said in early February, on the phone from her barracks at Fort Lewis. ''I was good at my job. I did what I was supposed to do. And then in Iraq, I got disillusioned. All of a sudden this Army you care so much about is like, well, all you're good for is to have sex with and that's it.'' She added, ''I really, really, really, don't want to be here.'' 
 The Army had issued an order for Swift to be transferred to a base in California later this spring. Swift was unhappy about the change, because it would take her farther from her family in Oregon, but she was also considering other plans. ''Did you know,'' she said, ''that there's some program near San Francisco that's just for women who have PTSD?'' She paused for amoment, surrounded by the silence in the barracks at Fort Lewis, then said, ''I'm thinking about trying to get in there.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 25, 2007

 CORRECTION:
The cover article in The Times Magazine on March 18 reported on women who served in Iraq, the sexual abuse that some of them endured and the struggle for all of them to reclaim their prewar lives. One of the servicewomen, Amorita Randall, a former naval construction worker, told The Times that she was in combat in Iraq in 2004 and that in one incident an explosive device blew up a Humvee she was riding in, killing the driver and leaving her with a brain injury. She also said she was raped twice while she was in the Navy.
 On March 6, three days before the article went to press, a Times researcher contacted the Navy to confirm Ms. Randall's account. There was preliminary back and forth but no detailed reply until hours before the deadline. At that time, a Navy spokesman confirmed to the researcher that Ms. Randall had won a Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal with Marine Corps insignia, which was designated for those who served in a combat area, including Iraq, or in direct support of troops deployed in one. But the spokesman said there was no report of the Humvee incident or a record of Ms. Randall's having suffered an injury in Iraq. The spokesman also said that Ms. Randall's commander, who served in Iraq, remembered her but said that her unit was never involved in combat while it was in Iraq. Both of these statements from the Navy were included in the article. The article also reported that the Navy had no record of a sexual-assault report involving Ms. Randall.
 After The Times researcher spoke with the Navy, the reporter called Ms. Randall to ask about the discrepancies. She stood by her account. 
 On March 12, three days after the article had gone to press, the Navy called The Times to say that it had found that Ms. Randall had never received imminent-danger pay or a combat-zone tax exemption, indicating that she was never in Iraq. Only part of her unit was sent there; Ms. Randall served with another part of it in Guam. The Navy also said that Ms. Randall was given the medal with the insignia because of a clerical error.
 Based on the information that came to light after the article was printed, it is now clear that Ms. Randall did not serve in Iraq, but may have become convinced she did. Since the article appeared, Ms. Randall herself has questioned another member of her unit, who told Ms. Randall that she was not deployed to Iraq. If The Times had learned these facts before publication, it would not have included Ms. Randall in the article.

Amorita Randall: ''Saying something was looked down upon,'' says the naval construction worker who served in Iraq in 2004 and says she was raped.
Keli Frasier: ''I didn't really start having mental issues until we got home,'' says the Army reservist (here with her son), who watched her squad leader die in Iraq.
 Kathleen: ''I was worried how children of parents who commit suicide have a higher rate of suicide themselves,'' says the mother of five, who as an Army nurse tended to wounded Iraqi children. ''But if I died because of the enemy, then that would be acceptable.'' Kate Bulson: ''Over there, I would hear an explosion at night and sleep through it,'' says the Army sergeant, who ran patrols. ''Now I hear the slightest sound and I wake up.'' (Photographs by Katy Grannan for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: St. Ann's Mother Hen and Her Crowded Nest

BYLINE: By CELIA McGEE

 BODY:
IF Susan Feldman could explain why ''The Princess and the Pea'' is her favorite fairy tale, believe her, she would. She isn't one for holding back. Not her ideas about music, theater and performance art. Not her commitment to tough, raw, emotion-provoking material. Not -- as her friend Rosanne Cash's dad might have put it -- her penchant for walking the creative line where the sharpest edges are cut. 
 Ms. Feldman was standing last month in the cavernous lobby of St. Ann's Warehouse, the Brooklyn performance space converted from a spice-milling factory that she leads as founder and artistic director. It was a big day: The Wooster Group had arrived with the complex, brain-teasing set for its highly experimental, multimedia ''Hamlet,'' and Ms. Feldman was greeting the members of the cast and crew as they arrived. ''Kate, Kate,'' she said, enveloping the Wooster Group star Kate Valk in a tight hug.
Yet Ms. Feldman's mind was already racing ahead, she said, to the visit she was about to make to Amsterdam to figure out how to transfer the Dutch actress and director Adelheid Roosen's paired plays ''The Veiled Monologues'' and ''Is.Man'' to her theater next season. 
 ''The plays are fantastic,'' she said, ''and Roosen is a real firebrand. One is about female Muslim culture and issues of sexuality, intimacy and family. The other deals with men convicted of 'honor' and revenge killings in Holland, which the Dutch are very focused on. The plays were actually presented to a national convention of police officers last year and even put on in Parliament.'' 
 Frothy fables about fussy, girly teenagers are not Ms. Feldman's stock in trade with Arts at St. Ann's, which is at the vanguard of the avant-garde. This performance program, after 20 years, left its original quarters in the Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity in Brooklyn Heights and reincarnated itself in St. Ann's Warehouse, in the Dumbo area of Brooklyn. It recently celebrated its fifth anniversary in its new location and it is extending the occasion with ''Hamlet,'' an ambitious and unprecedented collaboration not only with the Wooster Group, which has done several projects at the Warehouse, but also, for the first time, with the Public Theater, where a further developed production of ''Hamlet'' will be presented in the fall. 
 ''Hamlet,'' which takes up a large swath of St. Ann's 14,000-square-foot building at 38 Water Street, is close to sold out for its entire run, which ends March 25. The prominent production is a large-scale tease of things to come: Ms. Feldman is prepping her biggest season. 
 Yet hanging on the wall within direct sight of the entrance to Ms. Feldman's office is a framed drawing of the sleep-deprived princess atop her mountain of feather beds.
 ''It's a drawing from the original Broadway production of 'Once Upon a Mattress,' '' said Ms. Feldman, who is herself known for working through the night.
 ''Susan is intense,'' said Mark Russell, who assembled ''Under the Radar,'' a festival of new theater work, in 2005. She gave him the job, his first after his difficult departure from Performance Space 122, where he had been a longtime artistic director. 
 ''She knows what she wants, she works from her gut, and she has an incredible sense of what's right -- and will fight you until you see it her way,'' Mr. Russell said. ''She's also a marketing wiz and very fierce about getting the word out. It's how she's been able to get audiences across the bridge and through that cold neighborhood into her seats.''
 Perhaps it was those '50s musicals that her grandfather took her to when she was a girl growing up in Neponsit, Queens -- ''Once Upon a Mattress'' among them -- that made the dazzlingly redheaded Ms. Feldman so certain that everything would turn out exactly as she envisioned, even in the most unlikely circumstances.
 Ms. Feldman has since made her whirlwind European scouting trip, which included Vienna. ''Saw a 'Medea' directed by Grzegorz Jarzyna,'' she wrote in an e-mail message from her hotel room around 1:30 a.m. Mr. Jarzyna, she said, is ''the Polish director whose work I love and whose 'Macbeth' we hope to bring this summer.''
 Since the elaborately staged ''Macbeth'' is too large to fit inside the warehouse, she wants to mount it outdoors, in the adjacent Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park, and is negotiating with the state to that end. Though the location, the financing and other complicated arrangements are not set, Ms. Feldman's optimism is not acquainted with limits.
 Certainly it took a high degree of confidence for Ms. Feldman and Susan Henshaw Jones, then president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, to convince the Episcopal diocese in 1981 to share its almost empty, crumbling Gothic Revival church -- known to some as ''Brooklyn's cathedral'' -- for a live music series in exchange for restoration work and fund-raising. 
 Starting with chamber music and a choral series, Ms. Feldman soon expanded to contemporary fare like Marianne Faithfull in the Brecht-Weill opera ''The Seven Deadly Sins''; Aaron Neville in one of his early solo performances; Lou Reed and John Cale performing their ''Songs for Drella''; and performances by Ms. Cash, Rufus Wainwright, David Byrne and Lucinda Williams. Also integral were puppet theater and puppet operas, evolving into St. Ann's influential Puppet Lab.
 ''Susan has got to be the most driven person I've ever met,'' said David Fraser, who led the church restoration projects with Ms. Feldman and who dissolved his partnership with St. Ann's three years ago to start the nearby Brooklyn Stained Glass Conservation Center. ''She taught me a lot about setting your sights very high, taking on complicated projects and going after insurmountable amounts of money. She's like a bull. She just puts her head down and charges.''
 St. Ann's Warehouse is ''an oxygen tank for New York theater,'' said Tom Sellar, editor of Theater Magazine at Yale. ''A lot of theaters are scared and nervous for economic reasons, but Susan is fearless.'' 
 The split of Arts at St. Ann's from the church after two decades was bitter and litigious. The Rev. Angela V. Askew, who took over as priest at the church several years after the rift, said she thought the former church officials resented the arts program's success. 
 ''It was a question of the tail wagging the dog,'' she said. ''Problems like that arise everywhere where a program in a church is intended to stand on its own. It was a most unfortunate separation.''
 The move from the church to the warehouse came with the support of David Walentas of Two Trees Management, the landlord of some 2.5 million square feet of Dumbo real estate and owner of the space. Mr. Walentas is also on Ms. Feldman's board, which plans to expand the organization even more. Eventually, if Mr. Walentas gets his way, Arts at St. Ann's will move across the street, to a larger space inside the scenic brick ruins of a 19th-century tobacco depot. The board wants to increase St. Ann's annual budget to $4 million from $2.5 million.
 Besides being on the threshold of its boldest season, St. Ann's Warehouse is going Hollywood, in its own fashion. Ms. Feldman excels in persuading artists to venture into new genres and disciplines, and last year the filmmaking brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, their musical collaborator Carter Burwell and the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman helped create ''Theater of the New Ear,'' a fresh take on old-fashioned radio plays, with actors like Meryl Streep, Peter Dinklage and John Goodman. 
 And soon Mr. Kaufman will return in a different capacity, he said. ''I'm directing my first movie,'' he said. The main character of the film, titled ''Synecdoche, New York'' and starring Philip Seymour Hoffman, ''is a theater director, and I needed a theater for him. I want to use St. Ann's.''
 St. Ann's former home in a church lent itself to presenting music, but its current home is big enough for larger-scale concerts, more spectacular theatrical productions and the sprawling musical theater pieces that Ms. Feldman encourages.
 She hopes to schedule the National Theater of Scotland's ''Black Watch,'' about a Scottish regiment in Iraq, for fall. She is in talks with Daniel Kramer, the London-based American director whose Elvis-inflected ''Woyzeck'' played at the Warehouse last year, to do another work. ''Susan produces work that inspires her, not her accountants,'' Mr. Kramer said in an e-mail message.
 Lou Reed's punk song cycle ''Berlin,'' in its first live staging in December, with Mr. Reed among the cast, was the most sweeping collaboration with St. Ann's, but probably not the last. 
 ''None of those things I did would have happened without Susan,'' Mr. Reed said. ''She's a wonder, and a good person. She's always ready to take a chance. Next time I have a dream, I will be on the phone with her.''
 Ms. Feldman's partnerships, ranging from the Wooster Group to the Brooklyn Academy of Music to the Sydney Festival in Australia, are all based on collaboration, she said. 
 She sees this preference as rooted in the social activism she embraced at New York University in the late '60s, an approach she maintained through her work in alternative education, drug-treatment programs and prisons. 
 ''To me the arts are about change, and artists are an active force for change,'' she said. ''One of the things we've kept with us from the church is a kind of spirituality -- the wildness of people following some force, the way actors will say something is speaking through them. It's alchemy. I'm drawn to artists who make work for tough times, who are working politically, but whose politics lie in their passion.'' 
 Ms. Cash said Ms. Feldman had more than a touch of the poet herself.
 ''Susan reminds me of Mabel Dodge Luhan,'' Ms. Cash said. ''She's not only a patron but an artist. It's like when Mabel Luhan worked at Taos and all the artists followed. Susan went to Brooklyn. And we all followed.''

HEADLINE: Beyond the Bubble, With Small-Cap Stocks

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
SMALL-CAP stocks are significantly overvalued. In fact, they are even pricier, on average, than they were in March 2000, just before the Internet bubble burst. In contrast, the average large-cap stock is moderately undervalued.
 This picture of a highly bifurcated stock market is painted by data from Ford Equity Research of San Diego, which tracks around 4,500 publicly traded companies in the United States. Among companies that have been publicly traded for at least seven years, the firm reports that 55 percent have higher price-to-earnings ratios today than they did in March 2000. The bulk of these pricier issues, however, are in the smaller-cap sectors. Among the very largest companies, the average P/E ratio is now just a third of what it was seven years ago.
If investors focused only on the broad stock market averages, however, they might conclude that the entire market is undervalued. According to Standard & Poor's, for example, the P/E ratio of the S.& P. 500 currently stands at 17, based on trailing 12-month operating earnings. The comparable ratio at the end of March 2000 was 31.1, almost double the current level. 
 Though the S.& P 500 includes many large-cap stocks, it also contains smaller-cap issues. Why is the index's P/E ratio nevertheless so much lower than it was seven years ago? 
 The answer lies in how the index is put together. The S.& P. 500 is a capitalization-weighted index, meaning that each company's contribution to it is a function of the company's size. That would not necessarily skew the average P/E ratio for the index itself, if the average valuations of both larger and smaller stocks were similar. But that's not the situation today, according to Ford Equity Research: the 50 companies in the S.& P. 500 with the smallest market caps have an average P/E ratio that is much higher than it was seven years ago, while the ratio for the 50 largest-cap stocks in the index is significantly lower.
 According to Ford Equity Research, the average P/E ratio among the 50 largest-cap companies is now 19, about a third of the average of 60.7 for the biggest 50 in March 2000. The average market cap for the 50 largest companies is now $123 billion, versus $153 billion in March 2000. 
 Contrast those numbers with those for the 50 smallest companies in the index: their average P/E ratio is now 30.7, versus 20.3 seven years ago. And their average market cap is now $3 billion, versus $1 billion.
 In other words, the smallest-cap stocks in the S.& P. 500 are significantly more overvalued today than they were seven years ago. Yet their higher P/E ratios barely affect the ratio for the index as a whole. That's because the combined market capitalization of the 50 largest stocks account for nearly half the market cap of the entire S.& P. 500, while that of the 50 smallest stocks add up to just 1.2 percent of the total.
 ''Investors who pay attention to the P/E ratio of cap-weighted indexes such as the S.& P. 500 therefore need to exercise great care when drawing conclusions about stocks' relative valuations,'' Richard Segarra, director of research at Ford Equity Research, said in an interview. ''At best, the P/E ratios for such indexes shed light only on their largest-cap stocks; we should avoid drawing any inference from a cap-weighted index's P/E ratio about the valuations of its smallest-cap members.''
 MR. SEGARRA found that the index's prevailing pattern also holds true across the universe of stocks that his firm tracks. As a result, an investor who emphasizes market sectors according to relative P/E ratios would have a very different portfolio today than in March 2000. Back then, he would have favored small caps over large caps -- and been handsomely rewarded for this choice. The trend is seen in the annualized total returns since March 31, 2000, of three Dow Jones Wilshire indexes: 10.1 percent for the U.S. Microcap Index and 7.2 percent for the U.S. Small-Cap Index, but only 0.5 percent for the U.S. Large-Cap index.
 Today, however, according to Mr. Segarra, that investor would favor large caps over small caps. Not only is the average P/E ratio of large-cap stocks only a third as high as it was in March 2000, it is nearly 10 percent below its average level of the last five years. There's no guarantee, of course, that large caps will outperform small caps over the next five years -- but there's a good argument to be made that they will.

HEADLINE: Is the Key to Creativity in Your Pillbox, or in Your PC?

BYLINE: By G. PASCAL ZACHARY. 
G. Pascal Zachary teaches journalism at Stanford and writes about technology and economic development. E-mail: gzach@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
LOVERS do it. Athletes, too. And even students, cramming for exams. They all take pills to enhance their performance. 
 To some degree, many a worker involved in creative activity does, too, but with cups of strong coffee from the corner Starbucks or the employee snack room. ''Caffeine is now a gateway drug'' that leads to a universe of ingestible mental enhancers, says Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, a futurist and science historian in Menlo Park, Calif. ''I foresee a day when the office medicine chest holds much more than aspirin.''
 The whole notion of popping pills to enhance creativity upsets those who think of intelligence as natural and pharmaceutical interventions as a response to disease or a flaw that needs correcting. 
 Drug makers, after all, focus on pathologies like narcolepsy or Alzheimer's disease rather than improving cognition in otherwise healthy people. Yet the growing number of students who use Provigil, an anti-narcolepsy drug from Cephalon that enhances alertness, to gain a performance edge suggests that the clinical definition is loose enough to drive a whole lot of creative energy. 
 In the same way, an emerging class of drugs aimed at helping people with Alzheimer's may become popular with healthy, older workers hoping to quicken their wits. Even some exotic plants and herbs, like the Andean root maca (Lepidium meyenii), are gaining popularity because some research suggests they heighten mental acuity and energy.
 Drugs carry risks, of course, and while the public obsesses on the adverse reactions to pharmaceuticals, the real risk of performance enhancers is the problem of diminishing returns. Knowledge workers, powered by biochemical enhancers, may realize only too late that a favored enhancer masks a flaw in their intellectual approach to a problem. The creativity shortcut could actually place a person in a delusional state in which weak ideas are mistaken for strong ones.
 ''There's a strong fantasy element in the idea of a pill that can make people smarter,'' says Mitchell Kapor, a pioneer in information technology. (He helped create what was once the world's most popular spreadsheet software, Lotus 1-2-3.) Ultimately, such pills might face digital rivals if current trends in computer science continue. Engineers are busy designing better search engines and ''virtual worlds'' online where we can test ideas and share experiences with others in ways perhaps not possible today. Mr. Kapor is an investor in Linden Labs, the creator of a virtual world called Second Life. 
 Proponents of mind-expanding electronic technologies, like Mr. Kapor, argue that creativity is the making new connections between diverse data and seeing fresh patterns in what others consider an old image. That's exactly what computers do well.
 Any search on Google, for instance, makes thousands of very fast connections in a way that, if not creative, certainly mimics some aspects of the human mind. That's no accident. Since the advent of computer networks in the 1960s, engineers and designers have held out the hope that these networks will improve individual intelligence, creativity and even output. Douglas C. Englebart, the computer engineering pioneer, became a central figure in this movement as he talked incessantly of ''mind augmentation'' through electronic networking.
 The hardware and software required to realize mind augmentation took decades to arrive, but the Internet has now became the ''world brain'' envisioned in the 1930s by H. G. Wells. Now each of us, whenever we log onto the Internet, can amplify our own thoughts by making rapid connections to articles, reports and even books, images and films that not long ago would have taken a small army to assemble. We have this information in hours, if not minutes.
 Collective creativity surely seems assisted by the computer networks. ''The Internet creates an environment where people are encouraged to share ideas with people they've never met,'' says Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Stanford who studies problems of creativity. ''That spawns the development of ideas that are more robust and create a wider range of perspectives.''
 Wikipedia and open-source software seem compelling examples of advances in the collective I.Q. Yet these may be special cases that merely show that computer networks remain unrivaled at solving brute-force problems akin to plugging a peg into one hole after another until the peg fits.
 THE next step is personalizing the creative connections that individuals make over a lifetime, a process to which search, as we currently experience it, is blind. Google is already experimenting with personalized search, but results hardly begin to suggest how we apply these findings to the latest problem we are trying to solve. Computer visionaries ultimately want search results to match our own temperaments and to fire our creativity.
 There is a history to this dream. As far back as the 1940s, Vannevar Bush, science adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the organizational chief of the Manhattan Project, conceived of an information concept he called ''associative trails.'' These trails are the mental connections made during a focused inquiry. Mr. Bush's insight was to imagine that a machine could record the brain's hopscotch and store it for future review. Ultimately, the machine would store a lifetime of associative trails by a single mind, enabling the thinker to move quickly to the sweet spot of a problem because, on his creativity-automation machine, he could quickly incorporate the lessons of past approaches in building a better one.
 We are a long way from holding a road map of all our creative inquiries. There is no tool now to distill quickly the lessons from the thousands of past inquiries so that we conduct the next one more brilliantly. To make connections -- to decide what to do with the stuff Google delivers us with such speed -- we still depend on our minds. We can be delivered links, say, to a range of photographs by Edward Weston but we still must decide how best to use the images. That's because computer networks remain best at handling structure, not information itself, whose value depends on both context and the recipients' needs and aspirations.
 The engineer's answer ''is coming along more slowly than we expected,'' says Eric A. Brewer, director of an Intel research lab in Berkeley, Calif., and a computer science professor at the University of California. Mr. Brewer, who created one of the world's great search engines, Inktomi (now owned by Yahoo), says that the problem ''is harder than people suspect.''
 ''We don't have a link structure for your personal stuff,'' he added. ''We're not getting at the content.''
 The gap between what the Internet promises and what it delivers is part of the reason that people, seeking higher states of consciousness and creativity, continue to turn to enhancers from caffeine to maca to virtual reality.
 Which brings us to the big idea staring us in the face. By now it is clear that Big Pharma and Big Computing are running an unspoken race, to decide which technology -- the electronic or the biochemical -- can first deliver the magic elixir that gives humans vastly improved creative powers. Might we be heading, however fitfully, toward a new industrial age when Microsoft buys Merck to better compete with Google?

HEADLINE: Will The Fed Take Away The Chill?

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
SHARES of some subprime mortgage lenders have plummeted, while interest rates on low-quality debt have headed the opposite way. That suggests that investors are worried about economic conditions, and Federal Reserve policy makers may use their meeting this week to convey the same concern.
 The Fed is unlikely to give Wall Street the rate cut many people seem to be pining for, said Henry J. Herrmann, chief executive of Waddell & Reed Financial. But he expects the statement accompanying the rate decision on Wednesday to indicate a less aggressive posture toward inflation, despite higher-than-expected inflation numbers last week. 
''The Fed has got to be thinking pretty hard about another statement with a tightening bias in it,'' Mr. Herrmann said. The central bank has issued a string of statements after recent meetings highlighting the risk of an overheating economy and the need to be on guard against rising prices. After this meeting, he said, ''the spin is going to have to be softer than before, maybe a lot softer.''
 He said that the 0.2 percent increase reported in the core Consumer Price Index for February was in line with economists' expectations, even if the 0.4 percent in the overall C.P.I. was on the high side. In addition, the 1.3 percent increase in the Producer Price Index for February was stronger than expected, but that index is volatile. ''I don't put a lot of emphasis on the P.P.I. in forming my thinking on Fed behavior,'' he said.
 The rise in credit spreads -- the gap in interest rates between high-quality debt like Treasury bonds and issues of less creditworthy borrowers -- shows that traders understand that business conditions are riskier, he said. That, in turn, threatens to undermine the economic expansion by pulling capital from the financial system. ''People are pulling in their horns,'' Mr. Herrmann said. ''Whatever the forecast was for the economy, it's going to be revised to something lower.''
 He said that he would be ''very surprised if there were no softening of wording'' in the Fed statement, but that if the language did not change, ''the Treasury bond market will probably rally and the stock market will take it poorly.'' If the Fed does dial down its anti-inflation talk, stocks may rise, he said, although not for long.
 ''After a relief rally,'' Mr. Herrmann said, traders ''will go back and look at the fundamentals and consider how soft the economy is and how much lower earnings will have to be revised.''DATA WATCH -- Housing market statistics this week are expected to provide the same uncomfortable reading that they have for several months. Housing starts, scheduled to be announced Tuesday, are forecast in a Bloomberg News poll of economists to have risen to an annual rate of 1.45 million units in February from 1.41 million units a month earlier.
 Building permits, which anticipate construction rather than reporting past activity, are estimated to have fallen to an annual rate of 1.550 million in February from 1.568 million in January.
 Not much joy is foreseen on Friday, either, when sales of existing homes in February will be announced. The Bloomberg poll predicts a decline to a rate of 6.34 million units a year, from 6.46 million.

HEADLINE: New Inflation Fears Cap a Rocky Week

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
It was another rough week on Wall Street and it ended with a thud, after a report on inflation on Friday alarmed many investors in advance of this week's Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates. 
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics report on the Consumer Price Index showed that in February, prices rose 0.4 percent, double the increase for the previous month.
Core prices, excluding the volatile categories of food and energy, rose 0.2 percent in February, but that left them up 2.7 percent over the year, greater than the 1 to 2 percent comfort range for inflation identified by Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman. 
 Although there is evidence that the economy is slowing, the inflation readings may make it difficult for the Fed to contemplate reducing interest rates.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 165.91 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 12.110.41. the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 15.90 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 1,386.95. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 14.89 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 2,372,66. All three major stock indexes are down for the year.
 In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.54 percent from 4.59 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Do You Know Where That Art Has Been?

BYLINE: By RON STODGHILL

 BODY:
THE statue, Apollo the Lizard Slayer, was stunning. The five-foot-tall bronze, created by the Greek artist Praxiteles as many as 2,350 years ago, depicts the nude god poised to ambush a lizard. 
 And the Cleveland Museum of Art wanted it. During a visit to Geneva in 2003, Michael Bennett, the museum's curator of Greek and Roman art, noticed a statue beneath a black cloth while browsing at Phoenix Ancient Art, an exclusive antiquities gallery. After Hicham and Ali Aboutaam, the dapper Lebanese brothers who owned the gallery, pulled off the cloth to reveal the Apollo Sauroktonos, as it is also known, it did not take long for the museum to buy it.
 It did so despite the Aboutaams' disclosure that the statue's ownership history was dubious at best.
 Although it is thought to be the very statue described by Pliny the Elder in the first century, other details have been lost to time, along with one arm. The statue was part of a private estate in the former East Germany, the Aboutaams said, before it was discovered in pieces in 1990. The family who reclaimed the estate after German reunification sold the work to an undisclosed Dutchman in 1994. That person sold the statue to another collector, who sold it to the Aboutaams in 2001 with the understanding that he would remain anonymous. 
 The museum's own experts spent a year investigating the provenance. Physical evidence proved that the sculpture had been out of the ground for at least a century, so its sale did not violate international laws and treaties aimed at halting illicit trade in art and antiquities.
 Nevertheless, last month, the Apollo's murky past returned to haunt the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Aboutaams, who are among the world's most powerful dealers of antiquities. The Louvre in Paris withdrew a request to borrow the statue from the Cleveland museum for an exhibition after the Greek government threatened a boycott. The Greek pressure on the Louvre drew applause from many in the art world, particularly academics who have long criticized antiquities trading as fraught with corruption. 
 Hicham Aboutaam, 39, called the Louvre's decision unfortunate: ''The Apollo was proven to have been in circulation more than 100 years ago. The Greeks are not saying that the Apollo shouldn't be here or that it was stolen. It is just their way of scoring a P.R. coup.'' 
 The Louvre's sudden case of cold feet was hardly surprising. Some of the world's most prestigious museums have been sullied by accusations of acquiring artwork that was believed to have once been looted or stolen. The J. Paul Getty Museum of Art in Los Angeles agreed to return to Italy nearly two dozen artworks whose provenance was in dispute, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York returned to Italy the Euphronios krater, a 2,500-year-old vessel for mixing water and wine that the Italian government said had been looted by tomb raiders. 
 As the provenance of antiquities and artworks is questioned, so is the provenance of dealers themselves. 
 The new wariness of collectors, both public and private, to buy or exhibit works that do not have the most rigorously documented history jeopardizes the business of even the most established dealers. So the Aboutaams are remaking themselves and their business. In a trade that has been full of grave robbers and forgers adding patina to new objects, they are busy digging up documentation for everything they sell in an effort to polish their reputation. 
 ''The world has changed for antiquities dealers,'' said Christopher A. Marinello, general counsel for the Art Loss Register, an organization that keeps a database of stolen artworks. ''More than ever, they want to know whether they may have acquired any illegal or stolen antiquities so they can return it to the country of origin.''
 Joseph Coplin, co-owner of the 30-year-old Antiquarium Fine Ancient Arts Gallery in Manhattan, put it another way: ''These days I spend most of my time pushing paper around trying to get provenances in order. It's a bit like jaywalking -- these laws have been on the books for years but until now nobody paid attention to them.''
 IF Phoenix Ancient Art and other dealers ignore the shifting standards in the antiquities market, it will be at their peril, Hicham Aboutaam said.
 ''It's a moment of clarification in the field,'' he said. ''We're still figuring out what can be acquired and sold without problems, as opposed to 40 or 50 years ago, when people were much more careless about ownership history. The question to me now is, where do we draw the line? What if a piece was already in circulation before these new standards? The archaeologists don't have an answer to that. They don't say throw it out, and they don't encourage you to buy it. What are we supposed to do?'' 
 For the Aboutaams, whose father started the gallery in Beirut in the 1960s, the makeover will require not only overhauling some of its business practices, but also restoring a public image dogged by legal and ethical questions. 
 In 2004, after an investigation by the United States Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Hicham Aboutaam pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in connection with his importing and selling for $950,000 a silver ceremonial drinking vessel that at the time was alleged to be part of the plundered Iranian Western Cave Treasure. He paid a $5,000 fine.
 That same year, an Egyptian court sentenced Ali Aboutaam in absentia to 15 years in prison after he was accused of smuggling artifacts from Egypt to Switzerland. The charges against him were later dropped by the Egyptian court due to a lack of evidence. 
 Such run-ins with the law have made big museums nervous even when nothing may appear untoward. In 2001, the Kimball Art Museum in Fort Worth returned a 2600 B.C. Sumerian statue it had bought from the brothers for $2.7 million for a refund. Hicham Aboutaam said that questions surrounding the taxes on his parents' estate unraveled the deal.
 Such accusations come from jealous rivals, said Hicham Aboutaam, who sells the objects that his 41-year-old brother, who works in the Geneva office, finds. ''We can't control the gossip and fabrications about us,'' Mr. Aboutaam said. ''It's a question of statistics: how many cases have we had against us and how many pieces have we sold? We've had very few cases and thousands of pieces. You do the math.''
 There is much for rivals to envy about Phoenix Ancient Art. It is a closely held company whose long list of clients has ranged from the Wall Street financier Michael H. Steinhardt to the late designer Bill Blass, and the Aboutaams declined to disclose the gallery's sales. But people in the industry said the company's New York and Geneva galleries generate higher annual revenues than what the auction houses Sotheby's and Christies bring in selling antiquities, which is less than $40 million. 
 Sitting recently in the small, appointment-only gallery on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that houses Phoenix Ancient Art, Hicham Aboutaam cradled in his hands a basalt sculpture of a Phoenician god. He offered a quick art history lesson by pointing out its unique blend of styles characteristic of two ancient civilizations, Egypt and Mesopotamia.
 ''This is the most important Phoenician head in the world,'' Mr. Aboutaam said. Intricately carved and dating back to about 1800 B.C., the god wears a horned crown and its eyes, now hollowed out, were once bejeweled with white stone and black glass, most likely obsidian, Mr. Aboutaam said. ''We have been watching this work for a very long time,'' he said. ''My father wanted it in the 1970s and couldn't get it because at the time the collector wouldn't sell it.'' 
 The opportunity to acquire the sculpture came a few months ago, when Ali Aboutaam, who had spent years nurturing a relationship with the late collector's son, a French archaeology expert, finally persuaded the man to sell the sculpture to help defray the cost of an extensive renovation of his Paris home. Of course, the Aboutaams do not plan to own the sculpture for long. Later this week, the Phoenician head will be exhibited at the International Asian Art Fair in New York, where Hicham Aboutaam said he expects the work to fetch a price ''in the low seven figures'' from one of two collectors he has told about the piece. 
 Magda Grigorian, a spokeswoman for the fair, which begins Friday, said that Phoenix Ancient Art was the only antiquities dealer invited, and that a ''group of antiquities specialists from a larger committee of art experts'' had reviewed the Aboutaams' sculpture and the provenance they provided. 
 ''The perception of antiquity dealers these days is a little bit cloak and dagger,'' Ms. Grigorian said. ''But in the case of Phoenix, we give them credit for working hard to change that perception.'' 
 FOR the Aboutaams, that perception dates back to 1968 when their father, Sleiman, founded Phoenix Ancient Art in the living room of his Beirut home. A worldly, well-connected Lebanese businessman who had amassed a fortune through an exclusive contract to supply general merchandise to oil tankers in the Kuwaiti port of Al Ahmadi, the elder Mr. Aboutaam was also a history buff whose penchant for collecting rare coins led to acquiring rare antiquities.
 His younger son recalls his father as obsessed with ancient objects, filling his home virtually every week with a new lot of them.
 ''My mother would tell my father, 'It's time to go sleep. Would you please remove that head from our bed?,' '' Hicham Aboutaam said. His father also infused the boys with the same passion for antiquities, showing them catalogs of ancient coins and quizzing them about Greek rulers and Roman emperors and empresses and, of course, teaching them how to assess the value of the coins based on their style, quality and condition.
 Often with his toddlers in tow, Sleiman Aboutaam was soon exporting antiquities to Syria, Egypt, Turkey and Jordan.
 Over the next decade, the Aboutaams' antiquities business flourished. Hicham Aboutaam studied art history at the University of Michigan with plans to become an architect, while his older brother completed a civil engineering degree at the Jesuit University of Beirut. But their career plans changed suddenly in September 1998, when their parents died on Swissair Flight 111 when it crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off Nova Scotia.
 ''We thought it would be best to liquidate the inventory,'' Hicham Aboutaam said. ''But then we made the decision to continue.'' He said they could not just sell everything off, not after what their father had taught them. ''The trouble was, my father lived by the philosophy that whoever loved an antiquity the most should own it,'' he said. ''In a sense, we inherited much of that legacy.'' 
 At times, the late founder's patrimony has been a Pandora's Box. Its inventory has often put his sons at odds with governments, museums and collectors. In a world of shifting political climates, the father's decisions still affect the business nearly a decade after his death. For instance, Mr. Aboutaam said that he clashed with Christies over its refusal to accept a Sumerian weapon owned by Phoenix Ancient Art. It was acquired by his father from the auction house in 1994. But its origins in Iraq make it subject to international oversight that is complicated by the turmoil in that country. ''They sold it to us, and now they won't even touch it,'' he said. ''That seems crazy to me.''
 A Christies spokeswoman, Bendetta Roux, said: ''No one has approached Christies with this item, and we have not seen it since we sold it in 1994.'' 
 Antiquities experts say the mood in the art world turned sharply with the 2002 conviction of the prominent New York art dealer Frederick Schultz. He was found guilty of violating the 1934 National Stolen Property Act by conspiring to receive stolen Egyptian antiquities.
 The case highlighted the dealer's underhanded techniques. Jonathan Tokeley-Parry, a British restorer, testified against Mr. Schultz about an elaborate scheme in which Mr. Tokeley-Parry would buy freshly unearthed Egyptian antiquities and disguise them as cheap souvenirs by coating them in plastic and paint. He would then export them from Egypt to Mr. Schultz, who would create a fake provenance for the items and sell them in his Manhattan gallery.
 Among the tricks that surfaced during the investigation was an admission by Mr. Tokeley-Parry to baking the labels of the antiquities in an oven and dabbing them with moist tea bags to create an aged appearance.
 The Schultz scandal created a cloud of distrust under which antiquities dealers still operate. Ali Aboutaam said a French dealer recently offered to sell him a beautiful red Greek vase from the late fifth century B.C. ''The piece was quite important, really,'' Ali Aboutaam said. The dealer said it had come from a 1960s collection, but Mr. Aboutaam said he could see that the restoration was of a technique used in the last 10 years. 
 ''I was not convinced of its provenance, and had to leave it behind,'' he said. ''I figured it probably, at some point, came from an illegal excavation.'' 
 He added: ''So many people bring me legitimate works that there is no reason to acquire something that I am doubtful about.''
 But the newfound wariness has been a boon to some dealers. It has bolstered the value of antiquities that have a solid ownership history, the Aboutaams say. During an auction at Sotheby's London in 1973, for example, a well-documented Egyptian banded alabaster jar created during the dynasty of King Neco II in about 600 B.C. sold for $8,910. In 2004, the Aboutaams acquired the jar at Sotheby's New York for $224,000. That meant a compounded annual rate of return of about 11 percent, but it is appreciating even faster these days. ''Because of the jar's high quality and exceptional provenance, I could sell it for $400,000 today,'' Hicham Aboutaam said. 
 Indeed, if countries ban the exportation of excavated antiquities, the restricted supply will force prices higher. Those dealers with an inventory and a network of clients will prosper while new dealers will have trouble establishing themselves.
 So it is not surprising that Hicham Aboutaam has begun supporting the bans. He envisions that the market for antiquities, which he says are currently undervalued, will resemble that of old masters or Impressionist paintings, which have increased sharply in value of late. 
 ''The more questionable works entering the antiquities market, the less their value and the larger the dark cloud that hangs over the field,'' Mr. Aboutaam said. ''That affects prices negatively. I think we could put an end to the new supply, and work comfortably with what we have.'' 
 Under such a moratorium, the Aboutaams and other established antiquities dealers would enjoy a significant advantage over newer competitors. Dealers in other periods of art are also feeling the same pressures. Already, works looted from Jewish family collections during the Nazi era, along with fakes and other stolen pieces, have rocked the art world. Just last month, the director Steven Spielberg discovered that he had purchased a 1967 oil on canvas by Norman Rockwell called Russian Schoolroom, which the Federal Bureau of Investigation asserts was stolen from a gallery in the 1970s. 
 Federal officials say they have no evidence that Mr. Spielberg, who bought that painting in 1989, was aware that the work had been stolen. 
 ''Although the specific issues vary across the art categories, the need to know where something has been is always important,'' said Judith Mann, a curator atthe St. Louis Art Museum, whose specialty is old masters. ''But very seldom are we fortunate enough to track down the history of an object to the moment it was made.''
 Mr. Aboutaam has also been repositioning Phoenix Ancient Art as a kind of activist among antiquities dealers. Works acquired by the gallery are now published in glossy bound journals, with color photographs and detailed descriptions of their artistic significance and provenance. Phoenix Ancient Art, which has added two provenance research assistants to its staff, has also begun building a database of antiquities to be located in a public antiquities research center it plans to open next year in Geneva, Mr. Aboutaam said.
 ''When all those things happened at the Getty and Met, people assumed, 'This is end of the antiquities trade because antiquities are evil,' '' Mr. Aboutaam said. ''But I think what happened has been good for the whole field.''
 Mr. Aboutaam is working with the Milken Institute, the economic research organization in Santa Monica, Calif., on a conference to be held in June to discuss the disparities in international treaties and laws affecting provenance and the antiquities market. Jared Carney, director of marketing and program development at the institute, said that discussing the woes of the art market is not standard fare for the organization.
 ''But what is right down the middle for us is looking at issues of social capital and the challenges of protecting intellectual property, and protecting assets and the pressure to preserve heritage,'' Mr. Carney said. ''You've got to give it to Hicham for trying to get a brand new take on things and coming at his challenges in a different way.'' 
 IN the end, Mr. Aboutaam said his efforts were simply to preserve the past for a world that should have access to it through beautiful cultural objects. At the moment he is excited about a statuette of Hera, the wife of Zeus. He is making sure that the history of the piece is rock solid. 
 Considered one of the finest classical statuettes in existence, it was found in Athens in the mid-19th century and owned by a series of French families, the last of which held it for 120 years. The Aboutaams acquired the work in Paris in 2005, and are currently negotiating with a potential buyer, ''an East Coast museum,'' Mr. Aboutaam said. 
 ''She will certainly be missed,'' he said of Hera. ''But in the end, we are all temporary custodians.''

HEADLINE: A Twisting Ride to the Web

BYLINE: By PETER SHEINBAUM; As told to Amy Zipkin.

 BODY:
MY life is like a quilt rather than a blanket. I need to collect experiences.
 My father died suddenly two and a half weeks before my college graduation. I had been staying with a friend when I got the call. I remember riding the train home from New York. It was the longest train ride of my life.
I hadn't taken my finals. I hadn't turned in my papers. My mom said, ''You have to go back and graduate.'' When we returned home after graduation she said, ''You can't forgo your dreams just because you've been handed a curveball.'' 
 I had a beat-up red Toyota truck I called Dusty. I had wanted to travel and had a recommendation to go to Alta, Utah. I loaded up the truck and went with my friend Chris. We got there in July. I was hired as a waiter. The season didn't start until November. I had never been out West and we saw all the national parks. We got chased by bears in Glacier National Park.
 In February a group of men came to Alta on a corporate trip. They were from Chemical Securities. One day I was out skiing and rode on the lift with one of them. He found out I had majored in economics and said, ''Maybe I should give you a job.'' He said to look him up if I was in New York. I called his office twice and then flew to New York for an interview at my expense. 
 I went back to Utah and waited five weeks and heard nothing. I had a job lined up as a river guide on the Salmon River in Idaho for the off-season. Just as I was ready to leave, I got a letter that said, ''We really want you in the training program.'' I decided the river would always be there.
 I was at Chemical two years as an analyst beginning in 1993 and turned down an associate position there to go to Lehman Brothers. My associate job at Lehman, which started in 1995, didn't require Internet access, but I got a modem and an account with a local provider. I'd work during the days and surf the Web at night.
 I saw that all the computer companies were in California I applied to graduate school and was rejected from Stanford and got into U.C.L.A. I left the bank in 1996 and took a four-month road trip as far north as Alaska before arriving in Los Angeles. 
 I had an internship at a Los Angeles Internet incubator my first year in grad school. It was no pay and long hours, and I took all the technology courses I could. Then E! Online hired me while I was in school to develop shop.eonline.com, which was my grad school thesis. I worked during the day and went to school at night for my last trimester. 
 After building shop.eonline, I was asked by another company to help them develop their e-commerce business. I quit E! and went to work for a husband and wife who ran their business in a garage, to help take it out of the garage. We moved into a 350-square-foot room in West Hollywood. The first day we had no phone service. 
 I went down to the basement to discover that some homeless person had torn all the wires out of the phone box. Over the course of the next couple of hours, instead of waiting for PacBell, I got the phones and D.S.L. working. The other offices in the building waited a week to have their phone service restored. I have always been reasonably capable of fixing things. 
 Seventy-five to 80-hour weeks were the norm. Then the Internet bubble burst and the venture capital money dried up at the beginning of 2000. The owners went back to the garage.
 I had worked for years without a break. I needed a life change. I was house-sitting for a friend in Destin, Fla., when I got a call from a friend who said, ''A good friend of mine, Dany Levy, is flying to Georgia to interview and hire a technology company to help her build a Web site.'' The name of her company was Dailycandy.com, a free daily e-mail bulletin about style, trends, fashion, food and culture, which then had no financing. So I got in the truck and drove seven hours to Atlanta.
 We sat in the lobby of the Hilton Hotel for three or four hours. She said: ''Come to the meetings with me. You know all the right questions.'' I was on the verge of moving to Colorado when I became the company's consultant. The first day we were live, we sent e-mail to 70 names. By the end of the first week, we had 700 names, and the end of the first year 35,000 names. Today we have over 2.4 million subscribers. Our growth was all virtual word of mouth.PETER SHEINBAUMChief executive, Dailycandy.comHOMETOWNWestport, Conn.FAVORITE PASTIMEChasing after dogs Sam and MaxGOAL ON REACHING 40Complete a full ironman triathlon

HEADLINE: In an Easter Dress, A Social Set Revealed

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

DATELINE: St. Louis 

 BODY:
WE accept by now that designer collections will whip in and out of style with the aerodynamic thrust of a race car running a lap at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. We understand that obsolescence is built in. We may wish at times that things were otherwise; sadly, they aren't. 
 And so, thanks in part to this dispiriting truth of the market, spirits may brighten when we come across a rare item whose existence rebukes the cult of novelty, some fine and simple product that seems never to change.
Who can say when the cherry dress came into being? People here can tell you only that it was always there. For 50 years the cherry dress has been the holiday uniform for the fine-featured towheads at places like the St. Louis Country Club or exclusive Midwestern summer resorts like Harbor Point or Charlevoix, Mich. For 50 years, the cherry dress has been a consistent best seller at the Woman's Exchange of St. Louis, a modest nonprofit shop and institution itself about as old as electrification, having opened its doors in 1883. 
 Come Easter, orders at the store are so strong for cherry dresses that Ellie Dressel, who sews them, says her leg is ''chained to the sewing machine.'' Ms. Dressel, a divorced mother who has supported a family and reared a mentally challenged son at home by sewing this one item (450 dresses a year, she said) for nearly a quarter-century, epitomizes the Horatio Alger principles behind the Woman's Exchange, which a 19th-century newspaper described as ''helping those who try to help themselves.'' 
 In classic form, the cherry dress is a simple box-pleat frock in white cotton, with a piped Peter Pan collar, a snap closure and four paired cotton cherries, in sewing terminology called yo-yos, stitched on the front.
 There are many variants, including a short-pants boy's version. A snapshot exists of John F. Kennedy Jr. as a toddler, wearing a cherry jumper from the St. Louis Woman's Exchange to accompany his mother to St. Edward Church in Palm Beach, Fla. It is the sort of picture, said Nancy Thomas, the president of the shop's volunteer board, that has caused at least one St. Louis man (her husband) to express relief that he never had sons. 
 WHAT is it about the cherry dress, one may ask? What was it about any of the simple preppy staples that turned into classics, things like penny loafers or blue blazers or button-down shirts?
 They functioned so well that people forgot to change them. They were so stylistically generic that, for a very long while, they escaped the tentacles of fashion. They were so reassuringly dowdy that they became background, no small point in a world where people still think that it is one who wears clothes and not the other way around. And they were durable. 
 ''There's a timeless quality to them, and they're dresses that you hold on to,'' Carrie Polk, one of four sisters with deep family roots in this river city, said of cherry dresses. ''Three generations in our family have worn them. They're like clothes from before the disposable-clothes era, with hems the size of Texas. You didn't just spill chocolate on one and pitch it. You got it cleaned and ironed, and if you grew, you brought down the hem.''
 A kiddie garment may seem a flimsy thing on which to hang a social history, but the cherry dress is sold in only one place in the world, and that place itself is a historical rarity, perhaps the largest among the remaining outposts of a once-thriving national network of nonprofit ''exchanges'' for women's work. 
 Of scores that existed at the height of the movement, there are now about 20 left, including outposts in Memphis, St. Augustine, Fla., and Brooklyn. The women's exchanges, voluntary social service agencies, originated in 19th-century Philadelphia as places for genteel ladies fallen on hard times to discreetly earn a living without leaving home. 
 ''Consignors were originally known as decayed gentlewomen,'' said the historian Kathleen Sander, whose book, ''The Business of Charity: The Woman's Exchange Movement, 1832-1900,'' traced the history of a social service federation whose feminist outlines were not always easy to detect behind the chintz-upholstered gentility of the exchanges themselves. Well into the 20th century, society women operated these tearooms and gift shops that sold everything from hand-painted china or smocked christening bonnets to knitted sweaters for dogs. It was the Civil War that propelled the woman's exchange movement, by depleting an entire marriageable generation of men, and forcing women of all economic backgrounds to leave home and forge careers. The percentage of unmarried women in the post-bellum period, Ms. Sander noted, was higher then than at any other time in American history. 
 ''The exchanges grew out of this tremendous economic insecurity,'' she said. That and a flourishing Decorative Arts movement -- introduced to the country at the Centennial Exposition of 1876 in Philadelphia -- helped revive skills largely lost to mass production. ''There were wonderful skills that had fallen through the cracks,'' Ms. Sander said. Marketing those skills became the mission of dozens of similar white-glove enterprises across the country, and helped keep the exchanges alive through the Great Depression and two World Wars. 
 For reasons lost to time, each exchange tended to develop its own particular products. The shuttered and much-lamented New York Exchange for Women's Work -- started in 1878 by Candace Wheeler, an interior designer, and Mary Atwater Choate, a prominent New Yorker who also founded the preparatory school now known as Choate Rosemary Hall -- made a specialty of smock dresses, bittersweet chocolate cakes and cod balls. (The exchange fell victim in 2003 to soaring real estate prices.) The Baltimore exchange became renowned for sock monkeys. St. Louis had the cherry dress. 
 Even as the populations of consigners shifted from genteel ladies down on their luck to new immigrants trying to find a toehold, the women's exchange in St. Louis stayed afloat, in the way that successful retailers do, by understanding its market. The city has an unusually robust country club scene and its members patronize the gift shop and tearoom as avidly as their mothers and grandmothers did. (The shop also attracts orders for children's clothes from people who live far from St. Louis, including Gwyneth Paltrow, according to the general manager, Jessica Wright.) Although the clientele has remained the same, the consignor profile has changed and many of the women (and men) who now make things for the exchange are not hard-up widows but immigrants from Bosnia, Somalia and Ethiopia. 
 ''The wonderful thing about the exchanges is how the managers keep thinking of ways to keep them afloat,'' Ms. Sander said. 
 Soon after Prohibition was repealed, for instance, the New York exchange got busy serving Manhattans to the socialites of the day at the so-called Crinoline Bar. The place attained the status of minor local legend, in part because of a retail strategy that encouraged clients to start the afternoon with a plate of chicken croquettes and a highball and then stick around to shop. 
 The formula is not so very different at the St. Louis exchange, although lamentably it serves no alcohol. Anachronistic the fashions there may be, but the tearoom menu is a record of stopped culinary time. ''I always remember the chicken salad sandwich,'' said Mary Frances Rand, a New Yorker whose St. Louis family once owned the largest shoe manufacturer in the world. ''It was very, very sweet and old-fashioned, even back when I made my debut,'' Ms. Rand said, adding that her debutante year was 1949.
 If the tearoom offerings have changed since then, it is not obvious how. A chicken salad sandwich is listed (''White Meat Only'') alongside the Euclid Avenue, an open-face sandwich of sliced tomatoes and crisp bacon smothered in Cheddar cheese. There, too, is a layered Lucky 7 Cake and the locally renowned Woman's Exchange Salad Bowl, an imposing ''medley'' (landslide is more like it) of julienned chicken breast, ham, Swiss cheese, tomato, hard-boiled egg, bacon, scallions and iceberg lettuce, topped with a dressing whose highly guarded secret ingredient would appear to be mayonnaise.
 And cholesterol, to be truthful, is an unwelcome and alien concept in the proper scheme of things. It is certainly one with little place in the charmingly timeless world of Lucky 7 Cake and piped cotton batiste. Sensible people both within and outside of St. Louis innately understand the appeal of this truth. It is why ''friends from all over, sophisticated friends,'' as Ms. Polk said, call asking her to order them cherry dresses each Easter. 
 ''They're so handmade and special,'' she added, and a certified bargain at $60. ''They're so vintage, really, they just never go out.''

HEADLINE: Sara Luft, Joshua Wechter

 BODY:
Sara Elena Luft and Joshua Zimmerman Wechter were married last evening at Temple Emanuel in Woodcliff Lake, N.J. Cantor Mark Biddelman performed the ceremony. 
 Mrs. Wechter, 26, is an associate specializing in financial services for the investment banking unit for Citigroup in New York. She graduated from Emory. 
She is a daughter of Deborah Merrigan and Stephen Luft of Oradell, N.J. Her father is the director of customer solutions at Opsec Security, a maker of identification cards and passports in Lancaster, Pa. Her mother is a professor of business and economics at Rockland Community College in Suffern, N.Y.
 Mr. Wechter, also 26, is an associate specializing in acquisitions for the Starwood Capital Group, a real estate investment firm in Greenwich, Conn. He has two undergraduate degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, one in history and the other in management. 
 He is a son of Alice and Thomas Wechter of Glencoe, Ill. His mother is an assistant to a portfolio manager at William Blair & Company, an investment banking firm in Chicago. His father is a partner in Schiff Hardin, a law firm in Chicago.
 The couple met in 1997 during their junior year of high school at a National Young Leaders Conference, a weeklong gathering in Washington of students from around the country. Though Ms. Luft and Mr. Wechter were in different groups, they shared the same bus for the week. 
 On the next-to-last day of the program, the couple ran into each other as they headed toward an elevator. Unknown to Ms. Luft, her skirt had somehow become tucked into her pantyhose. When the elevator door opened, she realized there was a problem. 
 ''I only noticed when everyone in the elevator was staring at my backside,'' Ms. Luft recalled. ''I quickly fixed the situation.''
 Later that day, when Ms. Luft boarded her bus, Mr. Wechter was the first person to tease her. They stayed up most of the evening, sitting outside the dorms on a curb, just talking. They agreed to stay in touch.
 ''I was very attracted to Sara when I first met her,'' Mr. Wechter said. ''She's got a very engaging personality. I thought about her all the way home.''
 When Ms. Luft got home, there was a message waiting for her.
 ''It was Josh, making sure I got home safely from my flight,'' she said. ''That was when we were 16 years old, and we've pretty much stayed together since.''

HEADLINE: A Surge in Foreclosure Filings

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
AFTER 20 years as a lawyer, David Volman has handled enough divorces to know that many marriages collapse under financial strain. So when his practice, in Shelton, began receiving an unusually large number of divorce cases last summer, Mr. Volman took it as an omen. ''Divorces go hand in hand with foreclosures and bankruptcies,'' he said. 
 Sure enough, in the first two months of this year, Mr. Volman took on some 50 bankruptcy cases, an ''enormous amount,'' he said, given that in all of 2006 he handled 19.
Many of the cases involve working-class couples in the Lower Naugatuck Valley who can no longer afford their mortgages. ''People are walking into my office and saying: 'Here are the keys. Do whatever you have to do. I just want to get out of this so I can sleep at night,' '' he said. 
 A slower housing market and the proliferation of risky mortgage products continue to drive up foreclosure rates across Connecticut. Preliminary figures for February gathered by RealtyTrac Inc., a national online marketplace for foreclosure properties, show a total of 1,451 foreclosure filings in Connecticut, a 61 percent increase over the corresponding period last year. 
 That surge followed a steep rise in January as well. The 1,287 foreclosure filings in Connecticut that month represented a 67 percent increase over January 2006, according to the company's figures. 
 These figures are consistent with a report issued by the Mortgage Bankers Association last week showing that the percentage of foreclosures initiated nationwide in the last three months of 2006 was the worst for any quarter since the group started reporting the numbers 37 years ago.
 ''Connecticut uses the same underwriting guidelines as everyplace else, so what's happening here is the same as what's happening in New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts,'' said Thomas Egan, president of the Connecticut Mortgage Bankers Association and a sales manager with Indymac, a mortgage company. ''Lending was just a little too loose, along with a real estate market that isn't growing.''
 RealtyTrac ranked Connecticut 17th in the nation for foreclosure rates in 2006 as a whole, with one foreclosure filing for every 118 households. Rates were higher in Windham County, in the northeast corner of the state (one for every 97 households), and New Haven County (one for every 105 households). The lowest rate was in affluent Fairfield County, with one for 124 households. 
 Filings alone do not necessarily translate into foreclosures. The filing is merely the first step in a process that could ultimately end in a repayment plan or modified loan rather than the loss of the home. 
 Connecticut's foreclosure filing rate is better than the rate for the nation over all. Nationwide, there was one filing for every 92 households last year, and foreclosure filings were up 42 percent over 2005. 
 Industry experts have linked rising default rates across the country to looser lending in the subprime market, which provides mortgages to people with poor credit or low income. Some were drawn in by initially low teaser rates, ''and then when the low-interest rate period ended, they got stuck and realized they can't pay the loan,'' said Steven Lanza, editor of The Connecticut Economy, a quarterly review published by the University of Connecticut. 
 So far, state-by-state data do not show a correlation between high rates of subprime lending and high rates of foreclosure, Mr. Lanza said. A correlation may appear over time, however, as more adjustable-rate mortgages are reset at higher interest rates, he added. 
 The more obvious correlation with high rates of foreclosure is rapid population growth, he noted. Many growing Western states have high foreclosure rates, even though they rank in the bottom third of states for the number of subprime loans. 
 ''In states where things aren't changing much, like Connecticut, people know people who know people,'' Mr. Lanza said. ''It's easier to check on their backgrounds and so forth. In fast-growing areas, there's a lot more anonymity. Everybody's new. That makes the job of bankers and other mortgage lenders more difficult.''
 Because subprime lending in Connecticut appears to be concentrated in urban areas, the rise in foreclosure filings raises concerns about deteriorating rates of home ownership in city neighborhoods, said Erin Kemple, executive director of the Connecticut Fair Housing Center in Hartford. 
 ''People have gotten into loans that have unaffordable terms,'' she said. ''We would call them predatory; not everyone would.''
 Last year, her agency received 28 complaints from people threatened with foreclosure. ''That's from, like, zero in 2005,'' Ms. Kemple said, ''and we continue to get three cases a week in 2007.''
 Two other nonprofit agencies offering foreclosure counseling -- Family Services Woodfield, in Bridgeport, and Neighborhood Housing Services, in Waterbury -- also report higher call volume. 
 In his Manchester law practice, State Representative Ryan Barry, who represents creditors in foreclosure proceedings, is seeing young people who took on burdensome mortgages without fully understanding the terms and are now trying to sell their homes at a price high enough to pay off the loans.
 As co-chairman of the State Legislature's Banks Committee, Mr. Barry also hears about homeowners who had been managing to scrape together their payments until an unexpected turn of events, like job loss or divorce, put them months behind.
 Mr. Barry has joined with housing advocates to try to resurrect an emergency mortgage assistance program that provided $4 million in emergency loans in 1994 and 1995 through the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority. The emergency loans essentially buy homeowners time to get back on their feet.
 Legislation approved by the committee would allocate another $5 million to the program, and amend it to make bank participation mandatory. The bill now goes to the Finance Committee. 
 A similar proposal died last year. Though lenders object to the mandatory aspect of the program, Mr. Barry, who also sits on the Finance Committee, said banks had indicated their willingness to ''work with me to make this a reality.''
 Surprisingly, one of the bill's vocal opponents is the housing finance authority, the quasi-public agency charged with increasing access to homeownership. During a recent public hearing, Carol DeRosa, an administrator at the authority, testified against reactivating the program, saying borrowers these days have enough ''loss mitigation'' tools at their disposal, both through her agency and private lenders. 
 Since 1994, ''the lending industry, as a whole, has changed,'' she said, ''recognizing that the last thing that mortgage companies and lenders want to do is to own property.'' The key, she said, is for borrowers to contact their lenders as soon as they run into financial difficulty and not wait until they miss several payments.

HEADLINE: After an Apartment Is Deregulated

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
Q. If the renewal rent on a rent-stabilized apartment goes from below $2,000 to above $2,000, my income for the last two years was over $175,000 each year and my landlord takes all of the appropriate steps to destabilize the apartment, will I be allowed to live out the term of my new lease?A. Yes, with one exception. Sherwin Belkin, a Manhattan lawyer who represents landlords, said that if the Division of Housing and Community Renewal issues an order of deregulation, the order deregulates the apartment upon the expiration of the tenant's current lease.
 ''The one exception is where the owner renews the lease while a luxury deregulation petition is pending before D.H.C.R.,'' Mr. Belkin said. In such a case, he said, if the owner attaches a notice to the renewal lease advising the tenant of the pending proceeding, and an order of deregulation is issued, the lease can be terminated 60 days after the order is issued.Can a Co-op Board Limit Rent Charged in a Sublet?Q. I own a co-op in New York, and I want to sublet my apartment. I understand that the board has the right to approve the sublet, to limit the number of people in the unit to two and to ask for or forgo a sublet fee. 
 In agreeing to approve the sublet, my board wants to limit the rent I collect to the amount of my monthly maintenance. I need to make $250 a month more than that, and I'm wondering why the board would not allow me to collect the additional money.A. Andrew Brucker, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer, said that most proprietary leases require board approval for sublets. And typically, he said, the board can make its approval of a sublet subject to certain conditions. One such condition, Mr. Brucker said, could be a limitation on the amount of rent charged. 
 He added that while it might seem odd for a board to limit the rent amount, there is probably a good reason for the board's action. ''Most co-op boards don't want their shareholders to be in the subletting business,'' he said, because they prefer to have as many shareholders in residence as possible and as few rental tenants. ''So while they might be willing to allow a shareholder to sublet,'' he said, ''they don't want them to get too comfortable doing so.''
 At the same time, Mr. Brucker said, not all proprietary leases allow the board to impose conditions for obtaining consent. So, he said, the letter writer should examine his proprietary lease to determine the extent of the board's power to control sublets.If a Rent-Controlled Tenant Is Evicted, What Then?Q. My neighbor's apartment was under rent control until he was evicted last month. Is the apartment now deregulated, and can the rent legally go to any price? I am interested because my own apartment is rent-controlled, and I'm worried that the landlord will do everything in his power to evict me.A. Luise A. Barrack, a Manhattan lawyer who represents landlords, said that if a tenant is evicted from a rent-controlled apartment, the apartment becomes subject to rent stabilization, and the landlord can increase the rent to the current market rate. 
 A couple of exceptions come into play. ''This is subject to the new tenant's right to file a 'fair market rent' appeal within 90 days if the building contains six units or more,'' Ms. Barrack said. If the rent is $2,000 or more and the tenant does not appeal, the apartment will be exempt from rent regulation.
 Ms. Barrack said that the letter writer should not be concerned about her rent-controlled status unless she gives the landlord a reason for evicting her. JAY ROMANO

HEADLINE: Texans Find Their Own Hamptons Equivalent

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

DATELINE: GALVESTON, Tex. 

 BODY:
IT was the seasickness that did it. After trying to sleep on her husband's boat after a long day of deep-sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico, Karen Wiseman had had enough. She was tired of nights spent sleeping off the coast of Galveston. She wanted a real home, on land.
 So Ms. Wiseman and her husband, Larry, started looking for a second home, a place they could use as both a weekend retreat and a rental property. The Wisemans, who live in Willis, Tex., 48 miles north of Houston and about 100 miles from Galveston Island, drove all over Galveston and were intrigued by East Beach, a lonely strip at the far eastern end of the island.
A small trailer with a sign out front was advertising Beachtown, a New Urbanist community of pastel-colored shorefront homes. The sales team inside told them that eventually up to 2,000 shore area homes would be built around three town squares with shops, parks and a lagoon. Andres Duany, a leading architect in the New Urbanism movement, had designed the project. The Wisemans liked what they saw. 
 Many fellow Texans feel the same way about Galveston. Houston residents, eager for a second home and flush with cash from the oil boom, have made Galveston Island an emerging Lone Star equivalent of the Hamptons. 
 In February 2005, the Wisemans bought three lots on the gulf for a total of $400,000. (They also bought a two-bedroom condominium in the Palisade Palms, a development now going up nearby, for $500,000. That unit will be rented out.) They spent $1 million building a five-bedroom house on the lots -- and in January, the house was ready. 
 ''It was a big investment for us, but it seemed so perfect,'' said Mrs. Wiseman, 46, whose husband, 50, owns a project-management company that often works with petroleum companies. ''We're glad we got in when we did,'' she said.
 Only 51 miles southeast of Houston, Galveston still has plenty of vacant land, low home prices and miles of wide-open beaches. Over the last four years, the average price of a home has risen 89 percent, to $232,800 in January, according to the Galveston Association of Realtors. Prices for water-view lots are now more than double what the Wisemans paid. A single water-view lot at Beachtown costs $300,000, though other lots without views could be as low as $80,000.
 ''The world has discovered the Gulf Coast,'' said James Gaines, research economist at the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. ''You want a second home on the East Coast at an affordable price, and you're not going to find anything. Here, it's still available and affordable.''
 The turnaround has been significant in a town that as recently as 10 years ago didn't have enough money to repave roads and install new water lines. Large-scale development had not happened since a hurricane destroyed much of the city in 1900, killing more than 6,000 people. 
 ''Galveston is experiencing a renaissance it hasn't seen in 100 years,'' said Jeffrey G. Sjostrom, president of the Galveston Economic Development Partnership. ''The beauty of the development is that it's comprehensive and diversified. Our eggs are being spread across many baskets.''
 The development seems to fly in the face of Galveston's geography. As a barrier island, the city can flood during tropical storms. Sometimes, its beaches erode. In September 2005, the city was evacuated when Hurricane Rita threatened the island. But home buyers keep coming because a large-scale hurricane has not damaged the island in more than 20 years.
 Developers are putting up condominium towers, resorts and acres of homes from one end of the 32-mile-long island to the other. More than 6,500 residential units are under construction; most of them are condos, according to the development partnership. At the western end of the island, Centex Homes is building one of the largest projects, a 1,000-acre development with 2,300 houses and condos. 
 More than $2.3 billion in commercial, public and residential projects are under way or planned. A new causeway linking the island to the mainland and one of the country's two laboratories to research emerging diseases are under construction. In the last three years, a new city convention center opened, and Moody Gardens, a complex of museums, water parks and botanical gardens, added a 125-room hotel wing and expanded its exhibition space. 
 The Port of Galveston calls itself the busiest in the gulf for cruise-ship traffic, thanks to a steady pace of renovations and expansions. After Carnival Cruise Lines decided to use Galveston as a home base for one of its ships, the Celebration, traffic there shot up, said Steven M. Cernak, the port's director. Last year, the port handled 616,198 disembarking passengers, up from 1,365 in 1999.
 The city is doing its part to welcome the development. It reorganized its planning department and introduced tax incentives for developers who put in infrastructure with their projects, like new roads, utilities and landscaping. The city signed a deal in February with Moody Gardens to renovate the municipal golf course for $14 million.
 Some residents are concerned, though, that the character of their island will be lost under the construction crane. They lobbied against a 16-story condominium tower on the west end of the island last fall, and their fierce opposition prompted the developer to drop his plans and the city to re-evaluate its master plan and height limits.
 ''We want to make sure we retain our character because that's what's attracted people here,'' said Wendy O'Donohoe, Galveston's director of planning and community development.
 Despite the opposition, the change has been striking. Randall Davis, a Houston developer of high-rise condominiums, said he wrote off the city 10 years ago, after his first project in town -- converting a downtown building into 40 lofts -- earned less than he had thought it would.
 But three years ago, he changed his mind and agreed to develop and market the Emerald by the Sea, a 15-story condominium tower in Galveston, for the landowner. When the condos sold out within a year, Mr. Davis knew that Galveston had changed.
 ''It made me realize there's a huge demand,'' Mr. Davis said.
 By the end of this month, Mr. Davis expects to break ground on his second project in Galveston, a seven-story resort he modeled after his favorite hotel, the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles. This project, Diamond Beach Resort & Spa, will have pink and white walls, a private beach, indoor and outdoor swimming pools and 230 condos with gulf views. Prices are expected to range from $475,000 for a two-bedroom to $850,000 for a three-bedroom.
 At the other end of the island, Tofigh Shirazi, president of Intercontinental United Investors in Houston, said he had remained committed to Galveston despite years of setbacks wading through complex city permits and reworking his project. After buying land on East Beach 14 years ago, Mr. Shirazi finally broke ground last summer on his Beachtown project and has already sold all the 133 single-family lots in the development's first phase. He is about to start construction on 27 town-home lots. Another phase is to add 48 lots.
 Next to Beachtown, the Falcon Group, a commercial and residential developer in Houston, is building Palisade Palms, two 27-story condominium towers. They will be the tallest buildings in town when they are completed next January. (The east end is more sparsely occupied than the west, so there was no opposition to the towers.) The project's 288 condos, which cost $445,000 to $1.5 million, have views of the gulf or Galveston Bay. Around 90 percent have been sold. The developer said it expected to put up to 1,500 units over the next decade.
 ''What we're able to offer the five million people one hour away is not necessarily emerald seas and salty sands, but convenience,'' said Richard Anderson, the Falcon Group's vice president for development. ''You can pack the car with your kids or grandkids and be on the beach in an hour.''

HEADLINE: Is Paying Off a Loan a Good Idea?

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
AS many homeowners dip into their home equity, a small but growing number are doing the opposite -- paying off their mortgages quicker than lenders require. 
 But is ending a mortgage sooner than necessary a wise move? There's no simple answer. Financial advisers disagree sharply about whether, and when, such an approach makes sense.
''I talk with clients about this every day, probably five, six times a day,'' said Jonathan Satovsky, an investment adviser in Manhattan with Ameriprise Financial, a financial management company based in Minneapolis. Mr. Satovsky generally warns his clients against prepaying. 
 First, he said, assuming that the homeowner has a 6.25 percent fixed-rate mortgage and is in the 20 percent income-tax bracket, the net interest rate -- after mortgage interest is deducted on tax returns -- is about 4 percent. Although homeowners would save that 4 percent by paying off their mortgages, he said, they would earn more than 4 percent interest if they invested the money instead.
 ''There might be periods where the markets go backward, and you think it's a mistake,'' he said. ''But over 10, 15 years, they'll earn a lot more by not prepaying.'' 
 In addition, he said, because mortgage interest is front-loaded, the interest deduction drops sharply in the later years of the mortgage.
 Andrew Schweitzer, the chief executive of the Gulfstream Financial Corporation, an advisory service in Sunrise, Fla., disagreed. ''The goal should be to free up earned income so you can accumulate it for retirement,'' he said. ''If I'm paying $24,000 a year on a mortgage, I may have saved $8,000 a year in taxes. But if I didn't have a mortgage, I would have saved $24,000 in overall expenses. It's not rocket science.'' 
 By clearing the debt earlier, you pay much less over all in interest over the life of the loan, and free that money for investment.
 Mr. Schweitzer's company sells a service that essentially uses clients' money to pay bills on their behalf, choosing debts with the highest interest rates first. Typical clients, he said, have about $120,000 in annual household income and carry about $120,000 in debt, from cars, mortgages, home-equity credit lines and credit cards.
 With the service, Mr. Schweitzer said, assuming the clients spend the same amount but stop using credit cards, their total debt, including mortgages, is typically paid off within eight years. The average client, he said, saves about $200,000 in interest by paying off the debt in less than the full period allowed and pays Gulfstream $1,500 for the service.
 Clients can save and invest their money for retirement, he said, and achieve financial independence more quickly than they would have while carrying debt.
 (There is an important caveat -- some mortgages carry prepayment penalties, which can total thousands of dollars, so borrowers should check with their lenders for details.)
 Other services offering guidance, like PlasticEconomy.com's Track Cards, help homeowners choose which debts to pay off first but do not manage the client's money directly and typically do not include mortgage payments.
 Should homeowners choose to prepay their mortgages, Mr. Satovsky of Ameriprise suggests they take out a home-equity line of credit before they begin. ''Prepaying is dangerous,'' he said, if the homeowners' equity is completely locked into the value of the house and they are not disciplined savers.
 ''You could have $2 million in equity in the home and say you're ready to retire,'' he said. ''I say: 'Great! What will you live on? Social Security? You spend $20,000 a month.' '' 
 If the homeowner then becomes disabled or unemployed, he may not qualify for a home-equity loan when he needs money, Mr. Satovsky said.

HEADLINE: Tall and Thin, Back in Fashion

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL. 
E-mail: bigdeal@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE sliver building is making a comeback in Midtown Manhattan. The version that Ismael Leyva has designed will soon soar above Eighth Avenue and West 48th Street like a bird made of blue glass, with narrow balconies rising 42 stories high along the neck.
 During an earlier residential building boom in the 1980s, New York City rushed to ban what were called ''slivers'' -- condominium towers rising high above narrow lots in residential neighborhoods -- in response to community protests. In 1983, even as the last vote was taken, developers were still running crews on overtime to try to get their foundations finished on the Upper East Side, before it was too late.
At the time, the City Planning Commission attributed the slivers to what are again familiar trends: rising real estate values, the demand for luxury housing and the difficulties developers were having assembling large lots. 
 But now with residential condominiums going up all over Manhattan -- in commercial districts like this one on Eighth Avenue as well as residential neighborhoods -- the sliver is back, and Mr. Leyva's version is singularly tall, thin and contemporary. It has a needlelike tower rising above a 23-foot-8-inch-wide street front. 
 In all, the condominium tower, at 785 Eighth Avenue, will rise 566 feet high, according to the building permit, and cantilever over an adjacent building to provide additional floor space. Balconies facing Eighth Avenue will be spaced to create a sense of motion like a bird in flight -- because they shift from one side of the building to the other as they rise along the facade.
 ''When developers are forced to deal with small sites, we architects have to come up with clever solutions to make the building more efficient and economically feasible,'' said Mr. Leyva, who designed the residential interiors at the Time Warner Center, and has been involved in dozens of other residential and commercial projects in the region. 
 ''We have to shape the building to maximize the use of space, create drama with dynamic solutions,'' he said. 
 The project, being developed by Esplanade Capital, a New York real estate and investment company, calls for 122 condominiums, with two to four apartments per floor, a residential lobby and entrance on West 48th Street, a rooftop terrace, amenities space, and a retail space in the ground floor and basement. There will be two elevators stopping at each floor.
 The building uses air rights from several adjacent properties and is built on an irregularly shaped lot. So while it is 23 feet wide in front, it widens out to 44 feet at the rear, providing large balconies and corner living rooms facing the Hudson River. It is scheduled to be completed in mid-2008.
 The limits on sliver buildings apply to structures in residential zoning districts with street fronts of 45 feet or less. A review of building dimensions in property tax records shows two 20-story buildings with only 25 feet of street frontage in Midtown, but no other building as tall as this new project with as little street frontage.
 Jay Eisenstadt, who runs Esplanade with his partner, David Scharf, said he was aware of other projects being planned on relatively narrow lots in Manhattan, and he noted that other very tall condominiums have been built or are being built along Eighth Avenue. 
 ''It is a unique and challenging site, and it will be a unique building,'' he said.
 But Kent L. Barwick, the president of the Municipal Art Society, which opposed the sliver buildings in the 1980s, said he remained concerned about their resurgence in commercial areas. 
 ''This should be a big red flag for anybody who thought the sliver buildings had disappeared from New York,'' he said. ''We hope this will get city planning and property owners in this part of town together to make sure that this is what everybody had in mind.''Going Once, Going Twice 
 THE three sons of the late psychiatrist Edward J. Hornick could never agree on what do with the six-and-a-half-story mansion he left to them at 11 West 73rd Street, once their mother died a few years ago. 
 Each loved the house in his own way, but that was where the disagreements began. So they argued about it, then hired lawyers and went to court and fought some more. 
 Then, when each knew he had to sell the house, the brothers couldn't even agree on how to do it, and who should pay the broker's commission. All the while the value of the property -- 9,500 square feet including two below-ground floors, a manually operated elevator and a roof deck -- kept rising. 
 Finally, last December, a state judge ordered that the 20-foot-wide house -- with relief sculptures of Sigmund Freud and Franklin Delano Roosevelt (smoking a cigarette in a holder) incorporated into the facade by their father, a bohemian psychoanalyst and clinical psychiatrist with a flair for the extravagant -- be sold at auction at the courthouse within 90 days.
 But the story has a happy ending. The brothers began to work together once more. The ingredient that brought them back together was money, more money than at least some of the brothers had ever expected to get out of the house.
 After the auction was ordered, two of the brothers, Joshua and Andrew Hornick, hired a broker, Dexter Guerrieri, the principal of Vandenberg Inc., to hold open houses, stage the house and help market it, in order to attract affluent buyers who might be unfamiliar with auction techniques usually used in mortgage foreclosures. They thought they would more than make back the commission they would have to pay, through a higher sale price. The third brother, Peter, objected to the hiring.
 Mr. Guerrieri had originally estimated the value of the house at $7 million, according to court papers, but when he showed it to buyers, he indicated that he expected it to fetch anywhere from $5.5 million to $8.5 million. Buyers were told that the house could be sold only at auction.
 But several buyers offered to pay cash up front if the auction were called off, and Mr. Guerrieri forwarded the offers to the owners. In late February, Fine Times Inc., a real estate developer specializing in restoring town houses and brownstones, offered them $8 million.
 The brothers all agreed, and they went back to Justice Jane S. Solomon of the New York State Supreme Court with a copy of the signed contract and asked her permission to call off the auction. On March 7, she agreed and approved the sale. 
 Joseph Lopez, a principal of Fine Times, said that the company planned to renovate and restore the building, but that it had not decided whether to convert it into luxury rentals or condominiums or to sell it as a mansion for a single affluent family. 
 But he said Freud and Roosevelt would remain, along with the cigarette holder. ''They will stay,'' he said. ''They are a recognized part of the building.''There's Room for Picassos
 CLAUDE RUIZ-PICASSO, the only surviving son of Pablo Picasso, who has devoted much of his life to administering his father's estate and to managing the rights to the reproduction, marketing and merchandising of the artist's name and work, has bought a sprawling prewar duplex apartment at 33 West 67th Street for $3.25 million, property records show.
 Mr. Ruiz-Picasso's mother is Francoise Gilot-Salk, a French artist who was Mr. Picasso's companion for about a decade, beginning when she was 21 and he was 62, until she left him in 1953. She later married Jonas Salk, the developer of the first successful polio vaccine. 
 In the closing documents, Mr. Ruiz-Picasso gave his current address in care of his mother in the building next door, 27 West 67th Street, a famous co-op built in 1903 with double-height north-facing studios specifically for artists, on the site of old stables.
 Mr. Ruiz-Picasso's apartment will have plenty of wall space for artwork. It has a living room with 17-foot ceilings, according to the listing by Liz Nelson, an agent with the Corcoran Group, with huge double-height windows, four bedrooms and an eat-in kitchen in a building dating to 1904. The $3.25 million sales price was 15 percent below the original asking price last August. 
 Mr. Ruiz-Picasso may have gotten a better deal than Tom Brokaw, the former news anchor. Mr. Brokaw paid slightly more, $3.267 million, for an apartment on a lower floor of the same building. 
 That apartment was owned by the late Barbara Epstein, a founding editor of The New York Review of Books. Both contracts were signed in late January, according to property records.

HEADLINE: Solace From a Multiethnic Tapestry

BYLINE: By EMILY BRADY

 BODY:
JULIO CANCEL, an unemployed cook, stood silently in front of the makeshift shrine of flickering candles, stuffed bears and handwritten notes for the 10 victims of the house fire on Woodycrest Avenue in the Highbridge section of the Bronx. 
 His soulful brown eyes settled on a new sign that proudly announced how much money the neighborhood had raised for the Magassa and Soumare families, the Malians who lost relatives to the flames: $26,049.12.
''Thank you! Together, Highbridge United,'' read the handwritten sign. 
 Mr. Cancel, a 28-year-old Puerto Rican who grew up in Hunts Point, stood back and smiled. ''It feels so good,'' he said of his part in helping to collect the money.
 During the hectic days after the horrific fire on March 7, Mr. Cancel and a group of like-minded neighbors stationed themselves outside the gray single-family home of the extended Magassa family, directly across the street from the row house that had been consumed by flames. Their leader was a Puerto Rican woman with fluorescent red hair and eyebrows to match named India Echevarria. With hordes of onlookers and journalists milling about, they acted as a sort of security force for those grieving inside and collected donations for the bereaved families in empty plastic water jugs, one bill at a time.
 Because of the fire, the little-known Malian community in Highbridge, a low-income neighborhood perched on a hill north of Yankee Stadium, has suddenly been illuminated by a sad spotlight. Less well known is the fact that the neighborhood is home to a fusion of cultures, where people living in close quarters speak everything from Spanish, French and Bengali to the African languages of Soninke and Akan.
 Many of the city's ethnic groups live in enclaves. But in a growing number of New York neighborhoods, these groups overlap to form a complex tapestry populated by families from vastly different backgrounds. Sometimes these families coexist peaceably, sometimes indifferently. But when the fire burned down the Woodycrest Avenue row house, members of a broad range of ethnic groups rallied to help.
 It could have happened to any of them. Next to the burnt shell is a house with a scorched awning. Neighbors say it belongs to a family of Mexicans who are out of town and probably unaware of the tragedy. If the fire had broken out a few doors down, it would have enveloped a three-story wooden house with a wide porch owned by a Jamaican family. Across on the west side of the street stand three-story apartment buildings occupied by African-Americans, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans.
 ''This neighborhood is full of different nationalities, but they get along,'' said Christopher Al-Saidi, a Yemeni-American who works at his family's bodega, Shady Moon Deli and Grocery, on Nelson Street at 167th Street, three blocks from the site of the fire. ''Sometimes Africans come, and they only know how to speak French. But then they'll come back with an English-speaking family member.'' 
 According to the 2000 census, a third of the neighborhood's 33,800 residents are foreign-born. Forty-one percent of the neighborhood lives below the poverty level, and the residents are united by the fact that so many of them are just scraping by.
 AS recently as 25 years ago, the neighborhood was home mainly to African-Americans, Puerto Ricans and burnt-out buildings. Today, old-timers have been joined by immigrants from around the globe: Dominicans, Jamaicans, Mexicans, Bangladeshis, Ghanaians, Nigerians and Malians, among others. Yet despite the great disparities between their roots, their values and their lifestyles, these groups coexist in generally friendly fashion. 
 ''Even if you can't communicate verbally with someone, you recognize everyone in the neighborhood and you say hi,'' said Chauncy Young, a self-described Spanish-speaking ''Irish-Italian mutt'' and educational organizer with the Highbridge Community Life Center, a social service agency.
 Along Woodycrest Avenue, the Magassa and Soumare families were known by their large brood of children.
 Mr. Cancel, the cook, who often hangs out under the blue and yellow awning of Castillo's market, at Woodycrest and 165th Street, knew seven of the 17 children who lived in the house that was destroyed. Mahamadou Magassa, a feisty 8-year-old, used to try to cajole free candy out of the cashier at the counter, he said. 
 Mr. Cancel remembers that they'd buy 25-cent cookies or a small cake at the market that they would then divide up equally and with great earnestness among themselves. Sometimes he gave them his spare change.
 Exchanges were less frequent with the parents, mothers draped in lengths of colorful fabric, and fathers working long hours as a cabdriver and an owner of an import-export business. 
 ''We would acknowledge them, but we wouldn't really talk with them,'' Mr. Cancel said. ''They didn't speak English.'' 
 Sometimes the mixing of cultures can result in greater understanding. This was the case for Victoria Rodriguez, a longtime Highbridge resident who counsels newly arrived immigrants and local residents about housing and adult education at the Highbridge Community Life Center.
 Ms. Rodriguez, a 58-year-old mother of three and grandmother of 10, remembers looking up from her desk one day a few years ago and seeing Fatoumata Soumare, the 42-year-old woman who perished in the fire, walking toward the office with a baby strapped to her back. The wrap holding the baby was fastened with only a knot, and Ms. Rodriguez was terrified that it would slip apart and the baby would fall to the ground.
 ''I thought, 'Oh, my God, look at that woman with a baby on her back!' '' Ms. Rodriguez recalled. ''Is she crazy?''
 When the woman came in to inquire about English classes, Ms. Rodriguez voiced her concern, and Ms. Soumare calmly explained that it was an African custom to carry babies in such wraps. 
 ''She enlightened me that day,'' Ms. Rodriguez said. ''What I realized is that I need to keep an open mind.''

HEADLINE: Daring to Bet That Americans Would Take a Shine to Imports

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
FOR more than a year, my father has been driving around Boulder, Colo., in a Toyota Prius. This might seem like an odd development for a man whose career as a foreign car dealer was defined in many ways by a bitter lawsuit with Toyota in the 1960s, but it spotlights some of the reasons Toyota is poised to pass General Motors as the world's largest carmaker.
 My father, Richard W. Feder, was Toyota's first dealer in San Francisco when the Japanese company returned to the United States in 1964 with the Corona compact after analyzing why Americans had rejected its underpowered Toyopet in the late 1950s.
That Feder-Toyota relationship did not last long -- Dad did not buy into the company's drive to increase sales rapidly at the expense of near-term profits -- but he never stopped admiring Toyota's focus on improving quality. When the company eventually expanded its engineering efforts into hybrid technology and other advances that represented the kind of forward thinking Dad loved in European cars, he was ready to become a customer. 
 Given the globalization of business, it may seem inevitable in hindsight that Toyota and other foreign carmakers have emerged as big forces in the economy, with factories scattered around the United States. But that development, unimaginable when Dad's generation returned home from World War II, still seemed far-fetched in the 1960s when he began selling Toyotas. It was not until 1978 that Volkswagen became the first foreign carmaker to open an American factory in the postwar era. Dad entered the business in 1955 as a partner in a struggling BMW-Mercedes dealership. A year later he bought control of the new-car side of the business, which he renamed Executive Motors. 
 Max Hoffman, a New York-based distributor of European cars, and other pioneers like Kjell Qvale, a Norwegian immigrant who brought Volkswagen and numerous British marques to San Francisco, had mapped the niches where entrepreneurs could survive in the import-car business: Old World prestige (Rolls-Royce, Bentley), fun and speed (MG, Porsche) and extreme practicality (Volkswagen). The common thread among import customers was a taste for novelty. 
 Mr. Qvale said that pioneering dealers had to demonstrate years of business success before American banks would support loans or leases attached to the imports. 
 ''We even struggled getting people to insure them,'' said Mr. Qvale, who is now 86. 
 Executive Motors started out in a small building on Van Ness Avenue, San Francisco's auto row, as a Mercedes, Maserati and BMW dealership; Citroen was soon added. Dad's landlord was the gentlemanly Ellis Brooks, whose mammoth Chevrolet dealership up the street showcased all that seemed impregnable about the domestic car industry. After a few years Executive Motors moved to a small showroom on the west flank of Nob Hill to save on rent. But Dad was confident about the future.
 ''You could see what was going to happen to G.M., Ford and Chrysler,'' Dad said recently. ''They had already ceded quality and innovation to the imported cars.''
 An oversimplification from a biased source? Sure, but Executive Motors provided a window on the social and economic forces that fueled the success of importers like Toyota -- and the failures of others. 
 In addition to the early relations with Mercedes and BMW and the ties to Citroen that lasted until that French company left the United States in 1974, Executive Motors sold Rover and Land Rover. It brought Saab to San Francisco before that Swedish carmaker was ready to support an official dealership by acquiring two-stroke models in Denver. It took a pioneering stab at Subaru, which Dad dropped after its models at the time (with two-stroke engines in the rear of the cars) proved unsellable.
 In addition, Executive Motors enjoyed the dubious, unprofitable distinction of dealing in such obscure marques as Glas (''the poor man's Porsche''), Stanguellini (a racing car that never made a successful transition to consumer sports car) and the Janus (a microcar from Zundapp, a German motorcycle maker, with a mid-mounted engine and a body almost identical at the front and the rear).
 And Dad -- who else? -- was the San Francisco dealer for Amphicar, which for all its innovative features performed dismally as both a car and as a boat. 
 All in all, the track record was long on color and short on shrewdness. Still, just as Dad anticipated when he chose Toyota over the simultaneous opportunity to become San Francisco's first Datsun dealer, the Corona began to catch on. Its four doors and design touches struck buyers as a step up from Volkswagen. And its reliability offered better value than shoddy domestic compacts like the Nash Rambler. The smaller Corolla also looked promising when it arrived in 1968. But when Toyota pressed Dad to move back to Van Ness and bet his future on high-volume sales at lower profit margins, Dad was not willing to take that risk. ''I thought it was premature,'' he said recently. 
 In truth, the time might never have seemed right to him for such a move. His heart belonged to imports at the leading -- or, all too often, outer -- edge of design, especially Citroen. Once a car and the customers seeking it became less than exotic, Dad seemed to lose his taste for selling it.
 Toyota did not waste long arguing with him about its prospects. It set up a competing dealer. The relatively small sum it had to pay Dad to end the subsequent litigation was probably a sound business investment.
 The outcome made it clear that Dad was not on the path of import titans like Mr. Qvale, who ended up owning more than 100 dealerships. And it underscored how rapidly the world of imports was changing. Toyota came to Dad because it had little choice. When Honda moved into San Francisco less than a decade later, its first dealership went to a prominent Pontiac dealer.
 Meanwhile, Executive Motors puttered into the 1980s as an extreme example of the sometimes offbeat enterprises that gave the imported car business its first foothold in the United States. The wealth it produced was mostly stories, like run-ins with the California Highway Patrol over the Amphicar's lighting (''But it's exactly what the Coast Guard requires,'' was Dad's successful defense in court) or dealings with unconventional customers (Note to Jack Casady, bass player for the Jefferson Airplane at the time he bought a Citroen: Dad's under the impression that you still owe him money, but I think we're all square because you got us into the Wally Heider Studio one night when both the Airplane and the Grateful Dead were recording.) 
 Naturally, I emerged from such an upbringing with an endearingly strange car -- a 1971 Citroen Dyane, a larger, slightly more powerful version of the flimsy 2CV.
 Today, though, I drive a Toyota Sienna van. And Peter Watkins, Dad's longtime accountant and salesman, recently replaced his Toyota-made Scion with a Prius. ''Once they came back, there was never a year when Toyota put out a bad car,'' Mr. Watkins said. ''The sickening part of what happened to Ford and G.M. is that they have good cars now, but nobody trusts them.''

HEADLINE: They Break for Summer

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BLEYER. 
E-mail: streetlevel@nytimes.com

 BODY:
JAMES GISANTE peered out the window of the Island Cafe on City Island Avenue during lunchtime on Tuesday, taking in all the clangorous machinery outside. Dump trucks rumbled over holes in the ground, backhoes kicked up thick clouds of dust and giant excavators stood ready for action.
 ''It's horrible,'' complained Mr. Gisante, a husky and garrulous 54-year-old sanitation worker who has lived on City Island for 35 years. ''If you don't have to be on the avenue, don't.'' 
City improvement projects, while often regarded as irritating while they are going on, are usually considered valuable in the long run. And most City Islanders would agree that the $22 million project to replace the island's sewers and water mains will be a benefit for their placid maritime community. 
 ''It needs to be done,'' said Mr. Gisante, and any doubters can find proof in the 80-year-old water pipes whose innards are caked with sediment and debris, and in the dangerously intertwined systems that handle sewage and storm drainage.
 But a clock is ticking on City Island. From the island's crowded marinas to its venerable seafood restaurants to its wood-frame buildings weathered to paleness by the salty air, the local economy revolves around tourism, and the summer tourist season is, in residents' eyes, just around the corner. 
 ''We have three months to make our money before it gets cold and it's over,'' said Maura Mandrano, a co-owner of the 34-slip Sailmaker Marina. 
 Therein lies the problem. The huge sewer project, which has disrupted traffic on City Island Avenue, the island's main artery, could cause serious problems for this mainstay industry. That threat has led to a delicate dance between the city and area residents. 
 Aware of the island's special character, the city's Department of Design and Construction, which is overseeing the project, installed a full-time community liaison, Andrew Macagnone, in 2004. Ever since work began last March, and especially after it moved onto City Island Avenue in September, Mr. Macagnone has been distributing newsletter updates, posting fliers and chatting on the sidewalk with local residents. 
 ''My presence is to let people know that a big elephant hasn't just landed in their yard,'' Mr. Macagnone said. ''We try to minimize the inconvenience.''
 The stakes are highest on City Island Avenue, a 1.5-mile stretch lined with restaurants and boatyards. On summer weekends, traffic on the three-lane road is jammed, with nearly 3,000 cars a day. 
 ''If they didn't stop in the summertime, it would cause chaos,'' said Jeffrey Weiner, the general manager of Sammy's Fish Box on the avenue, and of two other local restaurants. ''We do 70 percent of our business in summer months. The busiest day of the year is Mother's Day. We want as smooth an operation as possible.'' 
 In response, the city plans to suspend work on the avenue from mid-May to Labor Day, putting its backhoes and other equipment to work on the neighborhood's smaller streets during that time. The hope is that the entire project will be completed by the fall of 2008. 
 But there is still grumbling from some quarters. 
 ''I'd love to see it just get done,'' said Barbara Dolensek, the recording secretary of the City Island Civic Association and one of the island residents who have some doubts about the summertime moratorium. For years before the construction began, she said, ''everybody was kind of dreading it.'' Now, she added, ''many residents would like them to work through the summer and be done with the whole thing.'' 
 At the Sailmaker Marina, Ms. Mandrano, too, is unhappy. Her business sits on one of the smaller streets that are scheduled for the summertime construction work.
 ''It would be an unpleasant project at any time of the year, but why in May, June and July?'' she asked, adding that the owners of the boats docked at the Sailmaker would be getting an unfair deal.
 ''For the restaurants, it's great,'' she said of the eateries on City Island Avenue. ''It all worked out for them. 
 ''In general,'' she added, ''I don't approve of the moratorium, but if there is a moratorium, I think we should be in on it, too.''

HEADLINE: 'Idol' Has Vocal Disasters? You Should Hear This One

BYLINE: By SYLVIANE GOLD

 BODY:
Back in 1944, $2.40 would have bought you a ticket to Carnegie Hall to hear Florence Foster Jenkins, the hideously unmusical society matron who thought she could sing. 
 This month, it will cost you at least $44 to see Liz McCartney pretend to be her at the George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick.
It appears at first to be a severe case of artistic inflation. But it's actually a great deal. Because when Ms. McCartney, plumped and permed and dressed to the dowager nines, takes the stage, you get a lot more for your money. 
 For one thing, she is doing more than singing badly. Stephen Temperley's ''Souvenir: A Fantasia on the Life of Florence Foster Jenkins'' is a real play, not just an extended off-key joke. Although the only other character is Jenkins's coach and accompanist, a failed composer named Cosme McMoon, Mr. Temperley is less interested in the laughs derived from their performances -- though he includes plenty -- than he is in the mysteries implied by their relationship.
 Those mysteries begin, of course, with music. Cosme, played with wry understatement by Jim Walton, characterizes singing as ''dreaming in public.'' But you could describe listening the same way. Do we know what really happens in the brain after the creation of a sound and its arrival at the ear? When the supremely confident Flo claims artistic ''latitude'' for her singing, how much is too much? And who decides what is beautiful?
 Mr. Walton's Cosme keeps wondering what his hapless employer was hearing as she butchered some of the most gorgeous vocal music ever written. Clearly it was vastly superior to what the rest of us hear as Ms. McCartney, in a magnificent subversion of her own talent, yowls through bravura arias by Mozart and Verdi and Gounod and through less transcendent stuff like ''Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition.'' But think about it: Can we ever even guess what another person is hearing? 
 As Cosme reminisces about Flo from the piano bench of the New York supper club where he earns his living 20 years after her death, we watch his feelings grow over their 12-year round of rehearsal and recital. Their association begins as pure expediency; he desperately needs a paying job. It develops into a wary friendship and then deepens into not just appreciation but something akin to love. So questions about music and art recede as more universal ones -- about compassion and truth -- come to the fore. How much honesty do we owe our friends? Can we love others without being complicit in their illusions? What, in the end, is loyalty? 
 ''Souvenir'' is not a work of history, and Mr. Temperley's tender investigation into the ties that bind Cosme and Flo is speculation. After hearing her sing for the first time, Cosme tells Flo that he detects ''a certain want of accuracy,'' and the same could be said of the play. But only the most obsessed Florence Foster Jenkins fans -- and thanks to her recordings, they're out there -- would object to the liberties Mr. Temperley has taken with the facts. 
 Theatergoers with less specialized tastes, however, would be justified in wishing he were less generous with the musical interludes. The audience for ''American Idol'' may disagree, but a little cringe-inducing singing goes a long, long way. ''Souvenir,'' which has been crisply directed by Anders Cato and elegantly designed by Karl Eigsti, could be shortened to 90 minutes with no significant loss. (It now runs more than two hours with intermission.) I'd start by reducing the copious number of excerpts from the infamous Carnegie Hall recital; they're there less to propel the story than to display Jenkins's egregious taste in costumes, amusingly reinterpreted by Tracy Christensen.
 That concert, which occurred about a month before Jenkins died, at the age of 76, was a sellout. If legend and Mr. Temperley's play are to be believed, tickets were being scalped for $20 outside the hall. That makes the George Street production even more of a bargain. With Jenkins herself, audiences got only bad singing and the opportunity to feel superior. With Ms. McCartney and Mr. Walton, they get bad singing and the opportunity to feel.''Souvenir: A Fantasia on the Life of Florence Foster Jenkins,'' by Stephen Temperley, is at the George Street Playhouse, 9 Livingston Avenue, New Brunswick, through March 25.

HEADLINE: The Irish Are Like the English? Not!

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''A Wee Identity Crisis'' (Op-Ed, March 11):
 At the same time I mentally applauded the notion of a human family with more similarities than differences, it was rather shocking to read Alexander McCall Smith's characterization of the centuries of brutal English rule over the Irish as ''a much-resented indignity,'' which seems to imply that the Irish merely had their national pride hurt.
 The Irish were prohibited from owning land, from education, from practicing the religion of their choice, from government jobs, indeed from voting, and ultimately, during the potato blight, a right to basic food and shelter. It took armed rebellion with much loss of life to break from the English, rather than merely asserting their independence, as Mr. McCall Smith would have it. 
 While it is true that ''the Irish had no doubt, it seemed, that they were a separate people,'' this came from centuries of treatment as inferior human beings and being used as underpaid and underfed laborers and entertainers; the songs referred to in the article were a way to hand down history when they were deprived of the means to write or publish.
 While he may write from Scotland, Mr. McCall Smith has a decidedly English slant on history. Peggy TierneyTerre Haute, Ind., March 12, 2007To the Editor:
 The March 6 Science Times article about genetic similarity between the Irish and the English (''A United Kingdom? Maybe'') prompted opinion articles about how the Scots and the Irish react to this information (''A Wee Identity Crisis,'' by Alexander McCall Smith; and ''When English Eyes Are Smiling,'' by Wes Davis, Op-Ed, March 11). 
 But it should be borne in mind that there is little doubt that the Celtic Tiger has altered the paradigm shifts in Irish-English relationships on all levels. An emotional example was the recent rugby game between the two countries at Croke Park, Dublin. 
 Therefore, I await the opinion article about how the English feel being related to us. Nicholas FarrellRichmond, Va., March 11, 2007To the Editor:
 Our founding fathers did not fight the American Revolution because of genetic differences with the English. Irish and Scottish people know the differences between themselves and the English and have probably never assumed that they were due to genetic differences.
 They know that their traits of humility, compassion, humor and fire are due to the unique circumstances of their environment and cultures. 
 Thankfully, this is the case for most peoples, as England on its own has created much disorder throughout the world over the years because of its arrogance and lack of humility (see Iraq, Northern Ireland, Palestine-Israel, India-Pakistan, the Falkland Islands and South Africa) for which we are all still paying and will for a long time to come. Patrick KissaneBronx, March 12, 2007To the Editor:
 Wes Davis, in his quotations of Victorian English attitudes about the Irish (''When English Eyes Are Smiling,'' Op-Ed, March 11), might have added some remarks that the German Friedrich Engels made in his 1844 ''Condition of the English Working Class.''
 Engels wrote that Irish poverty was primarily ''owing to the character of the people, and to their historical development.'' For Engels: ''With the Irish, feeling and passion predominate. Their sensuous, excitable nature prevents reflection and quiet, persevering activity.''
 Of course Engels also described the terrible conditions among the Irish on either island. Still, I could go on quoting him about the ''brutal habits'' of the Irish -- if my excitable nature did not get in the way.Margaret LambNew York, March 12, 2007The writer is an associate professor of English at Fordham University.To the Editor:
 The Irish, Scots and Welsh are suspicious that the pronouncement from the University of Oxford that they are genetically related to the English is a thinly veiled attempt at social climbing by the English.James M. FarrellFlemington, N.J., March 12, 2007To the Editor:
 I suspect that the Oxford University researcher has suddenly discovered that we Irish (Celts) are held in high regard worldwide; that we are economically successful; that we are a happy people; that we were kind and welcoming to their rugby fans when they came to Croke Park, Dublin, even while we walloped their ''unbeatable'' team; that we are quite civilized despite what their historians tell them, so they want to be part of us.

HEADLINE: Protecting Wages in a Global Economy

 BODY:
Federal wage insurance is a pilot program for a small subset of workers, age 50 or older, who lose their jobs to trade competition. Under the program, a worker who takes a lower-paying replacement job can receive a government subsidy for two years, equal to 50 percent of the difference in earnings up to a total of $10,000, provided the new job pays less than $50,000 a year. 
 Congress is now examining whether wage insurance should be expanded to a national program and added to existing aid for the unemployed. There are some attractive aspects to the program. But it should not be the first priority in dealing with job loss. Given the nation's limited budget resources, it would be very difficult to incorporate wage insurance into the social safety net without cannibalizing other programs.
 First, traditional unemployment insurance must be improved before wage insurance is expanded. A joint federal/state program, unemployment insurance is currently available to about 35 percent of workers and replaces, on average, about a third of their weekly earnings, usually for up to 26 weeks. Critics portray it as a license to loaf. But people who collect unemployment insurance generally find better-paying jobs than those who do not and are more likely to find jobs with health insurance. That is a strong argument in favor of expanding unemployment insurance, not curtailing or replacing it. 
 There is also no reason to believe that taxpayer dollars are better spent on wage insurance than on retraining for displaced workers. States and localities have had good results from retraining, which could be bolstered with federal support.
 On the positive side, wage insurance could be a pragmatic response to the downward pressure on wages from globalization. Not everyone who loses a job in today's economy is able to find a comparable new one. Wage insurance would help keep displaced workers working and, possibly, help them to acquire new skills on the job. But there are still many unanswered questions about its efficacy. 
 So far, the issue has divided on predictable lines. House Republicans have introduced a bill that would let states use unemployment insurance funds to pay for wage insurance or other programs, like private employee accounts, that could be tapped in case of job loss. That would be good for free-market cheerleaders, but not for laid-off workers.
 In contrast, a Democratic representative, Jim McDermott of Washington, has drafted two proposals. One, costing roughly $7.5 billion over five years, would expand unemployment insurance, to be paid for by extending an expiring federal unemployment tax on employers, equal to about $14 per worker per year. The other would allocate $3.5 billion a year to establish a national program of wage insurance, to be paid for by a new employer tax equal to about $40 per worker per year. 
 Congress should first proceed with improvements to unemployment compensation and then further explore the merits of direct job retraining and wage insurance. Ideally, the nation would be able to provide unemployment insurance, retraining and wage insurance. But lawmakers have to make tough choices. It's crucial to the economic well being of families that they choose well.

HEADLINE: The Commuting Conundrum

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Reporting was contributed by Ford Fessenden, Kevin Flynn and Vincent M. Mallozzi.

 BODY:
IN many ways, commuter railroads are a victim of their own success. 
 Thanks to high gasoline prices, perpetually clogged highways and a strong economy, the three major commuter rail lines that serve the New York metropolitan area are handling more passengers than ever. Last year, ridership on New Jersey Transit trains jumped 6.8 percent, to 74 million, setting a record for the second consecutive year. Metro-North also hit a record last year, carrying 2.4 million additional riders. And the Long Island Rail Road, which saw a big decline in traffic after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, rose for the second straight year in 2006 after three years of decline.
So, with all the extra revenue these extra passengers bring in, why are the region's commuter rails scrambling to come up with money to meet the increased demand for service? Why is New Jersey Transit looking to increase fares by 9.9 percent this year? And will fares rise on Metro-North and the L.I.R.R. next year? 
 Part of the answer to these questions rests on an overriding truth about mass transit: Revenue from fares typically covers about half a railroad's operating costs, so the more ridership grows, the more money railroads must find from other sources to make ends meet. Yet with state and federal mass transportation budgets stretched thin, railroads are finding it harder to resist raising ticket prices. 
 ''Fare increases are always an option of last resort,'' said George D. Warrington, the departing executive director of New Jersey Transit, who has recommended the increase to cover a projected $60 million shortfall in next year's $1.5 billion operating budget. But he insists the plan ''still makes mass transit a very good bargain in this state.''
 Mr. Warrington may be right. Even if fares rise by as much as proposed, which would be the third increase since 2002, rail passengers on New Jersey Transit would pay 18.3 cents a mile compared with 16.7 cents a mile now. That is less than the 20.3 cents a mile on Metro-North lines and 20.7 cents a mile that L.I.R.R. riders pay.
 But averages are cold comfort to many commuters who shell out hundreds of dollars a month for train passes.
 ''What's worrying me is where does it stop?'' asked Anthony Cariglia, 38, a radio producer who rides on the North Jersey Coast Line into Manhattan from Little Silver. ''I guess I'm going to have to cancel HBO or start drinking cheaper beer.''
 As any commuter who has to stand on the 7:30 a.m. Metro-North train from Stamford, Conn., to Grand Central Terminal will tell you, the price of a ticket is just one way to assess the quality of one's commute. Riders also weigh on-time performance, train frequency and travel time, as well as whether they can get a seat on the train, a parking spot at the station and an easy connection to subways, buses and light rail. The acid test, though, is how transit systems compete with driving. What does it say about the L.I.R.R. if more commuters choose to pay for gasoline, tolls and parking, while navigating jam-packed highways, bridges and tunnels, instead of jostling for a seat on the 8:03 a.m. from Babylon?
 ''Ultimately, you want to get from here to there as quickly as you can,'' said Bruce Schaller, a transportation consultant. ''Money always has some influence, but it's certainly no greater than others. What makes the biggest difference is travel time, reliability and the sense of control and comfort you have, rather than incremental changes in the fares.''
 Still, the proposed fare increase in New Jersey -- and the growing odds that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will raise fares on Metro-North and L.I.R.R. next year -- highlights the trade-offs riders make when weighing whether to take the train or to travel another way.
 The debate over fares, the level of service and financing is not new, of course, but it occurs as ridership at peak hours on New Jersey Transit, Metro-North and the L.I.R.R. is nearing capacity. More money is needed to expand service, but rail advocates question whether raising fares is the best way to bolster the network, let alone alleviate road congestion, reduce carbon emissions and contain sprawl.
 ''It's not outrageous that fares go up, but in a day and age when we're encouraging people to use mass transit, tolls don't go up at the same time,'' said Jeffrey M. Zupan, senior fellow for transportation at the Regional Plan Association. ''Tolls and fares should go up in tandem.''
 Ridership is expected to continue growing, increasing the strain on rail lines and stations. In New Jersey, the number of train riders grew 64 percent from 1997 to 2004, according to the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. Growth in trans-Hudson traffic into Manhattan outpaced similar trips from upstate New York, Connecticut and Long Island.
 The number of commuters crossing the Hudson River to Manhattan is expected to rise 27 percent from 2005 to 2025, according to New Jersey Transit forecasts from 2006. 
 How to balance fares and service is an imprecise political calculation that reflects the priorities of lawmakers who cast votes on the budgets that finance railroads. In New Jersey's case, lawmakers did not raise fares for a dozen years from 1990 to 2002, a big reason riders on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North now pay so much more -- and why New Jersey Transit is playing catch-up.
 To cover the shortfall in operating costs, New Jersey Transit borrowed from its capital budget. The decision was a conciliatory gesture to riders, but it weakened New Jersey Transit's ability to pay for long-term projects like buying new cars and fixing stations. 
 The relatively low fares, as well as the growth in riders in central and northwestern New Jersey who trade longer commutes for bigger homes in more affordable communities, have driven up ridership, straining the system and making it more critical for New Jersey Transit to find fresh funds. But the series of fare increases is leading some New Jersey Transit commuters to question whether riding the rails is still worth it.
 Antoinette Martino, who rides round trip from South Amboy every day with her husband, Frank, said a fare increase was not justified because the service wasn't ''all that reliable.''
 ''I don't necessarily get a seat every day,'' she said, ''and the trains are often overcrowded.''
 The couple, whose passes cost $254 a month each, are now considering driving. (Their passes would be $279 should fares increase as proposed.) ''Even if it's just the two of us driving, it's still cheaper,'' Mrs. Martino said.
 New Jersey Transit has an average fleet age of 13 years, while L.I.R.R. trains have an average age of 9 years. Metro-North trains, at an average age of 16.9 years, are the oldest. That is mainly because Connecticut, which pays for two-thirds of the cost of the trains on the New Haven Line, has been slow to replace its cars. For example, of the New Haven Line's electric fleet, the M2s (241 cars) have an average age of 32 years. By contrast, on Metro-North's Harlem and Hudson Lines, a total of 336 new M7 trains were put into service from 2004 through 2006. 
 Debbie Simmons, an insurance executive from Wethersfield, Conn., who has been riding the New Haven line for 20 years, said she gave Metro-North a grade of B minus for service, explaining that the trains were generally on time, but that they had their share of faults. ''The train itself is uncomfortable,'' she said one recent morning, after getting off the 6:53 from New Haven. ''It's very rickety.''
 Federal, state and local subsidies cover about 55 percent of the operating budgets at New Jersey Transit and at the L.I.R.R. Subsidies cover only 38.6 percent of costs at Metro-North, which also operates the Harlem and Hudson Lines in New York, as well as two lines west of the Hudson. Connecticut's contribution has consequences. According to the Connecticut Metro-North New Haven Rail Commuter Council, a rider advocacy group created by the state legislature, on an average day, 17 percent of the rail cars serving Connecticut are out of service. And 33 refurbished cars that are on the way represent only a 10 percent increase in a fleet that is more than 20 percent underserved. 
 As a result of the shortage of seats, Connecticut riders have a 20 percent chance of standing for part of their commute to New York, according to Metro-North's monthly operating figures. This more than irks Connecticut riders, who pay some of the highest commuter rail fares in the country.
 ''Metro-North gets high grades for being on time, but ridership continues to grow 5 percent a year and we haven't had any new cars delivered in the past five years,'' said Jim Cameron, the chairman of the New Haven rail council. ''You can't expect people to pay more when they are getting poor service.'' 
 Since New York contributes more to its rail lines, fares on Metro-North's Hudson and Harlem Lines, which run just in New York, are slightly less. A one-way ticket during peak hours from Rowayton in Connecticut on the New Haven Line to Grand Central Terminal costs $12.25 and a monthly pass, $264. By contrast, a similar 39-mile, 60-minute ride on the Harlem Line from Bedford Hills in Westchester County to Manhattan sets you back $11.50 for a one-way ticket and $251 for a monthly pass.
 The gap could get even larger because Connecticut riders face a proposal to add a $1 per ride surcharge to help pay for more than 300 new cars, the first of which are expected to arrive in 2009. A monthly pass would most likely have $40 added (for 40 rides, or 20 round trips); for instance, a monthly pass from Stamford to New York City that now costs $264, would increase in price by 15.2 percent. Although the cars have been ordered, Gov. M. Jodi Rell has asked State Senators Andrew McDonald and William H. Nickerson to look at possible alternatives to the surcharge. The surcharge is expected to bring in $150 million, according to the Connecticut Department of Transportation, and would end in 7.5 years.
 Riders from Morristown, by contrast, pay $9.50 for a one-way ticket and $263 for a monthly pass. Commuters to Princeton Junction, which is also about an hour from Manhattan, pay $10.75 one way and $301 for a monthly pass. The difference in price is partly a result of how each line is configured. Some lines, like the Northeast Corridor, run for long distances with fewer stations and higher track speeds. Others, including the Morris & Essex Line, have more stops. So though Morristown is 16 miles closer to New York, it takes just as long to get to Pennsylvania Station.
 A 60-minute ride to Massapequa Park on the L.I.R.R. costs $9.25 for a one-way ticket and $203 for a monthly pass. L.I.R.R. riders, however, have longer average commutes to Manhattan -- 79 minutes -- than commuters on New Jersey Transit and Metro-North east of the Hudson, who travel about 73 minutes. Also, every line on the L.I.R.R., except the Port Washington branch, passes through Jamaica, Queens, and many of these trains require a change there to get to Manhattan.
 ''I've been doing it for 15 years and it never changes,'' said Rhonda Kay, a lawyer who commutes daily on the L.I.R.R. from Huntington to Manhattan. ''The bathrooms are always a disaster. They don't make announcements that explain delays. The double-deckers are like a refrigerator in the summer. On-time performance is pretty good, but when they're late, they're really late.''
 While relatively more expensive per mile than New Jersey Transit, Metro-North has the best on-time performance of the three railroads. On average, 98 percent of its trains arrive within six minutes of its scheduled time. That's three percentage points better than New Jersey Transit and nearly five percentage points more than the L.I.R.R.
 One reason for the difference is that Metro-North is the only railroad at Grand Central Terminal, so managing tunnels and platforms is less complicated. Spare platforms abound, unlike at Penn Station, where Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the L.I.R.R. share 21 platforms, half as many as at Grand Central.
 Complicating matters, the two tunnels crossing the Hudson can handle only 23 trains crossing in each direction each hour. But Amtrak controls the tunnel, and its trains often take priority when there is a scheduling conflict, a problem during rush hour. Discussion is under way about building another Hudson River tunnel. It would cost about $7.5 billion and would not open until 2016 at the earliest. 
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has its own megaprojects, like building a direct link to Grand Central. It has also raised fares on the L.I.R.R. and Metro-North trains east of the Hudson in New York by 6 percent in 2005, 25 percent in 2003 and 9 percent in 1995. Connecticut raised fares by smaller amounts in the intervening years. Railroads, though, often raise fares for monthly passes and single tickets at different rates. One strategy New Jersey Transit took in 2005 was to raise fares faster for single tickets so as not to penalize commuters, the railroad's bread and butter. Metro-North and the L.I.R.R., on the other hand, have maintained a much larger discount for buying single tickets.
 As a rule of thumb, for every 10 percent fare increase, railroads see a temporary 3 percent decline in ridership. After the last fare increase, ridership fell only 2 percent on New Jersey Transit trains. But ridership soon hit yet another record again last year.

HEADLINE: The Commuting Conundrum

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Reporting was contributed by Ford Fessenden, Kevin Flynn and Vincent M. Mallozzi.

 BODY:
IN many ways, commuter railroads are a victim of their own success. 
 Thanks to high gasoline prices, perpetually clogged highways and a strong economy, the three major commuter rail lines that serve the New York metropolitan area are handling more passengers than ever. Last year, ridership on New Jersey Transit trains jumped 6.8 percent, to 74 million, setting a record for the second consecutive year. Metro-North also hit a record last year, carrying 2.4 million additional riders. And the Long Island Rail Road, which saw a big decline in traffic after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, rose for the second straight year in 2006 after three years of decline.
So, with all the extra revenue these extra passengers bring in, why are the region's commuter rails scrambling to come up with money to meet the increased demand for service? Why is New Jersey Transit looking to increase fares by 9.9 percent this year? And will fares rise on Metro-North and the L.I.R.R. next year? 
 Part of the answer to these questions rests on an overriding truth about mass transit: Revenue from fares typically covers about half a railroad's operating costs, so the more ridership grows, the more money railroads must find from other sources to make ends meet. Yet with state and federal mass transportation budgets stretched thin, railroads are finding it harder to resist raising ticket prices. 
 ''Fare increases are always an option of last resort,'' said George D. Warrington, the departing executive director of New Jersey Transit, who has recommended the increase to cover a projected $60 million shortfall in next year's $1.5 billion operating budget. But he insists the plan ''still makes mass transit a very good bargain in this state.''
 Mr. Warrington may be right. Even if fares rise by as much as proposed, which would be the third increase since 2002, rail passengers on New Jersey Transit would pay 18.3 cents a mile compared with 16.7 cents a mile now. That is less than the 20.3 cents a mile on Metro-North lines and 20.7 cents a mile that L.I.R.R. riders pay.
 But averages are cold comfort to many commuters who shell out hundreds of dollars a month for train passes.
 ''What's worrying me is where does it stop?'' asked Anthony Cariglia, 38, a radio producer who rides on the North Jersey Coast Line into Manhattan from Little Silver. ''I guess I'm going to have to cancel HBO or start drinking cheaper beer.''
 As any commuter who has to stand on the 7:30 a.m. Metro-North train from Stamford, Conn., to Grand Central Terminal will tell you, the price of a ticket is just one way to assess the quality of one's commute. Riders also weigh on-time performance, train frequency and travel time, as well as whether they can get a seat on the train, a parking spot at the station and an easy connection to subways, buses and light rail. The acid test, though, is how transit systems compete with driving. What does it say about the L.I.R.R. if more commuters choose to pay for gasoline, tolls and parking, while navigating jam-packed highways, bridges and tunnels, instead of jostling for a seat on the 8:03 a.m. from Babylon?
 ''Ultimately, you want to get from here to there as quickly as you can,'' said Bruce Schaller, a transportation consultant. ''Money always has some influence, but it's certainly no greater than others. What makes the biggest difference is travel time, reliability and the sense of control and comfort you have, rather than incremental changes in the fares.''
 Still, the proposed fare increase in New Jersey -- and the growing odds that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will raise fares on Metro-North and L.I.R.R. next year -- highlights the trade-offs riders make when weighing whether to take the train or to travel another way.
 The debate over fares, the level of service and financing is not new, of course, but it occurs as ridership at peak hours on New Jersey Transit, Metro-North and the L.I.R.R. is nearing capacity. More money is needed to expand service, but rail advocates question whether raising fares is the best way to bolster the network, let alone alleviate road congestion, reduce carbon emissions and contain sprawl.
 ''It's not outrageous that fares go up, but in a day and age when we're encouraging people to use mass transit, tolls don't go up at the same time,'' said Jeffrey M. Zupan, senior fellow for transportation at the Regional Plan Association. ''Tolls and fares should go up in tandem.''
 Ridership is expected to continue growing, increasing the strain on rail lines and stations. In New Jersey, the number of train riders grew 64 percent from 1997 to 2004, according to the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. Growth in trans-Hudson traffic into Manhattan outpaced similar trips from upstate New York, Connecticut and Long Island.
 The number of commuters crossing the Hudson River to Manhattan is expected to rise 27 percent from 2005 to 2025, according to New Jersey Transit forecasts from 2006. 
 How to balance fares and service is an imprecise political calculation that reflects the priorities of lawmakers who cast votes on the budgets that finance railroads. In New Jersey's case, lawmakers did not raise fares for a dozen years from 1990 to 2002, a big reason riders on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North now pay so much more -- and why New Jersey Transit is playing catch-up.
 To cover the shortfall in operating costs, New Jersey Transit borrowed from its capital budget. The decision was a conciliatory gesture to riders, but it weakened New Jersey Transit's ability to pay for long-term projects like buying new cars and fixing stations. 
 The relatively low fares, as well as the growth in riders in central and northwestern New Jersey who trade longer commutes for bigger homes in more affordable communities, have driven up ridership, straining the system and making it more critical for New Jersey Transit to find fresh funds. But the series of fare increases is leading some New Jersey Transit commuters to question whether riding the rails is still worth it.
 Antoinette Martino, who rides round trip from South Amboy every day with her husband, Frank, said a fare increase was not justified because the service wasn't ''all that reliable.''
 ''I don't necessarily get a seat every day,'' she said, ''and the trains are often overcrowded.''
 The couple, whose passes cost $254 a month each, are now considering driving. (Their passes would be $279 should fares increase as proposed.) ''Even if it's just the two of us driving, it's still cheaper,'' Mrs. Martino said.
 New Jersey Transit has an average fleet age of 13 years, while L.I.R.R. trains have an average age of 9 years. Metro-North trains, at an average age of 16.9 years, are the oldest. That is mainly because Connecticut, which pays for two-thirds of the cost of the trains on the New Haven Line, has been slow to replace its cars. For example, of the New Haven Line's electric fleet, the M2s (241 cars) have an average age of 32 years. By contrast, on Metro-North's Harlem and Hudson Lines, a total of 336 new M7 trains were put into service from 2004 through 2006. 
 Debbie Simmons, an insurance executive from Wethersfield, Conn., who has been riding the New Haven line for 20 years, said she gave Metro-North a grade of B minus for service, explaining that the trains were generally on time, but that they had their share of faults. ''The train itself is uncomfortable,'' she said one recent morning, after getting off the 6:53 from New Haven. ''It's very rickety.''
 Federal, state and local subsidies cover about 55 percentof the operating budgets at New Jersey Transit and at the L.I.R.R. Subsidies cover only 38.6 percent of costs at Metro-North, which also operates the Harlem and Hudson Lines in New York, as well as two lines west of the Hudson. Connecticut's contribution has consequences. According to the Connecticut Metro-North New Haven Rail Commuter Council, a rider advocacy group created by the state legislature, on an average day, 17 percent of the rail cars serving Connecticut are out of service. And 33 refurbished cars that are on the way represent only a 10 percent increase in a fleet that is more than 20 percent underserved. 
 As a result of the shortage of seats, Connecticut riders have a 20 percent chance of standing for part of their commute to New York, according to Metro-North's monthly operating figures. This more than irks Connecticut riders, who pay some of the highest commuter rail fares in the country.
 ''Metro-North gets high grades for being on time, but ridership continues to grow 5 percent a year and we haven't had any new cars delivered in the past five years,'' said Jim Cameron, the chairman of the New Haven rail council. ''You can't expect people to pay more when they are getting poor service.'' 
 Since New York contributes more to its rail lines, fares on Metro-North's Hudson and Harlem Lines, which run just in New York, are slightly less. A one-way ticket during peak hours from Rowayton in Connecticut on the New Haven Line to Grand Central Terminal costs $12.25 and a monthly pass, $264. By contrast, a similar 39-mile, 60-minute ride on the Harlem Line from Bedford Hills in Westchester County to Manhattan sets you back $11.50 for a one-way ticket and $251 for a monthly pass.
 The gap could get even larger because Connecticut riders face a proposal to add a $1 per ride surcharge to help pay for more than 300 new cars, the first of which are expected to arrive in 2009. A monthly pass would most likely have $40 added ( for 40 rides, or 20 round trips); for instance, a monthly pass from Stamford to New York City that now costs $264, would increase in price by 15.2 percent. Although the cars have been ordered, Gov. M. Jodi Rell has asked State Senators Andrew McDonald and William H. Nickerson to look at possible alternatives to the surcharge. The surcharge is expected to bring in $150 million, according to the Connecticut Department of Transportation, and would end in 7.5 years.
 Riders from Morristown, N.J., by contrast, pay $9.50 for a one-way ticket and $263 for a monthly pass. Commuters to Princeton Junction, which is also about an hour from Manhattan, pay $10.75 one way and $301 for a monthly pass. The difference in price is partly a result of how each line is configured. Some lines, like the Northeast Corridor, run for long distances with fewer stations and higher track speeds. Others, including the Morris & Essex Line, have more stops. So though Morristown is 16 miles closer to New York, it takes just as long to get to Pennsylvania Station.
 A 60-minute ride to Massapequa Park on the L.I.R.R. costs $9.25 for a one-way ticket and $203 for a monthly pass. L.I.R.R. riders, however, have longer average commutes to Manhattan -- 79 minutes -- than commuters on New Jersey Transit and Metro-North east of the Hudson, who travel about 73 minutes. Also, every line on the L.I.R.R., except the Port Washington branch, passes through Jamaica, Queens, and many of these trains require a change there to get to Manhattan.
 ''I've been doing it for 15 years and it never changes,'' said Rhonda Kay, a lawyer who commutes daily on the L.I.R.R. from Huntington to Manhattan. ''The bathrooms are always a disaster. They don't make announcements that explain delays. The double-deckers are like a refrigerator in the summer. On-time performance is pretty good, but when they're late, they're really late.''
 While relatively more expensive per mile than New Jersey Transit, Metro-North has the best on-time performance of the three railroads. On average, 98 percent of its trains arrive within six minutes of its scheduled time. That's three percentage points better than New Jersey Transit and nearly five percentage points more than the L.I.R.R.

HEADLINE: Zoning Out the Future

BYLINE: By Vince Polimeni. 
Vince Polimeni, a former president of the Association for a Better Long Island, is the head of a development firm.

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY 

 BODY:
THE developer Charles Wang has withdrawn an innovative proposal that would have brought housing, retail, hotel and office space to Plainview. One could have easily found a compromise that would have adjusted the density envisioned by the proposal, but protesters instead quashed it altogether. Sensing no leadership from John Venditto, Oyster Bay supervisor, Mr. Wang withdrew the application and will wind up submitting the ho-hum plan for houses and offices that zoning law will allow. 
 In Great Neck, meanwhile, a developer wants to build luxury apartments, but seeks to set aside some 20 percent of the units for young firefighters who volunteer in the village fire department. If neighborhood criticism hobbles this effort, the developer will build what is allowed under the current zoning or sell his land to a church or synagogue. 
In Syosset, a 10-year dispute between a developer and civic association members is still in court because the Town of Oyster Bay refuses to approve a compromise version of a mall featuring Neiman Marcus. The proposed mall would be put on an industrial site, surrounded by two highway department depots, an animal shelter and the Long Island Expressway. 
 The list of failed or pending development on Long Island goes on. 
 The problem is that across the region, elected officials have willingly abdicated their zoning authority to civic groups that bitterly complain about property taxes while blocking proposals that would actually ease the burden borne by homeowners. 
 Had these reactionary not-in-my-backyard forces been as dominant in the years just after World War II, most Long Islanders would still be living in cramped apartments in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens. 
 Sadly, few municipal leaders today have the political will or the governmental vision to embrace a new generation of progressive development. The obvious solution would be to recast the Long Island Regional Planning Board, which has a minimal role, into an agency that has the authority to supersede zoning laws in local towns and the Island's two cities. Having produced three huge master planning reports in the last 30 years pertaining to Long Island's land use, the board understands, as few others do, the strategic role of ''smart growth'' in creating a vibrant, strong and attractive region. It would take a political earthquake in Albany to give the board such powers, but crushing property taxes, combined with a strong governor, could create the crucible for such change. 
 What is lost in the hostile assault on new ideas is that Long Island is changing regardless of zoning delays. It has become so expensive to live here that the next generation of Long Islanders isn't just leaving, it's fleeing. Why? Because there's no affordable housing. The region continues to be dismissive of efforts to reinvent obsolete property like the old Cerro Wire factory in Syosset and the Kings Park Psychiatric Center in Smithtown.
 But the biggest challenge is now before all of us. What do we do with tired, obsolete properties surrounding the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum? After a spirited competition that included me, Edward Blumenfeld and Jan Burman, Scott Rechler and Mr. Wang were declared the winners. Given the scope of their plan, which includes recreational, retail, office and residential space, they have a long road ahead of them. I hope Mr. Wang's experience in Plainview doesn't make them gun-shy. 
 Hempstead Town officials will find themselves facing the same historic crossroads as their forefathers did in 1947, when Levittown was approved. Can they play the role of visionaries intent on remaking Mitchel Field air base into an accessible, dynamic and economically potent community? Or will they abdicate and allow the future to come to them in whatever form it wishes to take?
 What we need are master builders like Robert Moses, who understood how to dream big and build bigger. If the Town of Hempstead fails to deliver the future, we can only hope that a profound change in how we approve Long Island development proposals is not far behind.

IN many ways, commuter railroads are a victim of their own success. 
 Thanks to high gasoline prices, perpetually clogged highways and a strong economy, the three major commuter rail lines that serve the New York metropolitan area are handling more passengers than ever. Last year, ridership on New Jersey Transit trains jumped 6.8 percent, to 74 million, setting a record for the second consecutive year. Metro-North also hit a record last year, carrying 2.4 million additional riders. And the Long Island Rail Road, which saw a big decline in traffic after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, rose for the second straight year in 2006 after three years of decline.
So, with all the extra revenue these extra passengers bring in, why are the region's commuter rails scrambling to come up with money to meet the increased demand for service? Why is New Jersey Transit looking to increase fares by 9.9 percent this year? And will fares rise on Metro-North and the L.I.R.R. next year? 
 Part of the answer to these questions rests on an overriding truth about mass transit: Revenue from fares typically covers about half a railroad's operating costs, so the more ridership grows, the more money railroads must find from other sources to make ends meet. Yet with state and federal mass transportation budgets stretched thin, railroads are finding it harder to resist raising ticket prices.

But he insists the plan ''still makes mass transit a very good bargain in this state.''
 Mr. Warrington may be right. Even if fares rise by as much as proposed, which would be the third increase since 2002, rail passengers on New Jersey Transit would pay 18.3 cents a mile compared with 16.7 cents a mile now. That is less than the 20.3 cents a mile on Metro-North lines and 20.7 cents a mile that L.I.R.R. riders pay.
 But averages are cold comfort to many commuters who shell out hundreds of dollars a month for train passes.
 ''What's worrying me is where does it stop?'' asked Anthony Cariglia, 38, a radio producer who rides on the North Jersey Coast Line into Manhattan from Little Silver. ''I guess I'm going to have to cancel HBO or start drinking cheaper beer.''
 As any commuter who has to stand on the 7:30 a.m. Metro-North train from Stamford, Conn., to Grand Central Terminal will tell you, the price of a ticket is just one way to assess the quality of one's commute. Riders also weigh on-time performance, train frequency and travel time, as well as whether they can get a seat on the train, a parking spot at the station and an easy connection to subways, buses and light rail. The acid test, though, is how transit systems compete with driving. What does it say about the L.I.R.R. if more commuters choose to pay for gasoline, tolls and parking, while navigating jam-packed highways, bridges and tunnels, instead of jostling for a seat on the 8:03 a.m. from Babylon?
 ''Ultimately, you want to get from here to there as quickly as you can,'' said Bruce Schaller, a transportation consultant. ''Money always has some influence, but it's certainly no greater than others. What makes the biggest difference is travel time, reliability and the sense of control and comfort you have, rather than incremental changes in the fares.''
 Still, the proposed fare increase in New Jersey -- and the growing odds that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will raise fares on Metro-North and L.I.R.R. next year -- highlights the trade-offs riders make when weighing whether to take the train or to travel another way.
 The debate over fares, the level of service and financing is not new, of course, but it occurs as ridership at peak hours on New Jersey Transit, Metro-North and the L.I.R.R. is nearing capacity. More money is needed to expand service, but rail advocates question whether raising fares is the best way to bolster the network, let alone alleviate road congestion, reduce carbon emissions and contain sprawl.
 ''It's not outrageous that fares go up, but in a day and age when we're encouraging people to use mass transit, tolls don't go up at the same time,'' said Jeffrey M. Zupan, senior fellow for transportation at the Regional Plan Association. ''Tolls and fares should go up in tandem.''
 Ridership is expected to continue growing, increasing the strain on rail lines and stations. In New Jersey, the number of train riders grew 64 percent from 1997 to 2004, according to the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. Growth in trans-Hudson traffic into Manhattan outpaced similar trips from upstate New York, Connecticut and Long Island.
 The number of commuters crossing the Hudson River to Manhattan is expected to rise 27 percent from 2005 to 2025, according to New Jersey Transit forecasts from 2006. 
 How to balance fares and service is an imprecise political calculation that reflects the priorities of lawmakers who cast votes on the budgets that finance railroads. In New Jersey's case, lawmakers did not raise fares for a dozen years from 1990 to 2002, a big reason riders on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North now pay so much more -- and why New Jersey Transit is playing catch-up.
 To cover the shortfall in operating costs, New Jersey Transit borrowed from its capital budget. The decision was a conciliatory gesture to riders, but it weakened New Jersey Transit's ability to pay for long-term projects like buying new cars and fixing stations. 
 The relatively low fares, as well as the growth in riders in central and northwestern New Jersey who trade longer commutes for bigger homes in more affordable communities, have driven up ridership, straining the system and making it more critical for New Jersey Transit to find fresh funds. But the series of fare increases is leading some New Jersey Transit commuters to question whether riding the rails is still worth it.
 Antoinette Martino, who rides round trip from South Amboy every day with her husband, Frank, said a fare increase was not justified because the service wasn't ''all that reliable.''
 ''I don't necessarily get a seat every day,'' she said, ''and the trains are often overcrowded.''
 The couple, whose passes cost $254 a month each, are now considering driving. (Their passes would be $279 should fares increase as proposed.) ''Even if it's just the two of us driving, it's still cheaper,'' Mrs. Martino said.
 New Jersey Transit has an average fleet age of 13 years, while L.I.R.R. trains have an average age of 9 years. Metro-North trains, at an average age of 16.9 years, are the oldest. That is mainly because Connecticut, which pays for two-thirds of the cost of the trains on the New Haven Line, has been slow to replace its cars. For example, of the New Haven Line's electric fleet, the M2s (241 cars) have an average age of 32 years. By contrast, on Metro-North's Harlem and Hudson Lines, a total of 336 new M7 trains were put into service from 2004 through 2006. 
 Debbie Simmons, an insurance executive from Wethersfield, Conn., who has been riding the New Haven line for 20 years, said she gave Metro-North a grade of B minus for service, explaining that the trains were generally on time, but that they had their share of faults. ''The train itself is uncomfortable,'' she said one recent morning, after getting off the 6:53 from New Haven. ''It's very rickety.''
 Federal, state and local subsidies cover about 55 percent of the operating budgets at New Jersey Transit and at the L.I.R.R. Subsidies cover only 38.6 percent of costs at Metro-North, which also operates the Harlem and Hudson Lines in New York, as well as two lines west of the Hudson. Connecticut's contribution has consequences. According to the Connecticut Metro-North New Haven Rail Commuter Council, a rider advocacy group created by the state legislature, on an average day, 17 percent of the rail cars serving Connecticut are out of service. And 33 refurbished cars that are on the way represent only a 10 percent increase in a fleet that is more than 20 percent underserved. 
 As a result of the shortage of seats, Connecticut riders have a 20 percent chance of standing for part of their commute to New York, according to Metro-North's monthly operating figures. This more than irks Connecticut riders, who pay some of the highest commuter rail fares in the country.
 ''Metro-North gets high grades for being on time, but ridership continues to grow 5 percent a year and we haven't had any new cars delivered in the past five years,'' said Jim Cameron, the chairman of the New Haven rail council. ''You can't expect people to pay more when they are getting poor service.'' 
 Since New York contributes more to its rail lines, fares on Metro-North's Hudson and Harlem Lines, which run just in New York, are slightly less. A one-way ticket during peak hours from Rowayton in Connecticut on the New Haven Line to Grand Central Terminal costs $12.25 and a monthly pass, $264. By contrast, a similar 39-mile, 60-minute ride on the Harlem Line from Bedford Hills in Westchester County to Manhattan sets you back $11.50 for a one-way ticket and $251 for a monthly pass.
 The gap could get even larger because Connecticut riders face a proposal to add a $1 per ride surcharge to help pay for more than 300 new cars, the first of which are expected to arrive in 2009. A monthly pass would most likely have $40 added ( for 40 rides, or 20 round trips); for instance, a monthly pass from Stamford to New York City that now costs $264, would increase in price by 15.2 percent. Although the cars have been ordered, Gov. M. Jodi Rell has asked State Senators Andrew McDonald and William H. Nickerson to look at possible alternatives to the surcharge. The surcharge is expected to bring in $150 million, according to the Connecticut Department of Transportation, and would end in 7.5 years.
 Riders from Morristown, N.J., by contrast, pay $9.50 for a one-way ticket and $263 for a monthly pass. Commuters to Princeton Junction, which is also about an hour from Manhattan, pay $10.75 one way and $301 for a monthly pass. The difference in price is partly a result of how each line is configured. Some lines, like the Northeast Corridor, run for long distances with fewer stations and higher track speeds. Others, including the Morris & Essex Line, have more stops. So though Morristown is 16 miles closer to New York, it takes just as long to get to Pennsylvania Station.
 A 60-minute ride to Massapequa Park on the L.I.R.R. costs $9.25 for a one-way ticket and $203 for a monthly pass. L.I.R.R. riders, however, have longer average commutes to Manhattan -- 79 minutes -- than commuters on New Jersey Transit and Metro-North east of the Hudson, who travel about 73 minutes. Also, every line on the L.I.R.R., except the Port Washington branch, passes through Jamaica, Queens, and many of these trains require a change there to get to Manhattan.
 ''I've been doing it for 15 years and it never changes,'' said Rhonda Kay, a lawyer who commutes daily on the L.I.R.R. from Huntington to Manhattan. ''The bathrooms are always a disaster. They don't make announcements that explain delays. The double-deckers are like a refrigerator in the summer. On-time performance is pretty good, but when they're late, they're really late.''
 While relatively more expensive per mile than New Jersey Transit, Metro-North has the best on-time performance of the three railroads. On average, 98 percent of its trains arrive within six minutes of its scheduled time. That's three percentage points better than New Jersey Transit and nearly five percentage points more than the L.I.R.R.
 One reason for the difference is that Metro-North is the only railroad at Grand Central Terminal, so managing tunnels and platforms is less complicated. Spare platforms abound, unlike at Penn Station, where Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the L.I.R.R. share 21 platforms, half as many as at Grand Central.
 Complicating matters, the two tunnels crossing the Hudson can handle only 23 trains crossing in each direction each hour. But Amtrak controls the tunnel, and its trains often take priority when there is a scheduling conflict, a problem during rush hour. Discussion is under way about building another Hudson River tunnel. It would cost about $7.5 billion and would not open until 2016 at the earliest. 
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has its own megaprojects, like building a direct link to Grand Central. It has also raised fares on the L.I.R.R. and Metro-North trains east of the Hudson in New York by 6 percent in 2005, 25 percent in 2003 and 9 percent in 1995. Connecticut raised fares by smaller amounts in the intervening years. Railroads, though, often raise fares for monthly passes and single tickets at different rates. One strategy the New Jersey Transit took in 2005 was to raise fares faster for single tickets so as not to penalize commuters, the railroad's bread and butter. Metro-North and the L.I.R.R., on the other hand, have maintained a much larger discount for buying single tickets.
 As a rule of thumb, for every 10 percent fare increase, railroads see a temporary 3 percent decline in ridership. After the last fare increase, ridership fell only 2 percent on New Jersey Transit trains. But ridership soon hit yet another record again last year.

HEADLINE: A $10 Million Grant for Homes for the Homeless

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
A $10.1 million federal grant will be used to help homeless Long Islanders find permanent homes.
 Earlier this month, the Nassau-Suffolk Coalition for the Homeless announced the grant from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, which will provide money for 30 Long Island nonprofit agencies -- 15 in Nassau County and 15 in Suffolk -- to create and maintain housing for homeless people with disabilities. They include people with physical disabilities and mental illness, as well as substance abusers and victims of domestic violence.
Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive, said the majority of homeless people on Long Island are single mothers living with their children in temporary shelters. 
 ''We must dispel the misconception that homeless people are all living out on the streets,'' Mr. Levy said. ''Most have lost their permanent homes and are now in a transient phase. The grant money will allow our local agencies to help provide housing and other services like health care, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment and child care.''
 Joan Noguera, the executive director of the Nassau-Suffolk Coalition for the Homeless, said that the largest award, more than $1.2 million, would be given in two grants to Circulo de la Hispanidad, in Nassau County. 
 It will be used for two projects: buying permanent housing for nine homeless victims of domestic violence and purchasing a large house for eight mentally ill men who are homeless. 
 After the announcement of the grant on March 2, Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, appointed a 30-member committee to develop a 10-year plan to deal with chronic homelessness.
 The grant was announced two days after the federal government released a report saying that in 2005, there were about 4,000 homeless people on Long Island. In January, the Nassau-Suffolk Coalition for the Homeless took a newer count, but it has not yet released the numbers. 
 ''The two results can't be compared, because there was a change in criteria and the data was collected differently,'' Ms. Noguera said. ''The new numbers don't include people who are doubling or tripling up in one house, so this count only shows a piece of the whole picture.''$1 Billion Family Resort Proposed for Grumman Site
 The latest proposal for development on a 755-acre site in Riverhead formerly used by Grumman Aerospace calls for a mixed-use family entertainment resort, with a price tag of $1 billion.
 Earlier this month, RexCorp Realty and the Long Island Destination Group, along with the Spector Group as the master planner and architect, submitted a proposal to develop the property, which was formerly used by Grumman for flight testing. 
 The plan for the resort -- called the Epcal Center, for Enterprise Park at Calverton -- includes two hotel-convention centers, with a total of 650 rooms; a 150,000-square-foot conference center; a 100-unit luxury condominium complex; and a marketplace with retail stores and restaurants, as well as an outdoor water park, an amusement area, a family amphitheater and a children's indoor play area. 
 If approved, there would also be an equestrian center, athletic fields and an automobile racetrack.
 Marc Spector, a partner in the Spector Group, projected benefits for the town and all of Suffolk County. ''The town is looking to see this property developed, and this project will be an economic driver that makes so much sense,'' he said.
 The site has been unused since 1994, when Northrop acquired Grumman and announced that it was leaving Calverton. In 1998, the Navy transferred the land to the town, and since then a number of ambitious proposals have come and gone. Among the plans have been a water skiing park, a Nascar racetrack, an Olympic training center and a 464-home golf course community. 
 In 1999, the town created a Recreational Park District Code to focus development on recreational and industrial uses, including amusement parks and sports facilities.
 Philip J. Cardinale, the town supervisor, said that Riverhead was now looking for development that would be consistent with the vision of the updated code and that there were three major areas of concern: traffic, noise and zoning requirements.
 ''The new proposal is an ambitious and aggressive use of the land with diversity and intensity,'' he said. ''But we now have to take a look at it in terms of its impact on the community.''Woman Is Named to Head Suffolk's Homicide Bureau
 For the first time, a woman will head Suffolk County's homicide bureau. District Attorney Thomas J. Spota chose a veteran prosecutor, Janet Albertson, to head the bureau, which investigates and prosecutes homicide cases. Her assignment became official on Monday, at a salary of $135,642.
 Ms. Albertson, 44, is best known for winning a conviction as prosecutor in the 2004 trial of Daniel Pelosi, who was charged with fatally beating R. Theodore Ammon, an East Hampton millionaire. He was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 
 ''She has a stellar record as a prosecutor,'' Mr. Spota said, citing the Pelosi trial in particular. He said that ''with her experience in trying and resolving difficult homicide cases, I know she will succeed in this position.'' 
 Ms. Albertson was first employed in the district attorney's office in 1987 and joined the county's homicide bureau in 1994. She was promoted to deputy chief of the bureau in 2002, the first appointment by Mr. Spota after he became district attorney.

HEADLINE: The Commuting Conundrum

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Reporting was contributed by Ford Fessenden, Kevin Flynn and Vincent M. Mallozzi.

 BODY:
IN many ways, commuter railroads are a victim of their own success. 
 Thanks to high gasoline prices, perpetually clogged highways and a strong economy, the three major commuter rail lines that serve the New York metropolitan area are handling more passengers than ever. Last year, ridership on New Jersey Transit trains jumped 6.8 percent, to 74 million, setting a record for the second consecutive year. Metro-North also hit a record last year, carrying 2.4 million additional riders. And the Long Island Rail Road, which saw a big decline in traffic after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, rose for the second straight year in 2006 after three years of decline.
So, with all the extra revenue these extra passengers bring in, why are the region's commuter rails scrambling to come up with money to meet the increased demand for service? Why is New Jersey Transit looking to increase fares by 9.9 percent this year? And will fares rise on Metro-North and the L.I.R.R. next year? 
 Part of the answer to these questions rests on an overriding truth about mass transit: Revenue from fares typically covers about half a railroad's operating costs, so the more ridership grows, the more money railroads must find from other sources to make ends meet. Yet with state and federal mass transportation budgets stretched thin, railroads are finding it harder to resist raising ticket prices. 
 ''Fare increases are always an option of last resort,'' said George D. Warrington, the departing executive director of New Jersey Transit, who has recommended the increase to cover a projected $60 million shortfall in next year's $1.5 billion operating budget. But he insists the plan ''still makes mass transit a very good bargain in this state.''
 Mr. Warrington may be right. Even if fares rise by as much as proposed, which would be the third increase since 2002, rail passengers on New Jersey Transit would pay 18.3 cents a mile compared with 16.7 cents a mile now. That is less than the 20.3 cents a mile on Metro-North lines and 20.7 cents a mile that L.I.R.R. riders pay.
 But averages are cold comfort to many commuters who shell out hundreds of dollars a month for train passes.
 ''What's worrying me is where does it stop?'' asked Anthony Cariglia, 38, a radio producer who rides on the North Jersey Coast Line into Manhattan from Little Silver. ''I guess I'm going to have to cancel HBO or start drinking cheaper beer.''
 As any commuter who has to stand on the 7:30 a.m. Metro-North train from Stamford to Grand Central Terminal will tell you, the price of a ticket is just one way to assess the quality of one's commute. Riders also weigh on-time performance, train frequency and travel time, as well as whether they can get a seat on the train, a parking spot at the station and an easy connection to subways, buses and light rail. The acid test, though, is how transit systems compete with driving. What does it say about the L.I.R.R. if more commuters choose to pay for gasoline, tolls and parking, while navigating jam-packed highways, bridges and tunnels, instead of jostling for a seat on the 8:03 a.m. from Babylon?

 Still, the proposed fare increase in New Jersey -- and the growing odds that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will raise fares on Metro-North and L.I.R.R. next year -- highlights the trade-offs riders make when weighing whether to take the train or to travel another way.

 Riders from Morristown, N.J., by contrast, pay $9.50 for a one-way ticket and $263 for a monthly pass. Commuters to Princeton Junction, which is also about an hour from Manhattan, pay $10.75 one way and $301 for a monthly pass. The difference in price is partly a result of how each line is configured. Some lines, like the Northeast Corridor, run for long distances with fewer stations and higher track speeds. Others, including the Morris & Essex Line, have more stops. So though Morristown is 16 miles closer to New York, it takes just as long to get to Pennsylvania Station.
 A 60-minute ride to Massapequa Park on the L.I.R.R. costs $9.25 for a one-way ticket and $203 for a monthly pass. L.I.R.R. riders, however, have longer average commutes to Manhattan -- 79 minutes -- than commuters on New Jersey Transit and Metro-North east of the Hudson, who travel about 73 minutes. Also, every line on the L.I.R.R., except the Port Washington branch, passes through Jamaica, Queens, and many of these trains require a change there to get to Manhattan.
 ''I've been doing it for 15 years and it never changes,'' said Rhonda Kay, a lawyer who commutes daily on the L.I.R.R. from Huntington to Manhattan. ''The bathrooms are always a disaster. They don't make announcements that explain delays. The double-deckers are like a refrigerator in the summer. On-time performance is pretty good, but when they're late, they're really late.''
 While relatively more expensive per mile than New Jersey Transit, Metro-North has the best on-time performance of the three railroads. On average, 98 percent of its trains arrive within six minutes of its scheduled time. That's three percentage points better than New Jersey Transit and nearly five percentage points more than the L.I.R.R.
 One reason for the difference is that Metro-North is the only railroad at Grand Central Terminal, so managing tunnels and platforms is less complicated. Spare platforms abound, unlike at Penn Station, where Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the L.I.R.R. share 21 platforms, half as many as at Grand Central.
 Complicating matters, the two tunnels crossing the Hudson can handle only 23 trains crossing in each direction each hour. But Amtrak controls the tunnel, and its trains often take priority when there is a scheduling conflict, a problem during rush hour. Discussion is under way about building another Hudson River tunnel. It would cost about $7.5 billion and would not open until 2016 at the earliest. 
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has its own megaprojects, like building a direct link to Grand Central. It has also raised fares on the L.I.R.R. and Metro-North trains east of the Hudson in New York by 6 percent in 2005, 25 percent in 2003 and 9 percent in 1995. Connecticut raised fares by smaller amounts in the intervening years. Railroads, though, often raise fares for monthly passes and single tickets at different rates. One strategy the New Jersey Transit took in 2005 was to raise fares faster for single tickets so as not to penalize commuters, the railroad's bread and butter. Metro-North and the L.I.R.R., on the other hand, have maintained a much larger discount for buying single tickets.
 As a rule of thumb, for every 10 percent fare increase, railroads see a temporary 3 percent decline in ridership. After the last fare increase, ridership fell only 2 percent on New Jersey Transit trains. But ridership soon hit yet another record again last year.

HEADLINE: Officers Charged in Shooting Face Problems Beyond Court

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
It is up to the courts now to decide the fate of the three city detectives who were indicted in the death of an unarmed black man in Queens. 
 But another complicated question, one that is unlikely to be fully answered for months, is what the Police Department will do with them, as well with the two other officers who were involved in the fatal shooting but not criminally charged.
On Friday, according to union officials and defense lawyers, a grand jury voted to criminally charge detectives Gescard F. Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper in the shooting of Sean Bell, who died in a storm of 50 police bullets hours before his wedding in November. The indictment will be unsealed tomorrow. Detectives Isnora and Oliver were charged with manslaughter, people with knowledge of the decision said, and Detective Cooper was charged with reckless endangerment. 
 After the shooting, which strained relations between the department and minority communities, all five officers were put on paid leave and had their guns taken away. To defuse critics who demanded that the officers be fired, the department commissioned the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit organization, to independently review its gun training and firearm use. 
 Police officials have refused to immediately disclose what action they will take with the officers. But, in the short term, department stipulations are clear. Because they are criminally charged, the detectives face 30-day suspensions without pay and must surrender their badges. Then they will be put on paid desk jobs, pending the outcome of the trial. 
 After that, the department has a range of options: some mandated by police guidelines and state laws; others that will be shaped by what the department's own investigations yield, as well as by how the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, decides to proceed.
 If the detectives are found guilty of felonies, state law requires that they immediately be fired. 
 But even if the detectives are acquitted, it seems unlikely that their careers will ever be the same, if earlier cases provide any guide. The officers could lose vacation days, be reassigned to endless desk jobs without their guns, or be even fired. 
 ''There's a very significant range of formal and informal sanctions,'' said Eugene O'Donnell, a professor of police studies at John Jay School of Criminal Justice. ''At the top end, there's criminal conviction with incarceration, which is unlikely,'' he said, explaining that prosecutors often have trouble proving criminal intent when the police shoot someone.
 ''Equally unlikely is that they'll ever be back in front-line enforcement,'' he added.
 Take the case of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed West African immigrant killed by 19 of the 41 bullets fired at him by four officers in 1999. All four officers were indicted but later acquitted. After an internal investigation, the police commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, decided not to take disciplinary action against the officers. Still, none were given back their guns. 
 Two officers left for the Fire Department, a third retired, and the fourth, Kenneth Boss, recently sued in an effort to be moved from a desk job back to active duty. 
 If acquitted, the three detectives indicted in the Bell shooting could still lose their jobs if police officials determine that the shooting violated the department's guidelines. In 1996, Officer Francis X. Livoti was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide in the 1994 death of Anthony Baez. The police commissioner, Howard Safir, decided to fire Officer Livoti nonetheless, after it was determined at a departmental hearing that he used an illegal choke to subdue Mr. Baez. (Mr. Livoti was later sentenced by a federal court to seven-and-a-half years in prison for violating Mr. Baez's civil rights).
 ''If you're not found guilty, the department can still internally prosecute them,'' said Rae Koshetz, former deputy police commissioner for trials, and now a lawyer who represents Mr. Boss. ''The standard of proof is different; it's easier to find wrongdoing. So yeah, they can be fired.''
 And the two officers who fired at Mr. Bell's car but were not indicted, Officer Michael Carey and Detective Paul Headley, are not immune from disciplinary action, experts said. 
 ''Even if the grand jury decides not to indict, that does not mean that it was an appropriate use of deadly force,'' said Joel Berger, who monitored matters of police conduct as an executive in the city's Law Department from 1988 to 1996.
 Still, the exact fate awaiting any of the officers is impossible to predict. The department's own investigation of the shooting is not likely to conclude until after the detectives' criminal trial ends.

HEADLINE: A Rookie With Ice In His Bloodlines

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN and KARL-ERIC REIF

 BODY:
It can be hard for players who enter the N.H.L. with the burden of having to live up to a father's superstar legacy, and few rise above journeyman status. But suddenly Paul Stastny seems to have a good shot at it -- and as a result he has made the race for rookie of the year very interesting. 
 Riding an 18-game point-scoring streak -- the longest by a rookie in N.H.L. history -- Stastny, a husky 21-year-old center for the Colorado Avalanche, has rocketed into contention for the Calder Trophy.
Stastny is a former University of Denver star whose father, Peter, a Hall of Famer, and uncles Anton and Marian starred for the Avalanche's predecessor, the Quebec Nordiques. Paul had 23 goals and 44 assists for 67 points in 70 games through Friday, along with 38 minutes in penalties. During his streak, Stastny broke team records previously held by Marian and by his father -- whose No. 26, which had been retired, Paul now wears. 
 Stastny is second in rookie scoring and leads all first-year players in assists. His plus/minus differential has risen to plus-5 from minus-5 during the streak. 
 Until Stastny's streak, Evgeni Malkin, the Pittsburgh forward from Russia, dominated Calder talk. Malkin, 20, made a splash by scoring a goal in each of his first six games this season, becoming the only player to do so since Joe Malone in 1917-18. 
 Malkin continues to lead the rookie scoring race with 31-45 -- 76 points in 67 games. The lanky Malkin, flashy and creative, has also won a reputation for carrying his elbows high and has 66 penalty minutes to show for it.
 There is a third, less-heralded, youngster who warrants Calder consideration. Jordan Staal, yet another remarkable presence among Pittsburgh's kiddie corps of burgeoning talent, had a relatively modest 38 points in 69 games through Friday. But 28 of those were goals -- third on the team behind Malkin and Sidney Crosby, and trailing only Malkin among rookies.
 Staal's statistics reveal an unusual degree of sophistication in his play. A 6-foot-4, 220-pound native of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Staal leads the N.H.L. with seven short-handed goals. He also leads his team by a healthy margin with a plus-16 mark, and has been penalized for only 22 minutes. 
 Staal turned 18 shortly before the season began. Saving the Penguins
 Gary Bettman has been the object of relentless scorn from commentators and fans during much of his 14-year tenure as N.H.L. commissioner. But last week he received praise after helping to mediate the agreement that kept the Penguins in Pittsburgh.
 ''Thank you, Gary Bettman!!'' was the title of the lead item in one Pittsburgh fan blog, reflecting the general mood toward him in the city. In the first few years of his tenure, Bettman presided over several franchise shifts from traditional hockey cities to more southerly locales with notably less association with the game, as clubs in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hartford moved to Dallas, Denver, Phoenix and North Carolina. Bettman was widely perceived to have done little to prevent these moves, and the criticism was withering.
 But since the last move, when the Hartford Whalers became the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997, Bettman's public stance on franchise shifts has been very much in opposition. 
 When the Sabres and the Senators went into bankruptcy in the 2002-3 season and there was speculation about moving the teams, Bettman asked that the focus be on ''the need to have a new economic system in order to make sure that all franchises are healthy and competitive where they are currently located.'' 
 Throughout the three-year wrangle over a possible move by the Penguins, Bettman always spoke in favor of the club staying put. In December, the Canadian businessman Jim Balsillie was ready to buy the team, but he dropped out after the league insisted on assurances that he would not move the Penguins. 
 ''Everybody believed the Penguins belonged here in Pittsburgh,'' Bettman said after the agreement was reached Tuesday between the team owners, Mario Lemieux and Ron Burkle, and state, county and city officials. ''There are fans here that care passionately about this team.''
 Indeed, few American cities can claim as deep a connection to hockey. Pittsburgh was a founding member of the world's first professional league, the International Pro League, in 1904. 
 The Pittsburgh Yellowjackets were a top amateur club after World War I, winners of the national championship and suppliers of talent to the United States Olympic team.
 The core of the Yellowjackets' roster turned pro when Pittsburgh was granted an N.H.L. expansion franchise in 1925. The team lasted until the Depression forced it out of town. In 1936, the Pittsburgh Hornets arrived, an American Hockey League mainstay for decades.
 The Penguins were formed in 1967. Much of their existence has been financially precarious. But last week's agreement, brokered in part by Bettman, should keep them in Pittsburgh for many years to come.Union Silent on Hits
 With the N.H.L. Players' Association in disarray over police and internal investigations into possible illegal access to members' private e-mail and potential irregularities in the hiring of its executive director (Ted Saskin, who was put on paid leave last week), there is little chance the union will soon act on the health issues that have arisen in recent weeks.
 Those issues involve the head injuries sustained by various players, all caused by late checks or stickwork. Some of the hits were punished by the league as illegal; some were deemed legal. In all cases, the union was silent about the well-being of its constituents.
 Despite a number of injuries in the past few years as a result of illegal or malicious play by fellow union members, the union's only action -- in marked contrast to similar bodies in soccer and football -- has been to represent the assailants at disciplinary hearings. 
 ''The N.H.L.P.A. will be reviewing and checking hits to the head with our membership at our annual player meetings this summer,'' the union's director of hockey affairs, Mike Gartner, said Friday in an e-mail message. ''The issue of head shots will likely be an item of discussion for the competition committee as well,'' he added, referring to a league committee.Notes
 The Swiss club EV Zug won Game 7 of its quarterfinal against the Rapperswil-Jona Lakers last weekend to cap a comeback from a 0-3 series deficit. Zug became only the fourth team in the history of top-flight pro hockey to win a seven-game series after falling behind by three games. The others were the 1942 Maple Leafs, who rallied to defeat Detroit; the 1975 Islanders, who defeated Pittsburgh; and, last year, the Swiss club HC Lugano, which defeated Ambri-Piotta.
 Paul Gardner, a high-scoring N.H.L. and A.H.L. forward of the 1970 and '80s with no previous head-coaching experience, is making a splash as the Superliga's first American coach. He took over struggling Lokomotiv Yaroslavl in mid-January, promptly led it to nine consecutive victories and wound up capturing 37 of a potential 48 points. On Wednesday, Lokomotiv completed a first-round sweep of Dinamo Moscow. Gardner, a native of Fort Erie, Ontario, and an American citizen, started the season as an assistant at Nashville.

HEADLINE: In Quiet West Texas, Residents Fight an Anticipated Trade Corridor and Its Truck Traffic

BYLINE: By BARBARA NOVOVITCH

DATELINE: MARATHON, Tex., March 17 

 BODY:
The idea that in a few years hundreds of diesel-puffing semi trucks from Mexico could be tooling through two small towns in this area of West Texas every day has upset residents.
 The towns are on the route of a projected trade corridor from Mexico called La Entrada al Pacifico. In the proposal's present form, La Entrada would route semis through single-stoplight Marfa, population 2,400, and neighboring Alpine, population 7,000, which has three traffic signals on two one-way streets through town.
At a Texas Department of Transportation hearing here this week, dozens of residents spoke out against the plan, which state officials insisted was strictly preliminary. 
 ''We own a precious natural resource that is becoming more and more valuable: peace and quiet,'' said Don Dowdey, chairman of the Big Bend Regional Sierra Club. ''Out here, scenery, tranquillity and a rural way of life have attracted people seeking relief from congested cities.'' 
 The Entrada proposal, he said, ''would ruin the heritage of the Big Bend area's beautiful, wide-open spaces.''
 ''Although we are few in number, we will fight to save this resource,'' he said. Interrupted by loud applause, he then predicted, ''And we will be joined by Texans from all over the state who value our unique area.''
 Some here, however, doubt that the proposal can be stopped.
 ''How we behave in the next year could have an impact,'' Mayor Dave Lanman of Marfa said Wednesday, ''but I don't think we're going to stop the corridor. 
 ''They have the ability to chip away at it -- a little piece here, a little piece there -- and they think as the traffic increases the public will get used to it,'' Mr. Lanman added. ''They won't remember when you'd pass just two or three cars for the 24 miles between Marfa and Alpine.''
 Mr. Lanman said he believed that the current highway construction intended to create more passing lanes between Marfa and Alpine was the start of La Entrada, and he fears that the public hearings, which continue Monday in Midland and Tuesday in Fort Stockton, are simply being held to fulfill a legal requirement. 
 Brian Swindell of HDR Engineering in Dallas, which is conducting a study of the plan for the state, said, ''We expect to identify the preferred alternative -- it could be rail or roadway -- and the supporting information that supports selection of that corridor.'' He said bypass routes or a ''do-nothing alternative'' could also be considered. 
 La Entrada al Pacifico was signed into law in 1997 by George W. Bush when he was governor. The oil cities of Midland and Odessa to the north, through the Midland-Odessa Transportation Alliance, have budgeted over $34 million in state and federal transportation money to promote the route, saying the increase in freight traffic will boost local economies. 
 By 2010, according to figures cited at a recent alliance conference, 550 trucks are expected to pass daily through Presidio; by 2020, 1,455 trucks. The current average is 49 per day. 
 Residents of Marfa and Alpine fear that the truck traffic will harm their towns economically because they thrive on tourism. 
 The Alpine City Council has passed a resolution urging the Texas Department of Transportation to explore an alternative solution of restoring an old rail line that runs 362 miles from San Angelo through Fort Stockton and Alpine to Presidio. The line would need improvements estimated at as much as $104 million. Bob Schwab, a Marfa resident, said a rail alternative would also be better for national security because trains are subject to stronger controls.

HEADLINE: At Housing Project, Both Fear and Renewal

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 17 

 BODY:
On a night of freezing temperatures, a bare-chested baby crawled alone along an open ninth-floor gallery at the Cabrini Green housing project, its wails piercing through a nearby apartment's living room walls.
 ''Whose child is this?'' Mattie Gibson shouted, darting from the apartment and peering into vacant units. ''Hello? There's a baby here!''
From a corner apartment, two little boys from a family of squatters emerged to take the child from Ms. Gibson's arms. 
 ''This is the kind of chaos all around here,'' said Ms. Gibson, a payroll clerk who has lived here for 15 years. ''No one seems to be listening. It's like they all moved on.'' 
 For the most part, they have.
 More than a decade ago, when the Chicago Housing Authority began dismantling much of its notoriously dysfunctional stock, the worst of Cabrini Green was the first to meet the wrecking ball because it was considered to be among the most frightful addresses in the country. 
 For some families, it still is. Under the supervision of a federal judge, the demolitions have slowed while the residents of several deteriorating buildings and the Housing Authority negotiate redevelopment plans and where the displaced population will go.
 In one 19-acre part of the project officially known as the William Green Homes, there were once more than 1,000 apartments in eight 15-story towers. Today, 176 families and an unknown number of squatters live there in three remaining buildings. At its peak, the entire Cabrini project was home to about 15,000 people in hundreds of row houses and towers. Many of those structures are long gone, or are awaiting rehabilitation or demolition. 
 The project was popularized by the 1970s sitcom ''Good Times'' as a neighborhood of strivers and funnymen, but reality was more cruel: Cabrini Green was the kind of place where a young boy could be killed by sniper fire while holding his mother's hand on the way to school, as happened in the fall of 1992. 
 Now the neighborhood, near the intersection of Halsted and Division Streets on the North Side near downtown, is rapidly gentrifying with new condominiums and shopping strips, amenities that were unthinkable just a decade ago.
 Though life in the project remains hellish -- a woman recently fatally overdosed in the stairwell near Ms. Gibson's door, and drug dealers sometimes take control of the building entrances -- there is a feeling that the worst of the bad old days are over for the neighborhood at large. From the gallery outside her apartment, Ms. Gibson can see the gleaming lights of two new Starbucks, a Blockbuster and the shopping carts from a stylish grocery store.
 Because of the changes, many public housing residents have refused to leave the area, where roots run generations deep. In 2004, the Local Advisory Council, which represents hundreds of residents, sued the Housing Authority over relocation plans from the city's Plan for Transformation, a $1.4 billion blueprint for public housing renewal adopted in 2000.
 Richard Wheelock, a lawyer for the Legal Assistance Foundation of Metropolitan Chicago, which represents the tenants, said the Housing Authority's demolition program had far outpaced its construction, leaving families with few options beyond ''equally dangerous and segregated communities'' on the city's West and South Sides. ''The only leverage the residents have is to say we're going to stay here until you build the stuff,'' he said.
 Mr. Wheelock also said that tens of thousands of displaced residents who meet certain standards have received federal housing vouchers, which allow them to move wherever they find a willing landlord. 
 About two-thirds of the displaced families with vouchers have indicated that they would prefer to return to traditional public housing, officials said. But the Plan for Transformation, a national model in its scope and original ambition, is off schedule and in need of more money. The goals were to demolish obsolete buildings and to break up pockets of poverty by incorporating public housing into mixed-income communities. 
 Seven years into it, slightly less than 30 percent of the new housing for those residents in mixed-income developments has been built or rehabilitated, according to the authority's 2007 annual plan. That represents about 2,270 new dwellings for people with permanent relocation rights on a waiting list of 15,000 families. (And beyond those who were displaced by the demolitions, there are more than 90,000 people from the general public on another waiting list for public housing.)
 Under the transformation plan, the Housing Authority also set out to rehabilitate 5,000 units of public housing for families by 2010. So far, 1,733 units have been delivered, the annual plan said. The time frame for everything has been extended to 2015.
 The authority has produced housing much more quickly for its older citizens, rehabilitating almost all of the 9,438 units it promised. It has also rehabilitated more than 2,500 units for families in so-called scattered sites around the city.
 ''What drives us is money,'' said Sharon Gist Gilliam, the chief executive of the Housing Authority. ''If I could get my hands on a quick $2 billion we could get this done in three or four years.'' 
 There are signs of hope: Just across from what remains of Cabrini Green are new mixed-income communities that are thriving as models for the future. Many more are on the way but housing officials point to rising construction costs as their main obstacle to a faster delivery. 
 With so much of the project gone now, residents said the problems have not disappeared so much as been concentrated. Housing officials insist that the buildings are well maintained and that there is a constant police presence.
 The place tells its own story.
 Drug dealers form thickets in the lobbies so deep that it resembles a crowded market. The elevators are often out of service, forcing residents into stairwells that addicts have claimed for their own purposes. 
 And then there are the squatters.
 ''I want to be out of here so bad,'' said Sierra Milton, who lives on the 14th floor of one of the last towers. ''There are people hiding everywhere, in the hallways, around the corners. I want to go because I'm scared. I've been living here since 1998 and this is the worst I ever felt.''
 Nikia Evans was born on the fifth floor of the Green Homes because an ambulance did not make it to her mother in time. She is still there, along with her aunt and grandmother, waiting for a time and place to move. The uncertainty is unsettling. 
 ''I heard that we were getting vouchers,'' said Ms. Evans, who works at a catalog call center and qualifies for a voucher. ''But I've heard so many stories I don't know what to believe.''
 Two doors down, Ms. Evans's aunt, Thelma Hicks, 67, sought to reassure the family.
 ''If I had a choice, I'd stay here because this is my roots,'' she said. ''But we know things change. And we always have to be open to new things. It's hard to deal with this but they say things will change for the best. We'll see.''

HEADLINE: Abu Dhabi Explores Energy Alternatives

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH

DATELINE: ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates, March 14 

 BODY:
On the outskirts of this Persian Gulf boomtown, past an oil refinery and a water desalination plant, the foundations are being poured for an ambitious project that will house a research facility and perhaps even a power plant, all intended to take this oil-producing giant into the next energy wave. 
 Oil, however, will have nothing to do with it. The sun, the wind and hydrogen will. 
Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, the fourth largest OPEC oil producer with about 10 percent of the known reserves, is seeking to become a center for the development and implementation of clean-energy technology. 
 Last year, the emirate launched the Masdar Initiative (masdar is Arabic for source), which has signed up major oil and technology companies, universities around the world and U.A.E. ministries to help develop and commercialize renewable-energy technologies backed by hundreds of millions of dollars of Abu Dhabi's money.
 At first, the Masdar effort drew skepticism and a few snickers. The United Arab Emirates has been singled out as one of the world's highest per capita emitters of carbon monoxide and other greenhouse gases. 
 The U.A.E. has especially high energy demand to maintain a luxurious life of air-conditioning, chilled swimming pools and even an indoor ski slope in the emirate of Dubai, a neighbor of Abu Dhabi. U.A.E. officials say the Masdar project is one way to reduce demand for fossil fuels internally.
 The U.A.E. is only the most serious among Persian Gulf oil-producing countries whose thirst for electrical power has spawned efforts to find other sources of energy to save high value fossil fuels for export. Most Persian Gulf states get their water from desalinating gulf waters, an energy-intensive process. With their populations growing rapidly, domestic consumption of oil is commanding a greater share of production. Late last year Saudi Arabia and other gulf states began a research program looking into nuclear power; Iran, which has faced off with the United States and other international powers, insists that its nuclear program is intended to serve mounting energy demands domestically. 
 Some other Arab countries have dabbled with renewable energy. The Bahrain World Trade Center project in Bahrain includes wind turbines that, developers say, will meet up to 35 percent of the project's power needs. In North Africa and in countries like Jordan, residents have been encouraged to adopt solar heating to save energy costs. 
 The Masdar Initiative, however, is the most far-reaching program. 
 ''They've seen the writing on the wall: where will all these places be, post-oil?'' said Virginia Sonntag-O'Brien, managing director of BASE, a center in Basel, Switzerland, that promotes investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy. ''It's their message that they are an oil-producing nation taking the energy and climate issue seriously and developing their own economy, which is important.'' 
 Alternative energy has attracted increasing interest over the past year as American industrial leaders have called for more aggressive action to be taken against the phenomenon of global warming and the Bush administration has focused greater attention on renewable energy. In Silicon Valley, the excitement over clean-energy technology startups recalls the flurry of new Internet companies in the 1990s.
 From its gleaming high-rise towers to its $3 billion marble-encrusted Emirates Palace Hotel, Abu Dhabi has long prided itself on being an example of what oil money, put to good use, can do. Oil helped turn Abu Dhabi from desert fishing village into an influential Arab capital. It helped build a citizens' trust fund that is estimated to be worth up to $300 billion, whose investments are estimated to bring the emirate almost twice income as its oil sales do. 
 Now, Abu Dhabi hopes to show that petrodollars can develop innovation in clean energy. Masdar has drawn up a $250 million Clean Technology Fund, and begun construction of a special economic zone for the advanced energy industry. Last month, Abu Dhabi announced plans to build a 500-megawatt solar power plant in the area -- one of the most ambitious of its kind in the world.
 The plant will be the Persian Gulf's first, to be built in partnership with the Abu Dhabi Power and Water Authority, generating enough power for up to 10,000 homes. It should be operational by 2009, either as a stand-alone or as part of a desalination project. 
 Shortly after it announced those plans, Masdar announced an even more ambitious project to develop a graduate-level research center in combination with M.I.T. that will be focused on renewable-energy technologies. Scientists who join the program will be able to attend M.I.T. courses in Boston and will be assisted in developing research and courses at Abu Dhabi. M.I.T. administrators liken the effort to one that the university spearheaded in Bangalore during the 1960s that helped create the high-tech corridor there. 
 ''This is the first oil-producing state that has accepted and agreed with the concept that oil may not be the only source of energy in the future,'' said Fred Moavenzadeh, director of the Technology Development Program at M.I.T. ''That is a significant realization.''
 In a decade, Masdar's executives and M.I.T.'s administrators predict, Abu Dhabi is likely to have expertise in solar energy, photovoltaics, energy storage, carbon sequestration and hydrogen fuel. 
 Most important, they say, it hopes to prepare itself for a world that is not as reliant on fossil fuels as it is today. Abu Dhabi's expertise, they say, is in energy, not just in oil.
 ''We realize that the world energy markets are diversifying, so we need to diversify too,'' said Sultan A. al-Jaber, chief executive of the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company, the government arm that manages the Masdar Initiative. ''We see the growth of renewable energy as an opportunity, not as a problem.''
 Experts warn that the big investments have yet to occur, but note that the progress has underscored Masdar's seriousness. 
 ''For a player in that world to recognize that there's this other component to the energy business is itself a recognition that the world is changing,'' said Marc Stuart, director of new business development at EcoSecurities, a company that structures and guides projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement that seeks to curb global warming, and also trades in credits earned by companies that make deep cuts. 
 ''It is a very significant move because the Middle East is one of the areas where renewable energy has never made any strides.''
